","Home Alone is a nostalgic film for me , having watched it religiously when I was a young kid growing up ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Roger Ebert gave this film a 2 . 5 out of 4 .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",He calls the film unrealistic and says that it goes in another direction from the original premise .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Home Alone plays on the scary scenario every kid fears at some point in their life .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Kevin McCallister ( Macaulay Culkin ) is forgotten at home in Chicago when his family rushes off to the airport for their trip to Paris .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Soon after , Kevin is visited by home invaders Marv ( Daniel Stern ) and Harry ( Joe Pesci )"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","and it""s up to him to stop them ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Ebert complains that this film deviates from the main premise and simply brings in stunt doubles
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","and fills the film with wacky traps that would otherwise cost the McCallister""s tens of thousands of dollars to accomplish what Kevin does ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","While this is not far from the true , you""re supposed to suspend some disbelief when watching this ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",I enjoy Home Alone because an 8 - year old handles two grown up burglars .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","I don""t enjoy watching people getting hurt ,"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","but I think in this case , there is an exception ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","The moral of the story is that even when you""re young , you can still be responsible"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",and handle your home from being invaded .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","It shows that it""s wrong to rob people"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",and that even children can be heroes .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","However , I find that the sequel is much better than this and it""s due to the far superior story setup ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Kevin being left home alone was a great initial start and opening up to the opportunity of a follow up story .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","To review this film without the mention of Macaulay""s acting is a crime ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Macaulay portrays Kevin with amazing talent and it""s great for the simple fact that the 90s weren""t really big for their child actors as far as I can remember ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Macaulay is able to hit all ends of the acting spectrum showing being scared , showing emotion ,"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","and showing confidence and hilarious comedic relief , too ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",He was a great actor and I was sad to only see a few of his films before he retired .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",Another great point about Home Alone being a cult classic is the musical score provided by legendary John Williams .
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
",He gives the film the final emotional touch that allows us to forever remember Home Alone as being a classic film
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","and never forget Macaulay""s performance ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","Somewhere in My Memory has always been a favourite track of mine by Williams and it""s just a great piece of music on top of a great film ."

","This film is a classic for me ,"
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","and I would never say that this isn""t a wonderful film , despite being a tad bit unrealistic ."
Jerique,8,7,8,7 April 2011," Better than Ebert thinks...
","But , the fact is , most films exaggerate"

","When it comes to enjoying that jolly time of year , there are several movies that must be viewed or else it just isn""t Christmas ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","One of those is 1990""s "" Home Alone "" ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","Written and produced by the late , great John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus , it follows the story of young Kevin McCallister ( Played by Macaulay Culkin , arguably the best child actor since Shirley Temple ) who""s constantly picked on"
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","and looked down upon by his large , extended family but especially by his older and much hated brother , Buzz ( Devin Ratray in what has to be his best role ) ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","On the eve of the big family vacation , Kevin lashes out"
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","and gets sent to the attic by his impatient mom ( The talented and ravishing Catherine O""Hara ) and right then Kevin makes the prophetic wish of never seeing his family again ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","Little does he know , his wish is about to come true when due to a convenient power outage , his parents "" alarm clocks fails to go off"
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","and the result is sheer holiday hell as everybody scrambles like there""s no tomorrow to catch that flight ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","Everybody that is , except little Kevin who""s forgotten by everyone and as the title says , is left home alone ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
",Shock turns to happiness as Kevin realizes his wish has come true .
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","But it""s not all fun and games as two naughty burglars Harry and Marv ( Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern who give a wonderful performance together as the two bumbling thieves ) are on the rampage in Kevin""s neighborhood ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","Rather than running away like most kids might do , Kevin decides to fight back using his creativity and some simple but potentially bone shattering traps ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","It all might sound like a simple holiday comedy to be watched and then put away ,"
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","but there""s something more to the film that keeps me and many others coming back year after year ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","To be sure , the physical comedy of Harry and Marv getting their asses handed to them by Kevin""s traps is nothing short of a laugh riot ( Traps include anything from heated door handles to slippery steps ) ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","But the film also manages to include a lot of heart as Kevin slowly but surely begins to realize that family is what the holidays are all about and without them it""s pretty lonely , a lesson he learns first hand by the at first feared but then loved neighborhood recluse , Old Man Marley ( the late , great character actor Robert Blossom ) ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
",John Williams score to this is undoubtedly one of his best as it is both grand and yet not overbearing in the least .
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","On the contrary , it manages to invoke the spirit of Christmas in all of us while giving us the chills because of its beauty ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","And of course , who can forget the performance of Macaulay Culkin since the film rests on his shoulders more than anything else ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","With his mischievous grin and resourcefulness , we just can""t help"
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
",but love his character and root for him all the way through the film .
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","I should also mention that the movie includes a small but very memorable performance by the legendary John Candy ( Try not to laugh at the conversation he has with Kevin""s mom in the back of the van ! ) ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
",""" Home Alone "" is one of those films that no matter how many times you might see it , it just never gets old ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","The movie is a time capsule in many ways because it somehow captured not only the holiday spirit but also the magic of the time it was made in , the 90""s , a time where not only were the movies better but so was everything else ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","It is for that reason that movie will live on forever and ever , much like the spirit of Christmas itself ."
bayardhiler,10,5,7,17 December 2013," Never Gets Old
","So without further adieu , I urge you to watch this modern classic"

","No superheroes , no Transformers , no magical superpowers , the ( r)evolution was on march , sure , but it didn""t take much at that time to draw audience to the theaters , what counted was a simple concept and an appealing main character ."

",The concept here is simply terrific : what would happen if a boy was left alone in his home ?

","And during Christmas holidays at that , and when the kid is played by such an adorable and talented kid as Macaulay Culkin , half the work is done ."
ElMaruecan82,8,1,1,22 December 2017," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","There""s also an interesting implication , every kid would love to be alone in such a big home ( granted he""s got enough to eat or buy food )"

",but how about when it happens at the very time where you count on the presence of adults .... Even for selfish reasons .
ElMaruecan82,8,1,1,22 December 2017," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","I concede that John Hughes didn""t really try to make an existential plot out of the concept ,"
ElMaruecan82,8,1,1,22 December 2017," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","and picked the easy way , which was a confrontation between the boys and bad guys ..."
ElMaruecan82,8,1,1,22 December 2017," The first Christmas classic of the 90's!
","But what bad guys ! As Hitchcock said , a film is as good as the villain and Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern form a very interesting variation of "" Laurel and Hardy "" , "" George and Lenny "" , "" George and Junior "" or "" Pinky and the Brain "" , the interaction between the two burglars while not reinventing the wheel , is the perfect foil to little Kevin""s quick wits , agility and ability to come up with the most ingenuous devices in order to "" defend his home "" ."
