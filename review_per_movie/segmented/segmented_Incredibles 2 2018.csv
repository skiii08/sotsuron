MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","To be clear from the get go , I""m a huge fan of the first film so my expectations were high ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","After watching it a few times now I""ve struggled to put my finger on what bugs me about it compared to the first one , but finally it came to me ! First , here""s what you""ll love about this film : The quality of animation(colours , lighting , explosions etc ) - They managed to beautifully create an even better world of super heroes compared to the first film ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
",The storyline - This was somewhat predictable
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","and they certainly made the direction of the film obvious in terms of the "" parenting "" aspects of super hero life ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","The voice acting - As in the first film this has some great voice actors in to carry the film""s drama and emotion ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","So , what wasn""t so , Incredible ? ... Sorry I couldn""t resist : In non - animated films you have good actors and bad actors ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
",Of course these animated films aim to create believable personalities and behaviours that are acted to a high standard .
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","Unfortunately for me this film just doesn""t achieve this , most noticeably with Mr. Incredible . I can""t help"
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","but feel like I""m just watching someone overact every emotion possible , distracting through every conversation"
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
",and even being flat - out annoying in certain scenes .
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","The pacing is also off , the entire first half of the film feels like everyone""s on cocaine ."
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
",Where are the pauses ? The contemplation before an answer ? Nowhere .
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","Still , it""s admirable to see Pixar aiming for a down to earth , emotional films with action sequences often just about making up for the disjointed conversational scenes , also the twist in the story is decent"
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
",and I for one did not make a correct prediction which is always nice .
MikeOzen,7,2,2,2 January 2019," Great! Just not quite as Incredible as the first...
","Bottom Line : If you""ve not even seen the first film , you""ll probably love this ."

bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",Films are manipulation of the audience .
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","They manipulate our feelings through pictures , music , sound , acting , mise - en - scene , editing etc ... Disney and Pixar represent the absolute mainstream of film - making ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","It almost is expected of them to send messages to their supposedly young audience ( although I can""t imagine all the hate comments were written by the target audience ... ) ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",Most of the time Disney sends out messages to manipulate us .
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","Sometimes it""s "" It""s okay to be different "" , sometimes "" friendship is important "" , "" Stay true to yourself "" or "" fight for your dream "" ."

",Almost everybody can relate to those .

","In Incredibles 2 it""s time for female empowerment ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",This is just as valid as the other messages I mentioned
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","but as you can see when you read other comments about the film , it creates some controversy ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","I think it""s unfair to shout "" Propaganda ! ! "" here"
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","and not also talk about Moana , Frozen and other films that have strong female characters ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?

","Mr Incredible isn""t weak here ."

",He actually is the most relatable of all the Parr family .

","Elasti - Girl isn""t better than him ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","She puts career and the "" greater good "" before family ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",This is controversial at least .
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","She also draws wrong conclusions , needs rescuing and isn""t the most capable of the Supers ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",So what is all the fuzz about ? This is a fun film that has a message not everybody might enjoy
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
",but that is equally important in our day and age .
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","Yes , it might be too much for 5 year old kids ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","Then for god""s sake , don""t take your 5 year old to a film that""s about a superhero family"
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","and takes about 2 hours ! See "" Cars "" again on Disney channel ! I truly enjoyed the spy movie spoof moments , the whole family dynamic , the humour ( for lots of the jokes it also helps if you""re older than 5 ... ) , the animation and yes , also the message , although I admit it is quite in - your - face ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","If like me you don""t trust 1 - star and 10 - star ratings , watch the "" Incredibles 2 "" ."
bjoernidler,8,3,5,6 March 2019," What's with all the hate?
","I can""t imagine any sane person that enjoyed the first part or the "" How to train your dragon "" films to leave the cinema truly disappointed ."

","Finally , this is a way better sequel than "" Finding Dori "" was ."

","There""s a Lot wrong here"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","TL ; DR While this film is visually and aurally appealing in Pixar standards , this film drops a lot of the aspects that made the original Incredibles unique in favor of a more box office friendly approach ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","As a preface , I adored the first Incredibles growing up ,"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","and after re - watching it in preparation for this film , I still adore it ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","So , this review will carry some bias , because I think the Incredibles 2 is a perfectly OK film by itself ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","What this film has going is its updated visuals , interesting and engaging action scenes , and music ; or in general its aesthetic ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","Originally Director Brad Bird wanted the visuals of the Incredibles to mimic that of those Golden Age - Superhero posters back in the 50s/60s ,"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","and while the first film did a great job in context to what technology was available , this sequel nails it ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","The skyscrapers were massive and follow the simple geometry of modernist architecture , the trains , cars , and other vehicles were all futuristic in a modernist sense ( again ) , the music while not so different from the original film was still magnificent and brassy , and the action was very impressive and flashy whereas the original film didn""t have too many opportunities to show off this sort of choreography ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","And while the plot , characters , and script were meh , without the context of the original this film is a perfectly OK 5/10"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",and a perfect rental if you want to appreciate the high quality artistic direction that Pixar produces .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","Now that being said , this film loses almost all the magic the original had ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","To keep this readable , I""ll just mention two of the most annoying aspects of the film"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",but be sure I had other qualms with this film
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",and you can find most of them in other reviews .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",The first aspect is line delivery .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","In re - watching the original , I noticed how snappy , quick , and sticky the dialogue was ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",Most people I know have at least memorized 2 scenes from the original
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",and I can almost guarantee YOU the reader know the super suit scene by heart .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","Now how many lines from the Incredibles 2 can you recite ? Maybe the "" Math is Math "" line"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",but that might be it .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","One part of why this is because the voice actors who weren""t in the original did not follow the cadence and speed that original voice actors , the most blatant violator being the voice actor for Void ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","Instead of sounding like someone who is a part of this 50s/60s - quick talking world , her nervous west coast girl delivery sounds sorely out of place like the picture of the time - travelling hipster ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","The closest voice actor to get to the delivery was Bob Odenkirk ,"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",but even he would sound out of place if he was casted in the original film
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",and kept the same delivery .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",This aspect is hard to explain in words
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","and this is more of guttural reaction to the dialogue , but hopefully if you re - watch the original you can tell too ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",The other aspect was how much this film just felt so standard .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","It has X number of action scenes , it has Y number of funny scenes , it needed to have 5 Jack Jack scenes , etc etc ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","The magic of the first film was how reserved the animation was to let the character designs , subtle facial animation , and dialogue shine ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",It is amazing how re - watchable the First Act is being it was primarily in a gray office building .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",There are so many scenes in the original Incredibles that were shot - reverse shot .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
",A true sign of a director following an inspired vision to the end .
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","What about the Incredibles 2 ? It relies heavily on a compilation of scenes that halt the progress of the plot to produce oohs , aahs , and laughter ( talking to you Jack Jack , raccoon , and Edna ) instead of quality scenes that can do the same ( albeit less flashy ) and give us insight into characters and conflicts ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","Overall , I can not discredit the Incredibles 2 too much for these aspects because these aspects are what I got from the original , me alone ."
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","If you want to watch a 3D animated movie with your family , go ahead"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","and pop this on your living room screen ,"
djkimtech,4,5,17,18 August 2018," Losing the Incredibles Magic
","but if you want to watch a movie like the Incredibles , you will probably be disappointed ."

kjproulx,9,3,13,15 June 2018," The Movie Everyone's Been Waiting For

","For many of this film""s harsh critics , this is a breaking point ,"

",The Good : This plot contains a lot of satire for a movie marketed towards children .

",and sometimes so much so that it becomes intentionally cringe - inducing and uncomfortable because this animated movie becomes too real .

",The Bad : Some of the plot is very predictable .
kronicton,8,1,3,17 June 2018," Great Movie, But Flawed (Epilepsy Warning)
","I watched this movie with my family and about thirty minutes in , we could guess what would happen an hour later ."

","Some of the plot also seems a bit recycled from the original movie ,"

","but fourteen years later , it still feels fresh enough to pass off for most viewers ."

","This isn""t really part of the plot ,"
kronicton,8,1,3,17 June 2018," Great Movie, But Flawed (Epilepsy Warning)

","The first movie is about trusting your family and cop with society ,"
