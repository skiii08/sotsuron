","Final Destination , or Flight 180 "" as it was titled right up until the last minute , was a surprise hit of 2000 ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",It was made with a modest budget of $ 23 m it grossed a nice sum of $ 53 m in the US .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","It was in the UK , however , where the film really shone , up against the massive epic Gladiator at the time the movie managed to gross a none too bad Â£ 11 m but what made it better was it was a true sleeper hit , it spent 14 weeks in the UK film charts ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","With no big name actors , and no major publicity the film did so well because of word of mouth and the word was it was damn good ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",I admit I was sceptical at first in reading about Final Destination .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","It seemed like a tired teen horror movie that seemed to be spewing out of America at that time , indeed it was only until about 3 weeks in to it being released that I actually lifted my bum off my sofa"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and put my bum on the seat in front of the big screen to actually watch the movie .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","I loved it , and it was made better by the low expectations I had of it . It isn""t groundbreaking"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","but it is effectively chilly at times , the acting is surprisingly good"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and the plot is pretty fresh .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","James Wong ( X Files ) came up with the idea of the movie , about cheating death ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and it does seem to have a kind of X Files ring to it .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",The story goes as follows .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Alex ( Devon Sawa ) is off , with his classmates , to France ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Now being in America France is like our version ofAmerica , so it""s a pretty big deal ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","While on the plane he has a premonition of the plane exploding , slightly scared , he wakes up"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and finds that some of his premonition turns out real .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Scared for his life , and the others on the plane , he cause a fuss which sees him and several other classmates chucked off the plane ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Some of his companions are none too pleaseduntil they see Flight 180 blow up , killing everyone on the plane ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",Thus begins the cat and mouse chase by Death himself .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","One by one , in seemingly accidental "" ways , the survivors of the ill - fated crash are dying ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","While others dismiss the idea of Death coming for revenge , Alex isn""t going to let it go"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and soon he convinces friend Clear ( Ali Larter ) that it is up to them to try and stop Death himself .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",As this happens we can witness some of the most imaginative death scenes ever .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Thanks to the movie not having a masked killer doing the rounds the death scenes are not limited to the knife in back / stomach / head / eye "" routine ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Indeed , the first death scene is both funny and horrific all in one because , like with many of the deaths in this movie , it can really seem as that can actually happen ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",It gives you something to think about .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","The special effects , for a movie with as small as budget as this , are excellent ( apparently they did actually spend half of their budget in the SFX ) ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see , its worrying to watch ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","For a movie aimed at the teenager end of the market , and for a genre renowned for hammy acting , the people in this movie actually do a good job ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Devon Sawa , no stranger to movies , is perfect at playing the lead role of the troubled Alex ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Kerr Smith ( Dawson""s Creek ) does a major turnaround from what you are used to seeing him as , this time he""s the typical school jock , flash car , blonde girlfriend , bad temper ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","but luckily he doesn""t play it into overkill ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Another nice surprise is Sean William Scott ( American Pie , Road Trip , Too many teen movies ) , while we are used to seeing him as the guy who cracks jokes and makes fun of the others , he plays the geeky guy this time , and he provides us with quite a bit of comic relief ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","We also have a nice cameo of Tony Todd ( aka the Candyman ) as Bludworth , who plays the man at the morgue , he is suitably chilling ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",and is set to play a larger part in the sequel .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Suspense wise this film doesn""t fail either ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",In many films like this you are guessing who will be killed next .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",Not so in this movie .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",You are actually told who is going to meet Death next .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","However this doesn""t spoil it ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",Suspense is carried over by how the person will die .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","If you know a person is going to die as soon as the camera pans of them , and their all alone , then your waiting in anticipation for them to die ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",but there are many false scares along the way .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Also the suspense is kept up throughout the movie , it doesn""t seem to drag too much at any time ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",There are very few bad points to the movie .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Obviously it will depend on your taste whether you like it or not , whether you consider it too teeny "" or too teeny"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",but just right anyway .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",This film does have fun as well as generate scares .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","It is worth noting that there is an alternate ending to the movie and quite a few deleted scenes , namely a main subplot where Clear becomes pregnant ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","I think that it was wise to omit these parts , the ending seemed cheesy ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",but the one we are left with is excellent .
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","Final Destination , thanks to an imaginative story , nice acting and some elaborate death scenes breathes new life into the tired genre of teen horror ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","It is not as widely recognized as the Scream trilogy ,"
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
","but in many respects it""s better ."
3rdRockSatan,Null,79,95,4 November 2001," Death Becomes You
",Lets hope the sequel maintains the high standard it has set .

Alcaminhante,Null,0,1,10 August 2000," WEÂ´RE ALL GONNA DIE !!!!
",But ... Despite all this ... The idea is excellent
Alcaminhante,Null,0,1,10 August 2000," WEÂ´RE ALL GONNA DIE !!!!
","and not so badly developed as it looks , the usual "" teen - clichÃ©s "" never get over the story just to fill screen time , there are no f@#%-up dudes slashing teens with knifes , the deaths are original although by the end they got totally predictable ( this is a Hollywood teen flic after all ) , the movie sometimes can get very uncomfortable because it has a brilliant dark creepy atmosphere ,"
Alcaminhante,Null,0,1,10 August 2000," WEÂ´RE ALL GONNA DIE !!!!
","and despite all the shallow action and plot dumbness FINAL DESTINATION , still can put people talking about its theme . Death and destiny ."

","Because in the middle of all that sometimes Hollywood mess , this story still raises interesting questions ."
