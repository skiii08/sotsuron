","Considering its many affiliations with American HUSTLE ( noted in that film""s review ) , it is interesting to watch how in the former , the F. B. I. Emerged as foolhardy in their undeniably well - meaning approach – while here they are treated more or less as the heroes of the day when their operation proves a resounding success ! Anyway , much has been said of this latest Martin Scorsese / Leonardo Di Caprio collaboration – especially in how it treads the line of tastelessness for much of its 3 hour duration ( with some of the admittedly over - the - top sex""n""drugs antics seeming to belong more in a grindhouse or even "" Euro - Cult "" movie from the 1970s ! ) ."

Indeed , to Scorsese""s credit , if the Jordan Belfort gang""s scamming of both poor and rich people was dealt with so thoroughly – or , should I say , the rewards they reaped from it – these characters "" fall from grace is at least as detailed and spectacular ; so , in that respect , it comes off as a balanced evaluation of a particular lifestyle which , like it or not , existsand to which gullible people themselves contribute in a misguided attempt to increase their own bank account without having to work for it !

To go back to its ties with American HUSTLE , the F. B. I. Sequences necessarily recall those of Scorsese""s earlier and superior GOODFELLAS ( 1990 ) – which suggests that its best ( and funniest ) moments tend to involve the after - effects of the copious intake of drugs , notably DiCaprio getting tongue - tied during a vital telephone call and his "" spastic "" attempts to reach his luxurious car and drive back home ."

","Given the unsubtle condemnation of the Wall Street stockbroker approach and lifestyle in Oliver Stone""s 1987 movie , Wall Street , it would seem to clarify the basis of The Wolf of Wall Street , a movie that makes all of Oliver Stone""s most barbarous neutering of the overindulgence on the stock exchange look like a walk in the park by comparison ."

",Martin Scorsese is easily one of the greatest directors still working today and The Wolf of Wall Street just keeps on showing us why he is such an incredible director and storyteller with an almost absurd amount of excitement and passion for the art of filmmaking .
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","In a lot of ways , The Wolf of Wall Street feels like something of a follow - up to two of his most beloved and acclaimed movies , Casino and Goodfellas even though the movie takes place in its own universe and Jordan Belfort is a professional convict who does more harm with a pen than a gun in the film ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.

","Much like the casinos of Las Vegas in Casino or the Irish Mob of Boston in The Departed , Wall Street is depicted as a bona fide playground for those people with no moral high ground ."

","Early on in the film , some of the characters are having a conversation about tossing short people at targets for their own delight and going through what can or can""t be done in terms of entertainment ."

","Selfishness and fraud are depicted here as wide - ranging and irresistible as Jordan""s decadence is nothing short of outlandish"

andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Of course , the movie is quite honest about it""s leading character , Jordan Belfort who may seem like your typical lawbreaker and scam artist but is also an erratic storyteller ."

",and later with Silence that Martin has matured greatly as a filmmaker and a storyteller .
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","This movie , however , feels more like a bigger step for Scorsese and company as well as a much more adventurous and unproven with Scorsese continuously pulling the viewer""s leg with how phony the movie really is ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Masterfully aided by Terrence Winters "" wonderful screenplay , Martin crafts a hazy impression of hyper - reality around the movie""s events , making it feel like something in a drug - fueled fog ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Of course , Scorsese constantly pulls the viewer""s attention to the fact that the movie they""re watching is , in fact , a movie as the aspect ratio always seems to continuously alter as the film progresses as even the boundaries of the screen change from scene to scene which fits with the story that the film is trying to show us ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Marketing also plays a high part in The Wolf of Wall Street such as when Belfort fills the viewer on the facts surrounding a crazy money laundering scam or when the FBI arrest Jordan while he""s filming a commercial but the agents don""t stop with just apprehending Belfort as they also process to directly interrupt the entire shot - on - camera scene making for easily one of finest apprehension scenes in film history ."

","It""s also one of the boldest and divisive storytelling ideas in the movie ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Also effective in the story that The Wolf of Wall Street is telling is how Scorsese grants Dicaprio free rein over the movie""s plot ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","At one point , Belfort""s voice - over straightens out the movie over the color of his car , giving the viewer an awareness of Jordan""s preferences in telling his own story through the narration rather than just explaining what is happening to us as the movie certain enough to let Belfort to show us his story unfolding on the screen rather than just dumping explanation dialog on us like some other movies have a tendency to do ."

","At its heart , The Wolf of Wall Street is in essence penned as a cavalier endeavor at self - defense by a calculating maniac as he goes through various stages of decadence and self - indulgence as well as having to deal with the government breathing down his neck at every turn ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Unlike directors like Paul Feig or Michael Bay who often insult the viewer""s intelligence , Martin Scorsese trusts us enough to allow us to use our brains in order to realize that Jordan can""t be trusted which might seem like a massive jump for a movie director of Scorsese""s caliber but taking into account the movie has generated debates about how it portrays Belfort much like how Pulp Faction has kindled similar disputes , it would seem that Martin has misjudged filmgoers"
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","and , yet the movie never once makes any sort of sympathy pea for Jordan or even paste a convenient moralistic accusation over the end credits as it simply isn""t essential for what the film is showing us ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","Any person watching the movie who can""t even use their brain to figure out how disgraceful Jordan is , regardless of his efforts to justify his behavior , would have to be very improbable to be convinced by a corny afterthought or a condescending honest condemnation ."
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
","The film is continuously harsh in its judgment of Jordan , so much so that the FBI agent that is questioning him seems to find Belfort notably repulsive due to there being no justification for his extreme excess as Jordan wasn""t born into this lifestyle"
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.
",but rather chose to live it which in turn makes the story all the more complex and compelling .
andrewnmiller,10,3,6,8 October 2018," Excess to the extreme.

Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Let""s start by saying that this movie isn""t for everyone ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Like usual in Scorsese""s movies , this film is also filled with explicit scenes , explicit language and explicit everything , however the tremendous difference between this movie and most other explicit movies is that the wolf of wall street is not just a movie ,"
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",but a piece of art .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Starting with the first scene I had an instant flashback to Casino , in which Scorsese also used the unique narrator - technique throughout the movie ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Ironically Casino also had a hard time when it first came out in theaters , because just like TWOWS people were shocked by the explicit language and the amount of violence used in the movie ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And yet nowadays Casino is seen a one of the greatest movies in the oeuvre of Scorsese .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And I think this is also a bit the problem with this movie .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Most people are surprised by how the movie is filmed and by the many nude scenes because of the fact that most people expect to see a biographical crime drama .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","But just like many of Scorsese""s films this movie is a mere reflection of today""s society"
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",and moreover it is a direct attack to the how Wall Street abused the people and money they had and how this lead to the many crisis the world is face with today .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And this is were the protagonist of The Wolf of Wall Street meets the characters from Goodfellas and Casino .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Like them Dicaprio""s character doesn""t want to be saved , he doesn""t want to be a good guy ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",In fact he even chooses to remain bad when he is offered a deal to avoid jail time .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And that is were TWOWS encounters Henry Hill ( from Goodfellas .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Hill also didn""t want to be a hero , he wanted to be a wise guy ,"
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","but in the end he had to cooperate with the FBI , just like in this movie ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And this is why I believe this movie is without doubt a Goodfellas - Casino mix without any of the weaker point these movies had .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Overall this movie is definitely Oscar - material .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Like usual it starts with the cutting and editing .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Only one director in Hollywood has been so obsessed with the editing of his movies .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Like Raging Bull The wolf of wall street has a number of scenes were the editing is just phenomenal .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","Also the soundtrack is once again perfectly chosen , Scorsese knows where to put certain songs and places for instance the happy song ça plaine pour moi in the dramatic rescue scene ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And this is only one of the many examples .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","And then there is the acting , Leonardo Dicaprio performs at his best ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",This movie is once again an example of just how big an actor he is .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","But it must be said he is accompanied by none other than Jonah Hill , which was I must say an extremely dangerous choice as Jonah is not the star actor Leonardo is ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",Nonetheless Hill gives here a performance that will literally blow you away .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",And last but not least there is the directing .
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","It is funny how even now no one asks himself is the new Scorsese good are bad ? Instead you just ask yourself how good is he , because well , he doesn""t make bad movies ."
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
","In conclusion it can be said that this movie is without doubt not for everyone ,"
Goodfellasz,10,5,14,19 January 2014," goodfellas meets Casino
",but it can not be argued that this movie will without doubt be one of the greatest movies released in 2014 .

","It has been a major criticism of The Wolf of Wall Street that its main protagonist , the anti - hero , Jordan Belfort ( Leonardo Dicaprio ) is not seen to truly get his come - uppance ."
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
","There has been a suggestion that the film is a glorification of his lifestyle and practices , that it , through not outwardly condemning them , tacitly supports them ."

",The now largely forgotten Somerset Maugham – the most popular writer in the English language for much of the first half of the Twentieth Century - often faced similar criticism .

TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
",Director Martin Scorsese and scriptwriter Terence Winter seem to have adopted a similar line .
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
","They have simply told their version as they saw it : the story of a man corrupted by greed whose habit was fed by those who were only too keen to invest greedily in schemes where they thought they could make a quick , easy buck ."
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
",It is ironic that many of those who now complain Belfort is portrayed too sympathetically were those investors prepared to do anything to get money apart from work for it .
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
","If Scorsese""s film has a moral lesson , it is that people should not be seduced by the thought of soft profit ."

",His charisma oozes from every pore and is essential to his characterisation – what conman was ever successful by being dour and self - deprecating ? His skillful piece of acrobatic acting as he opened his car door with his foot when out of his mind on Quaaludes was laugh out loud funny .
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
",The rest of the cast also rise to the occasion

",The debauchery and female nudity were overdone .

",The solitary scene of a musical band of bare torsoed men seemed to be a contrivance

",and inserted simply to deflect such criticism .

",Much of the female nudity seemed only there for male titillation .
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge
","And a minor criticism of the otherwise excellent Jonah Hill , as Belfont""s sidekick Donnie Azoff ."
TimMeade,8,2,4,1 February 2014," Morality? You Be the Judge

addanilov1,10,2,9,1 March 2014," Brilliant movie about total badass
",but here there mostly modern music and in my opinion it is disadvantage of the movie because the place took place in 80 - s

",And there was a discussion about what is exactly genre of this film .

","Leo DiCaprio as the main character of Jordan Belfort , a stockbroker who conned his way into being one of the most successful brokers in Wall Street ... Illegally ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","The movie is full of nudity and obscenity , they show buttocks , women breasts , sex , or a combination of those almost every 5 minutes of the whole 3 hours of the movie ... Wew ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","In an overall neutral standpoint , I give it a 7 out of 10 score ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","The story streams itself in an irregular way by starting jumping ( and humping , literally ) on to the time when Jordan is on his prime , then slings back on to the time when Jordan""s just beginning to tip his toes on Wall Street ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","The narration is backed well by the monologues that Leo""s Jordan reads directly to the camera addressing the viewers ."

","With the words choices such as those , I""m sure they""ll crack some laughs on the audiences ."

Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","But especially , Leo succeeded in building Jordan Belfort""s character that I myself even believe that I don""t have to read the book on which the movie was based to get to know the real Jordan Belfort ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","I haven""t read the book ,"
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","but the way I see it , the gimmick "" sell me this pen "" may come from the book , and may be the only closest thing one can take home as a sales lesson from this movie ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","Also , I was curious on why did Matt McConaughy only get a part that lasted for only 1/6th of the movie ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
",Matt was great in this movie .
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie

",The rest of the 3 hour was story buildup and a lot of comedy .
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","The scenes of "" cerebral palsy phase , the flight to Switzerland , and Donie""s "" she""s perfect "" scene was all hilarious comedies that also builds the story well ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","There is drama in the movie ,"
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
",but it is very clear that Director Martin Scorcese and Co - Producer Leo DiCaptio were not intending those to be a heavily emphasized points in the movie .

","The divorces , persecution , and jail time was only a brief silent moment compared to the rest of the whacked - out serotonin - dosed movie ."

","In the end , for me the movie was good overall ,"
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
","but it doesn""t really deliver anything more than a wacky dose of entertainment ."
Seraphion,7,0,2,10 July 2014," A really fun movie
",It does really prove Leo can handle wacky comedy too beside his usual action or thriller .

","While admittedly overlong , there is argument to suggest the hefty three- hour run time is justified and reflective of the characters need for excess and corpulence - I don""t particularly buy that argument as the film does feel baggy at times , however given the fantastical nature of Belfort""s story it is understandable that Scorcese would want to include as much as humanly possible for such an ambitious biopic ."

","However , the movie DOES NOT glorify criminal activity , it simply acknowledges it ."
brickmoviereviews,9,0,6,9 January 2014," The Wolf of Wall Street: The Leader of the Pack
","The highlife that Jordan Belfort lived through the majority of the movie is not the message of the story , the message of the story is what happened to Belfort in the final twenty minutes ."

andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","As Belford Dicaprio captures a charisma that is both fascinating and addictive in this character study of a film , as it is made clear from the constant voice - over narrations made by him that all he wants is money ,"
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","and as the story progresses , mostly through the characters , Belford""s quest for power is shown with so very little restraint that you think maybe Scorsese bribed a few Studio execs to get this movie made ."
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","Starting out with a simple marriage ,"
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","and eventually moving up into the big leagues , Jordon Belford began his climb to the top when he founded Stratton Oakmont , a boiler room which marketed penny stocks ."
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","It didn""t take very long for Belford to see the weaknesses in such a small and minuscule business , giving him one chance after another to profit off the gullibility of simple minded people with fraudulent sales stocks ."
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","In time , Jordan formed a cheeky but wise team of swindlers with enough gull and enthusiasm , though not much brains at first , to reach higher and higher levels of monetary gain ."

","His right hand man was Donnie Azoff ( Hill ) , a businessman just as mad , and just as self - destructive as Jordan Bell , and most of this praise goes to the stellar and energetic performance Jonah Hill delivers as he once more breaks from the conventional comedian role into more zany and out of the box characters , following his Oscar nom in 2011 for Moneyball ."

","Aside from this film being a satire and black comedy , it really is not meant to be funny , according to Martin Scorsese ,"

",and that comes from his initial desire to show the darkest aspects of humanity within his characters .
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","In a way , The Wolf of Wall Street shares so much similarity with Scorsese""s 1990 film Good Fellas that as Belford from time again takes us through the story , breaking the fourth wall to add a little humor , it becomes very clear by the confidence , the profanity , and the smug arrogance is the spirit a confident Ray Liaotta had shown in one his role as Henry Hill , who in a way shares so much with Dicaprio""s Jordan Belford that eventually it becomes clear what the story is about ."
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
",And that is the characters and the examination Scorsese takes in portraying this darkly comedic Greek Tragedy .
andy-933-696608,Null,0,6,27 December 2013," My name is Jordan Belford.
","One of the most fascinating aspects that is prevalent within this film is the total lack of restraint it has when giving a gritty and in your face style kind of humor , sadness , and drama to that matter ."

","There rarely goes a scene without Belford popping Quaaludes , or stepping into an orgy where the scene is cynically narrated by his remarkable honesty , and even when any modesty does come from this connoisseur , it is solely for the means of his self - centered agenda of greed and buffoonery ."
