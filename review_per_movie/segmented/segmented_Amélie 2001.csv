","Eventually I did get around to see it , though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does ,"
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!
","and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it ,"

",but I must say I have never been so wrong before .

",And I am happy saying it .
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!
","This movies biggest crime , and yet its biggest asset , is that it is in French ."
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!
","Subtitles just does not bring full justice to a movie like this ,"
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!

","but it is given to us in a very special kind of way , mixed with wonderful little subplots and an almost chaotic amount of details ."

",but in fact is just as big as it is in the eyes of Amelie .

","Some people I spoke to before seeing "" Amelie "" criticized it for being too childish and unrealistic ,"
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!
",but I believe it is an essential part of the movie since Amelie herself is a very childish and imaginative young girl .

",Audrey Tautou could not be overemphasized for her importance in portraying Amelie .

",I am a bit embarrassed admitting it

","However she does not carry "" Amelie "" solely by herself ."

",The cast makes an excellent whole and it is hard imagining switching anyone without affecting the whole outcome .
mucronate,10,697,799,2 January 2003," She makes ME fall in love too!
",Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does .

","I could go on forever about "" Amelie "" ."

nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","I had a laugh at the poor reviews for this movie ... I can only conclude that don""t watch this film if you like action films ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",For me this is my greatest movie of all time
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and I will proceed to tell you why I think this ... 1 ) It does have a story ... It is essentially a love story .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","I am baffled as to how people can""t pick up on that ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",It is a romance and as such it delves into the fantasy feeling of being in love and infatuated with a stranger who you have yet to talk to
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and you have yet to know
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",but your entire body aches to be with them nonetheless ... That adrenaline that rushes through your body and creates that tingly feeling of nerves in your belly .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",The film captures that moment perfectly .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",2 ) The film is visual poetry .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",It is not seeking the harshness of reality ... It is seeking to portray the pretense of love - see point 1 .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",The photography in this film is just amazing
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and the focus on facial expression as a means of dialogue is fantastic .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","While I like heavy dialogue films that are characteristic of a Tarantino film , it is nice to go back to the facial expressions of the silent movie era ..."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",And Jeunet is a master of capturing the face and using actors capable of expressing emotion through the visual .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","The camera angles , the orange tint in the photography and the choice of colours , the attention to minute detail , demonstrate a true artist at work ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","4 ) The acting ... Too many poor reviews are given because of the lack of dialogue other than the narrator ... So I am guessing these people don""t like the silent movies of times gone by ... Nor will they like harsh films such as Hunger or the acclaimed The Artist ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",Expression need not be about words ...
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",And the actors that Jeunet has gathered around him are artists of expression without dialogue .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",Their skill at expressing an array of emotion through the face is astounding .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",5 ) Character development ... We learn so much about the characters in this story in such a short time through a like
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","and hate narrative that builds upon Jeunet""s short film ... Foutaises ( available on youtube with English subtitles ) ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",Ultimately this film is about capturing a single emotion - the first feeling of passion and infatuation when you glance a person you would love to know better .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",It is visually stunning and is about expression through the visual .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","For me the film ticks a lot of boxes that I look for in a film ... I want something that celebrates the visual - if I just wanted a plot then I would read a book , that said , I want something that has a story to tell"
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and this film does have a story ... It is a romance story .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",I look for good photography in a film and for good acting
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and this film delivers on both accounts .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","I also want to leave the film with a memory of the film and feeling whether it be a warm fuzzy feeling like this film delivers , anger , fear , or hate ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",I love films that make me think
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","but those thoughts need not be complexities , this film makes me think about the film and how it was shot ... That alone makes it one of the best films I have seen ... It is great because it makes me think about how it was made as a film ."
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",In that sense I can understand how some reviewers can call the film self - indulgent ... It is ... It celebrates itself ... It celebrates the art of film ( there a number of little things throughout that celebrate film ) in this respect you can draw similarities with Cinema Paradiso .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
","However , ultimately , what makes a great film for me is one that transports me to another place where I am so engrossed in the film that I lose sense of time and when the film comes to an end , I feel as though I have lived as part of the film"
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",and have been away on holiday ... A film that sucks me into itself ... A great film is one that transports you to another place like a great piece of fictional writing in a book ... Where your own reality subsides and is replaced with the temporal vision being portrayed .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",This film delivers in that respect .
nymeria-meliae,10,1,3,5 January 2016," For me the best movie of all time
",It shuts out the outside and replaces it with a visually stunning piece of cinema .

willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","Amélie is of course the French film that was very well received when it first appeared in the early 2000""s"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","and not just from the audiences of France , no Amélie seemed to take the hearts of people from around the world and managed or still manages it should be said to capture the hearts of many who view it ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","Although some claim this to be a masterpiece I don""t think it is quite at that calibre , nevertheless it is still a great movie and one that is highly recommendable , even to those who wouldn""t think they would like it ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","The story centres around well Amélie of course , Amélie Poulain is just a seemingly normal woman working in a Parisian café and lives by herself ,"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",but of course we as the viewer get to see what she is truly like .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",She is not weird really
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","but she is definitely odd ,"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","but Amélie is awesome in this film because she is extremely hard to really dislike or the performance of the lady playing her , Audrey Tautou ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","The plot see""s Amélie do a lot of things actually , she becomes a friend of sorts with a fragile old man , tries to find a young man who caught her eye and messes with her dad , sounds like a very random plot and to be fair , it is ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","The pacing of the film is frantic and speedy , the lines sometimes come out extremely fast"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",and all credit to the cast for really getting the dialogue out in a way which in funny and entertaining .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",Jean - Pierre Jeunet directs the movie
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","and really tells quite a little story at the helm , he makes this super strange"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","but really entertaining and although the decision to colour the movie in terms of lenses is quite a peculiar choice , it actually pretty much works in the end ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",Guillaume Laurant who thought up the story alongside Jeunet then also writes the film
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","and gives Jeunet a great little script to work with , the movie moves along without stopping for too long and that I feel really makes this keep going until the very end ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","I mentioned Tautou as Amélie and she is very good in the role , she very much makes you feel for the character"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",and she is fun to be around as well .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",Serge Merlin as the frail man Amélie befriends is good
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",and works well at the beginning of the story because most other characters take a little while to get used to with the random stuff they say and do .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","Mathieu Kassovitz as Nino Quincampoix is pretty good too , when he is in the film the story is usually at quite a fast part"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",and so Kassovitz does a good job of keeping the pace going so that the movie really does flow very nicely indeed .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","I feel Amélie demands a second watch , I watched this the first time"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","and felt it was pretty basic ,"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
",but on the second watch I truly opened my eyes and saw this for the great film it is .
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","I couldn""t recommend this more to those who haven""t already seen it , it""s fun , oddly thrilling and just generally very different indeed ."
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","So Amélie , a film that showcases how quirky can be done so well"
willcundallreview,8,1,3,11 December 2015," A great little piece of French cinema
","but also shows just how good French cinema can be , oh and this movie is stunning to look at by the way ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Amélie is a film predicated off of a whimsical color pattern - consisting mostly of urine - yellows , pea - greens , and blood - reds - and an impossibly fantastical world with a unique presence at its core ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","It opens by defining the characters that surround our protagonist Amélie Poulain ( the uniquely beautiful Audrey Tautou ) by their strangest , most peculiar quirks ; one character gets deep enjoyment out of using his fingers to elaborately dissect the hot carcus of a turkey and another character""s greatest pleasure is emptying our her purse just to put everything back again ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","In the grand scheme , these quirks are fairly minor ,"
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","but the fact that these are the traits screenwriter Guillaume Laurant wants us to immediately associate these characters with - not a job , a specific education , a personality trait , or a personal history - is , in itself , a tad subversive ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","With that , we finally meet Amélie , a woman who was kept largely sheltered as a child , being homeschooled by her now - dead mother"
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","and , as a result , learning to escape monotony and certain gloom by running away in the realms of her imagination ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Working as a waittress at the Café des 2 Moulins in Montmartre , France , Amélie has consistently led a fairly isolated life largely focused on herself , until one day , her motivations change in the blink of an eye ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Upon hearing the breaking news report concerning the death of Princess Diana , she drops the cap to her perfume , which rolls and eventually dislodges a loose tile ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Behind the tile is a small tin of trinkets , presumably belonging to a young child ."

",Amélie decides it was something of her destiny to find this box
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","and return it to the rightful owner ,"
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","and before long , she finds her destiny of helping others panning out with another circumstance of a lost item ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","The significance and contents of said lost items are irrelevant ; their purpose is to , in turn , provide Amélie with something she never had before and that something is a reason to exist and belong ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Throughout her life , while not depressed nor particularly sad , Amélie""s loneliness has been a constant thing she""s had to battle in her day - to - day actions ; it""s been the typical daily occurrence of her to wake up , go to work , and relish in her alone time for years on end ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","These situations allow her to search for some kind of companionship , further develop her love for humankind , and find maybe even find a romantic partner ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Of course , I""m making this sound a lot more extravagant than I think I should be ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Amélie , through all its color and decorated mise - en- scene , is a drearily familiar story with its original element being the fact that it""s captured in a realm of artificiality that , in turn , makes it appear far more compelling than it ever manages to naturally be ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","It reminds me of the lesser films of Wes Anderson , which weren""t so much concerned about how many objects , costumes ,"
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","and people could be fixed into one particular frame , or the general excitement of dialog as much as they were presentation and eccentric dialog ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","While the visuals in Amélie are colorful marbles ,"
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","and the juxtaposition of characters with cinematographical color ( the work of the great Bruno Delbonnel , who""d go on to work with the Coen brothers and Tim Burton in more recent years ) is unmistakable , these efforts feel more geared to disguise the fact that Amélie is a relatively simple story with little in the way of remarkable themes ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","The presence of scenes ostensibly colored by way of a filter over the lens , canted angles ( most notably during a scene showcasing a character named Bredoteau""s most traumatic moment as a child ) , and lavish setpieces almost entirely blind us by whimsy and warmth until we realize the takeaway from the film is that of an empty candy wrapper ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","There""s something to be said about Tautou , however , who remains an interesting screen presence throughout the film simply because of her presentation ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","Her jet - black hair , petite figure , frequently blood- red wardrobe and lipstick , and ghostly paleness make her protrude out in nearly every scene , even if the background is a pulsating hue of red - as it is in a scene when she reads a letter in a bathroom ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","In addition , scenes in the sex shop bring a fascinating level of warmth to a place often condemned and avoided for its almost inherent seaminess ."
StevePulaski,6,1,3,8 October 2015," A beautiful, but empty, candy wrapper
","But just like I find myself doing now , one winds up remembering Amélie for short , eye - catching scenes rather than a complete film with an impacting takeaway ."

","Sometimes the use of colour gets very obvious ; like Amelies apartment for example it""s almost completely red , the underground stations are kept in green"

",but the romantic comedy genre is not actually my forte but thing that it was nominated for 5 Oscars including best foreign film just kept me excited .. Finally fell into the trap yesterday .. Must admit its a very lovable and entertaining movie with some brilliant performances but it was beyond my comprehension about the hype that surrounded it .. I mean its a good romantic comedy with its moments and all but 5 Oscar nominations is just too much .. May be it had to do with the fact that the Americans just revere anything French but still there were many more deserving candidates for best foreign film nominations other than this in 2001 .

ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","Having spent the best part of the nineties making dark , dank , visual nightmares , French director Jean - Pierre Jeunet began the new millennium with a film so seemingly light - hearted and sweat natured that it managed to captivate many viewers who would not normally appreciate a French - language film ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","Others however have found it somewhat alienating , with a small fraction seeming highly critical of the unashamed romanticism and moments of fantastical abstraction ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","However , to view Amelie ( 2001 ) as a simple frothy farce - a modern day fairy - story with a contemporary edge - is missing the point somewhat ; neglecting the darker moments of the narrative and the prevailing feeling of alienation and melancholy that punctuates many of the more rose - tinted scenes ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","If we question the use of style here , it becomes apparent that there are two singular interpretations that you can take in enjoying this film ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","The first is the most simple and immediate ; the idea of an abstract fantasy , that envelopes the characters and presents the power of true love and imagination in all its colourful glory ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
",The second interpretation is somewhat more difficult ; the idea that the more imaginative elements are symptomatic of the loneliness and intense sadness felt by the central character as she attempts to navigate herself through life .
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","By extension , the way we approach the film depends very much on the way we approach the central character , whose attempts at goodwill and the process of shaping the course of life to suit her own thoughts and feelings will either seem charming and playful , or obsessive and unhinged ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","When I first saw the film I took it at face value ; I suppose , largely as a result of how different it was to the films that Jeunet had previously made with Marc Caro ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","However , after half a decade of watching and re - watching , it becomes incredibly clear that Amelie is a darker film than many would care to admit ; one that features suicide , illness , the death of Princess Diana , loneliness , ennui , obsession and a brief depiction of the sex industry , distorted and abstracted by an incredibly child - like perspective ."
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","You don""t have to see it on such a level - with the immediate interpretation being just as much fun -"
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","but you can""t help but think that the scene in which Amelie sits on the roof of her building and fantasises about the sexual - climaxes of almost every single couple in Paris is somewhat uncomfortable , especially since the character is supposedly twenty - two ,"
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","and not fifteen ! Likewise , the central character sees her own mother commit suicide , another character is bullied as a child ,"
ThreeSadTigers,Null,0,2,12 May 2008," Contrary to the general consensus; a melancholic and often disheartening film
","and then , of course , we have that other central character whose disability has made it impossible for him to leave the house for the vast majority of his adult life ."

","For me , the film was more of a tear - jerker than something that made me leave the theatre with a warm smile on my face ; with the melancholic music of Yann Tiersen - with its accordions , horns , strings and toy - pianos - perfectly capturing the essence of this character trapped between childhood and adult life , and left alienated as a result ."

","With this in mind , Amelie reminded me of Jean Luc Godard""s first masterpiece Une femme est une femme ( 1961 ) , with the colourful use of mise - en - scene , costumes and production design - not to mention the subtle juxtaposition of iconography and genre references - all creating a mood and a tone that works towards disguising the more sad and tragic elements of both the character and the film ."

",With an incredible pace Jean - Pierre Jeunet creates a completely unique atmosphere where he plays with luck and predestination .

",This starts with the conception of Amelie

",and goes on with important events / traumas in the life of a child .

",The editing and camera - work are key elements to this .

",In the second part Amelie lives alone in Paris .
diand_,8,0,2,1 August 2005," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
","The house and the many characters inhabiting it is reminiscent of "" Delicatessen "" , except for the dark undertone which is replaced by a more gentler , realistic ( although still somewhat surreal ) portrayal of Paris residents ."

","In this segment the drama factor plays up , especially when Amelie exposes us to the loneliness of the big city dwellers ."

","Also the game of luck and destiny is reversed : events don""t just happen to her"

",Overall the movie has an air of nostalgia all over it .
diand_,8,0,2,1 August 2005," Chance and destiny in an ingeniously created universe
",It is a highly romantic movie in the proper context of romanticism ( one aspect being that products of the popular imagination could equal or even surpass those of the educated ; Jeunet being a far more popular and successful filmmaker than the big names of the French nouvelle vague nowadays is a nice parallel here ) .

","The second complaint involves apparent racism in the film , for while its Paris may be part fantasy , why are ethnic groups left out to such an extent ( the real Paris like all huge cities is a melting pot of cultures ) ? Honestly , this never ever occured to me while watching the film ."
