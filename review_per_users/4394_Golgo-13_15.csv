The Blair Witch Project," Great horror.
","I watched The Blair Witch Project again (and the commentary and extras). Was it still a good movie, was it still scary? Absolutely. The characters were strong and realistic and showed real emotions, the setting was perfect and fully used, and the use of sound was awesome. All that made for an incredible atmosphere. At only 77 minutes, the movie moved along at a brisk pace. The shaky footage wasn't that bad at all and some of the shots of the woods are just great. I will admit that some of the power of the film has somewhat diminished over the years (and from watching it at least four times!) but the same can be said of most any scary horror flick. The ending still gave me chills for a good fifteen seconds though. I even rewound it to check something and it creeped me out a second time! BWP is not conventional horror and that's one of the reasons it works so well (but maybe that's the problem for some people too?)it's different, unique. The presentation, backed up with the mythos, is what really makes this movie something special. I've never seen another quite like it. The DVD commentary is decent and goes over the making of the film. The makers discussed the great ideas and techniques used to make the film as realistic as possible. The three trailers were pretty cool toono wonder it was a box-office hit. I also watched Curse of the Blair Witch and Stick and Stones. Sticks and Stones is basically the same as CotBW, only it's edited a bit quicker. These documentaries are informative and compelling and help set up the mood for BWP but I didn't find them particularly scary. All in all, though, I really had a good time revisiting this whole cinematic experience.",10,2,4,2 September 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A definitive film of action and adventure.
","From the heavily booby-trapped South American temple to the violent gun fight in Marion's bar, from the confusing chase through the streets of Cairo to the painful fist fight with the Nazi strongman, from the exciting horse/car/truck/motorcycle chase to get control of the Ark to the Mexican stand-off with a rocket launcher to the final confrontation between good and evil, Raiders seems to have it all. It blends action and adventure with comedy, drama, romance, and horror seamlessly. The hero, Indiana Jones, is a man's man. Tough and rugged, he keeps going no matter what the odds, be it countless opposition or catching a ride on a sub or even (gasp!) facing hundreds of deadly snakes. The directing, acting, script, and story are all right on target. The theme is one of the most memorable in film history. All this and more make Raiders a timeless classic!",10,2,4,5 January 2006
Oldboy," One of the best films I watched in 2004.
","Oldboy, a Korean action thriller, is one of the best films I watched in 2004! Oh Daesu, on his way home to celebrate his daughter's birthday, finds himself kidnapped and placed in a small apartment-like room. Despite his attempts to find out why, he is never told anything over the 15 years he remains prisoner there! During the time in his cell, he stays busy by attempting suicide, watching TV, trying to escape, and preparing for when he does get out. It is at that time Oh Daesu will begin his violent, disturbing quest for answers. No more needs to be said, as this is a film best left revealed as you watch it for the first time. I will mention one scene for the action fans though. Oh Daesu, on his way out of a building, starts into a hall and encounters a whole gang of punks prepared to stop him. Armed with a mere claw hammer, our hero smashes his way to the other end, realistically dishing out pain (and taking his share of it back!). We witness this awesome scene of action beauty unfold over the course of about three minutes, scrolling from the left to the right, and with absolutely no cuts! Anyway, with its unique and suspenseful plot, great characters and acting, and sharp sense of style and music, Oldboy was an impressive feature. The film was less than a year old and a remake was already in the works! If you get the chance, I definitely recommend watching it. I'm looking forward to now checking out director Chan-wook Park's earlier film, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance.Comment originally submitted on September 5, 2005.",8,4,8,9 December 2008
Constantine," This one came across a little better with a second viewing.
","Keanu Reeves is back in action! (cricket, cricket) He's lost his soul (anyone surprised?) for attempting suicide and now seeks to regain God's favor by banishing demons back to Hell and protecting earth. Satan has some plans of his own though, as does the angel Gabriel. Interesting material but I think the movie failed to really capitalize on it. The scenes of Hell didn't impress me much, just a city in flames. The movie didn't really seem to have a climax either, unless you consider Satan in a white suit acting silly and making jokes one. Still, the movie moved along nicely and gave my mind a rest. And yes, I know a cricket is an insect and not a sound.This one came across a little better with a second viewing. A little, mind you, which is to say it adequately passed the time. Constantine's golden, cross gun is absurd though. And I don't know how he managed to trick Satan at the end. But, that's what you get with this kind of flick.",5,0,3,2 September 2005
The Passion of Joan of Arc," ...and hope and faith...
","This silent masterpiece, based off historical records, reveals the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. It was wonderfully acted, with Maria Falconetti giving a particularly moving performance as the lead. And director Carl Theodor Dreyer really captures the detailed expressions and emotions of all the actors through a constant use of close-ups, which also added to the sense of distress and torment, and hope and faith, this picture intended to convey. The film is also quite stylish, with sharp editing, reverse camera angles, quick montages, and multiple instances of symbolism. Set design, or at least what was shown of it, was sparse but believably so, and gave several nods to German expressionism. The Criterion DVD does justice to this once lost work of art, giving us the option to watch it completely silent or with the Voices of Light soundtrack, an operatic orchestration inspired by the film, which I found to be very fitting. Also included on the disc is a comprehensive commentary track, a feature on the history and many versions of the film, and several other worthwhile extras. All in all, this is the best silent film I've seen and I'm glad I went ahead and purchased it.",10,2,4,7 February 2006
The Aviator," I get mad when people touch my peas toodisturbingly mad.
","In my opinion, out of the nominated films for best picture, The Aviator is the movie that should have won, along with Scorsese as director. The story of Howard Hughes is a fascinating one; on one hand, a forward-thinker and genius of aviation (among many, many other things) and on the other, a man crippled by obsessive-compulsive disorder. Leonardo DiCaprio is excellent as the lead and the movie (focusing more on Hughes' younger years) is an amazing, enjoyable watch from start to finish. Nice work with the CGI too. The commentary is decent, as are the other DVD extras. If you want to learn more about Hughes, the History Channel documentary on disc two is the thing to watch.",9,1,2,2 September 2005
American Psycho," American Nightmare?
","I'm not sure I fully go for the whole 'yuppie-to-psycho' theme (maybe as a stretched-out satire, which was probably the intent) but I definitely find the movie pretty entertaining. Christian Bale is perfect as the psychotic Patrick Bateman and the film is filled to the brim with black humor, especially with some of the Patrick's inner monologues. The business card scene was just great! I skipped through the two commentaries and both seemed to be decent but I didn't really care for the featurettes much. They supplied some good information but something, maybe the presentation, maybe the people, just didn't work for me. Oh well, it was still a cool horror flick.",7,0,2,2 September 2005
Legends of the Fall," Zwick's style of sap.
","Edward Zwick's epic tale of frontier life is not a bad movie. Sappy, yes, at times but bad? Nope. In fact, I can actually enjoy and appreciate Zwick's style of sapit has sort of a nostalgic feel to it. The story spans many years and seems to hone in on Brad Pitt's character; I guess because he was the most 'true' human of them all. The action, consisting of some battle scenes, knife and gun fights, and bear attacks, is fairly good and the acting is more than adequate all around. On the Special Edition DVD there are three deleted scenes, one of which is very similar to a scene in Zwick's The Last Samurai. It's the scene involving a person who is a bit too curious about the details of scalping.",7,1,3,22 April 2006
Batman Begins," Not as cool as Burton's Batman.
","Bam! Pow! Kazam! Batman Begins (currently at 117 on the IMDb 250!?). OK, there were several elements I really liked. Bruce Wayne's training in the first 45 minutes was pretty cool, as were the deeper than usual themes of justice and revenge. The way Wayne acquired Batman's wonderful toys was explained nicely too, such as having the two ears manufactured at a different place than the actual mask to avoid suspicion. The movie was suitably dark and Christian Bale was more than acceptable as the lead. That all said, the movie seemed overlong at two plus hours, perhaps being the cause of the frenzied-to-a-fault climax. The last half hour was a mix of rushed details and plot points, resulting in a nearly awful watch. The fighting and action itself was nothing great either, often consisting of quick edits and the camera being so close as to lose focus of what is actually going on. All in all, a decent movie but Burton's version still reigns supreme in my book. Oh yeah, the suped-up, armored dune buggy didn't really work for me as a Batmobile either, nor did the 'look' of Gotham.",6,0,1,2 September 2005
City of God," THAT great?
","Over the course of 25 years or so, we are told the (true?) story of several poor youths who grow up in the slums of Brazil, leading to a life of violence, drugs, and organized crime. The focus, though, is usually on Buscapé, a young man who chooses not to dive head first into the grime but to simply try and work his way through it. He also has a penchant for photography, which is just the ticket he needs. City of God is similar, both in style and content, to the likes of Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas. Trendy camera-work, (semi-)hip dialogue and humor, shocking, brutal violence, and a mob-like plot line are all aspects of it and actually done decently. The scene in which a boy must choose to be shot either in his hand or foot is a favorite! That all said, there was something about this movie that I did not like and I can't put my finger on itI just didn't leave the theater thinking it was THAT great. And a ranking of 16 (48 when I wrote this review back in February of 2004) on IMDb? I just don't see that. It wasn't a bad movie though.",6,6,15,22 April 2006
School of Rock," Jack Black and his brand of humor.
","Over the past few years, I've come to enjoy Jack Black and his brand of humor. In School of Rock, he plays a rock'n'roll-obsessed guitarist in an amateur band that is about to compete in a 'Battle of the Bands' contest. When the other members kick him out because of his antics, he takes his friend's job (behind his back) as substitute teacher of a grade school class for some easy cash. As he soon finds out, these kids have musical talent and a plan formshe has a band again! This fun, light-hearted flick was pretty enjoyable and had plenty of references to classic rock, which rocks. While Black stole the show, the kids were actually playing the instruments and they're pretty good. The DVD has commentary from the kids, which was just OK, and from Black and director Linklater, which was funny at times. The best feature on the DVD is Black's short video to Led Zeppelin, begging for permission to use their Immigrant Song!",7,0,0,22 April 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," What a mind-blowing experience!
","This is one of the best, if not the best, science fiction movies I've seen. The film is long and very slow but I was never tempted to hit fast-forward. The actual story isn't too complex but it is compelling and deep and will leave you thinking about it for some time afterwards. The mysterious Monoliths, the 'infallible' HAL-9000, hyper-travel through a wormhole, etcthese are just a few of the memorable things in 2001. And then there's the special effects; in a word, groundbreaking. Seriously, this stuff (from 1968!) wouldn't look out of place even in something as modern as Episode III. And to top it all off, you have Kubrick's incredibly effective use of music, sound effects,and silence. Yep, this is one haunting masterpiece of the sci-fi genre and should not be missed.",10,1,5,21 April 2006
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," What a title.
","Charlie Kaufman, seemingly one of today's hottest screenwriters, serves up another strangely cerebral concept with Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. If you're a fan of the guy's work, you'll probably find this one a delightful treat too. What really struck me was the emotional relationship between the characters portrayed by Jim Carrey and Kate Winsletit was at least believable, if not realistic. But I guess that's sort of the point of the movie, an exploration of personal relationships (through a weird, scifi-like journey of the mind). In the end though, while I did enjoy the movie, at 32 on the IMDb 250, I think it's highly overrated.",5,1,3,2 September 2005
War of the Worlds," Skirmish of the Worlds.
","Intense theme, huge CGI effects, but the movie just felt empty on the whole. Maybe it was the fact that the running story followed a tired, typical family group and never really had any other focus. Maybe the said story moves along a bit too quickly, leaving some holes behind. Who knows? Still, as a summer movie, it makes with the eye-candy and provides us with some astonishing scenes of hostile alien chaos. Tom Cruise was pretty much his normal self but I'm sort of getting tired of seeing Dakota Fanning, what with her ringed, droopy eyes. Tim Robbins makes an appearance too, in a role that doesn't seem to suit him. Ah, what can you do?",6,0,1,2 September 2005
1408," Excessive, and dull.
","It seems to be an appreciated film around here but I really didn't care for it myself. Aside from it being your very typical Hollywood horror production, I just wasn't able to buy into any of it, from the unconvincing (as usual) supernatural psychological occurrences to the over-the-top yet generic CGI room variations. The film lacks any notion of subtlety and is, in fact, quite excessive with its visual hauntings. It all becomes just so tedious and dull. Don't look to the plot for any help either, as sentimental pap is placed above suspenseful mystery here. On top of all this is John Cusack's 'deer-in-the-headlights' performance. Looking back, I guess I kinda hated the movie, actually.",3,2,3,5 June 2015
