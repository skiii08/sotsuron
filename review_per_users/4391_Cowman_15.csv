Requiem for a Dream," Brutal and relentless anti-drug film.
","A bleak and disturbing tale of four individuals whose lives are ruined by drug addictions.  The actors all do an outstanding job, especially Ellen Burstyn playing the pill-popping mother of heroin addict Jared Leto.  The stunning visuals and fast-paced editing were superb as well, and the haunting original score by Clint Mansell helps to provide the movie with a suitably eerie atmosphere.  Even though the film itself seems a bit empty and overdone when examined closely, you will be too engrossed in the film's disquieting trance to even notice.",Null,0,0,20 June 2001
The Ring," R.I.N.G. -- Remade Into Nauseating Garbage. Another perfect example of how to Americanize (aka ruin) flawless Japanese cinema.
","Being a huge fan of the original RINGU series, I was eagerly awaiting this American remake for several months.  Don't get me wrong, I was wary at first, but as the release date grew nearer and the trailers and positive reviews started pouring in, I became more and more anxious to see it.  I walked into my local bug-infested, foul-smelling cinema with high hopes. Plopping myself into a sticky, soda-encrusted seat, I began feeling a sense of overbearing excitement as I impatiently waited for the godawful previews to end and the lights to dim.  However, ten minutes into the movie, I knew exactly what I was in for: a dull, formulated, vastly overhyped letdown. As the film trudged to an overlong, disappointing conclusion I was constantly reminded of a little promise I had made myself after seeing NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (1990), PSYCHO (1998), and OCEAN'S ELEVEN (2001): under no circumstances will I ever watch another remake again, especially those remakes whose originals are completely faultless in and of themselves, and couldn't possibly be effectively updated and/or improved in any way without detracting from the superiority of the original.  How I wish I could keep my own promises!In the 1998 masterpiece, a distinct feeling of dread and uneasiness was constantly present, slowly but tensely building into an unexpected and downright terrifying climax.  The mood it created was absolutely haunting and so carefully executed that it stuck with you long after the credits rolled.  It didn't need to rely on big-budget special effects and continuous loud, cheaply startling jump-cuts.   Unfortunately, that's all THE RING has going for it.  It doesn't even try to tap into the nail-biting atmosphere of the original.  Sadly, with the permeation of trashy stalk-'n-slash gorefests during the 80s and trendy, pop-horror SCREAM clones during the 90s, it's safe to say that modern American horror has dug itself into an inescapable rut of thoughtlessness, unoriginality, and an embarrassing dependency on attractive characters (who, might I add, are usually half-dressed or nude at some point, if not most, of the movie) and gross visuals.  THE RING is no different.  It is typical, contrived, and pretentious to the nth degree.The lackluster remake also strips RINGU bare of its enigmatic nature, spending way too much time trying to explain everything.  There is nothing left to the imagination.  Everything is spelled out for us, right up to the trite, tacked-on ending.  In RINGU, the viewer is left to draw his or her own conclusions, but not here.  Everything is wrapped up nice and neatly. God forbid we have to think!THE RING just couldn't seem to get anything right, not even the movie within the movie.  The videotape in RINGU contained about 30 seconds of grainy, abstract, and unsettling images.  After it is played for the viewer, you feel as if you are now part of the curse.  In THE RING, it is stretched out into a lengthy, laughable mishmash of arbitrary nonsense.  RINGU's tape worked because it was brief and of extremely low quality, making appear as if VHS is far too new a medium for its content.  This also succeeds in adding a great deal of ambiguity to the tape's origin.  Upon seeing the video playback in THE RING, you'll find that it's just the opposite: long and overproduced, complete with sharp color, fluid motion, needless gross-outs, and even computer-generated images.  Give me a break!  Noah's braindead character chalked it up accurately when he mumbled 'it's very student film', except for the fact that many student films are actually way more interesting.Although I was deeply disappointed in this movie, I realize now that I shouldn't have been so eager to believe that it had even a smidgen of potential.  After all, what on earth could I have been expecting from the writer and the director of such insipid, braindead pictures like 'Scream 3' and 'Mouse Hunt'?  Shame on me.Next time you're standing at the box office, contemplating which overpriced movie ticket to spend your hard-earned cash on, take my word and pass on THE RING.  At least wait about two or three weeks when the general public realizes it sucks and it ends up at the $1 theater.  Or better yet, order yourself a copy of RINGU instead.",Null,6,11,21 October 2002
Citizen Kane," CITIZEN KANE may let some people down, but it's still worth seeing.
","It's a difficult undertaking for someone of my generation to watch a film like CITIZEN KANE.  Not because it's 'too old' or 'too boring', but because it has been hailed--almost universally--as the single best motion picture ever made.  And while the anticipation of seeing a film with such overwhelming acclaim may be quite exhilarating, actually watching it is ultimately an intimidating and somewhat disappointing experience.This isn't to say that I thought CITIZEN KANE was a bad film; in fact, I thought everything about it was downright brilliant.  From the enchanting performances right down to the meticulously planned camera movements and clever lighting tricks, there isn't a single element of CITIZEN KANE that isn't a stunning achievement in all areas of filmmaking.CITIZEN KANE's storyline is deceptively simple.  Even though the plot unfolds by jumping in and out of nonlinear flashbacks, it is surprisingly easy to keep track of.  The straightforwardness and relatively fast pace of the story are what make it seem intimidating.  Because everything moves smoothly along without any standstill, it feels like we are being fooled-like there is something much greater that we just can't seem to grasp.  As a first-time viewer, I knew from its reputation that there must be *something* that separates this movie from all the others; something buried within its simple plotline that everybody else has seen, but that I just could not seem to get a handle on.  And then, during those final frames, that something was revealed, and it all began to make sense.  To me, it was these moments of confusion and uncertainty followed by a sense of enlightenment and appreciation that made watching CITIZEN KANE such a meaningful experience.But no matter how great of a movie CITIZEN KANE really is, it can never live up to one's expectations.  Although I do feel that it is deserving of its acclamation, the constant exposure to its six decades worth of hype and praise will invariably set most modern viewers' standards at a height that is virtually unreachable--even if it really *is* the best movie of all time.",Null,712,948,2 May 2004
The Birth of a Nation," Easy to appreciate; hard to sit through.
","For the most part, I found D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION to be an amazing picture. Even by the strict standards of Hollywood epics today, almost everything about this film was truly remarkable-especially when considering all of the technological limitations of the time. It's hard to believe that this was the first feature-length motion picture ever made, because Griffith really has the style down to a tee. It seems like learning how to shoot and edit such a long, well-flowing story would be a skill that would take several films to master, but it looks as if Griffith virtually perfected the craft on his very first try.Despite BIRTH's long running time, the film rolls swiftly by without missing a beat. The plot was surprisingly complex, beginning with a touching portrait of the friendship of two very different families, and soon branching off into several thematic subplots involving romance, war, despair, bigotry, and honor. Given the intricacy of the story, I was impressed at how clearly and concisely it played out, especially after reminding myself that film has never been used to tell such a grand story before.All praise aside, however, there were some areas of THE BIRTH OF A NATION that I found to be utterly appalling. Namely, the heroic depiction of the Ku Klux Klan and the portrayal of blacks as vicious, easily led savages made my stomach turn. The disclaimer at the beginning of the picture claims that Griffith's intent was not to be racist, but merely historically accurate. Needless to say, this is wrong on both counts: not only is THE BIRTH OF A NATION a disgustingly and overtly racist picture through and through, but a great deal of the so-called facts regarding the Civil War are either grossly skewed in favor of the Griffith's conservative Southern mentality, or they are just plain made up. Though this movie is most definitely a groundbreaking achievement in film-making, it most certainly isn't a likable one.To me, watching THE BIRTH OF A NATION was a worthwhile experience for historical purposes, and it really is easy to appreciate the tremendous effort that went into making it. But even so, I found it difficult to actually enjoy such a blatantly racially prejudiced movie.",Null,2,5,19 February 2004
Superbad," Superbland
","If Kevin Smith tried to write a teen sex comedy, the rough draft might look something like this movie. Luckily for us, Smith left the tired genre alone. And so, here we are in 2008, and along comes Superbad.We've seen Fast Times at Ridgemont High.We've seen Porky's.We've seen American Pie.We've seen the thousands of other movies that have adopted this formula (annoying teenagers trying to get laid + alcohol = hijinks).So where else is there to go with this kind of a movie? Nowhere. A teen sex comedy is a teen sex comedy, period. This movie goes way too far in its desperate attempts to sway the viewer into thinking it's something deeper. It isn't. It's a parade of unlikable teenagers on a quest for booze and sex with a nice little moral at the end to make us feel like we weren't wasting our time. At least the aforementioned movies didn't kid themselves about their intent.This isn't a terrible movie, but it's certainly not very good. There are a few genuine laughs along the way. But its silly little 'social commentary' and its insistence on developing empty, one-dimensional characters are nothing short of pitiful.Don't believe the hype.",Null,1,3,19 October 2008
Alien," ALIEN is undeniably terrifying, but still suffers from a few flaws
","Ridley Scott's ALIEN is an immensely terrifying film. But the terror that it instills within the audience is of a kind that is sadly unknown to most viewers today. These days, what passes as 'horror' is a mishmash of hyperactive editing, cheap scares, bad rock music, and explicit death scenes. ALIEN is the antithesis of all that.ALIEN is a classic exercise in substance over style. Granted, it *is* a remarkably stylish film. It's hard not to notice the flashy visuals, the exhaustingly intricate production design, and the terrifying creature effects. But what's unique about ALIEN is that it never actually depends on any these elements to scare the viewer. It's already a frightening movie at its core; it just uses these elements to enhance the scares and add more believability to the story. Whereas most other big-budgeted horror titles rely solely on their special effects and lavish production values to frighten the viewer, ALIEN doesn't have to--its enthralling storyline, crafty camera-work, and masterful direction are effective enough on their own.What makes the horror of ALIEN so successful is that it sets up a feeling of anxiety and dread in the very beginning, and continues to slowly and gradually pile on the tension until the explosive climax. There are long, lingering shots where nothing seems to happen and characters don't communicate with one another--yet, the amount of tension in these scenes is unbearable. You *know* something just isn't right. The film creeps along rather slowly, even after the alien life form is discovered and makes its way aboard the ship. The entire time, you're expecting the worst; and yet, oddly, you never see it coming.After twenty-five years, ALIEN still succeeds in being an exceptionally nerveracking picture. But there are a handful of areas that appear dated or otherwise out of place. Most obviously, the 'futuristic' computers and electronics onboard Nostromo are clunky and primitive--almost laughably so. But since personal computers were still in their infancy during the time of production, an issue such as this is easy to overlook. What's puzzling, though, is the discontinuity regarding the special effects. In most of the SFX-intensive sequences, the effects are carried out with striking realism, even by today's standards. But in other scenes, the creature appears to be nothing more than a rubbery hand-puppet, or in a couple instances, a guy ambling around in an alien costume. There's also a startling jump-cut that substitutes a prosthetic head for the actor's real head that is more distracting than effectual. While none of these unbefitting visuals ever actually detract from the quality of the film, one must wonder why these few instances of special effects artistry are so mediocre while the rest are nothing short of amazing.Parts of the plot were hackneyed and predictable, particularly the false scare involving the cat and the entire subplot about science officer Ash being a robot bent on destroying the crew and transporting the murderous alien to Earth for the United States government. I found this part of the story to be totally forced and completely unnecessary, even detracting somewhat from the perfect simplicity of the plot up to this point (although it did make for some interesting anti-governmental themes). And I'm all for on screen titillation, but were those prolonged Sigourney Weaver underwear shots really necessary? Still, despite these minor gripes, I still consider ALIEN to be among the greatest and most well-made sci-fi/horror films I have ever experienced--not to mention one of the scariest!",Null,0,1,21 March 2006
Moulin Rouge!," Loaded with forgettable performances and unnervingly appalling medleys!
","Jumbled, overrated tale of a budding writer named Christian who leaves home and lives among 'the children of the revolution', a diverse group of animated young romantics, in order to turn his literature into a successful career.  In no time at all, Christian becomes involved in the performing arts at the seedy burlesque house/dance hall Moulin Rouge, and soon falls madly in love with the club's leading lady.  The concept of a musical with an anachronistic soundtrack seemed interesting, but the choice of songs coupled with their unintentionally comic delivery completely ruined what might have been an otherwise effective movie.  The editing was also tremendously disorganized, and as a result the film's mood seemed to constantly switch from surreal to real and back to surreal again.  Lastly, this movie was far too long for its own good.  Its style becomes overwhelmingly tiring long before the two hours are up.  On the plus side, however, the set decoration and costumes were fantastic.",Null,0,1,1 August 2001
The Evil Dead," An Undisputed Horror Classic
","Five chums vacate to an old abandoned cottage, only to wind up inadvertently summoning some nasty demon spirits who have a tendency to possess the lads. Mind-blowing special effects and stunning cinematography highlight this cult classic, especially considering its meager $50k budget.  Writer/director Sam Raimi really shows off his talent here, effectively combining gut-wrenching terror with stomach-churning gore to create a certain feeling of uneasiness in the viewer.  And even though the actors tend to overdo it a bit (a quality which actually adds to the creepiness of the demons, but detracts from the movie as a whole) and some sequences are just a bit drawn out, anyone who appreciates a good scare will no doubt dig this film.",Null,0,1,31 August 2001
"Girl, Interrupted"," This film suffers from borderline good-movie disorder.
","Nicely told yet unimpressive tale of Susanna, an 18-year-old who adapts to a new life in an all-girl mental institution after attempting suicide via aspirin/vodka ('I had a headache!').  Angelina Jolie plays Lisa Rowe, the asylum's most infamous bigshot patient, and soon both her and the main character (Ryder) scheme to escape from the confines of the hospital. Although they are great actresses, far too much screen time was given to Ryder and Jolie.  So much so, that when something happens to the secondary characters we don't know enough about them to really care.  This was an OK film, but the book was probably much better.

","'There's Something About Mary' is a surprisingly good, funny film that is perfect for anybody with an open mind.

A Clockwork Orange," A thoughtful and stylish film, although deeply troubling.
","Filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was no stranger to controversy.  Even though most of his efforts were highly praised by critics everywhere, films like PATHS OF GLORY, LOLITA, and DR. STRANGELOVE rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. The same can be said about his 1971 film, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, which received huge critical acclaim despite the fact that it is without a doubt the most notorious title in his filmography.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is indeed an excellent picture, but it's not hard to see why it has earned such a sordid reputation.Watching A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is like immersing yourself in a barbaric, futuristic nightmare.  The cops are corrupt, the government is increasingly intrusive, and the kids are getting their jollies from raping, robbing, and rumbling.  In other words, it's just like today--only much more surreal.Kubrick's vision of a violent, sadistic future is uniquely disturbing. Rather than showing the chaotic, digitized, robotized, post- or near-apocalyptic future that we're all used to seeing in other sci-fi movies, Kubrick opts for a colorful, vibrant, and unfittingly serene landscape.  The interiors are darkly lit and uncomfortably roomy, the furniture is gaudy and abstract, and the architecture is almost Escher-like in its complexity.  This sort of `neo-apocalyptic' setting is most likely what makes the film all the more alarming, since we as viewers are not accustomed to seeing such primitive acts of violence and barbarism atop a vibrant, modern-art backdrop.  Even the graphically violent scenes are orchestrated in an upbeat and dance-like fashion, such as the scene wherein Alex and his droogs sexually assault a woman to the tune of 'Singin' in the Rain'.The messages in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE are equally troubling.  The film clearly stresses the importance of the human right to a free will, but it also makes clear the problems that come along with such a right--namely, that given the choice, many people will choose to be hateful and vicious, simply because they can be.  A CLOCKWORK ORANGE also seems to suggest that there is no hope for dangerous individuals such as Alex; that those who lack a conscience now will lack a conscience forever, regardless of what happens to them--a troubling message indeed.Though much of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is overtly shocking, it is still a relatively humble film.  It is evident that Kubrick had a lot to say with this movie, but rather than deliberately blurt his ideas at the viewer to get his point across, he wisely chose to implement the tiniest of subtleties in order to convey his messages.  This is what makes A CLOCKWORK ORANGE stay fresh and interesting, even with repeat viewings.  It is one of those films where no matter how many times one sees it, he will always pick up on something new.",Null,1,2,6 May 2004
Halloween," It's good, but is it really THAT good?
","HALLOWEEN, the infamous stalk 'n slash flick about an escaped lunatic bent on brutally murdering random teenagers, has often been hailed as the 'scariest movie of all time'.  It has been compared to (and sometimes even held above) PSYCHO, THE EXORCIST, and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  It was, until recently, the most successful, most profitable independent movie in cinema history.  It helped launch the careers of several young, struggling actors and filmmakers.  And as of 2002, it has spawned seven big-budget sequels.Okay, so we've established the fact that John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN has received a lot of attention and critical acclaim.  But honestly, is it really deserving of all of this praise?  Was it really worth all the hype surrounding it?  As a devout fan of not only horror movies, but of the art of filmmaking in general, I'm going to have to say no.I strongly feel that HALLOWEEN, although stylish, horrifying, and generally well-made, should not be ranked among such classics as PSYCHO, T.C.M., or ROSEMARY'S BABY.  These films were far ahead of their time and broke new ground. HALLOWEEN, despite singlehandedly popularizing the slasher subgenre, was really nothing new, even for 1978.  Why didn't films like A BAY OF BLOOD (1971), I DISMEMBER MAMA (1974), ALICE SWEET ALICE (1976), or SUSPIRIA (1977) get this much credit?  They all had a formula similar to that of HALLOWEEN's, and in many ways, they were much better*...And they were made just a few years before!Even in Italy, birthplace of some of horror's most talented filmmakers (Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Ruggero Deodato, Lucio Fulci, etc.), HALLOWEEN is still considered a cult classic!  You'd think that a country that has been responsible for some of the most horrifying motion pictures ever made would've seen the fad for what it was, and not have given in.  But I suppose trends like these are often international, especially when they originate from a nation as influential as the United States.  Again, keep in mind that I'm not trying to say that HALLOWEEN is a bad movie; only that it has been done many times before 1978--and better.* This particular comment does not apply to 'I DISMEMBER MAMA', which --ahem-- is not really what I'd consider a 'good movie'.",4,0,0,2 November 2002
Signs," Finally, a movie that deserves all the hype it's getting!
","I must admit: I went to see this movie with a closed mind.  My sister, who seems to like virtually every movie ever made, had told me how 'bad' this movie was, so I was very reluctant to see it.  After all, if she thought 'Dude, Where's My Car?' was groundbreaking entertainment, then this must be REALLY bad.I was pleasantly surprised, however.  SIGNS turned out to be the best movie I have seen so far this year.  The story itself was very compelling and thought-provoking, and the ending was cleverly executed and succeeded in bringing satisfying closure.  Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix, and M. Night Shyamalan (who also wrote, directed, and produced) all played their parts exceptionally well, helping to sustain the film's eerie atmosphere and ultra-thick tension.If there's one movie you see this year, make it SIGNS.  You'll be on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to sleep for at least a week.",Null,1,3,23 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A breathtakingly beautiful, utterly perfect film
","Peter Jackson has achieved the impossible with the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. He has crafted a motion picture that is not only technically perfect, but visually mind-blowing and immensely entertaining in every respect. And what's more, Jackson has not only accomplished this feat once, but three times in a row! THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and THE TWO TOWERS were exciting, breathtakingly beautiful motion pictures, and THE RETURN OF THE KING is no different. Like its predecessors, RETURN is rich with dazzling special effects; a haunting, melodic score; and hundreds of amazingly well-choreographed battle sequencesall set against the stunning backdrop of rural New Zealand.The series flows seamlessly from one film to the next, yet each film stands on its own as a unique, original work of cinematic art. In THE RETURN OF THE KING, Frodo and Sam carry on their trek to Mount Doom to dispose of the One Ring, while a seemingly endless war for the future of Middle Earth rages on around them. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli all venture to the Cursed Mountains to seek assistance from the lost souls who forever dwell there; as the beautiful elfin queen Arwen is torn between her father's wishes of joining her people for eternal life and her own desire to sacrifice her immortality in order to be with Aragorn.There's a lot going on in the LORD OF THE RINGS films, and unless you're already familiar with the story (I wasn't), it can be difficult to keep track of the many characters and subplots. Broken down, the LORD OF THE RINGS storyline is nothing more than a good-versus-evil tale, albeit a complex, multilayered one. The pacing is suitably evenhanded, allotting equal amounts of screen time to the various colorful characters and journeys taking place within Middle Earth. THE RETURN OF THE KING never once falls into the trap of showing too much or too little of a certain subplot, and it never progresses too far without providing ample information about what is taking place elsewhere.Though I was impressed with virtually every facet of the RINGS trilogy, what strikes me most about these films is Jackson's astounding attention to detail. Every shot is impeccably executed, right down to the last frame. The set design, costumes, weaponry, and even the traits and mannerisms of the different races of characters are perfectly and meticulously conceived. The amount of time and dedication invested into these films is truly unfathomablejust take a look at the credits! The computer-generated characters are some of the most impressive I have ever seen, particularly the subtle movements and detailed facial expressions of Gollum. However, the CG creatures still lack the naturalism of organic movement, and at times their interaction with human characters seems too obviously staged. There's a certain fluid, overly smooth quality of their movement that makes it seem artificial. We certainly have come a long way in the field of computer animation, but we still have quite a ways to go to combine it with live action and make it seem completely believable. This is not to say that the CG in LORD OF THE RINGS isn't great, just that it's not perfect. Still, it's probably as close to perfection as is humanly possible at this point.THE RETURN OF THE KING swept the Academy Awards in 2004, raking in a well-deserved, unprecedented eleven Oscars. Not bad for a guy whose first foray into feature film-making was a low-budget gorefest about flesh-eating aliens!",Null,2,4,6 April 2006
Cube," Great concept is muddled by too many glaring flaws
","The premise of CUBE is an interesting, highly original one: six complete strangers awaken in a cubical maze/prison with absolutely no recollection of how they got there. Each of the characters has his or her own unique talent, which helps the party in their quest to escape, avoid the maze's deadly traps, and find answers as to why they were captured and imprisoned. It sounds awesome, and the film's trailer is certainly intriguing, but you may be disappointed.CUBE's major fault is the overdone, unbelievable character development. Everyone in this movie seems to have bipolar disorder, as they all turn from friendly to hostile (or, in one particular case, downright evil), then back again without question. Even for a situation this serious, there's far too many unrealistic emotional loops for the movie's span of 1-2 days. Also, why doesn't anybody complain about being hungry or thirsty?Another area where the film falls flat has to do with its inconsistencies involving mathematics. CUBE relies heavily on math by assigning numbers to each of the rooms, which supposedly represent their coordinates on a three-dimensional grid. Leaven, this math-whiz character (who does virtually all of the work in the movie), can quickly and easily decipher their position, a process which is theoretically a long, draining, and frustrating one. Sure, she may be a math whiz, but then why did she have such a hard time determining if three-digit numbers were prime back towards the beginning of the film? She concentrates for several seconds on numbers that are very obviously not prime, such as even numbers and numbers that are multiples of five. Many people who have absolutely no mathematical talent whatsoever (take me, for example) are able remember these sixth-grade rules.Later on in the movie, she dismisses certain complex math problems as being impossible to figure out mentally due to the numbers being astronomical. Mind you, these are the exact same types of problems that she had no trouble solving earlier.Another gripe I had with CUBE is that it can't make up its mind whether it wants to be realistic or surreal. It's okay to blend the two to a certain degree, but this movie fails by resorting to an unsatisfying middle ground. If the movie lived up to its ideal surrealistic potential, then it would have been far more existential and reminiscent of the classic surrealist play NO EXIT than of some nameless suspense/thriller action flick. CUBE would have been so much better off not trying to give a concrete explanation about the labyrinth. The character's original thoughts and assumptions were much more exciting and thought-provoking than the dull, unsatisfying answers given by Worth, the character who, believe it or not, was contracted to draw blueprints for the cube's outer shell.Still, CUBE is not a terrible movie. At times it's exciting, it's unnerving, and it's fascinating. And visually, its a masterpiece. The single set used to depict all the 14'x14'x14' rooms looks terrific, the cinematography is really clever, and the gore effects (which are included but not really needed) are EXTREMELY realistic and disturbing. Plus, as I mentioned earlier, the basic yet innovative plot line of CUBE simply can't be beat.",Null,1,2,3 October 2002
