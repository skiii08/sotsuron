Changeling," A true story....but still hard to swallow
","The first thing to mention here about this movie is that it is a true story. If it wasn't - you'd find it very hard to swallow. First things first - the title? Changeling? I must confess I had never heard that word before and did not know what it meant. I looked it up and found this '(in folklore) an ugly, stupid, or strange child left by fairies in place of a pretty, charming child.' Good description. A single mother - Jolie - goes to work leaving her 9 year old son at home alone. She returns to an empty house. A few months later the police tell her that they have found her son - but when she sees this 'found' boy - it is not her kid. The cops however coerce her to 'try out the boy for a few weeks'. She does so but Jolie's character maintains her stance and continues to rail against the LAPD protesting that her boy is still out there somewhere.It is set in the 1920's and 30's America where Jolie has a telephone exchange job and lives quite well in a nice house, nice neighbourhood alone with only her son as company. The sets are great, the attention to detail spot on - nothing to complain about here. The acting too is impressive. Do I like Jolie? Not really....I cannot see what the fuss is about her on the looks front (she doesn't do it for me I'm afraid) and some of her films leave a little to be desired also. But I won't knock her for this performance - she was solid and played her character well - as a decent human being but also a strong representation of a single woman in an age where equality had not yet surfaced. Her whole celebrity persona turns me off her a little (well a lot actually) but I tried to put that to one side when watching this movie and give her a fair shot at impressing me. She did. They are the good things about the movie....are there any bad things? Of course....Eastwood directed it so there is going to be a couple of glaringly obvious things in there somewhere. The first - and most obvious - comes when Jolie arrives home to find her son gone. Before leaving to do some unscheduled work at the office, Jolie tells her boy that she will be back at 4PM and that a neighbour and her daughter will come over to spend a couple hours with him. But when she gets back home, the kid is gone, and she first looks through the house, then asks some kids on the street if they've seen him, and finally phones the police. They ask her when he disappeared, and she replies 'I don't know. It could have been this morning, or only an hour ago'. Why did she not get in touch with the woman who was supposed to come over for a couple of hours? Shouldn't that have been the FIRST person she would have contacted? The woman could have given her (and the police) an idea of WHEN the kid disappeared. She should also have contacted the woman to see if maybe he was at her house. Unfortunately, the woman seems to have just been entirely forgotten by the script... This is a glaring and sloppy error in the film's logic. How could they let that slip by? A simple scene showing her talking to this woman would suffice - or a scene to inform the audience that no such woman existed - maybe she just told her boy this story to get him to remain indoors and give him a sense of security. One or the other should have happened - but none did.Another biggie for me was the motivation behind the 'impostor' boy. The reason why a small boy would pretend to be a missing child (to move to LA to meet a Hollywood actor) is preposterous and dealt with so matter-of-factly - it was disgraceful. How he got the idea and who encouraged him are inadequately provided. Also, how a 9 year old kid could fool the entire LAPD, doctors, medical people etc. into being someone he is not - is amazingly portrayed. We get some back story implying the LAPD are a corrupt lot with a platoon of gun-toting death squads killing off any competition on the streets to their ill-gotten schemes. But yet these hardened guys could not break a 9 year old boy into telling the truth? Unbelievable. Not only that but the Juvenile police officer had a PHOTOGRAPH of the missing boy - that clearly does not look REMOTELY like this impostor - but yet they never mentioned that in the story. Further on in the movie - a 15 year kid implicated in the disappearance and murder of the boy recognizes the missing kid from the photo straight off - without hesitation, even though he was in a distressed state. I suppose because this is a true story - a lot of these issues are brushed aside - but for me the film did not try to even explain the basic problems here. The whole premise of the story hinges on the boy's disappearance and the subsequent 'finding' - but both of these events are littered with problems. If your basic core of the movie is in trouble - no amount of good acting, fancy sets etc. around the edges will save it.This is not a bad film - far from it - but it is not the classic people whittle on about either. For me it was a little slow too and coming in at a bum numbing 140 minutes doesn't help its case one iota. Eastwood is a good lad, a solid lad - but needs to speed things up a little at times - and a lot at other times.6/10.",6,2,6,16 March 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Yu Ma want to skip this one .....
","3:10 to Yuma is an awful film. Something that I cannot believe the likes of Crowe / Bale / Mangold ever got involved in. I mean - did they even read the script beforehand? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The amount of unbelievable situations this flick throws up is ....how can I say it? Unbelievable!!!! Here's just a quick flavour of what's wrong in this picture: - Peter Fonda's character gets gut shot at point blank range, carried into town on a horse, operated on by a vet and still leads a posse to track Crowe the very next day. Or it could even have been the same day !! - Crowe is a master criminal- so smart he's robbed the railroad umpteen times but instead of heading to Mexico with his gang he waits around for the Marshall's to capture him - even having a drink with Bale as he waits. - Bale got his foot blown off in the Civil War and hobbles most of the time - yet is able to run and jump in the dramatic conclusion like Usain Bolt. - Crowe is supposed to be a psycho yet runs with Bale trying to avoid his own men from setting him free. He must have had a 1000 chances to run the other way and escape.I cannot go on as I would literally bust the 1000 word review limit on IMDb just simply pointing out the ridiculous premise of this movie. No wonder Cruise turned it down. He probably thought it was a joke. He was right.The acting is pretty good - Crowe is quiet and simmering even though he has an unplayable part in my view. His character simply has no logic to him. Bale is brooding and excellent as always - but again, his character makes some decisions that cannot be explained. Idiotic is too kind a word. Foster is eating the scenery as usual - but also good in his over the top way. The direction is OK, cinematography fine. It's just the story line, premise, screenplay that literally makes no sense scene after scene, page after page until the end that has to be watched to be disbelieved. Or better still - don't watch it.Skip the 3:10 guys and hope there's a better train behind it. 2/10 - Awful.",2,4,6,26 April 2017
The Way Back," A long walk would be better for you than watching this...
","I watched this with only a basic understanding of what the background was to the story. Also - I did not know previously that it was Peter Weir's first film for 7 years. He should have stayed where he was.The premise of the story is an extraordinary one - a group of prisoners escape from a Siberian Gulag during the second world war and manage to walk all the way to India. Amazing stuff - especially as it is supposed to be true. However, the articulation of this story left me disappointed.The opening credits tell you the entire story from start to finish through the use of a couple of sentences. Because of this - the whole dynamic of 'what will happen next?' is taken from the viewer, as we already know the end. Anyway - that disappointment aside - the story starts off well enough and a strong early performance from Mark Strong augers well. Then what? The escape happens - off screen - and no more Strong. Things then seem to take the repetitive, undramatic route as we embark on our looooooong journey. Essentially the weak story goes like this: - escape Gulag - start walking through Siberia - encounter hardships - somebody dies - start walking through Mongolia - encounter hardships - somebody dies - start walking through China, Tibet....etc etc. you get the picture until we end up in India. And that's it !!! I ask myself - 'So what?'The characters are one dimensional at best. I got to the stage where I couldn't tell one from the other. And as for the Polish / Russian accents. They may be authentic - I don't know - but the fact that I see two Irish actors (Farrell and Ronan) with strange accents didn't help matters.Acting: Farrell is good here to be honest. He carries that menace and unpredictability around with him with great aplomb. His accent though sullies it for me. Harris and Ronan are okay too. However, Burgess didn't do it for me. His presence, or lack of it, let the film down I fear. But he is new enough to this game so it might get better for him - if he gets another chance.Photography: As you would expect - the landscape dominates the story and is captured beautifully.Overall - watching the film was just as much of an endurance test as the walk itself. And the rushed ending twee to the extreme.Poor - 5/10.",5,12,24,14 April 2011
Gone Baby Gone," Great Movie.....
","I have wanted to watch Gone Baby Gone for some time now but missed it on its cinema release. Finally caught up with it this weekend on DVD.Ben Affleck's directorial debut is nothing short of breath-taking. For a guy who had never lensed before, this is a truly remarkable feat. Direction was spot on, pacing was solid and the story unfolded at just the right momentum. I loved Affleck and Damon's Good Will Hunting - their screenplay and acting superb in that flick - but he has done it again here with this one.I won't go into the synopsis of the movie as everybody knows it by now - but i will say that it really gets you thinking at the end. A moral decision has to be made and it is something that, personally, I thought was the wrong decision by the main character.The scenes in this movie were very realistic - not flash, trumped up over-indulgent luvvy camera work - but simple, straight-forward and effective. Casey Affleck was great in the lead role (his first lead???) and carried the movie very well. If there was to be one criticism to level at this film - it would be Casey's delivery of his lines. At times they were mumbled and coupled with his thick Boston accent meant for a lot straining of ears and rewinds to catch what he had just said.I don't like figuring out the end of movies (sixth sense caught me completely cold) but this one leaves ample clues all the way through that you will figure what happens well before the reveal. But for some reason that did not spoil it for me. The end scene was a tremendous way to close the movie (not unlike the end of Good Will Hunting either if you think about it).For me - this was a breath of fresh air and a thoroughly enjoyable film. Well done the Brothers Affleck.8/10.",9,0,2,20 January 2009
Face_Off," Complete Ham-fisted effort
","When John Woo burst onto the American movie-making scene, he was marked for greatness as a ground-breaking director. But to be honest, he has been found out. There are only so much slow-mo, doves flying and sterile action sequences a man can take - and Woo has run dry.Van Damme's Hard Target was an introduction to Woo - with the poetic jumping and shooting uncountable bullets with two guns whilst twirling in the air. It was good - if you were twelve. Later - MI:2 - which is most definitely the most atrocious film Cruise has ever done (and yes I am including Far and Away in that). Woo just wasn't able to sustain one ounce of dramatic license in an incomprehensible sequence of events.Somewhere in between lies Face/Off.The premise is ridiculous in the extreme. Just listen to Cage / Travolta explaining it in the movie and you can almost hear the laughter off screen. The action scenes were okay - but just that - okay. Not great, not thrilling - just okay. For an action film - that is not a good sign. I gotta be honest here and say that the sugary sweet nature of the film's family tie-ins were so overblown and sickly - that I almost vomited. The final scene is especially nauseating.Cage is maniacal at times and Travolta reasonably straight faced - but they cannot save this film. Plot is not a major influence on Woo and the way the film moves forward is ludicrous. For me 5/10 .... and Gina Gershon bagged 3 of those points on her own...",5,0,1,22 April 2008
The Transporter," was Van Damme not available ????
","All through watching this film - the thought that it was specially written for Jean Claude Vna Damme kept popping up in my head. The naff storyline, the kick-boxing moves, the lack of dialogue for the leading man, the army of nameless heavies, the almost compulsory Japanese bad guy / girl / even director. The plot - which i will NOT go into here - is rudimentary to say the least. The amount of times people just happen to turn up in scenes without any realistic semblance of how they got there is incredible - it must be a record for a movie. Couple this with the total number of unrealistic stunt moves carried out and you have yourself a bona-fide turkey. For instance, trucks propel themselves forward on their own without a need for a driver, a small plane goes from a hundred feet up in the sky to thousands of feet in a blink, the hero can somehow dodge a thousand bullets and still manage to incapacitate 3 bad guys with nothing more than a jumper !!! i watched this knowing what it was beforehand - a cheesy action flick - but it still took some swallowing to believe the plot. The best award must go to the guy who somehow managed to squeeze a further 2 sequels from this franchise. After the first film - the whole cast and crew should have been sent straight to DVD dungeon never to appear again. How they convinced anyone to make another 2 movies is beyond me. The Transporter is a poor man's Bourne - and that is a derisive remark to Bourne. If Van Damme had done this - then it would have stayed where it belonged - the bargain bin.3/10 - just for sheer cheek of conning us with this movie.",3,0,1,12 December 2008
Gran Torino," Not without faults .... but enjoyable nonetheless....
","A lot has been written about this film - Clint's last acting gig, an old Dirty Harry - a supposedly great film. It was not great but I enjoyed it. I think the thing with Eastwood is - you either like him or you don't. I like him. Sure he's made some terrible films in the past (Absolute Power anyone?) but he more than makes up for those with his good ones (Dollars trilogy/Josey Wales). This is not his best nor his worst outing.The character he plays is a Korean war veteran who finds himself alone in the world after the death of his wife. His neighbourhood is almost entirely occupied by Asians and after 50 years working on the Ford assembly line - finds himself with nothing in common with his kids and his only friend is his dog. Most films these days are so PC that they lose all remnants of believability - not so this one. Eastwood's character Walt Kowalski calls it as he sees it - and does not hold back on the insults. Especially race-related ones. So what happens here? Not much really. It is a slow piece of work with no big moments (until the end) and follows the relationship between an aging old man and a good-hearted naïve young Asian boy next door. Now that sounds a little seedy if taken out of context ;-) But somehow it seems to work. Despite the bad acting from some of the Asian actors (who can be excused as it was their first time in front of a camera) and a priest actor who is in my mind the most blandest, irrelevant, worst-acted character in the whole movie (this guy could have coloured the movie a bit if Clint put in a heavy hitter for this part - I kept thinking Norton as I watched) - the movie still has some good things going for it. The storyline is okay without being spectacular and the references to the Gran Torino in the title was not strong enough for me. But Clint's character is like so many of his previous reincarnations - that you just have to root for him.But it is not without its faults: - The editing at times seem to make basic chronological mistakes. Eastwood does tend not to follow normal film-making rules when editing films with characters popping up all over the place in adjacent scenes - but a special mention here must go to the scene where Eastwood is smoking in the bath. He tells his dog to go easy on him smoking in the house as he never does that. Yet 5 minutes EARLIER we see him smoking in the living room with no such problems. - Believability is stretched at times. Eastwood pulls up to three black guys hassling Sue's character. He stares them all down and spits on the ground ala Josey Wales' 'You gonna pull them pistols or whistle Dixie' scene. The youths are big, scary black guys - Clint is old, decrepit and even though he pulls a gun eventually - the menace is no longer there. He also manages to beat up a gang-hardened youth on the kid's front lawn. As much as I want the 78 year old 'Man-with-no-name' throwback to exact some vengeance - is it credible? No. - Irrelevant scenes permeate the film too. Okay - it is hard to stretch out this story as not much happens but there are still some things which do not advance the story one little bit. The barber for instance adds nothing of worth to the plot - and if those scenes were not there - nobody would notice. However - having said that, the second scene where Thao has to talk tough in the barber shop is hilarious. - The acting. Hmmm. Dodgy. Clint is fine - as usual - and so is the girl Asian - Sue. The priest is terrible, Thao hit and miss and some of the Asian gang leave a lot to be desired too. But can you blame these guys? No - it is their first time. Can you blame Clint for putting them up there? Maybe - a little. - The end. I won't give it away but I'd be surprised if you don't see it from a mile off. Clint gives plenty of hints as to what's coming.For me Gran Torino was an enjoyable watch - slow but engaging - not without faults but the overall movie misses its mark on too many occasions to be truly considered great. 7/10.",7,0,3,12 March 2009
The Illusionist," Sumptuous Movie.....
","I really enjoyed The Illusionist. A very well made movie, well acted and a great story. When I first recorded the movie, I must admit I had my doubts as to its suitability for me. I'm not exactly a 'magic man' type of guy to be honest but it soon won me over. The pace, look and feel of the movie was splendid. A steady pace throughout and the film was shot in a subtle old-fashioned manner which I thoroughly enjoyed. Edward Norton - as he is normally - is excellent here. His character a long lost love of a Duchess - the beautiful, radiant Jennifer Biel. I had never seen Biel in anything before this - but she is totally believable here and very pretty indeed. Giamatti - as the police inspector - is great too. His demeanour, walk and speech perfectly suited to the times and his position within the society of that era. That era involving the late 19th century Vienna is yet a further character in the story - exquisitely depicted and the attention to detail is second to none. The name of the film gives the viewer a strong hint that not all is what it seems here and even though I knew something was going to twist, my enjoyment of the film was not stolen from me as I did not predict the ending. Other - more smarter - people I am sure will see it coming but in this instance it is nice to have that little bit of ignorance. There are a couple of plot points that maybe could have been expanded on a tad - to fully drive home the story - but I am nitpicking here.To me - a superb film with great acting and fabulous sets and a solid story. What more could you ask for? 8/10.",8,0,1,18 December 2009
Casualties of War," An underrated masterpiece ......
","I like war films when done well. Platoon was fantastic and I'm gonna put Casualties of War right up there with that multi-Oscar winner. That may sound a little haughty from me – but this film is deserving of such an accolade. The story is harrowing, the material itself shocking at times – but the overall result is a masterpiece.I won't go into the plot details here in this review as it has been well covered at this stage but I will go into certain specific elements of the movie.Acting: Fox is fantastic here – never better. Fox is a good actor anyway, we all know that, but I feel he does not get the credit he deserves sometimes. To some he will always be Marty McFly from the BTTF movies (to be honest he will be to me too) but he really puts in a great shift in this flick. His naturalistic, everyman style makes you want to root for him no matter what. He carries the film in my view as the only true upstanding character in the army who sticks by his beliefs no matter what. Actually – the fact that this incident took place in the Vietnam war is a side issue if you ask me – it could have happened anywhere at any time. It is truly about humanity's morality as opposed to being about a war or those who took part in it. But for me – Fox is terrific.Penn is brilliant too. An angry, tobacco chewing 20-year old Sarge – dumped in a world of pain and suffering. You can see his motivations and where the frustrations have caused him to carry out the horrible act in the film. Penn is another brilliant actor in my view – in so far as whenever I see him, I believe he 'is' the character and not just 'acting' as that character. Here is the ultimate proof of his abilities. Some reviewers say that he 'overacts' a little here – but to me it is simply his intensity.The girl who plays the rape victim - Thuy Thu Le - is also terrific. A true testament of finding a talent out there without a background of acting who can turn in a performance amongst the best that Hollywood can offer. It's such a pity that this film was her one and only performance.The rest of the cast varies a little. Erik King as Brownie hams it up a little in a couple of scenes (just look at his facial expressions as the unit walks into a Vietnamese village for pure contortion) but does well in others (when he gets shot). Don Harvey as Clark is a parody of a evil persona within the movie – an OTT performance. John C Reilly is okay. Ving Rhames is okay. Leguizamo is good as the conflicted Diaz. Dale Dye is terrific – intense and totally believable, his one-on-one with Fox superb.Cinematography: De Palma's style runs through this movie like a river. He is a genius. The angles he uses (Fox's chat with Dye), the foreground/background shots (When Fox is traumatized from Brownie's shooting in the foreground and the background shows the villagers helping the VC soldier to escape), the courtroom scene (where we see the accused soldiers one by one and only ever hear the prosecutor), the long tracking shots (Basecamp Wolf) and the superb Leone-like close ups (Fox in the rain) are all beautiful. And there is so much more also – VC tunnels, burned out fields, the kidnapping itself, another background/foreground shot when the girl is stabbed – that are used to tremendous effect. The brutal nature of the story and the action is still magnificently displayed through a masterclass of cinema-making techniques from a truly gifted director.The screenplay, music, production values are all top notch and the story rattles along at a nice pace. This is a movie in which anyone who was remotely involved in it could be extremely proud. Well done all.9/10 – I deducted the point for the sometimes ropy acting of some of the periphery characters and for one emotional speech from Fox which was simply too preachy and overlong.",9,4,5,19 April 2011
Prisoners," A must-see thriller/mystery with excellent acting...
","Prisoners - 9/10 Superb film. Great story-line, pacing, acting. It has it all. After I finished watching it, I remarked that it was the best film I've seen in a long time. And I've seen a lot. A simplistic plot summary is this: 2 girls go missing near their homes and a frantic search for them primarily from parent Hugh Jackman and detective Jake Gyllenhaal begins. The raw, rough landscape - the washed out grays and browns in the picture - the cold, the rain: all help to make the atmosphere of the film, one of realism and desperation. There are a few red herrings thrown in here and there as we progress (or so I thought) but ultimately they all somehow connect (however tenuously in places). As I watched the film, some things happened which I could not see how they related to the overall plot - but a second watch helped out a lot in this regard. Some elements of the film were a little strange but the storyteller didn't skimp on content that's for sure. He threw everything at this and although richly populated and seemingly unconnected at times - it all adds up in the end. Barely. But it adds up nonetheless. So huge credit is due to the storyteller and the director for bringing us something a little different, a little left-field but the most credit must go to the two main actors. I've never seen Jackman in anything except Wolverine (not even the X-Men series - but just the spin off) and he is what he is in that movie - a mutant wolf-like creature/human. He does pretty well as this - but I must admit I had no idea of his acting chops. Well, here he shows us in spades. He's angry, riled, tired, exhausted, violent, desperate - at times all in the one scene - and portrays it brilliantly. A little OTT with the wild eyes in one or two scenes - but that is being picky. He held that pent-up and at times unleashed anger throughout the film expertly. But even Jackman was outdone by Gyllenhaal. Now I have seen a lot of this guy's films ever since his breakthrough in Donnie Darko. He is good. Getting better. And has a massive future ahead of him. He can do anything in my opinion, he has it all. Here, he brings a weird edge to detective Loki - with his neck tattoo, his mason ring, his weird haircut, buttoned up shirts and general worldliness. He is a character that without knowing anything about his background or personal life, comes across as a dangerous, slightly unhinged individual with a troubled past, and maybe an even more conflicting future. But for now, he's a cop and a damn good one. Gyllenhaal even gives this guy a tick - with the constant eye-blinking - which simply adds to his mystique. Tremendous, faultless acting by Gyllenhaal makes him a wonder to watch.Not to mention great turns by a creepy Paul Dano and another misfit David Dastmalchian. Both extremely convincing and off-putting in equal measure. Also, an early outing for Dylan Minnette - now, the excellent Clay Jensen from 13 Reasons Why. In short - great movie - and without giving away the ending too much - a clincher to finish. A must-see.",9,0,0,12 May 2017
The Graduate," Sacrilegious maybe - but i thought it was poor
","I've never seen The Graduate until last week. But I knew of it's reputation - a timeless classic. Apparently. I also looked up the rating on IMDb - 8.1 - impressive. So I dived right in there to witness what all the fuss was about.I'm sorry but I just don't see it? I don't get it at all. Far from being a classic - I think it is a particularly dumb and totally far fetched movie with strange scenes, dialog, situations and a weird ending.Okay - the premise seems reasonable at first - a newly graduated young man - Ben (Hoffman) - begins an affair with Anne Bancroft (Mrs. Robinson)- a mature friend of the family. But then falls for her daughter instead. Sounds OK - doesn't it? But is it executed well? Not in my opinion.Firstly - Mrs. Robinson's attitude in seducing Benjamin initially is totally incredible and unbelievable. She is an attractive woman and Ben is young, socially inept around others and not to mention short and geeky looking. Why would she would even bother with him in the first place was my initial thought. But to persevere after being rebuked several times beggars belief. But the affair happens and thru circumstances - Ben is forced to go on a date with Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine (Katherine Ross at her most beautiful). Then we are supposed to believe that he falls in love with Elaine at the drop of a hat and wants to marry her? Ridiculous. And she wants to marry him too - after he treated her like dirt initially and then she found out that he slept with her mother? Again ridiculous. And the ending? Don't even get me started on that. I won't spoil it here for everyone - but to say it is laughable is to be generous to it in the extreme.There are some clever camera tricks all the way through - however the 'snap' editing of Mrs. Robinson's nude scene was NOT one of them - but it isn't enough to save this poor attempt at a story. Simon and Garfunkel's music is okay - and maybe I am been too harsh here as I am not a fan of them either - but again the music can only do so much for a film.In all - and I assume I am in the minority here - I thought the film was shoddy. 4/10 and 2 of those points are there for Ross' looks alone.",4,1,3,23 August 2012
Invincible," Rocky on the Football Field
","Who doesn't like an underdog story? A story where the hero comes from nothing to make it at the very top. Rocky did it - but that was from the brain of Stallone, a fictional story and character. However, Invincible is about a true life Joe who overcame all the odds to be a pro-football player.I'm from the other side of the pond - Ireland - and football to me means something completely different. Neither do I have any interest in American football and not much knowledge of the rules / set-plays / special teams etc. etc. But this movie transcends all that and delivers a message centered around belief, never giving up on your dream and most importantly of all - friendship.Mark Wahlberg is very good in his portrayal of Vince Papale - a 30 year old barman from Philidelphia who makes it on to a professional football team - Eagles - after an open try-out session organised by the new, desperate coach. Wahlberg has really improved in his acting as his career develops. Sure, he has duds (Planet of the Apes anyone?) but he has successes too (Basketball Diaries, Four Brothers, Shooter). This role is perfect for him. Even though he looks a little small to be a footballer, it simply adds to his likability. He is certainly well-built but his hangdog, everyman look fits so easily here that I, as a viewer, could totally buy into the fact that he was a down on his luck, out of work teacher trying hard to make his way in tough times in a tough city. He plays the role with such respect and pathos - that's its hard not to root for the guy. When he eventually makes it - I felt a warm fuzzy feeling inside. Mission accomplished from his point of view.The direction of the movie is above average. First time director Ericson Cole does a good job on the scene setting, football sequences and some nice touches of CGI for some of the stadium shots. The opening montage depicting life in 1970's Philly to the backdrop of Jim Croce's lilting music is a fantastic introduction to the movie. I'm sure there are some liberties taken with the 'true' story but for dramatic effect there has to be - so no complaints here on that score. After all, for me, it is a movie first and a true story second.Banks does a nice job with her (slightly underwritten) part as does all the buddies from Max's bar. Kinnear too is good as new coach Vermeil. But without Wahlberg stepping up to the mark - the whole thing could have gone down the toilet. But he is brilliant here. Even though Wahlberg has had his troubles down through the years (I could not stand him as Marky Mark) he has matured a lot and has a little rags to riches flavour about his own life too. Yet, he doesn't seem to act like a movie star. He projects the image of a quiet, hard working, prepared individual who knows how lucky he is to be where he is today and is not about to get all 'showbusiness' and lose it all.Overall, the movie is an uplifting, inspiring story with some great gravitas and excellent performances. The only quibble I have is the sheer number of scenes in the film which show Wahlberg walking alone down a street, away from the camera. Not sure if this was supposed to signify something or not but it just got a little tiresome after a while. However - that is a small gripe. The other downside to the film is it's promotion over in Europe was very low key. So low key in fact that I do not even remember if it had a cinema release or not. I know it's a tough sell because of the American Football element but the DVD could have been pitched better too. Not a criticism of the movie per se but rather of the distribution of it.Great movie, great performances, inspiring stuff. 8/10.",8,0,1,20 May 2010
Defiance," Waaaaaay too slow for me.....poor
","I have only ever seen Daniel Craig in one other film - the disappointing Munich - and wanted to see what the star fuss was about here with this one. The answer? Nothing. He wasn't bad here by no means - but the film let him down and by some mad counter-balancing act, he let the film down too. I must also admit to disliking Liev Schreiber as an actor but here he was more than good. In fact, I'll so far as to say if he had the lead then maybe the film would have been more enjoyable. Craig just didn't seem to fit. He looked exactly like he was - an actor playing a part. His hair was too perfect, his frame did not look like it missed too many meals, his eyes too pretty-boy for a hardened leader living rough in the woods. Schreiber on the other hand looked like a man born to live in the forest and had the ruthlessness in him to kill anything that dared get in his way.The storyline involves the desperate attempts of Jews retreating to the forest to escape the certain death from the Germans. Because it is also a true story - then the signs should be good. But the dull, slow-pacing, episodic way that Zwick tells the story is enough to bore you to tears. Also the ending is a trifle insulting to be honest. Remember this guy also made The Last Samarai - another slow, poor-ending film.The story centers on the 3 brothers who are the leaders of this group of Jewish survivours - Craig, Screiber and Jamie Bell. But Bell gets pushed into the background and hardly has anything to do here until a brief flurry near the end. The remainder of the group are for me - two dimensional and stereotypical to really care about. And some parts of the movie are downright ridiculous. In an attack on a German Outpost - Schreiber's character receives multiple gunshots to his body (in a poorly edited scene by the way). To me I felt sure this meant certain death, but the next day he had his arm in sling, and that was that! HE HAD BEEN SHOT SEVERAL TIMES AT CLOSE RANGE IN THE CHEST and without any medical supervision he not only survives, but looks stronger than ever. How is that possible? Even Arnie's Terminator would have at least flinched a couple of times at this assault.In the end the film was waaaaaaay too slow, not engaging enough and despite some strong performances by some of the cast, some nice photography along the way - it just doesn't gel. The false Jewish accents coupled with the polish and Russian dialog - hinders rather than helps. Poor. 5/10.",5,2,5,12 March 2009
The Deer Hunter," Too long, too choppy, not as good as they lead you to believe.....
","The Deer Hunter is one of those revered films out there in critic-land which I have always wanted to see and examine for myself what all the fuss is about. The DVD presentations - Special Edition / Ultimate Edition / Bonus Discs etc. - almost tease you into buying it. Thank God I caught it on TV instead. The winner of the Best Picture Oscar in 1978 is a disappointment to me. I'll try to articulate why: 1. The actors - this is a misnomer - there are no problems here. De Niro is good and Walken too. Both have their own head-jerking, body-twitching thing going on there but they are solid - even if they do look off screen at some non-existent object quite a lot. But I must admit De Niro did start to grate on me as the film wore on - the mono-syllabic grunts, the thousand yards stares all get a little tiresome after 3 hours. But as problems lie - acting was not one of them.2. The story - For me the story of friends joining the army, fighting in Vietnam and then returning to the world broken men - if they return at all - is interesting and the Russian roulette element adds a definite spice. However - the movie is just way too long, too drawn out and too clippy in the scene cuts. There is lots of time invested in the build up of the characters but wasted in my opinion as it never drives on the narrative. The wedding scenes are a prime example - you can fast-forward these wedding scenes completely and not miss a beat of the story. The fact there was a wedding at all serves the purpose - but to show dancing, drinking for over 20 minutes is lazy.3. Pacing - so slow it almost stops. And when we do get to some action - Russian roulette scenes - we simply arrive there out of the blue, do the action and get out as quickly as possible. After spending far too much time with a irrelevant wedding - we jump in and out of the torture scenes with incredible speed.4. Reality. Now I don't know much about war or armies or anything but a few things stand out here. The guys get wasted the night before they fly out to Vietnam? No training? They all end up in the same platoon? With their long hair still intact? De Niro's character in particular seems to be able to do what he wants, when he wants and answers to no-one. He walks around Vietnam alone? Grows a beard in the army? Goes home to the US and then decides to go back to find Nick? How - on Uncle Sam's meal ticket? He arrives in Saigon when every man and his dog are killing each other to get out? He finds Nick in a city of millions without a second thought? He has money to burn - paying 1500 dollars to get into a barn? What? What's going on here? De Niro seems to live in a universe where there are no limitations on travel / money / relationships / pain / injury. Also De Niro was supposed to have humped crippled Stevie through the Jungle to 'civilization', only to dump him on the hood of a jeep and walk away ? 5. Coincidences - De Niro seems to be a Green Beret - how did this happen? His buddies look like ordinary grunts yet they all joined together. Nick and Steve just happen along De Niro in the Vietnamese jungle when they jump from a chopper? What's the odds on that? 3 bullets in the gun which never goes off when it is pointed at their own heads - but which fires every time it is pointed at a bad guy? Convenient. Too many things to mention here that just happen for the sake of it.6. Editing - even at 3+ hours - the finished product looks chopped to pieces in the editing room. Plus the scene that promotes the name of the film - The Deer Hunter - seems tacked on and looks completely out of place. It is almost as if they didn't know what to call the movie - invented this monicker - and filmed a quick couple of scenes to back it up.I am not sure how this film is in the top 250. Cimino has proved since that he was not up to it as a filmmaker. This is an overlong, slow, muddled movie which does not deserve the glory bestowed upon it.5/10.",5,2,4,7 April 2009
The Fighter," The Fighter packs a hell of a punch...
","Ever since it was announced that Wahlberg was trying to get this film made - and that was a looooooong time ago at this stage - I have been eagerly awaiting the arrival of this film. I was not disappointed.Not to re-hash the story too much but this is a real life story of Boston boxer 'Irish' Micky Ward and the struggles with his career, personal and family life in the mid-90s. Wahlberg is Micky Ward and Bale plays his crack addicted, squirrelly brother Dicky Eklund. The style of the film is more realistic than the likes of 'Rocky', 'Raging Bull' and other fight films. It has some nice HBO TV style fight scenes which is shot is a clearer presentation akin to watching the bouts on prime-time television. But the meat of the story and the conflict is not in Micky's quest to achieve a world title - but in his ultimately uncomfortable relationship he has with his family. 7 girls, 2 boys, 2 fathers and 1 mother is a hell of a mix in a poor neighbourhood. Add to that Micky's mother is also his manager, his brother is his coach, his father also a coach and you see how complicated this could become. Micky is essentially the meal ticket for the entire clan.Performances: Bale is terrific. If he doesn't get the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year, then I'll eat my left shoe. (I might regret that last statement as Geoffrey Rush seems to be swooping that accolade for 'The King's Speech') But nonetheless - Bale deserves it. His portrayal of a crack addicted, might-have-been is spot on. Twitchy, wide-eyed, slurred but his stint in prison and the viewing of his so called 'comeback' documentary straightened him out and made him realise what is important. Family. His brother. Adams is a ballsy character too - she has to be to survive in this environment. A strong woman who stands up for herself and her man against a formidable family group. I didn't know anything about Adams previous to this film but she seems to have that slightly grubby yet likable nature about her. Leo as the mother/manager is a tough piece of work also. The family actually reminds me of so many families that I grew up with and in - that even though you know it is exaggerated on screen - there are many veins of truth running through it. Lastly - but not least - Wahlberg himself. He has such a quiet way about him that even though he is a tough cookie, grew up in VERY similar circumstances to Ward and portrays a hardy boxer with a physique to match any professional - he remains an enigma. He comes across as a truly nice guy - both on screen and in real life. Even though he has had his brushes with the law (most famously his own stint in jail for a racist assault which resulted in his victim being left permanently blind in one eye), he really seems to have his life on track. Successful actor, producer, father and husband is a testament to his ability to stay the track. Here - his performance is an understated one but still packs a punch amidst the other more animated characters. He is the soul of the film both on the screen and in the background trying to get the thing made. None of the honours mention him but he knows deep down he has made something to be very proud of. Well done Marky Mark - you've come a long way from the Funky Bunch.Overall - I'll score this 8/10. Some scenes a little slow to boil, some 'patchy' dialogue in places but overall it's heart is in the right place.",8,3,3,14 February 2011
