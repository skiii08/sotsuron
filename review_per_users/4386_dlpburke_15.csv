Vertigo," Oh Dear - What a MESS!
","This film is exceedingly annoying to watch - unless you happen to be one of the multitude of pretentious fools who think their intellect is better than everyone else's because they 'get it'. Well, I have news for those dumb-asses: There is nothing to get.Vertigo is plodding, annoying, and the pacing is terrible. The characters do not act like real people; it's yet another film where this is the case. What makes it all the more infuriating is that there IS a clever story buried under all the sewage, clawing to get out. And it never does. Even at the end, there's a brief moment where things actually make sense - where there is some semblance of reality - only for it to be dashed by one of the most ludicrous finales I HAVE EVER SEEN. It's THAT BAD. That ending would be laughed out of the cinema today (and probably was back then), but because this film is considered a 'classic', it's applauded as some kind of masterpiece. It isn't. It's just an exceedingly daft finale to a grossly unrealistic film.The only way I could possibly enjoy Vertigo is if I had very little logical thinking. Unfortunately for all the die-hard movie buffs masturbating in unison, I am not a conformist who feels a need to nod their head in agreement, just because society says I am in the presence of brilliance. I was not in the presence of brilliance, just stupidity. The emperor has no clothes.My rating: 1/5.",1,39,70,5 November 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," Meaningless
","It's just more meaningless garbage dressed up with fireworks and graphics and sold to the mindless masses. And it worked.If you are even thinking of going to watch Star Wars Episode VII, just remember that Abrams is in charge and he, and his cohorts, will make that a simplistic, illogical, fanboy driven (as in the 'YAY! LIGHT SABERS!' brigade) mess.I'd love to waste my time reviewing this title properly, but I'm going to skip. Sadly, it's everything we've come to expect from modern day films. Flash, no substance, and the selling point is endless CGI / battle.Wake up, people.",1,4,10,17 April 2015
12 Angry Men," Good Movie Ruined By Left Wing Bias and Smugness
","12 Angry Men is entertaining, mostly well acted, and worth a watch. It could have been far better but, from the outset, the film was designed only to take a pot-shot at the Right, and promote a Left Wing Progressive viewpoint as the absolute truth. This story is hardcore propaganda and, judging by its score on IMDb, has succeeded in fooling a great number of people. What is interesting to me is that the Left-wing's brainwashing started this early. Hollywood is still churning out the same bias today (go and read my Dark Knight review).The movie has a very interesting premise: An open-and-shut case is called in to question when one man on the twelve-man jury slowly convinces the others that the eighteen year old on trial for the murder of his father may, in fact, be innocent. That's got some real potential, hasn't it? Sadly, the gone-in-the-head Leftist who wrote this did what I feared he would: loaded the dice and peddled a Leftist agenda - namely one that excuses criminals of their actions and seeks to end the death penalty. That's the film's overwhelming goal. It wants the audience to come away from the movie, not with a greater appreciation of the legal system, but with the view that the death penalty should be abolished and that anyone who objects to this is a deluded, little bigot. Let's look at the facts we are given:-Spoilers from here on- 1. An 18 year old is on trial for the murder of his father. He has no alibi. The alibi he gave to police (that he was in a theatre the whole time) fell apart when he could not recall anything about the movies that were showing - even their names.2. There are two main witnesses: One saw the defendant leaving the scene of the crime (and heard the event); the other saw the murder take place through a window and identified the defendant. The defendant was also heard shouting in anger 'I'm gonna kill you', the same day as the murder.3. The knife (with a very rare design) used in the murder is the same knife that the defendant had bought earlier and was carrying around. His friends testified to this effect.4. The defendant is an habitual criminal who has had numerous run-ins with the law, including two arrests for knife fighting. He is said to be 'real handy with a knife'.5. The defendant has a clear motive: His father was repeatedly violent and abusive towards him, and had beaten him regularly (with fists) since he was five years of age, including the day of the murder.I was intrigued. Why does this one juror believe the defendant may not be guilty? How could he convince the rest that there is reasonable doubt? Despite the fact I feared these questions would receive fob-offs, I was still hopeful an intelligent investigation would be crafted around them. But no. Straight away, the film deliberately loads the dice by having certain jurors holding prejudiced or otherwise undesirable traits, while the dissenting voice is calm, collected, and supremely open-minded. That's cliché, and a very common Leftist tactic (you'll see it a lot on shows like Star Trek).The film takes each of the facts above and finds an absurd alternate explanation for them, such as the knife could have fallen out of the defendants pocket and the true murderer used an identical knife (this is the fantastic explanation given by our Leftist hero). The film has a moronic moment where the 'hero' pulls out a knife he has bought (illegally), which appears identical to the one in question. The idea being that it isn't so rare, after all.Other silly moments include the jury discussing why the defendant would come home a few hours later if he had indeed done the crime. Not one of them mentions that the defendant lives there and would have to come back home in order to allay fears that he was the murderer. It's part of an alibi. What else is he going to do, disappear and hope that the police don't find that a tad suspicious? Nearly every explanation given in favour of the defendant is absurd or complete conjecture.When you string all the known facts together, the chances of them all being explained away in a fashion that exonerates the defendant is literally millions to one. It's so implausible that no sane jury would acquit. But the writer wants this to happen, so it does (and 12-0 in favour, just in case you missed the point). I love it when writers do that. Don't you? At one point, the following dialogue takes place:'No-one can know a thing like that; this isn't an exact science.' 'That's right, it isn't.' Okay, then, let's just forget putting people on trial because we can hardly ever be 100% sure that they did the crime in question, can we? The number of victims created by having no deterrent, or by allowing dangerous criminals to go free, is FAR GREATER than the absolute minority case where an innocent person is found guilty. Some people cannot be reasoned with and are far too broken to be rehabilitated. They are like a dangerous dog. We don't try to change the nature of a dangerous dog because we know it's futile, and we know that by ignoring it, we are just risking more innocent lives. This really isn't rocket science, it's just that the Leftist types (who have a huge stranglehold on the media/TV) refuse to budge, and muddy the waters with their insane Progressive agenda.People cheering this movie are cheering for a violent thug, who got away with first-degree murder. It's not hip, it's just dumb. Wake up.My rating: 3/5",1,34,127,8 October 2015
Pan's Labyrinth," Your Life Depends On It
","I have voted this 1 to reduce the average. A fair score is 4.Yup, don't eat anything, your life depends on it. So what happens? Well, she decides to go munch on a few forbidden snacks. I mean, really? Aren't we past this kind of bad writing by now? Most over-hyped film I have ever seen (I think). I am not going to bother reviewing this film properly because to do so would waste yet more of my time. This film is plodding, ridiculous, and lazily written.Some very good reviewers gave this film rave reviews. I thought, for once, I couldn't go wrong. Fat chance. If you like well written movies with well-rounded characters, and not just pretty visuals, make sure you get lost in a labyrinth as it might save you from this stinker.",2,2,16,23 January 2013
Taxi Driver," Another Pseudointellectual Movie
","This movie joins the likes of Dr. Strangelove, Citizen Kane, and 2001: A Space Odyssey . It's not clever at all and it's about nothing. Some mentally ill taxi driver boogies around at night - That's all. Most of the film is taken up by slow scenes, totally unrealistic dialogue and situations, and a totally unrealistic portrayal of New York, yet Taxi Driver is currently rated 8.4 on IMDb.There are two reasons for this: One is that wannabe gangsters will vote any film like this high, and the other is that people like Roger Ebert are the perfect example of a modern day Emperor's New Clothes. If the plot and script are nonsensical, they'll hail it a masterpiece and tell you that you are just too stupid to see the genius involved (for the record, 2001: A Space Odyssey doesn't have ANY story at all, but is still called 'deep'). Those of us with an ounce of sanity are not happy sitting through a film that's about nothing (with the exception of a few scenes with Jodie Foster, who plays an underage prostitute) and has a pace slower than a tortoise on whiskey.The acting isn't bad, but the talent is wasted on a script as crap as this.I'd only recommend watching this to tick the 'seen it' box.",3,4,14,3 October 2015
Léon: The Professional," Lasted 30 Minutes
","It really deserved to last only 10 minutes, but I give every film at least 30 minutes now before switching it off (if it is poor). The acting, script, and story, in the 30 minutes I have just seen, were shambolic and a waste of my time. There is no way a film with that start can possibly get any better.No-one in this film talks or behaves like a real person, and the direction is all over the place. It's just more moronic titillation for the mindless masses, and yet ANOTHER overrated film in IMDb's top 250. Seriously, some of the films in that list are there because of dumb people - and dumb people alone. These days, plot isn't necessary as long as you have cartoon characters shooting people left, right, and centre.No thanks.",1,13,49,24 October 2015
Man of Steel," Tried To Give It A Chance
","And it's been turned off after 10 minutes. Feel so sorry for any intelligent person that went to watch this expecting a good film - although I guess most intelligent people, like me, didn't fall for it in the first place. I don't really think any of the Superman films have been good, but this one is just along the same-old lines we've seen recently a thousand times. It's all about action and explosions, and nothing to do with plot or character development.At least I laughed at Superman IV. This is trying to look serious. That's the real joke haha. When people stop going to the cinema falling for this tripe, the movie makers will start to put effort into a film, instead of laughing at the sheep. Baaaaaa!",1,4,11,28 July 2016
North by Northwest," Failed My 30 Minute Test
","This film is the latest to fail my 30 minute test. I give every film 30 minutes and, in that time, if the film has promise, I watch the remainder. The only films that fail the test are those that are very poor, for one reason or another.In the case of North by Northwest, the issue is blatantly clear: The script is ridiculously contrived, and the story is totally unbelievable. I cannot watch a serious film when it disregards reality in such a casual, off-hand manner. The premise of a man on the run because of mistaken identity is not too shabby, but there are so many insulting things the writer does to force the story. I'll give you one example, of many, in the first 30 minutes:Protagonist is abducted at gun point from a busy public building (already, that's absurd) by two men, who then take him elsewhere. He meets their boss, who tells him that he may as well drop the innocent act, and that his identity is known. After he unsuccessfully tries to convince the abductors that they have the wrong man, they force bourbon down his throat, and then attempt to crash him off a cliff, in an effort to make his death look like an accident. Even though the quantity of alcohol he has ingested would render him completely helpless, he somehow fights off one of the abductors and takes control of the car, managing to drive it for a long while before the police apprehend him. He is arrested and tells his story to the police and judge. So far, the writer wants us to believe that these professionals have:1. Abducted someone in this ridiculous fashion 2. Made a massive mistake with one of their targets 3. Been too stupid to realize after the protestations that the protagonist is not the man they are looking for 4. Have chosen a ridiculous method to kill their target. Seriously, if they were as organized as we're led to believe, the protagonist would just disappear. No professional would drive someone off a cliff.The level of realism is already rock bottom, and it only gets worse from this point on (sigh... for example, the protagonist decides to do his own investigation work, which involves entering the hotel room of the intended target, even though he has come close to being murdered. NO-ONE WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT DOING THIS. HUMANS DON'T BEHAVE THIS WAY.Everything that happens is totally unbelievable and against how real people think and operate. In order to make the film work, the writer has had to cheat by making everyone act like a moron. I absolutely guarantee you that if you take the initial incident and apply it to real life, it would end with the villains apologizing for mistaking you for someone else, your own death, or the villains being arrested. With a foundation that is SO rotten, nothing of worth can possibly grow.I love some of Hitchcock's films (especially Dial M For Murder, and Frenzy), but this is just absolute nonsense.",1,8,24,1 November 2015
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Very average.
","Unless you are one of these people still dazzled by fight scenes and graphics, this film will be very average for you. 7/10 is about the most I would expect any sane person to bestow upon this (and IMDb has proved yet again that there are far more stupid people about than intelligent ones).Firstly, when going into a film based on a comic book, you have to extend your suspension of disbelief. If I came into this review lambasting the far fetched powers, then that would be rather silly. Although X-Men is based in our world, being a comic book, it is afforded some leeway. Even so, I would just like to point out that much of what goes on in the X-Men is scientifically impossible, so I don't rate it as a sci-fi... more a sci-fantasy.I won't go into a big review with this film, because I don't think it really deserves that much attention. Instead, I will summarize: The Good: 1. The film is mostly well paced (apart from that stupid video game sequence at the start).2. The acting is good.3. The visuals are good. One scene in particular, which is in slow motion (you will know what I mean when you see it), is pretty cool and well made.4. The characters are likable.The Bad: 1. The X-Men's abilities are far too powerful, especially Magneto's. Not only does it come across as laughable, some of the things they achieve, but more importantly, it breaks the tension. Instead of fearing the worst for our heroes and for their future, we are constantly allowing for an 'anything can happen' scenario. There is one part of the movie where Magneto lifts a giant structure (no spoilers) off the ground like it is a piece of play-doh. That's all well and good, but without a shred of believability (even for X-Men), and without seeing some sort of limit to these powers, there is no dramatic tension. The movie does at least place limits on some of the other characters... for a time.2. The plot is very basic. When I found out this film had a time travel element, I was interested. Unfortunately, that potential is wasted here, so don't go into this movie expecting some really well written time travel stuff. The way in which the time travel works in this film is not original either (despite some claims), and has been done countless times before- for example in Babylon 5 (my favourite show, and infinitely better written than this). The general plot is way too simplistic. The pacing may be decent, but the story just plods along. No decent twists or parts where you have to engage your brain. It's just auto-pilot storytelling.3. JFK was killed by Oswald. I am sick and tired of seeing conspiracy garbage portrayed as reality. If you are a logical person, and have done proper research, you will come to the sane conclusion that Oswald did it. The odds on it not being him are astronomical, based on the wealth of evidence that exists. The film does include a twist in this regard, but it's an absolutely absurd twist.4. Evolution does not work like this film supposes. There are too many writers out there that have no idea how it works, or how science in general works. When dealing with a film like the X-Men, you'd think they would hire proper advisers.Overall, I was disappointed with the film, but it was still worth the watch, and the day out to the cinema. 6/10",5,15,35,8 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Why Did You Watch It?
","Yeah, it's me from last year. You remember?My question is, why did you go and watch this one, when you already knew what to expect? Seriously.More over the top nonsense... more death defying stunts... more unrealistic situations... and to top of off, Jackson thinking he is better than Tolkien.When are you lot going to learn???The sad truth is, nothing can fix The Hobbit. The initial decision to make 3 movies out of a small novel doomed any hope there was of making this work. As usual, the smell of money was too alluring to weak minds like Jackson's, and so we have this dross. It's a shame.",1,43,82,14 December 2013
Batman Begins," Signs Of Mediocrity From The Beginning
","Perhaps this deserves a 3. I am not willing to expend any more of my time on the film to decide. I think 4 is about right. The tell-tale sign of an inept director, and an inept script, are present from the get-go. Scenes exist that are only present in films trying to stave off boredom by presenting flashy visuals at break-neck speeds. All flash - no substance. When you see a simple scene cut up into tons of half-second segments, you KNOW there's a problem; the action scenes are absolutely pitiful due to this. The viewer has absolutely no idea what is going on. It's an editor's nightmare.So, within two minutes, I knew I wasn't going to be giving this an eight (I already had a very good idea I wouldn't like this film, which is why it's taken me until now to watch it), but it became apparent shortly afterward that it wouldn't even be getting a six. It's just more of the same Hollywood tripe, aimed at the lowest common denominator. The plot is nonsensical, the script is absurd, and some of acting, especially by Bale, is utterly laughable. It's another of those mindless films where anything the writer wants to happen happens, regardless of internal logic; sometimes a fall will hurt, other times blasting a car through a brick wall will leave only a scratch. You get the gist. If you have a brain, save yourself a couple of hours and give this a miss.It's a real shame that this kind of baseless, silly farce is the standard film makers and audiences are holding themselves to these days. Shove in a cartoon villain, some stupid effects, a dumb chase or two, and you're Batman. If you want to see a comic-hero type action movie done well, watch The Mask of Zorro - it's infinitely better written and directed than this one.Despite that, I will give The Dark Knight a viewing, even though I know I am not going to be overly impressed. It can't be any worse than The Dark Knight Rises... can it?",1,2,9,4 October 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Yeahhhh! Graphics! Action scenes! AWESOOOME!
","Let's kick off with the score I've given it. 5/10. That's for the reasonable job with the comedy, design, and things not related to story and pacing (with the exception of Gollum and the cave scene). I am tired of saying 'The graphics are great, but...' I have rated it 1 here to reduce the average in order to reflect reality and not the fanboy love-in.I am not going to sugar-coat this film or give it a good review just because people tell me I should. I am sick to death of sheep. I don't care if this is Tolkien or Jackson or how much money it took to make the film. If it's bad, it's bad.Graphics count for nothing. The reason I watch a film is primarily for a great story and well written characters (I have to CARE about what is going on). I don't get dazzled by graphics anymore (if I ever did at all), and 3D action films do not make a film good. So right there is the problem with The Hobbit. The story is shallow and pretentious and cardboard. Let's run through why the film had me rolling my eyes throughout:<ul><li>The introduction is way too long.</li></ul>-The pacing is dire (and scenes that weren't in the book have been added).-One brainless action scene after another for no other reason than to eat screen time (because the book is 300 pages and they are trying to maximise profits by having 3 films at 3 hours each). Watching 2 rock monsters fight for minutes is not captivating or cool, it's boring.-Implausibility factor 10. I understand this is a fantasy. I understand that if everything was ultra realistic it would end up boring, but for heaven sake, that does not mean you can get away with what happens in this film. EVERY single scene shows something that would ordinarily kill someone. Fall down multiple ravines, battle 100's goblins with just a few men, rocks the size of cars flying at you... and no scratches, no deaths. It just doesn't work.-Lazy writing. You know you are witnessing a lazy-ass story when your heroes are saved at the last minute EVERY time in multiple scenes. Where does that leave us? It leaves us with all main characters intact and no dramatic tension. Every scene you see a massive rock crush a character you know they aren't dead. Every time you see them perilously close to the edge of a cliff, you know that even if they fall, they will be saved and/or survive. Further to this point, smaller problems exist such as Bilbo never handling a sword to suddenly taking on killer beasts like he has been to He-Man training school.-Cliché crap. The way Bilbo goes from being an outcast to being accepted is contrived and rushed and totally obvious. It just smacks of lazy cliché writing. The acting that goes with it is not good either. Kind of like 'I once said... you weren't one of us... OH how wrong I was!' *Roll eyes time*. Then you have the White Orc that Thorin said he had slain, and you just KNEW it was coming back at the end for some sort of showdown, didn't you? Talk about obvious. I blame the film for this because the scenes involved in the exposition were way too see-through... might as well have had Thorin wink at the camera! That brings me onto the whole 'Thorin dislikes Elves' angle, where you know the Elves are suddenly going to become important allies just so we can have a totally obvious and expected reversal. Wow, Thorin, you got Bilbo wrong and you got the Elves wrong too! DRAMA.-Lack of character development (Think Final Fantasy XII if you are a gamer). This was the stake through the heart of this film... Most of the dwarfs are completely redundant and I could not identify or even accept Bilbo. This was due partly to the lack of character development, partly to the script and partly to the actor. Same goes for Thorin except the scenes he is in feel more like a bad soap opera than they do a 'blockbuster' film.It is just dull and lifeless and stupid. You shouldn't do things just because you can. The LOTR trilogy for the most part had decent pacing, and it didn't do things too fast, too soon, or for the sake of it. The original trilogy suffers from some the complaints above AT TIMES, but nothing like The Hobbit does... The Hobbit is in a league of its own. I went to watch an engaging movie and I got a cartoon.The use of CGI is also glaringly obvious and fake; like with the prequels of Star Wars, when the movie cuts between humans and CGI blobs, your brain is onto it. Stop relying on CGI for everything. It's getting annoying, not to mention OLD. At least Jackson makes real sets so it isn't a total wash out.There is some real potential in this film and it is squandered; whether that's because Tolkien wrote a flawed book, whether it is because he wrote a book that doesn't take well to a feature length movie or whether it is because Jackson messed it up, that's what we ended up with.The Hobbit should have been 2 films, and making it 3 has been the final nail in the coffin.So, I am sat here mightily annoyed that once again graphics and self indulgent, completely pointless action scenes have trumped good storytelling and pacing.Of course, the film is still entertaining at times and the 3D visuals are fun, but for me it is a massive disappointment.Visuals can not MAKE a film, but when used like in The Hobbit, they sure as hell can break it.",1,1115,1732,16 December 2012
The Dark Knight," Nauseating and Preaching
","The biggest problem with this movie is that large parts are dedicated to a theme that has been done to death by the Left Wing Progressives of Hollywood. The absurd premise of this entire picture is that if you kill someone, no matter the justification, you yourself become the bad guy; it's cliché, it's worn out, and it's just not true. To someone who accepts this pseudo-philosophical garbage, the Dark Knight might have some sort of meaning, but to the rest of us, it's just a rather silly message that turns Batman into a gibbering do-gooder with both hands tied behind his back. I'd put my faith in David Cameron before the weak-ass Batman portrayed in this movie - and that's saying something.In the real world, a mass murdering psychopath would be hunted down and shot without any remorse whatsoever. No-one would care. There is no grey area here. IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME IN REAL LIFE. IT IS LAWFULLY ACCEPTABLE, especially when the said murderer is in the MIDDLE OF A RAMPAGE. Instead, in Nolan's fantasy world, killing a despicable killer (even to save others) is a no-no. Batman would much rather keep his 'morality' intact by sparing the killer time and time again - even at the risk of his own life. There are numerous examples of Leftist propaganda in this film, and silly scenes that serve only to give the liberals a warm heart, like the serious criminal who decides to throw away the detonator in order to save innocent lives. GIVE ME A BREAK. I'm not buying that cliché drivel. It's time for Hollywood to enter the real world. This film is an apologist for criminality.How on earth has this garbage managed to fool so many people? Given that the main theme of the film is utterly flawed, you won't be surprised to learn that almost all of it is. Like all of the films in the Nolan trilogy, there are WAY too many inconsistencies, plot holes, and totally unbelievable situations. Batman Returns is largely more realistic than this film is, and it wasn't even trying to be realistic. THAT should give you a good idea of how bad this is. At least the fast-cut editing has been toned down a little from Batman Begins.The biggest mistake this trilogy made was to meld the comic book craziness with real life logic in the hope of making a gritty, realistic Batman. News Flash: The comic Batman is totally and utterly unrealistic. You either create a decent comic film, or you take only elements that can generally work in the real world. This trilogy tried to create some kind of hybrid and, because of that, it falls flat on its face. But even the parts that should be believable regardless are done badly - like the police force. In order to make the joker a super-villain, Nolan made everyone else a super-moron. LAZY WRITING.There's not enough space to expand on every point I've made, and the film throws another curve ball at you before the end: The main law maker himself has a 100% reversal into a super-villain, because the Joker killed his wife hahaha. As you can no doubt tell, the script is completely bonkers. If you are going for realism, then don't insult my intelligence with this crap, Nolan.Imho, the Dark Knight is the strongest of the three films, but it's still a giant mess. My rating: 5/10.",1,7,24,5 October 2015

I didn't waste my money on buying the film or going to cinema, though- I listened to negative reviews here (and elsewhere), and worked out that the top ratings were from sheep. Again.Seriously... the ones giving this film over 5/10 are either brain-dead or have very low standards. Full of plot holes, silly dialogue, silly action scenes that go nowhere, and everything I have come to expect from most modern-day films.If you want believable characters and a decent story, forget this turkey.",1,9,22,7 January 2013
Heat," Rated High Because It's A Gangster Movie
","All you need to do is look at the top 100 films (and even top 10). Just look at how many are gangster movies or involve serious crime. The thing you have to understand is that these movies (nearly all of them, like Pulp Fiction) appeal to the masses and are alluring to the stupid (that includes scummy people, wannabe gangsters, and police haters). This is why they are always rated much higher than they should be, and why they are called masterpieces even though they include huge plot holes or have a ridiculous story. No genre on this planet gets a free pass like a gangster movie.Well, no, not from me it won't.This one is no different. 'Heat' is entertaining, but ridiculously flawed. The pacing is bad and it's overly long because of that. In one scene, an entire police squadron is wasted by a few criminals. It's so utterly laughable. Lazy storytelling and more moronic titillation for the mindless and easily pleased.There really isn't anything here to get worked up about or find intellectually stimulating. It's just your run-of-the-mill action / shoot 'em up. Al Pacino can act, but we knew that already. If you want a quick bit of entertainment on a bored Sunday, this is the film for you. Otherwise, don't bother.5/10",5,2,10,13 August 2015
