The New World," Musical Take on 'First Year in Jamestown'
","Can the story of Captain Smith, Pocahontas, et.al. be presented in the fashion of 'Last Year in Marienbad'? Terrence Malick (of 'Days of Heaven,' yup) seems to channel Resnais in 'The New World' he wrote and directed. It's a bizarre, puzzling, beautiful, and maddening film, sure to end up on both the year's best and worst lists. And, one of the strangest things about this strange movie is its soundtrack. After James Horner's name appears on the screen as the composer, there follows 2 1/2 hours (doesn't anyone make 90-minute movies anymore?) of Mozart and Wagner. Now, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 floating over the muck of the settlement and the broad vistas of the Naturals (as Christopher Plummer refers to the Indians) may be anachronistic, but we are well used to KV 488 from a dozen movies, including - alas - 'Way of the Gun,' 'Good Riddance,' and 'Misunderstood.' No, what's interesting about the soundtrack of 'The New World' is how the Prelude to 'Das Rheingold' is used - at length and significantly. Just as the film itself is good/bad, there is a contrast here in the appropriateness of the soundtrack. Wagner's unstoppable ascending modulation makes no sense at all in the middle of the movie, but the very beginning is something else. As the settlers' ships approach the coast of this new and strange world, water is everywhere... and there swells that grand 'Creation music' so well, so right. Underwater glimpses of young native women swimming just reinforce the connection, needlessly. Studio notes, by the way, identify soundtrack portions not written by Horner as 'non-original music.' That be Mozart and Wagner...:)<ul><li>Janos</li></ul>",7,0,2,18 January 2006
Frost_Nixon," 'Frost/Nixon' - not what you think
","I almost skipped 'Frost/Nixon,' and I am glad I didn't. It's eminently worthwhile, one of the year's few films that deserves to be seen.My reluctance had to do with the expectation that it will offer nothing new to somebody who lived through the Watergate years and saw the Frost interviews (although remembering surprisingly little of them).Ron Howard's film is anything but ho-hum - if anything it's a bit too gussied up to be exciting. There is an element of discernible manipulation of the audience, but mostly it works, and you don't long resist it.The (relatively) unsung hero of the film besides Howard, Frank Langella's tremendous Nixon, and Michael Sheen's excellent Frost is the screenwriter: once again Peter Morgan (of 'The Last King of Scotland' and 'The Queen') engages mind and heart, and doesn't let go. Sam Rockwell's James Reston, Jr. and Oliver Platt's Bob Zelnick (Frost's two collaborators) are outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's Nixon-worshipping Jack Brennan is the actor's best work in a long time.Morgan and Howard manage to make the viewer think constantly of another criminal President without saying or showing anything overt - they just let history, past and present, speak.I had a strange, uncomfortable thought watching 'Frost/Nixon': even if some future film 'humanizes' (not excuses) Bush the way Nixon comes through this one, W. would still remain a malevolent midget against Nixon's accomplishments and actual *brain*. How far we have fallen.",Null,71,103,11 December 2008
Howl's Moving Castle," A unique masterpiece
","Dislocation is rarely a pleasant experience, but when the title object of 'Howl's Moving Castle' first comes into view, its visual, historical, stylistic ambiguity is downright thrilling.Master animator Hayao Miyazaki (of 'Spirited Away' and 'Princess Mononoke') once again takes the breath away with his bizarre imagination and richly painted scenes. The enormous lumbering Gothic/sci-fi structure looming over the late-19th century Alsatian (!) cityscape reminds one of Hieronymus Bosch, of Pieter Breughel, of Friedensreich Hundertwasser, and yet remains resolutely unique - it is Miyazaki, and no one else.Neither a Hollywood computer-animated film nor a typical Japanese anime, Miyazaki's work is a phenomenon onto itself.As a movie, 'Castle' ('Hauru no ugoku shiro'), at 2 hours' running time, is about a half an hour too long. As a work of art, a visual sensation, it's over much too quickly, although it is guaranteed to continue to run in one's mind.Adopting British author Diana Wynne Jones novel, Miyazaki tells the story of Howl, a terrifying and yet insecure wizard/demon; young milliner Sophie, who is turned into a 90-year-old woman by the Witch of the Waste; Calcifer, a fiery little demon, who powers the castle; Markl, Howl's young apprentice; and the mystical Madame Suliman.Heaven forfend that such a work be dubbed ('Spirited Away' was different - and superior - in the subtitled version), but Miyazaki admirers John Lassater and Pete Docter of Pixar have put heart and soul into the English version, and they succeeded. The voice talent for 'Castle' is extraordinary: Jean Simmons is old Sophie (the film's main character), Emily Mortimer is the pre-curse Sophie, Laren Bacall makes the evil witch almost lovable, Billy Crystal is Calcifer (not overdoing it), and Christian Bale is Howl.For 'Spirited Away' fans, 'Castle' is a must; for those unfamiliar with Miyazaki, this is a splendid introduction to the work of a creative genius.",10,3,4,27 May 2005
The Other Boleyn Girl," A Pretty Tudor Thriller
","First, an easy quiz (which you're going to get wrong): How many wives did King Henry VIII have? Answer at the end of this article, but why not try to figure it out before looking? Oh, too late, you already did...And now, a question: Did Henry VIII always look like Charles Laughton, with the heft and bulges of the most memorable actor in the role of the monarch? The truth is that both the king and Laughton looked a lot better when they were young. Instead of a fat, dissolute Henry, there was back in the early 16th century a trimmer, more handsome king, who soon ate and married too much. That Henry, not the famous picture of him by Holbein, must have looked like Eric Bana. And so, in Philippa Gregory's Hollywood-compliant but terrifically entertaining 'The Other Boleyn Girl,' it is Bana - from the non-green scenes of the 2003 'Hulk' - who rules, while the real-life plain-to-ugly Boleyn girls are brought to you by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary). It is to their credit and, especially, that of director Justin Chadwick that you buy all these prettifications, all or most of author Gregory's romantic liberties with the story, and enjoy the movie thoroughly. Chadwick is new to feature films, but he has solid credits in TV, especially with the recent magnificent BBC 'Bleak House,' as fine a realization of Dickens as you'll find anywhere. And, speaking of the BBC, if you want to see a less 'pretty,' more substantial version of Gregory's novel, dig up the 2003 TV version of 'The Other Boleyn Girl,' with Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone; those two run rings around the smirking Portman and the too-angelic Johansson. The exalted Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay - as well as for the superior 'The Queen' and 'The Last King of Scotland' - and an in-depth research project is just waiting for the right scholar to compare Morgan's 'Boleyn' script with Philippa Lowthorpe's for the TV version.So, with novelist, script writer, director, and a darn fine yarn to begin with, the new film has much going for it. The supposedly well-known story of Henry's marriage to Anne and dalliance with Mary is told well, bringing into focus a great many sub-stories of background machinations by a power-hungry family using the two sisters as bait. If at first you must overcome the challenge of seeing Anne Boleyn behind Portman's glitz and 21st-century 'tude, by the time the character reaches the catastrophic comeuppance for her (and her family's) scheming, Portman comes close to the touchstone established by Jodhi May. Quiz answer: Two. Surely you think six, but that's not right. Four of Henry's marriages were annulled, which means officially they never existed. Although Gregory's book doesn't deal with this tricky question, you can take the information to the bank.",7,3,7,1 March 2008
Match Point," Woody at 70: Opera and Tennis
","Woody Allen's new film 'Match Point' has five large themes, three of which are among my principal passions: opera, tennis, London, murder, and a thesis that sheer, dumb luck is not only the origin of life, but also its most decisive element.Except for a bit of a sag halfway through it, 'Match Point' is one Allen's best films, a significant claim to make considering his involvement in the making of about as many movies as his age - an amazing accomplishment for Allen Konigsberg of Brooklyn, born on Dec. 1, 1935.'Match Point,' about the spectacular rise and 'Crimes and Misdemeanors'-like un-fall of a young tennis pro (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, in a career-making performance), opens and closes with Caruso singing 'Una furtiva lagrima,' it contains a virtually nonstop series of opera excerpts, and its long climactic scene is accompanied by the finale of Verdi's 'Otello.' Why the switch from jazz to opera? 'The story is operatic,' Allen has said. 'It deals with the kinds of things that opera is so often about: love and lust, passion and jealousy, betrayal and tragedyand, of course, the confluence of fate and luck.' Always excelling in casting (even in his many weaker films), Allen has outdone himself in 'Match Point' - Scarlett Johansson, Emily Mortimer, Matthew Goode, Brian Cox, Penelope Wilton, and others all turn in topnotch performances, almost all playing characters that are different from previous movie (if not stage) roles.Glory be: 'Match Point' has no whining, no Woody-isms, it may be fully enjoyed by those who have developed a kind of allergy to Allen's increasingly bothersome mannerisms over the years. Almost uniquely among his films, this has neither him nor a 'Woody Allen character.' The tennis is so-so, but London (a new venue for New York-bound Allen) is marvelously real and alive. All this and lots of Caruso - what a treat!",8,9,15,5 December 2005
Knocked Up," Knocked together
","If this be nepotism, bring it on! 'Knocked Up' director Jeff Apatow gave his wife, Leslie Mann, and their two young daughters, Iris and Maude Apatow, important supportive roles, and the three pretty much walk away with the movie.San Francisco native Mann plays Debbie, a prim-proper-and-funny control-freak wife, channeling an anachronistic presence from the 'Fifties, the two kids are her spirited and uncontrolled children; add a loving but unhappy husband (Paul Rudd), and there you have the 'model family' against which the unusual romance of Ben (Seth Rogen) and Alison (Katherine Heigl) takes place.Ben is the most unlikely leading man of recent times, never mind a romantic lead: he is a penniless, unkempt, overweight young man with a kind of charm only drinking (or pot-smoking) buddies could appreciate. Alison is gorgeous, successful, with the relentless sheen Heigl has been radiating with unvaried artificiality in 61 episodes (so far) of 'Grey's Anatomy' as Izzie Stevens.So what do Ben and Alison have in common? The pregnancy referred to in the movie's indelicate title. The unhappy embryo brings together not only the two unlikely lovers, but also their respective, far-distant tribes. Ben's grossly juvenile would-be webmaster playmates and Alison's should-be proper family (Debbie & Co.) are squeezed together in a variety of ways. Yes, it's a non-starter basic plot, and the surprise is that the movie actually goes to some distance in search of some coherence.Invariably linked with Apatow's '40 Year Old Virgin,' 'Knocked Up' has mercifully less exaggerated physical comedy than the former, but the same sense of delight in the absurd, even if Apatow goes a long way at times to find it truthiness in the ludicrous. A big plus: mostly appealing (but realistic) characters, easy to care about, with their faults and warts and all.The result is rather pleasant: a mostly funny, occasionally charming, steadily foul-mouthed, frequently well-written, otherwise downright stupid comedy, enjoyable in spite of its unaccountably overblown length of over two hours. It would have made a real good hour-long TV sitcom. Also, 'Knocked Up' has a first-class score by Joe Henry and Loudon Wainwright III.",7,3,8,31 May 2007
The Bourne Ultimatum," Ultimate 'Bourne'
","First and foremost, speaking as no fan of the genre, 'The Bourne Ultimatum' is a breathtaking, virtuoso, superb action movie.Secondly, it is a silly malarky of cartoonish super-hero stuff.Thirdly, the film carries a complex, important point, about crime-fighters turning into criminals themselves. No reference is made to Abu Ghraib or the Executive Branch's outrageous domestic assaults on constitutional rights, none is necessary.So, the latest in the 'Bourne' series, in the hands of Paul Greengrass (of the 2004 'Bourne Supremacy' and last year's 'United 93'), is a significant achievement, perhaps held back but not actually diminished by the unavoidable excesses of the genre.'Breathtaking' above is meant both as a complimentary adjective and a description of the physical sensation: for more than an hour from the first frame, the viewer seemingly holds his breath, pushed back against the chair by the force of relentless, globe-trotting, utterly suspenseful action. There is no letup, no variation in the rhythm and pull of the film, and yet it never becomes monotonous and tiresome the way some kindred music videos do after just a couple of minutes.Oliver Wood's in-your-face cinematography is making the best of Tony Gilroy's screenplay from Robert Ludlum's 1990 novel (which doesn't stack up well against the 'Bourne Identity,' written a decade earlier).Matt Damon is once again the inevitable, irreplaceable Bourne, the deadliest of fantasy CIA agents, this time taking on the entire agency in search of his identity, his past, and the mysterious agency program that has turned him into a killing machine. Nothing like his quietly heroic Edward R. Murrow, the always-marvelous David Strathairn is the nasty top agency official, pitched against Bourne in trying to hide some illegal 'take-no-prisoners' policies and brutal procedures.Joan Allen plays what appears to be the Good Cop against Strathairn's Bad One. And, there is Julia Stiles as the agent once again coming to Bourne's aid; a combination of Greengrass' direction and Stiles acting results in a surprising impact by a mostly silent character, her lack of communication and blank expression more intriguing than miles of dialogue.So good is 'The Bourne Ultimatum' that it gets away with the old one-man-against-the-world bit, this time stretched to ridiculous excesses, as Bourne defies constraints of geography, time, gravity... and physics in general. (Can you fly backwards with a car from the top of a building? Why not - it looks great.) All this 'real-world' magic - leaping from country to country in seconds, to arrive at some unknown location exactly as, when, and how needed - outdoes special-effect and superhero cartoon improbabilities. And yet, only a clueless pedant would allow 'facts' interfere with the entertainment-based ecstasy of the Bourne fantasy.",8,154,268,27 July 2007
Burn After Reading," Tonight We Laugh
","Norman Cousins would have loved the Coen Brothers' 'Burn After Reading.' The late great Saturday Review editor had treated his illness with Marx Brothers movies, having 'made the joyous discovery that 10 minutes of genuine belly laughter had an anesthetic effect and would give me at least two hours of pain-free sleep.'I have never felt healthier than after 96 minutes of explosive and grateful laughter at the 'Burn' screening, also marveling at the array of British-stage caliber acting from 'Fargo'-invoking Frances McDormand, witchy-icy Tilda Swinton, a more-manic-than-ever John Malkovich, and a dozen major players, such as J.K. Simmons as the deadpan CIA boss and Richard Jenkins as the former Greek Orthodox priest, now running an upscale gym.Others may lead the cast list with George Clooney and Brad Pitt, but to me, their performances were just a bit on the self-conscious side, trying too hard. At any rate, it's a great cast, and while the plot might have turned into a dud in somebody else's treatment, the Coen Brothers' writing is hilarious, their zingers deadly.A critic, probably with bad digestion, has decried this 'very black comedy set in a blanched, austere-looking Washington, D.C.  an uninspiring and uncomfortable place in which everyone betrays everyone else, and the emotional tone veers from icy politeness to spitting rage and back again.' If I had a chance to think, instead of enjoying 'Burn,' I would have contemplated Molière and Evelyn Waugh, their comedies of manners, psychological insight, and unbridled great humor.Yes, there are betrayals (none better than the totally unexpected one at the end of the film), and there is rage, but all contained within a glorious bubble of writing-directing-acting excellence. 'Burn' grips and holds, surprises and entertains, it is a virtuoso piece.Don't be misled by the a 'action-trailer' on TV, saturating the airwaves; it says nothing of the film. Malkovich punching Pitt over a compromising CD of spook stuff is not at the heart of this - the McDormand character's pursuit of cosmetic surgery is, what with her self-examination, a lengthy session with the surgeon (Jeffrey DeMunn, in a brilliant turn), her desperate quest for a way to pay for it. Funny and going deep at the same time, 'Burn' presents a series of character studies (hence the thought of Molière), in the context of mannered yet true social interactions (Waugh).Skip descriptions of the plot, reject self-righteous denunciations of smart skepticism and charming evil, go and wallow in life-affirming laughter.",8,159,298,11 September 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A Handsome Runt of a Phoenix
","The phoenix of legends died in flames and then rose from the ashes to new life. 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' does no such thing. It neither croaks nor soars. No. 5 in the Potter series is visually spectacular, on the whole entertaining, but it's almost painfully single- and simple-minded in its appeal to a strictly juvenile audience. The story of Good vs. Authority (Imelda Staunton's spirited but ridiculous caricature of a Margaret Thatcher stick figure, zaftig as she may look here in ill-fitting clothes) is not only primitive, it's dangerous: even children need to know that real Evil is not that cardboard-cutout obvious, that Snidely Whiplash not a Macbeth makes. J.K. Rowling's writing is on the lazy side here.And yet, strangely in case of such a youth-oriented film, it's a dark, scary story, not only with the continued (escalated?) all-around torture of Harry, but with the Ministry of Magic takeover of Hogwarts School playing out as totalitarian steamroller, a kind of '1984' without the dance numbers.But first, director David Yates, cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, production designer Stuart Craig, and the throng of special-effects folks from ILM, MPC, Framestore CFC, Warner Bros., etc., etc. should get major kudos for one of the best-looking movies around. For every dumb broom-riding scene, there are some unforgettable visuals of majestic vistas, unending, rich interiors, a cataclysmic cascade of glass structures, and so on. A truly handsome production. Small touches, such as the demonstration that even wizards need Oyster Card on the Underground, are enjoyable.The core cast comes through well: Daniel Radcliffe could easily do Harry in his sleep, but he is very much awake, Emma Watson's Hermione has some new angles (she allows herself a small thrill in facing danger), Rupert Grint's Ron is reliably innocuous.Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is believably magical, Alan Rickman's Snape is once again on the cusp of malignant-looking beneficence (and we do learn something interesting from his past), but not all is well. Ralph Fiennes' noseless Voldemort is annoying, that magnificent duo of Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson get screen time of a few seconds, and Helena Bonham Carter's deranged turn is brief and rather ludicrous. It's actually more fun to watch lesser-known actors making the best of their moments at the periphery.There is a lot to see, a lot to enjoy in 'Phoenix,' but it's without a center, substance, heart.",6,3,7,10 July 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman: Departure & Arrival
","Quirky, entertaining, and at times wonderful, Charlie Kaufman's scripts for 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' were harbingers of a great talent. His new film is a step up: it's beyond fun and promise. There are glimpses here of the compelling brilliance, complexity and lasting impact of a Tom Stoppard, a Dennis Potter. Kaufman has arrived.But first, there are a couple of obstacles to overcome. The first is the title. 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is neither good marketing nor something that makes sense. Just get over it. (And remember that both 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being' and 'The Vertical Rays of the Sun' triumphed over their awkward, heliotropic handles.)Second, disregard the advertising that punches up the science-fiction/Matrix-like theme of erasing memories of a relationship. Just auto-erase all the negative expectations that come up as the result. 'Eternal Sunshine' is not about special-effects razzle-dazzle; it's about people. The writing, Michel Gondry's direction, gripping performances by Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet combine to make it a treasure.
Sitting in the theater, not wanting the film to end, I remembered the major squirming through the endless video game of 'The Return of the King,' the obscene, sacrilegious sado-masochism of 'The Passion of the Christ.' Those two box-office wonders don't have a glimmer of the humanity and excellence of 'Eternal Sunshine' - let's just hope that it gets an audience.",Null,0,1,17 March 2004
Inside Man," Spike Goes Hollywood. Again. Rejoice!
","'Inside Man' is great fun. As you must know from the extensive advertising campaign and marketing blitz, it's the story of a bank robbery, which is not really a bank robbery. What? Who? Why? See the film, and find out the somewhat disappointing answer. But getting there, for two hours, is entertaining and fun.But no more than that. Yes, you've got Spike Lee's caustic humor and a few fascinating characters, but it's not a thinking person's thriller - just a thriller, albeit one that makes bathroom breaks difficult to find.Denzel Washington, playing the chief police negotiator, is at his best, as the very human, street-smart, and persistent detective. Something is wrong with Jodie Foster's high-powered 'arranger,' something not quite right in her portrayal of the mysteriously powerful woman, who fixes things, at a price.First-time script writer Russell Gewirtz does well, Matthew Libatique's cinematography is superb; he is responsible for Lee's 'She Hate Me' as well as for 'Gothika' and the 'Phone Booth,' and he does a simple-and-effective job here that's admirable.PS: Two first-class movies now have come and gone, disappearing almost instantly. Catch up with them on DVD: Tommy Lee Jones' 'The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada' and Sidney Lumet's 'Find Me Guilty.' Yes, the latter just opened, but it's going away already. Such a shame. Both are significantly more substantial than 'Inside Man,' which will rake it in.",5,3,9,21 March 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Idi Amin, Entertainer
","Life, unlike bad movies, is seldom obvious. In life, murderous dictators don't appear - especially at first - as mustache-twirling Snidley Whiplash figures, cackling madly (although Mussolini came close). The scary truth about monsters is that they are three-dimensional beings, not cardboard cutouts, who just kill a lot of people, but otherwise put their pants on one leg at a time, like you and I, and that makes them so much scarier than if they came from another planet.In the best film of the 'dictator genre,' Oliver Hirschbiegel's brilliant 'Downfall,' Hitler appears as a man who is kind to his dog and his secretary (roughly in that order), and the impact of the work is all the greater as we witness what a 'real person' is capable of doing. In Luis Puenzo's 'The Official Story,' Pinochet's reign of terror is depicted through a single act of violence, as a door is slammed on Norma Aleandro's hand; the effect is stunning and 'real.' In the hands of a less talented director, the story of Idi Amin would be told against mountains of skulls and bones left behind by Uganda's mad ruler in the 1970s. (His total toll is estimated at 300,000.) In Kevin Macdonald's complex, intelligent, gripping 'The Last King of Scotland,' more than half of the two-hour film subtly implies, hints at the dark forces underneath normalcy while 'life goes on.' And so, having established real contact with the audience, a jolly and seductive Forest Whitaker then takes our breath away as the mask comes off, and his Amin reaches out from the screen for your throat.Macdonald - whose previous works are documentaries, including the Oscar-winning 'One Day in September,' about the Munich Olympics terrorist incident - looks at Amin through the eyes of a young Scottish doctor (James McAvoy), a well-meaning, honest humanitarian slowly seduced by the Scots-loving Amin, who appoints him his personal doctor and then adviser.The McAvoy character is fictional (although Amin did have a Scottish doctor), coming from Giles Foden's novel of the same name, but just about everything else in the film is based on fact - so much so that some documentary footage is smoothly integrated into the film. And yet, what's important and outstanding about 'Last King' is that just as a painting can surpass a photograph in presenting reality, this film conveys the seduction and horror of a brutal dictatorship indirectly, subtly, unexpectedly.Unexpected - and welcome - are the many flashes of humor, both Whitaker (dictator with personality) and McAvoy (eager pup of a doctor with overactive hormones) making the best of it. The tone is set in the opening sequence, as the frustrated, suppressed young Dr. Garrigan spins a small globe, swearing repeatedly that he will move to the first spot ('the first!') where he points when the globe stops. The first spot turns out to be Canada. McAvoy/Garrigan takes one look, hesitates... and spins again. And so to Uganda...The linear, freely-flowing story-telling is masterful, taking us from the small village where Dr. Garrigan comes to do good and ends up doing well through a chance meeting with Amin, to Kampala, much court intrigue and colorful depravity (even as the fate of a nation is at stake), and eventually to Entebbe.Fun and games, authentic scenery (the film was shot in Uganda), subtlety, psychology, a heart-pounding scene at Entebbe (after the hijacking, but before the Israeli rescue), nudity, sex, violence, harrowing questions about 'what would you do,' and all - 'Last King' is a wonderful compendium of facts and greater truths. Also, a hell of a good movie.",8,148,168,28 September 2006
Casino Royale," What hand will 007 x 21 give you?
","The twenty-first (21!) James Bond flick is expertly directed, well acted, beautifully photographed. It is solid entertainment. So why only seven stars? Because it is entertainment and no more. Before hurling words such as 'snob' and 'curmudgeon' at me, consider that it's entirely possibly - and highly desirable - for food (and movies) to be both tasty and nutritious. 'Casino Royale' is excellent, glorious... popcorn. The reason to bring this up right at the top is that 'Casino Royale' hints at substance, of character development, of depth - but it doesn't deliver. The new Bond, Daniel Craig, is more complex than most of the macho cardboard figures of the past. He has some 'issues,' some vulnerabilities, and he falls in love the way no flashy establishment killer should. (Speaking of killers, British intelligence is using the new film for recruiting, while denying that agents, of any rank, have a 'license to kill.') Twenty-one in the series of films is not the only impressive figure. It's been a half a century-plus since Ian Fleming wrote 'Casino Royale,' his first James Bond novel, and 40 years since the appearance of the first film version. You know when a series has 'legs' when you start repeating titles.Four decades is a long time. With a changing world, there is a different script, involving - of course - terrorists. And those who finance them. You finance terrorists by selling weapons of mass destruction, or, once Bond catches you or blows up your weapons, by playing Texas Holdem at the Casino Royale. (Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are responsible for the screenplay.) Martin Campbell (of two Zorro movies and of 'Vertical Limit') directed 'Casino Royale' smoothly and expertly, but unable to overcome instances of banality in the script. Campbell is also perhaps partially responsible (along with producers) for the 144-minute length of the film, which you may regard as 'getting your money's worth' or as excessive, resulting in bang-bang scenes that go on and on.The women of the new Bond are less pulchritudinous than the model/bunnies of the past, and have more soul... up to a point. Eva Green, Caterina Murino, and Ivana Milicevic are entertaining and forgettable, even as the film itself is. The great Judi Dench, as M, is great indeed, presenting a memorable character with marvelous economy. Giancarlo Giannini, as Mathis, is a class act, as always. The new super-villain is a Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen, playing Le Chiffre. He is scary enough, especially when - rather routinely - a smidgen of blood is discharged from his eye for no discernible reason.Bond's Aston Martin has fewer visible gadgets than those of the old times, but its glove compartment is conveniently furnished with a defibrillator. Just as there is an invariable rule in the theater that if you show a gun in act one, somebody will be shot in act two, if there is a defibrillator in your glove compartment, somebody's heart is going to stop (temporarily, one hopes). However, there will be no spoiler here about the identity of the victim or the outcome of the medical procedure. If there is one thing you don't want to do with a James Bond movie is tell who wins in the end.",7,1,3,16 November 2006
The Simpsons Movie," What a Bargain!
","These are the simple facts: 'The Simpsons' is a TV series - with 400 episodes over 18 years - not on special cable, not at a premium. It's free.'The Simpsons Movie' requires paid attendance. It is not free.Who would you think in all of Hollywood would handle a 'situation' like this by making a clean breast of it. Or even taunt the audience, foolish enough to pay for something available for free? But behold, it's good old, dumb, obnoxious, lovable Homer Simpson himself, looking down from the movie screen, jabbing a finger at the audience and yelling: 'SUCKERS!' You can't help sharing his delight, laughing at your own gullibility.But are you really being taken advantage of? Not by a long shot. 'The Simpsons Movie' is well worth the price of admission (if not the outrageous prices at the concession stand). For Simpsons fans, the movie is nirvana; for the unfortunate rest of humanity, at least a therapeutic exercise in extreme giggles. ('Others' include the considerable portion of the fan base that dropped the viewing habit on Sundays.) And yet, even from the viewpoint of this obvious fan, the movie doesn't have the punch of some of the best TV episodes. There are two reasons for that, one obvious, one complex. It's easy to see how the belly-shaking impact of a half-hour program (minus commercials), such as the family's trips to Japan and South America, could not be replicated over an ad-free 90 minutes. (Actually, the movie sneaks in a commercial, and then gloats over it.) The other issue is a matter of speculation. Interview after interview with the Simpsons creators and cast stressed how much more work went into the movie than into TV episodes, preparations for the film spreading over years. They might have tried a bit too hard, instead of the easy, elegant charm of the best of the series.Beyond such belly-gazing, the story of Homer's environmental crime and attempts to rescue Springfield from the consequences (EPA acting as Homeland Security on steroids) begins splendidly, the first half of the film bouncing from laugh to laugh. Things slow down a bit in the second half, but at no point does the 'Simpsons Movie' justify giving director David Silverman, series creator Matt Groening, and Supreme Simpsonite James L. Brooks a wedgie. (Although it would be fun, ha-haaa!)",Null,0,2,27 July 2007
Atonement," A runt of a great flick
","'Look,' a psychologist tells the man on the couch, 'making you happy is out of the question, but I can give you a compelling narrative for your misery.'The Mankoff cartoon appears in the same current issue of the New Yorker in which Anthony Lane drags 'Atonement' over the coals, taking it to task for not living up to his expectations: http://tinyurl.com/37xu3a.I too had some problems with the film, but found Joe Wright's direction and Christopher Hampton's script combining for a thoroughly compelling narrative for the misery of characters, an involving story realized by an outstanding cast.In fact, against a dismal bunch of competitors in the end-of-year 'big releases,' I found in 'Atonement' only the second four-star movie of 2007. It's firmly No. 2, however, against 'Away from Her' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0491747/) because its too obvious manipulation of feelings while Sarah Polley's brilliant work is totally straightforward and honest, no strings seen anywhere.My third and fourth choices are 'Easter Promises' and 'The Bourne Ultimatum' - two razzle-dazzle examples of guilty pleasure. And, it is true, I missed a good number of screenings (life keeps interfering with the movies), so I may well be missing good candidates from the top of my Top Ten.",8,0,2,7 December 2007
