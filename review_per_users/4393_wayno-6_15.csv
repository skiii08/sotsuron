Requiem for a Dream," Not as bad as Pearl Harbour
","Not as bad as Pearl Harbour, but just as poorly acted.  Music was bad, audio was bad.  Very strong sexual scenarios.The audio was so bad on this (I rented it as a pay per view) that even cranking my tv set up full blast, and augmenting it with my stereo, the dialogue was impossible to follow. Whomever did the audio production on this should be shot! (and yes I checked another viewing, and the audio was STILL bad!)The music was absolutely dreadful.  Music is supposed toenhance a feeling - or set a mood or tone.  The music stood out like one big sore ARM!  (err I hope I didn't give away too much of the lack of plot!)The movie describes the downward spiral of 4 individuals, each addicted to their drug of choice.  More time should have been spent on character development, and less on trying to be and 'artsy' film.This movie would NOT survive in the mainstream at all. It has little to offer in the way of entertainment value.While not as bad as 'Trainspotting' - If the attempt was to show the down side of addiction.  This could have succeeded if time were spent on character development, which was close to non-existent.I guess I just don't get 'artsy' films.  Glad I only paid $4 for this dullard.rated no stars

Unbreakable," Unbelievably poor acting/plot
","Bruce Willis should NOT make pictures that require serious character acting...Poor direction, a plot that made absolutely NO sense --scenes that did not advance the plot --I kept looking at my watch waiting for this piece of cinematic blunder to be over....Waynorated 1/2 star out of 5",1,3,6,31 October 2001
Citizen Kane," Confusing movie
","over 100 scene transitions in the first 5 minutes (yes I DID count them!) of the movie made it hard to sort out anything that followed -- the movie just made no sense at all -- I got so lost trying to follow all the scene transitions (and they were very poorly done) distracted from anything this movie could potentially be.Acting aside, the director and cinematographer should have been shot...",1,9,36,30 October 1999
Notting Hill," brutally borish british film...
","I saw Notting Hill as in inflight movie - which addmittedly is NOT the best place to watch much of anything. (Prior to the movie, we were 'treated' to an epidose of 'Frasier' (no thanks, I'd rather have hemmeroids!)  Then the first epidose of 'I Dream of Jeanie' (in living black and white)What the heck I had 2 hours to kill.They managed to make a brutally boorish, British film starring Hugh Grant, and Julia Roberts.  Bad Dialogue, Bad plot (plot?  what plot?), bad acting - all combined to make this 2 hour movie, seem like 10 hours long.  (and I only signed up for a 5 hour flight!)Thankfully the movie came to and end, and so did my flight, about 20 minutes later....Wayno",1,3,10,23 September 1999
Hugo," Okay one time Red Box Rental
","MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.Was a decent one time rental from red box.I'd give it a 1 - 1.5If I had known it was a Scorsese film, I wouldn't have bothered. It Ended poorly -- did a lot of character development, expected a terrific ending, only to once again be disappointed.Did NOT respect the audience, in my humble opinion.Plot points went un-resolved at the end of the film, I was left wondering why it was in there in the first place.Ben Kingsley did a good job, with a poor script and odd English language usage.Wayno",1,7,13,22 March 2012
Being John Malkovich," Watching this movie is about as painful as dentistry without
","Watching this movie is about as painful as dentistry without anesthesia.  Watching paint dry would have been more exciting.They should have made this picture 'Being Bill Clinton!' Now that would have been exciting.  But then, I guess it would have been an 'X' rated picture.This movie vac-packed hard!Wayno",1,5,12,21 November 2000
Pearl Harbor," A 3 hour tour -- of a sappy love story wrapped around WWII.
","Synopsis:  A 3 hour tour -- of a sappy love story wrapped around WWII.This movie was WAY too long - about an 1 1/2 HOURS too long!The plot was tediously slow in developing the sappy love story.  I found myself constantly checking my watch -- waiting - for them to either advance the plot, or tell me more about a character.Some of the scenes at the bombing, looked too much like 'Titanic' -- WAY too much schmultz (sacharin or artificial emotions).There were some good scenes, to be sure.  But the dialogue, acting, and plot really got in the way of this movie.I personally felt, 'TORA!  TORA!  TORA!' was a much better historical perspective of this chapter of American History.Rated 3 reels out of 5Wayno",4,0,0,25 May 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Confusing, drawn out plot....
",okay in fairness -- I have now watched this all the way through -- it made little sense -- they never explained what the two towers are -- plot lacked cohesion...dialogue very hard to understand -- again had to rely 100% on closed captioning.  Way too much dependence on CGI (Computer Generated Images) to carry the story.Wayno,3,0,1,11 January 2004
Clash of the Titans," Good Special effects despite some 3D hiccups
","I was pretty familiar with the plot of the story, having seen the original in 1981, by special effects Master, Ray Harryhausen.The 2010 remake (in 3D) was pretty spectacular.Unlike Avatar which relied heavily on the 3D to carry the story, Clash of the Titans (2010) used 3D to enhance the story, not carry it.But unlike Avatar, Clash of the Titans (2010) has some 3D hiccups. Especially noticeable are scenes, where the object spreads to cover the left or right edge of the screen. (Thanks Wil!) The 3D image isn't quite so good. James Cameron, was obviously aware of this when he made Avatar. It had no 3D hiccups.Despite that, Clash is an excellent film for the emerging 3D industry. The special effects were expected, and they were well done.One wonders what Ray Harryhausen (retired) could do with these toys, which didn't exist 30 years ago?",6,0,1,11 April 2010
2001: A Space Odyssey," Quite possibly, the best Sci-Fi Space Epoch ever made.
","I couldn't think of a better way to usher in the new millennium, then to watch Turner Classic Movie's presentation of this epoch space classic.  I have probably seen 2001 twenty (20) times since its release in 1968.  It was 3 years in the making (1965-1968) - and contained 250 special effects. 
Remarkably, its STILL stands the test of time.  I appreciate the fact, ) that Kubrick did NOT insult my intelligence, by having them open a window to the vacuum of space, and shoot ray guns  at each other, complete with sound effects (see also, Flash Gordon).  2001, is #22 on the American Film Institute's, top 100 films of all time.  And rightly so.This film legitimised Science Fiction.  It is, in my opinion, historically more significant then the 'Star Bores' trilogy that ensued since 2001 was released.  Face facts:  without 2001, there would be no 'Star Bores!'I've seen the 'Star Bores' epochs only twice.  All the glitter and saccharin schmaltz is a bit much!  The problem with 'Star Bores', in my opinion, is two fold:  the 'contact lens' character depth (or is that Mc Donald's hamburger tomato slice thickness?), and  secondarily the use of special effects to take the place of any real acting or plot development.   People frequently confuse glitz with real acting, and plot development.I still take delight in watching Kubrick's timeless classic, 30+ years after its release. The only other film that does this for me, is the classic 'Wizard of Oz', which is my personal favourite -- I've seen it probably close to 100 times, since I was born in 1952!  The message is timeless.It is unknown whether Arthur Clarke's vision of an orbiting space station as depicted in his book, will ever be a reality, but I think Clarke showed remarkable  visionary prowess in his novel, which if memory serves me correctly, was written in the 1940's.Wayno",10,0,2,3 January 2001
Avatar," Long but a decent movie
","Rated lower due to length:Spoilers Ahead! You may want to bow out now!Clocking in at just under 3 hours, 'Avatar' seems to miss the one salient point known by Preachers everywhere: 'The brain can absorb, ONLY what the seat can endure!' The movie, despite its length, is a good watch, though the 3D at times, seemed more a novelty, then an enhancement to the story. More on this later.The plot however, seemed to be a derivative. It was somewhere between 'Dances with Wolves' meets 'The Matrix' and 'The Terminator' with a sappy love story thrown in for good measure.Not particularly original, but when have the offerings from Hollywood been original? (Yes that's a rhetorical question!) I was surprised to be honest, that the CGI (Computer Generated Images) were that good! I really couldn't tell where the GGI (animation) begin, and what was real. I figured the CGI would carry the story. In fact it enhanced it.What didn't enhance it however, was the 3D. Besides making you wear the clunky glasses, it did give me a headache. I expected this, remembering the horrid 3D images from the 60's.All in all, a good story, decently told, despite the derivative plot and political underpinings. Butt at 3 hours, I am NOT likely to see this again.Wayno",7,0,1,24 January 2010
Inception," Loosely based on 'The Matrix'
","'Inception' SPOILERS AHEAD! Loosely based on the plot of 'The Matrix,' 'Inception' goes further down the 'rabbit hole' with a significantly better plot line, and much better acting, by Di Caprio. (Rest of cast, except for Michael Caine, Tom Berringer, and Lukas Haas were veritable unknowns.) If anyone has seen the re-make of 'The Day the Earth Stood Still,' then you know what I am talking about.The concept is simple. Plant an idea in someone's mind, without them knowing about it.While the story does NOT suspend your disbelief, it does have a few plot twists (predictable), that do keep you on the edge of your seat.The story line does get complicated at times. You don't exactly know which level of reality they are on. For thinkers like myself, that leaves you trying to figure out where they are, instead of just enjoying the movie for what it is: entertainment.The special effects aren't stellar. They are in-fact 'incredibly mediocre' by today's standards. The acting wasn't off the charts either. But Action/Adventure movies really don't have time to develop 'Depth of Character.' The ambiguous ending, does respect the audience in this case, and it finished well.Rated 4 stars out of 5 Wayno Tucson, Az",8,2,4,24 July 2010
Signs," We're in the money -- This movie's cruddy....
","We're in the money -- This movie's cruddy....That's just one way to describe this magnificent manure pile from M. Night Shyamalan.  Clearly, this guy should have NEVER quit his day job.The story develops (what little there is) exceedingly slow.  After 10 minutes I was shouting, come on get on with it, why are you dragging the inevitable out.  The slow thin plot development, would last another 30 minutes.The almost contact lens depth of character did NOT add to the overall effect of this film either.  'THIN' is the keyword to this movie.  Thin plot, thin shallow characters, thin dialogue...It all lead up to a very predictable movie experience.There were scenes in this movie that look like that might have been taken from the George Romero Classic, 'Night of the Living Dead!' -- Only 'Night of the Living Dead' -- did have a plot to it!  This thinly wired reconstruction, could only hope to aspire to such acclaim.The alien (note SINGULAR) in this movie looked like something out of 'Godzilla' or 'Creature from the Black Lagoon.'  In other words, 'a guy in a rubber suit!'I thought this movie trivial and banal at best.  Mel Gibson is a fantastic character actor, BUT NOT IN THIS MOVIE.  This movie basically would sux the chrome off a trailer hitch.  I was surprised Mel would agree to film such a bedraggled piece of crap.  It can only mean one thing:  They paid him well for his less the spectacular performance.  Every actor has his high's and low's, and this certainly was not his best performance.  Of course with 'contact lens' character development, you can't expect much.The 'ending' did NOT resolve the conflict of 'are the aliens going to invade, and are they friendly' question.  It ended quite abruptly, with no real ending at all.  Like I said the director, M. Night Shyamalan should NOT have quit is day job.Don't waste your money on this, its a piece of work from the get go.
Rated 1 reel out of 5.Wayno",1,1,2,14 August 2002
Rock Star," Thankfully -- NO SPANDEX !!
","The movie 'rock star' was much better then 'Almost Famous' (which 'almost' had an ending.) -- it is definitely a 'period' (a la 80's) piece.Plot was predictable, but not a nuisance.  if you can stand marky mark acting (mark wahlberg)  its not a bad piece.Its about a wanna-be rock star that makes it to the big time --and all the trappings that go along with making it.  In the end he finds himself -- but the journey is quite interesting.If you loved the music of the 80's == this will certainly bring back some memories - for me it brought back memories of all the Christian wanna be bands I dealt with in the late 80's and early 90's -- some of the memories were down right funny, others painful and insightful.the acting is not stellar, I've seen thicker plots in soup, but the movie had a certain naive' feeling to it, that Wahlberg portrayed well.and it was p.c. too - it DID have a g@y rocker in it. (hehe)This was not a spandex movie, but it had its share of make-up and long hair...thankfully it was more def leppardish in its musical style, rather then poison...overall -- rated 3 reels out of 5 (was a good way to kill an evening with nothing on tv to watch, iow)Wayno",6,0,1,21 March 2002
High Fidelity," I didn't get it --
","Like 'Clerks' - this movie made NO sense at all.  I guess because I am a boomer, not a 'gen x er'I couldn't relate to any of the situations in this, at all.I did make it till the end, but I feel like I just blew 2 hours.Definitely one of the suxiest movies I have seen since 'Being John Malkovitch'Infact the two movies had this in common:No Plot -- dialogue the is liberally sprinkled with four letter expletives, no acting.  The Music however was OKAY.I'd give it 1/4 reel out of five.(IOW 'Manos' was better!)This movie definitely made a definitive suxing sound....Wayno",1,1,6,19 December 2000
