Ali," Good but not Oscar worthy
","Going in to see ALI, I didn't know what to expect.  All i knew about Ali the man, was that he was the greatest boxer that ever lived.  Knowing this I wanted to see and learn who Ali was and what he was all about and what his life was about.  I got all of this out of the movie including some good history about that time but nothing that i saw was incredible or is/was deservable of an Oscar.Michael Mann is a great director i give him that and a lot of the shots that he chose were simply gorgeous and brought tears.  However I don't think he captured the entire essence of Ali himself.  It was just tidbit after tidbit of information.  There was not enough emotion in it for me.  Like Harry Potter where they sqeezed everything in but didn't take enough time for the audience to capture the characters.Will Smith did a great job portraying Ali and i was happily surprised however, yet again, not oscar worthy.  True Will Smith is cocky in life and loud, and none of this was shown in the movie, however Ali is cocky and shoots his mouth of in the movie like Wil Smith can sometimes do.  Will Smith was one note the entire movie.  And even if that was Ali or how Ali acted, it is not deserving of an oscar",Null,0,0,26 December 2001
