Casablanca," Am I missing something?
","So I finally got around to watching Casablanca, one of the greatest movies ever made, or so I've always heard. Does it live up to its hype? In a word, no. It was maudlin and melodramatic; Ingrid Bergman was homely, no matter how many softening effects were used in the close-ups of her face (did a rodent gnaw off the sides of her nose? To say nothing of that masculine jawbone and those underdeveloped lips...); Humphrey Bogart was about as slick and charismatic as the Hunchback of Notre-Dame; and the story was undisguised war propaganda. One would have to have the mental age of 5 to think this movie was in any way great. Watchable, yes, but not great, and certainly not deserving of being on the IMDb top 250.The movie was fast-paced, which was both good and bad: good because it would've been unbearable to watch otherwise, and bad because it didn't give the viewer time to get attached to any of the characters (which is just as well, since as I've said, it was war propaganda and so the less effective, the better).Apart from a few good one-liners and patches of clever dialog, the only other positive thing I can say about it is that it was technically well made, in particular the lighting and the dynamic camera work (though I'm not personally a fan of this style of camera work, as I find it detracts from story and atmosphere). It was, however, irritating how the lighting would change whenever there was a close-up on somebody's face. What was the purpose of this? To try to mesmerize the viewer? Talk about corny.If you've never seen Casablanca before, don't feel you have to, because you ain't missing much, 'kid.' It's about as overrated as it gets.1 out of 10 stars, to offset the deranged 'I'm giving it 10 stars but I wish I could give it more' reviews this cinematic mediocrity has been getting.",1,56,154,6 February 2010
Once Upon a Time in America," Should be buried next to Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate in the cemetery of failed epics
","I didn't like this movie.I found it corny and self-indulgent. The characters were uninteresting and one-dimensional. The story didn't grab me -- and did they really need nearly 4 hours to tell it? It was gratuitously sleazy, like a Tinto Brass film. The music was cheesy and unmemorable -- and yet others say that it's one of Morricone's best scores?! Not to mention that the music was mismatched to some scenes.I'll concede that the cinematography did rise to above average from time to time and that the last 10-15 minutes of the movie (starting from the scene with the garbage truck) were outstanding -- atmospheric, surreal, disturbing, bizarre, and beautiful. Too bad the other 3 1/2 hours weren't as good.1 out of 10 stars.",1,23,50,6 June 2010
Evil Dead II," More a remake than a sequel; disappointing
","Rather than picking up where the last one ended, Evil Dead 2 takes elements from the first movie and creates a new story that doesn't quite jibe with the old one. So it's more of a remake of the first than a sequel. But at the same time, it doesn't really stand up on its own and I can't help but think that someone who watched it without having seen the first would be lost; a lot of the references and inside jokes would go over his head.I found this movie pointless and don't understand why they bothered making it (other than the obvious financial motive, and to lay a foundation for the third movie of the series). As a remake, it didn't better or even equal the first or add anything original. It seemed like more of an excuse to mess around with special effects than anything, as there wasn't much in the way of story or character development. You could say it was ahead of its time, since like most current horror movies, it comes off like a long MTV video, with lots of gore and special effects, fast (too fast, IMO), jump cut editing, with the story taking a back seat.Bruce Campbell didn't bother me in the first one, but in this he was awful. His acting was self-conscious and he was trying too hard. I felt like I was watching a performance by a clown who thinks he's being funny but isn't.The comedic elements were less subtle than in the first. While I laughed at a couple of scenes (like the one with the meat cleaver), ultimately I was neither frightened by this movie nor amused by its attempts at slapstick. Bruce Campbell is no Buster Keaton or Jim Carrey, and Evil Dead 2 fails both as a comedy and a horror flick.The last 30 minutes were an improvement over the first hour, but only because by then it had turned into a prelude for the action-adventure-oriented third movie, with Campbell being a bit more credible as an action hero. (On a side note: Who came up with the rule that time travel always has to be depicted in movies as a tunnel or vortex?) The puzzling thing is that if they had chopped off the first 7 minutes of this movie, it easily could've been made into a real sequel rather than a remake and it would've been much better.Die-hard fans of the other Evil Deads or of Bruce Campbell might like this but I can't recommend it to anyone else. I sat drumming my fingers through most of it, wondering why they were wasting my time rehashing this material. This was one of those rare movies where I was tempted to fast-forward through parts. AFAIC, it wouldn't have made any difference if the producers had gone from the first Evil Dead straight to Army of Darkness and skipped this one.",3,0,4,17 September 2009
