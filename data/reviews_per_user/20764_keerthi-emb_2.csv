It," not so great movie which is given much hype
","1. It's not scary.
2. When kids don't act like kids, it's stupid.
3. doesn't even have a proper story-line -- loosely bound with a lot of no common sense stuff.Except for looking good with graphics, all the time we keep praying that there would be some thread that would tie all this nonsense together to make us feel better in the end -- but it's flat nonsense.
I'd personally prefer Jeepers Creepers over this, even the no graphic Conjuring 1 and 2 fare very well before this one. This over-hyped movie is a sheer disappointment.
It hurts even more to know that this is just 'Chapter 1' of the nonsense. If there are anymore sequels past this, it would most definitely be a cumulative garbage of sorts since the main story holds no foundation of any sorts.",3,5,8,1 August 2018
Alien: Covenant," A new low in the Alien Franchise
","If you are a fan of Alien and other its series, this is a sick movie of a Robot losing to insanity. I have never seen a crap movie like this and have took the pain trying to save fan souls trying to watch this movie for the sheer disappointment at 2am in the morning. I'm not sure if the Director intends to rip the reputation of Alien back from the history and put it to shame. I wish the movie should have never been even made. I thought Prometheus was a good start for a follow up and this one completely pulled it into the depths of no recovery. The story as it stands now has put to rest any hopes of a proper follow-up movie and it has to go through some episodes of redemption to get the fame back considering what the Director has done with the story. This one puts all the movie series to shame and established a new low for the Alien franchise. I'm positive that the Director might be feeling that 'the movie shouldn't have been made' kind of regret. If anyone can hear this transmission -- Please do not watch this movie ever. -- From an Alien franchise fan.",2,1,3,27 August 2017
