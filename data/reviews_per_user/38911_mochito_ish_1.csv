Requiem for a Dream," The Oscars are a sham!
","I just want to start by saying the Academy Awards have officially become a popularity contest. How else can you explain Julia Roberts as Best Actress? Ellen Burstyn's performance in this film was real, intense, gut-wrenching, heart-breaking, but most of all, passionately human. She exemplifies 'acting' as opposed to 'performing,' which is exactly what Julia Roberts did in 'Erin Brockovich.' Ms. Burstyn, if you're reading this, just know that everyone who has seen your work in this film knows you are the better actress. And, guaranteed, Julia Roberts knows it too.",10,0,0,1 July 2001
