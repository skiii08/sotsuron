The Ring," First scary horror film in ages
","I have to say, I was quite impressed with The Ring. Over the last few years I've started to become a fan of the horror genre. The trouble is, the more horror films I see, the less they manage to actually frighten me. And, to me, that's rather the whole point.Resident Evil got my vote not because the zombies were scary, but because it had some good shocks and nice action. The Ring is a very different type of movie, closer to horror than action.From the very first scene of the movie the eerie atmosphere is set very well. If you're actually watching the movie, it's near impossible not to get into the creepy mood. Even if you're just waiting for 'it' to happen, whatever it may be. The movie makes it quite clear, it will happen, and you do not know what it is. It's a really refreshing take from recent films where the villian is obvious.I've heard numerous reports of people losing sleep over this movie and having trouble leaving it at the theater. I can't say I found it frightening to that level, but it still managed to send a good chill down my spine throughout the film and startle me a number of times. I was shaking a bit coming out of the theater, I'm hoping it's because it was rather cold. ^_^;The horror is broken up from time to time with interesting and entertaining exploration and story development. However, just when you think the movie is switching from a horror flick to an interesting mystery flick, the horror elements return, in force.Although parts of the movie are somewhat corny, and many reports of the movie are of course over hyped, you will indeed at least be creeped out and entertained throughout. It's certainly worth seeing, and I'd recommend seeing it with a friend. You'll have a hard time not giving away the details if you don't.And if you like to bring a gullible, easily scared girl to the movies with you, don't be surprised if you end up jumping a few times yourself. ^_^ Don't worry, your friends who have seen it as well won't laugh at you... too much.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,10 February 2003
Minority Report," Could have been better
","Minority Report fails on many levels, but succeeds enough to be worth watching. Having seen it twice now, once in the theater and once on DVD, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss any of the story along the way. Even so, there's so much unexplained happenings it's absurd. I'm not the type who has to have a explanation for everything, but there's so many wild leaps and bounds in this movie it's simply outrageous at times. I'm all for sci-fi universes having their own set of rules, but Minority Report just leaves me scratching my head.The whole powerball wannabe crime detection system makes so little sense it's scary. In the age of incredible technology, wooden balls are used? What? And why does everyone throw out their TV sets, and project faded blurry images against walls? Why would newspapers and cereal boxes have moving up to date data? There's no way this could be practical cost wise. Why on Earth would cops use 'stick sticks' that makes the perpetrator throw up?! Why do the police run around like keystone cops trying to take the perps down using only said sick sticks and various other close combat techniques? Does the future have no sniper weapons? And why does Anderton Jr. run like he's one neuron short of a synapse? Okay, I'm just being mean now... but it's still true.I'm just getting started... why on Earth do I want to see a closeup of fake mucus oozing from someone's nose for absolutely no reason at all. The ending, which I won't spoil, is completely unsatisfying and actually ends up just leaving me wondering if they couldn't come up with anything better. It's like they just gave up on the story and defaulted to the simplest answer they could find. So many scenes make absolutely no sense and was put in for reasons I can't understand. An old woman smoking a pipe laughing... for no reason what so ever, having nothing at all to do with the story. A kid, alone and bored, going around on a merry-go-round. Why? It's like some kinda surreal experiment gone very wrong. And these clear computers... give me a break. There's no way they could be useful to the users, and would never survive.All that being said though, despite some big time flaws it's still a decent movie and it's worth watching at least once. The ending's a let down, half the story is unnecessary, and there's even two or three complete gross out scenes for no reason at all. Still, it manages to have it's moments, and the effects are pretty good. Worth renting, if you've nothing else to do.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,1,10 February 2003
12 Monkeys," Over rated, and far too hyper.
","Twelve Monkeys tries to be an interesting movie, and it does have a few sound concepts, but overall this movie is just plain annoying. Every last part of this screams low budget, poor acting, and cheap plot. Vastly over rated by it's fans, it explains it's plot in such detail nearly anyone can understand it and feel good.The first half of this movie is an absolute mess. Willis spends much of the first half drooling on himself, while Pitt rambles for hours on end with horrible acting. Throw in some random screaming insanity every few seconds, and you have the first hour of this movie. The worst part is the movie tries to capture a sense of desperateness, which amounts to nothing but people screaming at the top of their lungs at each other for long stretches of time. This movie is annoying, noisy, shallow, and way too hyper.The second half of the movie does actually manage to work out a few interesting concepts, but it's far too little and far too late to save it. Note that I don't say the second half of the movie is good, because it isn't. Tacky wardrobe, cheap locations, bad camera angles and dramatic fuzzy scenes only make the movie that much worse.This one isn't even worth watching on cable, save your time and spare yourself the hassle of listening to Pitt ramble and Willis try to be dramatic. If your idea of the future is plastic wrap jumpsuits, lame camera angles, and stock footage of animals in places and climates they'd never survive however, then go for it.",4,7,24,30 June 2004
Finding Nemo," Simply ok
","From the previews alone I could tell Finding Nemo would be below par. After watching the movie, I'm sure of it. This movie is long, dull, and overly sentimental. The voices are horribly annoying, mainly Ellen DeGeneres. She's just plain horrible as an actress and a voice actress. Albert Brooks is okay, not great but not bad. I'd say the only really good voices in the movie are Crush played by Andrew Stanton, and Bruce played by Barry Humphries. And they're just extras with only a handful of lines.The story will bore you to death and you'll feel like Nemo trying to just get away from it to have some fun with the movie. Folks marvel at the graphics, but come on... you really think this is impressive? It's nothing compared to Pixar's past. Let's see... the incredible detail of Monsters Inc, or the ocean where you're lucky to see 20 feet in front of you and a few small fish.All in all, I say skip this movie. It's much like watching an aquarium on a slow day; If you've got nothing else to do, it can be entertaining to gawk at the fish.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Final Destination 2," Solid fun.
","Despite all the bad reviews, I highly enjoyed this flick. If you're willing to just kick back and have a good time, this is one enjoyable movie. The acting is good, the special effects are incredible, and the plot is actually above average.Like Final Destination before it, this is a more creative horror film. It's not a hack and slash, but more a dark comedy of sorts. The fun of this film comes not from the events leading to death, but death itself. Luckily there's a large cast and the inbetween time is quite enjoyable.The scene that puts this movie over the top however, comes right at the start. Just like FD's plane explosion, it sets the pace for the entire movie. FD2's highway scene is simply an amazing event. It's jaw dropping, it's gruesome, and it's fun.They thankfully went for a strong R rating, and didn't shy away from getting really gruesome. They also threw in biker babe who briefly flashes early in the film, which probably should have been left out. Otherwise though, the suspense to gore ratio is just about right.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Resident Evil," Scary and Fun
","I was a bit worried this movie would be nothing but another bland horror attempt, but thankfully Resident Evil is far more. It has the visual effects, the soundtrack, and the acting to really shine. The story is complex enough to keep you guessing, but simple enough to let the action flow. Resident Evil is the truly first good horror movie in quite some time.The visual effects of RE are quite unique. A beautiful mix of all CG scenes with live action really puts that video game fill into it. The often overlooked fact is that as a RE gamer, you usually have at least in part a lot of info on the world around you. You know things you couldn't otherwise know. For example, how things work, maps, where things are, etc. This movie does a great job of keeping the viewer informed in this manner, without going so far as to ruin the surprises. As for the undead, this movie is unmatched. The way they move, moan, and even die is exactly what any RE fan will expect. It's really good to see the attention to detail.The soundtrack is every bit as cool. In the theater it sounded incredible, and it certainly doesn't disappoint at home. For all of those out there watching on some crud two speakers system. you'll miss out. The movie just doesn't have the same punch without the deep bass and creepy ambient surround sounds around you. For all of those with the system to handle it, you'll have a new showcase title for your DVD collection.As for the acting, the downfall of so many movies, it's simply outstanding. You really do feel as if you're watching an elite squad of jaded specialists. It's somewhat like Starship Troopers, in a different setting. I really felt convinced of the performances. When they're hurt, they act hurt. When they're scared, they're scared. There's very little room for uncertainty here. If they actors aren't upset about being injured, or scared of the death that surrounds them, then it's quite hard for the audience to be concerned either.Resident Evil manages to not only get the job done, but to excel. It should pass all expectations you may have for it, and surprise you a few times as well. It certainly ranks among my favorites as an action / horror flick. I honestly believe it would even if it didn't have the game series behind it.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,10 February 2003
Grave of the Fireflies," A well told story
","Grave of the Fireflies is a great movie about a boy and his young sister during WW2. It's a rather emotional movie, and it's often called one of the best anti-war movies ever. I don't buy that this movie is at all anti-war. It's much more of a personal experience than anything. This is a story about the human spirit. The film never seems to point fingers or lay blame.First off, this is indeed an extremely good movie. The story is great and the characters are very likable. The Japanese voices are spot on, even the girl. All the parts are well written, and very believable. Nothing seems stretched to the absurd.The art is simply beautiful. Fans of movies such as Kiki's Delivery Service or Mononoke will notice things feel very familiar, due to being these all being from the same studio. The colors range from dark and sad to bright and cheery, sometimes fitting with the mood and other times as a stark contrast to the reality around them.At any rate, it's a really good story and one that's hard to forget. It's well told, it's memorable, it's likable, and it's at times quite sad. If you're looking for something different and serious rather than the normally light-hearted crowd of anime, give this a shot. You won't be disappointed.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,1,2,22 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Awful
","Rating this movie is simple, it's garbage. I can list reason after reason, and the Reloaded fans of the world aren't going to care less. Keanu could spend the 138 minutes reading the newspaper (He's kinda slow...) and these people would still rave about it.This movie should have tanked big time, but sadly the fans don't care about quality. The acting is horrible, the CG is embarrassingly bad, and the story is mindless psychobabble. Folks, this is NOT deep thought. This is meaningless babble designed to make the easily impressed think they said something smart. If you haven't figured it out yet folks, they're pulling the story out of their hat as they go along. (Hat in the G rated version...)The movie does manage to have one or two amusing scenes, but they are far, far overshadowed by the horrible ones. There's a incredibly long rave scene that is just beyond lame. The whole Zion scene, which is the first half of the movie, is just pathetic. Sadly, even the scenes that are amusing go on to the point where they become a bore. If you're an intelligent fan of the Matrix, skip this movie at all costs.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Sub Par
","This one was pretty much a flop for me. While it wasn't all bad, and I've certainly seen worse movies... it just didn't hold the same appeal as Sorcerer's Stone. The magic was gone and in it's place just a few whiny sidekick kids and Harry. And, slight spoiler... the 'Chamber of Secrets' is very poorly named indeed.Many things disappoint me about this film. The first of which is the utter lack of magic in a school of magic. Flying cars, check. Ghosts, check. Bunch of other ridiculous things having nearly nothing to do with magic, check. But actual spells and wizardry? Very little. The only one of this whole gang of wizards that seems to be able to cast a spell is Hermione, and she sits a lot of this movie out. Apparently Harry and Ron should both be held back a few grades.Another HUGE disappointment for me, and it nearly ruins the movie, is the constant overuse of the school system. Oh, gee... our three heros are in trouble again because they happen to be in the wrong place. Oh no, better not tell them what's really going on... better break another few dozen rules instead. What's that? You think we did it? Oh no... we might be, gulp, expelled for the 25th time. Give me a break. It's used and reused and used yet again to the point of utter insanity.The acting is good, nothing mind blowing but good. Harry stands well in most scenes, but Ron is often overacted. Though, from the looks of things, I'm willing to bet he was told to overact. 'Harry, you look brave. Ron, you look cowardly and whiny. - Action!' Worse is the character Dobby, who I couldn't hate any more than I already do. The best new character is probably the girl ghost Moaning Myrtle. Both her CGI effects and acting were really good, sadly they look like they got stuck in the wrong movie and belonged in something much better.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Army of Darkness," Solid horror / comedy.
","Lately I've been craving to find a truly good horror film, and with Evil Dead II, I've finally found it. If you're a comedy fan and even a casual fan of horror, you simply need to watch Evil Dead II. It's such a perfect mix of comedy and horror that you just can't go wrong. I haven't jumped so many times at a horror film in ages, and I've never laughed so hard at the same movie.On the horror side of things, this movie is truly a horror film. I jumped and squirmed so many times I lost count. From start to finish it's filled with gore and disturbing creatures of all sorts. The effects may be cheesy by now, but it really doesn't matter. You'll take a sick pleasure in watching poor Ash scream in borderline insanity. Yet, it thankfully never crosses the line from dark fun all out sick. It's gruesome gore filled fun, but it stays on the right side of the fine line between fun and sick.On the comedy side of things, Bruce Campbell has become a cult action comedy hero from this movie. You'll laugh so hard at his utter breakdowns of emotion you'll wonder what side your rooting as good and bad blur into smear of insanity. The laughing room scene cracked me up and freaked me out all at the same time, and Bruce never misses a beat of the hair trigger fun.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,1,1,22 June 2003
Bruce Almighty," Falls short
","I didn't expect much from this film, and sadly that's exactly what I got. The entire movie borders on boredom, saved only by Carrey, Freeman, and Carell. Without these three, this movie would be a total and utter bomb. Aniston, popular for no good reason, is as poor as ever.It's not a total waste though. There's some good jokes along the way that'll at least give you a chuckle. The love story is as horribly bland as Episode 2, but it's not so bad you can't get through it. As for the special effects... I haven't seen stop motion so obvious since the early 80's of film. It's just pathetic how obvious it is, though in a scene or two Carrey manages to make it funny. All in all, wait for the DVD and rent it for the 3 big names.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,0,0,22 June 2003
Signs," Dreadful
","I've seen some lame movies, but this is one of the worst I've ever seen. This movie is just plain painful to watch start to finish. It's not even the type you can enjoy mocking, it's just plain stupid. I can not believe the rave reviews this movie has got. And to everyone who says 'You just don't get the message!'... believe me, I got it. Everyone who has been forced to watch this movie got it. I'm not ignorant, I just don't care. The message is every bit as sickeningly dull as the movie itself.Every time the story even starts to get going, something so freaking stupid it makes my very brain ache happens. Have a touching moment about God vs Random... follow it up with a story about a girl puking on herself. Yep, that's good cinema.We have a family who are so dumb it's sad. No TV, it's evil. Don't ever talk to the girl who swears again, she's evil. Don't ever talk to any people from out of town, they're evil. Don't ever call anyone by anything but their full name, it's evil. Don't prey, it's evil... or something, he doesn't know. Got it? No? Cry about it now, because every 35 minutes there's gotta be a crying scene.Now we get to the aliens. Not only are they absolutely the worst aliens I've seen in ages, they're the stupidest as well. They can't break down a freaking wooden door or boards. Give me a break... these absolute cosmic rejects would be destroyed in mere minutes. The most retarded aliens to ever cross space.This movie is so very flawed it's hard to find the right words to describe it. All I can say is if you see some kind of deep message that you find awe inspiring then you're grasping at straws. Stop praising this worthless lump of a movie and go join a local church group. As Mel pathetically says in a very weak voice: 'I'm insane with anger.. arrgh.'<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,1,1,10 February 2003
Gangs of New York," Awful
","I had hoped to enjoy this film, and for awhile I did. As time went on through the film got worse, and worse, and worse. By the time the movie finally ended, I pretty much hated the movie. The film does have some strong points, but what we're left with is almost insulting. The good parts of the film are hopelessly outshined by the horrible.The overall story that develops is dull as can be. Everyone in the film is corrupt. There's simply no one to root for in this film except maybe the army who are almost shown as the bad guys. Nearly everyone in the movie is a murderer, a racist, or both. It's that bad, and I'm speaking quite literally.The gore goes from entertaining in the start to offensively disgusting in the end. There's also some pointless nudity, but we're not talking Cameron Diaz here. It's just extra girls laying around topless for no real reason. Extremely pointless and not in the least attractive. Overall I strongly recommend avoiding this film. It's incredibly long, dull, and you'll feel like you need a long shower after watching it.<ul><li>Rirath_com</li></ul>",Null,1,2,22 June 2003
