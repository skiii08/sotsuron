The Equalizer," Needs more equalizing
",Denzel carries this movie on his shoulders. Nothing else was good except when he uses his watch and does his thing. Needed more of it and never got satisfaction.,6,0,1,27 March 2019
Fight Club," #1 Rule!
",Just one of many movies you can watch over and over and never get bored or tired of it.I would talk about Fight Club more but I can't break the #1 rule in Fight Club!,10,0,1,10 March 2019
Captain Marvel," Not very marvelous
",The best parts in the movie where the ones that flashed by. The character development needed more time to development and gave it no chance to breathe. When it was trying to connect the dots from other movies it failed to connect dots in its own. Should have been released in phase one when new characters were being introduced. Too close to Endgame to squeeze all what was needed to make this character likeable. Making a character who has little to no weaknesses is not fun to watch when there is no stake to what they do.,6,4,10,9 March 2019
Us," Plot armour is best armour
",Everyone dies easy but no the main cast cannot. Even with the dad limping the entire movie he is still terminator. Come on now. At the end the mom is doing matrix moves but dies to the fire poker...The first half was good up into the point when they watch the news. Then it's all downhill from that point on.,3,3,4,23 May 2019
Aquaman," Ok ok
",Stories a wee bit funny eh. Aquaman in desert...Really? Underwater bubble speech? Can't understand guys. Beautiful SFX..so. Stop pouring money in the way it looks and shove it in the story. Outie,6,1,1,6 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor watcha doin?
",Funny honey too many funny? I like a good laugh but every 5 secs? Cheesy fries. Back to God of Thunder. Whoppa day booty not laffy taffie.,5,1,6,6 March 2019
Suicide Squad," Could have been far better
","This is the result of not having enough time to fully give these characters time to breathe and some much needed backstory so I care for them. Instead of trying to compete with Marvel and rush things, take some time and develop each character before throwing darts against a wall and see what hits.Margo Robbie shines as well as Will Smith. Villain was not used well and very mediocre as usual.",6,0,0,15 March 2019
Interstellar," Stellar movie
",The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.,7,2,2,8 March 2019
Bird Box," See this
",This was another fresh step in the right direction. Sandra B gives another great performance. Being able to not see what is coming is challenging and horrifying to say the least. Not knowing much was great for the suspense.Only downsides of the film was the lack of seeing the monster. Others have seen it but the audience was declined. Also don't spoil the movie by going into the future letting me know the condition of my main protagonist. Ruins the journey and suspense of will they live will they die.,6,0,1,8 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Yes He Can!
","Spiderman! Beautiful art jaw hitting ground, funny drink out nose LOL , action packed, music gonna make you pow pow! feels in the belly jelly, story arcs got it all in there. Swing on in you won't be sorry. Please sir Ginnie more.",10,2,4,6 March 2019
The Lego Movie," Awesome!
",This movie made me buy some Legos myself lol. Awesome story and action. They can make anything into anything which can keep this movie unpredictable whenever they wanted to. Villain was the best and overall was totally satisfied with the end. Pass the Popcorn!!!,9,0,1,12 March 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Pure Bliss
",Everything I have been waiting for for the past 10 years and then some! Everything paid off in the final act of the movie. The greatest hour in superhero movies that will probably never happen on the big screen ever!,10,3,7,30 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," 20+ actors Duh
",Everyone in here partying it up. No time for talkie talk. Action all over the place. Then pow pow guts you at the end. Blinders on if not a 10. Fun movie here it is. Watch,10,0,3,6 March 2019
Get Out," Get some popcorn
","The movie kept me interested throughout the whole movie. A slow burner for sure.How is this a horror movie???It's more of a mystery/thriller. Not at all 'scary' what so ever. The conclusion as satisfying as it it's but it need more of a closer as in a newspaper headline or news coverage to say family murder or something for a nice bowtie.Now what if he hears a spoon hit a tea cup in the next 70 years will he just be paralyzed for a while? He should have made her undo that part I suppose.
Not a Horror film at all.",5,1,4,21 March 2019
The Incredibles," Incredible
",A super hero family with all different powers! Sign me up. Funny action pack movie for all ages.,9,0,0,12 March 2019
A Quiet Place," Silent but deadly
",A thrilling new way for horror. Kept my interest throughout the movie. Can't wait to see more of the expanding universe. A lot of questions not answered for different sounds. Hopefully the next installment will dive deeper on this spots.,7,0,0,8 March 2019
Zombieland," Better zombie movie
",One of the better zombie movies out. A lot of new idea's on the zombie apocalypse and fresh. A fun ride and a few laughs.,7,0,1,13 February 2020
Inception," InceptionALY Great!
",Dreams within dreams within dreams that make you wonder. Where do I sign up? The movie make you want to see how they can pull off what they did and it didn't disappoint. The ending makes the audience decide which is always a nice conversation starter and makes for a good discussion afterward.,10,0,1,16 March 2019
Wonder Woman," Not so wonderful
",The only thing that was good was the scene from No Man's Land. This was WWs bad ass moment. More of her doing this without heavy cgi would have made me give this a 10 but it didn't. After that nothing.The same story and plot as many other hero's journey. Following around Steve throughout the whole movie was boring. Giving her a relationship as well. Hollywood can't avoid having people fall for each other at first sight can they?The third act... do I have to even say anything? Made no sense. Steve killing himself what? She's a God who can't die. Shouldn't she have had that moment of being the hero? He shouldn't have even brent there. He distracted her from her own movie! The CGi fest was also too much.,5,1,6,15 March 2019
Black Panther," Copy pasta
",This was a generic marvel movie. Terrible cgi. Characters could have been developed better. The plot and conclusion could be seen from the start. But overall a decent movie. Nothing to go crazy over. A fun time.,7,0,4,2 April 2019
Creed II," Obviously
",Too obvious. Not gonna loose 2x in a row. Reason no edge of seat nail bitter. AND no company gets Rocky Any Sponsors.... What! also repeat final boss. Throw darts at a board at least. Spaghetti,5,0,1,6 March 2019
The Greatest Showman," And I hate musicals
",Heck. Enjoyed it. Zack and Wolverine carry it. Songs sticks in your head for days afterward. Singing in shower for Pete sake!,8,1,2,6 March 2019
Annihilation," My brain hurts
",What did I watch may you ask? I don't know. I was lost throughout this movie. Didn't know what was going on and still don't.,3,0,2,20 March 2019
Incredibles 2," Still incredible
",Still a action packed all round fun for the family movie. The evil villain was still the same copy pasta but overall still incredible. Enjoyed the movie throughout,6,0,0,12 March 2019
