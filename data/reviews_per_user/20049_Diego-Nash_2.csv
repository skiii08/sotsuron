It," It, the success of marketing
","Let's face the truth, It's a good product beyond the limits imposed by Warner most likely looking for a product with a certain impact on the audience but let's go calmly. The Denry by Andres Muschietti, able to alternate very intimate moments with functional Jump Scare, was designed and resumed by highlighting the point of view of the kids who are protagonists of this distressing story. The mastery of faded and dreary atmospheres, coordinated by a clean and rigorous direction, has allowed a very unreal and sometimes alienating realization of the town whose inhabitants seem distant and disinterested in the problem that infects Denry, or IT. This characterization allows the actors, sumptuous in this film, to express themselves in the best rivalry even in the excellence of a Bill Skarsgard that attracts towards the attentions of the whole audience. The developed stories are powerful and profound, as if they were torn from the ingenious mind of Stephen King and created a growing empathy towards the group of Boys (the Loser) who are dragged or dragged into a macabre and often disturbing adventure. Compared to the TV series of the 1990s, IT is much more active and effective, and it is appreciated, in fact, as it has underlined its danger, in addition to its great dowry of metamorphosis (which in the 1990s with that budget was certainly difficult to realize). If some stories of this adventure are developed a lot, and very well, others are simply sketched and left aside, as if they had forgotten about them. This lack of 'courage' is also noticed in IT incursions and especially in the crudity of some of the factors closely related to the city and the racist story narrating in the book. This brings with it a slowing down of narrative time shortly after the first act that fortunately rises in the middle of the second to end in the third. I did not appreciate, however, the final part, where it seems that you wanted to put a 'Point' without dragging too much. Final Summary IT is a valuable piece of work that staged one of the most beloved Horror films of such genres, surely becoming the second best film taken from a book by Stephen King after Shining. The film, however, is in some respects a lack of 'editorial courage' that has not allowed the film to become an eternal masterpiece, waiting for the future to be trembling.",8,1,2,25 October 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," 80s? No thanks!
","Let's make it clear: It's one of the worst Marvel movies. Not that Thor's saga is famous for being directed in an unobtrusive way, but from Ragnarock's saga, I honestly expected something different. What is perceived by seeing this chapter in the Thor saga and the total annihilation of the epic and poetry of what is a particular Hero and very different from the others, bound in an indissoluble manner to a strong and epic mythology. Everything in this movie becomes glitterous and stupidly irritating, transforming the atmosphere into an Action movie where you need to make the spectator laugh with any kind of joke, taking away the little credibility left to the Thor package. Once my position was clarified on this point, I would like to say that the actors seemed compelling and the special effects perfect without any banging. The plot that has been developed has no big flaws even though it's too trivial, even for a Marvel movie. I only regret that I have not witnessed a convincing and epic Final Chapter, which left room for an annoying comic spot spotted with special effects and music stubbornly 80. # Stop'80",5,6,18,29 October 2017
