Skyfall," Finally, 007 is back..
","This is the Bond film we all know and love. Unlike the previous installment which suffered from a serious Bourne hangover, this film is more in the tradition of the great Bond films of yore. Although still not quite perfect, it is a step in the right direction and we can expect great things from the forthcoming films. The film is quite dark but Craig's performance is terrific. Dame Judi Dench is a great actress and here she gets a lot of screen time. The script is taut and the climax mind blowing. References to earlier Bond films and well delivered quips are welcome additions. All in all, go and watch it and it you wont regret it. As my title says, this time, 007 is truly back...",9,2,17,5 November 2012
