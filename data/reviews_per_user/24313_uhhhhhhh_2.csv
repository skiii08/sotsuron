The Blair Witch Project," UNSCARY AS HELL
",Rolling Stone said this movie was 'Scary as Hell' well I have to say this is the complete opposite 'UNSCARY AS HELL'. This movie had no scary parts at all. In fact most of the movie takes place in broad day light with the three student film makers walking around. The movie ii completely fake none of the movie really happened maybe the reason its doing so well at the box office is because of all the hype. I think that this is probably the worst movie of the year!!!,Null,0,1,18 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Good movie great ending but the ending needs some explanation!!!
",I think that this movie was really good even though nothing happened for the first hour!!! The ending needs some explanation it took me awhile to remeber something in the movie that made the ending not make sense! I'd say this is the best Bruce Willis movie I've seen!,Null,0,0,8 August 1999
