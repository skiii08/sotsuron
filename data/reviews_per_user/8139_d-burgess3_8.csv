Casablanca," casablanca
","This was a pretty okay romantic drama film that I would never watch again. However, I was not moved by this movie at all. I mean, it was long and boring not keeping my interest what so ever. I can say there were some parts that had me wondering but then it just fell apart in front of me as I watch. Most people say this movie is also a classic but because I'm not a fan of movies like these, I say different. I did understand from the ending, the man that let the lady go was torn between love and virtue. He only did what was right for her and didn't think of himself. The ending of this movie was really delightful. I like how at the end he and the man walk together into the fog. In all this movie was acceptable but I will never think to watch it again.",Null,1,4,27 April 2012
Citizen Kane," KAne
","I don't know what to really say about this movie, but I do know it was pretty bearable to watch. As a director, Orson wells is pretty good and is known for making good movies. He plays as Charles foster Kane, an enormously wealthy media proprietor who dies and then BANG! He becomes historic news around the world. I remember seeing a clip in class from citizen Kane when he's in the room and he tears everything down. I laugh about that part because what if they had to do a retake? Anyway, the news reporter was so fascinated in getting to understand Kane meaning of rosebud; his last words, which I just don't get at all. Throughout the movie the lighting was always on point to. This movie was pretty good and was considered one of wells best movies.",6,1,3,10 May 2012
The Exorcist," Great movie
","In my opinion this movie was one of the scariest movies in the 70's, if you compare and contrast all scary movies during that time you would agree. I say this because during the 70's there were your basic scary icons, Jason, Michael, and Freddy. This type of horror film captured reality like if this can happen in your own home. That moment when the girl walks down the steps backwards on all four, were the scariest part in the entire movie. It's not like that was edited and computerized like most horror films now, that was really done with great skill and talent. That's why I consider this movie to be the best Exorcist compared to the remakes.",8,1,2,26 April 2012
Annie Hall," Acceptable in my books
","Never really knew too much about woody Allen, not even a fan of him but this movie was basically about a part of his life where he adored this woman so much that he had to make a movie out of it. This movie captured his realism and comical ways. This movie was done with great creativity and breaking norms by him talking to the cameras. I founded it so fascinating in the beginning when he talks back to himself as a child in the classroom. Basically he went on a journey to try to figure out went wrong his relationship, and throughout the movie u can understand why it failed. But this movie was pretty clever and done well in my opinion.",6,0,0,26 April 2012
The Graduate," Great movie
","This was a prodigious movie which I essentially enjoyed, from the beginning when he was seduced to the very blank look on his face at the end. The movie conveyed a message about life and I felt it meant you only live once, so do what you have to do to get what u want; however the end of the movie is a bit pointless, on their behalf. He went all out for a girl he barely knew but loved so much. He basically stalks her around her school. On the other hand at the end, they both had a very confusing look as 'what do we do now?' I found that to be pretty fascinating because he went out his way to get her and she ran out on the middle of her wedding to be with him. There are so many interesting more parts I would like to say but then again I will be spoiling the whole movie. Mr. Hoffman played a great character in the graduate. In all this movie was once again another attention grabbing movie to watch.",8,3,4,19 April 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Nice
","Well I'm not a fan of musicals, because as the movie goes on it becomes boring and irritating. However, this movie was a bit different, I actually enjoyed it. This was an old time musical which I expected to be boring and never to end. This movie wasn't like that all, it was full of vibrant colors, great comedy, and bold characters; which whom had versatile acts. I enjoyed every bit of it from the beginning to the very end. Everything just fell in place; I wasn't confused or stuck on what was happening. Like most musicals I watch, I become confuse and lost into what I'm watching. Maybe because I become so overwhelmed with the singing, I forget what's going on in the movie, Lol. Although this movie was a musical, I actually enjoyed it and thought all the songs that were sung were pretty catchy.",8,0,1,2 April 2012
Psycho," Well Done
","Alfred hitchcock was always known for his great suspenseful movie, Psycho is one of the most popular suspenseful horror movie that hitchcock had made in my opinion because it shocked you without actually showing the penetration of the knife. To my discretion, movie like these made in the 60's never really caught my attention because I wasn't a big fan of them. I enjoy movies where there are two sides to a person because it confuses you and have you thinking its anther person. In all conclusions, when you think its two people it was only____, wouldn't you like to know? Nonetheless this movie was filled with great unexpected scenes and wonderful acting; I applaud the actors in this movie, well done.",8,0,0,2 April 2012
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," what great acting
","I choose this movie only because I know jack Nicolson sometimes have pretty boundless movies, my all favorite by him is The Shining. However I consider this movie to be on the same level at that movie because this had such great acting. I think his roles as the insane/disorderly one are entertaining to watch. After watching easy rider I was quite hesitant to even look at the other movies I was assigned, but I have to do them anyway. This movie really made me want to cry, I'm going to be quick and brief about this movie. It had great climax, lovely well rounded characters and a marvelous ending. I would watch this movie over and over and over again. I really enjoyed this movie and was very content into watching it. Also when I was watching the scene when the guy wanted his cigarettes back I became tense and emotional. That's when I knew this movie took a moral toll on me. Best intrigued movie ever.",9,1,2,25 April 2012
