The Blair Witch Project," A good idea, with some SERIOUS flaws.
","Heather Donahue Josh Leonard Mike WilliamsThe premise is that three filmmakers went into the woods to make a documentary and disappeared, only to have their equipment found a year later. The film is supposedly their own footage pieced together, a horrifying and true tale of supernatural evil.This is both the genius and the undoing of the film. The idea is excellent, but the entire experience hinges on the audience being convinced that what they are seeing is real. Unfortunately, the film does a poor job of convincing us. The low budget and inexperience of the filmmakers shows through time and time again.Often actors will forget or flub lines and have to repeat them (didn't they have a chance to edit this thing?) One particularly embarrassing instance happens during this exchange, about 3/4 of the way through the film:Heather: What do we do now? Mike: I think we should go into that horse. (pause) Heather: Don't you mean 'house,' Mike? (Mike looks into the camera doubtfully, turns back to Heather) Mike: Yes. House. Heather:(looking directly into the camera) Can we do that one again?Other flaws include the very unrealistic 'forest' (which was actually a huge sound studio in Los Angeles dressed to look like a real woods). At one point Josh leans against a 'tree' which is obviously made of styrofoam. The tree easily topples over, and all three cast members begin giggling uncontrollably.Not only did this ruin the tension in the scene, but it contains a plot hole as well: the character of Josh was supposed to be dead by that point in the film.It's probably worth a rental, but not much more. Look for cameos by Elizabeth Montgomery as the witch, and Bill Paxton as a small pile of rocks. I give it one star.",Null,1,2,26 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Slightly disturbing
","Mark Hammil Harrison Ford Steve BuscemiStar Wars is a sci-fi adventure set in a distant galaxy in the year 1975. It is the story of Luke (Hammil) and his Danish friend, Han (Ford).Luke and Han, together with Han's pet, Chewie (named because of his chronic habit of biting off the limbs of any human he comes near) travel the galaxy looking for the Dilithium crystals used to power their spaceship. Along the way, they meet a professional wrestler who calls himself simply 'The Force' who helps Luke and Han strong-arm their victims into giving up their crystals.'Star Wars,' a sequel to the 1986 sci-fi thriller 'The Ice Pirates' is an enjoyable film, but it may be too harsh for some younger viewers. At one point Han and Luke meet up with young Anakin Skywalker, a slave who lives on the desert planet of Nevada. Luke convinces Anakin that he is his father, then inexplicably cuts off Anakin's hand at the wrist using his 'Electronoprojection Energy Sword of Death' (that's what they call it). Anakin screams in pain as blood sprays like a fire hose - but Han and Luke only stand by and laugh like hyenas.This makes it difficult to sympathize with the main characters, and also makes it hard to understand why the filmmakers have been attempting to market this film to children.But in the end, Star Wars gives the viewer everything he would expect from a Hollywood space opera, and more. I give the film two stars.",Null,1,2,26 November 2006
X-Men," Waste of Time
","Once upon a time, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) pitched a very ambitious X-Men to the studio, a $175 million extravaganza including all of the characters from the comic book (some to be entirely computer-generated). But the studio quickly clipped Singer's wings, demanding he keep production costs down. I suppose you get what you pay for.For instance, the filmmakers wanted the plot to revolve around Wolverine - a muscle-bound mutant with razor-sharp metal claws. Instead the studio gave them an actual wolverine, a small but ferocious woodchuck-type creature. To make it worse, they weren't able to pay for a professional wolverine handler, so throughout the film you see one of the other X-Men carrying Wolverine around in a small cage. During the few scenes when Wolverine actually gets into the action, they just use a stuffed wolverine and clever editing. And don't jump on me for nitpicking - it's pretty noticeable. The animal in the cage is brown, with dark eyes. When it's out, all the sudden it's bright red and makes a giggling sound when somebody touches it. There are rumors they used a Tickle Me Elmo doll for the part.Singer also wanted the popular character Cyclops (who in the comic has a visor that unleashes a devastating beam) to play a major role in the film. The studio replaced that character with StareMaster, a featureless man with the superhuman ability to stare motionlessly at an object for days at a time. StareMaster is played by a department store mannequin.There are other complaints, more than I can get into here. The character of Storm (Halle Berry) no longer has the ability to control the weather (as she does in the comic) but can now only observe the weather. There's one scene at the beginning where she displays her 'power,' and it goes something like this:Rain slowly begins to fall on the group of X-Men. STORM steps away from the group, and gazes into the sky, a look of intense concentration washes over her face.STORM Wait! I think..... it's raining!DR. X She's right! I hope this doesn't interfere with StareMaster's staring powers!STAREMASTER .........WOLVERINE That tickles! Ha ha ha ha ha!!!Get the picture? The in-X-plicable budget limits the studio set on the X-Men are also the reason why the film has a grade C cast; for the part of Dr. X, the filmmakers wanted Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) but instead got Patrick Swayze (Road House). For super bad-guy Magneto they wanted classical actor Ian McKellan (Apt Pupil), but got Dom Deluise (Cannon Ball Run 2).Well, I say from now on if you're gonna do a big-time comic book movie, do it right. Hopefully the upcoming Fantastic Four film (starring John Ritter, Mickey Rourke, Jim J. Bullock and Dennis Rodman) will have more to offer than this worthless piece of X-crement.I give X-Men one star.*",Null,0,1,19 December 2006
Sleepy Hollow," A great movie about a terrible disease
","Johnnie Depp Christina Ricci Sleepy Hollow is the stylish, nightmarish tale of one man's descent into the world of narcolepsy.Johnny Depp plays the title character, a New York detective who's life is turned upside down when he is stricken with the rare sleeping disorder. For those of you who don't know, narcolepsy causes the victim to suddenly fall asleep at random times, often when faced with sudden stress or excitement. It can happen anywhere: at the grocery store, while waiting in line at the bank, or during a top secret mission to assassinate a central American dictator.Depp's brilliant performance takes us deep into the realm of narcolepsy. Some will criticize the role, pointing out that Depp spends most of Sleepy Hollow's 3-hour running time snoozing. But even when sleeping, the actor is somehow able to spill forth the emotion that locks us into this story. It's not an actor up there, pretending to be sleeping. This man is really sleeping; you can feel it.The man's tale becomes more and more horrifying with time. The disorder disrupts every aspect of his life, including one sadly humiliating scene where he and his girl go bowling, and he falls asleep just as he's about to roll the ball, and goes flying. He eventually loses his driver's license, due to his disorder. From that point on, he is forced to ride horseback, bringing ridicule from those around him.Finally, near the end of the film, Depp suffers the most devastating symptom of narcolepsy. During the advanced stages of the disease, the vertebrae in the neck become so over-stressed that eventually the entire cranium dislodges and falls off the body. However, the heartless townspeople show no pity, instead mocking him by referring to him as 'The Headless Horseman.' I can only hope that this film brings some understanding and insight to this terrible disease, so that maybe the public will show more tolerance than the people in Sleepy Hollow did. I also think Oscar nominations should go to Depp, as well Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's granddaughter in the film.I give Sleepy Hollow two stars.**",Null,0,0,26 November 2006
American Beauty," Pretty Good
","Kevin Spacey Every once in a while a film comes along that is so wretched, so spine-crushingly terrible that it makes us question our will to live, and indeed our will to let anyone else live.I'm talking about a work of the dark arts, an atrocity to be counted among the most horrific ever brought forth from the rotting lower crust of the human race. A holocaust; a black plague. An experience that chews at the thin fabric of sanity like a sanity-eating rat until we're left wrapped into a fetal position on the theater floor, hugging the cool concrete for comfort in a pool of our blood and vomit, our skin bathed in cold sweat; our muscles twitching. We clamp our hands over our ears as we try to block it out; to not believe it's real, our grease-stained popcorn bags jammed over our heads like a radiation hood.But still the evil pours forth from that silver screen, radiating it's hellish energy over all in its path. Each frame scars, each scene scratches life from your soul like an IRS wage deduction. Every line of dialogue devours the will to live, like a swarm of locusts feasting on a helpless goat, running through the burning sands of Iraq's Goat Valley. The two hours stretch into an eternity of suffering, a neverending torture not contemplated in the deepest, darkest corners of Dante's imagination.And then you have 'American Beauty,' which is pretty good. I give it two stars.**",Null,2,4,26 November 2006
Men in Black II," Slightly disturbing, but still thoroughly enjoyable
","Darren 'The Human Beat Box' Robinson Mark 'Prince Markie Dee' Morales Damon 'Kool Rock-ski' Wimbley Peter North This is one of those new convenient direct-to-video sequels that I've discovered in the days since I stopped going to the theater. I always feel guilty going these days because the rude theater owners keep the film running even when the other patrons are getting important cell phone calls. It could be an emergency! I spotted this one during a trip to the 'Adult' video section, which I can only assume is reserved for films with complex themes only adults would understand (and even then only with hours of silent contemplation). I had high hopes. I had seen the first Men in Black, and I was impressed with the Fresh Prince's ability to act and maintain a wholesome, family-oriented comedic styling. But with his absence in the sequel, Men in Black II: Black in Men, one can really tell that the film suffered.First of all, there are way too many sex scenes. After six or seven of them, the movie just gets redundant, and when I take the time out of my busy schedule to see a movie, I don't want to get bored in the first half hour. Now, don't get me wrong. I don't mind a sex scene being in a movie, as long as it progresses the plot and it is important to convey the true story or message of the movie. However, MIB just doesn't seem to follow those traditional rules. In the first ten minutes alone, there were 2 sex scenes and one strip-tease that had nothing to do with character development at all: Delivery Man: I have a package to deliver.Agent K: Yeah, I bet you do. You can put it in the rear with the rest.Delivery Man: Well, it's kind of big, so you'll have to sign for it.Agent K: And where should I sign? Delivery Man: You can sign right here. . . *zzziiippp!* The total lack of female roles in the movie was also a bit disturbing. Though when you think about it, the movie is called Men in Black, I just feel that some of the roles, such as the French Maid, the Mother-In-Law, and the Dancing Queen could have been played by professional actresses rather than men dressed as women. But if it worked for Shakespeare, I guess it can work for director MIB 2 Marvin Lebinski (Kickboxing Cyborg 6, Schindler's List 3: Rise of the Vampires).Luckily, the movie kept my attention by headlining the film with such great talent as 1980's rap stars The Fat Boys (stars of Disorderlies and Shaft: Interpret That as a Sex Reference Because this is a Porno), and Motley Crue drummer, Tommy Lee.An imperfect film, but clearly a good, honest effort. I even wrote a letter to the studio and told everyone how much I admired their work. They clearly didn't have the budget of the first one yet managed to make a movie almost exactly as long as the original. There's this great thing the fattest rapper does whenever he sees an alien (they never show the aliens, I guess a budget thing) his eyes get real big and he goes running away, arms flapping screaming 'Aaaaallllien!!! Aaaaaallllien!!!' He does this thirty or forty times and in fact these scenes make up the bulk of the cinematic narrative. There are also a series of very innovative scenes done entirely in an improvised, rhyming rap style: Fat Boy 1: 'I knew it! The damn President is from Venus!'Fat Boy 2: 'Yo, spew it! Let's cram peppermint between us! Fat Boy 3: 'Don't je w it! Ham is a resident of my penis!' Tommy Lee: 'Don't look at me, man. I don't even wanna fu ckin' be here.' And so on, the rhyming sort of petering out until they all stand around in silence and eventually wander off the set. Some will criticize but try making a movie yourself! It's hard! So a few flaws, but definitely worth the buck rental price.I give it two smilies! :D :D",Null,1,2,26 November 2006
The Green Mile," A wacky, zany film
","Rob Schneider Meryl Streep Funnyman Rob Schneider brings his wacky talents to the big screen in The Green Mile, the wacky misadventure of a down-and-out prison worker forced to become a male prostitute in order to pay off a debt.The story begins when Miles Green (Schneider) accidentally kills a prisoner in a wacky mishap. The prison demands that Miles pay $500.00, or face being fired. He is given two weeks to repay the debt.Miles realizes what he must do when he runs into a friend who operates a wacky prostitution ring in the prison. Miles Green renames himself 'Miles O'Smiles' and begins offering himself as a gigolo. That's when the real wackiness begins, as Miles runs into one customer after another, each with some kind of bizarre, wacky disorder. One girl even has a wacky sleeping disease, where she falls asleep at random times! Hilarious! There's even a scene where they go bowling, and she falls asleep just as she's about to roll the ball, and she goes flying and well, it's just funny as heck. It's truly a wacky, wacky film.There has been lots of talk about The Green Mile sweeping the Oscars, and I agree. I have been a long-time fan of Schneider's, from this days at SNL when he did that character who said everybody's name funny (Tom! Tommy! Tom-arino!) to when he brought the Sly Stallone actioner Judge Dredd to life with his wackiness. But The Green Mile is a new level for him, and I for one and hoping we see a lot more Rob Schneider in the future.This is truly a wacky, wacky, wacky, zany film. I give it one star.",Null,5,10,26 November 2006
The Matrix," A lot of fun.
","Keanu Reeves Carrie Anne Moss Laurence FishburneThe Matrix is the beautifully-filmed remake of the lyrical 17th century french play isolée la fleur, in which a man becomes trapped inside a massive computer simulation, and must fight to free himself and his fellow man.Keanu Reeves (Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure) and Lawrence Fishburne (Booty Masters) turn in excellent performances as Neo and Morpheus, two souls locked in battle with the Matrix. The story unfolds when Neo, a typical male computer hacker (fit, good-looking, great fashion sense) meets Trinity, a typical female hacker (also good-looking, fit, wears tight leather). She reveals to him the awful truth of the Matrix, that life is merely a computer simulation meant to fool humanity.Neo realizes that he is the key to unlocking the Matrix - but this is where the film slows down a bit. Neo finds that the only way to defeat the Matrix is to write a virus that will destroy it from within. We then spend the next hour and twenty minutes watching Neo code a virus in C++, a long, tedious process that could have been left unfilmed. In scene after scene we watch him type, type some more, look up the Matrix's packet transport protocols, type, get a snack, type...You get the picture. Only after this does Neo realize there is another way to defeat the Matrix: by killing everyone attached to it. However, he must kill each person in a new and different way - each killing more spectacular than the last.In the final act of the film, Neo arms himself with dozens of machine guns and goes about killing all six billion people attached to the Matrix. After this is accomplished, humanity (the five remaining humans) is finally free.I question the moral sent by the third act (does violence really ever solve anything?) but it sure is fun to watch. I also learned some valuable lessons about coding software from the first half of the film, and got some fascinating insight into the world of computer hackers: all of them are cool, good-looking killing machines with great bodies. Rarely have hackers ever been portrayed so accurately on film.A classic. I give The Matrix two stars.**",Null,0,1,26 November 2006
