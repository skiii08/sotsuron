Sucker Punch," The child of Inception after a long night of naughty, naughty group sex with the Anime Section!
","I'm sure a lot of people will dislike this movie because it throws everything at us but the kitchen sink (and throws that too) and its ending. The professional & semi-professional critics certainly haven't been impressed. But I had a lot of fun until near the end and that counts for something.We get hot babes using kung-fu moves, swords and almost every gun ever made short of lasers is used. There are giant samurai, zombie Nazis, a big mecha suit, orcs, robots, armored knights, a huge fire breathing dragon,all kinds of air-vehicles, a train on a floating tracks, jetpacks, a bombastic rock score, and explosions of varying sizes.Is it overkill? Maybe. The movie runs two hours and takes a simple story of young women trying to escape an asylum and throws in whatever it can, taking us into not one, but two levels of dreamworld/fantasy in a way strangely similar to 'Inception'. And since this is the first film Synder made that ISN'T an adaptation, it's the first time he is able to give a movie a moral...though it doesn't come through as strongly as he may have intended.The cast is game, but they are often swept away in the comic book/video game mayhem. At the top is Scott Glen as the wise man who acts as Baby Doll's 'little voice' & gives the girls assignments that parallel to their escape plans. He seems to be having good time with it. On the bottom is Vanessa Hudgens, whose character does little & is the last likable of the heroines and tries too hard to wring out a big performance from a fairly small role. Everyone else falls somewhere in between between. Emily Browning is good to look at with her pigtails and school girl style outfit (she kinda looks like Sailor Moon, especially in one outfit she wears near the end) and she gives an earnest performance, there's something off about her I can't quite put my finger on...Unfortunately, the story takes a tragic turn in the third act after all the over the top action that hurts it. And the ending, while satisfying (to me anyway) was far from what I was expecting (though to be fair, the film own trailers warned we wouldn't see it coming).If you just want to watch a movie for a good time & to be entertained, you will be (especially those of you are good at riffing). But don't expect to leave the theater on the kind of high one gets from seeing a summer blockbuster...",7,2,7,27 March 2011
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," To think I was worried
","As a fan of the musical, I was both excited and worried to hear that it was finally being filmed. I was excited because a one of the greatest and daring musicals ever would finally be given the put on the silver screen for all the world to see and worried because there were a lot of things that could go wrong. When I heard Tim Burton would be directing, I felt it was in good hands because if anyone could get the dark look and tone of the musical, it would be him. Escpecially since he is a life long fan of the show who's seen every performance he could since it premiered on Broadway in 1979. However, when I heard that Johnny Deep would be playing the title character, I thought 'uh-oh'. Having a man who's never sung in his life play the lead character in a musical doesn't necessarily mean it will be bad to begin with (look at how things worked out for Rex Harrison in MY FAIR LADY or Marlon Brando in GUYS AND DOLLS), but I couldn't help but worry. And I became concerned as I heard about the rest of the casting, including Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett. So in the months of production, I listened for any news I could about the film and its star's singing abilities, which were kept under wraps. The fact that the trailers focused more on the horror aspects of the show didn't help. But now that I've finally seen the film for myself, I can breathe a huge sigh of relief in knowing one of my favorite musicals was done justice on the screen. The story: a London barber is unjustly imprisoned by a corrupt judge and is sent to an Austrailian prison for 15 years. He escapes and returns to London to reunite with his family, only to find out it was the destroyed by the judge. He vows revenge, but soon targets all of society and his partner in crime uses the bodies of his victims to help her poor meat pie business.It looks great. The film's production team painstakingly recreate Dickens-era London in all its squalid glory, mostly using actual buildings and cobble stone streets in favor of the overused CGI Hollywood is addicted to these days. And the costumes and rooms look so authentic I wondered if they didn't actually buy and repair centuries old clothes.And how did Johnny do? For starters, he looks the part. With his pale complexion, the dark circles around his eyes, and his wily black hair with white streak, he looks like a Victorian mad man. But how's his singing? Well, he doesn't have the big, boisterous, Broadway-style singing voice of the major actors who've played Sweeney in the past, but he makes it work. Instead he has a usually quiet, somewhat punk rock style voice that he makes very good use of. When he sung to his razors in the song 'My Friends' I got chills. And he did just great on 'Epithany', where Todd loses what sanity he has and vows to kill everyone he can.Helena, however, left somethings to be desired. She looked the part with her frizzled hair and long, ruffled dresses. She's not nearly as good a singer but she has her moments. As for the rest of the cast, they're all very good. Alan Rickman makes the corrupt Judge Turpin loathsome and despicable, Timothy Spall is a mean ass Beadle Bamford, and Sacha Baron Cohen makes wonderful use of his short role as the flamboyant, conceited, greedy Pirelli.Then there's the newcomers. I have to give Burton a lot of credit for having the show's young characters played by actors that are more or less the right age. Jayne Wisener is a pretty Johanna and she sings a good rendition of 'Green Finch, Linnet Bird' (no small feat considering this is one of the show's least popular songs), but her character does less here than on stage, so it was hard for me to really judge her. Jamie Campbell Bower struck me as a strangely pretty take of Anthony, but then again he did look 'fresh faced' and he can really sing. But the best one is Ed Sanders. When I heard that Toby was being played by a kid, I was a little uncertain of how to take it, as the character has always been played by young men who simply looked youthful. But young Mr. Sanders does a wonderful job, bringing humor and pathos to every scene he's in, whether it be hawking fake hair tonic in 'Perilli's Miracle Elixer' or singing a moving song of devotion with 'Not While I'm around' or just swilling gin with the best of 'em. With a good agent, this kid could have a future in the movies.Fans of the musical will lament the many, many cuts of material lost in the transition from stage to screen, but I was okay with most of them. Many made sense and there were some I even saw coming. The only ones I really miss are the chorus in 'God That's Good!' and the Judge's version 'Johanna', which both disturbing and fascinating at the same time.All in all, a great adaptation of a great musical. Well done, Mr. Burton, very well done.",10,7,13,31 December 2007
Tangled," Brings back that old fashioned Disney Magic
","I have to admit I wasn't impressed by the trailers & commercials for this movie, which made it look like another 'Shrek' wannabe, full of slapstick and snarky characters. However, I liked what I saw of Rapunzel and animals and heard good things about it from those in the know, so I gave it a shot. I'm very glad I did.It takes us back to the time when Disney was at their best. I felt like I did the first time I watched the classics like 'Aladdin', 'Beauty and the Beast', and 'The Little Mermaid'. And that's a good thing. It may sound like too much praise, but in this era of animated movies more interested in pop culture references and wacky (read: grating) antics than good stories and memorable characters, we could really use more cartoon movies like the ones of old.Even the opening narration reminded me of old-school Disney in how it told us the back story in its older movies. And I like how we get a different take on the story of Rapunzel, changing her from a farmer's daughter who ended up in the hands of a witch to a princess kidnapped to keep a woman (I wouldn't really call her a witch) young, and instead of a prince we get a thief forced to take her from that tower.The characters are the best we've gotten from a non-Pixar Disney movie it a while. Rapunzel makes a good heroine. With big green eyes and 70 feet of golden hair, she's more engaging than Snow White and Aurora, as wide-eyed and venturesome as Ariel and Belle, and as clever as Mulan. And she's wonderfully versatile with that hair, like Indiana Jones with a built in whip, or Wonder Woman's lasso as a part of her body. Mother Gothel, like Disney's very best villains, is unassuming while manipulative, cunning and, above all else, cruel and self-serving. We get really good sidekicks in the animals. They don't talk (which I'm glad of), but communicate greatly via facial expressions, gestures, and body language. Pascal the chameleon has a good sense of comic timing and his color changing adds to his communication. Meanwhile, Maximus the horse steals every scene he's in, acting more like a dog than a horse, putting up a better fight than the castle guards, and even having some interesting depth. The one character I didn't like was Flynn. Having seen a lot of him in the trailers, I thought he'd be a weak link. And I was right. Not only is his storyline all too familiar, but I've seen his kind in several Dreamworks movies (starts out selfish, snide and scheming then gets better over time). He's basically a pretty Shrek, or one the heroes of 'Eldorado' (he even kinda looks them)This is the second Disney animated movie since 'Mulan' to have song & dance numbers, and most of them are pretty good, bringing back memories of 'The Litte Mermaid' and 'Aladdin', which isn't surprising with Alan Menken in charge of music. The best one is the reprise of 'Mother Knows Best' (once again, the Villain gets the best song!). And I should warn you about the weakest, 'I've Got a Dream', which is supposed to emulate ensemble numbers of cartoons movies past, but is just too over the top and silly for its own good.I'll admit its not groundbreaking like Disney Classics of old. But after a decade of many failures, including a few that were close but still missed the mark, this is the kind of movie that made Disney all those years ago with great animation, colorful characters (literally in Pascal's case), and a story that nicely mixes romance, comedy, adventure and heart. This is Disney at its best. And we need more like it.",9,2,5,28 November 2010
Pacific Rim," Epic Idea...Lousy Execution...
","Robots vs. Giant Monsters? What could possibly go wrong? How about bad acting, bad pacing, shallow and clichéd characters, and long stretches between action that feel like they're from another movie? Heck, it'll almost feel like you're watching a sequel to an earlier movie. I get that they wanted to put us in the middle of the story to better catch our attention and intrigue, but it would've been nice to see more of the start of the war instead of a summary. Therein lies one of the movie's main problems: it's rushed in some place...and slow in others. The other problem? The characters are paper thing cutouts we've seen before, and better.This is also displayed very early in when we meet our hero, Raleigh Becket, and his brother. They literally start their day battling a kaiju...and Raleigh's brother is killed. Thing is, we never learn anything about him other than he's the older brother and that's it. There's no reason to be sad when he's killed. Raleigh misses him deeply, but the audience isn't given any reason to miss him at all. Likewise, most of the other 'Jaeger' pilots are just...there. They don't have any personality and play a ridiculously small role for people piloting giant robots to fight monsters. The ones that do have some personality/play a role are one-note stereotypes we've seen before.The only other pilot who really stands out is Mako Mori. She's given the most depth & backstory...but it's sadly undermined by Rinko Kikuchi's performance. And wouldn't ya know it, she and Raleigh have a romantic subplot that's dull and fairly intrusive. Raleigh himself is a boring, clichéd, unlikable hero. He has no personality other than being your standard issue fighting ace who fell from grace, but still has amazing, almost superhuman skills. That's all there is to him and we never really learn any more than that. It doesn't help that Charlie Hunnam is just another action movie star who'd skills seem limited to shouting, scowling, and smirking.Luckily, there's some good supporting players. Iris Elba gives the movie's best performance as the team leader Commander Pentecost. Ron Pearlman seems to be enjoying himself as (the snazzy dressed) black marketer Hannibal Chau. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman bring some energy & comic relief as a pair of scientists (though they can be kind of annoying)Thing is, it really could've all turned out better. The Kaiju are massive and bestial and look as fearsome as giant monsters would be if they were real.The Jaegers all have unique designs and abilities to help them standout (even if their pilots don't). The battles between them are fast, brutal and bombastic and are indeed the highlight of the film,especially in some pretty good 3D. Unfortunately, when there isn't any Kaiju vs. Jaeger action, it's as boring as a movie about cities being destroyed in battles between giant monsters and robots can be...",6,5,15,12 July 2013
Batman Begins," They finally got Batman right!
","At first, I wasn't that excited about BATMAN BEGINS. I was even worried. I really like Batman, but all of his movies had something wrong with them. Let's review.BATMAN: Was real good back in its day, but Micheal Keaton was looked like a wimp out of costume and Jack Nicholson's over the top Joker stole the show (but not in a good way) BATMAN RETURNS: Gave us Michelle Phiffer's near perfect Catwoman and the love/hate relationship between her and our hero. But was held down by a kinda mean, disturbing plot and Danny Devito's gross Pengiun.BATMAN FOREVER: Suffers from some silly sets and props and the villains (Jim Carrey's Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones' Two-Face) were ridiculous, but is picked up some by the relationship between Batman and Robin. And Val Kilmer deserved an Oscar for doing a good job both in and out of costume AND keeping a straight face during the sillier parts.BATMAN AND ROBIN: Everything that could have gone wrong with 'Batman' did. The plot was bad, the acting and dialog were terrible, the costumes uninentionally hilarious, Gotham City became Garish City, and they ruined FOUR classic characters in one movie; villains Mr. Freeze, Poison Ivy, and Bane were made laughable and what they to Batgirl was sacrilege.So I took BATMAN BEGINS and its hype cautiously. But then I read some good critic reviews and saw some clips that intrigued me. I went into the theater keeping my expectations in check.And you know what? It was better than I had ever hoped. For starters, they did the smart thing and retold Batman's origin from the ground up. We've been told or reminded why Bruce Wayne decided to dress up as a bat a hundred times before, but here they do in way that shows Batman's origins in a whole new light. Having him trained to be a ninja by a vigilante/terrorist group actually make some sense. The only thing that would have made those training scenes perfect was if the guy training Bruce had said that old comic quote that 'criminals are a superstitious,cowardly lot.' It also doesn't hurt that the murder of Mr. and Mrs. Wayne is (finally) done in a way that makes even casual fans more sympathetic toward young Bruce's plight. Villainy is finally done without the bad guys acting like buffoons from a Seventies cartoon. When I heard the Scarecrow was going to be the villain, I thought 'Oh no!'. I've never been able to take him seriously, even if his fear toxins get the job done. Afterall, how many times have you seen one of those over-sized rag-dolls actually work? I was even more nonplussed when I heard that Ra' Al Ghul, one the all time great BM villains was going to be involved too. While Ra's Al Ghul didn't get a big a role as I would have liked, he's done very well. But I was amazed at how great the Scarecrow turned out to be. Even before he puts on his costume, Dr. Jonathon Crane is one creepy guy. He's even man enough to admit his scarecrow mask isn't much to look at, but the hallucination inducing fear toxin he sprays at people really helps make him very menacing. What also helps is that several 'Batman' supporting characters are finally given their due. Commissioner Gordon (or here, DETECTIVE Gordon) is the hard hitting 'good cop' out catching crooks he's supposed to be. Micheal Cane is perfect as Alfred the butler. And Morgan Freeman is Batman's Q, supplying him with high tech gadgets, the stuff for the Bat costume, and even a souped up Batmobile. The worst part of the movie? Katie Holmes You don't believe for minute she'd be a good District Atorney, assistant or the real thing. She's more 'whiny' than 'rightous'. And the romance angle doesn't work at all. But everything else is done pretty good. From the exciting action scenes to the moody, Gothic look to the best looking Batsuit ever, this the way Batman should be done.",9,0,0,3 August 2005
Wreck-It Ralph," Best. Video Game Movie. Ever!
","From beginning to end, I was most entertained by this movie. Seriously, seeing the Disney Animation Studio logo done 8-bit style with the Steamboat Willie theme in 'bleep-bloop' sounds let me know it was going to an interesting evening.The world of Wreck-It Ralph is fun and imaginative as such a place would be, with video game characters of every occupation and species mingle when their games aren't being played. There are real video game characters (though some are more recognizable than others) mixed with original ones. There are cameos from Q-Bert, Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac Man, the heroes of Street Fighter and more, as well numerous subtle references to video game lore.The title character is the giant villain from 'Fix-It Felix Jr.' (which bears several resemblances to the original arcade version of Donkey Kong). Thing is, Ralph is tired of being the bad guy after thirty years and countless defeats of being thrown into a puddle of mud from the top of a high-rise apartment building and going home alone to the dump at the end of day while Felix gets praise, medals, and pies. Now he wants some respect and better treatment. One night things get out of hand and Ralph sets out to earn a medal of earn the respect of Felix and the Nicelanders. He finds his chance when he learns of a first person shooter called 'Hero's Duty' but ends up biting off more than he can chew. He then accidentally arrives in 'Sugar Rush', a parody of cutesy kart racing games where the characters aren't quite as sweet as their candy themed world would make you think.Aside from its fantastical world and settings, the movie greatly benefits from some stellar voice work. John C. Reily makes Ralph sympathetic and likable, but with a temper that gets him in trouble. Jack McBrayer plays Felix as an amiable, if not misguided, do-gooder who often talks like a character from the Andy Griffith Show. Jane Lynch is a hoot as Heros' Duty heroine Sgt. Calhoun, a send up of nonsense, tough as nails video game protagonists (complete a tragic backstory that's kind of funny in how over the top it is). Alan Tudyk channels the spirit & voice of late comic actor Ed Wynn in his performance as King Candy, Sugar Rush's seemingly goofy (but scheming) ruler.The weak link is Sarah Silverman as Vanellope Von Schweetz. The character herself is intentionally annoying, at least in her early scenes, but her storyline is actually quite touching. She just wants to race with the other Sugar Rush characters, but is ostracized and bullied for being a glitch. Fate forces her and Ralph to work together, and watching them bond is kind of stirring. But Silverman make the character more annoying than she needs to be.Also, the story kinda loses steam in the third act thanks to staying in one place for too long. As well a certain plot twist near the end. To be fair, there is some foreshadowing and hints, but there's a fine line between 'Didn't see that one coming!' and 'Wait, what?' and this twist (and a later one tied to it) come dangerously close.With its multiple settings in an innovative & imaginative world, colorful (both ways) cast of characters, and plethora of video game references, this is a fun movie for gamers and casual moviegoers alike.",9,3,3,11 November 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Enjoyable, but not quite as good as LOTR
","Peter Jackson's 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is an uneven start of the journey of the Hobbit Trilogy that is filled with both good and bad moments that will appeal and appall casual viewers and Tolkienites alike. There is a good movie & story to be found here, but Jackson and New Line Cinema overreached and the results are a mixed bag.Making a movie for each book in the 'Lord of the Rings' series was a smart move. Making a trilogy out of the simpler, more straightforward 'The Hobbit' is an odd one. No doubt New Line wants to recapture the magic (pun partially intended) of LOTR, as well milk Tolkien's work as much as they possibly can. There are scenes and elements to tie the two stories together and even elements from other Tolkien works like. Even things that got a passing reference in the book are fleshed out more here. Perhaps too much...A prime example would be Azog. In the book he's only mentioned two or three times and was a footnote. In the movies he's Thorin's sworn enemy in an attempt to give this trilogy a central villain. An attempt that doesn't really work as good as likely intended...Likewise, events that were mentioned but not seen in the book (and the previous version of TH from the 70s by Ranking & Bass Animation) are given the full treatment here. This was to be expected when you think about how battles in LOTR was to long and eventful. For example, it was mentioned that Gandalf & the Dwarfs had to fight there way out of Goblin Town and one HAD to expect the movie to show it. True enough, it's an eventful combo of chase and battle reminiscent of Indiana Jone or The 'Pirate of the Caribbean' movies. I liked it, but I'm not sure others will. And I'm sure everyone expected a flashback of how Smuag took Lonely Mountain to literally start the story with a bang.There are cameos by Frodo (Elija Wood), Galadriel (Cate Blanchete), Saruman (Christoper Lee) and Ian Holm as the older Bilbo to strengthen ties between the two series, some Sauron foreshadowing (including saying his presence is what made Mirkwood murky), and they even go so far as to say that Gandalf helped the dwarfs because he was concerned about Smaug would side with the baddies later. Radagast has small roles in other Tolkien stories but didn't appear in the original book. Here he is almost a different character, has quite a role and may help out more later.The real problem is that it tried to hard to be like LOTR. Thorin ends up being an Aragon expy and it very different from the book and cartoon movie and there were several scenes that gave me deja vu. And I really didn't want to feel that here...Some may grouse about the movie having too much comedy, but I'll give that a pass since Tolkien originally wrote TH to be a more lighthearted, fun story than LOTR, even if things get kinda of sitcommy at times.'I think the worst is behind us' Bilbo says just before the ending. I thought, 'I sure hope so...'",7,2,10,16 December 2012
Bolt," A Doggy 'Don Quixote'
","It's been a long time since I've wanted to see a Disney movie that didn't have Pixar or Hayao Miyazaki attached to it. For whatever reason, the past several films Disney has made by themselves have failed to live up to the standard of classics like SNOW WHITE, PINNOCHIO, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and THE LION KING, to name a few. Only time will tell if BOLT will be lucky of enough to held anywhere near the regard those movies are, but it's certainly a step in the right direction.I'll go ahead and admit it's nothing that hasn't been done before (just once can't we have talking animal movie that doesn't involved a journey of some kind where the characters learn things about themselves and some life lessons?), but it has so much humor and heart that makes up for it's clichés.The movie sure starts out good enough, with little Penny getting Bolt, a frisky and active puppy, from a pet store in a scene I thought was kinda sweet. Then we flash forward 5 years later to the action parts. As you probably know by now, Bolt is the star of his own action/science fiction TV show, where he uses super powers to regularly save Penny from the henchmen of the evil Dr. Calico. The tone setting scene for the show is like an entertaining cross between Lassie, James Bond and a little of the Matrix Trio (only better). Only Bolt doesn't know it's fake, as the studio does what they can to make him think he really is a super dog in order for him to give a better performance. The situation is made a little worse because Calico's cat (who's in on the sham) taunts him nightly for fun. There's also the fact that he and Penny really care for each other, having a relationship I found fairly touching and doubt most Timmies and Lassies ever had.One day, the show ends shooting with a cliffhanger and Bolt escapes his trailer to rescue Penny only to end up in a box that's shipped from Hollywood to New York. With the 'advice' of some pigeons, he takes a stray cat named Mittens hostage and forces her to help him get back to Hollywood & Penny and along the way they get help from a hamster named Rhino, who's a fan of the show.The movie is helped by a colorful cast of characters. Bolt is the canine version of Buzz Lightyear or Don Quixote, completely deluded into thinking his powers are real. Seeing him talk old fashioned heroic dialogue at the beginning of the movie bought a smile to my face, and then when he starts doubting his powers and finds out they aren't real, it brings some depth & pathos to his character. Mittens makes the perfect straight man to him early on, street wise and sarcastic, then helps him learn to act like a real dog. And then we learn something about her past that makes us feel some sympathy for her. Rhino is as delusional, if not more so, than his hero, and could be the kind of pudgy, excitable fan boy one encounters in real life at various convention. And Penny is a likable girl who truly cares for Bolt and is even forced to make some hard decisions about her feelings for him. And there's a good supporting cast, from the pigeons to Dr. Calico to his cats to Penny's Agent, who keep things lively. And it's made even better by the great voice acting of the cast.I'd like to talk about the great animation, but enough people have done that and all I'll say is that the animals, especially the pigeons, move like their real life counterparts.There are some pretty funny jokes here. Almost everything with Rhino and the pigeons will get some laughs. The pigeons are made funnier because different groups of three are encountered who have the same character design, but have different color schemes and accents. And for a while Bolt thinks his powers were taken away by the Styrofoam packing peanuts in the box he was shipped in and we get a clever running gag about Styrofoam being his kryptonite.My biggest gripe was said before, as we've seen the story before. And there are times in the middle it drags just a bit. And near the end, things got a little hokey for me.However, this is still the best non-Pixar movie Disney has made in years as far as I'm concerned. If they can keep it up, they can get back on the right track to being the kings of animations again.",8,3,5,30 November 2008
Guardians of the Galaxy," Liked it a LOT more than I thought I would!
","Marvel took a risk with 'Guardians of the Galaxy': it's based on a fairly obscure series about an obscure team made up of obscure characters. While the GotG comics have been around for decades, they just aren't as popular or well known as the X Men, the Avengers or Spider-man. On a related note, the team is made of up morally ambiguous, down & dirty, rough-around-the edges- characters characters who aren't quite upstanding role models like Wolverine, Captain America, and Spidey. Some might even say that Marvel was scraping the the bottom of the barrel, or at least getting close.Well, the risk paid off and there is indeed a reward. This is one the more fun--one could argue it's THE most fun--Marvel Comics movies. It feels like Indiana Jones or the Classic Star Wars Trilogy with colorful characters, thrilling action scenes that aren't so bombastic, and amusing banter. Things are even more fun thanks to a series of 70s hits played over the action at interesting times. The downside may be that it tries TOO hard to be fun, with the plot and humor getting in each other's way or how the more serious moments are almost out of place.Also...don't stick around for the post-credit scene this time. Just wait for the home media release. While other post-credit scenes in previous Marvel movies are interesting & intriguing, leaving you wanting more while setting up future installments, this one...doesn't. That's all I'll say to avoid spoilers.Few people may have been clamoring for a movie based on Guardians of the Galaxy, but many people will like the results. Now they may be clamoring for a sequel...",9,2,4,3 August 2014
The Dark Knight," Best Bat Movie Ever!
","Back in 2005, I saw 'Batman Begins' and fell in love with it: finally, a Batman that got the character and the world he lives in right, not a flawed live action cartoon. I thought things couldn't get any better.'The Dark Knight' has proved me wrong. And I'm glad of it.For starters, this does what it's predecessor did and treats Gotham City and its inhabitants as if it was a real place. Our hero's gear and equipment have real world origins and explanations, not just something he pulls out of his utility belt and starts doing amazing things with. There are scenes of people reacting to situations as you or I would do, not a bunch of extras following the director's instructions. And there are real world complications that that many other versions of Gotham City didn't seem to have.Since there are some are some big twists the trailers and commercials avoided showing us, I'll try my best to keep this spoiler free. But the results of those twists have such a great effect on the plot I might go into detail about them, so be warned.Let's start with the thing on everyone's mind and talk about the late Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker, not the mention the character himself. This is not your father's Joker. Everything about him is changed, right down to his origin. Instead of a career criminal who fell into a vat of chemicals that altered his appearance, we have have a psychopath with unique scars wearing clown make up. There are no gimmicky weapons here: no killer laughing gas, no electrifying joy buzzers, no acid squirting flowers, no guns with BANG flags. This Joker uses a variety of guns, knives and bombs that any criminal really could find and use. And he's no longer a criminal mastermind out to get as much money as possible and have fun committing crime. He's out to cause chaos and panic for his own twisted amusement, his attacks becoming increasingly destructive and deadly as they happen in ways that rival real world terrorist attacks. Later in, he's out to make turn the people of Gotham bad, forcing common citizens to do unthinkable acts in response to his terrible demands. And Ledger brings the character to life in way no other actor has ever done or will. The rumors he may win a posthumous Oscar have much truth to them. If you're one of those people who've always thought Jack Nicholson's Joker from the 1989 'Batman' was over the top and cartoonish, then watch 'The Dark Knight' for the complete opposite.But Ledger isn't the only one doing a wonderful job here. Christopher Bale remains the best Bruce Wayne/Batman ever. Micheal Caine brings both humor and sincerity to Alfred. Morgan Freeman wonderfully shows us the mind (and heart) behind the Batsuit and those weapons and equipment. Gary Oldman gives one of the best performances in his entire career as a stalwart James Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a vast improvement over Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes. Aaron Eckhart brings charisma and courage to his role as Harvey Dent, which makes Dent's transformation to the scarred villain Two Face all the more horrifying and tragic (something Tommy Lee Jones didn't even try to do when he played the character in 1995's 'Batman Forever'). Even anonymous characters that only get a few minutes of screen time manage to leave an impression.But be warned: this movie lives up to its PG-13 rating. The violence here is fast and brutal. And even when bullets aren't flying and bombs aren't exploding, the tension is so thick it'll take a lot more than a knife to cut it. There are several jump out of your seat moments and some fairly disturbing scenes. During the last 30 minutes or so, I was on the edge of my seat, my heart constantly pounding and my eyes wide as I hoped for the best but expected the worse. If you have young Bat-Fans, you might want to pause before taking them to see this, or buying the DVD for them when it comes out. Even though the movie has toys and snack food tie ins, I wouldn't let a child under 11 or 12 see this. I imagine even some adult viewers won't be able to sit trough it without squirming in their seats a few times.My one true complaint is that 'The Dark Knight' maybe TOO good, setting the mark a little too high for future Batman Movies. Even if they could find someone to replace Ledger to bring back the Joker, I'm not sure that actor could possibly fill the large shoes left to fill.'I think you and I are destined to do this forever' The Joker leers at Batman at one point. If only that were true...",10,3,7,27 July 2008
WALL·E," Little Robot, Big Heart
","Pixar's newest film, 'Wall-E', is sure to go down in history as animated masterpiece alongside the 'Toy Story' duo, 'The Incredibles', and 'Finding Nemo'.For starters, the animation is just gorgeous. Which is really saying something when the first part of the movie takes place world that is a barren, trash filled waste land. Unlike so many films from their animation rivals where everything is bright and crisp, the artists at Pixar always add real world textures to everything they make. Just think about the water in 'Finding Nemo' or the food in 'Ratatouille'. While we are taken to a place where everything is smooth and well polished later, I was more impressed by how they were able to make everything dirty, rusty and dented...including our hero.Wall-E himself is one of the most lovable animated characters I've seen in years. Unlike so many 'whacky', 'zany' cartoon characters who are annoying, obnoxious and almost soulless, Wall-E is able to emote and make us like him without saying a word. Well, he does say a few words, but they're so few and far between he's practically a silent film star for the 21st century, wonderfully using his eyes, hand gestures, and body movements. The same can be said for Eve, the probe driod who steals his heart (or is it motor?). It is interesting to see them together just because they're so different: he's old (maybe even ancient), clunky, dented and dirty as a machine can be while still working while she's sleek, fast and brand new. The two of them make a good couple, first as a comedy duo with Wall-E as the clown and Eve as the straight man, then as friends, then as lovers. There is even a scene of them 'dancing' in space which culminates with the robot equivalent of a kiss. The love story in 'Wall-E' wonderfully accomplishes what so many romantic comedies try and fail to do, and I'm not even sure Pixar realizes it!I also really like the film's messages, which are ones we don't see very often and fairly bold. Most kids & family movies (including Pixar's previous works) use morals about friendship, family, honesty, being true to yourself, etc. There's nothing with that. In fact, it should a good way to impart some important information onto young viewers. But we've seen them all so many times those messages have lost some of their meaning. And sometimes those meanings tend to unfortunately get lost amid the slapstick, crude humor, action scenes, and pop culture references that much of today's family entertainment falls victim to. Not here. The first, most obvious message has to do with the environment: the Earth of the future is a barren garbage dump with no plants or water and Wall-E has made 'stacks' of crushed and cubed garbage that are taller than sky-scrapers and the only animal we see is a lone cockroach.But the movie took me by surprise when it started to show us something about today's society. The story takes us to the giant spaceship Axiom where humanity now lives and here the human race has evolved into a race of pudgy, pampered people who sit in hover chairs and very rarely get out of them, have robots do every single thing for them except eat/drink 'food in a cup' (all junk food, at that), talk to each other via holographic screens instead of face to face even when the person they're talking to is nearby, have no knowledge of their surroundings (they spend hours lounging by the pool without even realizing there is a pool there, let alone trying to swim) or history, and the corporation that built the ship (and ruined Earth) tells them what to do via ads in place of a government. The scary thing is that there are several eerie parallels between the society of the Axiom and the one here in the real world that make me wonder about the real fate of mankind.For the life of me, I can't think of a single flaw with 'Wall-E'. From the animation to the characters to the story, everything about it is so great I can't think of anything wrong with it. Not only will this be one of the best movies, animated or live action, of 2008, it will be one of the best movies of all time.",10,2,4,2 July 2008
