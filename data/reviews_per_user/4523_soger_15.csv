The New World," The New Snooze... I mean World
","People say this movie is art. Well... it is in a sense that for one and a half hours you watch 10 pictures about the nature and some half naked body painted indigenous Americans. Whoops, was that a spoiler? The remaining half our is the actual movie which was not really interesting. It was full with cheesy monologues saying 'I Love You'. I still watched the whole movie because an IMDb comment said that it had an interesting ending. Well, it wasn't, just more cheesiness. I actually wrote documentation during the movie just to keep myself from falling down the chair. In under no circumstance watch this movie in a cinema because there is nothing else to do in there and you cannot turn off the projector.",2,1,1,10 August 2008
United 93," A very good fiction story
","I have to tell you that just because of the last 20 minutes this movie is worth watching. It is so intense, you don't see scenes like that in every movie.However!The story of the movie is extremely unreal. I know this was the official version of what happened in 9/11/2001 but this is too surreal. The only intelligent people in this movie were the people on the plane including both the passengers and the hijackers. But there is no way airlines could oversee 4200 planes if they were this inordinate dumbs. And good luck for a country that has such a helpless incapable air force. I refuse to believe that after two planes has crashed into the WTC the US air force still cannot send fighters to intercept the rest of the hijacked commercial planes. I beg you people out there, don't believe everything you see in the television, someone is trying to fool you.One final note: if you like this movie and you are now considering watching 'World Trade Center', please don't. That's really just the story of two cops stuck under a pile of rocks, it has not much to do with 9/11.",8,0,5,8 October 2008
Cloverfield," A really absorbing movie
","People keep comparing this movie to Godzilla and The Blair Witch Project. I saw neither of those but after seeing this movie I felt compelled to watch them so I did. THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE GODZILLA. The only thing in common with Godzilla is the big ass monster and the running people. It is similar to the Blair Witch Project in style, tension and uncertainness but Godzilla (1998) is more similar to Jurassic Park with the dinosaurs and a final conclusion. Cloverfield is something else.People either love or hate this movie. To tell you the truth I'm one of the people who love it but read other comments too, both sides are telling the truth. The reason I love it is because I saw no movie like this one before. The whole science-fiction story is presented from the perspective of a hand held camera. The camera itself is a super-advanced prototype that is unbreakable and has almost unlimited power and nightvision and everything but that's not the point. The point is that it creates a unique and absorbing tone. You don't really notice the special effects they are just part of the story like if they were filmed in reality and that is what makes it genius like in the show called 'Heroes'.So love it or hate it... doesn't really matter. What matters is that you will not be bored during this movie, not for one second. And it will stuck in your head for a while.",9,1,2,19 April 2008
28 Weeks Later," Bring on the horror!
","I love zombie movies in general. I loved Resident Evil, I am legend, Dawn of the Dead, etc. so one day a friend of mine recommended me this movie. I rented both 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. 28 Days Later was so good I could not wait so I watched 28 Weeks Later immediately. I watch a lot of horror movies so I thought nothing can scare me but I was wrong! This movie is horrifying! After the first few minutes the tension starts and it never drops. I was not prepared for this experience.I could not take my eyes off the screen for one second!If you read other comments people keep complaining that the characters of this movie behave illogically, and the plot has holes but who cares! It kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end. The zombies don't look so scary but their unstoppable violence makes them scarier then any special effect or visual effect can.",10,0,2,9 May 2008
Wanted," A good action packed movie with lots of flaws
","I saw the trailer of this movie so I could not wait to watch it. I pretty much got what I wished for; maybe even more. But I still subtracted 3 stars for the following two reasons:1) (-1 star) Lots of plot holes. If you want to know more read a comment that contains spoilers. I recommend the one entitled 'Why, why, why' from 30 June 2008.2) (-2 stars) The main character. People seem to like James McAvoy, but I really really don't. I think he cannot pull off a character like this. The movie shows some similarities to the first 'Matrix' (fortunately not too many) where Keanu Reeves COULD play a 'superhero'. Or check out 'Hancock' with Will Smith. That's a superhero! Even if in the beginning Hancock was a drunken bum. I think James McAvoy is even worse than Tobey Maguire in Spiderman. And his monologues are lame-lame-lame.The rest of the cast is OK, Angelina is perfect for the part and Morgan Freeman can play anything and anyone.Another small complain is the impossible action scenes. For example I made some trajectory calculations and it just doesn't come out. Even the ones that do are impossible to execute by a human. While this is not a flaw next time please put 'Sci-Fi' among the genre list.If you are a fan of action movies you should definitely watch this one.Update: after watching the movie for the 2nd time James McAvoy does not seem so bad so I raised my vote with one star. Another thing I noticed is that the headshots are extremely brutal. So go ahead and watch the DVD.Update2: after watching the movie for the manieth time I just realized it's kinda like a lite version of 'Fight Club' but in a more fantasy setting. It seems I like the movie even more every time I watch it.",8,2,5,7 August 2008
Tropic Thunder," An almost entertaining movie...
","This movie contains lots of excessive action and excessive humor; I guess the hole point of this movie is to entertain the people but it did not work for me.You can see lots of C4 explosions, M16 fire, RPGs but the story is a comedy, these two don't really mix. In addition the jokes are not the best. I never enjoyed the fart type comedy nor the type of dark humor where the people's hands fall off.Lots of big names in the cast, I would say it was a big waste too, no one can really show his talent in a sarcastic movie. I didn't even recognize Tom Cruise until he took his glasses off.I can see why many people enjoyed this movie but it was definitely not for me...",5,8,17,15 November 2008
Quantum of Solace," Not impressed at all
","Seriously, this is the new James Bond movie? James Bond movies were never my favorites but I still watched them for the action scenes, the cool gadgets and Bond's nonchalant elegance. This movie delivers only the action scenes but nothing you haven't seen before. So let me criticize some aspects:First of all, where are the gadgets??? Every super-agent should have and use them. This James Bond handles everything with a pistol and a mobile phone.Second of all Daniel Craig as James Bond? Who the hell decided that? His face has no character, he leaks the elegance necessary for this part, and THIS guy gets all the ladies? Come on, were there no better candidates?And last (but not concluded) MI6's computers. I know that the authors of the movie wanted something impressive. The Microsoft Surface is not such a big deal and there was the other computer that projected the information on the transparent wall of the office which, well... you could say that it is shiny and everything but the excessive flashing and the transparent screen (by letting you see what's behind the wall) distracts your attention from your work, so before you design a super-fancy computer think about how useful would it be in real life.",5,3,5,22 March 2009
Transformers," Just great
","My comment is this simple: this movie is 130 minutes of fun!My girlfriends says I'm a 26 years old boy. Well, if you are big boy too, you should definitely watch this movie. There are good jokes, soldiers are shooting evil robots, the robots transform to great cars and planes etc etc etc. The visual effect are perfect. I could not believe my eyes when Megatron transformed into a plane. And the interaction between humans and robots are also perfect; I have no idea how the visual effects were done. They are better then the visual effects in Heroes.Finally, after 8 years, there is a movie that can compete with 'The Matrix'.",10,3,6,3 September 2008
World Trade Center," The-story-of-two-cops-stuck-under-a-pile-of-rocks
","The dashes in my summary are there to emphasize that this should have been the movie's title. Well, yes, we see some images from the WTC tragedy but 90% of the movie is only about the two cops and their families.If the movie did not have the title 'World Trade Center' probably nobody would watch it. You remove a few minutes from the beginning and end of the movie and what you are left with is a below average drama with a happy ending. 9/11 was anything but a happy ending.The movie says nothing about the 'why'. I think in a tragedy like this the why is the most important. I don't want to start the whole zeitgeist thing again but come on! A movie about 9/11 and you show the triumph two cops. Shame on Oliver Stone.My biggest disappointment is that Nicolas Cage accepted a part in this movie. After movies like 'Next' how could he play in this one. He is one of my favorite actors but because of this movie I don't like him that much anymore.I actually got tired of people repeating 'I love you'. I have this gut feeling that the movie was only created to make some money off the people's commiseration.",2,0,1,3 September 2008
The Dark Knight," It felt so good
","Wow man, look at this rating: 9.1 out of 300000 votes? That cannot be an accident. And it isn't! I was afraid to watch the movie as usually 2nd parts tend to be worse than the first. Except for Alien and Terminator. And now we can add Batman to this thin list.Good special/visual effects, great cast, a pretty chaotic but not overcomplicated storyline and surprisingly good characters. I especially enjoyed Joker; Heath Ledger was so good I wish he won the Oscar for this part.The movie is simply brilliant, there is nothing more that needs to be said, just go and watch it for yourself but use the bathroom beforehand because you will be nailed to your chair for 144 minutes!",9,2,6,9 November 2008
Avatar," a unique experience on a visually fascinating fairy tale
","I gave to this movie a perfect 10 because it was very entertaining although it is not without it's shortcomings.Let's break up my summary into pieces:A unique experience because I was waiting for this movie for a really long time. In almost every sci-fi humans are the good guys with generally inferior technology. Well, not in this one.Visually fascinating because it is, you have to see it, you just have to, trust me. The flying and 'horse' riding scenes are very convincing but some of the body movement still needs some work, especially the bodies of the Omaticaya people. Another small issue is that I found a bit tiresome that on that planet everything was glowing even the grass they stepped on; this made the planet seem a bit artificial.A fairy tale because it is a nice fable but in reality the story wouldn't end like this; and this is where my SPOILER SECTION STARTS: it would have been really hard to destroy those V-22 Osprey-like aircrafts especially because of the miniguns so this is why I'm saying that it was a nice fairy tale: the good guys won, the bad guys were punished. Yeah..., yeah..., you can tell me that I'm a negative person, but I'm telling you even if the Omaticaya won that time, the next attack will be a lot shorter, it takes only one ballistic missile with a tactical nuclear warhead to destroy their oh-so-precious tree.",7,1,3,5 February 2010
In Time," Take the time to think about this movie
","I read some reviews and it seems to me that the people who like this movie are the ones that actually understand that this movie is not a sci-fi but a real life description dressed as a sci-fi.In many ways the movie is similar to Eagle Eye although it addresses a different issue. Eagle Eye talks about the problems with the politicians and the government while this movie is all about the problems with banks, inflation, money in general. Eagle Eye is also more subtle while this movie is a direct reflection of our current society in a futuristic sci-fi mirror. To say only one example: people die on the street because they 'time out'. Well, of course we don't have clocks built into our arms but people do die on the street because they have nothing to eat or they freeze to death etc. If you did not see this parallelism it's probably because you wanted some mindless entertainment with plasma rifles or something.So people, read between the lines.",8,0,0,31 March 2012
Joker," For the masses
","So this Joker character has nothing to do with the DCEU's Joker, the name and the Waynes and Gotham city is just added as a cheap shot to sell this no-so-good drama. And apparently it works, if you can believe the IMDb score. Probably because people go to a DCEU movie and instead they see two hours of whimpering that the rich are so evil and the government doesn't care about us and that's what sells these days.",3,9,23,10 December 2019
Iron Man," Excellent
","I had my doubts about writing another comment to this movie because there is more than 700 already so probably no one will read mine... Anyway... mine should also be here.I found this movie so entertaining that I feel I must persuade everyone to watch it. Especially if you liked Transformers then you definitely should watch this one, and if you didn't then you should still give this movie a shot.It was like watching Batman Begins, the birth of a superhero but with a lot greater visual effects. The movie is 2 hours long, that is a lot, but there are lots of action scenes so you won't get bored but there are also lots of quiet moments (sometimes even a bit romantic) so you won't get tired. I think the movie is perfect the way it is. I read some 'Hated it' comments 'cause I couldn't imagine why people don't like this movie. Well they don't really make strong points, most of them are simply saying that they hate it for no reason others say that the situation in Afghanistan is no joke. So what's new, everybody knows that war is no joke. The movie is not about discussing current political events, it's about the problem of double dealing of the weapon manufacturers with both parties of a war which result in one thing: the bankers and weapon manufacturers get richer and the ordinary people die.Anyway, go watch the movie NOW.",10,1,2,12 September 2008
Law Abiding Citizen," Worse ending than 'The Jackal'
","Remember 'The Jackal'? When the chick flick guy from 'Pretty Woman' defeats John McClane from 'Die Hard'? So far that movie had the worst ending, but as of now we have a new winner.I mean come on! A guy this prepared should have made sure the bomb detonates before it can be moved. And also he would have had a plan in place in case someone found his shelter.But nooooooo, the movie ends with killing our guy. Where is the justice in that? Where is any justice in that? Killing him was as illegal as any of the killings he did.But even in it's stupidity this movie teaches us a lesson (which may not even be the intention of the writer): the legal system is corrupt, useless and incapable but they kill anyone who tries to change it. How's that for a conclusion?",1,3,3,28 April 2011
