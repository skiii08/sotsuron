Blade Runner 2049," All i could ask was WHY?
","just to update myself, I watched the 82 version, since all the news was about what we learned from Blade runner 1st edition. Well, this movie is old. Looks to be a low budget B movie, for some reason the movie attracted big names in the acting field. So we move on to 2017 version, blade runner 2049. Again I am thrown into a low budget, bad acting, how and why would they not take advantage of this do over and actually make it better? yes, we know its a spin-off, a run along for the family type of film, but why?? They took trash and made more trash. After about 20 minutes off goes the movie, I was done back to watching Lost... They took an old guy did some bad makeup and still had an old guy... SO you don't waste 12 to 15$ on tickets at the theater, wait a few months it will be out on DVD or at the Drive-in and at least you can find something to do during the boring parts!",1,9,18,19 October 2017
Justice League," Actors Great, Everything else hmmm
","The Justice League. the actors were great! Blame the writers for this one. Too many rewrites of a script ended in already been done or already used technique available and they were making use of old ideas to save cash. I will watch it again. it's not a bad movie, just not worth 16$ at the box office! I do not know the backstory of all characters.",7,1,3,21 November 2017
