Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Unoriginal and vulgar
","The basic theme of this film (i.e. uninitiated foreigner trying to make his way in the USA, in a culture totally foreign to him) has been blatantly plagiarised from Crocodile Dundee. Even the scene where Borat is told how to use a western toilet was stolen from the Bidet scene in CD.There the similarity of the two films ends. Whilst Crocodile Dundee is charmingly funny, Borat relies on Racism, Sexism, and vulgarity to get cheap laughs. If you like scenes where obese, hairy, middle aged men wrestle naked, then I guess this one's for you. The fact that this particular scene continued for such an inordinately long time served to demonstrate the lack of original ideas that the film possessed. Personally, it put me right off my popcorn. Learn from my mistake and give this one a miss.",1,7,15,6 December 2006
