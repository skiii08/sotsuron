Howl's Moving Castle," Howl's Vain Imagination
","I think Howl is perhaps the most fascinating character in this film because the first impression I had of him was completely shattered as the story progressed. At first, he seems to be this sort of superhero, crime-fighterone that is confident, clever, and courageous. This was made seemingly apparent when he saves Sophie from the Witch of the Waste's minions lurking in the alley. After being harassed, Howl dashingly comes to Sophie's rescue, literally sweeps her off her feet, glides through the sky with her in arms, and safely carries her to the top of her home balcony. Immediately I thought, 'He's like a charming superman.' This impression was later changed quite dramatically when I realized how timorous Howl really istwo scenes in particular stood out.First, when Howl comes home after fighting the sky wars he appears exhausted, trudges through the hallways and collapses on a nearby chair. Sophie watches him with caring yet surprising eyes: she's never seen him look so un-gaudy before. Howl's entire body then starts to liquefy into this greenish slime as it drips onto the floorhe is wasted, disoriented. This was a particularly interesting shift in my perspective of him because he no longer carried that stereotype of the invincible superhero, but was subject to fatigue and pain. Secondthe more dramatic shiftwas during the scene when Sophie is talking to Howl sick in bed. Howl is complaining about how if he isn't beautiful there's no point to living. This was as shocking for me to hear as it was for Sophie. In this moment, the image of who we think Howl isthe chivalry knightturns out to be a vain, insecure and superficial child. Even Howl's living space suggests his vanity: filled with all sorts of golden shrines and jewelry, sculptures and other materialistic idols. All of these idiosyncrasies, though, really made Howl's character alive; believable; real. I mean, superheros are often thought to be omnipotent, fantastical and ones who perform the impossible. Though people are typically drawn to these types of superheroes, no one believes they actually exist in external reality.I think Miyazaki purposely made Howl first appear supernatural so that he could later break that stereotype and show that even real superheroes are subject to certain frailties. This way the audience can really identify, connect and feel empathy for Howl's character. All of us want to have superhuman strengths but all of us are bound by imperfections; we all want to appear strong and confident, yet we all struggle with things that we're embarrassed to admit to othersHowl is no different. His character reminded me of Steven Seagle's superman character in his graphic novel, 'It's a Bird.' One line from this novel reminded me of Howl's persona: Alternate universes remind us that super heroes do not come from distant planets, but are harvested on this planet as ones that can see past their own little world, and reach out beyond their limited scope of existence and help others.For Howl to conquer his weakness and to become a true superhero, the irony is that he has to help those around him break the spells they are seduced by; rather than focusing upon his own supposed ugliness. This is where Miyazaki's theme really hits home: that in order to become great and powerful (like a superhero) you have to help others become great and powerful. It wasn't only Howl that had to accomplish thisthey all did. Sophie helps Turnip become a prince; Howl helps Sophie become young again, etc. Howl's problem was that he was so self-consumed that he was blinded by how to properly wield his magical powers: he was immature. He was even warned by the queen that if he did not carefully temper his skills, he'd end up like the Witch of the Wastecorrupted. I think this is a really powerful theme because it clarifies several things. First, the importance of engaging in the relationships that surround us to get what we want; we can't isolate ourselves like hermits and throw pity parties like Howl did. Second, our need to bridle the gifts (i.e. superpowers) that come to us: not to abuse them or think we're better than others because we have them. If we do abuse them, we'll lose them like the Witch of the Waste.The use of animation also helps illustrate this theme more poignantly. It seems in my mind that to become a superhero you have to enter a different worldenter a different state of mind; one that is fantastical and chimerical. Animation typically has that effect on me. That is, I feel that I've entered a completely different world and state of mind when watching something animated. I think to heighten the sense of reality that these characters live in, Miyazaki used the fantastical world of animation to help the audience to not only feel that they are part of a superheroes world, but also that they feel like superheroes themselves.",6,0,1,1 February 2009
Citizen Kane," Theme through Music and Sound
","The theme of this film is supported through its use of music and sound: The self-centered attraction for money, power and materialism leads to a loss of childhood innocence, pollution of family, empty and shallow values, and an inevitable self-realization of retrospective regret. The opening scene begins with a darkening minor bass-horn which produces a cold, mysterious, and empty atmosphere. The viewer sees a mega-mansion in the background perched on top of a hill with a luminous light spilling out through an open window. As images of the mansion move closer and closer towards the window, the music crescendo's louder and louder and finally climaxes with a sudden bass/drum roll as the light turns off inside. The tension and release of the parallel music here suggests that something dramatic has, or is about to take place inside that room. It is a musical cue to what the viewer is about to uncoverthat is, the light of the world's largest newspaper tycoon has just turned off, or died. Diegetic and non-diegetic music is used frequently throughout the film to help convey the rise of Kane's empire of selfishness, his attraction for money and power, his manipulation on public opinion, and the pollution of his family. A diegetic song written specifically to hail Kane as a great newspaper publisher is sung during a banquet party his staff throws for him. Here Kane is seen as the center of attention as he dances with a group of women who flower over him and sing praises to his name. This song expressly demonstrates the rise of Kane's egotism. Even earlier in the film during the news reel sequence, a tapestry of events from Kane's life is displayed with non-diegetic drums and pompous horns to help reflect Kane's smugness towards money and power. During a time-lapsed sequence over Kane eating breakfast with his first wife, both mickey-mousing and non-diegetic elements are used to heighten the disintegration of his first marriage. Fast-paced camera swipes (accompanied with the tingling of bells and strings) are mickey-moused with the progression of each sceneshowing the further decay of their marriage each time. The non-diegetic music becomes more and more morose to enhance and foreshadow the inevitable divorce. Sound is also used to capture the empty and regretful life of Kane. During a particular scene with his second wife constructing a jigsaw puzzle, he engages her in a shallow conversation about not wanting to move to New York. As he walks through the immensely spacious halls of the mansion, their voices are heard deeply echoing off the empty and lonely wallsgiving the impression of isolation. This diegetic sound is to reflect Kane's inner emptiness and loss of personal childhood innocence to the debauchery of materialism. Sound becomes dramatic and crucial in the scene where Kane's second wife leaves him. As he tears apart the materialized and wealthy room he has built for her, foley sounds are heard emphasizing the crashing of chairs and shelves, and the ripping of pillows and blankets. The sound increasing here reflects Kane's retrospective regret in all that he has lost and also that which was most dear to him. The intensity of these sounds then contrasts perfectly when he picks up the snow-globeall sounds vanish. In the midst of silence, the viewer then hears a faint and muffled, 'Rosebud', from Kane's mouth. The sound of this word resonates with the viewer; echoing forth Kane's long-lost childhood to when he was first taken from the innocence and youth of his home and forced into the scandalous and corrupt world of politics and media.",10,6,8,3 December 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Jewish Fantasy Fulfilled?
","The long anticipated, ultra-violent spaghetti western riddled with WWII iconography is Tarantino's homage to the alleged Jewish fantasy: sadistically bludgeoning the Arian, Nazi race. We follow two savage forces—the Basterds and Shosanna—each who make separate attempts to destroy Hitler and his band of carnal cronies, thereby ending the war.Made with reminiscent traces of The Great Escape & The Dirty Dozen, not to mention the peppered cruelty of Hostel or any other torturous Eli Roth picture, Inglourious Basterds is a marvelously skewed alternative to how WWII should have ended, rather than how it actually did end. When it was over, I sat in the theater feeling sterile. Fruit could not be produced.In typical Tarantino form, the film was broken into five headlined chapters, was terribly verbose yet possessed witty dialogue on occasion, masked its bloody and grotesque content in beautiful aesthetics, flowered a pastiche of anachronistic musical melodies, and brought forth extremely rich & compelling character developments—all of which were mesmerizing. Christoph Waltz, in particular, gave a truly haunting performance, the best Nazi portrayal I've ever seen and one in whom I hope wins multiple awards. Brad Pitt was just goofy, nothing special, but Waltz was downright sinister—a manipulatively charismatic Nazi general who toyed with every character's (including the audience's) emotions. Every time he was present on screen, I felt fully secure in the holy moment, or rather the devilish moment.Similar to the sword picture homage he gave in the Kill Bill series, I.B. reflects Tarantino's obscure reverence towards WWII and the cinema-going experience in general. The film in many instances reveals Tarantino's love of celluloid, as suggested through the multiple Noir, French New Wave, Neo-Realistic and Spaghetti Western nuances. The man has a pervasive education in film history and it greatly heightens the quality of his work—that much I give him. However, as much as the film was provocative and cutting-edge devilry, there was something deeply disturbing about it.The audience, as I'm sure Tarantino intended, was laughing hysterically at all of the blood-spattered carnage displayed implacably before them: whether it was the scalping of Nazi's, the irrevocable and torturous image of Eli Roth bashing a Nazi's head to pieces, or the slitting of throats or machine-gun riddled faces. It was just sick, twisted. Even Tarantino seemed to get the last laugh via his femme fatale laughing head as she watched the theater hall filled with Nazis burn ironically proxy for the Jews. 'Payback is a bitch,' he seemed to subtextually scream.Though I never laughed once, I was just as guilty as they were, for I well knew what I had paid to see. And when you pick up a snake asking it not to bite, you are denying the law of causation; you desire the identities of particular entities to disobey their innate natures and conform instead to your anarchic, destructive wishes. Well, in that sense, the film was a good social experiment. It taught a valuable principle of what it feels like to lose hope and faith in humanity, and as deputy, indulge in the 'super-cool,' pretty packaged pockets of sadism. I was hoping, though, that one of the characters would be redeemed, rather than have to sit through 2 ½ hours of the 'eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth' philosophy.",7,5,12,12 September 2009
The Mummy," I'm not a big fan of Mellow Dramas
","Society seems to be drifting further away from buying into the classical mellow dramatic structure, whether in theater or film. Its structure is too predictable, exaggerated and mundane for an ever increasing and intelligent world that starves for realism, or at least parody. It shouldn't be a surprise, then, why films such as The Dark Knight or Enchanted are coming out and breaking those classical conventions in order to give audiences something newsomething fresh. We're moving away from the classical structure and progressing into the hybrid worlds of both morally ambiguous and farcical mellow dramas.Although The Mummy stayed fairly true to the mellow dramatic structure, there were certain parts that seemed to hint at more farcical interpretations. In other words, it seemed as though the filmmakers were comfortable in making fun of the film itself. For example, when eerie sounds of wind or moans would seep through an open window, Brendan Frasier's character would poke fun at how he expected things like that to happen: 'That seems to happen a lot around here,' he says mockingly. By doing so, he confirms a predictable convention in mellow drama that audiences have been spoon fed for far too long. The result: people laugh and don't take the genre quite too seriously. Another progressive move away from the classical structure comes when Rachel Weisz' character foretells the demise of the unfaithful sidekick, Beni: 'People like you always get their come uping's,' she says, as if to confirm the tragic outcome of all villains in mellow dramas. These two scenes (and I'm sure there were others) depict socially progressive movements away from the cliché elements of mellow drama, and do so by playfully mocking the overall style of the film.Culturally regressive elements in the film deal with how both women and Arabs are portrayed. If memory serves me correct, I believe Rachel Weisz is one of the only female characters in the entire film. She is depicted as being clumsy and inferior; one not on equal playing ground as the men. Her clumsiness is demonstrated in the beginning when she knocks over an entire library of books, and her inferiority is shown when smug comments are thrown her way by certain gold diggers: 'Don't worry; they have a woman on their side. They can't get too far.' She also fits the classical mold of the damsel in distress; one that is helpless by herself and needs a hero to save her. All of these ideas reflect an age unknown to the generation we, today, live in. That is, today women hold much higher statuses and are even, in some cases, more capable than men than displayed in this film. Arabs are portrayed in two lights. In one sense, they are depicted as being traitors to their friends, as shown when Beni betrays Frasier; and in another sense, however, they are shown to be heroes; such as the relationship between Frasier and the Magi, who, at first, seems to be obstacle for Frasier, but later becomes his protecting warrior. The portrayal of Arabs, then, is split down the middle; reflecting them as both socially progressive heroes and culturally regressive traitors.",3,0,2,1 October 2008

500 Days of Summer," Impressive Non-linear Editing
","Opening narration, 'This is a story of boy meets girl. But you should know up front, this is not a love story.' First impression: was the romantic comedy genre being toyed with?—as if what I were about to see was a pseudo, unorthodox love story masked with conventional love story elements? My assumption was right and wrong in two separate contexts. First, the film's non-linear editing style reminded me of the gimmicks of 'Memento'—that is, would the story have been nearly as compelling were it not for its editing? Conversely, play the film in linear motion: would it fall to pieces? Editing has the most powerful effect on the viewer's cinematic experience next to acting. The editing of '500 Days,' though thoroughly engaging, did not, however, make the film.Renoir once said that editing is directing for the second time: it makes or breaks your experience. In the case of both films, I believe 'Memento' would have bombed were it not for Dody Dorn, but '500 Days' would have still soared even with an exempted, non-linear style. The answer: the writing was too smart, even though Neustadter & Weber had to earn my respect. I anticipated something cheap and contrived (like the far too sophisticated, purely obnoxious and childish antics of 'Juno'). I had to be converted, and slowly though, I was.The juxtaposition of scenes strengthened the quality of the film. I loved the truthfulness of the characters: first identifying what he loves about Summer (cut with parts of her body), later slabbed against what he hates about her (again, cut with the same footage). It holds true to the platitude: familiarity breeds contempt. The editing also worked with the split screen 'Reality vs. Expectation' sequence. The differences between both screens were subtle yet terribly sincere, terribly true. I laughed out loud several times. I enjoyed the active participation and socially savvy relationship pedestals the writers invited me to celebrate & mourn.There was also a healthy blend of realism and fantasy as depicted through the expressionistic personification & musically emotive 'after-sex' scene. Walking out of his apartment, everything is fresh and vibrant: smiles all around from on watchers. Suddenly it breaks out into song and dance and we're watching 'Zippity Doo-Dah.' It was fun! There were moments where the dialogue was cliché but the acting and conceptual vocation held by Gordon-Levitt made it worthy of endurance. Come to think of it, Levitt's on-screen career made some of the cliché dialogue wonderfully ironic and that much more compelling.The editing style, again, brought us back & forth through the polar spectrum of emotions: 'She loves me, She loves me not' syndrome. Frankly, Summer was young and happy-go-lucky; not focusing upon dating labels or destinations, but purely enjoying the ride at Levitt's expense—very obnoxious but true. I guess that's a reflection of my willingness to fully commit in relationships rather than play the part with all the benefits without the labels. Overall, the film worked. I won't be surprised if it's up for Academy Awards.",9,1,3,12 September 2009
Children of Heaven," Theme: How is success defined?
","Examining the main theme of this film through the window of another culture showed me that the Iranian ideology is not fundamentally different from our own. In fact, the theme I extracted demonstrated that we share more in common with each other (in terms of the goals we are attempting to achieve as human participants of life) then not: Although adversity and other desperate circumstances seek to thwart man's journey to succeed, man is not only endowed with specific problem-solving capabilities but also the potential to triumph over any obstacle thrown his way.Using the contextual tools in connection with this theme, I seek to examine the following question: How does the hero act in this story? The main character, Ali, is faced with many difficult situations which strongly motivate him to act and provide solutions for. After accidentally losing the shoes of his sister Zahra and realizing the poverty conditions of his family, Ali is challenged with solving how he and his sister are going to get to school with only one pair of shoes. His solution: They can both share a pair of sneakers. Once her day is done, she can rush home and give the sneakers to him. Unfortunately, she arrives too late and causes Ali to be late for his schoolthus creating another problem. Ali develops another solution: His love and care for his sister's welfare causes him to enter a foot race where the runner in third place receives a new pair of sneakers. Although both second and first place prizes are more lucrative, Ali only cares about the happiness of his sister. This was an interesting characteristic of the hero of this culture as contrasted to the hero of an American culture. American heroes are usually determined by how prestigious/strong their image iseven if it be at the expense of another. This particular culture depicted its hero as a weak (small and simple) boy whose primary concern was family. Traditionally speaking from an American perspective, the main character of this film, Ali, would not be considered necessarily a hero. Why? Because he doesn't win what he intended to win in the race. This led me to ask the next question: How is success or failure defined in the story? Success, as defined in the eyes of this culture's hero, is not success unless it benefits the whole rather than the individual. In other words, success is not something to be hoarded to oneself but rather shared equally with others. Ali wants to share his success with his sister by finishing in third place, thereby winning his sister's joy, but instead wins first place. The result of him not enjoying his ranking is terribly ironic when compared to how success is defined in an American cultureif you're not first you're nothing. Rather than benefiting the whole (Ali, his sister and family), Ali reluctantly benefits only himself. As stated in my theme, Ali had the potential to triumph over this particular obstacle but instead received an outcome that ran contrary to what he had desired/intended.Overall, Ali is a unique and culturally diverse hero that demonstrates the tool of activism to help support the lives of his family members. Although he is young and helpless, this does not thwart him from helping and providing solutions to those around him who are also helpless. This idea is demonstrated in two specific scenes: when he helps his helpless father in promoting gardening services in the city, and, when he retrieves the sneakers from a rainstorm outside for his helpless sister who is frightened to retrieve them herself.",7,1,3,15 October 2007
The Prestige," Complexity at its Best
","The Prestige is a highly rich and complex linear narrative that contains many non-conventional elements throughout its storyline. It is compact with multiple themes and motifs that cue the viewer to suspend disbelief, acquire poetic faith, engage in mind-boggling inquiry, and become active participants in determining what is ethical. It is a story that centers upon the darkness of magic. The explicit query, 'Are you watching closely?' provides a profound subtext throughout the film in asking the following: What is real and what is illusion? Examining the nature of self-sacrifice and to what extent its meaning is skewed is another common question asked. It effectively manipulates the viewer's emotions in providing no real protagonist but rather invites them to carefully consider there own heroism. What is meant by this is that the viewer is given a choice after seeing what dire consequences fall upon the lead antagonists of the piece. The choice is the following: Either you walk away feeling bitter about the unethical values these two characters held, or, you obtain a heroic and metaphorical textbook on how not to act when offenses come into your life. This is the predominant theme of the film: Although offenses will come, suspend what you consider unethical in other's views by allowing tolerance to teach you a lesson on how not to react when feelings are injured. In following the traditional aristocratic method of storytelling, The Prestige examines the lives of two skilled magicians whose hearts lack forgiveness and whose obsessions with becoming the 'greatest magicians of all time' thwart their opportunities to be happy. In an ongoing battle of jealousy, envy and meticulous revenge, the two men become slaves to their illusions and end up sacrificing what's most important to themtheir lives; their families. The editing of this film is rather non-conventional and illusory. In support of the subject of magic, it eludes both time and space to create an off-set, spatial and temporal ambiguity. The viewer is constantly thrust between past, present and future settings through the use of journals being read, stories being told, and first-person narrations of both antagonists. The effect of this parallel editing is used to keep the viewer on his/her feet in determining what is real and what is not. Director Christopher Nolan made some rather poignant directing choices during the process of analyzing, interpreting and conceptualizing the piece. One particular choice is of choosing the concept of magic to examine the many avenues (both metaphysical and transcendental) of deceit amongst the characters. One such avenue is of deceiving the viewer on what type of genre the film is. Upon entering the theater, the viewer most likely suspends disbelief to the psychological thriller or drama genre, little knowing that half-way through the film it will become a science-fiction piece. The reason this works and why the viewer ought not to feel disappointment by its 'unrealistic' qualities is that the film itself is based upon the idea of magic being a form of enchantment and illusion. Nolan is able to get away with switching the genre for this very reason. However, this is the only reason. If the film were to contemplate any other theme than magic, it most likely would not work. It's as if Nolan is performing his own prestige over the viewer's assumptions and parading their expectations with suspense and surprise. Like the characters in his film, Nolan too has sacrificed much in making this film. Any film as complexly deep and rich as this one is had to have been extremely well thought out and prepared for. The choice of setting the story in the early 1900's reflects the beginning of the post-modernist and film phenomenological eraone which has no fixed meaning other than what the viewer brings to it. It's completely fitting for a story as ambivalent and open-ended as this one is where meaning can literally be derived from anywhere.",10,3,5,4 December 2007
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Standing for Something
","The Passion of Joan of Arc is a deeply moving story about the last vindictive trial of Joan's life before her martyrdom at the stake. Joan's story is uncannily similar to the story of Christboth were viewed as extremists; both were thought to be a threat to political power; both were told to deny their beliefs by a group of tyrannical clergymen; and both were ultimately murdered for their convictions. Joan, like Christ, becomes more and more at a loss of words as she is vehemently interrogated, knowing full well that her words are futile and that death awaits her. Her silence, in many instances, parallels the silence of Christ and is perhaps the most powerful testimony she gives against the brooding Englishmen who enslaved her.Her story is also strangely similar to Joseph Smithfor why else would such a seemingly insignificant character as nineteen-year old girl, Joan, attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling? Some would argue that it was due to Joan's military status in the French army, and though indeed that might be partly true, I don't believe it's the full truth. There must have been something more in Joan's testimony that caused such 'great ones' to behold her as a threat to the entire English government. I mean, why would a mere denial of her 'vision of God' be enough to satiate these blood-thirsty hypocrites? There must have been something else driving their motives. Nevertheless, I find it very peculiar that she was greatly feared amongst such 'powerful men.' Extreme close-ups are used quite abundantly throughout the entirety of the film to help show the exhaustion of Joan. I believe this technique was used to capture how violated she must have felt: nothing but angry faces ranting and railing up-close against her, as if Dreyer was purposely trying to attack the audience so that they could live vicariously through her torment. One close-up after the next, we see the deterioration of Joan as her life is fed to entropythe audience feels equally as deteriorated by the end too. I think the use of close-ups was incredibly powerful. They allowed for a type of transcendence to occur. This transcendence takes the form of seeing the life in Joan's face fade more and more; concurrently the audience prays for her spirit to transcend the pangs of her body and be freed from the hell she experiences on earth.The film, in this sense, has a very transcendental quality. Though the audience may never have to experience a martyrdom like Joan or Christ, they will feel the desire to want to be freed from their own physical bondage, pain and suffering. The film is silent, and as such, creates a sparse-style of transcendencesomething that speaks softly to the soul, unlike DeMille's abundant-style in The Ten Commandments. It offers a lot of room for reflection as we sit there beholding these intense images in holy silence.Having mentioned transcendence, I believe the film has much to say about the relationship between salvation and man. As Joan is being savagely questioned about her 'vision of God,' the clergy keep reminding her that her sins can be forgiven in and through the Church. Never once do they mention that salvation comes through Christ, let alone Godit's always through the authority of the Church. I think Dreyer is merely trying to remind the viewer what history books have already enlightened the world with: that there is something strange about salvation coming from a 'learned' group of men who appear pious and holy devout to the Divine, but who lack inner-conviction and act as wolves dressed in sheep's clothing. 'By their fruits ye shall know them,' seems to be the underlying theme to this film. These men do not emit the qualities of goodnessthey are depicted as fearful and angry; they stop at nothing to force Joan to confess a false testimony. They are like the Pharisees of old who attacked and stoned the prophets all to maintain and secure the appearance of godliness. Their fruits, however, reveal who they really are: tyrants of a brute nature.One quality I really respected and identified in Joan was her humanity. She wasn't depicted as some sinless warrior, let alone saint who was constantly in God's good standing, but at one moment succumbed to the frailty of her mortal condition and fell before God to preserve her life. In this moment, she renounced her vision in order to acquiesce to the Englishmen's desires. It was contrived though, and she knew it. Feeling the pangs of a guilty conscience, she immediately called back the guards and repented of her sin. I loved seeing this character arc in her because it made her even more real; more relatable; more human. This sequence demonstrated the power of repentance, and how even the noblest of God's children are not immune to the temptations of the body. All must immerse their lives in the principle of repentance (i.e. change from man's will to God's will). Though God's will is often very personal and nebulous, it is not to be determined by the will of 'learned, erudite scholars,' but from careful adherence to what one considers is the right path.",7,2,6,8 March 2009
The Orphanage," A Ghost Story for Peter Pan
","I really liked how writer Sergio G. Sanchez took the tale of Peter Pan and loosely adapted it around a ghost story about lost children. The way he paralleled the story of Pan to his own wasn't overt, but subtleas if it merely augmented a richer meaning behind the story of the lost boys. In the case of The Orphanage, the story is about lost childrenboth boys and girls. In one aspect, the story's subtext is about piratesthose who search for buried treasure. Sanchez provides a series of clues (i.e. images/scenes) for the audience themselves to become pirates as they, too, piece together these cluesone by onein order to obtain the treasure of the overall story: its meaning. In other words, there is no seemingly pointless images/scenes/dialogue in this film. Everything is used as a clue to help the audience embark on a pirate's quest for buried treasure. For example, the scene where Simon and Laura go on a treasure hunt to find Simon's coins sets up the story parallel between Peter Pan and the story that grew from itThe Orphanage. Simon tells his mother that his imaginary friends (e.g. the lost children) stole his coins and hid them. If he is successful in following the clues and retaining his coins, his friends will grant him a wish. She doesn't believe him but humors him anyway. It's interesting that Laura only begins to believe in her son's imaginary friends when something she holds precious (i.e. her son) is taken from her. It reminded me of how easy it is to lose the gift of believing when you become an adult. Adults typically have the tendency to treat most things with weary, skeptical eyes. The challenge, then, is for adults to reclaim that sacred treasure of believing. Sadly, however, they usually have to be threatened with death before they start believing. In Laura's case, she must be threatened with the possibility that her son is dead before she starts a serious investigation to find her sonto find the qualities she used to possess as a child. Another example that helps the viewer become a pirate looking for treasure is when the orphans play the game of '1, 2, 3, knock on the wall.' It seems like a somewhat arbitrary game to play, but it actually helps provide a clue that foreshadows a later scene when Laura attempts to summon the orphans back from the dead. She needs to talk to the orphans that haunt her house because she feels they can help lead her to her son. The trick, though, is that in order for her to get what she wants, she has to help the orphans get what they wantand what they want is a mother to care for them. Laura is like Wendy of Peter Pan; a girl who left the Neverland orphanage when she was young, grew up, lost her child-like imagination and stopped believing in fantasies. When she left the orphanage, she left her friendsshe died (e.g. separated) from them. It's as if her friends are now haunting her because they're asking her to awaken herselfstart believing againbut most importantly, to be a mother to themlike Wendy of the lost boys. The only way they are able to make their plight strong enough for Laura to understand is by placing what she values most in jeopardy. Only then will she be prepared to accept the responsibility of caring for the lost children, because she would then know what it's like to lose a child. The lost children have lost a motherhave lost a person to care for them. It's really quite a profound story when you think about it. It is the story of a person losing something as valuable as buried treasure; then going on a journey to reclaim that treasure by following clues along the way; gaining a deep sense of empathy in the process; finding that treasure in the end, and finally, taking on the role of Sheppardcaring for those around you who are currently lost and looking for treasure. Though the specifics of what we treasure may differ from person to person, I think it's safe to say that we all have taken this journey, and are yet currently in the process of searching for what we value most. Because of these things, The Orphanage is a story that is universally applicable to all.",8,1,3,1 February 2009
Edward Scissorhands," Absurdity vs Normality
","Edward Scissorhands is a deeply peculiar and philosophical story that questions the peculiarity of life. It is a story that challenges people's ideas as to what is considered strange versus what is considered normal, and how by calling something strange or normal is really just a prejudice that identifies itself with the other side. In other words, what one person calls normal is what another may call strange. People typically use the word 'strange' to alienate themselves from that which they don't understand, or are afraid of. The truth of the matter is that everything and everyone is strange; which is to say, everyone and everything is not completely understood, each of us being quintessentially unique. We have to familiarize ourselves with the strange and welcome it with open arms in order to understand ourselves, others and life in general better. The story of Edward Scissorhands is no different.Edward is a part machine part man whose creator dies before his completion, leaving him with scissors for hands. He lives life as a social outcast within the vacant walls of a lonely, deserted castle, and is one day invited to live a 'normal' lifestyle amongst a neighborhood of gossipy Suburban folk. He timidly accepts the offer, descends from his gloomy abode and enters a world that is not entirely familiar to him. He gawks inquisitively out car windows, jolts when telephones ring, pokes the mirror to examine the reflection he sees, struggles to eat food like everyone else, and overall lives in this new world like a foreign yet wondrous traveler. As the Avon lady who gave him this invitation concludes, 'It'll take some time to getting used to Edward before you start feeling at home.' Profound are these words. They seem to strike at the very core of the pilgrim within us all; traveling like foreigners on an unfamiliar planet as we try and familiarize ourselves and search for the cure to our divine homesickness.That which we typically familiarize ourselves with to a great degree we call 'home', or comfort. Conveniently for us we have quickly grown accustom to our home since birth. Earth is our home, and it is a place that has become familiar to us through repetition and time. For an individual like Edward, howeverone whom many of us would view as alien because of his differenceshe, to the contrary views our home as alien, and if you really stop to think about it, he's right.The film's objective correlative seems to argue that it's OK to view life as absurd. Life is absurd. Life's absurdity will hopefully motivate us to learn more about what we are a part of, and to make that which was once considered absurd seem more reasonable. This only happens by descending, like Edward, from our homes of comfort and discovering the beauty that lies within the unknown. I believe we all bask in our own private wonderlands that at times make sense, and other times make nonsense. We're all still so naïve about who we are, where we came from, why we're here and where we're going, that to call something strange, I think, would be an indirect compliment to the God who created us all. It just means that we haven't explored enough. With time and repetition, however, things will become more familiar until we reach the status of feeling like we've finally arrivedfinally made it home.Edward Scissorhands is truly a wonderful story that reminds all of us not to lose our child-like ingenuities, but to embrace fear with loving hands and a confident smile.",10,1,2,19 November 2008
District 9," Poignant Themes, Values, & Aesthetics
","What critics are calling a 'scathing social satire' in conjunction with what I will call a culturally well-informed platform, District 9 is an extremely intelligent vision that no doubt will spawn many intelligent conversations. The film surprisingly comes to us from first time director, Neill Blomkamp, who, despite his limited short-film repertoire, will most likely attract many eyes in future years.Blomkamp gracefully employs a very raw, very visceral, docudrama style not much unlike the dust bowl feel of cinéma vérité. He takes it, however, several steps further by combining photorealistic CGI to gain the film's expressionistic quality, with shaky, hand-held documentary edges to expose more of its naturalistic elements. In this way, the film is uplifted with a highly chimerical imagination while simultaneously grounded in the grime of worldliness. Poetically speaking, it is both real and fake at the same time, or, as McKee puts it, it's a 'fantasy-reality hybrid' of a film, which, in my view, makes the best of films. Also, as an added benefit, the form (though definitely not content) of the film was reminiscent of Tom Tykwer's Lola Rennt for those who deem themselves internationally savvy.There's lots to consider in this one: xenophobic attitudes, government consolidation, immigration laws, unabridged intolerance, atoning foreign cultures and ideas, reconciling 'separate but equal' amendments, scapegoating the many faces of otherness, the physics of entropy, war inebriation, evolutionary mutations, media manipulation, and the role reversals of friends and enemies to name a few. Though the film is not strictly immersed in philosophical thought—indeed, much of the action-packed sequences resemble an astronomically greater version of Transformers meets Starship Troopers—I will focus on a few of the film's subtextual philosophies that I found particularly timely.Blomkamp plays the role of what I will call the 'revelatory manipulator' quite flawlessly. He cleverly crafts the revelation—the drawing back of the curtain so to speak—of information to the audience that forces them into an ironic, self-reflective state of mind. For instance, the film opens with viewers most likely on the side of the humans as they infiltrate the negatively perceived, alien project homes. No doubt to this media spun projection, viewers will identify with their own kind: humans as the good guys, aliens as the bad guys. If we aren't careful though, we fall easily into this trap and are later reminded of the danger of segregated, binary thinking.Using the ancient Greek logos and pathos storytelling devices, Blomkamp works on the audiences sensitivities by evoking sympathy for the aliens, much of which I believe worked. The tables turn and it is the human participants—those watching the film—who slowly begin to side with the alien paradigm, despising now their own kind. Another way of saying this is that those who watch the film are confronted with their own ugliness and self-destructive behaviors. To grasp this, however, we must sacrifice our need to be right simply because we're human, focus on being kind, and look beyond the sci-fi alien spectacle. Ironically, we're just as much alien as is the flower to the rock (intelligence not included of course).The use of the concept 'alien,' not as some Ridley Scott, galactic creature, but as that which is foreign, weird, strange or scary, pervades the story, allowing us to ponder upon our own aliens in the attic. Blomkamp exposes our human frailties in such a remarkable way, essentially showing us that we don't have to build walls of separation, let alone fear the strange, if only we would seek understanding via candid communication and welcome that which is alien with loving, forgiving hands. Much of the film is riddled with politically charged atoms and secret mysteries of the human condition, and I believe it will best serve the public by being thoroughly talked about immediately after watching.Spread the word.",9,14,24,12 September 2009
The Lives of Others," Film-making at its Best
","Filmmaker's Purpose.This film expresses an array of complex characters and concepts, all which are historically intertwined and provocatively motivated by the belief in rebellion. It is the rebellion of those possessing a considerable measure of moral courage that fight against the corruptions of East Germany's secret police in order to establish freedom from tyranny. However, resistance is felt amongst both partiesthose who seek to collapse the socialist movement in East Berlin, and those who seek to maintain the socialist status quo. Each character in the film has something to rebel against. Their rebellion springs forth from a desire to foster progressive attitudes in an ever paranoid community.Anti-socialist/writer, Georg Dreyman, rebels against the Stasi by publishing a series of suicide rates in the Spiegel report (West Germany). His purpose in doing so is to expose the consequences of what happens when a corrupted government unethically infiltrates the lives of others. Those whose lives are penetrated by the police are driven to madness and eventually suicide. Dreyman's hopes are that the reports will produce a disdainful image on the Stasi and thereby lead to their downfall as well as of the socialist state.Interrogation agent Wiesler has an internal rebellion throughout the film. His feelings are torn between his loyalty to the state versus his loyalty to his conscience. On one hand, his moral obligation to the state consists of him secretly investigating the lives of anyone suspected of revolutionary ideas. It is his solemn duty to uphold the socialist status quo. On the other hand, however, he feels his life-long service to the state has turned him into some type of hidden monsterone that fears exposure and secretly lurks in the corners of paranoia. His rebellion to become innocent again takes him on a cathartic journey through which he slowly begins to throw off the shackles of conditioned imprisonment that the state has created in his mind.Actress CMS, Dreyman's girlfriend, is confronted by a series of challenges that lead her to rebel both against her conscience as well as the powers that be. Her life is governed by her art. The art she creates for herself is acting. However, a façade is created in her mind by Minister Hempf that there are limits to her creative powers in how far she can climb in the business. Due to the Minister's high position in government affairs, he threatens her to believe that unless she gives her body to satiate his lusting desires, she will be blacklisted and unable to fulfill her dreams. At first, she rebels against her conscience as well as those who truly love her namely Dreymanand fulfills the wishes of the Minister. Later, after being verbally saved in a bar by agent Wiesler, she comes to her senses and decides that her talent is independently greater than the shallow intimidations of the Minster.One aesthetical element that contributes to the filmmaker's purpose of rebellion is the directingin particular, the director's choice of choosing the title of the film. Deep implications are found behind thinking about what the lives of others means. The mere observation that the lives of others are being infiltrated and exposed in this community is representative of the paranoia that was still existent during the post-Cold War years. The prevailing and corrupt government was married to this paranoia in consequence of their potential thoughts of losing power over the state. As philosopher Thomas Hobbes once professed, 'Human nature is innately predicated upon self-interest and desires for power.' It was this desire for power that led those in control to rebel against the people in order to maintain the governing status quo.Symptomatically speaking, humans have always needed something to rebel against in order for them to feel progressively challenged. We, by nature, are problem solvers. If there is not intense opposition attempting to thwart our goals, the definition and feeling of success is eradicated; for success is predicated upon overcoming that which provides severe pressure. As paraphrased in one of the last scenes of the film, the Minister declares to Dreyman after the wall comes down that 'if there's nothing to believe in or rebel against, the people don't grow.' It is through the challenges we face in life that propels us to rebel against the current state, whether literally or figuratively speaking, and through the process become new and refined creatures.",10,0,0,2 March 2008
The Elephant Man," Taking Merrick in Complete Context
","One of the predominant themes the director portrays in this film is in teaching the viewer not to be an 'offender for a word.' Given the loglinea permanently disfigured man is freed from the debasing life of freak-show entertaining and is given an opportunity to feel and be treated as a human beingthe viewer is taught not to cast unrighteous judgment onto another by not taking offensive of their outward appearance (Merrick's disfigurement). Instead, they are generously taught to embrace the inward appearance of people, in this case the spirit of John Merrick, and to treat him with just as much respect as a 'normal' person would be treated. In short, it is a film that hones in on the importance of observing internal rather than external beauty.Director David Lynch sets a specific standard by asking the viewer to consider an important idea: Learn to analyze a human life in complete context of who they are before casting judgment. How could this be done? The subtext of the film asks the viewer to seek to understand what they do not understand by asking questions. This means that the viewer should not make poor assumptions of a person based upon their physical appearance, how they might talk, or even how they might dress. A person who superficially judges another based upon these factors conforms to a readerly contextone who judges without analyzing. Contrariwise, Lynch is asking the viewer to be writerlyin other words, choose to see the good in John Merrick, and humanity for that matter, by analyzing and asking questions to the things (i.e. people, films, ideologies) you don't understand.A general standard I've adopted while watching and critiquing films conforms to Lynch's overall message in this particular film. Just as Lynch suggests that the unexamined life is not worth living, I conclude that the unexamined film is not worth watching. The Elephant Man is a film about choosing not to be offended. My reasons are as follows.The characters in the film who are offended by Merrick's appearance (i.e. crowds at freak-show, Merrick's owner, nurses, doctor's in training, watch-guard) are the one's who take him out of context of who he really isand who is he really? From the viewer's perspective, Merrick is kind, thoughtful, romantic, intelligent, emotional and sensitive. He is a human beingnot an animal. However, these aspects of his character are ignored by the offended because they refuse to take him in contextin other words, they refuse to see beyond his physical appearance. They do not allow him to express himself. As a result of this rejection, Merrick is confined to a life of fear, misery, disparagement and loneliness.The viewer, on the other hand, is given the opportunity to see Merrick for everything he is in context. There are several ways the director accomplishes this: First, the viewer is divorced from the animalistic qualities that are unfortunately attributed to Merrick and as a result learn to care deeply for him. How is this done? The director shows the viewer truthful and poignant moments of Merrick's humanity: his love for theater and poetry shows his interests in the arts; his graciousness in accepting gifts from both the doctor (Anthony Hopkins) and the theater actress (Anne Bancroft) shows his cordiality; his ability to recite scripture illustrates his intelligence; and his ability to converse with other human beings demonstrates his cognitive understanding. He is just as real as anybody else.The only character in the film who chooses to see beyond Merrick's surface is Anthony Hopkins. The most powerful moment in the film that best defines the theme I've suggested is when Hopkins first sees Merrick in his prison cell. Rather than repelling with horror like everyone else, Hopkins completely embraces the sight of Merrick. While doing so, the camera slowly dolly's towards his face, capturing a single tear falling from his eye and down his cheek. It is beautiful! In that one moment alone, the entire theme is summarized: Don't be offended by the outward appearance of what you think is evil; rather, learn to embrace what you don't understand by welcoming fear with loving hands.",8,0,0,12 October 2007
Hero," Tragic Hero Excellence
","In Hero, Nameless is portrayed as an exceptional assassin whose talents for martial arts and guile exceed that of his friends and enemies. His stealth allows him to always be one step ahead of them. By orchestrating an extraordinary plan to restore peace and unity between the people of Qin and Zhao, Nameless fabricates multiple stories of his having killed the greatest assassins in the land; all for the objective of getting nearer towards the king of Qin. By moving nearer towards the king in his own palace, Nameless comes closer to killing the kingan objective which, if fulfilled, will seemingly abolish tyranny and restore unity in China.However, I will not endorse Nameless' tragic flaw as being that he did not succeed in killing the kingthat would be too obvious. In fact, I do not believe it was ever Nameless' intention to kill the king; he is too intelligent to not know that violence does not solve violence. Although it may have appeared that this was his objective, I argue that he only had to make the king think that he was going to kill him. By doing so, Nameless then creates the façade of having those around him think that he is dangerous. Since anything that appears dangerous before the king must be eliminated, Nameless must be eliminated.Nameless thus becomes the sacrificial lamb of the filmthe tragic hero. He knew what he was doing when he first entered the palace; he was the author and finisher of his fate by sealing it with his own blood. No one could take his life from him other than his freely giving up his life for the cause of establishing unity in the land. However, he knew he had to be made an example for everyone else who attempted to defy the king. If Nameless could not succeed in overthrowing the king, no one could. I mean, should we really think that he couldn't have killed the king if he wanted to? Furthermore, should we really think that his death by arrows couldn't have been prevented by all of his cool flying and dodging tricks? I doubt so. Nameless did not change his initial objective: to help the king realize that he had to kill the greatest assassin in the land, namely Nameless. He succeeded in developing this realization inside the king. Thus, the only tragic flaw in Nameless is that he dies before witnessing the reformation of the peace and unity which subsequently followed his death. His fate is sealed in his death because he inevitably followed through with his plan independent of anyone intelligent enough to thwart him. It was a brilliant finish to his well laudable and pitied feat. I say 'pity' because his actions were truly heroic and yet we have no way to thank him for his courage and loyalty to the land.Nature is beautifully captured in this film to help support the internal/external theme of the struggling characters: only when the inner vessel is in harmony will the outer vessel (nature) be too in harmony. In other words, the inner struggle between the characters who want the king dead versus those who don't is a reflection of the outer and current state of their society as a wholea divided mess. Zhang Yimou helps emphasize this internal and external struggle by using immaculate colors to dress the scenes. Each color gives a certain emotion that we are to feel towards how each character is changing. Just as each character wants to reconcile differences and restore peace, the land (nature) also wants reconciliation. The land is like a metaphor for what is taking place inside the characters. If the land is unified, the people are unified and vice versa. This is the reason why there is so much imagery of nature in the film; it's as if Yimou is trying to say that the land and the people are one in the same, both trying to establish peace and unity.",10,0,0,20 September 2008
The Hurt Locker," Best Film of '09
","Despite the fact that I'm not a strong advocate of war films, let alone action films, I'd be lying if I didn't say this is the best film I've seen so far this year (and I highly doubt anything will compare to it). I went in with high hopes after reviewing the many critic/user accolades, absorbed the meaning of the opening statement presented as a fact—'War is a drug'—and came out feeling inebriated on the entire cinematic experience. Not only was the journey of watching the film terribly engaging, the aftermath reflection was equally as cathartic and tantalizing. It's as close as you can get to a near-perfect film: emotionally-driven, patriotic, contemplative, free from overt bias, adrenaline-based, strong acting, stronger characters, provocative theme, extremely well-paced, edgy and exhilarating. I strongly recommend it!",10,32,50,12 September 2009
La Grande Illusion," A Gentlemen's War
","Renoir uses the element of directing to expose the predominant theme of this film: friendships are what sustain human life. Rather than choosing to focus on the suffering and angst of war, Renoir hones in on the humane aspects of brotherly love and kindness to display this message. This is revealed from the very beginning. When French pilots are captured behind enemy lines by the Germans, they are taken to prison amongst other nationalities where all are treated with respect. It seems more like a gentlemen's war in this regard. Renoir establishes this veneration by showing the veteran prisoners warning the newcomers of material confiscation. They do this by playfully singing a song about 'hiding your valuables.' Renoir further directs the viewer's attention to the theme of friendship by showing that although the prisoners come from different backgrounds (i.e. occupations, interests, nationalities) they still can gather together in a welcoming environment to eat a home-cooked meal. They also help one another support the cause of escape by digging a tunnel under the barracks. Even under the direction of choosing the title of the film, Renoir ironically suggests that the grand illusion of war is war itself. War is what creates a violent façade over what matters mosthuman relationships.Again this theme presents itself when the main character, Marechal (a Frenchmen), attempts to give information to an incoming caught Englishmen regarding an escaping tunnel in one of the barracks. Even though there is a language barrier and neither one of them understand each other, the attempt was made and further contributes to the spirit of unification and friendship. Through Renoir's sense of direction, he deliberately eliminates any prejudice between race and military status and in turn establishes a wonderful connection between all of the characters.The most powerful moment in the film that completely seals the theme is when Renoir romantically brings Marechal and a German widow together in a Romeo & Juliet type manner. Despite their countries fighting in a war with each other, they see beyond the hatred and find love. It is this love that clinches the highest form of friendship.",9,3,3,12 December 2007
The Fountain," I've seen Better Aronofsky Films
","I feel rather ambivalent towards The Fountain. The structure is somewhat cold and melancholy, yet there are also subtle moments of inspiration and hope. The story seems to mourn over the loss of spirituality in today's culture and tries to resurrect hope in the existence of man as an eternal race. However, I didn't feel compelled to lead a more spiritual life after watching it. This is not to suggest that the film lacked spiritual undertones; indeed, the film had many. I only felt that it could have been portrayed more powerfully if it didn't really so much upon the surreal and abstract. Granted, I understand that expressionistic films often rely heavily upon both. It just for some reason didn't leave me feeling satisfied. In short, it's not my favorite Aronofsky piece but I appreciated his efforts to search for spirituality in a seemingly lost and hopeless world. I think the film tries to emphasize that death is not something that people should fear. Hope ought to override death; hope for a better tomorrow and better existence in general. Death is what eats away at this hope in most people's lives. The film at first depicts death as inevitable, and since no one escapes its jaws, life should be held as something extremely preciousas if to imply that there may not be an afterlife. To live with the belief that life does not perpetuate beyond the grave is a terrible reality for most people to embrace, including Jackman's character. He, like most of us, fears death because of the attachments he has made on earth. In particular, he develops a special bond with his significant other. The mere thought of losing her to the unknown brings only pain because his soul longs to be with her forever. In this sense, the film does a good job at promoting the human hope to live for the people we love and for a better world, rather than selfishly squander it to ourselves. Jackman's character helps display the struggle that most of us have between wanting to save our loved ones from death, versus spending time with those who inevitably will die.Jackman plays an obsessive doctor/conquistador who sees death as a curable disease. He stops at nothing to find this cure so he can save the life of his dying wife. Though his cause is stalwart and even noble, he becomes too preoccupied with his work and loses the meaning of his lifehis wife. By sacrificing his life to search for eternal life, he neglects his wife to a degree and fails to save her before she dies. Consequently, his soul becomes harrowed up as he replays a regretful memory in his mind of ignoring her when she asks him to go on a walk. For Jackman, a hope for reconciliation with his wife in some posthumous world seems bleak. The overarching story juxtaposes three distinct time periods in which Jackman is on a mission to find the cure for death. The only time period sketch that suggested the transcendence of earth and into the sublime was the one where Jackman is floating within the tree of life bubble. As he tries to save the tree from dying completely, he continues to float heavenward until he reaches the ultimate enlightenment. Though I think I understood what Aronofsky was trying to do, I wish he would have executed the film without heavily relying upon the abstract. Then again, who am I to criticize a personalized vision of eternity that was born out of one of the more talented filmmakers in our society?",5,1,4,9 November 2008
The Wrestler," Naturalism A at its Finest
","The Best Film I've seen all year (10/10)! Mickey Rourke drove me to tears. The story follows the life of a pathetic, downtrodden, aging wrestler who tries to make amends with the broken relationships that surround him.It's naturalism A at its finestreally shows the dirt and destitute living conditions that some fall victim to. However, that dirt and destitution is not without cleansing, hope, repentance, forgiveness, and optimism.It's predominantly observatory, as if the camera acts like a fly on the wall for audiences to merely taste the life of this very 'real' person. Overall, the film basks in a supernal light because it paints ugly people in beautiful colors. It gives a voice to the voiceless and shatters the stereotypes of wrestlers, strippers, drug abusers and bastard children. Truly humbling! Aaronofsky continues to amaze me with his dynamic film-making style. It's very unlike anything he's done before (independent of the gritty and raw edges he provides for his characters though). This might be his best film yet.",10,2,4,28 December 2008
The Iron Giant," Hogarth as Protagonist
","In The Iron Giant, I would argue that Hogarth is the protagonist of the film. Simply put, his enacted choices are what drive the plot and develop the overarching themehence the film's dictum, 'Your choices make who you are.' He is introduced to the viewer as an adventurous young boy who relishes at the chance of having a close friendship, even while at the cost of driving his hardworking mother bonkers (like when he chooses to befriend a squirrel).His main objective is to satisfy his need for friendship. The inciting incident that leads him on this journey is when his television short circuits and interrupts his horror film. Committed to find the fiend who stole, or should we say, ate his antenna wire, Hogarth plunges into the forest and discovers the iron giant. When he makes the conscious choice to save the robots life after seeing him entangled in a web of electrical power lines, it is here, whether he realizes it or not, that his once balanced life becomes unbalanced. After all, to befriend the giant is to introduce a heavy weight, both physically and metaphorically, into his life; thus tipping the balancing scale. Hogarth, however, is up for the challenge. His thirst for friendship surpasses the weight of any obstacle that might thwart this desire of his. Soon the giant begins to follow him where ever he goes. Hogarth is now faced with an enormous obstacleto hide the giant while protecting him from a paranoid government detective. One obstacle after the next, a special bond is created between Hogarth and the giant; one that truly exemplifies the meaning of the word 'friendship.' With Hogarth's continual choice to befriend the giant, the plot is further developed and the audience learns that the giant is much like Hogarth himselfone who has a soul that feels and thinks. This significant plot point may have never been revealed unless there was a character like Hogarth who extended an unprejudiced love towards the gianta love that seemed to lack in the rest of the city because of their fear of 'otherness.' The audience also learns that the giant is a volitional being who can choose whether to be good like superman, or bad like Atomo. This is revealed, once again, because of Hogarth. With Hogarth's help, the giant learns not to act like a weapon of destruction, but rather as a friend to mankind. This idea is particularly emphasized at the crisis/climax of the film. As Hogarth had originally sacrificed the safety of his life when saving the giant, the giant now returns the favor at the end of the film by sacrificing his life to save both Hogarth and the rest of the city. This you could say is the film's meatball criticism: one who lays down his life for the life of his friend is truly a friend indeed. True friendship is found in sacrifice, not selfishness, be it ever great or small. Is Hogarth's objective obtained? I would say yes, for it is the robot's memory that will forever live in his mind as the best friend he ever had.",8,0,1,20 September 2008
Amélie," Simply Charming!
","Amelie is a highly imaginative and charming young lady who retains her child-like ingenuities and uses them to serve and discipline mankind. Her world is full of vibrant colors, destined chances, risky safe zones, and seemingly altruistic values. Due to a lack of parental love when she was a child (which otherwise would have boosted her self-worth and joy), Amelie resorts to her imagination to escape from the harsh realities that surround her (i.e. her mother dying in a suicidal freak accident; her airy father being completely oblivious to her needs). Reality often disappoints whereas her imagination does not. From taking pictures of cloudy teddy bears in the sky, to watching people's reactions in a movie theater, Amelie's imagination carries her into adulthood to find what she most desires: love.Upon coincidentally discovering a memory box of the previous owner of her apartment, Amelie embarks on a destined journey to find the owner and return it to him. When she realizes the wonderful impact of finding and returning the box to its owner, a humble man by the name of Bretodeau, her heart excites and takes confidence in her new found discoverythat is, sharing love with others enriches your self-worth and restores your joy (two things Amelie lacked from her childhood). As this surge of love illuminates her body, she becomes aware of how simple and clear life is. She's now discovered her life's missionto serve mankind! Her philosophy, however, is not entirely altruistic. She has great need of people reciprocating to her alms in secret, thereby always receiving an instant rewardwhether watching their reactions from afar (i.e. spying on Bretodeau's discovery in the phone booth), or, simply listening to the accolades they have for her (i.e. Bretodeau talking to the bartender in her presence about 'paying the kindness forward' and visiting his grandson). Every kindness she gives is, in part, a kindness to herself. In this manner, she is simply learning the positive effects of karma and acquiring the love she longed for as a child.Although she feels the essence of love for every kind deed she gives, there is still something missing. She has not yet felt the euphoric effects of being in love with a person. The challenge to find and keep her lover will determine her ability to enter a rebirth. She has always been satiated in doing alms in secret, but will eventually have to find a reborn confidence of facing those in whom she loves on a personal level. When seemingly stumbling upon the man she has feelings for, Nino Quincampoix, a man who, like herself, finds pleasure in helping others, she loses her confidence to act face to face and begins to speak the only language of love she knows: secret gift-giving. She slowly begins overcoming her fear of love by taking healthy risks in order to acquire her desire. A specific metaphysical sequence that helps demonstrate how she overcomes this fear is when she rides the carnival ride from hell; Nino's work environment. Hell is often associated with feelings of fear, anxiety, or any other emotional vices labeled as causing pain or discomfort. The idea that Amelie is stepping out of her comfort zonea ride from hellknowing full well the risk she is taking of potentially being rejected, demonstrates her willingness to suspend her fear and embrace a resilient sense of moral courage.Another moment that helps her gather the courage to overcome her fear of rejection is when the artist known as 'the glass man', sends her a video tape commanding her not to let him pass, lest her heart later in life becomes as brittle as his bones. By the end of the film, she has taken enough chances and learned from her mistakes of not allowing fear to dominate her choices (i.e. denying who she was to Nino at the restaurant). Consequently, she is found nestled in the warmth of Nino's arms.Filmmaker's Purpose.Jeunet's purpose in making this film is to convey the following message: Every person wants to leave their mark upon the world and be remembered in the highest possible esteem. For most this is achieved by bringing forth good and honorable works so that others might see those works and emulate the same. It is a message of understanding the positive repercussions of karma and how continuing to perpetuate good will unto mankind leads to ultimate happiness.Certain aesthetical elements help support this theme. The diegetic music played from a record player in the subway station during Amelie's first encounter with the blind man sings as follows: 'How could I live; never to know the joy that you give; when I'm in your arms; I'm under your charms.' The fact that the blind man is holding the record player is symbolic of a prayer he is giving to the world. The lyrics help foreshadow the joys and charms that Amelie will yet present to the blind man prayer when later helping him cross the street, describing in immaculate detail the vibrant scenery he has never experienced.A specific camera movement and supplementary special effect is also used during the blind man sequence in the street. After helping him along the way and describing to him the delicate scene, Amelie leaves the man to ponder for himself what just took place. The camera is on a crane and is looking down upon the man as he looks heavenward. It's as if he's looking to God, expressing his thanks for the kindness just granted to him. To make the moment even more surreal, a special effect is used to highlight the man's surrounding in a brilliant fire-like glow. He has certainly been touched by the love of mankind, or better stated, the love of God. The viewer is left to assume that the man's life was affected for the better, restoring his confidence in mankind and perpetuating his own good will onto others.",10,2,6,14 January 2008
