Come and See," The Emperors new clothes
","I'm going to really stand out from the crowd on this but I thought it was dreadful. Poor acting, poor direction, desperately slow, lacking content and with a childlike obsession with re-using the same image over and over again. I'm sure the plane in the sky is meant to be symbolic. To me it just showed the director only had the budget to buy one piece of archive footage.I'm a lover of slow paced films so I am by no means a modern impatient film watcher. And I love films, but really films are supposed to be entertaining. Or shocking. Or thought provoking. This is so tedious it feels like the director is calling the viewers bluff.i doubt anyone on here will agree with me for fear of appearing like a philistine that just didn't get the 'deep direction' but hey ho.And one more thing. The sound effect used (repeatedly) like an orchestra warming up and crescendo-ing has been done before, properly, by Kubrick in 2001. Copying it like this doesn't come off as homage - just plagiarism.I became so bored I resorted to fast skipping some parts towards the end which I never do. But it's still almost 2 hours of my like I'll never get back.",1,32,103,18 June 2012
