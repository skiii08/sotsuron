The Legend of Bagger Vance," This was just what I needed
","I was so into the film while watching it that I was cheering and not blinking while  it lasted.The story is great,Charlize charming as always, and as for Will Smith,his part speaks for itself.I really like when a film carries some deeper massage, something  which applies to every situation in life.This was not only a story about golf,and as Bagger said in the film, this was not about winning or losing, there was a lot more than that.Trying to recover your life,trying to discover who you really are, without pushing things so hard.So whatever you do don't do it because of winning or losing or whatever that is, do it with your soul, try to find your 'authentic swing', your authentic you, listen to your guiding star, your internal voice, and be yourself. The film was a real refreshement.",Null,0,1,19 October 2001
