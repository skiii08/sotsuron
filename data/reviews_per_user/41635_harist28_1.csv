Sucker Punch," a poem that becomes a movie!!
","No words to say !! Its like , when poetry becomes a movies !!! I'm glad that the movie has 6.1 score because if everyone could understand that movie then a problem should arise to our mind.why the word we line in is like that? That movie addresses to few people!!!The colors, the pictures, the scenario, the words , the acting was perfect. while i was watching this film, i could image of an old person, in a peaceful place, talking to me about life and about my inner personality that controls my mind. Just like an angel. sometimes it is hard to face the truth that comes up from our soul. sometimes we know it is hard to look at ourselves, to put up a fight to our ego.what is the reality we have to defense? and what is the true meaning of the word reality? who teaches us what is real and how to laugh at lies? who chains us? and who holds the key that can set us free?",10,8,12,3 June 2012
