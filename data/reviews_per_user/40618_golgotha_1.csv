The Blair Witch Project," The most terrifying movie I have ever seen
","I was *crying* during the last hour of the movie; my wife was curled up in a fetal position and shaking.  I don't scare easily, either.  We haven't stopped discussing it since, and we both plan to see it again.  I'm not a film critic and so I won't try to offer any brilliant analysis here, but I will say that I recommend this movie to *anyone* who loves movies in general, because of the innovative way in which it was made.  My advice is to log out of this database and not attempt to read any more about this movie--the less you know before you see it the better.  Buy your tickets in advance--every show is sold out here in SF.",Null,1,2,19 July 1999
