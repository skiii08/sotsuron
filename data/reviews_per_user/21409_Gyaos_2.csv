Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a worthy successor.
","To the original trilogy that is.This movie just left me cold. The acting is flat, the characters remind me of cardboard cut outs, the plot simple, even predictable and the CGI effects are rather disappointing for the most part. Certainly the later don't make up for the rest of the movie's deficiencies, which are many.It seems Lucas chose to aim this picture squarely at a juvenile audience and disregarded trying to entertain anybody more than 10 years old.I found myself wanting this picture to end. I almost fell asleep on it. And did get up to heed the call of nature during the screening which is something I rarely if ever do while in a movie theater.As for Episode 2?I can wait.A *long* time for it.Sorry George, you blew it.",4,0,1,25 May 1999
The Mummy Returns," Almost Too Much
",That was my reaction when leaving the theater. It's a great movie and worthy sequel but I can't help but think that there was just too much action and not enough time to catch one's breath.,9,0,0,8 May 2001
