Walk the Line," Great movie about a great man
","Johnny Cash's whole life had movie material written all over it.From his time as a dirt poor sharecropper's son to his rise to become the greatest country music artist of all time Johhny Cash's life was just waiting to be made into a film.And this movie is a fitting tribute to Johnny Cash.Phoenix is simply perfect has Cash.No he doesn't sound like Cash,no one could,nor does he have the 6 foot 2 inch frame Cash had but he becomes Cash so much so that you have to remind yourself that is isn't Johnny Cash on the screen.Witherspoon is also good as June.With this role she will be seen as a serious actress and hopefully leave some of the sillier stuff she had been doing behind.The movie covers the period from Cash's childhood up until he and June marry.Its a great ride all the way.Cash is shown with all his faults---his addictions and his mood swings and his womanizing.But it also shows what made Cash the man he was and the things that shaped his music,such as his brother Jack's death,which seemed not only to shape his music but his whole life,and it also shows his enormous talents as he begins his recording career at Sun Records and touring with Jerry Lee Lewis and Elvis back in the early 1950's.One last note, Phoenix and Witherspoon do their own singing for this film and they are very good at that also.They are as good or better than most of the junk that is called country music today.Don't just rent this DVD,buy it,because you will want to watch it over and over.",10,4,7,5 March 2006
Dawn of the Dead," Most excellent remake of a classic
","This is one fun movie.I hate most remakes of classics,however this is a super well done remake.This is Zack Synder's remake of the George A.Romero classic zombie flick.A group of people are thrown together in their quest to evade the hordes of flesh craving zombies that have taken over the city.They hole up in a mall.The zombies in this film are fast and mean,like zombies on steroids.And there are thousands of them roaming the streets outside the mall.The mall group starts communicating with a gun shop owner trapped in his shop across the street.The gun shop owner and his desperate attempt to survive the zombie attacks all alone are very poignant and that is one of the things that make this film unique.The DVD package has a special feature where,Andy,the gun shop owner, videotapes his desperate struggle.This film has all the gore and blood that you could want.You ever seen a zombie woman give birth to a zombie baby? Well you will in this film.Thousands of fast moving zombies run wild in the streets in this movie perhaps fulfilling the vision that Romero had seen but wasn't able to finance back in 1978 when he made the original.This film may usher in a new breed of fast animal-like zombie that may change the zombie genre forever.But if not it will still be a cool gory zombie flick with a cast of thousands of panther quick zombies.",8,0,0,3 May 2006
Hostel," Not very good
","Even if Quentin Tarantino was involved in this film it still wasn't very good.It will hold your interest ,if for no other reason than to see what is happening to all the disappearing people.Some friends take a trip across Europe and they start disappearing after they reach this one particular town.The hostel that they stay at seems to be the hub of the disappearances.Eventually the awful horrible truth comes out of what happens to people who disappear.There are a lot of snotty Euro-trash roles in this film and that stereotype got old real quick.And some of their thick accents were a bit hard to understand until your ears adjust.There is some pretty intense gore scenes.One blow torch to the face scene was as gruesome as anything I've seen.But gore does not a good film make.But it is well done with some good solid special effects.The acting is good and the story is decent but it really isn't the cool looking film that was presented in the trailers.Basically it just another silly-teenagers-getting-hacked-up movie when you boil it down to the bones but the reason for their deaths is at least fairly original.I just can't believe that this thing got such raves when it was shown at film festivals early on.What have these people been watching to rave so about this run of the mill gore film?The thing about this film that kind of irked me too is that it is so pretentious in wanting to make you think it is something more than just a slasher film.This movie ,and Tarantino,need to get over themselves.It is worth a 2 buck rental but it isn't a DVD I would add to my collection.",4,0,0,2 May 2006
Hot Fuzz," rather disappointing ,honestly
","I really had high expectations for this film.I mainly wanted to see it because I enjoyed 'Shaun of the Dead' so much and this film had many of the same blokes in front and behind the cameras.Sadly it wasn't nearly as good as 'Shaun'.A hot shot London cop is transferred to a sleepy country-side village after his gung-ho attitude starts making his superiors look bad.His partner is the police chiefs dim-witted son.But the pair soon discover there is a sinister reason why the quiet little village has very little crime.The first 2/3 of the film was pretty good as the pair attempts to figure out the reasons behind a series of apparent accidents that leave some of the townspeople dead.The last 1/3 of the film completely ruins the first 2/3 as it breaks down into a drawn out shoot out that parodies many cop films from the last few years.The shoot out is dumb without being funny and the parodies are so self-conscience that they lose all impact.Now there were a few very well done gory scenes and a few laugh out loud funny bits but there just wasn't enough of either of them for the 90 minutes that this movie lasted.For some reason this film was rated R but there was no nudity ,very little profanity and just the couple of gory scenes.This is worth a rental but not one I'll add to my collection.See 'Shaun of the Dead' to see this gang's best work.",5,0,1,6 January 2008
Ed Wood," I love this film and you will too!
","You don't have to be a Johnny Depp fan to love this movie.He is excellent but so is everyone else who appears in this great movie.Tim Burton directed and the love he has for his subject shines through very clear.This movie tells the story of real life movie director Ed Wood and his loyal pack of misfits as they tried to help Wood fulfill his vision of making movies ,even though he had no talent at all for it.Many of his movies are considered the worst ever made.And his 'Plan 9 from Outer Place' is usually considered the very worst film ever.Wood ended up making soft-core porn and drinking himself to death.But with this movie he will forever be remembered and loved.This movie,shot in black and white,will appeal to anyone who is a horror movie fan or a movie fan in general. Johnny Depp is wonderful in the title role.He plays the cross-dressing Wood with every bit of his fiber.Martin Landau,as Bela Lugosi,is as good as anyone I've ever see in any role.He becomes Lugosi so much you forget that it isn't Lugosi himself on screen.Watch this movie to see Landau if for no other reason.The humanity that Landau brings to his portrayal of the aging ,ailing, dope addicted Lugosi is so much more than you would ever expect from him.There are other familiar faces throughout this movie and everyone is superb.The writing is funny and dead on and the direction is perfect.This is one of those movies you will want to buy so you can watch it again and again. The DVD has many extras that are worth the price alone.",10,0,0,15 January 2007
Silent Hill," Huh?
","I'm still trying to figure out what the heck this lousy movie was about.Well no I'm not really.I could care less.All I know was that this movie was a waste of my time and I sure wish I had my two dollar rental fee back.To cure her adopted daughter of sleep walking the mother decides to take her to this town that the daughter keeps mumbling while she is doing her sleep walking--Silent Hill,West Virginia.The town turns out to be a coal mining town that has been abandoned.And this is about as far as I can confidently say I understood what was happening.After they arrive the movie becomes a mish-mosh of perpetual mine fires,crazy religious folk,a kid in a burn unit and lots of rain and barb-wire.Now some of the special effects were good and some of the monster things were quite good but there just wasn't enough of that.There was way too much of flashbacks and trying to explain the storyline,whereas a good movie is made so you can kind of get the story line as the movie is happening.And not only was it boringly bad it was long.Boy was it ever long.But even if you cut this mess down by 40 minutes it would still be a waste of time.Now maybe this movie would have made more sense if I had been familiar with the game upon which it was based.Maybe. But I shouldn't have to know the game to watch a movie.Also maybe I'll learn not to watch moves based on video games as they all tend to blow chunks.I'm not sure who exactly liked this movie enough to give it the 6.5 average it has--gamers maybe--but it was awful.Don't waste your time on this jumbled mess of crap.",3,2,3,23 December 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Spellbinding film!
","This is a beautiful spellbinding film.Though the box may fool you this is NOT a film for youngsters.It is rated R and contains some brutal violence but it is a magnificent film that will keep you mesmerized the whole time.A young girl in Spain during World War II finds a mysterious other world when her and her mom go to live with the girls step father.The step father is a cruel army officer who has no love for the girl and only tolerates her because her mom is carrying his son.This is a wonderful movie.It contains some breathtaking special effects but despite the subject it is not a special effects driven film.It is very much driven by the story line.The fantasy world is seamlessly interwoven with the real world drama that is unfolding.Now the dialog is in Spanish with subtitles but like all well made films that contain subtitles you hardly notice it.Once the film starts you are caught up and will be amazed at each turn with hardly a notice that you are reading the text.Give this film a look ,you'll remember it for a long time.",8,1,4,14 July 2007
Nacho Libre," Gotta love Jack Black
","While this movie isn't great you have to love the way Jack Black attacks a role.He goes full tilt all the way all the time.Black plays a friar in Mexico who leads a double life as a masked wrestler.He dreams of the big time but he and his skinny tag team partner just can't seem to find the key to winning.The film has some funny moments but they add up to scattered laughs here and there instead of a great solid laugh filled comedy.The film is by the makers of 'Napolean Dynamite' and it suffers from trying to be too much like 'Napolean Dynamite',with its sparse dialogue and funky settings and weird mannerisms of the characters.I think if this film had been just a bit more it's own picture and not a copycat it would have been a better picture.All the actors are good and the picture keeps you interested but it isn't great, just good.The only thing great in this film is Jack Black's non-stop energy.And that in itself is reason enough to see this film.",5,0,4,15 July 2006
The Bourne Identity," Pretty bland for a thriller
","This was a pretty dull and overly long action/thriller.2 hours of Matt Damon is just a bit much, after all the guy isn't exactly Jack Nicholson when it comes to acting ability.Damon is pulled aboard a fishing vessel with two bullets in him and no memory of his past.A metal cylinder found on him leads him to a Swiss bank to a lock box that has all sorts of alternate IDs for him and money and a gun.Then,for reasons he doesn't understand people start trying to kill him.He must survive these attempts and battle his way all over Europe to try and uncover what is going on.The action parts are pretty good but they are just too far apart and in between them are boring segments of him looking at maps and talking on the phone and driving and all sorts of dull stuff.Then its 30 seconds of action and then back to the maps or cell phone.Now how he could wake up and not know who he was but remember all sorts of fighting skills and martial arts and expert weapon use was a little cloudy.And one glaring mistake that this supposed super agent Damon made involved a red canvas bag.After he empties out his Swiss lock box he dumps all the stuff in it in a red canvas bag.Soon after he is spotted and chased and one of his pursuers goes as far as to yell 'You with the red bag,STOP!' So then what does Damon's character do? He continues to carry this bright red canvas with him through most of the rest of the movie all across Europe.Duh! And then I never quite figured out how he was able to roam all across Europe and get through and across borders so easily without being nabbed with everyone looking for him.Anyway I'm not a big fan of this kind of movie.We've seen this spy thriller secret agent stuff done to death.And Matt Damon was a lackluster choice to play the lead.He had pretty much the same expression on his face the whole movie,whether killing or making love.All in all this 2 hour movie would have been much better to cut out some of the slow parts and keep about 90 minutes worth.Of course that still doesn't solve the problem of having a dull actor in the lead.",5,1,3,21 January 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Worthy remake of a classic
","OK this is a remake, of which we get a lot of here lately.Most remakes I hate, a few I like.I like this remake.This isn't as good as the 'TCM' or the 'DOTD' remakes we got recently but it is good.It holds your attention and is tense and gory ,as we would expect.An all-American family ends up lost and stranded in the New Mexico desert and falls victim to a group of mutants descended from some folks who decided to hide out and remain in the desert rather than heed the government's warning and leave during the nuclear testing of the 1950's.So we get some mutants who are nasty mean and suffer all sorts of hideous birth defects.Pretty cool.The struggle of the all-American family to survive the repeated attacks of these mutants makes for a pretty good movie.Well at least as good as the restrictions of the rating system will allow it to be.I always want more gore and guts and boobies than an 'R' will allow but ,alas,we must take what we can get. Cool special effects and a good cast and tight direction make this horror film worthy to see.While not a great horror movie,it is a cut above most of the schlock we see here lately with the label 'horror'.",6,1,2,26 March 2006
Ratatouille," Boring movie
","The best moment for me in this movie came when it was over.This is a boringly bad movie from Disney-Pixar.A rat named Remy yearns to be a chef and he lives his dream by giving advice to an ungainly dishwasher in a snooty restaurant in Paris.The restaurant becomes the hottest place to eat and the young man becomes the toast of Paris.Now the animation is top notch,perhaps the best Pixar animation ever but what kills this film is the script.It isn't funny at best and is just plain dull at worst.I was wanting to like this film.Patton Oswalt,who voiced Remy,is a awfully funny stand-up comedian and I was hoping some of that would be displayed in this film.But it wasn't.You might as well had some Joe from off the street voicing Remy because there was no comedy to be had in this film.Oswalt was stifled by the terrible writing as was all the other people who gave voice to the characters.I never laughed once during this film and actually don't remember even smiling either.I wasn't alone.Very few folks in the sparse audience found anything to laugh at either.How this film is getting all these great reviews I haven't a clue.It must be folks who are grooving on the animation and aren't paying attention that the storyline and script are terrible.If I hadn't been bored to near sleep by this movie I would have gotten up and left before it was over.This movie stinks like bad cheese.",4,15,32,4 July 2007
The Exorcist," One of the top ten scariest
","This is a great movie that will continue to scare you even after multiple viewings.It's downright unsettling the first time you see it.A young girl,played by Linda Blair,begins to act strangely and when a myriad of medical tests fail to find a cause the thought begins to creep in that she may be possessed.This movie is based on the very scary book of the same name by William Peter Blatty and he does a super job with the screenplay to this movie.The direction is by William Friedkin and his pacing of this movie is perfect.All the actors are great,with the exception of Blair,who is a little too cutesy and a little too hammy in some places, at least until she is possessed and then she is quite good.Jason Miller, in his first ever movie role,as the troubled priest/psychologist is superb.Miller was a very interesting man who won a Pulitzer prize and dropped dead on stage during a rehearsal for a play.The DVD version of this movie comes with some scenes that were omitted from the theater version.The scene with the possessed girl walking down the steps upside down on her hands and feet will freak you out.I can't imagine why the original couldn't have used the scene at someplace in the movie.The gore and pea soup scenes are tame compared to some stuff we see today in movies but it is more the subtleties in this movie that will scare.A shadow,a figure behind a door or movement at a window are seen in our mind as something evil lurking nearby and we construct the scariness in our minds.Watch this movie with all the lights out late at night and then try and sleep without wondering what is under your bed.",9,1,2,29 October 2006
No Country for Old Men," Terrific Movie that lives up to the hype!
","For once an Academy Award movie lives up to the hype with this terrific picture.It was a great ride from beginning to the very end.A good old boy(Josh Brolin) out deer hunting one day discovers a drug deal gone bad out in a canyon in the wilds of Texas.Dead men and dead pit bulls and a truck full of dope and 2 million dollars in cash,he takes the cash and leaves the rest to the vultures.The bad men come on the hunt of their money and send the ultimate bad-ass (Javier Bardem) to hunt it down.This movie is great from start to finish.....the action starts early and doesn't end.I hate movies that spend 20 minutes setting the story up...this one ropes you in early and doesn't let up...The settings are all gritty and realistic....the Texas brush country and seedy hotels and trailer parks give this movie the real life feel and look that makes it a great ride.The script is sparse and thought provoking.All the actors were first rate and Bardem is beyond great in his role as the Terminator-like human killing machine.Tommy Lee Jones finally appears in a film worth watching with his role as the overwhelmed sheriff.The only distraction was Woody Harrleson,for some reason he just didn't seem to fit into this picture,maybe it's because he is playing his usual smart mouthed character that we've seen too many times from him, but anyway his screen time was short so that was a minor thing.Now to all the crybabies who didn't like the ending.....too freaking bad.....life doesn't always end all neat and tidy.I thought the ending was perfect.....I sit there stunned and then smiled....I knew I had been taken on a hell of a good ride.Grow up and learn to accept a movie ending that doesn't spell it all out for you in a nice 5 minute recap like some cheesy TV show.I'll watch this one again and enjoy it all over.This is one to add to your home DVD collection.",8,2,10,24 March 2008
District 9," Great trailers,dull movie
","I loved the trailers for this movie and really made an effort to go see it when it the first weekend it came out.I rarely go see movies at theaters and almost never try to go the first weekend one opens but this one looked cool so I gave up a Saturday night to go see it.A huge alien spacecraft becomes disabled and its one million occupants ,yes one million,are put in camps,sort of like the camps where human refugees are put now.The big mother craft just hangs up in the sky low to the ground unable to move.Soon the camps become like any other camp where beings are forced to live in squalid conditions--crime ridden and violence filled hell holes.The aliens are sort of big insect looking things.Most of the movie is told from the viewpoint of the man who was put in charge of relocating the aliens when the camp becomes too much of a problem being located near a large human population.I didn't really understand why a million of these things would be flying around in space and how you would get a million in the spacecraft they came to Earth with.Their home planet apparently wasn't destroyed because some of the more industrious aliens were trying to get back to the mother ship and fix it so they could get back home.And they can build this incredible massive flying craft then they appear stupid and lazy when the are in the camps....eating cans of cat food which were used as currency in some cases,and also eating old tires.The whole cat food business was just stupid and silly and distracting.I think I would have liked the movie better had the aliens been more menacing,instead of the dullards they were.The film is done in a sort of documentary type although it doesn't hold too strictly to this style.The action is good when it finally starts and the special effects are pretty cool with space guns that explode people and stuff like that.And the big space craft looked cool hanging in the sky.But overall the movie was rather bland and boring in dealing with this problem of space alien refugees.Maybe the whole point was to deal with these aliens like we humans deal with other human refugees but if you are going to do that why use space aliens? This wasn't a bad film.It just didn't live up to it's potential and certainly not to it's trailers.I wish I had my $8.25 back I paid to see this movie.That would rent me 4 DVDs of movies that would be at least,if not more,interesting than this movie was.I gave this movie a six which to me means a decent watchable film but nothing that you'll remember as being extraordinary enough to go out and buy when it's released to DVD.",6,4,11,16 August 2009
The Mist," Run of the mill sci/fi horror stuff
","While this movie wasn't terrible,it wasn't that great either.It was just another average stop in a long sad road to find well done horror movies.I'm never sure how run of the mill stuff like Jessica Simpson,Justin Timberlake and this movie get such rave reviews but to each his own I guess.After a storm moves thru a small town a bunch of people end up in a grocery store trying to stock up on some supplies when a mysterious mist descends over the town.The people in the store soon find out that this isn't an ordinary mist but one that contains all sorts of mean critters.They struggle to survive and figure out just what has happened while trying to keep the meanies from the mist from getting inside.Now the movie has a interesting plot being based on a Stephen King story but it doesn't always carry the plot so well.The action lags at times and there is way too much jabbering by the required religious nut-case,played by Marcia Gay Harden,that Hollywood always seems feel a movie like this needs.The actors are all pretty good ,you'll see several familiar faces among the crowd in the store.The characters themselves were pretty clichéd however,like I said a religious nut is only one of the time worn characters in this movie.You'll also see the good ol' redneck boys,the angry black man,nervous shaky guy,nerdy guy who is really a Clint Eastwood underneath,biker dude,spunky old woman ,well you get the picture.The gore is pretty sparse but well done when it's there.The creatures themselves were pretty much a big let down....I've seen their likes in other movies of this type and an unoriginal monster really ticks me off....it's my horror movie pet peeve I guess.And the so-called 'surprise ending' was totally telegraphed cause I've seen the same type ending in other movies of this type too.If it sounds like I've seen this movie before ,I have,at least bits and pieces of it in lots of other horror movies.If you've not seen lots of horror movies this one will be pretty good for you I suppose.But if you're like me and have seen hundreds of these things you'll figure out that this ones brings nothing new to the table and even worse brings a lot of worn out clichés from other better done movies.I want a movie to make me love it or hate it and this did neither.It was just sort of there.",5,0,1,6 April 2008
I Am Legend," This film isn't legendary
","It isn't a terrible film,it just could have been so much better.It went through the motions instead of actually doing the real work of being a good spellbinding movie.This is at least the 4th movie made from the awesome book 'I Am Legend' by Richard Matheson.In this movie Will Smith is a lone survivor of a virus that wipes out mankind.He is an Army scientist or was before mankind all died.He ,along with his dog,lives in New York City.By day he has the run of the city by night he must hide from the night creatures that seek food.The movie is killed by the slow pacing in the first 3/4 of the film.It just takes forever to get going and about the time it does Will Smith's character has a flashback or a dream about his family.We watch Will eat breakfast and run on his treadmill and go to the rental store to browse the DVDs.Then he'll have another flashback and then back to present day picking corn or some other mundane thing.With the PG-13 rating the scares and gore are pretty tame.I'd like the film to have been grittier and less glossy if you know what I mean.It doesn't have the look of the end of civilization really.I mean Will still has electricity and water,we are never told how,and he somehow has a state of the art lab in his apartment in which he does research to try and figure out what happened.And I found it completely silly that one of the scientists who was working to contain the spread of the virus would be the sole survivor.I mean what are the odds on that?And since the virus killed over 5 billion people there is a total lack of bodies anywhere around.Just a lot of things like that were glossed over and not explained.Spend more time on the gritty details and stop trying to impress me with big expensive computer hocus-pocus.The special effects are run of the mill explosions and stuff like that.The night creatures were hugely disappointing...the same pale skinned blue veined weirdos we've seen in a least a dozen recent films like 'The Messengers' and 'Silent Hill'.I mean come on at least give me an original monster.Will Smith is a good enough actor but a weak script and turtle like pacing of this film dooms it to being just another run of the mill horror/sci-fi movie.I was hoping this film would be great.The title of the Matheson book has always been one of the coolest titles ever,'I AM LEGEND',I mean that is just great.This movie is worth the admission price but not one to add to your home collection.Instead take your money and get a copy of 'The Omega Man' with Charleton Heston or better yet watch Vincent Price in 'The Last Man on Earth' or better still find a copy of the book by Matheson.He has written some very cool stuff.Another of his books 'TheShrinking Man' is one of the best books I've ever read.Even if this movie isn't perfect it at least has a cool title.",6,8,16,16 December 2007
Gran Torino," Eastwood knows how to make a movie
","Clint Eastwood is without a doubt the biggest movie star since John Wayne rode off the stage.Eastwood has done it all and his latest movie shows that Eastwood went from being a great actor to one of the best directors Hollywood has ever seen.In this movie Eastwood stars and directs.Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski,a retired auto worker,who is watching his neighborhood turn into a mixture of ethnic groups.Soon after his wife dies a group of Hmungs move into the house next to him.The Hmungs are a mixed Asian people who helped the US during the Vietnam war.Being a Korean war vet Eastwood has no liking for the Asians next door nor much of anyone else for that matter.He has two rather dopey sons who don't have much time for their old man and Kowalski ,being an equal opportunity hater ,seems to hate his own family as much as he does the blacks and Asians who are taking over his neighborhood.Kowalski's pride and joy is his 1972 Gran Torino that he helped build back in his days on the assembly line.The Hmung family next door has two teenagers ,a girl and a boy,who are soon at the mercy of an Asian gang who attempts to recruit the boy and harass the girl.The gang also develops a liking for the Gran Torino.Kowalski gradually builds up a grudging respect for the Hmung family next door.But the Asian gang soon makes life miserable for Kowalski and his new friends and he decides if the family next door has any chance the gang members must be taken out of the picture.This was a very good movie.Eastwood knows his stuff and it shows.As an actor or director he is among the best to ever appear on the big screen.He has a presence like no one since John Wayne.The movie wasn't perfect by any means.The two young Asian actors were surprisingly bad at times.I'm a bit shocked that Eastwood would allow some of their scenes into the picture and a few of the scenes were a bit off ,such as the scene in the barber shop where Kowalski was trying to get the young Asian man to learn to talk 'like a man'.That just didn't ring true for a gruff old man like Kowalski.But still these small issues aside this was a very good film.The ending was jaw dropping and totally unexpected and Eastwood used his own reputation to completely warp your perception of how this movie was going to end.I'll watch anything Eastwood directs and especially anything he stars in.While he may not hit the mark exactly on every film,who does,his body of work when it's all said and done will stand up against anyone in filmdom history,director or actor.Rumor has it that this may be Eastwood's last role in front of the camera.I hope not ,he is still more fun to watch than any of the little teenybopper crap-heads who some people laughingly refer to as 'movie stars' these days.But if it is his last acting role he ended his career with a very good film.Eastwood is one of the giants and we won't see his likes again once he wraps up his career.",7,2,5,10 January 2009
Black Snake Moan," What Hollywood thinks the South is like I suppose
","This movie isn't too bad but it isn 't too good either.I suppose this is what some Hollywood snot nosed producer thinks the South is all about.A down and out blues singer turned roadside vegetable peddler hooks up with the towns local white trash slut and he attempts to cure her unquenchable desire to be porked by any man she sees.The plot was OK and the story was pretty original and the acting was good but all in all this movie missed the mark.The unbridled sex desire of the girl was a bit over the top and the music that the bluesman,played by Samuel L Jackson,was throwing down was pretty lame.This movie would have been much better with some real blues song by someone who really knew how to do them.The watered down music in this movie really fizzled out instead of adding to the movie.Christina Ricci is partly naked most of the movie and she keeps her white panties spotless has she endures endless porkings while rolling around on the floor,ground,or truck seat.Anyway this movie is a bit silly in places,okay in other places but never really dull which rescues it from being a total waste.So all in all its a middle of the road watchable movie which in this day and age is about as much as we can expect from most of the films that are made.",5,3,10,7 September 2007
The Descent," An above average horror flick
","This is a movie by the same guy,Neil Marshall, that gave us 'Dog Soldiers',a great werewolf movie.While 'The Descent' isn't quite as good, the guy without a doubt knows how to make a movie.This movie is an England product and in fact it is a bit bothersome that the best of the modern horror movies seems to come from overseas these days.Maybe the US has enough horror these days without having to make movies,huh? Oh well as long as someone keeps making good horror movies....Anyway six women go into an uncharted cave in Appalachia and soon discover that they are not alone.They find themselves 2 miles underground with their original route no longer accessible.They battle with each other and the cave dwellers to try and find a way to the surface.What would live 2 miles underground in total darkness? It can't be anything good.This movie is well paced and well written and the acting is decent,although at times some of the actresses were emoting a bit too much.The gore is plentiful and the special effects are very well done.This movie will make you jump a few times.And I like that.The only downside to the movie I found was the darkness.Taking place in a cave there was a lot of darkness ,of course, and for me a dark movie has always been hard to follow even on a big screen in a theater.This movie was a bit hard to keep up with at times due to the lack of light,especially some of the fast paced fight scenes.I tweaked the brightness a bit on my TV and that helped some.Also some of the women have a bit of an accent that was hard to follow at times with the cave echo and the screaming.Even with six women there was no skin in this movie but the movie was so well done I didn't miss it much.This is a fairly original movie that will keep your attention throughout.For me a great a movie is one I'll rate an 8 or higher.I gave this a 7 because of the constant battle to see what was happening in the dark setting.While it may not be a great movie it is a cut way above most of the dreck that is called 'horror' these days.",7,0,1,7 January 2007

","This is one of the best horror movies to come out in years.And it is one of the best ,if not the best,vampire movies too.Not since Nosferatu have we seen a movie vampire who actually looks the part.These vampires aren't the count type of older films nor are they the punk or yuppie variety vampire that so many recent vampire films have given us.These vampires are the descendants of Nosferatu.They have the look of death and disease about them.An isolated Aslaskan town,cut off from the outside world and thrown into darkness for 30 days,is invaded by a group of blood thirsty vampires.A few of the townsfolk struggles to survive the onslaught for the 30 days until the sun rises again.This movie is a non-stop ride of terror and gore.The special effects are so well done and everything looks so seamless and real.Heads are hacked off with axes and it looks just like you'd expect it to look.There isn't any cutesy horror movie dialog or cheeky asides in this movie.This movie is all business.The vampires are disgusting blood soaked creatures who have spiky teeth and long gore encrusted finger nails.The vampires let out this terrible squealing sound from time to time that is bone chilling.And the scene that was played in the trailer where the woman invokes the name of God is as cool a scene as I've ever seen in a horror movie.A glance into an empty sky by Marlow the vampire says it all.And how much better a location can you get than a snowed in backwoods town in Alaska in the dark for 30 days?One of my worries before I saw this movie was sometimes when there isn't a lot of light in a movie I have trouble following the action . But that didn't happen in this movie.Even though most of it was in the dark there was enough light to see every gory detail.Thank you David Slade for that.David Slade did a superb job as the director.He built up the tension without a lot of those phony horror movie tactics and the lowers the boom when the time is right and never lets up.Hopefully Slade will get more directing chances after this great movie.All the actors were good in this movie but special mention goes to Danny Huston who played the vampire leader,Marlow.He was spectacular as he crushed skulls and tore out throats.This movie has restored my faith that there are still people out there who know how to make a great horror movie.I just wish it wasn't necessary to wade through 99 stinkers to find 1 great one like this.This is a movie that horror fans will want to add to their collection.It is worthy of more than one watching.",8,4,8,11 November 2007
Shooter," Decent action movie
","This is a pretty good action movie.Of course movies of this type have been done to death so it's hard to get too worked up about even a good one.But this movie is watchable and does what it does fairly well.A retired sniper is double crossed by some corrupt politicians and he doesn't take kindly to it.After being set up for a shooting at an event at which the president is attending the ex-sniper(played by Mark Wahlberg) escapes and tries to survive until he can figure out what is going on around him.The action is good and the movie has good pacing ,there isn't much time wasted in setting up the plot.Now the outcome is implausible to downright silly and some of the other events just wouldn't happen in a million years either.The script is pretty lame in some places.And I never knew how bad an actor Danny Glover was until I saw him in this movie.But anyway this movie knows what it is and it delivers on a somewhat worn out premise(all those Bourne movies plus a million more)of one man taking on the corrupt system that is trying to eliminate him.This movie doesn't aim for greatness,it's a run of the mill action movie and there is nothing wrong with that as long as it is done fairly well.And it was done fairly well in this movie.This is a rental only,not one to add to your collection.",6,1,3,18 August 2007
Donnie Darko," One of my top 10 all time favorites
","This is one of the few movies that I can't seem to forget.The first time I saw this movie it absolutely captivated me and it danced in my head for months afterwords.This is also one of the few movies I've ever seen that hold up after you see it again.It's maybe even better the second ,third,fourth time.Donnie Darko,played by Jake Gyllenhaal, suffers emotional problems and is tormented(or not) by a large evil looking bunny.While his world slowly spins apart the people around him seem to spin even more out of control while they watch Donnie and wonder what is next.This movie makes you laugh and makes you cry and mostly makes you think.It makes you think a lot.It's scary and weird but mostly it's a beautiful and oh so sad movie.Yeah I cry every time.I love this movie.It's got lots of familiar faces in it but it's not about who stars in it.The sum total of this picture is way bigger than the people in it.Jake is amazing however.You'll have to watch this movie.Turn out all the lights and start the movie and you'll never want it to end .It's a 10 if any movie was ever a 10.",10,1,2,10 April 2009
The Birds," You've seen it I bet
","While certainly not his best film 'The Birds' is without a doubt Hitchcock's one film that is most associated with him.Prehaps even more closely associated with him than 'Psycho' and certainly seen by more people more often than 'Psycho'.While not everyone can tell you who directed 'Psycho' most everyone will know Alfred Hitchcock directed 'The Birds'.A small California coastal town is invaded by hordes of birds that attack the town in one nerve wrecking wave after another.Of course with Hitchcock it isn't just a straight froward bird attack,it's that but it's also the psychological impact and interactions between the people that Hitchcock deals with under the stress from the attacks.The special effects from 1963 are pretty good.Although some of the flying shots of the birds are obviously transposed in and some of the mechanical birds don't look so great,it still holds up well.The worst part ,in regards to special effects,was when the kids were attacked at the school and run off down the road while under attack.Even as kid I never thought the kids running looked real.They just didn't move their arms or bodies like they were actually running wide open.Years later I read that the kids were actually filmed in a studio running on treadmills and the birds and outside background were added in later.And what can you say about Tippi Hedren? She is one of the most gorgeous women ever on film.She is pure class.I fell in love with her as a young boy watching this film and even today when I see her in this film she is still stunning.Everyone in this film is great for I suppose Hitchcock would have no less.Rod Taylor is a natural in his down to earth playboy role.Jessica Tandy as his mother plays her part as an over protective jealous mother perfectly.Look for Hitchcock himself appearing early in the film.He is the rotund fellow leading the pair of poodles .I suppose this film is more rightly called a thriller as opposed to outright horror but whatever you call it it is one of those classic movies that most everyone has seen ,and better yet,will see again.It is one of those films that I've seen a million times but on a cold winter night with not much else to do I'll gladly watch it again.",7,1,2,1 December 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Wooooo--Hoooooo ! I loved it !!!
","This is one of the funniest laugh out loud movies I've seen in a long long time.And I was relieved that my much beloved TV show didn't produce a bomb at the box office.I have watched The Simpsons since the beginning and I was afraid this movie would bomb and kill the series.Far from it.In the movie Homer is up to his usual shortcuts and laziness and after he pollutes the Springfield Lake so bad that the EPA takes over the town The Simpsons become fugitives running from the irate townspeople and the government.If you've watched and loved the TV show you will love this movie.There is nothing much different in the movie than the TV show ,other than vulgarities and nudity and obscene gestures,but other than that it is pretty much the same.That's right this movie has nudity.Take that Jerry Falwell.Now I've seen some reviewers say this movie is like the later day Simpsons show,good but not as great as the early years but I'm not sure I agree with that.It's true that The Simpsons TV show has declined a bit in the last 5 seasons but it is still the funniest thing on TV.This movie was better,I felt,than many recent episodes of the show.So my opinion is that this movie is indeed a closer relative to The Simpson's glory days than the current crop of shows.But anyway the movie is laugh out loud funny and I'm not that easy to make laugh out loud.If you like the TV show you'll like this movie and if you're one of the 3 people never to have seen the TV show I'll bet you too will like this movie.I'm ready to see the movie again and will want to buy a copy for the DVD bonuses and all the hidden stuff in the movie I missed at the theater.Here's to Matt Groening and all the Simpsons cast members-----thanks for a great movie and a great TV show and may Homer continue to f*** up for many years to come.And since you guys made a crap-load of money off the movie I'm sure we'll see a Part 2 very shortly.Woooo-Hoooo.",8,1,6,21 August 2007
