Miracle," First Rate!
","I'm a movie buff--If I like one, I see it again.  I've seen this one three times.  'Miracle' has it all--acting, plot, realism, fast-pace, and suspense.  It's an excellent sports movie representing the best of that genre.  Kurt Russell plays Herb Brooks, the hockey coach who forged his amateur team of all-star prima donnas into a family. Patricia Clarkson is Patty, his wife.  She is excellent and an underrated actress.These guys became a family and outplayed the Russians at their own game.Because I'm a special education teacher at the high school level, I look for films that exemplify courage, hard work, honesty, integrity and persistence to show to my students.  'Miracle' has all these qualities plus that indescribable something called passion.Highly Recommended.",9,1,1,28 May 2004
Minority Report," Sci Fi Flick That Hits the Mark
","Plan to be on the edge of your seat for this excellent offering by Stephen Spielberg. The year is 2054; the pre-crime unit headed by Tom Cruise has virtually eliminated murder in Washington D.C.  The creator of the program, Max Van Sydow is very protective of the program and will do anything to keep it from being taken from him.  Three psychics suspended in a watery solution regularly predict murders before they are committed.  Tom Cruise is haunted by the kidnapping of his six year old son seven years before.  He and his estranged wife (the relationship between the two is warm and believable) have abandoned their marriage because they both are in so much pain from the loss of their son.The sci fi is very believable.  People are identified in shopping centers by their eyeballs.  Cars speed vertically and horizontally on invisible tracks. I've seen the  movie twice and enjoyed it even more the second time.",10,0,0,20 July 2002
Erin Brockovich," Joan of Arc with Boobs!
","Julia Robert's in her best performance to date is Erin Brockowich, twice divorced, single mother of three, trying desperately to pay her bills. Her character is developed nicely and the film concentrates on that which saved it for me.  I had a difficult time swallowing the big corporations are evil, all low-income moms are great, all crusading lawyers who take 40% are wonderful, line of thought.  If you disregard the liberal message slant, you will find this film enjoyable and entertaining with good performances by Julia Roberts and her boss, Albert Finney as the ambulance chasing lawyer turned corporation buster.  There is also a strong performance by Erin's love interest, the biker next door who babysits her kids.",8,1,1,20 August 2000
Beauty and the Beast," Enchantingly beautiful rendition of the famous fairy tale
","Songs you won't forget, animation second to none, humor, beauty, a hilarious, as well as despicable villain.  It's all here in Walt Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. This film will be a classic.",10,4,5,27 September 1998
Brokeback Mountain," Broken Hearts
","After all the hype I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie on DVD. First of all, it's not about 'Love is a Force of Nature.' A tornado is a force of nature--that doesn't make it a good thing.The acting is outstanding as is the directing. This is an expertly made movie.I haven't heard or read of anybody else saying or writing this, but 'Brokeback' reminded me of 'Anna Karenina. In that classic by Tolstoy, Anna is a very sympathetic character, but her adultery with Count Vronsky has tragic consequences including her suicide. In 'Brokeback Mountain,' the people really affected by Ennis and Jack's love affair are their two families. Both are destroyed. Adultery always has consequences--bad consequences whether it is two men, two woman, or a man and a woman.Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist made the decision not to stay with each other but to marry and go on with their lives. When they made that deal, they should have kept that deal. By not doing so, they hurt their wives and children eventually destroying their marriages.Another lie I've heard is that this is about two gay men. Wrong. This is about one gay man, Jack Twist, and another more heterosexual man, Ennis Delmar who is obsessed with one male--Jack Twist. Along the spectrum of homosexual/heterosexual love Jack was over there, and Ennis is definitely over here. Jack has other lovers, he has to get sex in Mexican border towns, and eventually is having an affair with another man when he is killed. Not so Ennis. He loves Jack, true, but he dates other women. There will be no other men in Ennis Delmar's live now that Jack is dead. Ennis is not gay.I found this movie very powerful. I loved the women in the movie and think their roles are underrated. I especially loved the scene when Ennis promises to attend his daughter's wedding.Ennis is a good and tender man. I believed his character and thought the whole movie was tremendously sad.",9,7,34,10 April 2006
Chicken Run," Clay figures become objects of heroism on a chicken farm!
","In case you feel this film is just for children, think again.  Adults may well enjoy it more and appreciate the symbolism  more than their children.
 An excellent effort all around, CHICKEN RUN held me from start to finish. 
The chickens are so cute and imaginatively formed that you want to play with them.  Mel Gibson is great as the voice of Rocky the Rooster as is the British  actress who plays  Ginger, the leader of the rebellious chickens.
The analogy of the chicken farm as concentration camp may seem a little much, but it works here.  And the inspiring ending doesn't lay an egg.",10,0,0,5 July 2000
We Were Soldiers," They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore--But They Should!!!
","WE WERE SOLDIERS speaks with integrity of who we are--our brothers, our sons, our husbands, and our fathers.  The men and women who sacrificed their lives and their loved ones in theVietnam War are celebrated in this film.Mel Gibson should get an Oscar but probably won't, knowing Hollywood's notorious anti-war penchant.  At any rate, everyone should see this film because it is in one word, WONDERFUL!",10,3,5,13 September 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," Monster Hit--Deservedly So!
","The creativity, inventiveness, and over-all excellence of this film are superb!The logistics of creating these computer-animated characters, and I do mean characters, has reached state-of-the-art level.I truly loved Monsters, Inc.  I'm 56, and I bought it so my grandchildren can watch it at my home, but---truth to tell--I want to watch it again.",10,0,1,22 September 2002
Fargo," Technically superb, but ultimately depressing satire.
","FARGO is satirizing a kidnapping, a murder, and North Dakota, not necessarily in that order.  A very pregnant police chief, McDormand, an excellent actress, portrays Margie, the police chief who tracks down and apprehends William Macy, the Fargo car dealer who arranges for his wife's kidnapping.  He hopes to collect the reward money from his worried father-in-law and get himself out of debt.FARGO is depressing because this story is based upon a very real tragedy and the details of this event are anything but funny.  I was left with an empty feeling after seeing this film.",5,2,4,29 October 1998
The Aviator," Brilliant
","As a committed non-fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I was taken by surprise by his excellent performance in The Aviator. Scorcese also scores after the Gangs of New York failure.Cate Blanchett is wonderful as Katherine Hepburn. Her mannerisms seemed forced until I realized that her portrayal of Hepburn was more than superficial.DiCaprio as Howard Hughes conquers a difficult role. Hughes suffered from paranoia; he was also obsessive-compulsive with a fear of germs.The film masterfully shows how this illness progressed from minor eccentricity to major disability.This film is about more than one man's inner demons. The aviation side of the story is fascinating.All aspects of The Aviator are stunning. I loved the soundtrack, dialogue, costumes, and direction.",10,0,0,26 May 2005
Radio," We Are All God's Children!
","I teach special education at the high school level.  I showed this movie to the kids today after viewing it myself last night.  All I can say to the producers, director and financial backers of this film is-Bravo!There are two outstanding performances by Ed Harris as the compassionate high school football coach and Cuba Gooding Jr, the retarded black man whom Harris takes under his wing.  Academy awards, anyone?This movie could have sunk into hopeless pathos, but it never does.  It never loses its common sense.  We are taken on an emotional journey.  The football team, Ed Harris and his family, the high school, and the whole town become captured by the warmth, the love, and the decency of Radio.  He trundles into their lives with his shopping cart full of junk and old radios, not talking, merely existing.  By the end of the movie, Radio radiates happiness because he has found meaning in his life and the love of the whole town.I don't know how this works, but it does.  Sometimes, miracles really do happen!",10,1,2,20 February 2004
North by Northwest," Hitchcock, spies, an insurance salesman make for a great thriller.
","Hitchcock is at his best in this classic.  Cary Grant, Eva Marie Saint have great chemistry, and James Mason is a smooth, chilling villain.  Mount Rushmore provides great scenery, while an across country train ride, and an exciting hunt in an abandoned corn field keep the viewer on the edge of his seat.",8,0,1,27 September 1998
U-571," U-571 is a Must See for all Action/War/Drama Fans
","In a refreshing trend of portraying the military in a positive light, U-571 will hold your attention on all counts. I watched it twice consecutively because I liked it so well.  The battles between the destroyers and the submarines are realistically and authentically captured.  Forget the historically inaccurate label some of the comments have cited. The film is a tribute to ALL the brave Navy men in WWII and not meant as a documentary.The whole family will enjoy this one!",10,1,9,28 October 2000
Spider-Man," Move Over, Superman! Spidey is Here!
","I loved the authentic New York City setting of Spiderman so appropriate after 9/11.  Toby Mcguire did a outstanding job as Peter Parker.The story builds slowly but inexorably as Peter slowly morphs into Spiderman.  Peter lives with his elderly aunt and uncle.  The uncle, played by Cliff Robertson tells Peter prophetically, 'With great power comes great responsibility.'Small children might be scared of the Green Goblin, frighteningly played by William Defoe.Very enjoyable movie.",8,0,0,15 September 2002
No Country for Old Men," No Movie for Movie Fans
","When Josh Brolin gets killed 15 minutes before the end of this movie, I should have turned off the DVD.The psychopathic killer who chases Josh Brolin all over Southwest Texas became so boring, I wanted to yawn every time he stared at someone, every time he flipped a coin so see if they died or not, every time he entered a scene.This is not a 'best picture.' 'Atonement' was robbed.I guess Tommy Lee Jones' character, the sheriff, is supposed to be deep. He is tired of the vicious killing. He doesn't understand it. By the end of the movie you don't care if he does or not. You just want the whole thing to end before it puts you to sleep.Just another chase movie but no fast cars.",7,3,6,30 March 2008
Saving Private Ryan," SAVING PRIVATE RYAN depicts America at its Best!
","Having put off seeing this film for months because people said it was 'graphic, violent, and bloody---I finally saw it yesterday!  I am extremely grateful I did!  Yes, the landing at Omaha Beach on D-Day was realistic, to say the least, but it showed what the men of WWII actually experienced better than any book could possibly do.  Stephen Ambrose, the WWII historian and consultant on the film, has given it the highest marks for realism.  If anyone has any idea of what it means to be an American, of how invaluable our freedom is, of the sacrifice that our forefathers made, let them watch SPR and feel no doubt.  Undoubtedly the best picture of 1998!",10,0,1,29 January 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," I'm Glad That I'm Around For This One.....
","I don't know Peter Jackson, and I've never been to New Zealand, but after the experience of this film, I don't need to.THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS is one of the greatest, perhaps the greatest, movies ever made.Jackson wisely does not attempt to duplicate the books--that would be artistic suicide because Tolkien's trilogy is unfilmable.  Jackson captures the essence and the excitement of the film with unbelievable integrity. 
The Lord of The Rings is a story of good and evil, of dark forces battling the light, of heaven and hell.  J.R.R. Tolkien had a profound Christian vision.  Every character is a prototype.  Frodo is the hero on a great quest.  Samwise Gangee represents everyman, essentially good and an unsung hero.  Gandalf, a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth.  Gollum is a tormented soul, evil, but an object of pity just the same.  Aragorn, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Woodland elf, all have their place in this tale.  The Orcs are the human/elf form corrupted beyond recognition.The battle scenes in The Two Towers are exciting and some of the best every filmed.  Computer animation works wonderfully with the Ents and Gollum.I am thrilled that Two Towers had been so popular and has made money.Bring on The Return of The King.",10,3,4,8 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," This is a Great One!
","I've already written one review, but I'm going to write another one after reading some of the nitpicky reviews.It seems that some people are DEEPLY OFFENDED when a film actually makes money, is wildly popular, a box-office hit, and artistically superb.I've read the books and seen both 'Ring' movies.  FELLOWSHIP was good but doesn't compare to THE TWO TOWERS.  The second film in this trilogy is a masterpiece.Peter Jackson has captured the essence and the spirit of Tolkien even if some details have been omitted.  How in heaven's name could he have put in EVERY detail.  The movie would have been seven hours long!One reviewer on this site actually said he didn't like the smile on a kid's face in the caves.The Middle Earth atmosphere, trueness of the characters, the magnificent battles, the spiritual imagery in every scene overwhelmed and humbled me at the same time.This is the best movie ever made.  J.R.R. Tolkien would have been proud.I am grateful that so many have the opportunity to see and experience this fine film.",10,1,1,25 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Loved It!!!!!
","I've now seen The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers four times.  It is the best film ever made.I've read the books but liked the movies better because I do not have a Tolkien fetish.These were the greatest battle scenes ever filmed.  I found Two Towers very spiritual and uplifting.   The scenery was breathtaking, the music superb as was the acting.I think many of the negative comments are written by people who like to knock a movie that is so popular.  Popular movies can have no merit because, according to the nitpickers, the 'masses' can't like a really good film.Don't listen to them.  Go see this and come away a better person.",10,0,0,20 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," STUPENDOUS!
","To anyone who is familiar with Tolkien's masterpiece of fantasy, Lord of the Rings, this movie is a gift.  Jackson has captured the spirit of this profoundly religious work--so much so that you don't even notice some of the details of the book that are missing.  The fact that the movie is so universally popular is wonderful.I sat entranced throughout the picture watching the actors, the beautiful, on-location scenery, the panorama of the story unfold before me in a magical, wonderful fashion.I could tell that the actors were playing their roles with belief in their hearts.  I think this is the best movie I've ever seen, and I have seen some good ones.  Amazing!",10,0,0,22 December 2002
The Incredibles," Fantastic!
","I loved this movie. My two granddaughters, four and seven, loved it too. The Incredibles is one of those few films which all generations enjoy. Brad Bird who collaborated with Pixar to make The Incredibles previously produced The Iron Giant, another great movie.The technology has become so advanced that the pictures we are seeing on the screen look real. The voices were also excellent with Craig Nelson voicing Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible and Holly Hunter as Helen Parr/Mrs. Incredible.The family is darling--all three children. Violet, the pre-teen going through puberty, Dash, the middle child, frustrated because he can't show how exceptional he is. Even Jack Jack, the baby, has hidden powers which don't become evident until the end of the film.The villain of the piece is Jason Lee playing Syndrome, The Incredibles' nemesis.There is humor and loving affection among all the family members and their friends. Samuel Jackson is excellent as the voice of Frozone.10/10",10,0,1,28 March 2005
Rules of Engagement," One of the Year's Best!
","Rules of Engagement is a thoughtful, excellently directed, film with some great acting by Samuel Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones.  The marine corps is portrayed with pride and realism.  There are no easy answers to the problem faced by Jackson who gives the order killing 83 civilians in a hostage situation.  Ben Kingsley and Ann Archer also give good performances as the timid, self serving Ambassador and his Machiavellian wife.Samuel Jackson is a flawed hero but one who is sympathetic and understandable.  Tommy Lee Jones, as the Marine Corp best friend, who defends Jackson at his Court Martial gives his best performance.Highly recommended!",10,3,9,16 October 2000
The Artist," Fantastique!
","I just saw this film and will probably see it again. I'm sure that one can't absorb all the magic the first time. This movie is about a silent film star who cannot adjust to 'talkies.' He meets a young dancer, Pepe Miller, who is set to go places in in the movie industry.The film is largely silent with a wonderful musical score which soars. The black and white background lend itself the the nostalgic feeling and evokes the right emotion.I must mention the little dog which stole the show. He is Valentin's faithful companion throughout all his trials. The dog is so good, he almost deserves his own award.Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer.",10,8,14,11 February 2012
The Great Raid," Excellent!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Based on actual events, The Great Raid tells of the rescue of 500 American POW's interred in the Philippines by the Japanese. The Japanese, during WWII were fanatical fighters and brutal captors. They considered surrender dishonorable not only for themselves but for anyone who surrendered to them. To be a prisoner of the Japanese during WWII was to suffer.These 500 Americans were scheduled for execution by burning as hundreds of prisoners had perished before them.Another overlooked fact about the war in the Pacific was the bravery of the Philippine people, both their soldiers and civilians.This movie hasn't been a big hit so far, but it deserves to be.",10,5,8,18 September 2005
The Red Violin," A Masterpiece of Cinematic Art
","If you don't see another film in your life, see 'The Red Violin.'   The story of the red violin, its conception in Italy, its passing from owner to owner, until   the present is engrossing and totally believable. 
As the story unfolds, the audience becomes part of the story.  The red violin takes on a life of its own encompassing within itself some of the passion of each of its owners.Highly recommended for the discerning moviegoer.",10,0,0,24 January 2000
The Untouchables," Depression era Chicago where Al Capone and Elliot Ness square off!
","One of the best mafia films ever made and one of Kevin Costner's best also. DeNiro does an excellent job playing Capone capturing all his menace and bluster. Sean Connery and Andy Garcia playing respectively the Irish cop who helps Ness and a rookie Italian cop who is an ace shot are as good as Costner! The atmosphere of the film is enhanced by replicating the clothes, hair styles, and mannerisms of 1930's era Chicago.One of the best shoot-outs ever filmed. Lots of violence but intelligently done.9/10",9,1,1,27 September 1998
When Harry Met Sally...," Can two good friend by lovers?
","What can I say?  Soundtrack is singable, quotes too many to cite, every line and situation real, and every part played to perfection in this, my all-time funny love story of the 80'sA perfect relationship story, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, may be watched again and again--each time picking up nuances and lines that one missed the first time.I identified with the characters, their situation, and their problems.  I've watched the movie eight times.  It shows how we are with each other.",9,1,2,27 September 1998
The Holiday," A Pleasant Surprise
","I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did. Although it is fluff, it is very good fluff. The acting by Diaz, Winslett, Law, Black, and Wallach is excellent. Each characterization is done more superbly than the next. The chemistry between the love interests is great.I watched it on DVD and wished I had seen it in the theater. 'The Holiday' left me feeling good with a smile on my face.The subplot between Iris (Kate Winslett) and Arthur (90-year old Eli Wallach) was very sweet. Also for those who think Jack Black is little too much, don't worry. His character is warm and vulnerable, and I found him totally believable in his role.What more can you ask of a romantic, escapist comedy?",10,2,3,6 August 2007
The Green Mile," Condemned Black Man as Christ Symbol!
","A great effort all around, THE GREEN MILE  is well worth seeing.  Superior performances by all the cast including the newcomer who plays John Coffy, the condemned man accused of the heinous killing of two little girls.Symbols abound including unexplained miracles, the transmitting of pain and suffering into John's body, the sadistic cruelty of  people, and the tortured, painful yearnings of all of those who seek after truth and justice.THE GREEN MILE is a much superior film than THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  The 'Mile' never sinks into formula or sentimentality as the 'Redemption' does.
Highly recommended for adults and mature teens.",9,0,0,11 August 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Back to The Future
","I rank Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Episode III right up there with the first Star Wars. I would have give it a 10 except for the hand-wringing angst about childbirth.Altogether, this episode makes for very pleasant outing at the movies. The special effects have improved tremendously in 20 years, but that isn't why this movie is great. The atmosphere of the first film is present in this one.Watching Anakin Skywalker turn into Darth Vader is fascinating.All actors do a credible job including the guy who plays Obi Wan Ka Nobi, reprising the Alec Guinness role from the first Star Wars.I was made uncomfortable by the sly political commentary throughout the film. Obviously, George Lucas doesn't like George W. Bush.All that didn't keep me from thoroughly enjoying Star Wars: Epside III, Revenge of the Sith.",9,2,7,29 May 2005
Beowulf," Wow!
","This I have to see in 3-D. I am hoping to get out of my little town, to to a big city and do just that.Beowolf the movie is BASED on the classic tale. It is not the SAME as the epic. So purists relax. Just sit back and enjoy the spectacle.I have to see this again.Great lines-- 'I have always loved you my queen.' 'And I, you, my Lord.' 'You are Beowolf--slayer of monsters and hero. I will hear no more.' For people who like Scooby Doo, Beowolf won't do it for them. Needless to say it did it for me.I guess as a devotee of 'Lord of the Rings,' I am a sucker for this kind of thing. But give me more.I loved Beowolf!",10,8,17,18 November 2007
Amélie," Different! But I liked it!
","I loved the girl who plays Amelie.  She has black eyes, short black hair with bangs, and one of the most expressive faces I've seen in films.The story pulls together an intricate plot with all English subtitles.I could totally relate to Amelie's introversion and shyness.  Her cold childhood made it very difficult for her to relate to people on a personal level.  She resorts to helping people anonymously.Unexpectedly, on one of her errands of mercy, she falls in love.How that situation is resolved, I will let you find out from watching the movie.9/10",9,0,1,3 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Whew!
","I've now seen 'Return of the King' two times.  It delivers!  Peter Jackson deserves the well-earned kudos he is getting for the difficult achievement of translating Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth to the wide screen. 'Fellowship of the Ring' was good; 'The Two Tower' was the best film ever made.  And this final installment is very good, but not as good as 'The Two Towers.'  The final installment of Tolkien's trilogy is definitely the most difficult to translate to the screen.One point which I would like to make that I've not read anywhere else except in Michael Medved's review of this film is the poor job done by Viggo Mortenson.  He was absolutely splendid in 'The Two Towers,' but in 'Return of the King' he seems to have lost some of his confidence.  He never takes hold of the role of Aragorn as he does in the two previous installments.In spite of the long running time, 3 hours 20 minutes, and the many diverging story lines, this is a splendid film.  I cried at the devotion showed by Sam to Frodo.  And Sean Astin who plays Samwise Gangee should get an Oscar.  The relationship of Sam and Frodo was the best thing in this last installment.Of course, the special effects are mind boggling.  Ian McClellan is superb as Gandalf.  He resembles St. Michael the archangel in his phsycial interpretation of the role.  You sense his great love for these courageous little hobbits and of Middle Earth.There are those who say J.R.R. Tolkien would have objected to Peter Jackson's interpretation of 'The Lord of The Rings.'  I think Tolkien would have liked it far better than most people think.  There never has been a more Christian vision of good versus evil translated to the screen.",10,0,0,21 December 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Epic Film Trilogy!
","I've now seen Return of the King six times and am in the process of listening to all three books on CD.  Without a doubt this film series is the best ever made.It was a very difficult task to translate J.R.R. Tolkien's vision to the screen.  I believe Peter Jackson did it best in The Two Towers.  The books are very wordy with much conversation and much description.  Tolkien actually read the books to a group of friends called The Inklings (one of the Inklings was C.S. Lewis).  When listening to the audio books, it is obvious that they are much easier listened to than read.  Tolkien's creation of Middle Earth composites and entire history going back before LOTR to The Hobbit and the Silmarillion.  There are many references in the book, LOTR to the First Age and the Second Age--many references to past battles, elves, and the men of Numenor.Peter Jackson has taken the story and pared it down to its essence, using wondrous special effects and computer animation.  He knows that the story is about Good Vs Evil, the ultimate power of evil to corrupt and mankind's effort to resist it.   Christian symbols abound throughout the movies. The light of Galadriel, who symbolizes the Blessed Virgin, the humility and cross of the ringbearer, Frodo, everyman Samwise who rises to greatness. Gandalf is also a Christlike figure, dying and returning again to serve Middle Earth.  I touch upon only a few.While many complain that this movie is too long, I believe Jackson actually had to cut a couple hours out of it.  There is simply too much to tell in ROTK to encompass under five hours.  The movie feels choppy in places.These criticisms in no way detract from the greatness of ROTK.  Watching it in conjunction with the first two films, The Two Towers and Fellowship of the Ring is an experience which I recommend to everyone but small children.",10,0,1,27 January 2004
Tarzan," Top-rated entertainment; perfect for entire family!
","Perfect animated film featuring the Tarzan story by Edgar Rice Burroughs which Disney faithfully adapts.  Much better than the hybrid 'Hunchback' or the depressing 'Pocohantas,' Tarzan scores a 10 in my book.  The scenery is breathtaking, making the African jungle realistic and beautiful. The characters are perfectly portrayed--Tarzan, Jane, Cerchak (the silver-striped leader of the gorillas) Tarzan's mother, his chums.The story is exciting, and the animation is simply marvelous.  The audience spontaneously applauded afterwards.  I loved it!",10,1,1,6 July 1999
A Walk to Remember," Lovely!
","I should never have put on my eye make-up before watching this movie.  I kept tearing up and wiping my eyes.A Walk to Remember is a love story.  Jamie Sullivan, played by Mandy Moore is the Christian girl and Shane West plays Landon Carter, the rabble rousing, anti-authority 'cool'teenager she loves. Landon is embittered by his parents' divorce.  His father is a successful doctor who has left Landon's mother for reason's unspecified.  Landon is drifting, getting into trouble, one of the leaders of the 'in' crowd when he runs afoul of the law.  Part of his probation is tutoring after school, doing janitorial work, and acting in the school play.  He meets Jamie, who also tutors and is in the play during this probation.  Jamie is a committed Christian--innocent but sweet and strong in her beliefs.  The sparks between Jamie and Landon start to fly the opening night of the play.  Jamie is too shy to say how she feels, but when she sings, her heart shines through and speaks to Landon.  He can't help but respond.Landon's transformation from surly, cynical 'cool' guy to loving, goal-driven, caring person is a joy to watch. At first, he finds it difficult to be without his former comrades, but after a while, they become boring to him.  Jamie believes in him.  He starts to want something more. The relationship never rings false.The only quibble I could have with this fine film is the way that Jamie dresses.  It is entirely possible for a woman of faith to dress fashionably. They have Jamie wearing an old grey sweater most of the movie as if to say that if she wore pretty clothes, she couldn't be a Christian-NOT!!I highly recommend this film.  I've seen it three times.",9,0,0,28 July 2002
Gladiator," Roman Spectacle Movie Revived!
","In the tradition of Ben Hur and Spartacus, Gladiator scores big.  Russell Crowe as Maximus, the Roman General, is magnificent.  Life in Rome in the second century A.D., is portrayed realistically.  The battle scenes at the beginning of the film take your breath away with their excitement and authenticity.Highly recommended.",9,0,0,24 November 2000
The Bourne Supremacy," Superior Action Film...
","This is a superior action film with the added bonus of good acting by Joan Allen, Matt Damon, and Karl Urban among others. The camera work is amazing.I especially liked the on-locale settings of Russia and Germany.Jason Bourne is a walking CIA specimen whom the agency deems to dangerous to live. Not all the facts are known about some mysterious murders in Berlin but Jason Bourne is suspected. You know his idyllic life on a remote island will be blown from the first.How this all is resolved takes the viewer on a non-stop chase through various foreign countries. Good flick!",8,26,36,12 September 2004
Cinderella Man," Inspiring Story and Top Notch Acting
","Russell Crowe deserves best actor, and Paul Giamatti deserves best supporting actor in this true boxing comeback story.Ron Howard has become an excellent director.Although my parents described the Great Depression to me, this movie made me experience the poverty and despair as if I were living it. Out-of-work men desperate to feed their families, no jobs, no hope, and no money.Jim Braddock has to put his family on relief. As soon as he has enough money, Jim goes to the welfare office and pays back every cent. Incredible as this seems to us today, to Jim and his generation--it was the right thing to do.I haven't been so moved by a movie in a long time.10/10 but keep little kids away because of some gory fight scenes.",10,2,2,12 June 2005
Atonement," Passion, Truth, Repentance, Atonement
","This is a lovely film with incredible acting by characters who never leave you. The setting is England in 1935, a country estate, right before WWII.'Atonement,' based on the novel could have been a very pessimistic, sad affair because of the unfair accusation against Robbie, the son of the family's housekeeper. It never is, though, because the passion between the leads, Keira Knightly playing Celia and McCvoy, as Robbie, is so human and redeeming.This is a beautiful movie, which begs to be seen again. There are many nuances not caught the first time which the second time can explain better.The young girl, Briony, who makes the false accusation suffers her entire life for ruining her sister's and Robbie's lives. She was only 13 at the time,with an overactive imagination, burgeoning hormones, and equal parts innocence and spite. Her emotions overtake her--resulting in tragedy. In the end. the book she writes names names and gives her sister and her lover the happy ending they never had.Definitely a keeper, 'Atonement' is an excellent film of the highest caliber.",10,3,6,17 January 2008
The Island," Surprisingly Good!
","Futurisitic film, 'The Island,' is set in the world of 2090. Two people, McGregor and Johannson, suspect that not all is perfect in their antiseptic environment. Supposedly, the outside world is contaminated and the only hope of the survivors of this global contamination is to win a lottery which enables the winner to a place on a paradise called, The Island.The movie is very exciting and moves along without skipping a beat. This film is also very pro-life as it shows the dangers of genetic engineering on human beings.It is difficult to describe the plot without spoiling the movie.The Island is chillingly realistic but ends on a note of hope.",9,0,3,1 August 2005
