Changeling," Didn't hold high hopes but it surprised me.
","This is a heartbreaking movie but well worth watching. Angelina does an amazing job as Christine Collins. I was expecting a hard to watch teary drama, which it could have easily been, but it has a lot of story and a lot of spirit. As a parent you will find yourself not wanting to even mentally put yourself in her shoes - too hard. I think it's great that this story has been told and it was a powerful, well directed movie. If you are bored and looking for a movie to keep you entertained for two hours this would be fine. I didn't really like John Malkovich before this movie, but he did an amazing job as the Rev. who helps Christine's cause while trying to expose the corruption of the L.A.P.D. If you aren't an Angelina Jolie fan you will still probably enjoy this as she is playing a character far from the sexpot chars she has been so great at in the past.",9,3,5,2 September 2009
