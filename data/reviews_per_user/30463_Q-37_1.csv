The Blair Witch Project," Amazing!
","I just saw this movie, and I have to say that it is the most gripping movie I've seen in a long time. While I didn't find it horrifying in a 'scared witless' sort of way, the superb acting and writing allows you to feel the psychological effects of the trip as if you were there. The unusual camera work and 'raw' feeling of the footage also helps to draw you into the movie. Amazing!",8,1,1,31 July 1999
