Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Another Indication Of The Depraved State Of Modern 'Comedy'
","Each new 'comedy' released from Hollywood these days seems to have one primary goal in mind; to be even more distasteful and sickening than the previous one. 'Borat' has been lauded by critics and fans alike. This is clear cut evidence that it is already too late to save our civilization. I don't want to sound like an oldster disparaging anything new; pushing boundaries can be done well, as is witnessed by the hilarious television shows 'Reno 911' and 'South Park.' The 'comedy' in this odious film is more mean spirited than the geekiest nerd could ever experience at the hands of his high school tormentors. The entire premise is borrowed from Howard Stern, who used it to much greater effect with Stuttering John, as he ambushed celebrities and asked them embarrassing questions. Of course, the gimmick was invented by 'Candid Camera,' which was original and kind of funny. Too bad it cleared the way for foul mouthed carbon copies like 'Punked,' and eventually this obscene movie.Cohen doesn't seek to skewer the powerful and pompous. He chooses the predictable targets in our politically correct society. How often can we point out that rednecks are stupid and gullible? Why is it still funny? But then again, how many times can Hollywood have a super model punch out a huge man, without people questioning it? The excruciatingly long nude wrestling scene in this movie qualifies as one of the most offensive (and pointless) in the history of cinema. Why does nudity in films now consist primarily of unattractive males showing off their decidedly non-appealing bodies? Are the makers of these 'comedies' trying to turn people off to sex?'Borat,' like the super bad films of Judd Apatow, Seth Rogen, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Mike Myers, etc., is your standard 'comedic' fare for this day and age- male nudity, loads of juvenile toilet 'humor,' repeated jabs at Christianity and southern white males, men getting hit in the crotch, etc. I can perhaps understand why 11-12 year old boys find this disgusting stuff funny, but the sad reality is that many, many allegedly educated and supposedly mature middle-aged adults do as well.",1,2,5,14 July 2009
The Longest Yard," Most Ridiculous Casting In History Of Film
","Adam Sandler as a football player? Come on, now! Okay, we bought it once with 'Waterboy,' but at least that was supposed to be a comedy and you could suspend your disbelief and buy what they were selling, just like you might have in an old Jerry Lewis movie. 'The Longest Yard' expects you to swallow the notion that a short, dumpy (if not chubby), completely non- athletic nerd like Sandler could outdo much bigger and faster players on the football field (many of them ex-NFL stars). Why not just hire an actor that at least looked like an athlete? Or, if you must hire Sandler (for whatever bizarre reason), shouldn't he at least work out a little bit so that he could be in somewhat better shape? Sandler's movies have been unwatchable for years, for similar reasons to this. Sandler must be one insecure guy, because every movie he has been in has cast him as some kind of tough guy, with him punching out someone at least once. That is almost as ridiculous as casting him as a football star. Like so many recent Hollywood remakes, there was no good reason to remake the original here.",1,8,18,27 May 2005
Source Code," Potentially Intriguing Turns Into Predictable Propaganda
","This movie could have been far more satisfying. You have to suspend your sense of logic, as you do in most sci-fi movies, to accept the premise that a dead soldier can be transported into the body of another man about to be blown up on a train. One question that is never addressed is; where did this man's soul, his personality, go during those eight minutes when Jake Gyllenhaal's character took over his body? Gyllenhaal is okay in the lead role, but how he can be sold as a sex symbol is beyond me. Those huge, bug eyes of his alone should turn off a lot of people. The lovely Vera Farmiga is excellent here, as always, but it's a thankless role and she isn't given much to do. Michelle Monaghan's character seems shallow and isn't developed at all (actually, none of the characters are developed whatsoever and come off as empty shells). The movie trots out two of its favorite, stereotypical casting devices; the head of the super secret project is one of those incredible black computer geniuses, which are usually played by Morgan Freeman. In any event, they are plentiful in Hollywood. And the bad guy, the lone 'nut' terrorist who is singlehandedly holding the country hostage, is a dumpy, very innocent looking white male. Wow- didn't see that one coming! Does the movie industry really think no one notices this kind of stuff? The movie borrows heavily from 'Groundhog Day' and other superior films, but the premise was interesting enough that, with a little more creative thought, and a better lead actor, it could have been much better.",2,0,4,6 July 2013
Inglourious Basterds," Another Gem From Hollywood's Most Obscene Director
","What is the fascination with Quentin Tarantino? He is the Larry Flynt of violence; reveling in it, smearing it all over the screen, forcing the viewer to overdose on it. His films are all about violence for its own sake; there is no greater artistic merit to this filth, no matter how many allegedly intelligent critics effusively praise it.The message this movie sends is truly frightening. The 'good guys' set out on a mission to brutalize the 'bad guys.' Our 'heroes' do nothing laudatory at all throughout the movie, except to violently destroy 'bad guys.' They have no scruples, no principles and no morality. This is typical of those who inhabit Tarantino's warped, pornographic world. As another reviewer noted here, this film unintentionally causes the viewer (at least those viewers with any semblance of decency) to sympathize with the Nazis. That certainly can't be what Tarantino was trying to achieve.'Inglorious Bastards' is political correctness gone amuck, armed with an electric buzz saw. The cartoonish caricatures, the vapid, sophomoric revision of history, the profane 'might makes right' credo- all of it should make any halfway intelligent and sensitive person cringe in disbelief. Brad Pitt's accent is about as ridiculous as any I've ever heard; he would have been laughed off the stage of most elementary school productions.Those who think our civilization is collapsing will not be comforted by this film. Tarantino is an overrated, vile filmmaker who has perhaps produced his 'masterpiece' here. Or at least we can hope.",1,31,82,23 August 2009
Forrest Gump," Overrated And Unbelievable
","The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal 'Bosom Buddies.' Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many 'good' and 'upright' citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better.",1,44,103,3 July 2009
Trouble with the Curve," Underwhelming And Predictable
","There are some good moments here, and the concept has potential; old time scout battling the new computer age. However, Clint Eastwood, as usual, is brutal as the central character. He has now turned completely into Grumpy Old Man, and hasn't departed from that role for several years; still whispering and squinting his eyes, and under-acting to the point of absurdity. At times, Eastwood barely seems alive on screen, an animated corpse whom the audience is supposed to love, in spite of his gruff, unemotional, unaffectionate personality. Eastwood's unfriendly old man persona is just one of the clich√©d, overdone aspects of this film. How many times has Hollywood featured an old guy that is too proud to admit an illness, unwilling to show his feelings for his children, and too stubborn to change his ways? Wouldn't it be refreshing if Hollywood produced a movie about an old guy who didn't cuss, wasn't angry, was emotional and affectionate to a fault with his family, was religious and not obsessed with sex and had no stubborn streak? Other parts of this film revolve around the film industry's hackneyed political correctness. Gee, who could have predicted that the arrogant young prospect would be white? And who could have foreseen that the humble and lovable 'peanut boy,' as the white jerk hotshot derisively calls him, would be Hispanic? And, more importantly, be a truly super pitching prospect who humiliates the white jerk in his practice debut? Amy Adams plays another oft-seen character, the strong, self-assured young woman who can outdo the boys at anything. It's actually amazing she didn't punch out at least one white guy during the film. If you enjoy the overrated Eastwood, you'll enjoy this film. If you have little patience with clich√©s, predictability and political correctness, you should look elsewhere for entertainment.",3,1,3,31 July 2013
Bad Teacher," America Continues To Sink
","Another comic 'gem' to satisfy the cravings of an increasingly stupid viewing audience, 'Bad Teacher' is accurately titled. Cameron Diaz, who is also a bad actress, is indeed very, very bad in this film. Her character is entirely absent any remotely positive traits. There's nothing to like about her, and yet we are supposed to root for her. A film with a title like this would once have been relegated to the porn industry. Now it's just part of mainstream 'comedy,' right there alongside other immortal classics like 'Super Bad,' 'Jack Ass,' 'Kick Ass,' etc.Yes, it was awe inspiring to watch dear Cameron fire balls at the heads of little boys. Not little girls, of course- that wouldn't be funny. It's only humorous to watch little boys in pain. Ha Ha. Think of it- the writers are depicting an adult abusing children, and we're laughing at it! Reverse the roles- can you imagine a 'comedy' where a male teacher abuses little girls, and the audience is amused by it? Several obvious sequels spring to mind here; Bad Student, Bad Principal, Bad Janitor, Bad Cafeteria Lady, etc. The possibilities are endless. The American idiocracy apparently have an unlimited appetite for these mindless, immature 'comedies' that could all have been written by 12 year old boys. I guess these 'writers' never run out of ways to portray farting, male asses and men getting hurt (usually by getting hit in the crotch). Thank goodness their 'talent' was recognized and is being put to such good use.Everyone who had anything to do with this monstrously bad movie should be ashamed of themselves. The messages it sends are horrendous. If 'bad teachers' start popping up in real life, they should never be held accountable for their actions, no matter how despicable they are. After all, Hollywood has told us that such creatures are hilarious, even lovable. So lighten up, it's all in good fun!",1,173,348,26 June 2011
Batman Begins," Very Good, But Has Flaws
","I'm shocked that none of the many reviewers here seemed to dislike anything about 'Batman Begins.' Yes, it had a lot of good qualities; Chrisitian Bale was wonderful (especially as Bruce Wayne), the legend was told well, Michael Caine and Gary Oldman turned in their usual solid performances, Wayne Manor looked great, and in fact all the scenes with Bruce Wayne rang true. However, there were also some negatives. First, Katie Holmes was ridiculous. No way could anyone believe she was a D.A. In fact, her character was unnecessary. Morgan Freeman played the same character he always plays, and was totally unconvincing as an outcast research scientist/inventor. The origin of the Batmobile here was very disappointing. A refurbished tank? Come on! The very, very long scene of this Batmobile on top of the roof, and then being chased on the highway, took up way too much time and left me bored. The fight scenes tried so hard to be intense (and the camera moved so fast) that the viewer couldn't even catch what was going on much of the time. I also thought the Scarecrow was a little lame. All in all, it was a pretty good film, but hardly the classic that most people seem to think it was.",7,0,0,26 June 2005
Bridesmaids," Fart Comedy Meets Chick Flick
","Every time I think Hollywood can sink no lower, they do. I guess this film is considered a great 'advance' in the field, because now these horrendous script writers and directors have shown that the girls can fart, defecate, curse and inflict 'funny' pain just as well as the boys.When will this idiocracy we live in finally get sick of 'humor' that would have been considered immature for 12 year old boys as recently as twenty years ago? When was the last time a 'comedy' was produced in Hollywood that wasn't based exclusively on potty humor and hapless males getting hit in the crotch? Lorne Michaels should be ashamed of himself, for forcing all these monumental no-talents on America. Kristen Wiig is merely the latest in a long series of thoroughly unfunny, untalented, obnoxious 'actors' like Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, David Spade, Rob Schneider, etc. Big screen comedies basically have been taken over by the pathetic alumni from SNL and the just as sordidly horrific 'talent' emanating from the stable of Judd Apatow.I wonder if Maya Rudolph-yet another ex-SNL cast member-can appreciate the irony of her appearing in a work of 'art' like this, considering that she was one of the stars of Idiocracy. Probably not, considering that none of the SNL people seem to have the slightest appreciation of the brilliant satire Mike Judge employed in that film. Instead, they continue to collect hefty paychecks for contributing ever more filth to our decaying cultural landscape.",1,79,165,28 May 2011
Kick-Ass," The Title Says It All
","It was really only a matter of time. The culmination of decades of brainwashing, dumbing down and awful, awful artistry have resulted in 'Kick Ass.' Yes, it was also only a matter of time until someone produced a movie with that title. Now that another cultural barrier has crashed, look forward to movies with cherished words like 'Retard' and 'Balls' in their titles. Use your imagination- it's easy to envision really profound titles by sprinkling in all those formerly forbidden words.As for the movie itself, Hollywood takes its most prevalent theme- that of females beating up males- and speeds it up to a wharp factor. First, the female doing all that ass kicking is 11. ELEVEN. And she isn't content to knock them out with one punch from her dainty fists. No, she gruesomely kills them. While enjoying it immensely. She also enjoys mutilating them in the process. The fact that any audience, anywhere, finds this graphic filth- which should by all rights be considered child pornography- entertaining at all is yet another sad indication that our civilization is beyond all hope. The violence in this film is so gratuitous, so disturbing, especially because it involved such a young girl, that it really wouldn't be any more offensive if the preteen actress was wandering around naked and having sex with adults, instead of gleefully murdering them.If there is any justice in this world, 'Kick Ass' will continue to under perform at the box office. The less money it makes, the better.",1,43,89,19 April 2010
It's a Wonderful Life," The Greatest Film Ever Made
","Frank Capra produced a quartet of timeless films that managed to combine a heartwarming sentimentality with hard edged social commentary. 'It's A Wonderful Life,' which was initially a box office disappointment, is his masterpiece. In my view, it also represents the apex of cinema, the finest achievement in the history of motion pictures. The irresistible plot borrows heavily from Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol,' but manages to put a unique twist on it; instead of Ebeneezer Scrooge being reminded by the spirit world of just how horrible a person he's been, George Bailey is reminded by the spirit world that he has touched the lives of countless people, and that the world would be a horrible place without him. James Stewart is perfect as Bailey, somehow 'aging' throughout the film, beginning as a believable college aged man even though he was thirty eight years old at the time of filming. Donna Reed is lovely, and the rest of the cast is filled with the type of character actors Capra's films were noted for. There is an interesting cameo from Carl 'Alfalfa' Swtizer, grown from his 'Our Gang' days into a gangly, rather homely teenager, whose prank sets off the unforgettable scene where Stewart and Reed Charleston their way into a swimming pool. 'It's A Wonderful Life' is that rare film that never gets old, never ages. The viewer can jump in at any point in the movie, and feel satisfied. The movie used to be played repeatedly by numerous channels during the holiday season, but in recent years copyright issues have reduced air time to only one or two broadcasts by NBC. Everything about this movie is first rate. The dialogue can be, and should be, quoted endlessly; it is filled with Capra's trademark pro- little guy populism. The final scene, where the cast sings first 'Hark The Herald Angels Sing,' followed by 'Auld Lang Syne,' never fails to bring a tear to my eye, from the moment younger brother Harry Bailey proposes a toast, 'To my big brother George, the richest man in town.' Capra's movies always inspired, but this one is in a class of its own. To watch James Stewart, cradling little Zuzu in his arms, while his friends and neighbors shower him with money and affection, is to understand how powerful this medium can be, and how in the hands of a truly good soul like Capra's, that message can be positive and uplifting. The lesson everyone should take away from this film is: 'It IS A Wonderful Life.'",10,1,5,27 August 2013
The Birds," Hitchcock's Finest
","I may be in the minority, but I feel that 'The Birds' was Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. The basic premise of the movie is as compelling as any can be; the feathered creatures in the trees and in the sky, which we all take for granted, suddenly begin acting strangely, attacking humans. Tippi Hedren is incomparably lovely as the heroine. One can understand why the sexually frustrated Hitchcock was so obsessed with her. But she's not mere candy for the eyes; Hedren turns in a compelling, underrated performance. Rod Taylor is fine, but is overshadowed by the stunning Hedren, who steals every scene she's in. One of the most memorable, visually impactful scenes in the history of cinema occurs in 'The Birds,' when Tippi Hedren sits down on a bench at the school playground to smoke a cigarette, and a huge number of birds, with eerie silence, gradually gather on the monkey bars behind her. Another classic moment comes in the diner, where the patrons express the growing panic of the sleepy little community, and an elderly woman, who is an ornithologist, defends the birds, and regarding any war with them, declares, 'Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance!' There is a bit too much gore in the film for my taste, and the ending has always struck me as unsatisfying, but overall 'The Birds' is a brilliant piece of work, by one of the all time greatest directors.",9,3,6,27 August 2013
