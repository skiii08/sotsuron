3:10 to Yuma," Instant classic
","Just when you think nothing else can be done with this ancient genre, along comes something like this! A simple, simple story, told straightforwardly, with grace and no sentimentality at all -- completely astounding, spot-on psychological portrayals by the main actors, and sure-handed technical expertise from both director and cinematographer. I can't say enough about the beauty of Crowe's and Bale's performances -- these two are gems, surrounded by solid gold supporting actors who managed to exude pure character from every line. Though I'm not really a big fan of westerns, there are a few which I have placed in the pantheon of 'must-see' movies -- The Outlaw Josey Wales, There Was a Crooked Man, True Grit, The Cowboys, Unforgiven, and now 3:10 to Yuma. I rank this an instant classic.",9,3,7,21 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," fun fun fun
","Not quite as tightly written or intimate as the first one, but WTH - this is fun fun fun. Despite some quibbles with the sheer length of this second installment, as well as some other quibbles with a few scenes that may have been somewhat gratuitous, the film delivers the same broad, bawdy chemistry as the earlier installment. There are some fantastic sequences, very well choreographed, as well as very good CGI on the various and sundry effects. Loved the bad guys. What's not to love about our returning good guys? Good play with the monkey as well as with the mysterious compass that doesn't point north. Many things explained, as well as many new questions raised. Can't wait until the third one weighs anchor!",9,2,5,7 July 2006
Constantine," fascinating
","I found it an interesting fusion of Catholic theology, folk tradition, and the sort of world-view philosophy most often found in speculative fiction. The cinematography has a gritty film-noir look which, though in color, enhances the morose mood of LA after dark -- plenty of shine,with equal amounts of smoke from the burning ghats. Scenes from Hell were, well, hellish; it was entirely apropos for the very air of Hell to remain in constant swirling motion. The rush and howl of flame and ash evoked the howls of the damned without beating us over the head with it. In keeping with the dark angst of the picture are the little touches of comedy, burnt-embers smuts here and there, and none of them that do not bring forth a round of highly ironic laughter from those in the audience with the wit to understand them. I also liked the dichotomy of the two main characters; cynical Constantine and sincere police detective. Many would have this film operate on firmer, more believable, more familiar ground. Give me the Great Mystery every time -- sometimes it's better to have cinema without complete safety.",8,3,19,20 February 2005
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," thank you thank you Del Toro
","What a wonderful display of this director's talents -- love love love all the clockworks in this movie; if imagination is a machine, Del Toro's is an incredibly complex, Goldbergesque windup of gargantuan size. How nice, too, to have such a wonderful ensemble of characters -- Hellboy himself is one helluva scene-stopper, but he in no way overpowers any of the others. They feed on each other -- and every single one of them is fully formed and three dimensional -- even the dimensionless gaseous ectoplasm. The movieworld universe has been immeasurably enriched! Hellboy originally was visually stunning, but Del Toro really has surpassed himself. He's even managed to surpass his own work in Pan's Labyrinth. Amazing. Simply Amazing.",9,5,11,12 July 2008
Silent Hill," stylish imagery....awful subject matter
","Went into this film for one reason only -- it was directed by the same man who directed Brotherhood of the Wolf. Stayed in the theatre, despite my husband's restless grumpiness at being forced to watch the subsequent splatter and gore, for one reason only -- Gan's directing. The man truly, truly understands the power of light and shadow, and has a delicate touch with not only camera angle, but also the composition of his shots. LOVED the creepiness and dreamy quality of the ash-covered, shadowless town, drowning in the constant silent fall of fluffy, beautiful, deadly ash. LOVED the way he frames faces (even those which we do not particularly want to see) in complex angles; doorways, set components, and juxtapositions of anatomy. LOVED his color control -- monochrome greys, sparked with crimson, hot orange, and purple; warm breaths of yellows and tender ochre acting as a heartbreaking contrast. He's not afraid to fade to black, or blank out the screen with a scream of white, either. Though this film had plot and characterization inadequacies, and though I feel that it was a subject unworthy of this director, the images in it and the psychological enigmas reinforced by that imagery are very compelling. Gans is a master, though this is not his masterwork. Can't wait for the next one. The man is a cinematic artist.",7,0,1,22 April 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," Lush, lurid, and very, very beautiful
","I simply cannot rave enough about this film. Thank you, del Toro, for bringing us such a multi-layered, beautiful story set like a fire opal against the stark matrix of civil warfare. An instant dark fairy-tale classic for a complex modern world; villains whose motives we comprehend, yet cannot condone, classic nythic formulae served up ice-cold, just as the brother's Grimm would have it, and startlingly inventive visual effects to enhance and enlarge the film's fantastic characters. And all of this balancing on a razor's edge of reality. I'm still trying to think up ways to use it in my English honors class. I set this one right up there with 'Cite des enfants perdues' and -- creative story-telling and visual imagery some of the best I've ever seen. Quite simply, 'Pan's Labyrinth Kudos and more kudos for this highly original work! In many ways, the film itself is a labyrinth: a new surprise around every odd bend.",9,2,5,19 June 2007
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Captures the tone
","Although I've read all three of the books (structurally, they're really 3 installments of one big honking novel), I haven't seen the Swedish movies. Forget about the books. Forget about the other movies. On its own, this adaptation does manage to capture the general tone and resonance of the novels, and it does this with admirable brevity and to-the-bone editing. There is a bleakness in the novels that is nicely encapsulated by the exterior and interior backgrounds. Snow. The sterility of Martin Vanger's modern house on the hill. The cool patina of years on the old cottage's walls, furniture, and stonework. The camera dwells on Lizbeth Salander's inexpressive face and you can almost hear her complex gears spinning away. The lighting director in this film is a genius -- and so is the cinematographer -- emotions are relayed in light and shadow so well, and the camera angles nudge our tensions without being overt about it. It's not perfect, of course. No movie version of a well-plotted novel ever is. But it strives to do the story justice, and manages to accomplish its task.",8,4,9,23 December 2011
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," delightful complexity
","Whoa, what a tsunami of detailed information, half-seen side attractions, and really elegant special effects! I'm going to have to see this one several times, I think, before I've gleaned a comprehensive understanding of the depth of this world. First off -- Scamander's suitcase (which is the reason I put a spoiler warning on this, in case someone would rather see the film without knowing anything at all). When I get this on DVD, I'll probably watch this section over and over -- looking in the corners, trying to peer off-screen. It's a cornucopia of sensory overload -- part sideshow, part impromptu zoo, and wholly engaging. I definitely empathize with the hapless pastry chef, Kowalski, as he staggers into unimaginable vistas and through canvas apertures that turn out to be dimensional engineering portals of which even the Time Lords of Gallifry would be envious. Next: Scamader's mating display on the ice in Central Park. It was really, really hard to stop laughing at that one -- I was strongly reminded of the ostrich scene in The Gods Must Be Crazy II. So DANG funny, and visceral -- Scamander is the ultimate crypto- zoologist/magicanimalian behaviorist! Engaging minor characters, a plethora of detail, and the big realization at the end that made me slap my forehead (well, DUH, of COURSE!) -- there's really not a single place in the movie that made it difficult for me to suspend disbelief. Fantastic fun!",8,3,7,21 November 2016
Hero," Beautiful, Beautiful, Beautiful
","It's not often that a film's visual virtuosity has the ability to hit you right between the eyes. I'm still saying 'WOW', and this may go on for days. Every shot is a masterpiece of composition combined with fluid, stylized movements as graceful and technically precise as the strokes of a master calligrapher's brush. And the storyline is faithful to the best of the classical taoist fables. Lao Tzu and Sun Tzu breathe in every frame of this film. I was grateful as well to the film's releasers for not dubbing it into English, which would have destroyed the unity of this grand opus. A gorgeous film, absolutely stunning. If ever I teach AP English classes again, I will most certainly be using this film in my classes as perhaps the penultimate example of how filmmakers use color, composition, music, and movement to reinforce complex metaphorical and philosophical themes. Thank you, whomever talked US movie distributors into putting this into theaters.",Null,8,9,16 September 2004
