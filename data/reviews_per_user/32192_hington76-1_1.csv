The Ring," People need to learn to shut up during the movie!
","I truly hate it when I have to stay in the long line when I'm seeing a movie! When I watched the Ring, In the beginning, this man would not shut up because he was showing his **** talent! However, it was a great movie! Man, I can not wait until this movie comes out on DVD & VHS. When it comes out, I'm buying it,& pre-ordering my copy of the the ring, because people would NOT Shut their mouths! Maybe I should not go to theaters at NIGHT! Maybe I'll go in the afternoon! But It wasnt my fault that it was sold out. Or Maybe Its best for me to wait until The Ring comes out at the $$ Theater, It rarely never solds out! Grade for the ring:9.5/10",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
