Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great action adventure movie
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** A lot of people knock this first installment of Star Wars but I thought it was great. The problem was that people had built this film up over 16 years since Return of the Jedi, and no film could live up to those kind of expectations.From the opening bars of the Star Wars theme I had goose bumps on my neck and for the next two hours it was like being a kid again.The story has been unfairly critcicised for having no plot but I think that the story is quite complicated for what is really a film for children.!PLOT SPOILERS! Also in what other childrens film do you see the main character, the hero all the way through, die. And the main bad guy Darth Sidious 'the Phantom Menace', get away? I think a lot of people who are not Star Wars fans didn't realise that Senator Palpatine is Darth Sidious and the Emperor. Also it was a brave decision by George Lucas to kill off Darth Maul, too often in blockbuster movies the bad guy appears to be dead only to return in some corny and contrived way, but seeing Darth Maul cut in two reinforces that he isn't coming back. Another complaint is that Darth Maul isn't in the film enough but I disagree, the film isn't about him and isn't it better to want more of a character (as with Boba Fett in Empire and Jedi), than to overuse them unnecessarily?The other thing people dislike is the character of Jar Jar Binks and I can understand that he isn't to everyones taste but he is there to lighten up what is essentially quite a dark story and provide humour especially for children.!PLOT SPOILERS! The only problem I can see with The Phantom Menace is that by having Anakin Skywalker be such a good little kid it will be difficult to turn him into Darth Vader in just two films.All in all The Phantom Menace is a fantastic movie, much better than recent blockbusters such as the highly over rated 'The Matrix' and 'The Mummy' It has great characters, cool lightsabers battles, fast spaceships and out of this world costumes, and is a exciting prequel to the other movies.",Null,0,1,2 June 2001
Barry Lyndon," Great film, bad ending
","As others have previously noted about Barry Lyndon, it is incredibly well made (special cameras had to be made to pick up the naturalistic lighting), and the soundtrack is fantastic. Also, although people complain about the running time and acting, I found that both the length and the characters really put you into the 18th Century and every scene in the film is perfectly paced and shot.The only problem I have with it is that after investing time and emotion with Redmond Barry, and seeing him rise and fall through both armies and the class system, was that he doesn't get revenge on Lord Bullingdon,surely the most annoying character ever put on film. I appreciate that the film was about Barry's rise and fall, and a film doesn't have to have a happy ending to be great, but after watching the final duel between Barry and Lord Bullingdon I was disgusted.PLOT SPOILERSDuring the final duel Bullingdon misfires, giving Barry (a seasoned war veteran) the chance to kill him. Barry does not take his chance, thinking obviously that this would make a truce between the two, but Bullingdon again demands his satisfaction and shoots Barry in the leg which leads to amputation.In the previous half hour Barry has lost his 'friends', and his son, and I felt that this final blow could have been tempered if he had managed to have some kind of retribution against Bullingdon.In comparison to other Kubrick movies this is not as good as '2001', or 'Clockwork Orange', but is as good as 'Eyes Wide Shut' and deserves to be more widely viewed.",Null,0,1,14 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Film of the year!
","After seeing the latest Star Wars film, I can't believe just how good it is. I enjoyed The Phantom Menace but didn't think that it was as good as the original trilogy. Attack of the Clones however really is as good parts 4,5 and 6, no matter what some snotty critics may say. I saw it in an (obviously) full cinema and everyone seemed to be impressed by it. The only part that drew a groan from the audience was the appearance of Jar Jar Binks; but that was more than made up for by the amazing action sequences, each one better than the last - the speeder chase on Coruscant, Jango Fett vs.Obi Wan Kenobi(in the rain!),and finally the battle between Jedis, Clone troopers, droids and monsters in a gladiator arena.Added to that was an exciting mystery thriller involving Obi Wan(another great performance from Ewan McGregor after last years fantastic Moulin Rouge), and a well handled and believable love story between Anakin and Padme.This movie also explains how Anakin starts his path toward the dark side which will eventually lead to him becoming Darth Vader, and Hayden Christensen handles the role very well.The best performances however come from Christopher Lee as the evil ex Jedi Count Dooku, and Ian McDiarmid as Supreme Chancellor Palpatine who's understated performance as the master political puppeteer is excellent.Plus if all this doesn't sound good enough we actually get to see Yoda wield a light sabre and prove why he's a Jedi Master!George Lucas is back on top form and the worlds and characters he has created are as entertaining and exciting as ever.See it and enjoy! 10 out of 10!",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
JFK," Gripping conspiracy theory
","This movie is a must see for anyone interested in the cover up behind the Kennedy assassination that rocked the world.Kevin Costner plays Jim Garrison, the Dallas District Attourney, who discovers a link between the events in Dallas and criminals, gangsters and ex CIA agents, and struggles to find the truth even though it may cost him his reputation, family and even his life.This film, although very well directed by Oliver Stone, does suffer from a slightly rose tinted view of Jim Garrison (who was thought to be close to mob bosses), and was critically attacked by critics who thought Stone was excessively paranoid.However the movie outlines the many flaws contained within the Warren report(the official government version of events which confirmed Lee Harvey Oswald as the lone killer), and gives an extremely plausible alternative version of the Kennedy killing.The other reason to see it is for the great cast including performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Joe Pesci and Gary Oldman.For those unfamiliar with the case the film may be slightly complicated, but this proves that Stone will not compromise his vision, simply to dumb down the facts and may a nice cosy thriller, which is very rare for directors these days. The film however only improves with subsequent viewings and for J.F.K. conspiracy theorists (like myself) it is both entertaining and informative, and makes a great companion piece to the director's other masterpiece 'Nixon'.Now all thats needed is for the U.S. Government to release all outstanding CIA files,uncensored of course, and let the world know the truth!(although we all know that will never happen)",Null,0,10,29 May 2002
"Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Anti fascist masterpiece....or pretentious mess?
","Although this film was banned in the u.k. for many years, I recently saw it uncut on t.v.Prior to the film being shown there was a documentary where many people argued that this was a powerful piece of art, as have many people on this site.However after watching it I felt numb and cheated that I had wasted two hours of my life watching Pasolini's 'classic'.The plot is very simple - towards the end of World War II several powerful Italian fascists take prisoner a group of young men and women and torture them, whilst some old prostitutes tell ever more disgusting stories, and err....thats it.Apparently there is some great anti fascist message in showing young (suprisingly compliant) people being tortured; physically,sexually and mentally. That seems to me to be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, everyone knows that fascism is disgusting and that terrible atrocities were commited during World War II, but does that mean to make a voyeuristic movie depicting it is an intelligent thing to do? Especially when it's combined with the sick jail cell fantasies of the Marquis de Sade, and not paticularly well made. The acting is generally poor, and that is combined with some pretty bad camerawork and phoney torture effects. Also it might be set in the '40s but everyone has '70s haircuts!It seems to me that if this movie had been made by an American director then it would still be banned in the U.K., but slap some subtitles on it and you have a deep art house masterpiece.The only reason to see it is that unlike a lot of other previously banned movies that are not that disturbing (for example The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), this film has many genuinely unsettling scenes.I believe that it is right that this movie isn't banned anymore in Britain, but it's difficult to see where it's merits (arstistic or cinematic) lie.",Null,2,3,3 June 2002
