The Avengers," Finally, a movie to unseat The Dark Knight!!
","This movie rocked on so many levels it is hard to know where to begin. From story, to cinematography, to perfect use of CGI, to humour, to music, to stuff blowin' up real good... Avengers proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that Hollywood has NOT forgotten how to make an entertaining movie. As a lifelong Hulk fan, I was blown away by Ruffalo's depiction of Bruce Banner and his big green friend was entirely awesome! Although Hulk/Banner was clearly my favourite, not a single character in this movie felt wasted, underused or overdone. They meshed seamlessly for the tasks at hand after being well introduced to Marvel newcomers over the first 50 minutes or so.Absolutely MUST SEE cinema, on the big screen. Movies like this were why we invented popcorn and IMAX. Not only is it the best superhero movie of all time...it is one of the greatest movies of any genre ever made.",10,2,6,6 May 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Getcha popcorn ready...HULK SMASH!
","I suppose any review about a comic book movie must be preceded by a few disclaimers as to the reviewers objectivity. I've been a Hulk fan for more than 30 years, since I started wearing my first Hulk T-shirt at around age 5. I love the big green guy and all the angst and brooding and power and potential carnage he represents...especially knowing that somewhere deep within that poisoned, rippling, veiny interior is a sensitive soul struggling to stay attached to its compassion and humanity. I really liked Ang Lee's 2003 version but I absolutely LOVED this version! The other disclaimer would be that while I am just as fond of 'thinking' movies like Schindler's List or Flags of our Fathers, I also freely embrace the 'summer blockbuster' and am more than happy to check my brain at the door and munch away on m lapful of over-priced goodies while things blow up real good in front of me.So with that, you already know my opinion of this newest rendition of The Incredible Hulk. The other reviews who have given this movie an 8-10 have pretty much said it all...so I am not going to elaborate on the awesome destruction scenes, the CGI (which I thought was incredibly well done and realistic), the dialogue or what have you. Quite simply I thought it was perhaps the greatest summer smash movie of all time (in a very elite group amongst T2, Jurassic Park, True Lies and Transformers). Stepping away from my Hulk manlove for a moment, and trying to find some objectivity...I can let readers know that the movie is not without some technical flaws which, if you know in advance and can forgive the filmmakers for, it will likely enhance your enjoyment of the overall product. Some attempts to create humour or 'classic memorable lines' in summer blockbusters do not always work, and the Hulk has its share of cheese that made me wince. For example, in trying to pay homage to the classic Bill Bixby TV series, Edward Norton's Bruce Banner (who is very weak in his Portuguese) says to a colleague in Brazil...'Don't make me...hungry...you wouldn't like me when I'm hungry!'. Yes, I admit I laughed, but was secretly miffed at the openly cheap attempt to create humour from a classic line...because the part of my brain that I didn't check at the door realized that 'faminto' and 'zangado' don't sound enough alike that a person uttering a sentence in a newfound language simply wouldn't make that mistake. There were other examples as well of things that appeared to be created for the cheese-factor that simply would not happen in real life (or likely the comic book for that matter). Things like Bronsky saying to the Hulk 'Is that all you got!?' when he wasn't yet quite sure that his body could withstand a massive beating and when any other mortal man would be crapping his pants...or as the Abomination speaking fluent English. Why could a man who only recently became the Abomination talk freely in his native tongue, while Banner has been the Hulk for years and finally took everything he had just to grunt 'HULK SMASH!'? And finally, the scene in the cave with the Hulk and Betty Ross. As a movie maker and a seller of comic books...you've just asked me to suspend all disbelief and accept that a giant green monster can withstand a barrage of 50-caliber shells bouncing off his chest like Nerf balls...but then you want me to believe that when he accidentally bumps his head in a cave it's going to hurt so much that he yells out in pain? Again, I understand the motives behind all this stuff...and it is funny, so the humour can be appreciated...it's just that it becomes 'frying pan in the face' obvious to anybody watching this movie that it tries just a wee bit too hard to be all things to all people. But for 2 hours, it really does succeed in doing that. 9/ 10.",9,5,8,15 June 2008
Spider-Man 2," Does for superhero movies what Rocky did for boxing movies!
","A remarkable achievement, this is not just a great Marvel comic flick it's a great flick period. Even if a person had been living under a rock for the past 30 years and had never heard of Spiderman...they couldn't help but get wrapped up in this touching and courageous story about a societal underdog overcoming his self-stigmatization and learning to believe in himself again...ultimately triumphing in life and love. I absolutely loved the fact that the CGI and fight sequences weren't the sole purpose of the movie...but merely enhanced what was already a splendid tale. Too often we see the reverse of that...where producers, directors and screenplay writers take a few spectacular special effects and try to wrap a mediocre story around it. This is the complete opposite...a story about a human being who happens to be blessed (or cursed) with a gift that he's trying to come to terms with. The fight and flying sequences just complement the story seamlessly. I can't wait for the DVD and will probably be paying for it again at the theater before it ends what is sure to be a long run! 10/10.",10,0,0,30 June 2004
Troy," Spectacular big-screen entertainment but lacking character
","As a fan of movies that utilize the big-screen and digital sound experience to the max...I couldn't help but like this movie.  The sweeping vistas, the epic battles, the sharp treble of iron clanking on iron.  This is why we pay $50 for admission and popcorn these days for a night out at the movies. 
Having said that, it's still nice to see a movie in the theatre that you can walk out and say--'man, that would be just as enjoyable on my 27' Sony at home'. Unfortunately, Troy doesn't quite cut it there.  Eric Bana and Peter O' Toole give fabulous performances as Trojan royalty battling their own wisdom--a fatherwho still believes in help from the Gods and a son firmly grounded in reality. Unfortunately, everyone else -- including Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom -- either suffers from bad acting or a bad script...and we find ourselves not giving a damn whether these primary characters live or die.Troy was much better than I expected, given the marketing idea to cast onlyHollywood's current crop of sexiest leading men, but still falls short of being a classic (such as Return of the King).  Although the story is somewhat grounded in history (the origin of the term Achilles heel, the famous Trojan horse scam), the special effects, costuming and cinematography needed to be complemented by a more enriching story and characters to truly rank amongst the top epicsHollywood we've seen so far.  8/10.",8,1,2,16 May 2004
Scary Movie 2," Haven't you got hair to wash instead?
","Not worth my time to give more than the 4 lines required by IMDB to have my comments registered!  Take away the somewhat funny cursing parakeet, and my rating goes from a 3 to less than zero.  Pure crap; I can't believe this franchise is filming a 3rd installment up in Vancouver as I write.",3,4,8,4 August 2003
Ghost Rider," Good popcorn flick...
","Those who are part of the motorcycle culture will definitely appreciate this movie a lot more...but you don't need to ride to have a good time here.Awesome special effects, a great soundtrack, a few good 'jump out of your seat' startles, and some decent chuckles all contribute to a worthwhile couple of hours for those willing to check their brains at the door and just enjoy the fantasy ride.Don't believe all the critics trashing this one. Go into it knowing full well that Nicolas Cage will over-act like crazy...that many of the lines and scenes will be very cheesy...and that the story will be ridiculous. Armed with those expectations and a bucket of popcorn, you will definitely be more impressed than you thought you would be.",7,3,4,25 February 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," High Plains Drifter: Samurai Style
","What a great movie--Tarantino combines several genres in this masterpiece ofvisceral eye-candy but I wouldn't call it a 'rip off' as so many others have before me.  For visual reference...think 'Sergio Leone directs Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.Uma Thurman is fabulous as the near supernatural 'anti-hero'.  Much likeEastwood's High Plains Drifter...we find ourselves cheering for this woman even though she's just as much of a blood-thirsty cold-hearted bitch as the people she's vowed to gain her vengeance from.  I think all the nay-sayers are confusing documentary and fiction with pureentertainment.  That's what is so classic about Tarantino: he remembers whypeople go to watch films!  A complete escape from reality with a few visually stunning fight scenes and an ending that compels you to rush out and watchVolume 2 as soon as possible.I had but one complaint...and that was a scene early in the movie where TheBride chews the fat small talk style with a Japanese restaurant owner. Scene played out too long and was the only one that bordered on boring. 9/10.",10,0,2,8 June 2004
Big Fish," Alice in Wonderland for grownups
",Wow!  Take a tumble down this rabbit hole and see what Tim Burton's fantasies bring you!  This was a spectacularly told story about a son's quest to find what his father was really all about...only to discover he knew it all along.An extremely moving tale that dares us to dream and reminds us to stop andsmell the roses along the way wherever we go.  A definite classic that hasrightfully been embraced by the movie-watching public and taken its place inthe IMDb 'Top 250' of all time.,9,2,2,16 May 2004
Saw," Best thriller I've seen in a long time!
","In an era when the classic horror movie seems to have gone the way of the dodo bird...along comes 'Saw'. It's tough to extol the virtues of this film without giving away any elaborate plot details...but suffice to say it's so nice to see an intelligent thriller for a change, one that chills us through its diabolical nature and psychological discomforts as opposed to gratuitous gore and 'jump' action sequences.Despite it being ripped by some reviewers for a number of reasons, I didn't think it was that poorly written, casted or acted. The story draws you in to the point where the actors and their lines become secondary anyway.I've long since stopped being scared by monsters, demonic possession, serial killers that border on the ridiculous (i.e. Freddy or Jason)... but I'm still frightened of sociopaths with intelligence and access to the right tools. The main bad guy in this movie, Jigsaw, could easily be walking amongst us in our neighborhoods. Now THAT's scary.Great flick and highly recommended for horror fans. 9/10.",9,0,1,15 February 2005
Mystic River," Clint Eastwood delivers the goods bigtime!
","What a fabulous movie.  Clint Eastwood has become so multi-talented since his days gracing the big screen in a poncho and a stubby cigar...squinting across the plains of central Italy for Sergio Leone.  He even did the musical score in Mystic River!  I can't recall the last time I saw so many Oscar-worthyperformances simultaneous in the same film.  The raw emotion conveyed by allthe principal characters, and right down to the supporting cast, did this well- scripted story justice.  In my view, the only facet of this movie that kept it from 'perfection' was the seemingly unrealistic manner in which the Boston Policeseemed to tolerate the vicious treatment of Sean Penn's character's underworld henchmen.   I found it a bit of a jarring suspension of disbelief in what was otherwise a wonderful story.  9/10.",9,0,0,12 June 2004
X2: X-Men United," Potential for a classic sci-fi but falls just short
","I gave this one an 8, for marvellous special effects and score that complement rather than detract from the movie...and for acting in which all the main players take their characters and related abilities seriously...allowing us to suspend disbelief.  Where it falls just short is in trying to string too many storylines together all at once and never really allowing us to just be absorbed in the drama or adventure...because we're always trying to figure out which stream we're now following.  The downside to this is that if people haven't seen the first movie...they don't really get to know the strife that each of the characters is suffering within themselves and society.  Overall though, an excellent job of putting comic book to big screen with mostly believable action sequences...a few good quips for Wolverine (though not as many as X1, I thought)...and a pretty good story.  Needed just a little bit extra though to match up to Raiders of the Lost Ark or Aliens.",8,0,0,22 December 2003
