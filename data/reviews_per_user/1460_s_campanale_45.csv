Men in Black 3," Men In Black 3 - The Human Adventure
","WARNING! – THIS REVIEW GIVES THE ENDING AWAY! The original 'Men in Black' was a small, quirky comedy that grabbed the public's imagination and became a cultural phenomenon, and like the contemporary 'Austin Powers, international man of mystery', it became a victim of its own success, with its own spin-off series and a sequel that was overstuffed and tried too hard to please. When news came of the 3rd instalment 10 years after the last sequel, it really did seem like a desperate attempt to cash in on a once-vital franchise, especially as it came in 3-D. Stories about script difficulties and production problems lowered expectations even further. The film itself therefore is something of a pleasant surprise, an 'MIB' movie for sure, but one that doesn't just try to dazzle us with the goodies. After all, we've already seen the weird aliens at 'Ellis island' and the freaky creatures disguised as humans thing before all the way through 1 and 2. More of the same would have made it look stale and dull. Instead it does something very brave for a summer tent-pole movie, it tells a very human story. As in MIB2, it is K who is the engine of the plot, with a tragedy in his past the key to resolving a modern crisis. Boris the Animal, well played by the increasingly high profile Jermaine Clement, is the villain, though he exists more as something to be stopped, the enemy who is the catalyst for the tragedy of the piece, so he makes an impression but the film is not about him. Josh Brolin, whose appearance has been the source of much of MIB3s marketing and spin, imitates Tommy Lee Jones brilliantly, but it is never as a gimmick. He is a special effect that allows J to interact with the younger K in 1969, but you soon forget it is an impression, which is exactly as it should be. As in the first 2, there is a race against time and clues to follow along the city, but that standard ticking clock thriller model again takes a back seat to the human story between J and K. The action, while exciting (the wheel- bike chase for example) is quite thinly spread out and any action-fan seeking a mindless shoot-em-up will be disappointed here. Griffin, the 5th dimensional being who can see the many possible futures in the space time continuum is like a mixture between Robin Williams and Dr Manhattan (Michael Stuhlberg does an imitation of the younger Robin Williams that's almost as uncanny as Brolin's take on TLJ) is the '3rd' wheel that is picked up along the way, and becomes the Greek chorus to the unfolding story and its implications. Griffin, unlike the previous 2 '3rd wheels' is a man, and with the exception of Emma Thompson's new boss 'O' (and her perky 1969 version played by Alice Eve) who also doubles as the undisclosed former romantic partner for K, there are no females in any prominent roles and no love interest. The 1969 setting could have been played for cheap nostalgia laughs effect as it was so regrettably in 'Dark Shadows', but apart from a few race jokes and a visit to Andy Warhol's factory, little is made of it, which is a good move as it is the story we care about here not the music or fashions. WARNING- THIS PART TALKS ABOUT THE ENDING The films ending is where the human story plays itself out. The mission is simple enough, put the 'Ark-shield' device in the nose cone of the about-to-take off Apollo 11 so it can protect against the future invasion of Earth, fighting the 2 versions of Boris (1969 and 2012) who are trying to stop them in a battle on the rocket's launch rigging that other critics have already noted for its evident 'Casino Royale' inspiration. But though it is a satisfactory action ending, it is really just the stage on which the stories true focus plays out. The film has wisely been building up a sense of dread, of impending tragedy culminating at the launch, and helplessly we wait to watch this dark fate play out. That tragedy turns out to be of an almost '12 Monkeys' nature, as J, who remains a passive witness from afar, observes his father, an army colonel in charge of launch defence, sacrifice himself to save K from the vengeful Boris, making K swear to look after his son, who at that moment is a 5 year old J waiting in the car. K neutralises him, removing all memory of the tragedy, but also of his father, and promises to look out for him, so intertwining their fates forever. It is a moment played out with gravitas and pathos, the face of the future explained by looking to a moment in the past, and the relationship between K and J that has been the engine of the entire franchise now suddenly revealed in its true nature for the first time. Back in 2012, we see that K has never really changed from that bright cheerful 1969 version, that his trademark cragginess and surliness around J is the price of knowing the terrible price paid for his life, the awful secret he was carrying with him all these years. The film ends in a wonderful moment of catharsis as for the first time they truly know each other, and a new future promised for a 15 year old partnership. For a film that looked like a desperate attempt to ring some box office, it instead becomes the ultimate prequel, and a moving human story. Let us hope it does not pay the price at the box office for it",9,1,3,27 May 2012
Captain Phillips," Movie Piracy - Greengrass gives us a tense thrilling true life tale of aquatic action, courageous captains and human hearts
","Like it's contemporary 'Rush', this film turns real life headline events into a powerful film that both chronicles events more incredible than mere fiction could create, and also (more importantly) makes for a fully satisfying cinematic experience.Based on the true-life book written about the incident, it tells the story of the 2009 journey of the freighter Maersk Alabama and it's captain Richard Phillips (Played here by Tom Hanks) who ran into trouble with the then very active Somali pirate gangs off the East African coast en route to deliver aid to Kenya. A small but determined band of pirates, led by Muse (played by newcomer Barkhad Abdi) takes over the ship, hoping to ransom it off for millions with the insurance companies, but the ships Wiley crew managed to outsmart them and make an occupation impossible. Forced to escape in the Alabama's motorized life-boat, they take the contents of the ships safe ($30,000) and Phillips as a hostage, hoping to take him back to Somalia for ransom. With the US navy taskforce alerted, a dangerous game of cat and mouse ensues both between the Navy and the pirates and between the pirates themselves, divided between the reasonable Muse, the dangerous, violent hothead Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) the worried Najee (Faysal Ahmed) and the scared new boy kid of the group Elmi (Mahat Ali) with whom Phillips forms a particularly paternal bond. As the Navy closes in with orders to stop them one way or another, the tensions rise to beyond boiling point as Phillips tries to play the disparate band off against each other from within the boat itself.The film is directed by Paul Greengrass, the documentary maker who became a sensation with the 'Bourne' series, introducing to the cinema world the now often imitated, over (and inappropriately) used and clichéd elements of 'Greengrass verite', such as shaky cam, focus pulls, circling around, dramatic cutting between players in a situation around the world, etc. As with his previous ripped from the headlines drama 'United 93' Greengrass' style serves the real life dramatic events well, putting us right into the action, presenting it dispassionately yet not coldly, leaving Hollywood mores and narrative tropes at home as he just tells it like it is and lets the events speak for themselves.The film's structure is as you would imagine it to be. It starts off by introducing our two key players, Phillips and Muse, with a basic knowledge of their motivations and characteristics. Phillips is shown to be a loving family man (with cameoing Catherine Keener as his wife) yet aware of the increasingly difficult dog eat dog world his children will inherit. Muse on the other hand is shown as an ambitious man, full of bravado and self-confidence, yet also very much small fry in the criminal underworld he inhabits, with a boss demanding targets and empty coffers. We then follow the Alabama and the pirate ship as they cross paths. The action starts 20 minutes in as Muse's band relentlessly follow the Alabama despite its superior speed and height with a cat and mouse game that sees the pirates get a foothold. Then it is another game of cat & mouse aboard as the crewmen hide and use their superior knowledge of the ship to cripple it and lay traps for the pirates, injuring Elmi and capturing Muse. Everything seems to end with their defeat and escape by lifeboat, but the desperate Muse, who cannot bear the shame and loss of going home empty handed, takes Phillips hostage and so begins the final cat and mouse, between Navy and pirates, and between Phillips & pirates. The action here cuts frantically between the Navy warships, SEAL commandos and the smaller battle inside the boat, as Phillips tries to use reason to make them see the error of their actions, until the final confrontation and Phillip's release. Greengrass really makes you feel the tension, with a ticking clock almost audible beneath; gripping you to your seat as you wait to see how the events we know happened will unfold anyway, all aided by a brilliant score by Henry Jackman.The film is neutral, without real heroes or villains (save perhaps Bilal the heavy) dramatically correct in showing us both sides of this story while at the same time not glamourizing nor condoning the pirates (though we see they are just trying to make a buck like everyone else) and makes us sympathise with them a little, even though their own arrogance, naivety, over-confidence and stupid decision making are the ultimate causes of their own doom. Also we see they are just infantry, lorded over by the big warlords and bosses who send men to fight while keeping most of the loot themselves, betrayed and abandoned when things go wrong.The acting is similarly muted and unshowy, yet effective. Hanks as the title character is typically Hanksian, a strong, solid man, humble yet intelligent, dedicated to job & family, dealing with life's difficulties with good old quiet American pluck. On his crew are numerous familiar character actors, including Corey Johnson, David Warshofsky & Michael Chernus, all good. The pirates, all played by Somali emigrees, are also well played, denoting their characters well and making us both fear, loath, and sympathise with them, especially Abdi as Muse, who throughout is portrayed as Phillip's mirror image, two similar men on opposite sides (a familiar narrative idea) The Navy team is also solid, led by Yul Vazquez & Max Martini (of 'Pacific Rim') among others. An excellent, gripping, tense thriller, true life story and tale of human courage and resolve under incredible circumstances, it will make for a memorable night at the cinema and further proof of the original Greengrass at work.",9,4,8,14 October 2013
Sucker Punch," Original and Bold but maybe not what audiences wanted
","Many have proffered their own interpretations, and this is just my own.As many have said, I believe the film is all a fantasy taking place in 'Sweet Peas' head, a cathartic fantasy designed to help her expunge her demons and overcome her psychological problems, perhaps with the aid of a counsellor/therapist (The Carla Gugino character?) What these 'traumas' may be is unclear, but they probably involve sexual violence and or/guilt, and the accidental death/harm of a younger sister, since this same act occurs twice in the movie, both in romanticised 'dying to protect from harm' scenarios. Her desire to return home though may mean that the violence of the films many stereotyped sexual predators may be external to the family unit (Date rape?) Many seem to take it for granted that the '50s Asylum' level of reality is the ultimate 'reality', but I suggest that it too is just another fantasy level – being just as much a caricatured surreal demi-world as the Burlesque theatre or the WWI battlefields – which explains why so many things that happen there don't make sense. I believe that, as with some interpretations of INCEPTION, the whole thing is being concocted in some other layer of reality which we never get to see. Also people complain that aside from Sweet Pea and her sister Rocket, none of the other characters are fleshed out or real, which would support this interpretation since Sweet Pea is her own avatar, while her sister (idealised version?) is made from many genuine memories of a real person, whereas the others are just shades, faces from a crowd given a generic role to play. All of the girls (bar Rocket) are elements of Sweet Peas own personality, actresses in her cathartic experience. Each has a role to play, and it was interesting for example that in each fantasy, 'Amber' is the pilot, a role usually evoking control, but not much was made of it.'Baby Doll' who is erroneously introduced to us as the heroine (Which she is, even though she does not exist!) is Sweet Peas own personal guardian angel (as per the narratives). As many have said, she seems to have almost no character, no lines, no expressions and looks oddly like a doll. I believe that she may actually very well be just that – A Doll! Perhaps a beloved childhood companion, someone to protect and to give comfort during the dark times, a mouthpiece for her own desires and wants (her role here..) and someone would could be put into danger (as dolls often are) as she is here. She is a safety valve to at once remove Sweet Pea from her own perils and anxieties, now given full human form to become once again Sweet Peas 'other voice' and the heroine of her adventure, her saviour. Her symbolic 'death' at the end, rather than the expected rescue and revenge, may also represent the death of childhood and innocence, and the Sweet Peas acceptance of her role as an adult (and her return to her milieu as an adult) This fantasy world created by Snyder is, to his credit, an authentically adolescent one, a credible window into a how a teenager would see the world, and a modern one at that. Her fantasies are actually rather mundane and pedestrian (another popular complaint) and also all second hand and acquired. The World War 1 sequence is exactly how a teenager might imagine the war, all Zeppelins and Fokker Triplanes, with a 'good vs evil' idea of the conflict that makes the Germans into literal monsters (rather like the imagined Persians in 300) The Samurai scene and the girls uniforms are all borrowed from Manga, the dragon scene is unashamedly the result of someone who has been excitedly reading/watching 'THE LORD OF THE RINGS', and the final scene of ticking bombs and evil robots another movie/computer game take, also a way of reliving her sister tragedy within generically comfortable boundaries. Even the Asylum and the Burlesque are what someone who had been watching the odd old movie might imagine those worlds to be like, with their stock baddies, bad doctors and Zoot Suit gangsters. Sex is also a central theme here, the fear of sex (sexual predators), the power of her own burgeoning sexuality (the dances) and the threat/possible experience of sexual violence. The twin threats her Baby Doll avatar faces, deflowering and Lobotomisation, are both distinctly phallic threats involving forced penetration, again mirroring a fear of sex (That her Baby Doll actually is lobotomised and seemingly invites it would again suggest acceptance of sex) The Glenn wise man is a clear mythopoetic 'guide' and may be either a kindly uncle or teacher, or perhaps even her own father. The finale, still a fantasy, shows her accepting her return home as a fully formed young woman, having overcome her fears and doubts and possible terrible experiences, with the most oft used metaphor, the bus (driven by her protecting father figure)/ That's my take on it anyway. It may be right, part right, or totally wrong, but I guess Snyder wants us each to have our own 'correct' personal interpretation of it, hence the ambiguity. That the film is initially proving a box office and critical bomb is unsurprising, and will probably spend a few years in the wilderness before being 're-evaluated' as all greats are. Alas this film is being currently sold as an action packed Saturday day adventure, when it's really a dark, somewhat joyless journey through a tormented teenagers angst, and audiences are perhaps rightly feeling cheated",7,4,7,2 April 2011
Skyfall," Skyfall: A Different type of Bond.
","This is a first impression review from a lifelong Bond fan just back from an early morning screening in London.'Skyfall' is the Bond that nearly didn't happen, so that it's here at all makes it welcome. It's quite long, but it never drags or bores in the way that perhaps 'Casino Royale' did. Like 'Quantum of Solace' it actually feels like a Bondfilm despite its many flaws, and invites multiple viewings. It's much publicised budget limitations show, with most of the film shot in the centre of London (fun for Londoners like me who see many familiar spots become Bond backdrops) including 007s first foray into our famous 'Tube' train network, and a finale in Scotland. Turkey(popular location for modest actioners – see 'Taken 2') and Singapore/Macau make fleeting appearances, though it's hard to say if Craig actually ever went there, since it's just postcard vistas followed by obvious studio sets. The film promised to strip Bond to the emotional core, something that has been boasted since 'Casino Royale', but frankly we learn as much here about Bond's tragic childhood as we did about Peter Parker in this summer's 'Amazing Spiderman' (ie almost nothing) He is supposed to see 'M' as a surrogate mother, but it's something that must be read since it's never actually implied in any way. Romance and the 'Bond girls' get relegated to a level that makes 'Quantum' look like 'Twilight', and will worry those who see Eros getting squeezed out of the Bond world altogether! In the case of Naomie Harris, this lack of sex makes sense with the final reveal, but a romantic interlude is briefly shared with Severine, though Berenice Marlohe looks and acts very much like Talisa Soto's Lupe in 'Licence to Kill', a character whose arc she shares and who may be one of the many nods to Bond's legacy scattered throughout. Unlike recent Bond outings, who have featured less than memorable adversaries, this one baited us with a strong villain in the shape of the legendary Javier Bardem, who cleverly subverts his Latino hunk image playing a flouncy camp gay baddie. Unfortunately his character is never developed, and has actually very little screen time, which disappoints. He spars verbally with Bond, but despite being of similar age and physique, there is no hand to hand combat between the two. He doesn't really care about 007 anyway, it's 'M' he's after. That is his only motivation (he is a cyber-terrorist, but he makes out it's just a hobby and nothing special) and all for a hazy, poorly explained back story during the 1997 Hong Kong handover. In fact he seems to be an amalgam of the villains in the 2 McG 'Charlie's Angels' films, a cyber whizz kid who engineers an incredibly complex web of events just to get at an intelligence boss who once betrayed him in morally dubious circumstances and a former top operative who went rogue after capture and torture soured their souls. Whether this is accidental or deliberate only the screenwriters can know? He also has hideous scarring which a prosthetic hides, easily removable for a 'look what you did to me!' moment, then forgotten about. The action is fun, but oddly unoriginal. Again the 'car chase' occurs in the pre-credits sequence, then we get a dirt-bike chase through a crowded 3rd world marketplace and a fight atop a moving train, two things we've seen many times before. We also have a brief fight that's filmed in silhouette, which looks sillier than it sounds. There's a foot-chase-manhunt on the underground, again something that's been in dozens of films (interrupted by a train falling through the roof, something that looks cool in the trailer but means nothing in the film) and a final battle in Bond's ancestral Scottish home which is clearly inspired by the final cottage fight of 'Straw Dogs' (except that was more violent and exciting!) It's all watchable, but oddly familiar and unoriginal, something 007 action should never be! The score by Mendes regular Thomas Newman is OK, but sounds like a bad impersonation of regular David Arnold, and is not up to the usual 007 music standard. The title sequence accompanying Adele's deliberately Bassey-esque song is lovely, teasing us with images, locales and elements of the film we are about to watch. The cinematography by Roger Deakins is also very good, and makes a modest film look glamorous and lush.Elements from previous Bonds are scattered throughout in a way similar to 40th anniversary 'Die Another Day', including the classic Aston Martin from 'Goldfinger'. It also has the least ambitious Villain ever, least exotic locales, least sex, and furthermore the script tries to hide the fact that under the accolades and backslapping, 007 actually achieves precisely nothing in this story!The overall theme seems to be 'Bond is still as relevant today as he was 50 years ago', and it is constantly hammered home with little subtlety throughout, with an 'analogue Vs. digital' set up similar to this summer's 'Battleship'. The film ends with the traditional 007 set up restored, albeit with some changes. There's a condescending 'Q', a flirty Miss Moneypenny at her desk (guess who she was during the rest of the movie?) and a Bernard Lee style 'M' in a drawing room office handing Bond secret mission files. In other words, we've reconstructed Bond, now we're going back to the beginning again because tradition is what it's all about! Quite how much of this will make into the next Bond when there ISN'T a 50th anniversary to celebrate remains to be seen?But it's a Bond, and it's here, and its good and fun, so let's celebrate that at least!",8,8,20,26 October 2012
Iron Man 3," A BLACK day for Marvel - Shane stamps his signature on Stark's swansong for a pulp thriller that's less spectacular but more comical
","Awash with excitement, we went to the special Midnight premiere last night at our local Cineworld multiplex in the company of all the other geeks and comic book freaks, not knowing quite what we were going to get. What we did get was unusual and surprising.'Iron Man', despite his fame within the Marvel comics' universe, was almost unknown in the mainstream before 2008, yet now he is among the most famous superheroes in the world, and associated with the resurgent Robert Downey Jr in the same way 007 WAS Sean Connery. Though he shined in 'The Avengers', his own standalone films have been more about Tony Stark than Iron Man in the same way the Nolan Batmans and Raimi Spidermans were about Bruce Wayne and Peter Parker, and this, the final part of the trilogy, is if anything even MORE so.The defining factor of this episode is its director, king of cool violent thrillers Shane Black, the man who gave us 'Lethal Weapon' 'Die Hard' 'Long Kiss Goodnight' 'The Last Boy Scout' as well as Downey Jr's own 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. Not since Ang Lee's ill-fated 'Hulk' in 2003 has a director so stamped his personal seal on a Marvel project. This is a Shane Black adventure starring Tony Stark who occasionally becomes Iron Man and sometimes fights some people with the power of lava but mainly cracks wise and solves highly convoluted multi-party conspiracies and plots during Christmas. It is a very well made Shane Black adventure (better than KKBB anyway) and has all the requisite factors – Cool dialogue, complex plot, clever villains pulling all the strings, crooks masquerading as political terrorists to hide their real motives, torture, buddy comedy, more torture, Christmas, background roles for the women and a massive shootout in a container port at night. Downey Jr plays it beautifully and owns the film, which means everyone else just gets crumbs. This includes returning Don Cheadle as Rhodes, now flying the USAs own 'Iron Patriot', who unlike 'IM2' is largely side-lined in both role and action. Even Pepper Potts, Gwyneth Paltrow's own ticket to box office reinvention, is not so central now that their on-off love affair has become official. Her role is to get kidnapped and held hostage (how original!) but she is occasionally given moments to shine, such as operating the Iron Man suit a couple of times in battle and becoming a sort of super-powered heroine herself by the end (Flame girl?) Yet compared to 1-2, she is marginal, rather as she was in 'The Avengers'. Former director Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan, now head of security, and steals every scene until a bomb blast puts him in a convenient coma for 2/3 of the film.The villains are a murky bunch, classic Marvel adversaries reinvented in Black-ian terms, none more so than 'The Mandarin' (Ben Kingsley) IMs number 1 enemy and the one all fans have been waiting for. He is definitely NOT the same character in the comics, recreated as a literal Bin-Laden terrorist mastermind punishing America's sins and issuing chilling taunting videos to the Great Satan. His famous 10 rings (not magical here) were already used as the basis for the Al-Qaeda stand-ins of the first film, and here he seems to be their actual leader. To say too much would be to spoil it, but he turns out to be based on a lot of conspiracy theories about the late Bin Laden, and will likely antagonise some Marvel fans. His co-villain is another IM favourite, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) alongside Maya Hansen (Rebecca Hall), both brilliant and originally well-meaning scientists who get the cold shoulder from a pre-redemption Stark at a funny 1999 New Year's eve party intro in Berne (Yinsen was indeed there as he said in part 1) and become both bitter and successful enough in the intervening years to make life hard for him now. As in the comics, they have formulated 'Exxis', a regenerative healing property that can also turn their subjects into fiery mutants or worse kill them. The 'regenerative miracle drug becomes accidental super weapon' idea is used so much better here than it was in the lame Lizard of last years 'Amazing Spiderman', and also creates the private army of super powered war veterans that make like tough for Tony, especially head henchman Savin (James Badge Dale) They are the only other sci-fi fantasy element in this film, and seem oddly out of tune with this otherwise straight thriller.Action scenes are sparse but interesting, none more so than the helicopter attack that destroys Starks plush cliff-side palace (more massacre than battle) and the rescue of falling passengers from Air Force 1, both featured heavily in the trailers, as is the final container port battle featuring a fleet of radio-controlled suits based on previous versions taking on the Exxis army, but it is an oddly uninspiring affair. There are also some shoot-outs and alley fights in more traditional Black tradition.Running themes include Tony's existential angst over the supernatural events of 'The Avengers' that blew his comfortable preconceptions away and a sense that HE is becoming the suit rather than vice versa, with the fully formed IM often seeming alive, a friend he sits down and talks to. The ending suggests closure for the current Iron Man series, though in Bond-ian style the credits promise 'Tony Stark WILL return'. Also look out of the obligatory after credits scene featuring Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner that puts the whole movie into an interesting new perspective.It is not the most fantastic superhero film ever, but it is a bold and left-field end to a trilogy, stronger than IM2 and an enjoyable experience, especially for Downey Jr and Shane Black fans.",9,9,21,25 April 2013
World War Z," The Losses are incalculable....and that's just the investors talking! A Dead movie project comes back as a mindless but still quite swift Zombie!
","The story behind the making of 'world war Z' is of course more fascinating than the film itself. A best selling cult book that took real world geo-politics, military planning, history and personal experience then threw in zombies way before the cast of Sense and Sensibility or Abraham Lincoln were fighting them, a bidding war between star players and high hopes. Then the script re-writes, the production delays, the film losing all sense of shape and direction as it is passed from hand to hand, a reputation as a bad joke growing, all satirical and political aspects that made the book so popular trimmed away layer by layer till all we were left with was just another Frakking Zombie movie! Then a disastrous premiere in London and lukewarm critical reception leading to this.With films such as this, one has to be more understanding, aware that what we are seeing is the salvaged remains of a greater idea rather than a complete piece of work, a fire damaged good up for cheap sale. So do not go in expecting something spectacular or magnificent.As an international thriller it works OK, and Brad Pitt is as good a central figure as any other leading man. There are plenty of Zombies and plenty of action, and Marco Beltrami's score hits all the right notes.The main problems (for us anyway) are: (1) The structure. We start off with Brad and his all-American (actually half English) family enjoying their all-American family life when suddenly they are caught up in stock 'sudden city-wide panic and chaos' and flee from crashing cars into supermarket chaos then into a high rise for some 'Raid/Dredd' corridors of despair hide and seek then 'chased by hoard onto roof and jumping onto helicopter just as hoard reach them, trying to grab onto the landing gear' before they reach 'ultra professional cool under fire military centre' (this time in a ship) Then Pitt, an ex top UN investigator, is forcibly re-instated and goes off on a 'quest for the source of the outbreak'. What follows is basically the same silly premise repeated four times. He arrives in South Korea, gets a little bit of info, then Zombies break loose and kill everyone he was helping. Then he arrives in Isreal and gets a little bit of info, then Zombies break loose and kill everyone he was helping. Then they get on the first airliner out of Tel Aviv and finds a little bit of info then Zombies break loose and kill everyone on board, then they arrive at World Health Organization centre in Wales where Zombies have broken loose and killed everyone, and then he arrives at the answer to the viruses spread, and finds the solution. All the problems of a post-Zombie world. the whole point of the original book, are lightly brushed over with a Muse soundtracked cosy coda. It is repetitive, especially the second and third acts, which are the same thing repeated. (2) Unoriginality. As per above precis, everything here is stock and by the book, Nothing new or fresh at all in a genre that is virtually burned out. Even the Zombies and the scenes they are in are identical to those in any of the 'Resident Evil' films. You sit there constantly waiting for Mila Jovovich to burst in all guns blazing doing her high kick moves, or at the very least a boss monster/licker to leap out. As a result the film feels too samey. (3) Silliness. Whilst clearly not the original intention, the end result looks silly and often plays like a Hannah Barbera Saturday morning cartoon. Everything that can go wrong goes wrong every single time, and Pitts brilliant solutions (blow up an airplane in mid air? On the spot amputations on a hunch?) come from nowhere and are ALWAYS proved right! This is not helped by the seriousness and stiff lipped manner everything occurs, which only adds to an unfortunate air of camp and silliness. The book was written by Max Brooks, but at times the film seems more inspired by his father Mel!Acting wise everyone is good, Pitt is fine, if not exactly super emotional. Mireille Enos as Pitt's wife and Daniella Kertesz as the Israeli woman soldier who becomes his sidekick are good, as are James Badge Dale as the commander of the South Korean outpost, and Peter Capaldi and Pierfrancesco Pavini are solid as the WHO doctors in the final segment. Fana Mokoeana appears as his old UN boss and handler while Ludi Boeken makes for a suitably philosophical Mossad boss in the Tel Aviv scenes.Special effects are mostly OK, but are often weak and rushed (plane crash-jerky zombies) Scotland and Glasgow pass for Wales and Philadelphia while Malta passes for South Korea and Israel (not too badly actually). Budapest PASSED for Moscow till all those scenes were cut to avoid making it 'too political' (Ha!) Like previous disaster stricken projects such as 'The Invasion' and 'The Island of Dr Moreau' there is a kind of flatness, a weakness and lack of drive, a sense of cracks papered over and corners held together with duct tape just enough to be able to sell it off cheap and make what little can be made on the lost investment. As cruel as it is, we actually enjoyed it more as a sort of unintentional comedy 'MSTK3000' style than as a serious sci-fi horror thriller, for which it is highly entertaining. So if nothing else, you can enjoy it as a sort of comedy, preferably at a midnight show with friends after a few beers!It isn't a summer blockbuster, and it isn't a film version of 'World War Z', but there is far worse out there, and a with a little charity for it's hard life it is actually quite a good night at the cinema,",7,1,10,22 June 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Galaxy Quest II - The Wrath of Fans
","I am a life-long Star Trek fan. Not a 'Trekkie', but someone who grew up with the series and later the films, both of which left a definite mark on me into maturity. The original I loved because it had wonderful characters played by wonderful actors, and clever, inventive worlds and possibilities, as well as often spine chilling horror (to a 7 yr old at least!) which still occasionally appears in my nightmares, but most of all I loved it because what was beneath all that. The use of Sci-fi to do what Swift and Voltaire, Wells and Verne, Bradbury and Clarke used it for – A Mirror to our own world in which to ask questions about ourselves and offer answers which were not always pleasant to hear. Here choices were hard, nothing was black and white and decisions and actions had tragic and emotionally crushing consequences. I remember being so moved by the series that even today I feel a lump in my throat and even a tear in the eye whenever I hear the famous theme tune that played out the latest emotionally exhausting Star Trek into Darkness once a week.Everything must change of course, but recently we have been getting reboots which are praised as being 'brilliant reinventions' but which are simple substitutions using established names and situations to tell pretty generic stories deprived of everything that made the originals so special. Now James Bond has become a dull manic depressive engaged in boring battles against feeble opponents and his own demons, Doctor Who has become a 45 minute parade of laser blasts and half-baked PC nonsense, and Star Trek has become a wham-bam-thank you mam testosterone filled shoot-em-up deprived of even the minimum vestige of its former self.2009's 'Star Trek' signalled the start of the 'reinvention' which paved the way for the new style, and in its wake there was much speculation on what the sequel would contain. 'Wrath of Khan', number II of the original series, was used as some sort of bar on which to judge its modern counterpart. Abrams and Lindof must have been listening because they've basically fashioned their own version of the story here, knowing of course that it would be judged against the original as a result.Everyone will have to make their own mind up. Being a passionate lover of 'ST2WOK' for a variety of reasons, many personal, I found the retake not just inferior but insulting, especially since this was 'canon', and also cheap and unoriginal. Blowing your nose (not to mention any other bodily function) on a masterpiece doesn't improve it not make you a creative genius.The story (spoilers) happens in the 'alternate universe' of movie 1, and here Noonan Singh Khan, Indian warlord and genetically engineered superman/war criminal from 21st century Earth and his crew are picked up years earlier by militant Starfleet Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) who wants to use Khans military mind-set to prepare a militarised arm of Star Fleet to fend off the growing Klingon threat, only for it to backfire in his face when Khan shows his true colours. Interestingly, that colour is white, since the Indian Khan, formerly played as an Indian in the usual Latin-Desi racial pass by Mexican Ricardo Montalban, is still Indian but now played by the ultra-white Anglo Brit actor Benedict Cumberbatch. How and why is never explained. Dr Carol Marcus (Here Alice Eve), Kirk's great love and future mother of his estranged son David, is here a sexy bob haired cheerleader who strips to her underwear for the sake of publicity since it's in every trailer and advert.Khan starts out as villain, then becomes a sort of ally as Admiral Marcus suddenly becomes Dick Dastardly for the unforgivable sin of trying to make Star Fleet a credible defence against the Klingon threat (Anti-militarism is so cool you know, as well as so 2003) then Marcus becomes a goody and Khan becomes a villain again. Then there's the most idiotic thing ever, which is that Kirk virtually replays Spock's sacrifice in ST2 point for point, seemingly without irony, concluding with the mirror-imaged Radiation door scene and Spock shouting 'Khhhaaaaaan!' into the air (Oh that is SO clever and deconstructionist!) Both ships crash into San Francisco, probably killing thousands of unacknowledged extras, followed by the new most idiotic thing ever, Rambo Spock and Khan having an endless beat down on, appropriately enough, flying garbage trucks until the inevitable happy ending occurs as ST3's rejuvenating planet gets condensed into something else that cures death. Of course when ST2 came out, NOBODY knew there was going to be a ST3 – That was the end of Spock and that's what made it so powerful. Here we know the series doesn't end this way, so it is all smoke and mirrors with an appropriate lack of stakes or real emotion. Everything stops and starts again every 35-40 minutes like most other Abrams works (MI3 and Super 8 come to mind)fashioning a loose patchwork rather than an cohesive single narrative.The opening is also quite goofy, with The Enterprise underwater (?) and a bid to stop a planet from being destroyed by its active Volcano, which leads to twin themes of Kirk defying the rules (The Kobiashi Maru mindset) and of self-sacrifice, both, like the rest of the movie, nosing back to ST2.The special effects are good, as are the designs and the 3D. Acting is OK, with everyone doing a passable imitation of the originals save Pine, who is still playing Kirk as a wild cowboy douche.Exciting and interesting enough on its own, it nonetheless grievously disrespects the original, which it blatantly hijacks for its own ends. How you will feel about this depends on how you felt about the original film and indeed the original Rodenberry incarnation.",6,9,23,13 May 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Part retro adventure Part action template circa 2001
","As soon as I saw the casting and the general vibe of the movie in production I sussed it would, at best, be a throwback to the 'Sinbad/Arabian Adventure' style movies of the 1970s (of which I have very happy memories of rushing to see at my local flea pit as a child!) Seeing the movie last night that's exactly what we got with A) An American actor in lead wearing wig and dark make up B) The most English actress in England as exotic beauty also wearing wig and dark make up C) Very established serious character actor with vaguely foreign look hired as evil villain D) A sinister tall henchman in black who says very little to do all the dirty work E) Cheap cardboard looking generic Arab city sets filled with very few extras milling around F) Some tasty location work in Morrocco doubling for wherever it was meant to be G) Couple fall instantly in love after 2 seconds H) Rubbishy generic 'What Westerners think Middle Eastern music sounds like' soundtrack I) Poorly defined quest plot centring on magical macguffin device J) Robust comic relief dirty brigand character with his easy to make laugh gang of smelly ruffians who start out evil but end up good K) Everyone speaks in English accents of varying types (Acceptable since the alternative of doing it all in funny fake Middle Eastern accents is worse - see 'Golden Voyage of Sinbad') So I was pleasantly happy that my meagre expectations of this film were fulfilled, at least for the first hour and 10 minutes or so, when the movie turns very suddenly and very violently into some generic fantasy actioner from 2000-2002 with all the drop off that entails. Not only 'The Mummy' and it's wonderful sequel, but also 'Tomb Raider' (With VERY similar time travel turn around previous tragedy and battle result) 'Bulletproof Monk' and many others, not to mention the Russian 'Daywatch' (Again similar 'Wipe out previous disaster with magic time travel artifact' end) and even Jet Li's 'The One'. So we have a diverting little cut and paste movie capturing somewhat jarringly two separate stages in fantasy movie history. Of course as many have said there is not one single original molecule in the entire film, but then when was the last time we actually saw ANYTHING original in our cinemas, especially in summer? Dumb but fun and instantly forgettable, that is perhaps what fantasy cinema of this type is all about, so in that sense it is a triumph.",6,3,10,25 May 2010
Fast & Furious 6," Its Fast and Furious 006...but its 007 they're aiming for!
","We here in London are getting it a week early as a present for it being shot here.The 'Fast and Furious' is one of those surprisingly long lasting pulp B- series that alongside 'Underworld' 'Resident Evil', 'Mission Impossible' and 'Scary Movie' are now into their second decade and umpteempth instalment. All of those have become family cottage industries for the reoccurring cast and crew, rather like the greatest long runner of them all James Bond, and it is a good advertisement for what this kind of 'house' production style can achieve as opposed to the more cynical quick cash grab approach taken by bottom line studios and their disinterested hacks.When the first 'FF' came out in 2001 it was an intimate family-crime drama based around the then unknown Street Racing scene, with a couple of chases and races but mainly stayed on 2 legs. A dull sequel came in 2004 then a totally separate story strand in 2006 which nonetheless showed the technical competence of director Justin Lin and writer Chris Morgan, who became entrusted by the returning original cast (whose expected great careers had never really materialised!) with the transformation of the series into a sort of 'Avengers' or 'Mission Impossible' on wheels, a team of recurring characters who take on the big crime bosses street racer way. In that form we now have the 6th movie and 3rd 're-launch' instalment.The trailers tell you pretty much the whole story & there is little to spoil here. Agent Hobbes (Dwayne Johnson) comes knocking to the team's door with the promise of pardons if they help bring down a crew of dangerous ex-British and Russian special forces operatives headed by Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) with the added enticement of the presumed dead Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) alive and well and running with them. Seems she did not die in 'Fast N'Furious' but merely lost her memory in a classic case of plot convenient amnesia and was reshaped by Shaw, who was working with FNF's Mexican drug cartel villain Campos at the time, into his number 1 deadly driver girl. So the crew ups and moves to London where Shaw and co are stealing components for a deadly 'Goldeneye' style EMP bomb that they will sell to the highest bidder or else! Cue chases and fist fights in Mayfair, Canary Wharf, Kings Cross, Piccadilly, Camden, Waterloo, and Battersea, even down the Underground, all great fun for Londoners like us after 'Skyfall', and a nice touch of exotic foreignness for World audiences. The third act takes place in Spain, where a deadly battle on the suspended motorways of Las Canarias against a hijacked Tank gives way to a final showdown on and around a Russian Antonov transport plane attempting take off. This unashamedly 007-esque climax appropriately tops off what is really a Spy adventure with the team working with the intelligence services to stop an evil villain and his high-tech scheme, making it different from the previous instalment (Oceans 11 in Rio) and the one before that (Revenge in Mexico). Same beats different set up – The key to a good franchise!The film has several big action set pieces, starting with chase between the team in black BMWs trying vainly to capture Shaw and co in London, followed by a gun battle in Elephant & Castle and a nasty girl fight between the 2 toughest chicks around, Michelle Rodriguez and Gina Carano,(making good on Soderbergh's gamble to launch her as an action star) in the confined corridors of the Tube station. The Street racing roots are acknowledged with a car show-street race between Dom and Letty from Green Park through Piccadilly Circus to Battersea power station, then the Las Canarias tank-car battle, and eventually the airport- Antonov climax. All are slick and exciting, at least for those who enjoy exotic cars going fast.The cast of returnees are all excellent, though some show fatigue, mainly Sung Kang's Han and Gal Gadot's Giselle, supposedly lovers but obviously not of this franchise anymore! Jordana Brewster's Mia has her baby and promptly misses out on most of the rest of the movie, as does previous love interest Brazilian cop Elena (Elsa Pataky) who becomes the spare wheel once Letty turns up (She is very noble and dignified about it of course). Evans is hardly tough guy material, but is actually surprisingly convincing as a cold blooded SAS hard man, reminiscent of Robert Shaw's Brit mercenary in 'Taking of Pelham 123', while his crew is composed of generic stereotypes like evil Asian dude, big heavy Russian, cute blonde but vicious Russian girl, evil bald guy, evil bald black guy and evil handsome black guy. Carano does well in a supporting role, not having to carry a movie as she bravely attempted in last year's 'Haywire', and her muscular brawn sets her well apart from the other supposedly tough chicks. Even Rodriguez is outmatched by a woman twice her size, but uses dirty tricks to even the odds in their various encounters.This instalment is good dirty fun, and delivers what its inspiration, the 007 series, used to before they decided that it was all somehow beneath them (good luck on the future there guys!) The ending returns to the series roots, with the Toretto's Italian-American family values at play in a round table barbecue, but of course it won't end there, not yet at least.The ending, which retcons 'Tokyo Drift' (which finally happens in this continuity) sees the arrival of a new adversary for episode 7 – The Transporter!Roll on Fast and Furious 7 – And along with Mission Impossible take 007's mantle and give us something to look forward to in a couple of years time!",9,3,6,17 May 2013
The Expendables," A séance that raises the ghosts of 80s action cinema with magnificent success
","We just saw 'THE EXPENDABLES' last night at a preview in London. We went in with a lot of fear and trepidation – Like all hyped movies there was a danger that all the excitement might collapse into a mass of disappointment, but fortunately this was not the case. 'THE EXPENDABLES' has 2 mission statements. (1) Reunite the heroes of B-action movies from the last 3 decades and (2) Make a purposefully retro action movie in the style of the 1980s, something that seems to be becoming quite popular as that era fades away and a new generation exists who were never there. Happily it succeeds perfectly in both cases. Stallone hasn't really been off screen so we are used to him. Dolph Lundgrun, his classic sparring partner, though looked rather wasted and it was shock to see him again like this. My wife said he reminded her of Kris Kristofferson, but then that might just be the way Scandinavian tough guys age? Statham and Li, also former sparring partners, did their usual stuff alongside the old timers. Mickey Rourke was good in his cameo, which was obviously filmed during breaks from IRON MAN 2 as he was still wearing his Ivan Danko look. Willis has never been off screen and is anyway quite familiar in little cameos nowadays. Schwarzanneger's cameo was a short comedy triumph, something that takes us out of the movie for a couple of minutes as the two old rivals square up. The second aim, to make a retro 80's He-Man actioner was spot on! Stallone and the screenwriters made sure they ticked most of the boxes on the form – The plot was wonderful old school! Setting it in a fictional South American country (so as to offend no one) was also perfect, and of course it revolves around some half-assed Cocaine growing program (where would 80s action cinema have been without Cocaine?) The Villains were also spot on 80s vintage. General Garza and Munroe were just the kind of 1 dimensional half baked baddies our action heroes used to face off against, unthreatening, unscary unfit middle aged men with serious overacting problems who were usually played either by the over the hill character actors who needed the work or by members of the production staff doubling up!! (This is actually one case where Eric Roberts famous 'skills' perfectly matched the character!) And of course this C-male villain had to have a real live wrestler as his henchman for heavy duty fights with the hero. (It was exciting in 2010 to see Stallone fight against another Wrestler baddie after the 'Rambo' and 'Rambo III' Soviet face offs. Plus of course Gary Daniels as kick-box henchman for Li and Statham to fight! ) Appropriately to the 80s genre, the women in this movie were both helpless victims there to be threatened and abused by bad men so they could be rescued by the good men. (This actually makes one think how far the representation of women has come in cinema in 25 years) The South Americans are also, in correct 80s mode, represented as primitive, backwards and living about 50 years behind the rest of us, helpless and cringing and in need of a big bad American saviour. The Action scenes were also 80s style, the 'run and shoot', and though many have complained about CGI in some of them, bear in mind that they would have used it like this in the 80s had it existed. The Truck chase was also nice and 80s style, complete with crash and fight in (what else but..)a disused factory!! The look of the film also had that kind of smoky foggy look many 80s movies had, but cleaned up to fit 2010 standards. The dialogue was also perfectly 80s action, ie absolutely terrible, embarrassing to deliver and painful to hear, and apart from Rourke's much commented 'Bosnia' monologue, the supposed moments of 'drama' (Statham's love life problems, Garza's conflicts with Munroe about his daughter) have that same beloved sub-daytime soap feel about them. So as a teaming of the ageing Titans it works and as a Séance calling of a long dead genre it also works beautifully. Leaving the cinema we felt that wonderful rush of nostalgic glee one used to feel coming out of the fleapit. Of course it also makes you realise how far cinema, and indeed the world, has come since then. We live in less innocent times now, and watching those old movies again on DVD makes one realise this. The world has to go forward, but sometimes it is nice to have something from the old country once in a while, and this delivers it with style!! Alas many critics and members of the public have damned this film for having a rubbish story, pathetic villains, wooden acting, atrocious dialogue, sexist and racist attitudes, cheap look and mindless action, perhaps forgetting that this is the whole point! What they are damning is 80s action cinema, and B-movie genre pictures in general, as critics have always done anyway. But which movies do people flock to see on a Saturday night with their friends or partners? What gives us a jolt of guilty pleasure with a big tub of popcorn and a mega coke? Even down to today's B-Movie masters like Luc Besson and Paul WS Anderson, it is this hated cinema which makes the money for all the other projects, which keeps cinemas running, and which",9,4,12,15 August 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain anti-America? Conspiracy thriller overdoes it on the politics but balances out with decent action and pace
","Captain America is perhaps the hardest character to do in 'the modern age' due to the post 60s fashion for 'hip-anti patriotism' in the Anglo- Saxon world. An integral part of 'The Avengers' he got his own rather underwhelming 2011 standalone that served as part of the run up to that all-star tag team. But what story could you give him between Loki and Ultron?Unsurprisingly Marvel has opted for 'hip anti-patriotism', a sort of inversion of the flag waving he represents, which would be quite interesting and refreshing in itself if only every other popcorn movie around for the last decade hadn't taken the exact same line! In fact any movie with even the tiniest little recognition that there are threats of any kind that have to be faced somehow would be a surprising change. Instead here, couched in the continuing Marvel plot arc, we have movie that tells us again that 'we are the only problem!', that those who try to stop world threats are in fact Nazis (literally here!) and only bending every sword into a ploughshare and sitting down to buy the world a Coke will lead to everyone singing in harmony. While admirable, it is precisely this sort of naive, insular 'splendid isolationism' that led directly to both world wars and is seemingly leading us towards the third one right now! If anything all of these movies will become historical documents of our time, like those 'Atomic science will cure everything' pictures of the 1950s.But enough of the socio-political analysis, how good is 'Winter Soldier' as a night's entertainment? Well it openly boasts of being more thriller than a superhero movie, and in that it works well. Captain America gets to do his thing a lot, and his shield finally becomes his signature weapon. There are spectacular car chases, especially early on featuring Nick Fury in a tricked out Tahoe vs a fleet of fake cop cars. Close quarter fist fights of every kind abound, even if they are shot with 'wobbly cam'. Three drone Heli-Carriers that are integral to the plot are well realised if destroyed a little too easily, and those 'Quinn- Jets' also turn up strafing our heroes everywhere they turn. Evans continues his maturity as Rogers/America, a doubting hero in the wrong time (he says so every other line in fact!) aided by Black Widow, who is more at home as a spy than as a 'super heroine' slaying Chitauri left and right. Johansson, who has been opting for every odd role going lately, looks oddly uncomfortable in the black leather this time, but that may just be the character arc. Samuel L. Jackson finally bends Fury around into his Tarantino mode that goes full 'gangsta' by the end. Robert Redford is in it is an acknowledged nod to the 70s conspiracy thrillers he once headlined and that 'WS' models itself on, playing the villain in far too relaxed a manner to be genuinely menacing. Marvel fans will already know exactly who 'The Winter Soldier' is and who he was before he became it, and he proves an interesting enemy here, yet with a lack of other 'heavies' he is left to carry the villainy alone and it is a tough load even for someone with a metal arm. Anthony Mackie finally brings 'Falcon' to the screen, even if he ends up looking more like turbo 'Condorman' and is not even that big a presence anyway despite Mackie's winning performance.The film continues the post-Avengers trend of 'scorched earth', seemingly destroying everything that came before it, presumably to then rebuild again in 'Age of Ultron' (if anyone cares anymore by that stage?) A couple of rather confusing post-credit scenes (one after end title design and at the very end as usual) hint at what is to come in future attractions.Not a conventional 'superhero' film, it is a modest entry that is slightly above 'Iron Man 3' (it actually features some Captain America!) and 'Thor Dark World' (it has an actual story and some energy behind it) if one lowers their bar suitably. The films heavy handed politics will certainly alienate many but they are not exactly hidden so you take it as you find it.",7,2,8,26 March 2014
Interstellar," Nolan enters wormhole to go back to the 1970s but cosmic forces bend everything badly out of shape
","The 70s, it seems, is where the cinema zeitgeist is at the moment. From bleak sparse thrillers ('Jack Reacher' – 'A walk among the tombstones') to Horror (Under the Skin' -'You're Next' and 'The Guest') to Sci-Fi ('Guardians of the Galaxy) to anarchic comedy ('Wolf of Wall Street') everyone is wearing retro. Now it's Christopher 'The Messiah' Nolan 's turn with a brave and ambitious stab at the cerebral sci-fi of the early 70s. A difficult enough genre at the best of times ('cold' and 'dry' are kind terms, 'pretentious', 'boring' and 'painfully dull' less kind) it takes someone of Nolan's current stature to sell such a project today. Has it worked? Well yes and no.The story is, like the originals, very hazy and has Humanity slowly dying out from nature itself turning against us, something we see through the rather limited prism of a dirt farm in the mid-west (dirt farm and dirt cheap!) Although the fate of all humanity is at stake we concentrate only one family, that of widowed ex-Nasa pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his unnaturally smarty pants daughter Murphy (Mackenzie Foy as a kid, Jessica Chastain as an adult) who through some weird messaging from beyond end up with boffin Dr Brand (Michael Caine) After a very long time we finally blast off on 'mankind's last hope', an exploration ship that goes through a wormhole that has very handily just appeared near Saturn. From there it's off to three planets, 'water world' 'ice world' (where Matt Damon appears as 'poorly sketched but necessary human antagonist') and finally 'rock world'. Then Cooper, who despite all of humanity being in his hands thinks more about his daughter than anything else (Selfish? Not really because love is the 5th dimension apparently) leaves his co-pilot Amelia (Anne Hathaway) and leaps into a giant black hole which, rather than utterly destroying him, leads him to some sort of time-gate built by humanities distant descendants who have learnt to master the 4h dimension so that he can set everything in motion. Then there's possibly the most forced happy ending in cinema history and what could be a sequel lead in.The original 70's movies were roughly divided between pessimistic (We're all frakked and we deserve it) and the optimistic (Humanity will thrive no matter what and there are higher forces out there helping us out too) and 'Interstellar' falls squarely into the second category. . As many have pointed out the main players (Cooper-Amelia-Murphy-Dr Brand, the red shirted crew) are one-dimensional cyphers (as they were then) but here Nolan has found his forte anyway since it can be argued that the same is true of all Nolan movie characters. It's clinical coldness it counter-weighs with 'emotional heft', also known as 'schmaltz' and 'cheese'. Not quite as sick bag inducing as the absurd 'Gravity' it still manages to raise plenty of groans and face palms from the get-go. Everyone gets a chance to cry and weep and make important, unlikely speeches about the power of love, the nature of the human spirit, etc. Also a lot of major short cuts are taken with the science especially towards the end where it reaches such heights of tenuous straw grabbing that you could imagine Adam West and Burt Ward's Batman and Robin making similar deductions ('The message said 'Stop!' And what do you do when you 'stop'? – 'You Wait!' – 'Exactly Robin! Wait- WEIGHT! Weight is obviously the secret to time!' 'Holy time machine Batman, we have to use gravity to stop time!' 'Exactly Robin, that's what Dr Brand was missing all the time!')What the 70s sci-fi films lacked in narrative cohesion or character building they made up for in striking images and music and this film delivers that in abundance. The movie's look is carefully designed to evoke the 70s, complete with that 'grainy' 70mm film some people are complaining about and a design aesthetic that is 40 years old. While impressive in its recreation, a lot of it looks frankly ridiculous in 2014, especially the 'walking block' robots that became such an integral part of the tale. Even the special effects all look practical (or are CGI made to look practical or a combination of both) and ships look like models clumsily blue screened and matted that move at odd jerky right angles (on controlled pole arms) over painted backdrops. Again, this is wonderfully nostalgic and accurate to the source but it looks cheap and amateurish to a mainstream audience. Thematically also it has that 70s combo of 'Space Race optimism' (when we all believed we'd be having holiday's on Mars by 2000) and 'New Age' philosophy, both lingering hangovers from the 60s.The brooding Organ led music by Hans Zimmer (who else) is a good imitation of Phillip Glass and suits the film well, doing a lot of the 'talking' for it. Acting wise it is a lot of familiar faces really going through the motions but then Nolan movies are never acting tour-de- forces.The Nolan brothers are to be congratulated on attempting to do something like this and to explore some (sadly) rarely visited themes including the power of wonder and striving that fuels science and exploration, mankind not being isolated but part of a greater unity we can perceive but barely understand (yet) the bonds of love in a Universal context, (etc) even when the result comes out looking rather too silly and melodramatic, melding stony seriousness with frankly ridiculous events and impossible coincidences. One to watch, but with a big pinch of salt!",7,1,5,8 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Del Toro's classic Anime and Kaiju homage is Gold for the fans but may leave non-fans perplexed at the multi-plex
","I admit I've been very excited about this movie since the first posters & trailers appeared, mainly because I am coming at it from a similar place to Del Toro himself, someone who grew up loving the classic Japanese 'Mecha-Anime' series which were bigger than God back in the 70s and 80s in Italy, Spain and other Latin countries (and who is also a big fan of their forbears, the 'man in a monster suit' Kaiju films). That someone was attempting to make a live action summer blockbuster film based on them was exciting enough, but when that man was the great visionary Del Toro himself, then something really special seemed on the cards.Of course expectations had to be dampened down, and wisely so. The film's biggest flaw is the plot. In condensing a typical anime series into 2hrs 11 minutes you have to concentrate on just the bare basics, and that makes for a very generic, seen it all before outline. Gone are most of the little sub-plots and character dynamics which gave the originals their quiet poetry, philosophy, humour and tragedy, and in their place is the standard 'maverick rejected by others –pissing contest-learning to work together-taking the enemy down with desperate last plan' arc. If you're familiar with the originals then you can pretty much mentally fill in the blanks. If you're not then it's going to look very thin and underwhelming. It reminded me a lot of 1999's 'Wing Commander', another retro-styled cheap and cheerful cheesefest.The cast is also made up of genre archetypes – the lone maverick hero (Hunmann) the traumatised heroine desperate to prove herself and take revenge (Kikuchi), the arrogant jock who doesn't want the lone maverick on the team (Kazinsky) The aloof father figure head of operations (Elba) the pair of comedy bickering scientists (Day and Gorman) and the comical gangster (Perlman) – people who you would never in a million years imagine, nor want, as humanities last line of defence, but who somehow end up that way. In cartoon form it just about works, but in making them flesh and blood, the illusion is totally shattered. The actors, who apart from Elba, Perlman (and Spanish comedian Santiago Segura making another cameo for Del Toro as Perlman's henchman) are largely unknowns, do what they can, but there seems something deliberately false and forced about the acting, as if Del Toro was going for cheese knowingly, a tongue firmly in cheek, always a tricky route to take. The dialogue, which again apes that of the originals, comes off as rather silly, and Elba's grand rousing pre-battle speech sounds just daft.Kikuchi's traumatic flashbacks to her experience as a child facing an early monster in Tokyo, and her rescue by a young Elba, are a rare but welcome bit of 'depth' from the originals and in Del Toro's hands comes off very effectively. Similarly the comic side-route by the scientists to find parts of a monster brain to meld with by way of comedy gangster Perlman are funny and welcome.The film borrows liberally from various series, both anime and live- action 'Kaiju', both in plot and look. The main story seems borrowed from the classic Getter Robot, in which an underground civilization of fully evolved dinosaurs attempts to take back Earth from newcomers Man by way of huge hybrid dinosaur-cyborg monsters called 'Mecha-Zaus' which spring up from below the ocean to strike a will. The mythology has been slightly rejigged, and a 'dimensional breech' idea invented to fill in the obvious credibility gap of having an underground kingdom near the Earth's core. We see a few glimpses of these creatures, and of the monster-building process, but they are totally absent as characters, and so the story suffers. Part of the fun of the originals was having an enemy team, often back-stabbing and infighting for influence among themselves throughout the series course, but here they are unseen, and the Mecha-Zaus just crazed beasts. Other plot elements are borrowed from different series, as are the looks of the 'Jaeger' robots. The main robot is modelled on the classic Tetsujin-28 (Del Toro's favourite) while the Australian and Chinese robots take their inspiration from the later Macross series, and the heavy tank like Russian robot seems an ode to similar battle suits in 'Gundam'. The piloting process is also updated, with a neuro-link called 'drifting' whereby two become-one with the robot, and their body movements match up those of the robots. Similar ideas where floated in the originals, with an almost mystical link between pilot and machine, but most controlling was done by pulling various levers around, so this is an improvement on that. It also provides a vital plot point during the second act.The Kaiju/Mecha-Zaus are also varied (the originals had special teams who worked on creating different enemy monsters/robots every episode) with dragon, gorilla, swordfish, tortoise, alligator and lobster inspired creatures. Each is given a Japanese codename, but sadly their names do not flash up beneath them in Japanese script when they first appear as they did in the originals! The fights are rough and violent, and battle winning weapons are only taken out at the last second for dramatic effect (as in the series) while superficial damage and anguish is visited upon the pilots. Many of the robots shown in posters never appear, while the Russian and Chinese robots, though really built up, are destroyed in seconds in an anti-climactic way.In many ways this, like earlier live-action anime 'Speed Racer', was never going to be a big winner, but rather a labour of love to and for a certain crowd. For the non anime/kaiju fan, it can still be a very fun night out, with great effects (The 3D is really used here) a few laughs, light tragedy and plenty of action which mercifully doesn't take itself too seriously. Don't expect too much and you should be entertained.",8,7,11,13 August 2013
Rush," Gather ye forth to hear the epic tale of Hunt and Lauda, as told by Howard of Oklahoma!
","Sport and the rivalry between champions has been an integral part of Western drama and culture since it's inception in ancient Greece, replete with archetypes of struggle, hubris, victory and loss, triumph and tragedy. With the advent of organised mass participation sports in the 20th century, the sports tales enjoyed a revival in popular culture, but their basic structure and purpose remained intact. 'Rush' is just such a tale, taken from real life and made into an epic poem for the masses.The sport in question is Formula 1 (The world racing league popular especially in Europe, Asia and South America but largely unknown in the USA) which has all the required thrills of speed, skill and danger as well as brilliant mavericks at the wheel, the modern day epic charioteers. The story it tells is that of the infamous 1976 season - a period when danger and death still stalked the sport in a way that has been largely erased today -and the rivalry between two legendary drivers, the Briton James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. The two came from similar backgrounds (wealthy business families) which they shunned to pursue the chequered flag. However their personalities were polar opposites, Hunt was the typical Errol Flynn style devil may care cad gay-blade and libertine, living for the girls, the booze,the adventure and the Devil take tomorrow. Lauda on the other hand was the cold, clinical rationalist technocrat who calculated everything in terms of percentages, including risk, and who treated fun and happiness as enemies of a stable existence. The media naturally played up the rivalry and turned the season into a battle between the two. Their rivalry was indeed very personal, and the two never lost an opportunity to mock or belittle the other, yet like all epic enemies they not only respected each other but needed each other, one not whole without the other, day and night, ying and yang. Like all epic tales, theirs came complete with shades of both victory and tragedy. Lauda crashed and was terribly scarred by fire during the Nurburgring race, nearly dying, yet he fought back and even returned to racing mere weeks later, still contesting the title, and despite losing to Hunt, went on to win many more championships and became a successful business mogul and technological innovator to boot. Hunt fought back against seemingly endless hurdles and setbacks to claw impossible victory with sheer guts and pluck to take the world championship, yet his wild ways destroyed his marriage and happiness then eventually his whole life, ending up dead aged just 45.The film is a British-European one, telling a European legend, yet it has the most American of directors, Ron Howard. Surprisingly, the film is largely devoid of Howard's trademark sugariness and mawkish sentimentality save for the final coda, and even that feels strangely appropriate given the story he has told.Instead it showcases Howard's technical flare and experienced hand, telling the convergent and then concomitant stories of Hunt and Lauda, including their courtships and marriages, in just two hours in a time when even action movies with nothing to say scrape the three hour mark as a norm. His visual skill is also notable, not only in the all important Formula 1 scenes, which wisely follow Frankenheimer's example in 'Grand Prix', but also in giving the film a good sense of period feel. For a cheap film, it looks great. The script by Peter Morgan also follows classical form and avoids making it a simplistic battle between a 'good guy' and a 'bad guy' (as many sports biographies do to their shame and detriment), instead giving us two great heroes, flaws and all.The score comes courtesy of the legendary Hans Zimmer, and is strictly in the 'Gladiator' mould (aptly enough) with epic themes laced with anthems of struggle and victory, and laments of tragedy and loss. Complementing it is a selection of fantastic songs from the period from the likes of Thin Lizzy, David Bowie, Mud, Slade, Stevie Winwood, Clara Nunes & Rosanna Fratello.Of course everything hangs on the actors playing the mythic heroes, and here is the film's greatest strength, two well known skillful actors who also look remarkably similar to their real life counterparts. Chris Hemsworth, playing the dashing heroic Hunt with an upper class English brogue naturally evokes 'Thor', yet the evocation is suitable, as both are mythic figures who start out as cads and grow into wisdom. He finds both the dash and the inner pain of the character and makes us care for him despite his many faults. Similarly, Daniel Bruhl, best known as the sniper in 'Inglorious Bastards', gives us a Lauda who is cold, unlikeable, rude, very arrogant and superior, and a poor loser, yet also finds the buried spark of life in the man, a passion that is expressed in the language of mechanics but comes from a strong heart, especially in the powerful bond he has with his wife Marlene. She is played excellently by Alexandra Maria Lara, while Hunt's rather temporary wife, supermodel Suzy Miller, is played by an unrecognisable Olivia Wilde, emoting pathos for the love she hoped for but never found. The rest of the cast is well filled with excellent veteran character actors, including Pierfrancesco Favino as Ferrari teammate Clay Regazzoni and Christian McKay as Hunt's humorous aristocratic backer Lord Hesketh.A powerful and engrossing human story, epic poem and true life chronicle, it is enjoying great popularity in Europe and elsewhere but will inevitably face problems in F1-phobic America. Let us hope it can cross this cultural barrier, as many, many US sports movies have coming in the opposite direction, and be enjoyed for the universal tale it is, well told, thrilling and uplifting.",9,5,8,22 September 2013
Oblivion," Oblivion Legacy....A slow burn to the not quite end of the world
","The first real blockbuster of Summer 2013 is here, and it's written and directed by Joseph Kosinski, of 'Tron Legacy' fame. That belated sequel divided audiences, and received a lot of criticism for being too 'slow' and 'ponderous', too dark and too dramatic. Well I can happily report that Kosinski has ignored those critics and produced a film which is in every way a soul mate to 'Tron Legacy'. How excited this will make you feel depends on how you felt about 'TL'. If you liked it you will probably like this, if you didn't then you probably won't.The storyline is not particularly original – We have a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the 2 remaining technicians live in sterile comfort as they run the machines that run the rest. We have the 'established past' of an Alien invasion repulsed that of course will be found to be a lie, we have the curiosity of the drone that leads him to rebel and make common cause with the rag tag underground who seek to retain their humanity, questions of identity and truth, sacrifice and the greater good etc. it's very much in the style of the cold cerebral sci-fi movies of the 1960s and 70s ('Logans Run' 'THX1138' 'Planet of the Apes' 'Rollerball' and 'Silent Running' spring immediately to mind, as does 'The Matrix' and 2010's 'Moon') complete with all white utility wear, crisp but soulless plastic luxury pads, functional machines, long slow takes, etc. It is however very well done, and is not derivative or boring (at least for those with a little attention span left) though you will probably see all the 'twists' and turns coming a long way off.The cast, as is the norm for the genre, is limited, but well filled. Tom Cruise, no stranger to modern troubling sci-fi, does well as the troubled hero Jack, and still looks young enough to pass for a man obviously meant to be in his thirties at most. The film's journey is all his, and he covers the territory like the pro he is. Morgan Freeman appears as the 'wise old black guide' character, but his underground leader is really more of an extended cameo so don't expect too much of him. Ditto for his two generals, played by well-known Nikolaj Koster- Waldau and Zoe Bell, who are obviously very important in the scheme of things but have hardly any dialogue and just stand around looking interested (I suspect some of their scenes were cut) Melissa Leo makes a good 'system controller' who is only seen afar on a computer screen, and is obviously not what she seems, her friendly southern tones twisted for menace very subtly. That leaves the two female leads. As Yulia, the mysterious crashed Astronaut who triggers Jack's crisis of faith, Olga Kurylenko does well, but her natural limitations still hold and she is never a burning personality, but in the scheme of the film her cold, distant character works effectively. Much better is rising British actress Andrea Risborough, who essays Jack's co-technician and lover Victoria. Unlike Olga, she is required to do more, and she does it perfectly. Her love for Jack, her strong impulse to avoid going back to the 'old world', her tormented jealousy when Yulia appears on the scene, are all beautifully portrayed. The answer to her character's strange conundrum is answered in a near end scene which makes Victoria all the more worthy of pathos.There is some action, mainly involving the little Ornithopter style vehicle that Jack flies, and the killer ball drones he normally maintains, and they too are very reminiscent of the exciting light-jet duel at the end of 'Tron Legacy' (as too are the ship designs, un- coincidentally) and a few gun battles in dark underground caverns. It is not a 'wham-bam' rip roaring explosion fest, nor is it the most intellectual film ever made, but it lies in a very comfortable slot in between, and hopefully will be a success and cement Kosinki's reputation. I for one am still waiting on his promised remake of one of my all-time favourite's 'The Black Hole', because if there is one director around who could do it justice then it is him!",Null,3,7,12 April 2013
Man of Steel," Man of Steel - with a steel broomstick up his behind! No laughs for this serious Superman
","At last the waiting is over! The year's most eagerly anticipated film is finally here!The story goes like this – Krypton is an advanced society that works on classical utopian ideals: Population is controlled and people are artificially bred from a 'codec' of all the races DNA in order to fulfil specific functions. Core drilling has led to impending doom, and military leader Zod (Shannon) launches a failed coup to amend the situation. His friend Jor-El (Crowe) breeds an illegal natural son with wife Lara (Zurer) and sends it off to Earth to lead them to greatness and wisdom, packing his consciousness in a pen-drive and the DNA codec along with him. Krypton is destroyed while the plotters are sent on a Phantom Zone bound ship (but saved by the explosion)On Earth Kal-El is found by Ma and Pa Kent (Costner and Lane) who raise him up, aware of how special he is, and try to guide his future development as the man who will change everything. Growing into adulthood he hides his gifts and works as an drifter doing odd jobs but always ends up performing miraculous rescues, until he chances upon an abandoned Kryptonian coloniser ship buried deep beneath Alaska. Here he meets up with spunky reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) who becomes obsessed by his story. Zod and co turn up, attempting to terraform Earth into a Krypton-like world where they can save the race using the Codec DNA stored inside Kal's own cells. Working with the military and Lois, Kal has to choose between saving his old race and saving the new one he has grown to accept as his own.The tone, as you might expect from the triptych of Snyder, Nolan & Goyer, is serious, dark, sombre and intense, with none of the humour or levity that brightened the earlier movies. The romance is also non- existent till a final coda which sets up the Clark Kent-Daily Planet situation of lore, though with Lane in the know from the off. Instead she is the plucky reporter repeatedly saved from danger and later an active participant in the battle thanks to info she got from the ghostly Jor-El. The Kansas scenes do have some of the 'Malick' feel suggested by the trailers, providing a suitable backdrop for the film's main narrative thrust: Kal's existential crisis over his origins and his eventual decision to embrace his new world even at the cost of the old one (A choice no previous Superman ever had to make) Of course we know his decision already, we are just seeing HOW he reached it. Zod, unlike Terence Stamp's cult portrayal, is not a narcissist or power hungry madman but instead an angry patriot, bred to protect Krypton (like a machine he was programmed for this task) which he tries to do first by overthrowing the blind, corrupt Krypton government, then by re- establishing a Kryptonian population on Earth. As a result he is not so much evil as differently prioritised, making his conflict with Superman one of clashing needs rather than good vs evil. When the original series came out, they were the only Superhero game in town, and by the end of the 80s their wholesome all-Americanism had bred a 'counter-hero' culture in the form of Burton's brooding Batman and Alan Moore's 'Watchmen' saga (ironically Snyder's previous comic book gig) However now in 2013 we are saturated by graphic heroes everywhere, and all heroes, including James Bond and Spiderman, are now depressed confused characters who spend more time battling their own demons than they do any serious enemies. As a result, this 'fresh' approach to Superman well, doesn't feel FRESH! It feels so oddly familiar, beat for beat, made worse by many elements which seem almost lifted directly from other sources. The planet krypton looks like 'The Immortals' meets 'John Carter of Mars', the ship under the ice is all but 'The Thing', and the renegade extremists from another world who try to save their planet by terraforming this one, faced by Earth values loving co-aliens is almost identical to both 'Transformers' sequels, an impression enhanced by the similar looking New York battle of US military and bug-like alien ships complete with crashing skyscrapers and 9/11 street scenes. The final superman duel between Kal and Zod feels just like that which ended 'The Matrix' series, complete with Zod giving a 'You have stripped me of purpose! Now I will take yours from you!' speech to kick it off. The special effects are also not that special, and often look like those from the original series. Acting wise Caville is good as Kal, brooding mostly, though with none of Reeves' natural charisma (He never gets to be Clark Kent so the range is more limited). Amy is OK as Lane, again more action girl than lover here, while Kevin Costner & Diane Lane are a good embodiment of the wholesomeness the Kents represent. Crowe is more action hero than Brando's thinker and thanks to a ghostly avatar is around for a lot of the time on Earth. The normally brilliant Shannon disappoints, his Zod a well-intentioned thug with a penchant for shouting every word out loudly. He has 2 cohorts, one female (Antje Traue) and one superhumanly strong one (unseen under a mask), subtle nods to original Zod sidekicks Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Hallaran, but they have none of the fun of the originals.The film is well made, and spectacular, and well performed by all. The design looks lovely, as do the costumes, and a conscious rift has been made with the Salkind series while still making subtle nods to it. If it disappoints it is because so much has been promised, and though an enjoyable experience, it all feels oddly hollow and unsubstantial.Sequels will presumably fill the narrative out (and hopefully be more original!)",Null,0,2,14 June 2013
Ender's Game," What does it profit a man to save the world and lose his soul? Hood doesn't flinch from dark nature of Card's seminal novel.
","Science fiction started life around the Enlightenment as a conduit for debates about society, about morals and about what makes us human, and what the future might hold, maintaining that same role as our science and technology advanced exponentially over the centuries. Then came its poorer sibling, the sci-fi that was just about the thrills and spills and the effects and action only. The best science fiction of course is a fine blend of the two, of the cerebral and the visceral.One such novel was 'Enders Game' by the Orson Scott Card, which used the familiar sci-fi cliché of the alien invasion of Earth and the pan- national fight back to examine a very real but troubling dilemma which affects any nation that considers itself to be 'modern' and 'civilized', which is that often in order to protect those very things, we, or those entrusted to defend us, have to embrace the opposite of all our values. The young men and women we take and train to kill without hesitation and mercy, to risk death and injury while taking life, then expecting them to return home and be normal. But to abandon that duty of defence may leave our values and our futures at stake, and so by doing nothing lose everything. Is there even a correct answer to this conundrum, and if not then how can we handle the conflict that arises?After many years as 'an unfilmable novel' it finally arrives as an impressive medium budget movie. Director Gavin Hood, who helmed the mess that was 'X-Men origins: Wolverine' 4 years ago redeems himself on the sci-fi front by delivering a film that is at once spectacular looking and narratively flowing and gripping, while at the same time not flinching from the dark, sombre heart of the story.The plot takes place 50 years after a devastating attack on Earth by highly evolved Ants called 'Formics' who were looking for new colonies to deal with their chronic over-population, an invasion repulsed thanks to an 'ID4' style manoeuvre by legendary pilot Mazer Rackham. What was left of us evolved into a highly advanced, but highly militarised society with interstellar capability and fleets of high tech space cruisers. The military realised that the best minds for strategy where those of children, who were gifted in intuition and daring thought lost in conventional upbringings, and so train the young at tough military academies, selecting the best for officer command. The brightest star is young Ender Wiggin ('Hugo's Asa Butterfield) who is targeted by chillingly utilitarian General Graff (Harrison Ford) who subjects him to often horrifying mind games, putting him into conflicts with the other cadets around him, isolating him and putting his back ever further to the wall. The only one to help is psychologist Anderson (Viola Davis) who knows that she is complicit in the warping and destruction of the souls of children even if it is to a greater good. He makes enemies but also friends, chief among which is Petra (Hailee Steinfield) When he shows brilliance at the zero gravity team war games, a fight with another cadet ends in tragedy and Ender turns his back on everything, being especially conflicted by the fact that his unique understanding of Formic thought and culture makes him empathise with the very ones he is to destroy. Using his beloved sister Valentine (Abigail Breslin) as leverage, Ender is given command of a fleet positioned off the Formic homeworld, with Petra and his friends as his team, where a massive military build-up is terrifying the veteran top brass into a strategy of all out aggression. Here he is taken under the wing of Mazer Rackham (Ben Kingsley) himself. As the big attack on Formica approaches, Ender begins to feel some of the Formics are trying to communicate with him telepathically. Can peace prevail, or can only one race be left standing? And even if they win, what will be left of the soul of Ender and his team at the end of it?The special effects are impressive, even if most of the 'big battle' stuff is in the trailer. The excellent cast all do justice to their characters and their struggles, and every part from the major to the minor are well filled and directed. The film also updates the sentiments to our current world, not hiding the obvious fact that we are all living out this dilemma right now but without giving simple answers. 'Star Trek', which was the modern home of ethical dilemma sci-fi, attempted to grapple with similar questions in this summer's 'reboot' instalment 'Star Trek into the Darkness', yet did so with all the clumsiness, lack of skill and tracing paper thin profundity typical of what now calls itself 'Star Trek'. This film on the other hand treats it as the REAL series that Gene Rodenberry created would have. It also evokes thoughts of some of the higher end Japanese Manga and Anime, who use a similar set up and youthful military elite in their dark, ethically troubled tales.Not the fun, exciting happy go lucky movie for kids that some of the marketing suggests, it is instead a deep, warm, troubling, thrilling, moving, spectacular film that is suitable both for adults (despite the juvenile cast) and for teenagers and children (8+) who will hopefully be introduced to the ideas and questions it raises, and will find themselves stimulated to form their own answers, as they must inevitably do some day.",Null,52,86,25 October 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," B-Movie and proud - An absurd idea played straight enough to just about work as action horror
","Delayed for a year to cash in on the 'Renner' effect, this movie is finally here (in the UK anyway, later than a lot of countries but that's often the case) It's hard to know what one can expect of a film like this. Another in the ever growing 'modern spin on the fairy tale' cycle, this film evades the usual updated psycho-sexual variations of the story that have existed for a long time to go for a simple 'what if?' future where the siblings become a sort of Van Helsing style professional witch killers, bringing them in on a case that becomes a 'countdown to doom' scenario as the witches prepare for a once in a generation ceremony that will make them immune to fire (rather like Vampires seeking immunity from sunlight situation) During this case they will also (A) Discover things about themselves and their own past (B) Discover that not all witches are evil, some fight for good (C) Have to confront their own prejudices in light of B (D) Face old nemesis supreme head witch Muriel, connected to their past tragedy (E) Befriend a misunderstood Ogre (F) Patiently tolerate an obsessed fan boy (G) Save some kids marked for death at Muriel's ceremony. Much violence and gore will follow. Anachronistic weapons will be fired, colourful witches will be slaughtered in mass, and warm, lovable, gay spirited people with 'dead meat' written on their foreheads will naturally die to raise our revenge driven bloodlust as our heroes deal violent justice to the unholy.Refreshingly, the film doesn't pussy out for a neutered PG13 family friendly rating (a terrible cinema sin that film companies are increasingly going against) but instead heads for 'Evil Dead' territory, with over the top gore, absurdly violent deaths, nudity and swearing, all in 3D, which is quite well used here, with depth between objects and speed/space during fast action scenes thoroughly planned and set up.Despite the high budget, this is unashamedly a B-movie in Corman and Troma traditions, and never aims to be more than dumb fun, despite various stabs at genuine emotion and pathos throughout. The film's famed production history attests to its schizophrenic nature. Born as an out and out Gothic comedy from the Ferell-Mackay stable, it apparently pulled up when the similar 'Your Highness' tanked (understandable given that it was a decently made movie torpedoed by a scattershot improv style that didn't suit it) and was retooled as an 'Evil Dead' style comedy horror under the direction of Norwegian pulper Tommy Wirkola. As a result, the films tone and approach veer violently from out and out absurdist comedy to serious supernatural horror drama. One moment it's Mel Brooks, the next it's 'Blade' or 'Van Helsing', and the seams are quite visible. Kudos to Wirkola and team for playing such an absurd idea straight, giving us an entertaining Saturday night movie rather than a DOA would be comedy, and since its only raison d'etre is some bloody popcorn fun then it succeeds.Cast wise it features good actors slumming it. Gemma Arterton is back with an American accent (I guess it was either Renner doing British or her doing AmericanShe must have had the better accent) playing her usual ballsy tough chick thing, though this time using actual weapons and violence. Jeremy Renner, not yet a new action star when this rolled, seems rather bored by the whole thing, and his character is highly unlikeable and unsympathetic (I get he's meant to be, but he went FULL asshole here!). Villain duties are pulled by the great Famke Janssen, who was upfront about just doing it to pay off her debts, but she still delivers the goods here. Her Muriel is like X-Men 3's Phoenix but without the conflict and inner turmoil. She's bad, she's ultra-powerful and she's having fun, though the lovely Famke is just her Human disguise, with nasty powder blue zombie being her natural look. Peter Stormare is back again with another in his gallery of over the top villains as the town sheriff who fears Hansel and Gretel more than he does the witches, and gets an extremely unpleasant end. Finnish beauty Pihla Viitala does well as the very red headed good witch Mina (she even colour coordinates her outfits to match her red hair) who becomes a love interest to Hansel and the one who makes him face his prejudices, and her character earns our care as the story progresses.The special effects are also very good, especially the Witches make up and the animatronic Ogre Edward, which like 'Your Highness' are mostly practical and physical (Edward seems to come from the same designer who made 'YH's beautiful animatronic Minotaur) Blood and gore is done via CGI, which makes even lashings of red seem silly and inoffensive. One day horror producers will go back to jam and corn syrup and butcher's offal for real hurl stomach churning vileness, but not here alas.The film has been a big success in America, and our preview screening was packed, so I guess the gamble paid off. Worth watching if you want to see an adult cartoon in the 'Blade' mould (though nowhere near as good) that'll add nothing to your life but might give you 90 minutes occasional fun.",7,3,6,27 February 2013
Now You See Me," Magical Mystery film in a 60s Euro-Romp tradition that may not bring out the child in you but will sometimes treat you like one!
","We caught this movie at a special 'advanced screening' this week in the UK, though it has been out for a few weeks in the States.Four street magicians (Harelson, Fisher, Eisenberg and Franco) are hand picked by a mysterious hooded man to follow a grand plan, using incredible magic tricks to help right some historic wrongs centring on a once great magician who died attempting a career reviving 'underwater safe' escape trick years earlier. They hit a French bank, an insurance magnate, a Safe manufacturer and a slimy professional 'magic debunker' who destroys careers for his own profit - All LIVE on stage. An FBI agent (Ruffalo) and a sexy French interpol officer (Laurent) try to track them down but are always one step behind 'The 4 horsemen' and their mysterious leader.'Now You See Me' is an interesting little film, if only for what it tries, or THINKS its trying to do. The movie is a would be mind-frakk puzzle picture using the ever popular 'magic' cover to play with ideas of perception and comprehension, giving us false leads and upside down pictures all the way. It is easier said than done however, and to be honest it doesn't quite make it. The puzzle elements seem rather underwhelming, as if written for and by 8-10 yrs olds, and many adults in the audience may feel their intelligence being slightly insulted at many points. Also the 'power of Magic' idea running through it doesn't really translate to the modern cynical world. Is there ANYONE who DOESN'T know its all being done with smoke and mirrors and misdirection? Can a person become a multi-millionaire downloading programmes exposing Magicians as fakes? Would we even WANT to know how its done? Doesn't that ruin the magic of Magic?Not in this world, where people, even intelligent ones, remain goggle eyed in awe at even the simplest street conjuring tricks, and four rather tame (even slightly lame) street magicians can become national sensations overnight as 'The Four Horseman' even though in the real world such fame and sensationalism nowadays would come largely from driving kebab skewers into your own liver or setting yourself on fire whilst suspended naked over the Washington Memorial ('The Incredible Burt Wonderstone' had the same conversation earlier this year) Indeed there is a rather retro feel to the whole project, with those sort of happy go lucky, gay spirited Euro romps of the 1960s like 'How to Steal a Million' 'Gambit' and 'Topkapi' being its obvious inspiration. Problem of course is that this is a new world now, a more cynical and unforgiving one, and its light playfulness and easy 'magic' feel doesn't really translate well. The director is of course Louis Letterier, the French man of action from the Besson stable who gave us 'The Transporter' movies and more recently the successful updating of 'The Incredible Hulk' and the less successful updating of 'Clash of the Titans'. He channels not only those easy Euro comedies ( a very popular genre in French cinema of the time) but also an earlier Gallic series 'Judex', the masked magician who righted the injustices done to his family by the rich and powerful men of finance, as well as fighting the liars and oppressors of all classes and castes in the name of the innocent. He used magic to overcome his enemies, and also recruited a circle around him of hand picked assistants who had the heart and skill to become part of 'Team Judex'. It became a successful silent series in 1914-15, and also a very lovely film in 1961 by Georges Franju (now on DVD) The identity of this latest incarnation of 'Judex' (nowadays sporting a hoodie rather than his old uniform of fedora and face scarf) is revealed at the end, Who it is it would be wrong to say, but the field of suspects is limited, so a random shot may easily pick the right one.The show scenes are OK, if obviously done with CGI rather than any practical magical tricks. There is some action, including a crazed fight between the FBI and Danny Franco in his apartment, where magicians tricks are used as weapons as much as martial arts moves, and a tyre screeching car chase with a very unusual conclusion which reminds us this was made by the guy who brought you 'The Transporter' series.Acting wise everyone is good, especially Ruffalo, a great actor finally getting some of the recognition and kudos he deserves, who shows the frustration and rage of a professional trying to bring down something he cannot understand nor fight in the traditional manner. Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Basterds' plucky Jewish cinema owner) is perky and French as the perky French Interpol agent sent to work the Paris connection in America, becoming Ruffalo's partner, magical consultant, 'find the magic in your heart' cod philosopher and eventual romantic interest. Michael Caine does what he used to do very well, take a big cheque and coast in light material of this kind, while Morgan Freeman, another actor of stature who never let a poor script get in the way of an easy pay day, gives just enough to be convincing as the slimy professional 'magic debunker'Not the edgy dark drama it seems from the trailer, nor alas the brain- teasing puzzle picture ala 'The Game' or 'House of Games' or 'Inception' that they would like it to be. It is best enjoyed a breezy, fun picture which is different enough from the other movies around it to be a breath of some fresh air in this summer season. Just don't get offended when it talks down to you!",8,2,6,22 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Back to basics for story with lots of brain and a little brawn that does a difficult juggling act well.
","There were a lot of expectations resting on this movie's shoulders. A return from original director Bryan Singer, a resurrection of the original trilogy cast and a union of original trilogy and 'First Class'. Plus it features the beloved 'Sentinels' storyline and deals with time travel (always tricky) and the often used 'go back to the past to change the future' line, as well as heavy issues about war and peace and the power of choice over destiny etc. However, happily enough, this difficult and tricky balancing act has been pulled off with aplomb.The 'ravaged Earth' future (which is at odds with original trilogy but anyway..) is shamelessly derivative of 'The Terminator' and 'The Matrix' series, and they do not even try to hide it. Not so important given that it is just a bookend for the main story. Professor X and Magneto are now allies, facing an army of unstoppable anti-mutant robots called Sentinels which are like the offspring of the T1000 and Thor's Destroyer. Reduced to just a handful, it is decided to send Wolverine back to 1973 because he is the only one who can make the journey and also never ages (and because he is the main star of the series) His mission is to unite young Charles, a drug addicted wash out who is afraid of his mental powers, and young Lehnsherr, who is imprisoned beneath the Pentagon suspected of having assassinated Kennedy (?) Breaking him out with the aid of young Hank McCoy/Beast and Quicksilver, who can move at lightning speed, they have to stop Mystique, who is now a breakaway radical, from assassinating diminutive genius Bolivar Trask, inventor of the Sentinels, an act which will at once radicalise the human governments and provide Trask's team – headed by young Colonel Stryker – with her unique DNA that helps them create the T1000 like future Sentinels! After interrupting the first attempt at the Paris peace talks to end the Vietnam War (where Trask is trying to sell his Sentinels to the Reds) they then track her down to Washington where President Nixon is unveiling the first generation robots. However Magneto is following his own radical agenda and crashes the party by dropping a Stadium around the White House and hijacking the robots. With the future on a literal knife edge it will be a series of individual personal choices that decides everything.There is a predictable but cute coda in a totally new future that sees a lot of dead characters alive again (guess who in particular?) and the events of the previous 5 contemporary timeline movies seemingly rubbed out to start anew.The film returns to big ideas and concepts, something that defined the original trilogy but largely disappeared from subsequent entries. In many ways it evokes 'Watchman', right down to Nixon and a cold war milieu (here Vietnam) demonstrating human aggression and self destructiveness which a well meaning but misguided scientist hopes to end by uniting mankind against a common enemy (here mutants) It also returns to the core concept of X-Men, do you meet aggression and hostility with more aggression and hostility or do you reach out and change hearts and minds? Singer shows pros and cons of both sides but of course ends on a victory for peace and mutual tolerance. It is far more thought provoking and free thinking than the simplistic black and white agitprop of the overpraised 'Captain America the Winter Soldier'. The old free will/destiny dichotomy gets a fair airing as well with a message that even the smallest of gestures and choices can change not just our own lives but those of countless others. It is no coincidence that a classic Star Trek episode is playing in the background of a key moment!The film is not over abundant in action but then no previous X-Men ever was either. The 'Terminator' future scenes are pretty much all in the trailer and seem done with little real care. There are some interesting set pieces in the 70's section, notably Quicksilver's bullet time rescue and a fight around the Paris peace talks that's caught on 8mm 'found footage'. The biggest battle comes at the end with Magneto's stadium lift and White House destruction, even if the resolution is ultimately intellectual rather than pyrotechnic.Acting wise, Jackman is again the star playing a more chilled out Wolverine this time in his 6th turn! Stewart and Mckellen are cameos more than anything else , leaving the real screen time to Mcavoy and Fassbender, who here play intermediate versions of the characters. McAvoy has most to do as a self doubting pathetic druggy wreck that gets a little tiresome quickly. Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique gets another expanded role, driving the story along, but her performance is laconic and lacks passion. Nicholas Hoult is a nerdy Beast who can change at will while Game of Thrones star Peter Dinklage plays unintended villain Trask well and never loads his character or reaches for camp. Other brief returnees from the original trilogy include Ellen Page, Aaron Stanford, Shawn Ashmore and Halle Berry, though like the big two they're just there for recognition value and do little.Perhaps a little action-light for some fans and a seeming step back from the reboot project, this film is nonetheless an engrossing and unusual left turn for the series that leaves us wanting to know more as the credits roll.",8,2,3,22 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Iron man vs Captain America: Dawn of nothing in particular but a very interesting movie that's way better than that other one.
","Seems that this spring-early summer has turned into a sort of 'pistols at dawn' between DC and Marvel. DC fired first but shot themselves in both feet and blew their noses off too for good measure. If only they had stuck to Miller's excellent template it would have worked beautifully but David 'hands of death' Goyer and Zack Snyder had to show off how clever they were...'Have to save...MARTHA!' 'Riddle me this...Dad beat me and God must die...Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding!' 'You won't ever make Holly Hunter drink P***!'So Marvel has basically already won it by default but fortunately their volley turned out not to be so bad. Not brilliant but good. Certainly better than 'Age of Ultron', a movie that was not so much birthed as miscarried. Seems they've learnt their lesson and this third Avengers movie (never mind the Captain America tag. It could just as easily be called Iron Man Civil War) matches the character interaction and big fight fun of the original with the darker 70s thriller vibe of 'Winter Soldier'.That movie was a good thriller but non existent as a superhero flick and was marred by yet another 'there is no terrorism out there its just the guys in charge trying to scare you into submission line' that seems to have become the default position for many before the sheetstorm sweeping the world right now, the mantra to shout out as you see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. There are politics here too but they are more balanced and a real dilemma is presented to which they thankfully do not offer a solution. That dilemma, can super powered individuals operate at their own discretion as judge jury and executioner or must there be government accountability?, is one that has powered many comic book masterpieces including the 1987 double whammy 'Watchmen' (which Snyder made into a great movie) and 'Dark Knight Returns' (which Snyder turned into a pile of sheet) It powers the conflict between the characters until more personal and visceral ones take over.The scene everybody really wants to see is the 'Burly Airport Brawl' where the two sides go at each other with all their skills in a noisy and surprising battle that is light-hearted and fun in a way the rest isn't. That could be a mini movie in itself and its worth waiting for. There are a few action scenes around including yet another African rundown, this time against the masked Cross-bones and his crew, and the spectacular 'down the stairwell' and 'Tunnel chase/Audi Q7 advert' scenes in Bucharest but like 'WS' the rest of it is mainly downtime, yet the tension never drops and we feel the pressure building on everyone.There isn't really a villain here as the two sides are providing the opposition. Someone helps stoke things up and he is Helmut Zemo played by the brilliant Daniel Bruhl. The film doesn't 'stick like glue' (HA!) to his comic book character and they are only using the name here. In fact it could be argued that Zemo isn't even a villain and he is ultimately deemed too pitiful to even kill by his opponents once they see who he is and why he has done what he has.Spiderman is finally brought into the MCU and takes his place as an Avenger after years of protest with his backstory already done off screen (God, would we want to see it AGAIN?) with Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Marisa 'still so hot' Tomei as the comically sexy Auntie May. Black Panther also makes his début and despite his costume looking a little goofy he fits in well as does the now properly realised Wakanda. Hope they will be as well used in their own movies. - Ant-man makes the appearance promised at the end of his standalone but he is there to take part in the 'Big Brawl' and doesn't do much after. Falcon, Scarlet Witch and Vision are all beefed up and given more time and character depth here while Black Widow sort of hangs around the edges and doesn't get very involved in things for once though she too is in the action. Excuses for why Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't appear continue and are getting more and more stretched. Just recast and have done with it please!Again, a summer blockbuster that is marketed at kids but is geared entirely at adults (after BvS and Zootopia) and will mean very little to younger audiences though the big fight will be sure to entertain.So a victory on points for Marvel but a well deserved one and definitely worth going to see.",8,6,12,29 April 2016
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Desolation of Tolkien! - The Main Course arrives and it tastes off..
","Almost everything that needs to be said this film has already been said, not just now but last year when the whole 'three epics' plan was unveiled. Of course it is ridiculous to extend a simple 300 page fairy story (not an insult to call it that, being a staunch Campbellian) to three 3 hour movies and to try and inject it with a lot of fake gravitas and importance not fitting or suitable to the subject. The producers know this, and Peter Jackson knows it too. Jackson strived for years to make the ultimate motion picture experience of Tolkien's classic, and it worked, and at a decades remove it is now rightly a touchstone of popular culture on a par with Star Wars and Star Trek, and will probably remain so forever. He has done what he needed to, there is nowhere left for him to go now, nothing left for him to prove. Gulliermo Del Toro was given Jackson's blessing to make the most incredible movie of 'The Hobbit', but things went south and New Line went to him to make a 'product' and that is what he has made. There is almost no guile in this project, no hiding behind claims of art of reinvention. This is 'Peter Jackson's shameless cash grab' pure and simple. The way that ridiculous action scenes and contrived 'dramas' of the cheesiest and most shop-worn kind are shoehorned into the narrative is literally laughable. One moment someone will be having a discussion or a little scene from the book, then suddenly doors will slam open and hundreds of Orcs will rush in and a stupid 10 minute fight scene will ensue complete with cod-heroic music to complement the cod-heroics and embarrassing dialogue! The book will flow, then suddenly two characters will start engaging in a long winded, stomach churning romance that would shame even the most shameless teen fiction! It is almost like watching a parody of fantasy action made by Mel Brooks, the Zucker brothers or the South Park team. Jackson must know how ridiculous it all is, and perhaps that is his big in-joke, rather like how the once great Ridley Scott has been increasingly delighting in extracting the urine from audiences and critics with celluloid 'fingers' like 'Robin Hood' 'Prometheus' and 'The Counsellor'. I don't know if the producers know or even care? They are just out to make as much buck as they can, and it's working.In no way can episode 1, or this instalment be considered an adaptation of 'The Hobbit', hence the ire of fans on this site and beyond. One positive however is once 'The Lord of the Rings prequels' are completed next year, there will be room to make a REAL version of the novel at some point, and that will no doubt be the film fans have always dreamed of and that Tolkien's masterpiece deserves. As for these 'films', the best way to enjoy them is either as straight up fantasy actioners (if you have no sense of irony) or as delirious camp burlesque parodies of all the tropes 'LOTR' embodied. As to the film itself, the Dwarfs we met in the first film have literally melded into a composite whole, and Bilbo has become a spectator in the story. Apart from his two 'in the book' heroic moments (slaying spiders and taunting a big dragon) he does virtually nothing. Legolas is drawn back, though his inclusion is not so egregious as some others. Along for the ride is Tauriel (the very lovely Evangeline Lilly) who has the same role 'expanded Arwen' did in 'LOTR', ie to add some oestrogen and some romance to a story that had none. She is the standard D&D 'hot sassy bow slinging action Elf in a tight outfit' sex fantasy and does plenty of bow slinging and sexy orc slaying, then gets involved in aforementioned 'absurd romance' with one of the dwarfs (Kili) that leads to equally absurd 'romantic triangle' with Legolas who has the Elvin hots for her. Which will we she choose? 'Team Kili' or 'Team Legolas'? Does anybody care? Does Jackson care if anybody cares? Ridiculous time killing action scenes include the barrel escape from the Woodland Elves castle, which has been expanded into a 20 minute never ending parade of action so utterly absurd it can only be meant as parody. Equally dumb is the chase involving the titular dragon Smaug. Smaug is voiced and motion captured by Benedict Cumberbatch, and is not bad considering he was what the entire trilogy was being sold on! Well animated and a credible 'intelligent' Dragon with impeccable English manners, he plays out his 'in book' scene with Bilbo nicely, then has to take part in a stupid 25 minute 'chase' around the mines in which (A) it is so easy for him to kill his enemies that he literally doesn't bother (B) an over elaborate scheme to fire up furnaces to melt gold to cast a giant statue that will distract Smaug and then melt instantly, drowning him in a lake of boiling gold. No spoiler to say that after all that he just brushes himself off, gets flustered and flies off to 'show them what he does when he's angry!', or rather he will next Xmas because the film ends there! Nice additions to cast include Luke Evans as Bard (now popular revolutionary instead of Captain of the guard) and Stephen Fry as the pompous and self-important town headman, (perfect casting?) as well as Lee Pace making for an equally vain and self-interested Elvin King Thranduil, the slimy isolationist to Tauriel's hardy interventionist.We've had the starter (OK) and the main course (Tolerable) and so now we just have to wait another year for the desert! Can you contain your anticipation?",5,10,20,16 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Starter is finally served...but we're all waiting for the Main Course & Dessert!
","The obvious has already been stated by almost everyone – The book is simply too slim to support a 9 hour movie trilogy and what's more it isn't serious or even 'epic' enough to sustain such a treatment. Then there is the fact that unlike the original LOTR series where each movie corresponded to a particular book, here they have arbitrarily chopped one book up into 3 segments , so each episode is an artificial creation, not the realisation of a particular volume from literature. Plus of course, many more people have read 'The Hobbit' and are thus familiar with it, and since most know it from childhood, they become particularly attached to it, and consequently become less forgiving of messing around with the story and characters.'An Unexpected Journey' arrives with the same hype that 'The Fellowship of the Ring' did 11 years ago, and like 'FOTR' (and even 'The Phantom Menace' 3 years earlier) it has to carry the massive weight of expectations plus a year+ long media and marketing blitz preceding it despite being probably the least consequential of the trilogy and the least interesting or spectacular. Of course how we feel about 'AUJ' will change after 2014 when the cycle is complete and we see it for what it is, Episode 1 of 3, but for now there is the inevitable sensation upon leaving it that 'nothing really happened in that one', with all the good bits yet to come. Also LOTR was the first movie that introduced the idea of the yearly episode, a new phenomenon then in event movies that has been mutated, like 3D, into what is perceived by most filmgoers as a cynical cash-grab used by greedy studios who inflate novels into vast drawn out soufflés to get more ticket revenues and DVD sales, so audiences are less starry-eyed this time around. It's rather like looking forward to a really grand dinner, and getting a decent starter only to be told you will get the main course next year, and the desert a year after that, then another year for the coffee( if you want the 'full version' DVD/Blu-Ray)What of the film itself? Well the actors are all good, and anyone from England will recognise a lot of familiar character actors under the heavy make-up (not least Martin Freeman who no-one ever thought they would see headlining a major blockbuster). Certain parts of the film tie in fairly well with the book, especially the opening party/gathering, the scene with the 3 hungry trolls and of course Bilbo's game of riddles with Gollum (all well known and loved scenes from the book) Faring less well are the Goblins, who are largely brushed aside, though the Goblin King was well done, both in animation and in character, with the great Barry Humphries no less giving him a droll and witty edge. The scene in Rivendell is beefed up as much as similar scenes were in the LOTR adaptations, with a tie in to that trilogy in the form of Galadriel and Sauruman and foreshadowing of the growing Sauron menace. Actually it was interesting to see so many actors from the original series returning here (including older Bilbo and Frodo in a pre-FOTR moment) most of them digitally face-lifted to hide the fact they are all much older now, not alas with very convincing results.The lack of a 'big-bad', with Smaug not even seen yet and 'the Dark One' just a rumour, leads to one major mistake, the creation of an angry Orc king with a personal vendetta against Thorin (He killed Thorin's father and Thorin chopped his arm off), who of course is not in the novel and whose inclusion feels clumsy and cheap, especially since the whole thing is such a cliché and can't avoid coming across as one. He and the Orcs push aside the Goblins and reduce the scene where they hide up trees from the wolves into an overblown symphony of stupidity (even more so when Bilbo suddenly turns into Rambo!) He's still around for the next 2 so that bodes ill.The CGI has come leaps and bounds from the ground-breaking work of the originals, with an even more realistic Gollum, and Orcs that are no longer actors in masks but CGI creations which look suitably other worldly and alien (they even have their own language at last!) The trolls are great, as is the Goblin King, and the massive 'Rock Men'. The 'HFR' format didn't seem to make too much difference, but its effects are probably subliminal, and the 3D was good but not as used as I would have imagined. The fight scenes are jumbled and confused with lots of swirling around and blurry movement that is impossible to follow, something from the original saga that alas has not been improved.So 'AUJ' is a promising start to a new trilogy, but it's just a starter, so don't expect a full course meal because you won't get it. If you loved the book, be prepared for a lot of changes and liberties, because the aim is 2 years down the line to have a 6 movie saga seamlessly blended as a whole.How good will the Main Course be? Guess we'll have to wait until next Christmas to find out!",6,11,24,17 December 2012
Non-Stop," Alfred Hitchcock presents Agatha Christie's Executive Decision! - Pie in the Sky for Neeson's latest.
","Another year another Liam Neeson thriller (usually released between the Jason Statham ones) This year the high concept is 'air marshal threatened by mysterious texter threatening to kill a passenger aboard the transatlantic flight every 20 minutes unless $150.000 is paid into his account. Who is the mystery killer? Who can he trust? What is the bigger picture behind events?' The trailers say it all really, and the whole thing is strictly of a B- movie standard, a Euro-thriller released by a US studio (as in fact are most Neeson movies including 'Taken' and 'Unknown' with whom this shares a director) Apart from Liam and Julianne Moore (who it is great to see back so busy on our big screens) most of the rest of the cast are Brit thespians of high quality, especially the flight crew which is made up of 'Downton Abbey' star Michelle Dockery,'12 yrs a slave' Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, Scoot McNairy and heading them all the wonderful Linus Roache, the RSC headliner who occasionally brightens up movies with his consummate skill. The name of the game is 'guess who?' And to that end we are fed a line up of shifty individuals who may or may not be the mystery attacker/s. Thriller making is rather like Magic and the secret is misdirection and sleight of hand, and director Jaume Collet-Serra does an OK if not spectacular job. Action is naturally limited given the environment but they do use the tightness to create impressive close quarter combat between Neeson and various opponents that would make Steven Segal proud. The special effects are quite ropey though, especially the cartoon airliner and Typhoon fighters which look more like something from a safety information video rather than a major movie!The villains motivations, when revealed, are quite interesting if somewhat lacking in logic, but to their credit they are damaged individuals and so deserving of some pity as well as a pass for their poor scheme! Some have complained about the fact that a Muslim doctor is shown positively while the terrorists this time are not Islamic, but in its defence a real Muslim terrorist would not have gone through all this twisty turny misdirection plot stuff but would simply have blown the plane to bits 10 minutes after take off, which though more realistic frankly wouldn't have made for much of a movie!Reminiscent of those mostly forgotten airliner thrillers from the early- mid 90s, this will doubtless share the same fate but may amuse for now, and Liam Neeson still looks and moves great for a 62 year old! (And Moore isn't so bad either!)PS - Hollywood writers, please please impose a moratorium on using 'I lost a child boo-hoo crying over cute photos and stick drawings' as a substitute for actual characterisation! It drags any movie its used in down and covers it piping hot cheese! Be frakking original, its what you're paid so much to do!",7,0,1,4 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Magnificent Candy Coloured Patisserie that leaves a bitter-sweet taste in the mouth
","Wes Anderson, like the Coens and Spike Jonze among others, operates on what might be termed 'magical realism', a quirky and odd style that is very un-American but which is familiar to European audiences. After 2012's charming Disney-esque children's film 'Moonrise Kingdom' Anderson has returned to his former form with a strange little tale filled with sex (light) violence (occasional but nasty) swearing (lots) and black humour (plentiful) The marketing for this film makes it appear a jolly gay comedy romp, and to some extent it is, but there is also a darker side, a melancholy that comes with the death of a golden age and the sufferings of Eastern Europe under the twin evils of Fascism and Communism, mostly captured in the historical bookends featuring a writer inspired by the Austrian satirist Stefan Zweig (whose tales also inspired this movie) It is also a film about how stories are passed down from one to the other, inspiring new hearts each time (rather like 'Cloud Atlas')Set in a fantasy Ruritanian country called Zubrowka (which is clearly either Hungary or Czechoslovakia) it begins and ends with a girl student in present day Zubrowka admiring a statue of a great national writer whose 1985 book 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' she is reading. We see him in '85 as a mature man (Tom Wilkinson) recounting how he came to know this story as a young man (Jude Law) staying at the decrepit ruin of the once magnificent hotel for his health. Here he meets the owner, the legendary Arab Zero Mustafa (F.Murray Abraham) who is now an impoverished and lonely man. Over dinner her recounts the tale that begins in 1932 when he was a young immigrant lobby boy at the then splendid old GBH under the tutelage of Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) a camp prissy bisexual concierge who is noted for his success with the older ladies that frequent it, something he does for money and prospects but also for pleasure, enjoying the company of these Grande dames from a bygone era of Imperial splendour. One such lady, Madame D. (Tilda Swinton in body foam) becomes nervous and shortly after returning home is murdered. In her will she bequeaths him her most prized possession, the Dutch old school masterpiece 'Boy with Apple' much to the chagrin of her brutish and estranged son Dmitri (Adrian Brody) and his psychopathic henchman Jopling (Willem Defoe), both members of the burgeoning Nazi movement (or 'ZZ fraternity' here) that is straining to take power and achieve 'Anschluss' with its larger neighbour. Egged on by the butler Serge X (Mathieu Almariac) he and Mustafa steal the painting, unaware Serge has hidden a copy of Madame D's secret last will in the back, one which would make them a lot of money and lose Dmitiri everything. Framed for the murder and imprisoned, Gustave gets help from Mustafa and Agatha (Saoirse Ronan) the pretty baker's girl for the legendary Mendels patisserie and his newfound paramour as well as group of cons led by Ludwig (Harvey Keitel) to escape and prove his innocence, pursued doggedly by both Jopling, who is murdering his way through all the leads to get to Serge and by sympathetic police inspector Henckels (Edward Norton) who as a boy was a fond friend of Gustave's during his families summer vacations at the GHB. After much chasing, fighting, shooting, running, hanging out of windows and ledges, disguises and other 'man on the run' tropes, the heroes win.or do they? As this pulp thriller caper was going on, history was turning and the Nazi's have taken power, and to their cost they find that the old imperial splendour and everything it represented has truly gone forever!The look of the film is of course wonderful, with a deliberately artificial candy coloured dreamland version of inter-war Eastern Europe that the Swastika and The Hammer and Sickle eventually crush into drab grey conformity and gloom, complete with cardboard models and sets straight from the German Expressionist movement. The all-star cast on that big poster are good, though some like Bill Murray (another concierge who lends a hand) Own Wilson (another concierge) Lea Seydoux (Madame D's maid) Jason Schwartzman (1985 concierge) and even Wilkinson to an extent are just glorified cameos. The star of the film is Fiennes, a serious actor with a love for comedy who creates a unique and fun spin on his signature foppish persona that's like a gay, self-absorbed gigolo version of Steed from 'The Avengers'. Newcomer Tony Revolori makes a good straight man to this comic buffoon as young Mustafa, while Ronan plays an unusually normal and sweet girl for once. Brody makes for a hateable heavy while Defoe returns to his roots as the 'gorilla' who is genuinely menacing and frightening and gets an appropriately spectacular send off. Keitel is funny and tough in a small but important role, and Jeff Goldblum plays the family lawyer who plays both sides to his cost. Being at heart a sort of Daschle Hammett pulp thriller there are also lots of un-Andersonesque action sequences including a crazy speed of light downhill ski chase (done with models no less) and a final firefight battle inside the GHB between Dmitri's ZZ henchman and Henckle's police. Many have complained about the sombre ending, but that is I suppose the whole point of the story and it is telegraphed from the very start if you look close enough. Still, the 'comic pulp noir Ruritanian' tale at its heart is fun and entertaining if it is mirth and levity alone you seek.PS – Stick around for the animated Cossack who appears dancing to the catchy Balalaika theme during the end credits (3-4 minutes in)",8,2,16,10 March 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Spider man 2 Electro Boogaloo - Memories of flaccid first instalment swept away by powerful and dramatic sequel.
","Sony's first reboot installment in 2012 was justly criticised for being a poorly scripted rehash of Raimi's original a decade earlier, cheap and tacky looking with hardly any spider action and a poorly motivated villain, a chick flick masquerading as a superhero blockbuster existing solely so Sony could maintain the rights. However, in a rare case of people listening, the second movie is a massive step up in quality and integrity which puts to shame most of official Marvel's underwhelming recent offerings.The storyline sticks quite closely to that of the comics (something the original trilogy didn't) and closes many of the loopholes of movie 1 while opening a myriad doors to future instalments.There are four main plot strands here (1) Peter Parker's success as Spiderman and his conflicted feelings about his relationship with Gwen Stacey, especially the vow he made to her dying father, a vow whose casual dismissal now literally haunts him. (2) The succession of Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn to the OSCORP throne and the dirty politics and inherited genetic condition that killed his father and is now starting to blight him too, leading to the desperate search for a cure that seemingly only Spiderman can provide. (3) The tragedy of lonely and ignored OSCORP tech Max Dillon, whose stalkerish obsession with Spiderman after a chance encounter turns deadly when an unlikely industrial accident involving electric eels turns him into 'Electro', a being of living electricity who can drain a city and control a cities fate. (4) The true story of Peter's parents, who on a pre-credit sequence are shown fighting an evil OSCORP assassin in a Learjet and whose motive for running is revealed by some underground detective work. Book ending the movie is a blink and you'll miss it turn by Paul Giamatti as Russian mobster Aleksei Sytseivich, who is recruited to Osborn's 'League of Evil' as 'Rhino' in a mech suit 'Avatar' would envy. But don't get too excited because the film ends just as they are starting to battle!The acting all round is fine. Garfield, criticised for being too cocky last time, is more mature and grounded this time, and his emotional scenes have real power. He is well matched by Dane DeHaan, who has made a career out of troubled angry loners, and gives Osborn enough pathos to make you pity him even as he does awful things. Emma Stone as Gwen is again excellent, funny and intelligent yet hiding a secret pain that's always there in the corner. Jamie Foxx as Dillon makes for both a sad and pitiful loner, desperate to be even acknowledged by anyone, and an increasingly angry and embittered Electro. His 'master plan' involves making the city bow to him and acknowledge his power, which is sad enough in itself. Sally Field again plays a younger, trimmer, more energetic Aunt May, doing some fiery dramatics of her own. Also appearing are Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn, bitter,dying and green, Colm Feore as the shady OSCORP king maker whose more actual villain than either Electro or The Green Goblin, and an unrecognisable Martin Csokas as a stereotypical sadistic German scientist.Unlike TAS, the pacing and the mix of action and drama is far better, and it reaches the emotional and dramatic heights of Raimi's trilogy with actors better suited to the material (You do not want to throttle Stone, unlike the whiny selfish needy Kirsten Dunst! And they have the Parker-Osborn dynamic right here, unlike the Raimi series which switched the original roles around with disastrous consequences.) The special effects are OK but not brilliant, and Electro could have been more ground breaking and breathtaking, but surprisingly it doesn't make too much difference here. Kudos must also be given for following through with a faithful enactment of the Goblin-Gwen Stacey storyline, something of an open secret already, hence the heavy Greek tragedy style foreshadowing throughout the movie. They do not sell it short and it delivers the required emotional punch.A strong superhero movie at a time when such things are increasingly scarce, an astounding step up from the feeble initial instalment that provides fine Summer thrills with a solid dramatic backbone and promises much from director Webb and his team for future episodes.",8,8,20,16 April 2014
Grudge Match," Who would win a fight between Rocky Balboa and Jake La Motta? ...This film won't answer that but you will get a warm 80's style feel good movie
","30 years ago, rival heavyweights Kid McDonaugh and Henry Razor Sharp were bitter rivals, each winning a match. But the great rematch never happened because Sally Rose, Sharp's great love punished his obsession by sleeping with his greatest enemy, giving birth to an illegitimate son which he is kept from. Now, after a punch up between the rivals at a video game motion capture goes horribly wrong, all the world wants a rematch. It means getting back into shape, and facing some old demons which must be put finally to rest if they are to ever find peace.Yes, this is one of those films where you know exactly what is going to happen and how the moment it begins. Yes, it is rather silly and the two big stars are laughing at their own proud filmographies. No, it has no real reason to exist and no, you won't remember it the day after you saw it. It is lightweight fluff, but the question is, is it well made and entertaining fluff?As befits a film starring three stars of the 80's, it has a very Eighties feel to it. The humour is quite tame and respectful and it is unashamedly sentimental and manipulative ( you can predict to a nanosecond when the piano and strings are going to come in) but always keeps on the right side of maudlin and vomit inducing saccharine. There is humour, most of it the obvious ' old guys can't do it so well anymore kind' and easy shots on their former roles as Rocky and LA Motta. Of course after some long overdue training the old guys CAN do it, and better than the youngsters like the arrogant MMA fighter they knock out, or L L Cool J who gets floored in his own gym. However, for the most part its a straight drama (80's style) with obstacles and tests put in the returning champions way like arena challenges from The Hunger Games. Kid has to belatedly get to know the estranged son he had with Sally back in the day ( and his annoyingly cute 8 yr old grandson) while Sharp has to finally face his demons and rekindle his suspended relationship with the now handily widowed Sally, and accept his share of the blame for her vengeful wandering. Then there's Kid's wandering ways and Sharp's partial blindness to contend with too. Naturally the fight goes ahead, though anyone expecting fireworks will be disappointed. This looks exactly like two pensioners slugging it out in boxer shorts, which is as slow, clumsy and frankly disturbing as you would imagine. Of course, having established both the crusties as good guys, you watch wondering how they will deliver the inevitable happy ending for both despite the fact that one has to win and one lose.Acting wise, everyone does their part well. Stallone naturally plays a riff on Rocky, solid blue collar dignity and humble reserve while De Niro is in sleazy drunken womaniser thug LA Motta mode. Basinger, who unlike the others has been notably absent from the big screen, gives Sally a quiet nobility and maturity, and makes us care about her return to Sharp's life and future happiness. Jon Bernthal is equally noble and dignified as Kid's illegitimate son, a sort of better version of his father with all the graces and none of the vices. Alan Larkin, who thank God is still brightening up movies in his dotage, is on sharp wisecracking form as a sort of Mickey mixed with a Borscht-belt comedian, while Kevin Hart, the youngster of the line up, does his usual screechy ghetto wiseass routine as the son of the crooked promoter who engineers the rematch.Don't except a laugh out loud comedy fest nor a hilarious meta satire, nor a tough boxing movie. It's a warm and fuzzy old school feel good pic, and if that's what you're after the this one should please.",7,0,1,29 January 2014
Lincoln," Political portrait that walk a strange line between hard fact and romantic sentiment
","Abraham Lincoln is one of those mythic figures, like Gandhi, El Cid, Che Guevara, Garibaldi, Churchill, Nelson, Washington, Richard the Lionheart, Princess Diana, who have become legends of folklore, legends which usually hide decidedly grubbier and less pleasant realities. However, because of our Human need for heroes to look up to and inspire us, we usually 'print the legend' rather than the truth.Most media representations of 'honest Abe' falls into this latter category, as best exemplified in the literal cartoon that was last year's 'Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter' which brought things into sharper relief by playing it all in deadly earnest. Of course Lincoln lived only a couple of lifetimes at remove from us, so the truth is there, but we choose to ignore it because we want to believe in this great noble hero who 'freed the black man' from the sadistic, demonic evil deformed Southerners, as simple a battle between 'Good' and 'Evil' as the equally misrepresented WWII, a man driven by an all-conquering desire for equality so strong it even has its own stirring accompaniment of tear jerking violins and moving horns wherever it goes! It's a pleasing fantasy, especially for rich white people who like to pat themselves on the back for how noble and good they are, even though it relegates Black people to simpletons, smiling happy children free of any adult sin or virtue, perpetual victims who need nice enlightened white folk to make their destinies for them.I approached this film with some trepidation; sure that Spielberg the great romantic would give us more of the same and then some. However the film walks a very strange tightrope indeed. Taken from D K Godwin's dry text, it spends a lot of time looking at the political machinations and double dealing that got the 13th amendment (banning slavery) passed, and is a highly instructive lesson about how government and democracy actually works, including bribery corruption and outright lies. In turn it has been adapted by playwright Tony Kusher into what is really a filmed play with little real action and everything confined to a few room like sets where dialogue carries everything. This is all then filmed by Spielberg, who injects the admittedly very restrained production with jarring and intrusive stabs of pure schmaltz, usually whenever the evil of slavery is brought up, or one of the many prominently (and highly anachronistically) positioned Black faces steps to make some clichéd speech. These Spielbergian moments can be easily identified because whenever they appear in between the political machinations and congressional double dealings, John Williams stirring flag waving music strikes up to pull those old heartstrings! (You could almost invent a drinking game around them, one that would probably get you very drunk indeed) So really, it's two very separate movies, the Godwin/Kusher political lesson being the biggest, with the Spielberg schmaltz in support.To its credit the film looks authentic, including the dim candle and gaslight level lighting which bathes everything in semi darkness, and most of the characters act, speak and think like people from the 1860s rather than people from 2012 in costume (Save for the aforementioned anachronistic Spielbergian romance moments) both of which are very rare in historical film.This being a stage play in all but name, it is the actors who dominate, and here we have some of the best. Daniel Day Lewis gives us a powerful version of the mythical Lincoln we know and love (rather than the less pleasant real one) with his homespun tales and folksy charm, stirring passion and quiet determination, and he is gifted by an existing physical resemblance. Sally Field creates a powerful character our of Mary Lincoln, the only character to shine a less than positive light on her famous husband, strong willed and frustrated, all too aware of her position as the wife of a legend, a woman who pushes for the 13th largely because it will end the war and keep her son from harm. Tommy Lee Jones incarnates radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, a man too extreme for his time, with the fire of the old TLJ we haven't seen in a while, the brutish, frightening thug like alpha male who can intimidate and crush those beneath him like bugs, the man with the lashing wit and grandiose gestures, and it's nice to see him back again. David Straithern, another powerful presence, plays Lincoln's fixer William Seward. His character is very similar to the one he plays in the 'Bourne' series, the intelligent committed patriotic manipulator who uses downright shady and suspect methods for 'the greater good', expect here we are expected to side with him. His chief agent is played with amoral glee by an almost unrecognisable James Spader, bribing dead duck Democrats with lucrative posts for the 'yes' vote in a series of light hearted vignettes. Jason Gordon Levitt appears as Abe's eldest son Robert, determined to enlist against his father's wishes, whom even a gruesome pit full of severed limbs can't fully dissuade. Legendary Hal Holbrook lends gravitas as voice of reason Preston Blair while Jared Harris effectively incarnates another legend, General Ulysses S. Grant for a few vital scenes.For a Spielberg film about war, there is virtually no action, and those expecting a big spectacular will leave disappointed. This is a history lesson starring famous names written by a playwright adapting a political analyst's dissertation on Congressional politics, directed by the master of romanticism and sentimentality, with a lot of unpleasant truth's airbrushed out and replaced by the legends we would like to believe are actually true in their place. It won't be for all tastes, but it is worth a look for those with a little patience.",7,15,25,13 February 2013
Evil Dead," Evil Dead Serious - No laughs or Irony but plenty of blood and guts
","The trend for making pointless remakes of beloved cult classics of yesteryear has by now become a running joke yet a modestly successful one for cash strapped studios. One might accuse the remakes of just being cheap crap to make money, forgetting that's exactly what most of the originals were in the first place! The difference of course is that the originals were lovingly well made crap, which is why they survived as pulp icons decades after their natural shelf life should have expired.'The Evil Dead' is quite special in this horror pantheon. Notorious upon release for its then unheard of amount of blood, gore and vomit inducing effects – becoming a cause celebre 'Video Nasty' in the UK during the anti-horror moral purge – it was only later acclaimed for the brilliant cinematic work it was. Not only was it made on a shoestring by a near amateur cast and crew, but it mixed its horror with a zany comedy element inspired by 'The 3 stooges' and WB cartoons to create something that had us screaming, hurling, and laughing at the same time. It was film that did not ask to be taken seriously, that knew it was a comedy, yet when the laughs turned to nastiness, they did so twice as hard. The film's creator Sam Raimi has since become an A-list name director who recently gave us Disney's latest blockbuster, while its star Bruce Campbell has become a cult despite a very patchy filmography. Both men, along with co-creator Robert Tapert are the producers of this remake. Directed by Paraguayan newcomer Fede Alvarez, it walks a strange line between a standard remake and homage. Realising that a straight redo was out of the question (especially recasting Campbell's iconic Ash) and furthermore would eliminate all tension if we knew who died when and who would survive, they created a new set of characters, but magnified one – First victim Mia (Jane Levy) Sister of the resident hunk in the 1981 version, she was then simply 'a strange sensitive girl', an artist who felt the evil before everyone else did, and whose hysterical warnings were ignored until she became Demon possessed in the infamous 'tree rape' (a version of which still happens here) and turning into an increasingly scabby monster with a line in cruel playground taunts. Here she becomes a recovering Heroin addict who's just seen her mentally ill mother through her terminal illness and OD twice, who is being 'locked in' the cabin in the woods by her brother and old college pals to make sure she cold turkeys for good. Her relationship with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is 'troubled' and complicated, so already you have soap opera underpinnings, an annoying trend for modern horror which thinks this is the way to make you care about the characters (it doesn't) often to the detriment of any real scares or thrills. It also generates another horror remake sin – Trying to be too earnest and serious! The originals had a wink in their eye and tongue firmly in cheek, they knew they were crap and had a good time trying to scare you. Not so the remakes, which seem to aiming for some form of Oscar worthy high art and ending up simply dull and un-engaging. This is especially true of 'Evil Dead' because of its horror-comedy nature. Other details are changed. The 'Necromicon' book of the dead still exists, but it is no longer Sumerian, is filled with comic book illustrations and big red graffiti telling everyone what is going to happen next, and is linked to European Satanic worship and the Devil. The dreaded words of activation – pilfered from 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' – are also different, and are read out by one of the party rather than on the tape recorder. The possessed no longer turn into monsters, and have to resort to idiotic self-mutilation practices (as illustrated in comic book Necromicon) to look suitably nasty. Also a 'deadite' can be restored to normal life once freed, though it seems logically impossible.As with all drastic reinterpretations, some little nods are thrown to fans, starting with the classic Oldsmobile appearing as a derelict in the grounds, then the 'Raimi zooms', especially during the zany construction in the shed scene(a defibrillator rather than weapon here) and a final battle involving a chainsaw that also ends up on the end of lone survivors severed wrist. And of course the film's ground-breaking gore is reproduced, but by now buckets of blood, gore, severed limbs, pulped dogs, nail and knife riven corpses, people sawn in half and slimy gruel are not that shocking. What in the original came off as glorious overkill here just becomes tedious overkill, but at least they tried.So this is essentially a 'serious' spin on the same scenario, more homage than remake, never living up to the original but not insulting it either. This is clearly meant to be another story being told, which could even be read as a dream, a psychological manifestation of one character literally beating their demons, highlighted by a fleeting appearance by Ash/Campbell at the end of the credits with his 'Groovy!' catchphrase. The original series is safe, and could even be returned to if the makers so wish. As far as unnecessary remakes go, this could have been worse, even though it has no real reason to exist. Faint praise indeed, but considering the field, still praise.",7,4,18,19 April 2013
Mama," Spirit raised by Girls raised by spirit punks punky Chastain in creepy custody battle from Hell!
","Mexican director Guliermo Del Toro is increasingly going the way of Tarantino and Besson, taking promising young talents under his wing and nurturing them into a stable of likeminded auteurs. This is one such project, directed by unknown Andres Muschietti based on his 5 minute short of the same name.The film, from its trailer and marketing, appears to be yet another in the endless production line of 'Look behind you-family in peril from unseen things and sinister shadows-fade to black shock 'What are you? What do you want?-scary noises' identikit horrors, but it is actually refreshingly far from the usual cookie cutter mould.Inspired by the cold, cerebral Horror-Sci-fi of the 1970s ('Silent Running' gets a notable name drop) and blended with the more modern strain of tragic ghost stories from Japan, Korea and of course Del Toro himself, the film has a very interesting premise, and even more unusual execution.Starting with a story ripped from our own headlines, we follow a desperate father, bankrupted in the 2008 crash, killing his associates and wife, before taking his 2 infant daughters to die with him in a suicide murder. But taking refuge in the woods, these victims of modern tragedy encounter the ghostly victim of an earlier one, Edith Eames, a Victorian Downs Syndrome sufferer who gave birth in an asylum (we can imagine how she got pregnant..) but wouldn't give up her baby and ran off with it, jumping to her death off a high cliff pursued by locals. Though looking rather ghastly (apart from her condition she is also broken and bent by the fall and rotted by the river water) and having a very scary way of moving, including going through walls and floors, Edith is no villain and takes care of the two girls, raising them as her own as best she can, until they are found 5 years later by their uncle, comic book artist Lucas (Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau) and his punk rocker girlfriend Annabel (an unrecognisable 'Gothed up' Jessica Chastain) and taken into their custody. Feral, wild, barely able to speak, and in constant communion with Edith, who they have simply taken to calling 'Mama', they excite the interest of psychiatrist Dr Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash as a typical cold hearted, untrustworthy, science before human beings 1970s horror shrink) Dreyfuss puts the skid row pair in a fancy mansion to study the kids dynamic, but quickly realises there are parapsychological forces at play, and tracks Edith's history and past down. With Edith becoming increasingly angry and jealous at the interlopers, it soon becomes a custody battle from Hell, with the two girls, Victoria and Lilly, increasingly divided in loyalty. Victoria, the older one who remembers her past life, gravitates towards Annabelle and a return to normality, but younger Lilly, who has only ever known Edith, sticks strongly to her ghostly adopted mother no matter what.The 'monster' Edith/Mama is, as you might gather, rather more sympathetic than the usual angry spirits of the genre. Although horrific, and capable of murder (though in defence of her adopted children, and only killing unpleasant characters) she is motivated by love and the need to love, a need she was denied 140 years before. She is a sort of amalgam of 'The Woman in Black', the protective ghost of Irena in 'Curse of the Cat People' and Tim Burton's 'Corpse Bride'. She provides plenty of scares, usually popping up in corners or behind doors just in the angle of the frame for that 'shudder' effect, and is well rendered and delivers the nightmare chills we expect, but to their credit Muschietti and Del Toro give her the pathos and understanding such a character deserves. This is especially true of the films controversial and much derided ending. Rather than concluding everything with violence and Sturm und Drang, they follow through the story that has preceded it and give us a resolution that is apt and lyrically poetic, (similar in many ways to the endings of 'The Corpse Bride' and 'The Matrix' trilogy) which is more likely to jerk tears than raise hairs. The die-hard Horror fans may naturally feel short changed, but it is a beautiful and moving final note, showing the film's Latin origins over the usual blood and guts practicality of the Anglo tradition.Acting wise, the ever rising Jessica Chastain excels once again, barely recognisable in her punky Goth get up, but beneath the cliché rock band chick is a beating human being, one who responds to the situation thrust upon her as best she can. Again, whereas an Anglo-American film would thrust Annabelle's new found maternal position down our throats with the old disingenuous 'a woman's true happiness' line, here she grows to love the girls through simply being with them, without ever becoming 'a mom'. She sympathises with Edith's plight, and does not try to make herself out to be 'the better mother'. As her boyfriend Lucas (and his homicidal twin from the intro) 'Game of Thrones' hunk Waldau gives a balanced and natural persona, someone who like Annabelle is trying to make the best of a bad situation. Kush is also good as the 1970s style sinister man of science, though he too remains sympathetic despite his generic role.All in all 'Mama' delivers more than the trailers promise, with solid acting, a nice retro style, real chills and horrible thrills, an original storyline and a pathos filled, lyrical sadness that elevates it to a higher artistic plain. Just remember to bring some handkerchiefs for the finale!",9,2,5,3 March 2013
Jack Reacher," You've heard this one before a hundred times, but the secrets in the way you tell it..
","The gruff loner who rides in, cleans up town then rides off again, the spunky heroine who ends up a damsel in distress, the innocent man framed for a crime he didn't commit, sinister cover ups, a ruthless 'cattle baron' after his own version of manifest destiny backed up by his smiling killer Right-Hand man whose deadly pissing contest with the hero ends in a mano-a-mano under the pouring rain, an apparently random massacre designed to take out one specific target, a parlour game of 'guess the traitor' from a list of equally shifty authority figures, the salty old Indian fighter who can still fire a rifle real good, the tart with a heart of gold who comes out for the hero in the end,bullet spattered final battles in a night time quarry. Car chases, fist fights, shoot outs, foot chases, every Thriller/Western cliché is present and correct here. Based on one of Lee Child's popular pulp novels, it's a mixture of very old and familiar ingredients, nothing new or original here at all. However the real power of a joke, song or story is in the way you tell it and that is where the film's real strength and pleasure lie.Christopher McQuarrie moulds what could have been just another generic thriller of the week into an entertaining and gripping ride down this familiar territory with real class and style. One key to its power lies in its deliberate retro vibe, taking all its cues from the tough mean thrillers of the 1970s. Right from the chilling opening sniper sequence (evoking similar moments in films like 'Dirty Harry' and 'Two Minute Warning') to the extended car chase between a Chevy Chevelle and an Audi RS6 through a deserted city centre with no music save the revs and the tyre squeals, through the minimal strings and bass score, down to the 'natural justice' code of the hero who lives by a definite morality that exists beyond niceties like law and evidence and includes summary execution and vicious beating of wrong doers, it takes us back to a harsher, crueller time where brutality, hopelessness and nihilism was done with effortless style. In fact it is just the sort of movie John Frankenheimer might have made now had he not passed onto the great beyond.Tom Cruise has been criticised for 'not being the character in the books', and that may be true, but he uses his film star power in the same way Clint Eastwood, Burt Reynolds, Charles Bronson and their contemporaries did back in the 70s to ground a movie in just their presence, distracting us from the sometimes unpalatable and even overtly Fascistic things they do with their easy charm and store of goodwill. Cruise has played tough guys before, and though he may not be the Schwarzeneggerian figure of the novels, he is a good enough fit. It's nice to see the lovely Rosamund Pike headlining another major movie after last years 'Wrath of the Titans', having been a fan of hers since her fresh from drama school breakout in 'Die Another Day' ten years ago, and I hope we'll be seeing more of her soon. Though not spectacular, she makes a good heroine and co-protagonist here. Richard Jenkins as her father is also good (another actor who lights up a movie) as is David Oyelowo as the cocky detective in charge of the investigation. Jay Courtney makes for a fine strong right hand, cruel and cold blooded in the service of his master, and physically menacing as well, he is a perfect antagonist for our Nietzschian hero. Alexia Fast as the tart with the heart of gold is memorable, both sexy and vulnerable, you end up caring for her fate. The strangest casting call is of course the legendary director Werner Herzog, who's 'cattle baron' villain is cruel but also very wounded. In keeping with the current trend, he is not evil per se but made what he is by the cruelty and horror inflicted upon him, having turned himself into a man of ice in order to survive the Soviet concentration camps in Siberia, and thanks to Herzog we can still see the soul buried beneath the snow.The film, as you would expect is very violent and brutal, and it can only have been Cruise's star weight that got the movie a PG-13/12a certificate given that is on a par with any of the 'Lethal Weapon' series. Avoid if squeamish (saw a few eyes covered up in the audience) and don't bring the little ones!There are many more Reacher novels, making this a potential franchise spinner for Cruise to go alongside his long running 'Mission Impossible' series. Though he may be considered a fascist vigilante by many, Reacher is the sort of hero we look to in these troubled, frightening times, strong, uncompromising, who does 'the right thing' by bypassing all those fussy little niceties like rights, law and civilized values!",8,3,7,9 January 2013
Les Misérables," The Grand made Small - Unlike the Book or the Opera, this is NO Epic!
","This review presupposes knowledge of the book and the musical. If you don't know the story at all, then there are big spoilers below!150 years ago Victor Hugo wrote a huge novel that was grand in scope and powerful in its emotions, moving readers as few books had before.25 years ago a new form of 'modern opera' was created, birthing a blockbuster show that was grand and emotionally powerful, which sent audiences the world over home in tears.Now Tom Hooper has taken them both and made them small, weak and mediocre. The characters have the same names and the storyline is the same, but there is no heart, no soul, nothing to care about.I managed to read the whole book (eventually!) and soon after went to see the London production of 'Les Mis' in 1997, which overwhelmed me so much I had to be taken by my wife to see 'Tomorrow Never Dies' midnight show at the ODEON Leicester Square to recover! When I saw the trailers and the hype preceding this movie adaptation, I was expecting something grand and epic, both physically (the story could be really opened out on film the way a stage show couldn't) musically (the score done in dolby digital multiple surround) and emotionally. Instead what we saw was a bland BBC production in which 85% of the movie is done in tight close ups of people literally just pacing around or sitting down! This was clearly either to hide the miniscule sets, which seem even more limited than the stage versions, or a botched attempt to do what cannot be done on stage, get literally 'in their faces'. Either way, it doesn't work. Also many of the numbers are seriously truncated, and events speeded up. True, this is necessary for film, but again it was badly botched, killing tension, character development and pathos as well as rhythm. The book/opera's many moments of emotional power are treated in such a glib and offhand manner that they become just trivial details. Jean Valjean's conversion to good, Fantine's fall from grace, young Cosette's pain, all get a light brushing over. They even managed to destroy Eponine's death, one of the most crushing and suffocating moments in musical theatre, which is unforgivable. Indeed, Eponine herself gets a noticeably short shrift in this production, (even her ghost is notably absent in the final scene) perhaps because Samantha Barks who beautifully plays her is showing up the other headline players, notably Amanda Seyfried, who is as bland and anodyne here as elsewhere, and so has to be shoved aside! Her parent's Mr and Mrs Thernandier are turned from the wicked scum of the book/musical into literal cartoon characters, and in their final scene at Marius' wedding they leave almost as heroes the audience is meant to be siding with. Where is the well-deserved vicious moral lashing they receive in the stage version? Shoved aside too so we can love those wacky bastards some more! The 'empty chairs empty tables' song was done literally, with Marius sitting alone in a room with empty chairs and tables! Where are the stirring memories of his fallen comrades that we see in the book and the stage show surrounding him? It's in the text alone because we sure as Hell never see them.It's hard to rate the performances since most of the cast are there for star power rather than singing power, even though most have some sort of musical background. No one is tuneless, but there is no energy, no drive, and no drama in their performances. Only Anne Hathaway manages to inject some little life into her character, but frankly you'd have to be really bad if you couldn't wring any pathos out of Fantine so it isn't saying much. In a work that functions entirely on drama and emotion, the lack of it is going to kill a production stone dead.As I said before, I cried reading the book, and I cried at the show. Here I felt nothing, nothing at all. Many have written here saying likewise. Take from that what you will.",5,2,6,28 January 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Here we go again - Cruise cruises through Video Game pseudo-movie with Emily becoming a Blunt instrument and Liman lending a Light touch.
","Another year another Tom Cruise mind-frakk Sci-Fi puzzle picture with a top androgynous Brit actress! After last year's pleasing though not universally admired 'Oblivion' now comes 'Edge of Tomorrow', based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel and directed by Doug Liman, author of the original 'Bourne Identity' 'TBI' was a very different movie to the two Greengrass sequels, more gay-spirited, lightweight romantic Euro-adventure than the dark, oppressive and more politically oriented films that followed and this film is very much in that tradition. It is a light, fun, breezy film that wants to take you on a crazy ride and have a good time getting there and that's it. The setup is simple enough. Yet another alien invasion threatens the Earth after a meteorite/troopship hits Germany and squiggly luminous polip-lion creatures are taking over Europe just as the Germans and Italians did in WWII (No subtlety at all here) Humanity responds with mini-mech suited legions and plans a great beach landing at Normandy (still no subtlety!) Slick PR guy Major Cage (Cruise) manages to pees off General Brigham (Brendon Gleeson) and ends up press ganged into the landings where he dies in the act of killing an 'Alpha', the blue hued officer class of the alien hoard with a direct link to their leader 'The Mind'. However he wakes up at the same point on the same day and finds himself repeating the same thing every time, yet learns by his mistakes and survives longer every time and becomes a better soldier as a result. Then he meets the Allies star warrior, Rita Krasinsky (Buffed and Womaned-up Emily Blunt) who had experienced a similar thing herself before her great victory at the decisive battle of Verdun (Subtlety totally absent!) Turns out Cage has inherited the powers of the Alpha, who is an avatar of The Mind and can 'reset time' once killed so it can have the strategic edge over its enemies every time.So the two team up and try to get to the 'boss level' Mind, getting a little further every time until they are tricked by false visions into a trap. Only way to locate The Mind now is to obtain the top secret device invented by wacky MOD scientist Dr Carter (Noah Taylor) which involves some 'Mission Impossible' shenanigans at Whitehall during which Cage is injured and gets a blood transfusion which robs him of his 'time reset' powers as it did Krasinsky. Now very mortal, the duo recruit the rough jarheads of J- Squad on a Dirty half-Dozen mission to Paris to take out The Mind by any means necessary.As this précis suggests, Sakurazaka's story is very much a gamer universe with the 'fight-die-repeat-get better-advance through the levels till you reach boss level' reality of most console adventures and it is no surprise to learn that Sakurazaka's background was as a games designer. So what we have in effect is a film that plays like a game, instead of the endless movies based on games that don't, capturing perhaps for the first time the actual experience of gameplay. Of course it could have been fun to go beyond the actual narrative parameters of the story and have the character discover they were part of two universes, their own and that of 'the users', as we saw in 'Tron' and 'The Lego Movie', with the ensuing existential angst and metaphysical dilemmas, but that would have been another movie altogether. Liman is happy to play along with the concept and let it roll. Of course being so different to the traditional narrative structure yet without any extra dimensions or allusions it risks tiring an audience and wearing out their patience, so you have to know what you are going to get if you want to avoid disappointment. The acting is not splendid but functional. Cruise nicely essays the journey from douche to hero better than most (those are his two set personas anyway so with either he is still in his comfort zone) but he is never stretched or taxed. Same goes for Emily Blunt, who has been to the gym and got herself a hard body which she shows off through wife- beater vests in a way that would make even Michelle Rodriguez proud. Of course someone like Rodriguez would have been a more natural first choice for this role, so it is brave casting to go for the normally very petite and elegant Blunt, who is however no stranger to odd-sci-fi. The two do not exactly have much of a chemistry, but given the situation and the whole 'wartime' milieu, it is perhaps intentional. Gleeson does his part well as does Bill Paxton as the hard ass Sargent. No mystery why he was cast, though sadly he never says 'Game Over' (Too obvious?) The rest are familiar character actors playing tough Space Marines and are never meant to rise above pure stereotype.Action wise we see the same impressive aerial landing and beach battle (the one in the trailers) many times, and there is a nice 'ruined city' fight at the end, but none are THAT spectacular and after you've seen them again for the thirtieth time (including the trailers) they begin to lose their lustre. Special Effects are also OK but nothing extraordinary. The look of the movie is very much 90's, and that is probably down to Liman (or a tight budget) London gets to do Blockbuster duty again with Trafalgar Square, Waterloo Bridge and Whitehall all getting a pounding.The second time travel 'change the future by replaying the past' summer flick after 'X-Men Days of Future Past', it pales a little in comparison but is still easy and original fun (If you forget 'Groundhog Day' and 'Source Code' of course) if that is what you seek for a night out.",8,1,3,1 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Fear and Loathing on Wall Street - The Alphas have it in Scorseses controversial comic take on Financial high piracy.
","In the fantasy novel 'The Blade of Justice', the warlike pirate Ganoolite raiders have a religion whose main sutra states 'Life belongs to those strong enough to live it. Weakness is born to be crushed while those born with strength will thrive. Strength in unity! Strength in comradeship!' In many ways Belfort and his 'raiders' resemble them a great deal, and the Ganoolite mantra might not just be theirs, but of the film itself.Imagine what a screwball comedy written by Ayran Rand might look like, and you have a pretty good idea of 'The Wolf of Wall Street', a highly fictionalised and romanticised account of the life and times of infamous crooked bonds dealer Jordan Belfort. Scorsese has, to his great credit, never been one to condemn or judge, but to sit back and observe the power play and rules of the game of the enclosed and exotic worlds he peers into, whether it is the Cosa Nostra or Victorian society, Tibetan monks or Civil war era New York. There are no real villains in his world, for even the darkest and most vicious human being is shown to have a soul and a personal code, and it is perhaps for this reason that his films have been so consistently refreshing and rich.That rule applies here, as Belfort and his financial 'raiders' defy the beliefs of both right and left, strive for nothing but the gratification of their own needs, and rob many people rich and poor of great sums of money to pay for them. They would be out and out villains in any other film or book, (just as the cast of 'Goodfellas' or 'Casino' would in most conventional thrillers) but Scorsese has again turned the picture around 180 degrees so we see it from their viewpoint. The film's message seems to be that in any world and any time there will be the 'Alphas', the men and women who are stronger, smarter, more capable, then there will be the rest. No matter where they start off, these 'Alphas' will rise to the top and dominate the others because that is their natural destiny in the Evolutionary cycle. In other times and societies, they would be bandits, pirates, raiders, war bands, but in American capitalism they are Wall Street hustlers. They behave like pirates, celebrating their natural superiority and engaging in ever more insane and dangerous acts of machismo and bravado to show they do not live by the same fear and apprehension of their inferiors. They worship their war leader Belfort with almost fanatical devotion, aware he has taken them from the gutter into the stars, and he in turn is protective of his war band, seeing in each and every one of them the same spark of brilliance he possesses. Around this ever growing band of 'Alphas' are the inferiors, such as the dim recruits who fail the 'sell me a pen' test, the limp wristed Gay butler who is caught with his hand in the till, the weedy would be raider who cleans his fish tank on a big day, or the superficial shoe designer roped in for a scam, or Belfort's slutty trophy wife Naomi, and even to an extent eager FBI agent Patrick Denham (the hero in most other accounts but here almost a destructive inhibitor of natural selection). They are humiliated and denigrated, shown to be weak and valueless besides the Alphas. Like it or not this is a true fact and it is a brave author indeed who dares propose it in these times, especially using a relatively recent true life story to tell it.'TWOFWS' is however quite un-Scorsese like in its style, which is blackly comic and defiantly un-PC. In many ways it resembles last years 'Pain and Gain', though even less judgemental and even more applauding of its characters vices. There are laugh out jokes aplenty of various styles and kinds, including a post marriage bliss scene between Belfort an Naomi that seems ripped from the 1930s screwball comedies so beloved of the film historian. The heavy use of drugs is also made light of, and the comedy veers from 'Cheech and Chong' territory to one extended scene which comes straight out of Gilliam's 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' (another film this recalls) featuring an accidental overdose of heavy duty pills, a Lamborghini and Popeye. However there are also some dark moments, the darkest of which is the breakdown of the Belfort's marriage, where neither party exactly covers themselves in glory and the screaming child between them is the confused terrified victim (hope they used clever editing for that?)Technically the film is great, with good cinematography and music (as you would expect) and the acting all round is top grade. De Caprio evokes compassion and support for someone who should not have it, Jonah Hill continues his rise, bringing his comedy skills into the mix, Margot Robbie excels as Naomi., likable and hateable at once, and Kyle Chandler plays the FBI straight arrow well, teetering between hero and villain. Also of note are Matthew McConaguhey who plays the wall street broker that teaches young Jordan the ropes and conveys the film's whole message in his Native American style 'war chant' before and after a 'raid'. 'The Artist' Jean Dujardin plays a slimy Swiss banker, Rob Reiner plays Belfort Senior, and the UK's national treasure Joanna Lumley is Naomi's sexy older lady aunt.This is not a film for everyone, but it is a brave one, and an extremely funny and entertaining one for those with 'the strength to live it.'",9,2,5,22 January 2014
Dark Shadows," Big Budget and technical excellence serve a lack of ambition- the original in reverse!
","Finally, after all the waiting, the movie is finally here. Now that we have it, what can we make it of it? The original was unintentionally funny in the way that many shows of its time (Star Trek-Dr Who-Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, etc.) were while maintaining an air of deadly earnestness, a combination that won it many fans. In a way it epitomised the 'Ed Wood' syndrome that Burton and Depp so lovingly homage 17 years ago, a clash between grand intent and woeful lack of means/ability. The trailer made the film look like an all-out comedy, which it actually isn't. It attempts to take itself seriously most of the time, while throwing in some very broad and generic humour, and as many have pointed out the two here do not gel. There is no dramatic tension or irony created by the horror side by side with the comedy, no chiaroscuro contrasts, they simply sit side by side awkwardly, like a classical musician playing Mahler suddenly breaking out into rap then going back to Mahler! Perhaps if it had been done as an all-out absurdest comedy it might have worked better. Failing that, if it had been played deadly seriously, as the original was, there would have been the potential for plenty of real drama, pathos and power, the sort that Burton used to be able to find in movies like 'Batman' 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Sleepy Hollow'. As it is the movie is not funny enough to be a comedy, it isn't dramatic enough to be an engaging emotional tale, and it isn't dark or frightening enough to count as genuine horror either. It tries to be all things and ends up being none of them. The film is admirable in its attempts to squeeze in as much of the original series as it can, even if most of it is of the strictly name check variety. However even these plot lines are changed for the worst. Take the origin story in the 1760s. In the original, Barnabas is a fool who professes love for Josette yet happily betrays her with Angelique, and is thus the main author of his own downfall. Here it's made to look as if Angelique does all the lusting, long before Josette ever turns up, thereby eliminating much of the tragedy and moral ambiguity in favour of a simple 'good vs Evil' narrative. Also Barnabas' presentation to the modern Collins family, wonderfully creepy in the original, with its tones of 'Dracula', the mysterious foreigner entering their midst, a man with centuries on his shoulders, the 'call of the blood', the whole enigma of the portrait, here simply becomes Barnabas walking in to the home in 1760s regalia making no secret of who or what he is, making an instant pact with Elizabeth based on money for aid. It has no power, no mystery, no drama, and it does nothing but turn Barnabas into a one note comic character. The 'falling in love with the girl who looks like Josette' storyline is played out well enough, with original narrator Victoria Winters actually being Maggie Evans before a name change, therefore combining both characters and their near identical story lines with Barnabas into one. The ghost of Josette, (the first ever supernatural element of the original series) here haunts not Collinwood but Victoria, and the film is never quite clear whether Maggie/Victoria is actually the reincarnation of Josette, or merely a 'sixth sense' child whom the ghost latches onto in order to fulfil a destiny. Both possibilities are shown, and since Maggie and Victoria were neither, simply mistaken as such by Barnabas because of their looks, we are left to figure out for ourselves. Everything is wrapped up in an explosive finale which would be exciting and original if it wasn't almost identical to the ones in 'Witches of Eastwick' 'Death Becomes Her' ' Stardust' 'The Wolfman' and several others besides. Here Burton throws in a bag of other plot points, with the 'Collins curse Werewolf' and the ghost of David's mother/Phoenix popping up out of nowhere to help deliver a sucker punch to baddie Angelique. You almost expect Quentin Collins, Reverend Trask or Count Petofi to burst out of the floor to take part, but I guess Burton is saving those for the sequel, along with Julia Hoffman, who alas here suffers the same truncated fate as her character did in the 1970 movie (in the series, after a rocky start she becomes Barnabas' right hand woman and greatest friend) but then it seems she too will return for the possible sequel. So the film itself is entertaining, featuring great actors and moody set design, but it suffers from the reverse of the 'Ed Wood' syndrome of its famed inspiration. Here it is great means, ability and talent put to the service of an unambitious exercise in water treading. As a nights entertainment it is great, but with the names 'Dark Shadows' and 'Tim Burton' attached, it cannot help but leave you with a sense of disappointment and a longing for what could have been.",6,6,13,11 May 2012
Prometheus," 'Casino Royale' for the Alien franchise - New direction but 80% of what makes the fun is missing
","We saw this film last night at a special midnight 'premiere' at our local multiplex, with a packed crowd of Sci-fi and 'Alien' fans. The tension and excitement was high. At the beginning the manager introduced the film but warned it 'wasn't like Alien'. 2 hours later the mood was quite ugly, as if a riot was about to break out, mainly because 'it wasn't like Alien' This film suffers from the same problem all big hits do. They become so popular that they are then endlessly rehashed; to the point that people complain it's too formulaic and always the same. But when the creators then try to change it, or go in a different direction, the work is attacked for 'not being 'X' or 'Y' enough'. In many ways 'Prometheus' is like 2006's 'Casino Royale' – A back to basics origin story that lacks 80% of what made the series so popular, with a few little hints and name checks dropped here and there so that it can be said to be a 'Bond' film even though it doesn't feel like one. So here we have effectively a re-run of the very first 'Alien' – a near identical spaceship goes off to a distant planet, encounters an abandoned extra-terrestrial ship, finds something evil inside, crew is decimated, lone girl survives. However this one has NO ALIEN creature (save for one in the final moments) stalking the crew. Instead we have a couple of genetic mutations that might turn into Xenomorphs later, but look like zombies, some tentacle creatures, a 'body-hugger' (pre- miniaturisation facehugger) and the 'Engineers'. The 'Engineers' are the films big new idea, the old Dannekin 'Chariot of the Gods' extra- terrestrials that made/educated mankind, though they have been done so many times now in modern sci-fi that they are an immediate cliché. They are what were formerly called 'Space Jockeys', that bizarre, disturbing creature piloting the crashed ship in 'Alien' whose ossified corpse was one of the film's lasting mental images. Like Boba Fett, it was a throwaway background thing that took on a life of its own and was eventually granted an official backstory in the prequel. However, like Boba Fett, the official backstory is dull and kills all mystique. Turns out that strange, Elephant like creature we all tried to imagine as a living thing of flesh over those bones was just a spacesuit! Inside was a large white muscly man modelled on Mark Strong, our human progenitors no less, not exactly what we all secretly wanted to hear. They are a sort of 'angel' who created mankind, but now seek to destroy, or supplant, us with the Xenomorph. 'Why?' becomes the big question that propels the film's main heroine, Elizabeth Shaw, played by Noomi Rapace, a scientist who also has a strong Christian faith which directs her research. Contrary to popular myth, a good percentage of scientists are also religious, indeed science itself has always been fed by the religious impulse, and it is very refreshing to see faith not be treated with cheap contempt in a modern film. Shaw is the film's Ripley, though her toughness is of the interior rather than exterior kind: No weapons blasting or Alien fighting for her, rather it is the strength of her character and ideal that make her our heroine., and which lead her to continue her quest into the expected sequels. Michael Fassbender is excellent as the android David, though even he eventually proves to be less instrumental to the story than we first imagined. Charlize Theron is wasted as the slimy corporate type, as is Idris Elba as the jovial ship's captain. The rest of the cast barely make an impression, the total opposite of the usual ensemble cast of Alien films, and it isn't even clear who dies when and how. The special effects and the 3-D is brilliant, and makes the film a pleasing visual experience, rather like a large art instillation, but what the film lacks is narrative drive. It is as if they had taken the first part of the original Alien, then left out the second and third acts, making it the story of a group of people who land on a strange planet and find something, with a little bit of running around at the end. 'Alien' motifs are deliberately dropped in to remind us we are watching one, like the opening conference (Aliens) the landing on LV233 (Alien) searching the Gigersque ship (Alien) Metal vials laid out like eggs (Alien) refusing the infected return (Alien) seeking safety in a pod then attacked (Alien 1-4) and the final radio message of hope (Alien 1- 4), but they are done so deliberately that they strike false, just namedrops to keep the fans happy. 'Prometheus' tries to return to the pre-Star Wars sci-fi tradition that spawned the original film, the sci- fi of ideas and philosophy, big questions asked out there in the last unknown, but all it does is ask questions it then doesn't answer, saving those for sequels of the 'to find out tune in next week!' variety. It takes out the Xenomorphs, the horror, the action, the chase, but puts nothing in their place. It is both a very bold film, for its ideas themes and visual splendour, but it is also not an 'Alien' film, and not a very exciting or frightening one either, and it sets up answers we never get. It is definitely a film to see in a large cinema, and a pleasant experience, but radically alter your expectations or you will be like that riot mob last night baying for Ridley Scott's head!",7,9,15,1 June 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Busy, rushed and a little Generic but still a very winning and fun film as Lightning strikes twice, even if not in the same place!
","Saw this at a midnight premiere in the UK.Thor, like Iron Man, is a Marvel comics stalwart who is now world famous largely thanks to the recent movie series. The first instalment was a very unusual comic book film, being part Earthbound fish out of water comedy and part intimate family drama in the lofty heights of Asgaard, a labour of love from distinguished Shakespearian Kenneth Brannagh, whose main purpose was to introduce most of the key players and plot drives for the upcoming 'Avengers' movie. That has now come, been seen and conquered, so now comes the second stand alone. Without another movie to set up, and without Brannagh at the helm, it is a more conventional sort of 'superhero' movie, with a nefarious enemy at the head of a literally faceless army and huge blade shaped spaceships intent on universal Armageddon via a newly introduced super McGuffin weapon that must be stopped at the last second, etc. It does however boast (A) lots of spectacular action, and more importantly (B) all the original cast returning, now old friends riding on the love they've earned in the previous 2 movies.The story concerns the 'Dark Elves', who existed before the known Universe of the tree of life was created and who want things back to how they used to be (dark) before these pesky 'light' beings came about. (That is their only motivation) Defeated eons ago by Asgard, their super weapon, the Aether, a red hued dark matter polip, was buried somewhere where it could never be found: the London borough of Greenwich, Earth! And who but Thor's love interest and most annoying physicist ever Jane Foster (Portman) with her wisecracking sidekick Darcy (Kat Dennings) and her own personal male understudy in tow should stumble upon it during their inter-dimensional research? The stuff is causing weird phenomena to happen, since the 9 realms are entering into their 5,000 year 'alignment', the only time the Aether can be used to destroy all, and the stuff enters Portman Venom style and makes her its doomed human host. Thor (Hemsworth) who meanwhile has been leading the clean-up of the 9 realms (Asgaard is still the universe's policeman) is alerted and takes the opportunity to whisk the love of his life back to Asgaard so she can get treated. Father Odin (Hopkins) who is not too hot on him having a mere 'human' bride anyway refuses to have her in the city, and with good reason since it provokes an attack from the newly resurgent dark elves led by their leader Malakeith (Christopher Eccleston) using the old 'get yourself captured then attack from within' strategy and soon Asgaard is ablaze in a Star Wars style space fighter battle between Elf blade ships and Asgaardian fighters (which look like little Viking ships with wings!) and an assault on the palace which inflicts many casualties, and slaying in battle Odin's beloved wife Frigg (Rene Russo) Driven mad by rage, Odin plans to use Jane to tempt the elves back so he can wipe them all out. Thor on the other hand, now voice of reason (1st movie 360 degrees) and not wanting to lose his beloved, conspires with guardian Heimdall (Elba) and his 4 companions (Alexander, Stevenson, Levi and Asanabou) to launch an elaborate jail break that springs both Jane and the now imprisoned Loki (Hiddleston), himself in despair for the loss of his beloved foster mother, to get the Aether out of Jane and stop the dark elves using the alignment. What follows is another fighter battle through Asgaard, lots of post-Avengers Thor and Loki bonding and bickering, the springing of the now mentally unstable post-Avengers Dr Erik Selvig (Skaarsgard) from a mental institution, and a series of increasingly confusing and downright surreal encounters with Malakeith and the elves as they fall through various dimensions and time zones, ending up with the Elf ship embedded in Greenwich's famous naval academy and museum where the last battle for life as we know it takes place, with all players, Human and Asgaardian on the ball.As you might gather from that précis, there is a lot of plot here that happens very fast, perhaps too fast. There is also lots of sci-fi action involving exotic fighter dogfights and laser battles between medieval fashioned armies in classical architecture that makes one feel he is watching a 'Star Wars' prequel a lot of the time (especially with Portman around). However the film manages to include the two winning elements of Thor 1, the unique dramatic character interplay between the tortured Asgaardian elite and perfectly timed comedy, mostly thanks to the Dennings-Skaarsgard-Portman crowd but with Thor, now no longer a stranger on Earth, being perhaps too at ease in Midgard, such as when he hangs up his hammer on a coat stand, or follows 007 in taking our London Underground during a mission. The direction by Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor is fine, and the acting all round is superb. One feels sorry though for Eccleston, who is meant to be the big villain but is mostly one note and generic, and not only has half his face blown off midway to become 'Harvey two-elf' for no real reason but also seems to have lost a lot of his screen time too. The London locations (especially Greenwich) are again fun for us Londoners, after 007 and FnF set their latest adventures here.If there are drawbacks, it is that it is too busy, perhaps too rushed, too generic and has too many things jostling for space. But it is a fun film, exciting, dramatic and full of post 'Avengers' events. PS- Hang around for the 2 post credits scenes at the end.",Null,11,24,30 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Now pay the price for your lack of vision! - What we expected we got, for better or worse.
","'Brilliant! A work of true genius! The greatest most thrilling movie not only of this year but of the entire century! A fearless and daring work that reinvents the genre and reinvigorates it and sends it launching into a new age! A triumphant masterpiece and a film for the ages that cements JJ Abrams as one of the most brilliant talents of his generation, a true joy and the best night ever at the cinema!' – OK, just bill it to the usual address please Walt Disney inc, thanks!I have to admit off the bat that I had no faith in this project since Disney obviously only bought it as a shameless excuse to sell things (Ok Lucas did a bit of that but it was for a reason) and JJ Abrams has never made a film I have enjoyed ever and worse destroyed 'Star Trek' with a series that goes beyond insulting. I am one of those people who saw the first 'Star Wars' as a kid and have followed it ever since, maybe not as religiously as some but it was always something important accompanying me throughout my life rather like the Bonds or Star Trek. I am also one of those few people who liked the prequels which, despite having many flaws, were interesting as they took the series in another direction and looked at how and why the Republic fell and the Empire arose from its ashes. It saddens me when people say 'Politics and philosophy are so boring! I just wanna see cool sheet blow up!' as if that's all sci-fi ever was (it wasn't when the original Star Wars came out. It was largely about boring politics and philosophy back then) However I decided to give it a chance since several movies I prepped myself to hate have surprised me this year and we went to last night's anticipation filled midnight show at London's new Picturehouse cinema.This is only my opinion – Positives – The special effects are amazing (especially on a huge screen) and it's nice to see the original trilogy vehicles rendered in CGI. 3D is also great. Air battles now taking place in the sky and not space and the Empire now has a sizable female contingent including female Stormtroopers. A genuinely strong female lead also at last.The negatives – Absolute lack of originality. Already obvious from the merchandising, there are no new vehicles or uniforms or worlds, this Universe hasn't advanced at all since 1983. Fan service alone. Nothing is made clear, who are the First Order, what is the Rebellion and the Republic, how did they split? When and how was the Death Moon built? In Episode IV this sense of mystery was acceptable, but that is no longer possible in so complex and established a universe. The story is a rehash of Episode IV and deliberately so 'let's give them more of the same!' Like 'SPECTRE' brings nothing new to the table just karaoke versions of what's already been. A modern YAL like 'stringing along' structure in which nothing is resolved and everything is always being saved for later, unlike the Lucas movies where each had a clear self-contained narrative. Characters are fairly dull compared to those of other series. New kids are off the peg stereotypes (surly girl, cool jive talking black dude, daring quipping handsome pilot, funny robot sidekick) and are never developed beyond. The villains are also incredibly weak, not just Kylo Ren who is the biggest sissy ever to wield a light sabre but the entire Empire (sorry, 'First Order') who are led by a wimp and his team of wimps and controlled by a poorly rendered CGI something who is also weak. This is more like an insurance office than an evil empire! – Most of the scenes and dialogues in the trailers aren't even in the film and a lot of the stuff in the merchandising isn't either. As a sort of 'anti-prequel' most of it is shot live but unfortunately looks as if it was shot in someone's back garden and is as alien and exotic as weekend in Brighton (UK seaside resort) – The musical score is awful and has none of the usual majesty or emotional power. I know they went to Williams for name value but if this is all he can come up with at his time of life then give Giacchino the next one please. Two iconic moments made pathetic and underwhelming, ie the lame and sorry opening crawl and the 'swirlout' ending which spins and spins and spins around the same unimpressive final image for 2 minutes in a desperate attempt to make it epic.It feels more like some neat fan-made short on 'Youtube' or cutaways to one of those countless 'Star Wars' video games we've had since 1985 than anything in the original series. On its own it is a fun little science fiction adventure comparable to say 'Pacific Rim' or 'Jupiter Ascending' but, IMHO, it is in no way worthy enough to be considered part of a series that has become iconic exactly because they were original and daring and had something to say. Lucas and Spielberg birthed the series from their own love and passion and it showed in every frame of 6 movies. This is a shameless cash in and it shows in every frame. Doubtless it will make billions and receive rave reviews and be hailed as one of the greatest films ever made, something most people had already decided before they had seen it thanks to 2 years of relentless carpet-bomb marketing, rather like Obama was being hailed as the greatest president in history before he had even been elected. There are dozens more of these to come so sit back and wait for your three yearly dose of 'Star Wars' with accompanying hype. Enjoy :-)",6,89,169,17 December 2015
Flight," The Parable of Whip...Or the Sinner Redeemed (with nudity, drugs and a plane crash)
","Robert Zemeckis, like his contemporary Steven Spielberg, is a director who has built his reputation as a master of dark tinged family fantasy that side lines in 'serious drama', dramas that however carry over certain romantic, sentimental and even sugary aspects from their family friendly works into dark hard adult dramas. 'Flight' is Zemeckis first live action movie since 2000s 'Castaway', a film with which it shares many aspects. Both feature a terrifyingly realistic plane crash, both isolate their protagonists in a Hellish personal purgatory where their sins are cleansed by graphic suffering, and both end with redemption and the promise of life renewed. Both also have a sort of 'spiritual undercurrent' which hints at a hidden hand behind events, of a destiny meant to be, a 'divine plan' unfolding. It also bears some semblance to the 2007 reimagining of 'Beowulf', in which the epic tale of the flawless hero became a story of hubris and excess being tempered by realisation, and of sins cleansed and redemption won with suffering. And like 'Beowulf', this features some superficial 'Christian bashing' (here in the form of the Christian co-pilot and his bizarre cult like wife) as a clever bluff to avoid them looking too 'Churchy' for secular audiences. The story of a brilliant but hopelessly alcohol and drug addicted airline pilot whose inebriated/high state actually saves a plane from certain disaster, a man whose Hero status comes under scrutiny as investigations reveal his many weaknesses could have gone in many different ways. Here Zemeckis has chosen to go with the 'Castaway'/'Beowulf' sinner redeemed arc, and so concentrates almost entirely on Whip Whittaker (Washington)'s destructive addiction to booze and drugs, something he superficially tries to fight but actually accepts as simply part of who he is, despite the destruction it causes in his own personal life and the obvious danger it puts his passengers and crewmates into. We get hints at greater events happening around this, the investigation into the crash, the media frenzy and the building up of a folk hero who is then systematically demolished, the political blame games being played by Airline, Manufacturers and Pilot's union, the trauma of the survivors, lover Nicole's battle against Heroin and her forging of a new life etc, but they are all happening elsewhere, in another movie perhaps. Around the fallen sinner Whip we get a circle of interesting characters played by brilliant actors. Principal among them is recovering Heroin addict Nicole (played by Kelly Reilly, best known as Mary Watson in the Downey jr/Law Sherlock Holmes films) who in many ways is a more fleshed out version of the troubled sculptress that Tom Hanks eventually ends up with in 'Cast Away'. Here also the opening act suggests a synchronicity between their stories, a joint destiny working its way into being. A jovial Cancer patient who crashes their 'chance' meeting in hospital all but spells out that their meeting is no coincidence. We get the sense that Nicole is the star of her own dramatic story, happening contemporaneously to this one, but all we see of it is the parts that intersect with Whips leaving us naturally wanting more. Then there is Whips friend and dealer Harley (played by 'Fallen' co-star John Goodman, who is introduced to 'Sympathy for the Devil' perhaps as a knowing wink) who has little screen time but always saves the day with Cocaine (the film seems almost like an advert for the miraculous properties of Coke, which is bizarre to say the least!) There's Whip's old buddy from the Navy Days Charlie (the ever brilliant Bruce Greenwood) now his Pilot's Union rep who tries to save his career, the hotshot lawyer Lang (Don Cheadle) who goes from antagonist to supporter who does likewise, Nadine Velasquez as Katerina, the hot Latino hostess who shares Whips bed and vices, dies a heroine in the crash and eventually becomes the light beyond the grave that inspires his final redemption, and Margaret (Tamara Tunie) the only surviving hostess who helps save the day during the crash but becomes a stern moral voice in the days after. Melissa Leo also appears at the end as the chair of the inquest, but her character never escapes being a symbolic gatekeeper to paradise rather than a realistic hardnosed investigator. The film takes many liberties with reality in both the flying and airline politics scenarios (as pointed out by many industry professionals here on IMDb) and the actions of many of the characters are often contrived and illogical. Whip himself is a heroic soul who nonetheless also has to be a prize asshole and unlikable defecation for 90% of the film's running time in order to enact his final redemption, so he is a protagonist we can't really like or warm to. As mentioned, everyone else is dropping in from completely separate stories so they are not really fleshed out personalities.The opening crash is brilliantly shot (if fantastical) and the stuff of nightmares for those scared of flying. The film is also shot through with moral ambiguities, none of which are actually addressed, leaving the audience to make their own minds up about it. In order to fully do justice to the scenario here, we would need a mini- series that covered all the angles, but this is a stand-alone film so we only get one real story, Whips. Washington is excellent of course, showing his acting chops again after years of headlining moribund actioners (with an Oscar nod to show for it) as are the co-stars. I suppose how you feel about the film's message will depend on your personal beliefs, but as a human drama it can be enjoyed by anyone who has the stomach to watch largely self-inflicted agony for 2 and a half hours.",8,1,1,8 February 2013
The Purge," The Straw Dog that broke the camel's back - A Half-Arsed satire that makes a complete Arse of itself!
","The subject of Man still being just a killer animal deep down is one that has fascinated writers throughout the ages, and increasingly in the modern world, where we in the West have achieved a lifestyle of such mundane safety and freedom from risk that we fall almost into a malaise, a spiritual deadness, requiring a sudden jolt of violence to wake us up.From 'Dr Moreau' to 'Lord of the Flies' to 'Cape Fear' to 'Straw Dogs' to 'Death Wish' to 'Hunger Games' we've seen this theme fuelling dark and disturbing polemic tales. What better victims of this cruel revelation than the perfect, successful, All-American middle class professional family, their safe little castle prone to sudden violation from the forces of savagery without and within? Add to that then a frightening dystopian future world as a grisly mirror of where we are heading now, in this case why not a law that makes all crime legal in the U.S.A for one night of the year that allows us to purge all the vent up anger and frustration for the rest of the year? OK, that's actually a pretty stupid concept which has a thousand holes in it once you think about, not least of which is that no government and certainly no population would ever consider such a thing, especially in a year or two (this is set in 2023 and 'The Purge' has been running for years already)From this clichéd but still quite rich vein you could take the story in a hundred different fascinating directions. You could make a Judge Dredd/Robocop-esque satire on violence in the shiny corporate new world, you could make it the tale of a person who has repressed their anger all their life suddenly bursting it forth and finding they enjoy it, you could show violence and brutality as a social leveller, eliminating all supposed differences of caste, creed and society to show us all as the same animal beneath, you could show someone who refuses to become the monster even when everyone else has, clinging onto that faint wisp of civilization in uncivil times, you could make it a terrifying nihilistic nightmare in which those used to comfortable life find themselves facing uncontrolled brutality within the walls of their safe little home, the layers of their illusory state peeling away before them with more terror than any maniac could bring, you could make unlikable middle class bourgeoisie reveal their true natures over the dinner table in a Bunel- esque carnival of satire, you could comment on the wide-scale acceptance of violence in the media and how saturated we are with almost pornographic brutality while at the same time pretending that it does not really exist.Or you could make 'The Purge''The Purge' is one of the limpest films ever, which fails miserably as a social satire, a dystopian future nightmare and a blood chilling Horror movie. It is almost like drawing a straight line with a pencil, it starts, it carries on the same, then ends with no fluctuation, variety or development. The characters are literally place-holder cut-outs -the professional family man, his good mother wife, his rebellious teenage daughter and geeky teen younger son, the edgy boyfriend the father doesn't approve of, the noble saintly black man, the evil rich yahoo types, the snobby neighbours – who never evolve outside their 1 dimensional moulds. There are no shocks, no surprises, no twists you think might be coming, no grand lesson, no epiphany. Here everything IS simply black and white with absolutely no troubling shades of grey to worry your little heads about.The nice middle class professional family (who would already be married and having kids NOW) blindly accept what the Government tells them without a thought (You can murder rape and steal from who you like for a whole day? Hey, I'm fine with that..) and get rich from selling home security, which of course makes them partly evil because making money IS evil (unless of course you work in Hollywood, in which case it is perfectly OK) After a clichéd family dinner rift on Purge night, the geek son decides to take in an escaped slave pursued by lynch happy cackling plantation owners.(COUGH!!) Sorry, I mean a poor helpless black homeless man being pursued by lynch happy masked rich white kids (See, rich = EVIL, unless you work in Hollywood of course in which case rich = GOOD) The family find themselves being menaced by said bunch of Evil Rich White Kids, who wear stupid joker smile masks of themselves and rattle off 'we are the decent people, it is our task to eliminate the poor scum from the face of the Earth and leave it for the good rich white folk' speeches written by some Liberal Hollywood type who imagines that's how anybody outside his comfy little circle must think. Despite being built up as the ultimate in terror, these 'blood bloods' are the least menacing or effective opponents since the Demons in 'Ghost Rider' and the ease with which they are dispatched is almost insulting.What have we learned as the long dark night is over? That Rich people are evil (especially white ones, unless they work in Hollywood) that all black people are saintly and good, that 'New Founding Fathers' are also evil and probably Tea Partiers, that gun control is a must even though most of the killing done has been with knives and machetes, and that ambition for a family is itself dangerous.This film is as likely to insult Liberals as it is anyone else with its brazen stupidity and waste of a potentially interesting subject.And it's not scary or exciting either, but it could be a good cure for Insomnia if someone wants to patent it!",4,54,86,1 June 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The Capitol Strikes Back! - The revolution will be televised but no one bothered asking Katniss if she wanted to take part!
","'The Hunger Games' books by Suzanne Collins have become one of the most popular YAL phenomenon's of recent years, eschewing the mythical fantasy elements of most of the others and in Katniss Everdeen providing a pleasing counterweight to impassive, self-absorbed Bella Swan, even if the story they tell is hardly original ('The Grapes of Wrath' + 'Battle Royale' + 'Spartacus' + 'Gladiator'+ 'Rollerball' divided by Reality TV and Celeb culture) The first movie was well made and exciting, but could not escape from the limitations of its simple and well-trodden narrative, especially since the visceral violence, moral ambiguity and teenage slaughter that gave the horrific concept its power were virtually airbrushed out, making the feared gladiatorial trial into a glorified paintball game fought between fit good looking teens divided into absolute assholes and decent noble saintly types. Fortunately the second instalment expands both the story and the characters out as other 'part 2s' like 'the Empire Strikes Back' 'Matrix Reloaded' and 'Godfather II' did. Set a year after the last movie, it starts with Katniss and Peeta still playing their star crossed lovers part to an adoring televised audience, having become media darlings and an unwitting symbol of revolution and discontent to the masses in the fictional Roman Empire USA of Pan-Am. Wily President Snow at first tries to use her popularity to stave off revolt, something she acquiesces to since she realises the dreadful consequences of another all-out war, but once their whistle stop publicity tour only manages to make things worse, including bringing her own District 12 under brutal martial law, the situation becomes untenable. Shady new game maker Plutarch Heavensbee, a man with his own secret agenda, advises the desperate Snow to hold a special 'quarter quell' edition where only previous victors from each district will compete, in the hope of making Katniss out to be a murderer and so kill her popularity around Pan-Am. With events spiralling out of control for the scared and traumatised Katniss, she and Peeta end up back in the games alongside a host of former champions, most of whom are not best pleased and openly incite sedition. As full scale war looms without, within the new games area, Katniss and Peeta make allies with other enforced former champs Finnick, Johanna, Mags, Beetee and Wiress to form a team against the rest and against the myriad dangers sent against them by Plutarch, including acid mist, killer baboons, lightning, tidal waves and rivers of blood. As this happens Katniss finds herself increasingly torn between her affections for hunky paramour Gale while at the same time finding her respect and feelings for Peeta secretly swelling within to the point where she is willing to put his life before her own.Naturally the film finishes on a cliff hanger of the 'tune in next week' variety, but the fans who've read the books will be in no suspense. The direction from journeyman Francis Lawrence is good, and the script by Beaufoy and Arndt is effective and manages to create a sense of increasing emergency and tension as not only Katniss' world, but the entire system begins to fall apart as a result of her simple desire to live. The costumes, CGI cityscapes and sets are more impressive this time around (the safer bet having paid off) and the Hunger Games arena is a replica of Hawaii (shot in actual Hawaii though) which makes for a visually more interesting setting than No1's generic forest.The characterisation and the skilled actors bringing them to life are particularly impressive. Lawrence continues to grow as an actress, and oddly makes Katniss more vulnerable and human this time around, a scared, traumatised victim of other people's power play rather than just the ballsy archery chick of the first instalment. Josh Hutcherson still plays Peeta as a noble soul, but there is also vulnerability in him, hidden beneath, while his romantic rival Gale becomes the rifle wielding resistance leader courtesy of Liam Hemsworth but still has very limited screen and plot time. Woody Harrelson makes his alcoholic former champion and mentor Haymitch into a more rounded character, one who has seized the Katniss phenomenon and sees the chance to use it to finally do something good. Ditto Elizabeth Banks as oddly costumed hostess Effie, changing her horizon line of loyalty from the Capitol to her own personal team and so edging from quasi villain to quasi heroine. Stanley Tucci still excels as that personification of game show host false bonhomie and glitz Caesar Flickerman, with Marie-Antionette wig wearing Toby Jones still around as sidekick. Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings his usual cold, sinister cerebral quality to ambiguous game maker Plutarch, someone who may be a good guy but is still someone you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. Veteran master and legend Donald Sutherland (thank goodness these films exist to introduce him to a new generation) expands the character of President Snow, making him less villain and more just the guy at the top trying to keep everything from blowing up, increasingly frustrated as he realises bloody war is coming regardless. Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Sam Claflin, Jena Malone and Lynn Cohen make for good former champs and allies, making this more a team event that all against all.A solid middle chapter, and the last to feature the 'games' concept (already well played out by Episode 1 and feeling quite deja-vu here) it stands as a great improvement on the already solid first part and hopefully a good indication of the civil war drama to come in episodes 2 and 3.",8,2,19,21 November 2013
Godzilla," Gojria Vs. Cloverfield - Hollywood Kaiju homage has heart in right place but inherits many problems from its source material.
","As a lifelong Godzilla (and Kaiju movie in general) lover, I was both excited and wary when the new version rolled around, still bearing the terrible scars of disappointment with the 1998 'reimagining'. Back then nobody would have spent a nickel on a genuine 'Kaiju' homage, but a lot can happen in two decades and now 'Geek is King'! So like last year's equally niche but fun Kaiju/Anime homage 'Pacific Rim' this one nods many knowing winks at the 'cognoscenti while keeping it generic enough for the layperson to part with their entrance fee. The new take sticks closely to the traditional 'Kaiju' template.The characters are all stock as well, save Taylor Johnson's Brody who is an American military everyman archetype, with scientists and generals meeting regularly to discuss unfolding developments and devise ineffective solutions. 'Godzilla 1998' borrowed from the first movie's premise, Godzilla as atomic destroyer, but it also showed how limited such a template is, becoming 'just another frakking disaster movie'. Even Ishiro Honda and the guys at Toho realised this as the format changed immediately with the second movie, going for a 'whoever wins we lose -Godzilla does battle with another monster who may or may not be more dangerous than he is' style. Eventually the series merged with 'The Mysterians' to become 'Godzilla and humanoid heroes vs a series of kind of sympathetic but still dangerous alien races who control monsters intent on taking over the Earth' battles, and this is probably Godzilla's most famous phase, giving us classics such as 'Destroy all Monsters' 'Invasion of the Astro Monsters' and 'Godzilla vs Gigan'. This film borrows the basic outline of phase 2, Godzilla vs a more dangerous monster while humanity looks on not sure who to back if anyone?The 'MUTOS' (a designation rather than a name) are based unashamedly on the 'Cloverfield' monster, a clever little jab at that 'found footage' disaster (in more ways than one!) and its pretence to the Godzilla crown. One male hatches and destroys a Japanese nuclear reactor in 1999 while the other incubates until it's ready to mate. This initial story line involves Bryan Cranston's Joe Brody, a scientist and family man who becomes an obsessed maniac when his wife dies, trying to convince the world of the existence of a monster only to be ridiculed and mocked. It's a little homage to one of the best of the original series, 'The Terror of Mechagodzilla', the ultra –dark film with which Honda closed a series that other hands had turned into increasingly cheap and ludicrous bubble gum cartoons for kids. Alas he is only in it for the first twenty five minutes or so, swiftly written out once his character arc is done. (His screen wife Juliette Binoche is in it for even less!) The baton is handed to his son, Aaron 'Kick Ass' Taylor-Johnson, a bomb disposal expert and family man who becomes our 'on the spot' hero armed with the necessary scientific knowledge to make him the human epicentre of events. David Strathairn takes the role of 'General who sits in endless meetings and gives audience exposition' usually played by Yoshifumi Tajima while Ken Watanabe plays the 'wise and knowing' scientist role usually played by Takashi Shimura. Like the originals, two very talented character actors give kudos to utterly empty roles requiring only gravitas and a straight face. Spunky and intelligent female characters were a regular in the series, but for our American hero archetype we have the 'devoted wife and mother' role played by a similarly underused Elizabeth Olson. Perhaps to counterbalance we have Sally Hawkins as Watanabe's assistant, who joins the rest in having little demanded of her talents. Whatever this movie is, a powerhouse acting tour de force it isn't! (save Cranston)The structure is clunky, the characters two dimensional at best and the dialogue often hokey, but these faults are mostly inherited from the structure they were trying to copy. A bigger fault that is all its own is that we rarely see the battles between Godzilla and the MUTO lovers, a kind of 'always in the background' technique director Gareth Edwards used in his ground breaking sci-fi home movie 'Monsters'. Like Spielberg, this route was taken due to a simple lack of means, and so there is no call for it here. Sure, what we see is great, but we see so little of it! Most appears on TV screens or in the background when all we want is to sit down and get a ringside seat for the big fight, 12 rounds between the champ and the contender, like the originals. It turns out to be extremely frustrating, especially since the human characters we focus on are just place-fillers! That said, the digital CGI Godzilla looks and moves just like the original (gone is that chicken lizard POS from 1998!) and also has that same intelligence in his expression, reminding us he is no dumb brute. He also has blue fire which powers up along his dorsal fins and punches and throws his opponents, a 'motion capture' update of the 'men in suits' technique, which endears it to the fans. The film ends, as all good Godzilla films do, with the battered hero returning to the sea after his bout is done, leaving the wide eyed humans to see him off. Nobody actually waves and shouts 'Goodbye Godzilla!' alas, unless it is in a deleted scene somewhere.At last a Hollywood tribute to Godzilla done right, it is nonetheless riven with problems which may hurt its chances at the Box Office. We hope not, because if this works then future bouts against King Ghidorah, Hedorah, Gigan could become a mouth-watering prospect for future summer seasons!",8,9,19,16 May 2014
Spectre," Daniel's Die Another Day - Craig bows out in a bizarre, disjointed and meta-movie that's also fun and enjoyable
","The 'Craig years' started out as a reaction against the campiness of Brosnan's 'Die Another Day' and though daring initially it is a difficult tone to sustain for a franchise like Bond. As ever revolution breeds counter-revolution and a whole host of new pretenders have been packing in cinemas with their defiant cry of 'old school Bond is best!' With 'Fast and Furious' 'Kingsman' and 'Mission Impossible (4+5)' biting at their heels, some serious script rewrites have taken place and a massive change of tone introduced for this fourth 'new continuity' Bond. What we have is a strange, bizarre, almost surreal film that plays out like some odd Bond fever dream that you keep expecting him to wake from back into his bland reality, walking a tight rope between seriousness and outright parody, the latter very often resembling 'Austin Powers'.The story is already very well-known both via a leaked script and the spoiler filled trailers and publicity materials. Bond follows a lead from the recently deceased 'M' (never mentioned in Skyfall) to chase an Italian hit-man named Marco Sciarra in Mexico and after getting into trouble with the new M goes to Rome where a very brief seduction of Monica Bellucci (why do Italian actresses only get bit parts in modern Bonds?) leads to a Spectre meeting where he meets his long lost adopted brother Christoph Waltz who is now going under the name Blofeld and after the much publicised Aston vs Jaguar chase through Rome he follows a vague lead to find former enemy but now actually all round decent good guy (?) Jesper Christensen who puts him onto his shapely daughter and MI4 hand me down Lea Seydoux at the Piz Gloria clinic and after a plane-car chase through them mountains they go to Tunisia where, after some romantic train sex and a Jaws style train fight with David Bautista, they follow leads to Blofeld's high-tech base in a hollowed out volcano Meteorite crater from where he plans something to do with absolute surveillance but is never clear. It's all about getting back at Bond for stealing daddy's love etc, then the extra finale in London which gets sillier by the moment then the oddest ending ever in a Bond which literally says 'Craig's done and he's leaving the building. Goodnight everyone!'There is plenty of action this time around but despite being 'old school' and spectacular, there is a lack of genuine thrills. The helicopter fight, the car chase, the plane chase, the train fight, the exploding villain's lair, final against the clock battle and boat-helicopter duel all feel well, 'ordinary' and bland. You watch them nodding your head then carry on with blood unpumped and nerves unjangled. Maybe it's Newman's poor score (great composer but not for this sort of thing) or Mende's lack of action experience but it makes what ought to be incredible just OK.There are endless nods and namechecks to previous Bonds, in fact half the film is just Bond namechecks and though it's fun as a Bond lover to spot them they don't actually add up to anything fresh or original. They ought to be creating NEW iconic Bond moments here, not just repeating old ones! Plus there are influences from all over the place, mostly 'Austin Powers' , not only in the meta-parody nature of much of it but also in the relationship between Dr Evil and Powers which is pretty much how the official 007 series now replays Bond and Blofeld! – As in the previous 3 Craigs a 'villainous plot' is barely even existent, something to do with 'worldwide surveillance', causing terror attacks to convince governments to sign on to the world wide spynet he is building etc, all recycled from other similar fashionable 'conspiracy theory' ideas, a flogged horse now not only dead but in advanced stages of decomposition! Not that it matters anyway and it's just an excuse for Bond and Blofeld to trade handbags at fifty paces. – Gadgets are back as is an iconic tricked out car and an exploding watch plays a key role and best of all, the long removed 'Gunsight opening' is back at the start in its traditional glory so HURRAY and about XXX time! – There is also a more traditional Bond opening titles sequence with a shirtless Craig, sexy women, octopuses and more octopuses, women becoming octopuses, being held by octopuses and dancing on octopuses featuring Sam Smith.Acting is fine. Craig is now playing the old 007 and is not too bad at it, less brooding more fun. Lea Seydoux makes for a good old school spunky and resourceful Bond girl and fares well in drama, action and romance moments. Monica Bellucci is only a cameo really. David Bautista is similarly underused playing a mute Jaws style killer and frankly any muscular man could have played his role, a pity given what he showed he could do in GOTG. Waltz simply camps it up hence the Dr Evil comparisons but how could you play Blofeld straight these days anyway? The rest of 'team Bond' are on form and get to do their own thing throughout the film.Totally different from the previous Craigs, this is both his Swann-song (literally) and a turning point as Broccoli and Wilson ask 'Quo Vadis 007?' from here on in. Let's hope they decide to go forward into the future to make new adventures and not just back to revisit what has already been again.",7,4,20,27 October 2015
Her," In Love with the Ghost in the Machine - Dystopian futuristic tale of alienation that's a big soppy chick flick at heart
","Finally got to see this at our multiplex on the very day it won (deservedly? – discuss) Oscar for best original screenplay.If there is a word to describe Spike Jonze latest then it is 'Aquarian', in that it takes inspiration from the metaphysical/philosophical/existential movies of the 1960s and 70s, especially from the European New Wave (it even has a 'New Wave' look to it)Set in 'the near future', that elusive period that's always about 30 or so years ahead of us and which inevitably looks like our time expanded and is always a hoot when proved to be utterly off the mark as the time itself arrives (Audiences in 2044 will doubtless say that about 'Her'), this story is a mixture of genres and themes, none of them seemingly a natural fit. There is the 'dystopian future' angle showing a future where people have become socially disconnected by technology. Then there is the 'speculative Sci-Fi' angle with a line of easily available Artificial Intelligence systems that can think like humans, and then the central tragedy of a man who is so paralysed by fear that he wilfully destroys all relationships and hopes of happiness then is left crying over the consequences (aka the self-perpetuating tragedy) However all these elements end up merging into what many here have criticised for being basically a romantic love story (albeit with a weird premise). This is a fair comment, though the movie wears its big red mushy chick flick heart on its sleeve quite openly and unashamedly. There are probably a thousand and one ways to tell this story, but Jonze chose to take it in this direction, perhaps feeling the need to tell an optimistic love story at this point in his life.The 'romance' between Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix) and the impossibly advanced AI system naming itself 'Samantha' (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) is actually quite touching, and not as perverse or unnatural as many here seem to think. 'Samantha' is not a 'computer' but an artificial sentient life form, born with a need to learn and evolve through 'her' contact with humanity, hungering for life itself as only such a being could. Far from being a speculative look at AI, 'she' is really a modern form of Frankenstein's monster (or the Bride of Frankenstein perhaps?) and all those that have followed in our fiction to serve as mirrors of ourselves to shame us into feeling more alive than we sometimes do. The other characters in this future world are aware of the nature of these 'creations' and are equally in awe of them, though mainly they selfishly see only what they can provide for them (as Theodore does most of the time) in terms of companionship and interaction. Rather like the artificial beings of 'Solaris', they bond naturally with their hosts, taking their initial shapes from their desires and trying to please them while at the same time growing beyond those needs, so when Theodore's neighbour Amy (Amy Adams) needs a friend her ex-husbands AI becomes that. Recently divorced Theo wants true love, and with a messy divorce from wife Cathy (Rooney Mara) and a self- destroyed blind date with a hot girl (Olivia Wilde) he finds it naturally in 'Samantha'. Much of the film is both 'Samantha' and Theodore learning to be alive and human together in a series of 'tender' scenes which look odd since one of the two lovers is a consciousness without a body, a virtual 'ghost' in the machine, a state she is only too aware of. A lot of the story is about how 'Samantha' tries to overcome the physical/non-physical boundary, including a variation on 'phone sex' and even hiring a human body surrogate she 'remote controls' in a steamy session destined from inception to end badly.Like 'Solaris' (Book and both movie versions) the strange but tender love story has to go somewhere for the tale to mean anything (unless it becomes a sitcom) and again there are many roads it could take. The one it does eventually take is part of what makes it so 'Aquarian', and leads to the metaphysical, spiritual, and Jungian, with our own creations beckoning us to go beyond our fragile mortal forms into the greater unknown after them. It is sad and hopeful, generally optimistic but not without pain, rather like life really.Acting wise, Phoenix does another marvellous job, creating the famed 'dead man waiting to come alive' part, and then carrying off an entire romantic picture where the other lover is invisible and not physically present! (Ghostly love stories usually allow the 'living' lover to have someone to interact with even if no one else can see them) Likewise Scarlett Johansson, everybody's dream girl manages to make 'Samantha' a warm and loving being despite being only a disembodied voice and proves she doesn't need her looks to act (but they help!) Amy Adams provides another 'highbrow' performance playing a pleasantly normal and down to earth woman, a computer games designer (her 'perfect housewife' inter actives are a hoot!) that may be the soul mate and friend Theodore needs. Rooney Mara and Olivia Wilde do well in their small cameo parts, providing a lens to the hero's personal insecurities and neurosis.Not a film for everybody, it is a love story between two beings in desperate need of growth and life, one of whom is not human but wants to be, and is a disembodied entity that communicates only by earpiece! Hopeful, and yes romantic, it is a story that could touch your heart if you want it touched, otherwise it is an interesting and unusual piece by a director who specialises in them.",8,0,1,3 March 2014
The Great Gatsby," A Great Gatsby for 2013
","Stories, especially famous ones, thrive on their retelling. Different artists can pick out different aspects of the tale or give it a particular slant or direction, rather like different singers produce idiosyncratic covers of the same song.The original always remains no matter what.'The Great Gatsby' is a story of artifice: of a man who constructs an entire existence out of artifice with the sole aim of rekindling an artificial 'great love story' which exists now almost entirely in his own mind and romantic memories, who achieves it by living a lie designed by his sinister backers in order to further their criminal activities. One can see why Baz Lurhmann, relentless champion of artifice and un- reality, would be attracted to such a tale, even more so given that it is set within the debauched Jazz age, now virtually a whole centuries remove from us (while the more famous 1974 version was made when it was still living memory, equivalent to a tale today told about the 60s) and whose music and style still influences the current pop scene.We have seen his own gaudy versions of classic love stories 'Romeo and Juliette' and 'Moulin Rouge', infused with over the top spectacle, cabaret dance numbers and modern music, yet also shot through with a very delicate romantic sensibility when dealing with the tragic loves at their hearts. 'TGG' is also a tragic love story of course, but tragic for a different reason. Here the tragedy is not of two star crossed lovers who cannot achieve Earthly happiness because of social impossibilities yet hold the flame of love to death and possibly beyond, but of one man who dreams of a love story that cannot be and destroys everything including himself in the process of trying to vainly realise it. Such a story is much harder to pull of course, though it is a common enough theme in tragedy throughout the ages (and the headlines of almost any newspaper) and it is also harder to get behind the characters. We intensely will two ardent lovers to be together, but watching a farce played out by a fool and a selfish harlot is hardly going to stoke the fire in our souls! To his credit, Lurhmann has created a version that is faithful to the original, both in spirit and narrative, and also created something that will satisfy as a cinematic drama, especially for those totally unfamiliar with the book or other versions. Of course it is 'Lurhmann Style', but is not the gaudy vulgar 3D circus the rather unappealing trailer made it out to be. The CGI fuelled artifice works within the context of what he is trying to do because (A) It's a Lurhmann project and (B) as we said the before the whole story, and indeed the sub-strata of an entire age of gaudy artifice, accommodates such blatant un- reality. The actors chosen to play the parts do so fairly well. De Caprio, launched to real fame by Lurhmann as the tragic young Romeo now plays the tragic 30-something Gatsby. Like Redford in 74, a modern superstar is needed to play a character that is glamour and success apparently personified (but is just an actor like the actor playing him!) and De Caprio fits that bill for 2013 audiences. He does well in conveying the basic sham under the glamour, being little more than a love sick adolescent who still hasn't grown out of it, a little boy still dreaming of being a Prince. He fares less well in creating an aura of power and success, but given that his sham is revealed almost immediately in this version (rather like the interestingly analogous Mandarin character in the current Iron Man) perhaps that was the intention. He nails the basic tragedy of Gatsby, the naïve dreamer still pining for his fairy-tale castle and fairy tale princess, so that crucial element works. Tobey Maguire plays Tobey Maguire again, just as he did through 3 Spider Mans, and his take on narrator Nick Carraway is still Peter Parker. However, given that he is meant to be an idealistic fool taken in by all the glamour even as it evaporates, his casting is spot on! Carey Mulligan, already a veteran of tragic love stories, does well as the elusive object of his obsession Daisy, who was never intended to be a particularly alluring or beautiful, but rather to be a symbol of everything that Gatsby aspired to. Joel Edgerton is also good as Daisy's brutish jock husband, finding a redeeming quality beneath the seemingly ugly character and making us care for him (his views on race and class, though distasteful to modern audiences, were actually the norm for intelligent educated people at the time) Short changed alas are the 'Ash Valley' couple of Myrtle (Isla Fisher) and George (Jason Clarke) Wilson, who perform nicely but are reduced to mere plot points – This beautified version keeps the ugly poverty very much to the margins! Elizabeth Debicki is also very good as golf pro, sarcastic observer and Carraway paramour Jordan Baker, but her part has also been drastically reduced here.The anachronistic music is part of the Lurhmann style so is what it is. This being aimed at young 2013 audiences, it gets the IDEA of party madness across well while still maintaining a sampled styling of 20s sounds. Delicately mournful ballads are also provided for the 'tragic love' bits too of course, courtesy of the likes of Lana Del Rey, Emile Sande and Florence Welche.As a dramatic film is works well enough, and will crucially serve as an introduction to a great (and still highly relevant) masterpiece and the great F.Scott Fitzgerald to younger audiences who may never have heard of either. For that alone it should be praised.",8,4,6,20 May 2013
