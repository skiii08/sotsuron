The Blair Witch Project," The ShakyCam Project
","I'll tell you what I find sad: when something gets hyped to the point where there's just no way that it can ever live up to people's expectations. I remember reading a quote somewhere saying that this movie was scarier than the Exorcist. If I hadn't already seen the movie at that point, I would've been pretty disappointed had I gone to see it with this quote in mind. I personally believe that I will not see a film scarier than the Exorcist during my lifetime. At the time of this writing, I am twenty-eight years old. The Exorcist is the scariest movie of all time in my opinion and this film, chilling as it can be at points, comes nowhere near first place. I feel the need to express this because so many people that I know have watched this thinking they were about to get the very life scared out of them, only to walk away shaking their heads in disgust. I happen to think that while it's not the greatest horror movie in the world, nor is it a great movie, period, as a whole I have to give it a good write-up because let's face it, the filmmakers took a good idea and ran with it. The way that this film was done and marketed is the kind of thing that makes one ask themselves, 'Now, why didn't I come up with that idea?'. You're probably familiar with the story behind it already but if you're not, here it is: three young filmmakers head out to the woods as part of their research project on an old legend revolving around the Blair Witch and mysteriously disappear. The movie you watch is supposed to be the actual footage they filmed while stuck in the forest, found a year later. It's shot entirely with a camcorder and a black and white 16mm camera held by any of the three main characters. Those who get motion sickness easily may want to avoid this entirely because there are scenes in the film where the shots go all over the place in that sickening way that camcorders tend to produce more than regular film does. The whole idea is to give it a pseudo-documentary feel and I think it works well for the most part. There was this whole marketing craze where they didn't tell anyone that the whole thing was a fake and they actually pulled it off to some extent, even going so far as to have a website dedicated to the mystery of the Blair Witch and the strange revelations that emerged from the search team's findings. When I saw this in the theaters, a girl outside was crying about how sad it was that they never found the three kids. She bought the whole thing obviously. I read up on movies a lot so I didn't fall for it because I knew about the whole myth thing beforehand. At any rate, I found the movie to be generally unsettling. The acting is acceptable but seems forced on occasion. It's my understanding that they were given a rough approximation of what kind of performance they were to give in note form so maybe it stems from that. There are some pretty creepy moments in this film and if you've ever been camping in the middle of a dark forest, you know exactly how scary this movie can be at times. If you have to see this movie, watch it for the end sequence which in my opinion is one of the most frightening scenes in any movie I have ever seen. Watch it under the right conditions: dark lights, night time, quiet setting. I guarantee that if you watch this with no huge expectations, you will be satisfied. RATING:***1/2 out of *****, a half a star thrown in for a genuine attempt at giving us something we haven't seen before and doing it with a bare amount of materials at their disposal.",Null,0,1,11 July 2003
Gremlins," Yum Yum!
","I'm not gonna waste your time describing the movie other than to say that it is more than entertaining and the kids as well as the adults'll love it. It's really funny, contains numerous references to classic horror and sci/fi movies and has pretty decent acting. There's things in this movie that you just don't see too much of anymore these days. I'll sum it up with this: if you ever wanted to see a vicious little monster bite the dust by means of microwave power, look no further. There's a funny scene involving a blender as well that's hilarious but I'll let you check that out for yourself. One last thing: I saw this movie on HBO the other day and I've been saying 'Yum yum' ever since. You just might too.

Requiem for a Dream," 'Naturally.....'
","I'm a firm believer in keeping praises light. You start praising a movie too much and doing it in too much detail, you ruin it for others. At least that's what I think. All I'd like to say about this movie is that it is a masterpiece. I can't find one single fault in this movie, not even with Marlon Wayans and that's saying something. Everyone from the casual moviegoer to the seasoned film buff should watch this one. It may be a little hard to watch for some of you but this movie needs to be watched by a lot more people. I'm expecting great things from Mr. Aronofsky in the future. I'll close with this: the DVD for this movie is incredible. Picture, sound, everything. Buy the DVD, watch it and realize that you own a sure-fire winner. Rating: ***** out of *****.",Null,0,0,16 August 2001
The Ring," See ya Samara!
","What people fail to realize is: there hasn't been a decent scary movie to come out of a major Hollywood studio in years. In all honesty, the last thing I saw that kinda freaked me out recently was the House on Haunted Hill remake and that wasn't all that spooky anyway, save for key scenes. This is cause for celebration! I went to see this not looking for an Oscar contender, I went to get spooked and thats exactly what I got! People pulling their hair waiting for some decent chills, look no further because this movie's got your number. The beginning of the movie literally had me trembling! It's the type of drawn out intro scene that you've seen in movies that you've seen before like Halloween and Scream but it's so well done here that it definitely gets the ball rolling for the upcoming events. I did think the movie was a little uneven at times and it left me with more questions than answers. Some of the acting is a little blah and there were definitely some holes but still, people... I haven't seen a movie that scared me this bad in a while. Naomi Watts gives a good performance and the little girl in this movie did what she had to do. The few special effects present were unobtrusive. The video itself is dang creepy in it's own right. I just like this movie. There's an air of dread hanging over it right from the beginning and any movie that has you feeling uncomfortable for almost two hours gets my vote. In all-time scariness ratings, I wouldn't put it past the Exorcist or even the Exorcist III. I'd put it in my top five though, I am confident in that at least. Now, on to the Japanese original!

Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the few films that you can actually say is perfect
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is, without a doubt, a perfect film. Thrills, chills, romance, solid acting, fantastic and instantly memorable music, sure handed direction, a great story, great production values, great special effects that don't get in the way of the story, awesome villains, cool heroes and heroines, awesome action set pieces... what more can you ask for? I love this movie to death and it's one of those films that I can watch over and over. There's really not much more that I can say about the film other than it really is one of the greatest films ever. Putting Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Lawrence Kasdan, John Williams and Harrison Ford together has produced one of the greatest screen adventures of all time and really, we should all be thankful. It makes me wonder if we'll ever see films like this again, that are just pure magic. One can only hope.I guess the only thing I can really say is, if you haven't seen this yet, stop reading this and make it a point to get your hands on a copy as soon as possible.And really, if you haven't seen this at all, shame on you.

Training Day," You got the magic eye, Hoyt!
","Now, who actually thought that this movie was gonna be as good as it was? 'Fess up, now! Denzel gives an incredible performance as Alonzo, one of the greatest bastards that recent film has granted us. You have to see this to believe it, folks, Denzel is not a nice guy in this. There are a few scenes where you actually think to yourself that he is not the kind of guy you would want to cross or even come across walking in the street. He exudes danger and that's why he won the Oscar. He flipped everyone with this choice of roles. This movie could have easily been straight to video but how does a straight to video movie get a cast like this? I don't know but we can start by handing off kudos to David Ayer, screenwriter. Antoine Fuqua, director. You more than made up for that piece of splatch, Replacement Killers. Ethan Hawke, supporting role. You held your own and you definitely got the magic eye. I absolutely loved this movie and recommend it whole heartedly. And if you made a list of the top-ten most tense scenes of all time, you'd have to include Ethan Hawke in the gangmembers house.

Fight Club," I am Jack's lungs filling with smoke
","I refuse to go into any in-depth description of why I think you should see this movie. I won't even pick a particular scene to dissect, which is what I usually do in my user comments. This is classic stuff, people. Not only that, it gets better every time you watch it. It kind of drags at one point but not enough to ruin the perfect rating I'm undoubtedly going to give it. Currently one of the top three dvd's you can buy, especially if you have the proper home theater. See the movie. Love the movie. Buy the dvd, treasure the dvd.

Akira," It's great, it really is, but Ninja Scroll is the best anime ever
","Akira was my intro to the world of anime back in'89. I can't explain it, but the moment I saw the flickering sign outside of the bar, I was grabbed. It's an incredible piece of art, but I've only seen the dubbed version and it's a little difficult to comprehend just what in the hell is going on, even after multiple viewings. This movie is similar to David Lynch's Lost Highway, where just when you think you have a valid explanation of the film, you pull your hair out when you realize that you've left out one detail that brings the structure of your overall grasp of it crashing down. That's why I'm not even trying to explain the film. I've seen it God knows how many times and I still can't grasp it completely. Akira has just been announced for DVD, so I'll hopefully be able to watch it in the Japanese language with English subtitles and explain it afterward, since this tends to be the most accurate way to watch these movies. It definitely oozes style and the animation does surpass anything that Disney's put out (except Tarzan, which is incredible in it's own right) and yes, the music is amazing. It drags a little in places but not to the point where it's excruciating to watch. This movie is a triumph of anime and it's my strong belief that it comes in second only to Ninja Scroll, my all-time favorite. AKIRA Rating: ****1/2 out of *****.",Null,1,4,30 July 1999
Underworld," The cinematic equivalent of ruining a Cup O' Noodles
","Think about it. All you need to do with a Cup O' Noodles is add hot water up to the cutoff line, stir it and let it sit there for like two or three minutes. That's how simple it is. Sadly, Underworld is a Cup O' Noodles that was prepared really wrong.Underworld, if handled by the proper people, could've been a great Cup O' Noodles. I mean, for the love of Mike, they had everything they needed to make this. A war between vampires and werewolves raging in the streets, just under view of the public eye. Listen to the way that sounds. Now if you're like me, that's enough to make you drool with the possibilities. Okay, maybe not drool but you have to admit that it's an idea that just sounds good. The first I heard of this movie got me excited and the trailer looked promising enough. So why is it that while I'm watching this movie, I feel like doing bodily harm to someone? Why, I'll tell you! This movie bites, pun fully intended. This movie is really, really bad. There were moments in the film where I did my best Dwayne Wayne impression with a big, 'Huh?', unintentionally. The story makes little sense and seems to be more interested in subjecting the viewer to 'highbrow' dialogue, that is actually a lot less intellectual than it sounds, than what said viewer most likely wants to be subjected to: satisfying action. But I'll save that little detail for last, the whole problem with the action in the movie. I have other bones to pick first. The acting sucks unfortunately. I was able to stomach Kate Beckinsale but I think that was mainly due to her looking damn tasty in those leather outfits. Not to say her acting was bad which didn't but she was sadly and criminally wasted in this movie and it makes it even worse to think that they could not pull off such a great premise with this girl in the lead, who was pretty much pitch perfect. Everybody else in the movie delivers blandly, especially the jerk who plays Craven. Boy, was he horrible. I wanted to slap him with a wet sock the moment he delivered his first line. Why he was cast is a question that only the director will probably ever know. Unless he was a nephew of one of the gaffers or something. Then maybe you could ask the gaffer if you ever get to speak to him. Special effects? Terrible. It was hard not to laugh when I saw the first werewolf transformation in the movie. I managed to hold it in, at least, until the second transformation happened. The werewolf transformations look absolutely horrendous. It almost looked like they took some Pop Rocks and fed it to someone's German Shepherd, slowing the film down so you could catch every little flesh shuddering crackle and pop. Think about this: An American Werewolf in London came out back in 1981 and the werewolf transformations in Underworld come nowhere near the quality of Werewolf in London. This in 2003, when effects are supposedly at an all time high. How sad is that? Very, if you ask me. The movie looks great which is really just another sad casualty in this film. There's something about a movie with wasted cinematography that just drives a stake through my heart. And this my friends, is where I tell you what the biggest problem with this movie is. Originality. I read a review of this film upon its release that summed it up perfectly. I don't remember the exact quote but it touched upon the fact that there is almost nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before or done better. I couldn't put it any better. The action scenes are just bland and it's obvious that somebody watched and tried to rip off Blade prior to filming this movie. Speaking of Blade, that particular film was ransacked for ideas for this movie. If you know your Blade movies, you will feel a sense of deja vu watching this. This film is reason enough to question the validity of imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. There are moments in this film that are blatantly ripped off from some pretty recent movies. To give you a perfect example, there is a transition in the film where the camera goes into what is on a computer monitor. Not only does this scene rip off a very similar transition in the first Matrix movie but they even had the gall to use the same weird trademark sound effects that were used in the Matrix in that same scene. Shameless.They had the premise, they had the look, they had the heroine and they just had to blow it. I don't understand how they could have fudged it. How hard could it have been to pull something great out of the idea that they had? My guess is that somebody didn't read the recipe on their Cup O' Noodles container. A sad experience which I have no desire to relive.

Dawn of the Dead," Run, Zombie, Run!
","Ten Point Review:1) In a nutshell, this movie is not as good as the original but is still a surprisingly good flick. It is a respectful homage, even if you could argue that the only real similarity is that they are both set in malls.2) The zombies run pretty fast. Fast enough to make the movie a little more unsettling. Think Return of the Living Dead and you'll know what kind of zombies you have here, though the ones in this movie don't call for more cops and paramedics over CB radios.3) There is hardly any kind of character development. What little there is is effective to some degree. It's kind of a shame that the movie wasn't over two hours like the original was because it would've given us a bit more time to get to know these characters. I thought the character of Michael was great while some of the others were really just one note performances. Some of the acting sucked pretty bad also but hey what do you expect, Macbeth?4) Tom Savini, Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger make cameo appearances in the movie. I thought that Ken Foree's in particular was pretty cool. I also dug the fact that there was a store named 'Gaylen Ross'.5) I really hate when they make horror movies that have a lot of hard rock/ thrash/ whatever music in them. Gore and guitars don't mix well for me. At the same time, I thought there were some pretty inspired music choices, like Johnny Cash's 'The Man Comes Around' and Jim Carroll's 'People Who Died'. I have to say that Richard Cheese's cover of 'Down With the Sickness' was a high point as far as the music went.6) This movie pulls no punches when it comes to taking out the main characters. While I said earlier that there was no character development to speak of really, you do feel it when certain characters die.7) The special effects are very impressive. While not as visceral as Savini's were (sorry, but when people got bit in the original, they got BIT, meaning they got a nice healthy chunk taken out of them), they are still pretty effective. And there are several kills, both human and zombie, that were executed very well. I would've liked the movie to be even gorier and that's after having seen the original in theaters and the uncut on video.8) The opening sequence, all the way up to the beginning credits, is excellent. It may be the best part of the movie. The direction is a little flashy at times with some unnecessary fancy shots but is still tight regardless. I think the look of the movie is pretty interesting also, with this bleached out color scheme that seems to get more and more washed out as the movie progresses.9) This movie isn't particularly scary. There are barely any shock scares. The horror lies mainly in imagining yourself in the predicaments that the characters face. 10) The story doesn't end when you might think. Make sure to sit through the credits.Rating: *** out of *****.",Null,0,0,30 October 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Yo ho ho and a two and a half hour plus running time
","Cap'n Jack Sparrow returns to walk around drunkenly and make the requisite one liners, along with almost everyone from the first POTC (even the midget!). What you end up with is a pretty good swashbuckler that runs a little too long.I just saw the midnight show and I have to say that it was pretty good. Not as good as the first but still enjoyable. But then again, I went into the first POTC thinking I was about to see a crap-filled diaper of a movie and came out pleasantly surprised. I absolutely loved Davy Jones in this. To think that they achieved his look without any makeup is mind boggling. CGI effects are getting frighteningly photorealistic and Davy Jones character is unbelievably well done. The movie is funny and the story, while a tad complicated, is not too hard to follow. There are a lot of different characters in this, both good and bad and it will be interesting to see how their story lines will be resolved. I loved the constant references to the first and I suggest watching the first before watching this, just to be completely refreshed. The special effects are well realized and the scenes with the Kraken are pretty wild. The movie has a ton of action with one really cool three way swordfight on a rolling wheel. Depp is pretty funny but his character seems to have lost a little bit of the charm he had in the first POTC. He's still the main thing to see in this show but this time around, I sincerely doubt he'll be getting another Oscar nomination for Cap'n Jack. Keira Knightley is gorgeous as always and Orlando Bloom does what is required of him. Other standouts include Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma and the crew of the Flying Dutchman who are just outright nasty. There's an awesome cameo at the end of the film that I won't spoil but the audience cheered when they showed up.I'd have to say that this movie was pretty good but nothing to write home to Mom about. It was a little underwhelming, even for such a massive production. I think the length is the one thing about this movie that kind of hurts it. There was a lot of stuff at the beginning that felt needless and maybe could have been trimmed. I do want to see the third installment and Dead Man's Chest does have that Empire Strikes Back cliffhanger thing going for it, so I guess it did something right. The bit after the credits was really funny also.Johnny Depp fans should be satisfied, at least.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",7,4,13,7 July 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," ...and a bottle of rum! (Or two. Or three even.)
","I watched this last night at a sneak preview here in NYC and I came away impressed. Johnny Depp has proven that he is the man, once and for all. I swear, from the moment you first see him, you're gonna have a big smile on your face. He's hilarious. That entrance was priceless. I kid you not when I tell you that it is worth shelling out the ten bucks just for his performance alone. Think of him as a Raoul Duke toned down for the Disney audience. As for the rest of the movie, I found it very enjoyable and the only thing that I'd complain about is the length which was a tad bit much. You start feeling it a little after the two hour mark. Also, there's something about a Bruckheimer produced movie that makes me want to throttle the man. It gives the movie a slightly canned, 'Bruckheimer Style' flavor that makes me want to jam a finger down my throat and purge Monty Python's Meaning of Life style. The music, the chaotic action, I don't know. I'll say it upfront, I don't like the man but you probably figured that out already. Keira Knightley is damn fine. Thank god seventeen is legal in New York because I was kind of starting to feel bad thinking about how I would have liked to plunder her treasure. Filthiness aside, she played her part well, though her character's importance became irrelevant after the halfway mark. Orlando Bloom, while well cast, needs to be given a part that stretches his abilities a bit more. With a two hour plus runtime, there was no excuse for not having his character fully fleshed out and simply having him stare angrily at any of the villains. Maybe I'm wrong but I just felt he was sadly under used. Speaking of villains, Geoffrey Rush seems to be perfect in these types of scenery chewing, teeth gnashing roles. His performance here reminded me of his unapologetic performance in 'House on Haunted Hill', the best thing about that particular movie. He makes for a good bad guy, so much that you never really hate him. He's a joy to watch as well. The direction by Gore Verbinski was surehanded and whoever was responsible for the writing gets kudos also. I found myself laughing a lot more than I thought I would, believe it or not. The action was pretty chaotic but on occasion goes on for longer than it should. The special effects were pretty good but I think ILM has been falling off as of late. I'm not trashing their work but it just seems uninspired these past few films (cough... cough...Dreamcatcher... cough) In the end, it's Depp's picture all the way. Thankfully this movie knows that it's supposed to be fun and not self-important. Not a bad way to spend two and a half hours. And if you do end up watching this and you don't enjoy hearing Captain Jack Sparrow slur every other word, I don't know what else to tell you. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,1,9 July 2003
Finding Nemo," I loved it, I loved it, I loved it! What movie are we talking about again?
","If you or any children you know have enjoyed a Pixar movie in the slightest, you owe it to yourself and them to go see this amazing movie. It is literally laugh out loud funny. I thought that Ellen DeGeneres was a hoot and her character alone is worth seeing the movie for. Kudos to Pixar on getting such a wonderfully talented actress to play this role, as well as all of the others involved. Each character that is introduced throughout leaves you smiling. There wasn't one scene in this movie where I was bored with what was happening. It is surprisingly intense in some scenes, the shark scene coming to mind as I write this. The beginning of the movie is pretty dark as well but I won't reveal what happens except to say that it is a pretty grim way to start what is widely seen to be a kid's flick. In terms of technical achievements, the sound was awesome with directional effects coming at you from every which direction. The picture is unbelievable and even the most jaded viewer won't be able to help marvelling at how lifelike all of the characters are. The whole time I was watching the movie, I kept thinking to myself, 'DVD? Hell yeah!' The story is just as good, if not better than any previous Pixar movie. What amazed me the most about this movie was the wealth of ideas that they had going on in it! I remember watching the trailer and thinking to myself, 'How much stuff can they actually do underwater that we haven't already seen in other movies?' Trust me when I say you will be surprised at the overall creative brilliance of this fine film. It's very obvious that some serious brainstorming was going on during the planning stages. Pixar has one hell of a streak going on right now with Finding Nemo only strengthening their already impressive body of films and I cannot recommend this one enough. (Final note: my favorite scene was Gill (Willem Dafoe) describing his escape plan to the other fish in the aquarium. It had me in tears from laughing so hard!)

Blade," Gotta love those rapping Japanese schoolgirls!
","I'll say it upfront: I LOVE this movie. A half-human, half-vampire walking around slaughtering vampires without any kind of second thoughts. Now that's not to say that I run around dressed like Wesley Snipes, putting stakes in people after kicking them in the head a couple of times. It's just that, there's a lot to like in this movie. I normally don't dig Wesley Snipes too much but he is the man in this flick. His intro is one of the best as far as these kinds of movies go. That's another thing: that club scene in the beginning, who doesn't think it's an amazing scene? It sets the tone so perfectly and yet, the rest of the movie manages to stay on the level without dropping off. Kris Kristofferson is much better used here than he was in the sequel. N'Bushe Wright is great, I'm hoping she comes back for the third outing as she was missing from the second. I really dug Stephen Dorff and Donal Logue; they were great villains. Genuine menace and humor from both. There were genuinely scary moments in this, crazy plot twists, great splashes of gore, exciting action sequences, funny one liners, awesome special effects, mindless entertainment... Finally, a mature-themed comic-book movie that was done right! Seriously, what do people expect when watching this? It's not a perfect movie but it's damn well-made! Not to mention the DVD is still one of the best buys at the time of this writing. Rating **** out of *****.",Null,0,1,28 October 2002
The Terminator," 30 cops? No problem!
","I saw the Terminator at my old neighborhood theater, the Alpine. It was the kind of theater where the occasional stray cat would run across the bottom of the screen on a Saturday night followed by one or two of his pals. It was the kind of theater where your shoe might stick to the carpet from all the spilled soda. It was the kind of theater where the occasional shootout had been known to happen, thankfully never while I visited. It was the last movie I got to see there because after it's run, they replaced it with 'Cooley High' and 'Them', the last two movies that would ever be shown there. The theater was torn down to make way for a McDonalds, which is still there to this day. I guess the reason I'm telling you, dear IMDB user, about the theater is because it was a symbol of 'the old days' for me. I was ten years old when I saw the Terminator, nineteen years ago. Thinking about that fact while watching T3 two days ago made me feel a little sad, especially when it dawned on me that I had watched that movie and it's two sequels with one my oldest and closest friends. Sad to say, I think the state of movies these days has dwindled. I remember going to the movies in those years not only to see great special effects and unflinching violence (cut me some slack, I was a kid then; what kid didn't love movie violence?) but with the sincere hopes that I would be hypnotized by a great story. These days, it's rare that you actually get that. You might get some astounding special effects wrapped around a thin shell of a 'story' and that's if you're lucky. The Terminator was one of those movies that blew me away when I first saw it and it did so with an intensity that still rivals most action movies I have seen ever since.I'm not going to go into plot details because honestly, if you're reading this, I think you know what to expect already. For those out of the loop, just know that this is the movie that made Schwarzenegger and that's no exaggeration. The definition of ruthless in the dictionary should have a picture of him from the movie right next to it. I remember watching this movie and the feeling I got, when he went into the police station and mowed down everyone and their mothers who even dared to stand up and get in his way is still a feeling I get when I watch that scene, almost twenty years later. Not that I enjoy seeing the cops bite it in fantasy or reality but the thrill of watching an unstoppable killing machine destroy everything in it's path with such frightening single-mindedness in achieving it's goals.... it's really something else. This is one of those movies that I have never gotten tired of. It's a B-movie but a B-movie with heart. There's a reason that it was voted one of the ten best movies of the '80s and it's because it's infinitely rewatchable. All of the characters are memorable in this. The only gripe that I have with the flick is that the special effects haven't held up all that well and to be truthful, they were never really that good to begin with, even back in '84. It doesn't detract much though because this movie grabs you from it's opening shot and never lets you go. This movie isn't about how cool the effects are or how much action it has. It's a movie with a great story that doesn't get overwhelmed by anything else. I love this movie and I can't recommend it enough. If you haven't seen this movie, stop reading this and go get the damn DVD. If you think the movie sucks I will gladly refund the $15 or so dollars. Just be prepared to give me a convincing explanation as to why you hated it.I hope that people reading this understand the sentimentality behind my review. There was a time when I used to enjoy looking forward to seeing movies on the big screen. I still enjoy the occasional movie in the theaters these days and it's funny how the really good ones are made on a smaller scale. I just feel like these days, it's all about how much of a budget gets approved and how much of it goes towards the film's big action set piece. That's fine and all but how about giving me a good story to go with it? Maybe one day, the flicks will recapture the imagination they once had without resorting to the ageing tactics employed today. Long live the Terminator, in all his stop-motion glory.RATING: ***** out of *****.",Null,2,3,3 July 2003
Snatch," Brad Pitt and that's pretty much it
","Sorry folks, namely those of you who were expecting something as refreshing as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. This movie was kinda weak and I'll try to explain why. Director Guy Ritchie mined the same resources he did for L,S & 2SB but does it lazily. Yeah, the movie's funny and has some good scenes but it just doesn't come together the way his previous film did. Vinnie Jones and Dennis Farina turn in standout performances but it's Brad Pitt who takes this one. Every scene that he's in makes you pay a little more attention because he's simply hilarious. This is definitely one of his most memorable roles and Fight Club fans will appreciate the similarities between his character here and his portrayal of wacko Tyler Durden. I'm hoping that Ritchie's next film won't be as much of a letdown as I'm not expecting to rush out and get the DVD for this like I did when L,S & 2SB's was released. **1/2 out of *****",Null,0,0,7 February 2001

Final Destination 2," BBQ, anyone?
","You'd think, reading some of these comments, that this movie is the greatest thing since Yamila Diaz. It's not. This movie really isn't good. If you look at it as a whole, you'll find it's less than the sum of it's parts. It gets pretty annoying at times, what with all the 'Death's Design' talk and blah blah blah. There's a point in the movie where you beg the people chattering away about Death's plan to shut up and go do something to get themselves killed already. Some of the acting sucks and the characters are all transparent and paper-thin. The first one is ten times better and achieves it's goal with a little more dignity and class. So, why then, after all I've said in regards to how schlocky this flick is, am I recommending it? I'll put it to you like this: PEOPLE GET IT IN THIS MOVIE. It's that simple. And it's not even that they get it, I mean they really get it. In extra bad ways, no less. For example, I'm sure that you've heard about the beginning of the film with the huge car crash/pile-up deal. It's the same setup as the first movie, where the kid dreams this whole airplane disaster only to wake up and find that it hasn't actually happened... yet. Small nuances of the premonition start to arise and he realizes that the plane he is about to fly on will actually explode. He freaks out, some of the passengers leave with him, plane blows up mid-flight, Death starts hunting the survivors down in the order they're supposed to die in, blah blah blah. If you're reading this review, you should already know the deal. Same thing here but with a twist. In the sequel, when the first person buys the farm in the sequence, you'll know that you're in completely different territory. I'll spare you the details cause I'd like you to be surprised but that moment shook me up real bad. Never before had I seen something so unsettlingly realistic. It reminded me of the test footage you see of those crash test dummies, it was that real. And then pretty much everyone else in the vicinity of that crash gets it, some worse than others. The movie is worth seeing just for the intro alone because it was pretty intense. Throughout the rest of the movie, everyone who was 'saved' from being in the accident starts getting bumped off. And how! People get it, folks and I think you owe it to yourself to catch this in a theater if it's possible. One thing that made this movie even more enjoyable was the crowd's reaction to the death scenes. It was like applause for an awards ceremony. To make it short and end this, see the movie if you wanna see people get greased in horrible ways. Don't watch this looking for an Oscar winner. Watch it for the visceral thrill of seeing someone get their ticket punched! I'm definitely getting the DVD, at least for that. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****. P.S. You'll never look at a family BBQ the same way again.",Null,0,0,4 March 2003
Blade II," Bite this and suck on it!
","I saw this in the movies, excited as all fudge. I loved the first one and felt it was the first superhero movie done right in years. This one looked to at least equal it's predecessor in every way imaginable. Watching this in the theater, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. Some of the fight scenes were ruined by CGI actors so obvious that it just hurt my feelings. The movie is bloody and really violent. It's really, really violent actually. People get slain in ways that defy description. Now I have no problem with that. It's just... there's just things in this movie that shouldn't have been here. All that rap/metal/techno feels really out of place, especially during the fight scenes. I feel that they should've stuck with the original score for those scenes. Watch the scene where he fights the two ninjas in his hideout. The music they use there is really good (but the scene is also a perfect example of bad CGI, cough, cough). But to have some Crystal Method's 'Name of the Game' during a half-inspired whoop-ass scene leaves you tapping your finger in Space Madness style. I don't know, ever since I got the DVD for my b'day, I've learned to appreciate the movie a little more. Those Reapers are really sweet. Luke Goss makes one hell of a bad guy. This movie is never boring. The action seems to go on forever. Wesley Snipes hams it up. Ron Perlman is a hero. Leonor Varela can bite me cause I'm into that. Norman Reedus should get slapped for this but I don't think it's his fault that they gave him a crap role to work with. I really liked him in Boondock Saints, if you want more of him. The film's biggest waste was Kris Kristofferson. Blade kills a whole bunch of suckheads to free Whistler. And for what, to have Whistler throw him his sunglasses at the end? He does almost nothing in this movie. Hopefully, the third one'll be better. I'll give this one **1/2 out of ***** only because of some impressive design. Oh, Guillermo Del Toro did a really good job behind the wheel here. The movie failed but it was a noble failure. Sort of.... ugggh....",Null,0,1,14 October 2002
Closer," Closer than you might feel comfortable with
","Watched this last night and loved it. This movie is perfect for those that are pretty familiar with the constant b.s. that goes on in relationships and anyone who has ever dealt with situations even remotely similar to what the characters in the movie go through. Mike Nichols does a great job directing this film about two couples who basically crash into each other's lives and spend the rest of the film trying to pry themselves from the wreckage and move on. The acting in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. Even though at times the dialogue is spoken as if it would've been more at home on a stage, that detail can be overlooked because the story was originally written as a play. Everyone turns in a pitch perfect performance but in the end, the movie belongs to Natalie Portman who I think we can all agree has grown up. Her presence in this film is so powerful that you can just feel her around even in the scenes that she's not in. Jude Law deserves a mention because he can play the good guy or the scuzzball and delivers consistently. He plays a real bastard in this, so all you girls who adore him might want to avoid this, along with his more dentally challenged role in 'Road to Perdition'. Julia Roberts felt very natural for the part as did Clive Owen, who was great as the guy who gets his heart broken. Speaking of which, the movie is a very painful experience. I think it is one of the more accurate representations of just how selfish people can be when it comes to their needs and desires. To sum it up as best as I can, if you've ever had your heart broken, believe me you'll relate with one or even all of the characters in this film. Watching this is like watching someone you know sacrifice their dignity for someone who doesn't deserve it.I can't recommend this film enough and it's a great example of how a film without any action can grab you just with the power of the spoken word.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.P.S. **MINOR SPOILER AHEAD** If there was one problem I had with the movie, it was just that I couldn't buy the whole thing about Natalie Portman's character not ever revealing her real name to Jude Law in all the time they were together. The way it looked to me in the movie, she was really in love with the guy and was willing to take a lot of crap from him. I just couldn't swallow it completely but in the end, it still played out nicely when Jude realized he'd been duped.",9,4,5,30 April 2005

If you've never seen what it looks like when five men empty all their ammunition into a wooded area, then look no further. This is a great action/ sci-fi movie and easily one of Arnold's better entries. It's not the smartest kid in the class but not a complete waste of time. Yeah it's a bit goofy at times but what do you expect? Besides, who can get enough of Apollo Creed? A definite Saturday night hit. ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,0,9 September 2002
Léon: The Professional," My AIM screenname is Stansfield12. What does that tell you?
","Gary Oldman is a God. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, let's concentrate on some of the finer points of this film, in a stream-of-consciousness styled fashion. Great score by Eric Serra. Great direction by Luc Besson. Natalie Portman gives a standout performance here and she's going to get nominated for an Oscar before this decade (the '00s) is up. If I'm wrong, send a hitman out to get me. Jean Reno plays pretty much the same guy he did in La Femme Nikita but I'm not complaining! Oldman as DEA nutcase Norman Stansfield, gets serious consideration as being the greatest screen villain of all time. The uncut version makes him even more of a menace, for those who haven't seen it. The uncut version also makes Danny Aiello's character a little more respectable. I hated him in the theatrical version, I sympathized with him here. What the main difference is between the uncut and the theatrical versions is the relationship between Leon and Matilda. They cut the film down to avoid any kind of controversy because admittedly, some of the stuff might've upset a few ding-dongs here. I for one, think that the restored footage is handled delicately and with a sense of respect for the actors and the subject. Some might've found it creepy, I thought it was daring and original, without delving into the kiddie-porn stylings of a movie like Kids or Bully (which, incidentally, are both great movies if you view them from a certain perspective). It's not like there was any exploitative material here, it's just that Leon and Matilda's scenes are a little more intimate, I'd say. This is a movie to see, especially for film aficionados. Watch them both and you can learn a lot about filmmaking by observing the cuts made and what stayed intact. The movie might drag in some places but not often enough for you to freak out over it. It's a shame that this movie wasn't released in it's entirety. Maybe more people would've appreciated the intended vision of Luc Besson. Give this guy final cut if he doesn't already have it!

","The movie was good right up until the moment where (SPOILER ALERT: STOP READING NOW! IF YOU'VE SEEN THIS OR DON'T CARE REGARDLESS, CONTINUE ON) Matt Affleck rides this guy down the center of a looping staircase, you know the kind I mean? He basically lays across the guys back on his chest and holds on by his collar. Oh yeah, he shoots someone on the way down also. Now... one or two flights maybe. But not five or six. You've gotta be kidding me. And he gets up and walks away with a slight limp. Not only that, the fx in that moment were really bad. You could clearly see that it was an insert. Whatever. That moment kinda screwed the movie up for me. It's a good movie but that scene.... ugggh. My tummy hurts just thinking about it.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Lord of my Goddamn DVD Player
","I'm going to keep this as short as I can because, I really can't say anymore than what's already been said. This movie is simply astounding. Special effects, acting, action sequences, story pace... how the hell can anyone complain? I can accept other people's opinions but if you can't appreciate the love and care that director Peter Jackson has made this film with in regards to the original source, then you are a serious grump, for lack of a better word. For one, there is absolutely no way to make a 100% faithful movie of the books. There is way too much detail and the movie would've clocked in at ten and a half hours. Yeah, I was disappointed that some things were left out but what's important is that the feeling of the book was kept intact. And how can anyone complain when so many tiny details were put into the film that could have easily been left out? Legolas walking on the surface of the snow while the others trudge through it, waist deep? Bill the Pony? Must I go on? All I can say is, at least they allowed someone that has obvious respect for the book to have made a film of it, other than the new director on the block who never knew the book existed in the first place. Tolkien purists, you guys need to relax. This is as good as it's ever going to get and if you can look me straight in the eye and tell me that you don't get chills watching Boromir come running to the aid of Merry and Pippin or watching the entire Mines of Moria sequence or even the prologue showing the path of the One Ring, you're only lying to yourself.

The Matrix Revolutions," You have something in your eyes, let me burn them out for you
","WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW:I have to say, that I really like this movie. I don't necessarily love it but at the same time, it gets lots more playtime in my DVD player than Reloaded does. I've heard a lot of complaints about this film but I feel that it is the better of the two sequels for multiple reasons, even if it is still flawed in some ways. Wanna hear why? In keeping with the style of my review for Reloaded, here's my three point breakdown:THINGS THAT REALLY SUCKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE:<ul><li>No Gloria Foster. No matter how you cut it, the fact that she's gone just flat out sucks. Mary Alice does a great job in filling the role but the fact that the change is never explained in a satisfying way definitely hurts the movie. - Sati, the little Indian kid. I always feel bad when criticizing the performance of a child in a film but let's face it, she just wasn't that good. Cute but... no. - Trinity's Goodbye Speech. The filmmakers should have realized that this was going on a bit too long. When you're secretly wishing for one of the story's main characters to die so they can shut their trap already, that isn't a very good thing. - Morpheus becoming little more than a supporting character. What does he do in this movie? A lot less than he does in Reloaded, that's what. - Some more wooden acting. Again, I am not naming names.</li></ul>THINGS THAT KINDA SUCKED BUT WERE ALSO KIND OF COOL:<ul><li>The Superbrawl between Neo and Smith. This is a pretty interesting two sided coin we have here. The movie simultaneously gives you a fight that the makers of the next Superman will have to work pretty hard to top and also ends up dragging it out a little longer than it needed to be. It reaches a certain point where you just want it to end already and being that this is probably the most important moment of the movie, it is kind of disappointing to feel that way when you shouldn't. - Not having all of your questions answered by the end. They managed to tie up the trilogy in a satisfying way more or less, but I was still left scratching my head afterwards when it came to certain questions I had. I'm not going to waste space listing them all but if you want an example of one such question, I'd really like to know what the hell that was all about when the ghost of that Sentinel went through Neo while he and Trinity were heading to the Machine City? Hello? Anybody? While I don't think it's absolutely necessary to answer EVERY question in a movie, this one seemed to leave one loose end too many. - Neo losing his sight by way of a severed electrical cable. I have mixed feelings about this and it does suck but not necessarily in a bad way. It doesn't suck in that it was executed poorly or something like that but it sucks in that it is one of the most horrifying things I have ever seen happen to someone in a movie and it happens to the hero of the film. Losing my eyesight is one of my biggest fears and this just disturbed me to no end. I'm not docking the movie any rating points for this but I just had to bring it up because it is one of the things that stick out the most for me when I recount the movie. It's a great scene but it's the one moment in the movie where I really felt for Neo. From that moment on, you know that it isn't going to end happily for everyone in general. It just sucks in that way that it does when a film's protagonist gets injured really badly. Like Boromir at the end of Fellowhip of the Rings. - Not enough events taking place in the Matrix. I would've liked to see more stuff happen within the lovely green tinted world of the Matrix but then again, the important thing in the story really is the fight of the Zion inhabitants to survive, so I guess I can deal with the fact that most of this film takes place in the real world. - Lobby Shootout Part Two. Think of the Lobby Shootout from the first one but instead of SWAT guys, you have S&amp;M club bouncers running along the ceiling letting off shots. You somehow get the sense that they were trying to update and top the shootout from the first Matrix but it doesn't quite work. It's a cool scene but suffers from being in the shadow of the original. - The Kid/ Clayton Watson. He wasn't grating as he was in Reloaded but I was kind of led to believe that this guy was going to have some major role to play in the film due to the fact that he got his own story in the Animatrix. Something about the way his role was set up in the film distracted me a little bit. I wasn't exactly sure what to make of him but at least he came through when they needed him most. </li></ul>THINGS THAT WERE REALLY COOL ABOUT THIS MOVIE:<ul><li>Seraph/ Collin Chou. Yeah, he makes his first appearance in Reloaded but I thought he really shined here. - Neo in the Machine City. Everything from getting there to his meeting with the machine leader. The whole idea of that scene was pretty cool and it's interesting to see the conflict from the side of the 'enemy' for a moment. - Smith/ Hugo Weaving. I don't really need to go into why, do I? - The attack on Zion. Exhausting to watch? Sure. Entertaining? You bet. Robot suits, machine guns, screaming, explosions, savagery committed by machines and humans alike, it's all here. My favorite moment: The 'Hand of God' scene where that rush of Sentinels spills out of the hole from the ceiling of the dock, becoming a massive force of destruction. Still gets me every time. - Bane/ Ian Bliss. His impersonation of Hugo Weaving is one of the best things about the movie. You have to give this guy his props for his work here. - The Flight of the Hammer. This scene is awesome and easily Jada Pinkett Smith's best moment in the two sequels. - Neodammerung, the music that played over the Superbrawl. I think it compliments the on screen action really well. - Lock/ Harry Lennix. Very good performance. You gotta love an actor who can make you genuinely hate him. - The overall sense of defeat that grows and grows through the movie. I love movies that are kind of depressing to watch like this one is. You know while watching this movie that you're not going to get a perfect, happy ending. What were they gonna do, free everyone from the Matrix and live under a nice, dark sky without the Machines bothering them? I'm glad that didn't happen because if it did, this movie would've sucked big time. I liked the fact that the Wachowskis weren't afraid to cave in to the Hollywood standard of happy endings with no strings. - That moment where Trinity sees the unclouded sky for the first time. It's the one moment of the movie that really gives you the message of the movie.</li></ul>CONCLUSION:A fitting end to the trilogy, even though we all wished, maybe unreasonably, for cinematic perfection. I like this movie for many different reasons and though I wish that the entire trilogy lived up to the standard set by the first, it still managed to be a very inventive and entertaining series. I feel that Revolutions succeeds, especially in its dumping of all the boring psychobabble that weighed Reloaded down in favor of the goods. A somewhat anticlimactic ending and some crappy acting keep the movie from being better than it could've been but not by much. In it's defense, it feels like a more complete movie then Reloaded does, regardless of it being one half of a big movie split down the middle. I would actually like to see another Matrix trilogy at some point in the future. I'm pretty sure with the advance of technology in films today that they can expand the world of the Matrix and make it even richer. Lastly, I think the sequels need to be seen at least twice to be able to appreciate them at all. Rating: ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,0,30 October 2004
The Thing," 'I'd rather not spend the rest of this winter TIED TO THIS F******* COUCH!'
","This is one of those movies that give me a feeling of nostalgia like few others. I remember being a kid and watching this over and over on video and on cable whenever it aired.Some would say that this is Carpenter's best work and it's tough to argue against that point because it's such a great film. It succeeds at creating this mood that's so palpable that I can only think of a few horror films released after this that achieve the same effect. I love the feeling of despair in this film, especially when the team realizes that they're not going to make it off of the outpost alive. You never know who's going to be next in line to become a mess of tentacles, teeth and slime and you never know who's going to bite it. The true horror of the situation that these men find themselves in is captured perfectly through the skillful direction of Carpenter, the acting by the uniformly excellent cast and the music by Ennio Morricone, which helps to seal the deal.The special effects by Rob Bottin still hold up even after the nearly twenty five years since the film's release. This film has one (actually, I should say several because this thing never looks the same every time it appears) of the most wildly imaginative designs for a space creature that I've ever seen.There are many scenes in the film that are classics, my favorite being the initial discovery of the creature manifested as a dog. It's one of the most revolting scenes ever, in my opinion. Another fantastic scene is the blood test scene that somehow manages to make me jump occasionally, even though I know when the big reveal is coming. The ambiguous ending is one of the best ever. We will probably never know just how things ended up* (see below), will we? This is another grade-A effort from Carpenter and I applaud him for this one. Highly recommended! RATING ***** out of *****.NOTE* They made a video game for the Xbox which was considered an official sequel to the film and it actually does answer the question of who survived. But I'm not telling!",10,1,2,1 June 2006
The Hills Have Eyes," The Hills Have Eyes.... and murderous mutants with axes and other nasty weapons
","SLIGHT SPOILERS: I just came from seeing a sneak preview of The Hills Have Eyes and the first thing I have to say is that this movie beats Hostel easily for Most Brutal Movie of the year award. This movie is one rough ride and once it really gets going, it doesn't stop. I want to keep this review short but I will touch on a couple of things worth mentioning: - I felt very tense watching this. For the first hour or so, my stomach was twisted into a tight knot. It's been a while since a movie's done that to me. The suspense as things slowly unfold is extremely well done.<ul><li>The acting is actually pretty good on all counts, especially in the case of Aaron Stanford who is excellent in this. The audience went berserk for him at one point and I was clapping along with everyone else, especially at this one point at the very end.</li></ul><ul><li>Some very sadistic violence. If watching well meaning, innocent people get it in different ways is not your thing, then look elsewhere. This is a film about tragedy and injustice and the film pulls no punches when it comes to dispatching people, mutated or not. Even after people are killed, they still get disrespected.</li></ul><ul><li>Great special effects. The make up on some of the characters is downright disturbing.</li></ul><ul><li>Director Aja more than made up for the piece of crap that was 'Haute Tension'.</li></ul><ul><li>The rape scene isn't as bad as you have been led to believe.</li></ul><ul><li>This movie suffers from one of those things I absolutely hate about horror movies: characters doing absolutely idiotic things. You know what I mean, going off to inspect things by yourself, leaving weapons near seemingly dead killers, etc, etc. It happens several times and each time it's just more annoying.</li></ul>I really enjoyed this film and I think that word of mouth is going to carry this movie for a big opening weekend. This is one for the gorehounds and I honestly don't think that anyone with an appreciation for horror flicks will walk away disappointed.In the end, I'm just happy that horror movies are beginning to get some balls again.Strongly recommended.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",7,0,2,9 March 2006
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," This movie sucked!!! I mean it really sucked!!!
","Good. Now that I've gotten your attention, I'd like to say a few things about the movie, which I had the pleasure of watching last night.
I LOVED IT! Let me get some minor quibbles out first.It's immediately apparent while you're watching the movie that Cameron's touch is missing. There's something about watching a Cameron movie that never lets you forget who it is that's directing it. I think the one detail that makes it the most obvious in this flick is the acting. I've heard that Cameron is a real stickler for getting a performance out of someone in the exact way that he wants it and say what you want about the first two Terminator movies but the acting was excellent across the board on the both of them, save for the corny emotional moments that popped up from time to time in the second one. I kind of felt like the acting in this installment was not really focused upon. Don't get me wrong, it's actually pretty good, especially Nick Stahl as a worn down John Connor. Overall though, it sometimes felt like I was watching an original Sci-Fi channel movie on occasion. Other gripes I had with the flick were the occasional 'funny' moment that was anything but. There were a couple of holes that left me shaking my head (case in point, when John and Kate (Claire Danes) go to see her father at Skynet, I would've thought that getting into a military installation with loads of weapons would've proven more difficult than just walking in but again, it's forgivable). The T-X made for a good villain but hats off to Robert Patrick's T-1000. Aside from Arnold's original Terminator, he made for the most menacing Terminator yet. I will give Ms. Loken her props, she was convincingly ruthless when executing her victims.Enough with the gripes. Let me tell you what makes this movie fantastic. Let's just get it out of the way right now and say that the action in this movie is jaw-dropping. The future scenes were awesomely realized. That chase you've seen in the trailers with the crane truck and Arnold swinging off of it? THAT ONE SCENE DESTROYS THE MUCH HERALDED CHASE SCENE IN MATRIX RELOADED. And that's just one of the scenes. There is a lesson to be learned here, filmmakers. The less CG effects you use, the more realistic everything becomes. Remember that truck chase in the canal in T2? Exactly. While the Matrix did show off some nifty little effects, the sense of danger achieved in the T3 chase is much greater because of one simple thing. Most of it was done for real with real, bonafide stuntwork. The CG that was used in the sequence isn't painfully obvious when you look at it and like other CG heavy action movies, doesn't take you out of the realism. And isn't heightening the sense of fear and danger for our heroes the main goal here? As of late, I think too many movies are depending on CG these days to sell them and I give this movie a big thumbs up just for keeping the CG use down to practical levels. This movie is loaded with action and unlike T2, it never drags. T2 is an amazing film accomplishment but you've gotta admit that the middle of the movie is a bit too slow. Not here. There's enough action here to keep anyone satisfied but thankfully it doesn't go into the 'too much action' territory that films like 'The Mummy Returns' have ventured into, only to come out with headache inducing results. The movie clocks in at just under two hours, a perfect length for the story presented. As for the story, you'll walk out of the theater realizing that this movie was done with a great amount of respect for it's predecessors. I don't want to give away any details but trust me when I say that this film fits in perfectly with the other two. There's a sense of despair and dread that grows and grows until ultimately, you realize the scope of what's being played out before you. I loved it and I'm really happy with the way the story turned out. I liked all of those little ideas and nuances that pop up and make you smile in wonder. It may not be as 'smart' as the second was but it still holds it's own.I never got the sense that this movie was made strictly for monetary purposes and that in itself makes this film an above average sequel. How many sequels are actually above average, let alone a second sequel? I love the fact that director Johnathan Mostow pulled through with this. I, like many others, was very skeptical about whether or not he could pull it off and believe me, he does. Cameron might've been able to deliver a tighter film but this movie doesn't ruin the memory of the first two for me, so I'm not going to complain. I don't know if I've covered enough in this review but I'll just finish by saying that Arnold does not disappoint with what has become over the years, his signature role. He plays the role so comfortably that it's hard to believe that it's been over ten years since we last saw him. One-liners aside, it's good to have you back, Mr. S.

"I, Robot"," I, Surprised
","I'm not big on Will Smith. There's a smarminess to him that I can't stomach. Don't get me wrong, I mean, he seems like he'd be really cool in person. It's when he plays those cocky characters that think they are the best thing since the invention of sliced bread that I start to get annoyed. If you want the perfect example, check out his work in Bad Boys 2. God, just the thought of it makes me want to go out and leap off a bridge. Anyway, I avoided seeing this movie in theaters because it looked like your typical 'Will Smith playing a bad ass unconvincingly' movie.I recently caught this on DVD and I have to say that I actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. As expected, Big Willie Style is groan-inducing in almost every scene he's in but the movie as a whole is not that bad. There were a couple of moments in the film that left me nearly breathless. The first was a scene where he's inside a house that gets demolished by this big construction robot. Wow. Though it screamed fake-CGI, it was pretty intense. It was one of the narrowest escapes I have ever seen in a movie next to the Indiana Jones series.Speaking of intense, the scene where he is attacked on the highway by two trucks loaded with robots was unbelievable. I don't think I blinked once watching this scene. The effects were pretty impressive but synthetic looking at the same time. I almost bought the DVD for this scene alone. It's perfect to show off your home entertainment center if you have a decent setup.There were little twists in the story that really surprised me. I don't really want to spoil them for whoever is reading this so I won't bother listing them. The movie was also pretty funny in spots. The future setting is very well realized and the special effects, especially on the robots, were done very well. I thought the movie raised some interesting questions under its slam bang action movie exterior, especially in the ethics of artificial intelligence. Towards the end, it got just a bit confusing but not so much that it took away from the story.As for Will Smith, I thought that he was slightly annoying for the most part but he had one or two moments where I actually felt for his character. Will is a great actor, I just wish he'd stop trying to prove to everyone how 'down' he is. There's something about his swagger and cockiness that just feels forced to me. At any rate, this movie made me curious to see what his next outing will be.RATING: *** out of *****.",Null,0,0,4 January 2005
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," ...and for my next trick, I'm going to stick my needle-like finger into the corner of your eye!
","I was a huge Terminator fan when I was about ten years old, in case you didn't read my earlier review of it. I used to imagine that I was Reese, coming back from the future, saving Sarah Connor and all that. Me and my friend Adrian watched the movie on VHS in it's entirety at least twice a day for the duration of one summer, then rewound to the police station scene to watch Arnold give all of those poor, doomed police officers hell. Needless to say, we liked the movie somewhat.Then in 1991, we went to see the sequel, the day before it was being released nationally.I remember sitting through the opening future sequence with my jaw on my lap thinking to myself, 'If only the first one had these effects.' From then on, it was another two hours plus of pure Terminator bliss. Me and Adrian walked out of the theater laughing hysterically, happy that we had new fodder to abuse on the VCR (well, we'd have to wait a bit but ultimately, we got it pretty quick).This is one of those rare cases of a sequel done right. The film does have a couple of problems but nothing that ruins it overall. Everything was taken from its original minimalist approach and pumped up to the maximum. The action scenes were without a doubt, unbelievable. The acting was uniformly great, every character given life with none of them being under developed. The story was surprisingly emotional. Just the fact that I wanted to cry for a cyborg that was getting trashed really bad at one point, I'll give Cameron his credit. Especially when mentioning the performance of Linda Hamilton, who was a shivering coward in the first one. You see her here, it's like looking into the eyes of a caged animal. If memory serves me, she wasn't nominated for this performance and it's just a crying shame. The special effects... wow. At the time, morphing had just been unleashed and this movie, believe it or not, basically set the standards for the special effects that you're seeing today. You have to understand that watching this when it was first released was nothing short of breathtaking. It was almost as if somewhere in the recesses of your brain, you somehow knew that you were being a witness to history. I'll never forget watching this in the theaters that first night, how the audience reacted to the emergence of the T-1000 (Robert Patrick) from the blazing wreck of the tow truck in the canal. I swear you could've heard people hold their breath for a moment, then breaking out into thundering applause and hoots and hollers when he morphed into his human self. The film was filled with moments like this and I feel that's why it's such an enduring flick. If you haven't seen this, you really need to stop looking up reader reviews on IMDB and get yourself a video rental card or something. Get with it, man!Which leads me to the inevitable question. How does it hold up to the big, bad original? Well, I've gotta say that I love both movies. After reading my above thoughts on the movie, you may be surprised to hear that I actually prefer the original. As great as the sequel is, the grittiness of the first one is what does it for me. Yeah, T2 had everything plus the kitchen sink thrown in but the first one had this feeling to it, this feeling of death, darkness and destruction. For some reason while writing this, I thought of this analogy to sum up what I think about the differing moods of the movie: T2 was a crystal clear, beautiful, streak-free window. The first Terminator was the same window with a dirty, dingy rock thrown through it. I think it makes sense. You could probably attribute the griminess of the first one to its low budget roots but that's what makes it work so much better. The sequel is a bit too crisp, too neat, too clean. Don't get me wrong, the film looks great but then again, I'm the kind of person that loves the murkiness of Se7en.Another thing, and this is where my main beef lies. Some people like the new and improved minigun wielding Terminator. The shoot 'em in the knees in order to spare them their lives Terminator. The joke-cracking Terminator. I am not one of those people. I like the quiet Terminator. The one that speaks only when he absolutely needs to. The Terminator that drives a car through the front lobby of a police station and comes out holding an assault rifle and an automatic shotgun. The one that absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. The sequel's Terminator is a little more PC and given the general message of the sequel, requires him to be so. But taking away from this character what made him so popular the first time around kind of tips the scales in the original's favor, in my opinion anyway.
There are a few other things that make me like the original better than the sequel as well. For instance, the runtime for T2 is pretty hefty with a middle section that drags a bit, where the first one is nice and lean, with no slow parts whatsoever. I remember while watching the movie initially, I got annoyed a couple of times near the end. The violence, while still strong, isn't on the level of the first. There's a preachiness to the sequel that gets annoying at times. What it speaks of is of great importance, true, but there's moments in T2 that almost made me roll my eyes. Edward Furlong, here playing the young John Connor, gives a good performance but comes off as whiny more often than he should. His voice squeaks in a way that sounds like nails on a chalkboard on occasion. I'll cut him some slack though, being that he was probably just going through puberty at the time of filming.I've probably spent more time than I should have on comparing the two films. I'll finish with this: T2 is an amazing motion picture. If you are an action fan, this is a movie for you to see. It holds up well to repeat viewings and has some amazing special effects, with a villain that goes down as one of the more memorable I can think of. It's rare nowadays to get a movie that has this amount of special effects that weren't thrown in just for the sake of it. The special effects serve the story and push it forward, like it's supposed to do. The story is emotionally heavy and will definitely make you think of technology advancement in our age in a different way.
Lastly, it's one of those few sequels that actually doesn't ruin the memory of the first film. That in itself, says something, I think.

Face_Off," Well, at least they didn't feed their faces to the dogs...
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS: DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THIS FREE OF ANY DESCRIPTION OF PLOT DETAILSThe highlight of this movie is watching both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage playing their respective characters and then switch roles part of the way through. Travolta plays Sean Archer, a G-man hunting down a nasty terrorist named Castor Troy, played by Nicholas Cage. The beginning of the movie shows Castor Troy attempting to assassinate Archer, who is on a carousel with his young son, only to accidentally kill the little boy in the process. It is a heartbreaking scene and sets up the serious jones that Archer has for getting his hands on the guy quite well. After a watered down but still frenetic John Woo style shootout in a hangar, Archer manages to catch his man when Troy ends up in a coma from a hard hit. Problems ensue when the authorities find out that Castor and his beloved brother Pollux, who was captured during the shootout, have planted a biological thingamajig somewhere in the city that's set to blow at an unspecified time and only Pollux knows where it is and he ain't talking from the prison he's locked up in. Desperate, a couple of higher-ups devise a plan to have Archer and Troy switch places by means of a radical new surgery procedure to get Archer to divulge the specifics of the bomb's location and it's detonation time. Basically, they take one guy's face right off and slap it on the other guy's freshly skinned face, along with several other body shaping methods. This is the point where if you don't suspend your disbelief, you're going to be in for a painful sitting. I agree, the whole concept is ridiculous. I read an interview with a neurosurgeon or someone similar who was asked to give his opinions on the surgical operation in the movie. He said something along the lines of how lasering the face off of someone is likely to cause an incurable amount of trauma, something which was readily apparent to me when I initially saw the movie. The rest of the movie has Cage playing the good guy and it's pretty interesting to see how well he plays it. Travolta gets kudos as well and even manages to produce several laughs by making fun of his own physicality when playing Troy. I enjoyed the movie, though I felt it wasn't true John Woo. As far as the action goes, yeah it's fine. People don't run out of bullets at all. People use two handguns at the same time. People pull guns out of nowhere just when you think they had no more guns to spare. The movie is actually pretty violent but the action is nowhere near as good as Woo's original Hong Kong stuff. I felt that the movie dragged in certain places as well and the runtime is a bit long. The thing that makes the overall film work, as I said before, are the over-the-top performances of both Cage and Travolta. It's great to see them basically mimic each other down to the tee. If anything, the least you will walk away from this movie with is admiration for the two. Say what you will about either one but they managed to prove just how good they are at their craft with this film.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,1,17 July 2003
54," Utterly and completely painful
","My older sister was part of the 54 crowd and after seeing the movie, she looked at me and shook her head silently, her mouth turned down into a look of disgust. She asked me if the director had ever even been there. I had seen an interview on MTV with him where he said he hadn't ever been and I think that's where the problem lies with this movie. I rented this one on VHS and afterwards, I couldn't help feeling like this was given to the wrong guy to direct. No offense to anyone but the movie was obviously directed by a gay guy who was more interested in filming how hot the men looked than in the actual club itself. I don't mind seeing that kind of stuff in movies but in this one it just seemed like the focus was mainly set on that aspect of the era and I felt that not enough attention was being paid to the myth of the club. As you may or may not know, Studio 54 was a legend in it's own time. There was a lot more that could have been done with this movie, other than release this hack product. This could have been an epic masterpiece, not an undernourished crock. Come on, how could this movie clock in at just above an hour and a half? This could have easily been an entertaining three hour movie that would have covered the rise and fall of this famous nightspot in rich detail. It seems that no one else involved with the movie thought so because the movie seems preoccupied with meaningless accuracies and weak characters. This movie just could have been something special. Hell, Boogie Nights got it right. They should have let Paul Thomas Anderson do this one, he probably would've turned something out that would've been watchable. Maybe it wasn't the director's fault, maybe it was the work of meddling producers that caused this film to explode but I can honestly say that just from the endless stories my sis had told me of 54, they got this one all wrong. Maybe we'll see another 54 film in the future but after this crockery, I doubt anyone will get excited about it with the taste of this one still lingering. The acting by nearly all of the principals is horrendous. I like Ryan Philiipe actually but not here. Way of the Gun was more like it. Neve Campbell seems to have exhausted her bag of tricks because I thought she was still playing Sydney from Scream. The only positive thing I can possibly say is that the movie has a great soundtrack, even though it could've used a couple more tracks that 54 was known to play regularly. It's a little run-of-the-mill but contains a couple of the essentials. And lastly, Mike Myers delivers a knockout performance that hints at what this movie could have been if it had been done properly. He's the only one that walks out of this one unscathed. Everyone else, head to the showers and take a bath cause you stink! I didn't even rewind the tape when I brought it back to the video store that's how disgusted I was! I will never watch this horse pucky again. Unless, I wish to inflict further trauma on my already damaged brain. And I'll say it again, with the exception of Mike Myers, if you were involved in any way with the making of this film, take a bath cause you stink!

The Fast and the Furious," The Dull and the Infuriating
","You know that you're in trouble when a character's speech about the tragic death of their father inspires guffaws of sincere laughter. Yes sir, this movie is pretty wack, for lack of a better word. Think Point Break with cars instead of surfboards and you get this mindless fungii of a movie. To be fair, there are positives. But to be fair to Point Break, Point Break is at least a hundred thousand times better than this sludge. The first street race in the movie is pretty intense. I've gotta say it. I saw this movie on DVD and I have a pretty decent setup, so when I popped this sucker in and watched it in DTS, I was blown away. There are several other interesting action scenes but nothing that comes close to the energy of the street race. Vin Diesel was the best thing about this movie next to the 'tricked out' rides. I'm not gonna rag him too much but dude, don't be a slave to the machine. Do movies that are a little riskier, like Pitch Black. Back to the review: This movie is so unintentionally funny that you'll be wiping tears off of your cheeks. Believe it. If you want proof of just how funny this movie is, check out the scene where... hell, check them all out. Paul Walker... who the hell is this guy? Maybe he's cool in real life but I couldn't stand him here. Michelle Rodriquez is a Latin pepper! Jordana Brewster is nice on the eyes. It's the dialogue that causes the pain here. This movie is also a treat for anyone who likes to see people survive the unthinkable. And who came up with that truck hijacking plan? They should be hanged in front of their relatives.

Resident Evil," This movie was watchable! Sorta.
","It just wasn't that good. It has slight similarities to the video game series but not enough to call it a truly faithful adaptation. Milla Jovovich gets a plus rating here, as well as Michelle Rodriguez, even though she plays the same role here as she did in 'Fast and the Furious'. You know, the tough, take-no-nonsense chick. Blah. I don't know, I think my beef with the flick is that it just could've been so much more in the right hands. I'm not a big Paul Anderson fan but I don't bash him either. He shows promise when he wants (i.e. Event Horizon, though the film itself is just as lackluster as Resident Evil) and I guess there was the possibility that he could've made this into a respectful fright fest. I think what happened is that his style got in the way, turning what should have been a gothic, creepy zombie flick into a metallic, overstylized piece of celluloid. I liked some of what he offered but it didn't outweigh what I had problems with. The laser beam sequence was actually pretty good. I feel that if this had been given to George Romero (as it should've been) to do, it would've been what it was supposed to. I don't know what happened there except for some problem with creative differences between him and the producers or something. Oh, well. I can't help but feel disappointed about the movie, having played through several of the Resident Evil videogames. It's watchable if you're looking for a no-brainer action flick with some cute chicks and interesting action sequences. What you see is what you get! RATING: ** out of *****.",Null,0,1,10 March 2003
Saving Private Ryan," Definitely one of the best war movies of our time
","I saw this on the big screen on opening day. While the show before mine was clearing out, I saw a guy I knew coming out, his face a mask of dried tears. He's not the kind of guy who cries for anything, so I figured that I was in for something I might not be able to handle. I went in and sat down, shivering with anticipation. The movie starts with an old man in a military cemetery breaking down at the sight of the hundreds of crosses marking the graves of his fallen comrades. I was already near tears by this point. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, the infamous twenty-five minutes of the Omaha Beach landing hit me with the force of a speeding plane crash. To put it mildly, I have seen enough violent movies in my time to say I've been pretty much desensitized to violence, even though the occasional violent, gory scene can still get me on occasion. While watching the beginning of this film, I remember thinking at one point, 'This has to stop. Please God, make it stop.'. The rest of the movie doesn't stray too far from the in-your-face style of the first minutes and when all is said and done, you walk away realizing that Spielberg, no matter what his detractors may say, is indeed a genius. I consider this movie to be the reason I wanted to get back into filmmaking after dropping out of film school. This movie makes its points and makes you question the validity of the senseless slaughter of so many innocent lives in the face of war, no matter what side of the fence you speak of. I never gave the WW2 vets a second thought until I saw this movie. Now I think of them and their hardships, especially around Memorial Day. The cinematography here ranks among the best I have ever seen. John Williams score is phenomenal and if you don't believe me, listen to the very last piece of music played over the end credits. It is an incredible piece that can only be described as beautifully patriotic. All of the performances in this film were spot on, though it did jar me a little to see Ted Danson pop up out of nowhere with a smoking machine gun in hand. I cannot recommend this movie enough, though I'd suggest that anyone unnerved by extremely realistic, and at times sadistic, violence should avoid this because it's pretty upsetting. I can only say that like my friend, I walked out of the theater a sobbing wreck. On my way out, I noticed that there were many vets in the audience. Many of them were crying on the shoulders of their wives, who were busy consoling them. Along with the film as a whole, it was a sight I am sure I will never forget.

28 Days Later...," Behold the return of the zombie movie!
","Simply put, if you enjoyed any of Romero's Dead movies, you'll at least like this. I love the fact that this flick was shot on DV. It gives the film that whole 'documentary' feel. There were moments in this movie where I was grabbing the armrests of my seat in anticipation. There were a lot of great songs in this. All of the suspenseful scenes are underscored with this faint violin music that sounds sort of like buzzing flies and it kept me on edge for awhile. The movie does have its bad points, some of the acting by the principals coming to mind. Some parts were a bit too slow for me also and I found myself kind of anxious for the goods to pop up again. I also thought the last 1/3 of the movie kind of fell apart. Bad stuff aside, I thought the entire idea of the people being infected by rage, instead of simply being the walking dead was a nice touch, providing for zombies that have a lot of energy to spare. There's even a nifty Stephen King tribute here (readers of the Stand will know which scene I mean) that sets up one of the movie's more terrifying moments! I like the characters, especially that machete wielding chick. One of the characters gets killed off early on after leading you to believe that he's gonna stick around for awhile. I love that stuff! I like my movies to have atmosphere and this one has it in spades. You will realize it for yourself when you see those shots of the main character walking through those huge, deserted London streets. Danny Boyle, you have inspired me to make my own DV film! Now, if I could only afford a Goddamned DV camera... Rating: ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,0,30 June 2003
Cars," Slow start but speeds ahead to come out on top!
","For the first half hour or so of the movie, all I could think to myself was, 'Damn, Pixar might be in trouble here.' For some reason, I just could not get into it at the beginning. The whole thing with having cars as characters just didn't sit well with me, the story wasn't engaging and I couldn't shake the feeling like Pixar had finally dropped the ball with this one. The streak had gone long enough and Pixar had struck out after a long line of animated classics.Thankfully, I was wrong because by the end of the movie, I was loving it. By the end, I loved all of the characters and I had that same fuzzy feeling that I got from all of the other Pixar films. The story was a bit formulaic but in there were definitely several moments where I found myself getting a little choked up. Yeah, I'll admit it. The story is actually very touching and what I really dug was that the main character, Lightning McQueen, really makes a change from the beginning of the film to the end of it and realistically speaking, that's what a good story always has, a big change. I hated him at first and by the end, he really proves himself to be a stand up guy (car, whatever...). The rest of the characters were great and fit their roles well, especially Paul Newman who is perfect for his role given his car racing history.I was laughing out loud at a lot of the jokes and on an interesting note, the jokes in this film are gonna fly right over the heads of probably 95% of the kids that go see this. I think this movie has more sight gags than any of the other Pixar films to date and sly jokes directed at the adult crowd.The animation surpasses everything else they've done up until now. If there is one word to describe it, it has to be photorealistic. Maybe too real.Last but not least, there is one absolutely hilarious bit at the end where John Ratzenberger's character, Mack, watches car versions of earlier Pixar movies with titles like 'Toy Car Story' and such. All he can do is comment on how funny the actor is who plays the roles that he did in those movies and... just watch it and see.In the end, while it's not the best Pixar movie, it's damn good and far from a failure. Car nuts will love it, adults will love it and I'm sure the kids are gonna eat this one up. Recommended.RATING: **** out of *****.",8,12,20,30 May 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Gollum says shine your light on the world, shine your light for the world to see
","I felt compelled to write when I read some of the responses that people had to the movie. Folks, let's get something out of the way first and foremost: the book is unfilmable in it's original layout. I'm sick of hearing all this complaining about how Peter Jackson and company changed this and changed that. I guess you would all like to see a hack like Michael Bay take a crack at it? Or maybe someone who didn't even read the book but was considered a perfect choice for his 'stylish' visuals? People, understand something. The movies are being made by someone who has an obvious affection for the books, possibly more so than any other film director working today. The guy is doing everything he can to give the books the treatment they deserve! Of course stuff is gonna get left out! Anybody who thinks he is making this movie solely to get it out there and get some money out of it, without any regard for a respectable adaptation is sorely mistaken. Come on, how much is he straying from the source material that you have to whine like kids? I personally think this movie was excellent on all counts. The only complaint I have is that it was a little slow at times and some of the ending dialogue was a little hokey but there's so much here that leaves you in awe that it'd make for a review well over the thousand word limit, so I'm gonna keep my praise restrained. Gandalf's battle with the Balrog was something that I've never seen anything like in a film before and that's saying something. Frodo falling into the Dead Marshes was one of the creepiest scenes I have ever seen in a movie, period. I don't think the Academy would have the balls to nominate Andy Serkis for best supporting actor but some kind of honorable mention is due. This is digital character done right, no mentioning the other digital atrocity bestowed upon us back in '99. I don't have to mention the name, do I? The battle of Helm's Deep was a technical accomplishment that, sad to say it, makes similar large scale effects works like Attack of the Clones look like grade school stuff. The movie was close enough to the books that I could honestly overlook any omissions or additions made. Everything that was added was true to Tolkien's work. Anything that was omitted was done for the best reasons, I'm sure. I'm dying to see how Jackson executes the scene left out of the Two Towers book at the very end, the one scene anyone who has read the book remembers. The acting was great on all sides and the music was almost as good as Fellowship of the Ring was. This movie was something else. Peter Jackson, I stand and I salute you and I applaud your effort, as well as the rest of the people who helped you to bring this to the screen in such magnificence. Count me among the first to buy this DVD and the extended cut on their respective release dates. And count me among the first in line for Return of the King.

The Incredibles," Dahling, dahling, dahling.... this movie is incredible
","I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times. In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, 'The Iron Giant', which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****.",10,314,400,7 November 2004
The Mist," Someone give Frank Darabont exclusive license, please
","Frank Darabont aims for the nosebleed seats and achieves it with resounding success. He has managed to take a Stephen King story that could have easily been nothing but a B-movie schlock film and translated it into a rich, engrossing film that is right up there with the best of the King adaptations.The acting in this film was superb on all counts. I've always liked Thomas Jane and I think he makes a great leading man. You'll see a couple of Darabont regulars here like Bill Sadler and Jeffrey DeMunn and they deliver as usual. Toby Jones isn't the Ollie Weeks that I pictured from the story but he's one of the best things about the film. Laurie Holden is great also and Frances Sternhagen excels in a role that seems tailor made for her. Marcia Gay Harden's turn as Mrs. Carmody is the kind of performance that is of Oscar quality. Most likely it won't happen but I'd love to see an acting nomination spring up come Oscar time.The special effects aren't so great but they're not so bad either. The movie is pretty gruesome at times and several people get shredded to bits quite nicely.What I love most about this film is that Darabont pretty much does the same thing he did with Shawshank: he takes the original source and expands upon it without ruining the integrity of the original story. There are small additions here and there with the ending fleshed out into a logical and more definitive denouement. None of what is added ruins the story in anyway, it enhances it. The man is an actor's director and again, I have to praise the acting in this film for keeping me rooted in the sense of dread and despair that weighs down on you from the very beginning and is so essential to the story.Go see this movie but be warned for it's a rough ride. It's really tense for pretty much the entire runtime and it's a very dark film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",9,0,7,23 November 2007

","I absolutely love this movie. I can watch this movie on a loop. Describing it would rob the first-time viewer of a great cinematic experience and would probably annoy those who've already seen it, so I won't bother.The acting in this movie is incredible. Naomi Watts righteously deserved an Oscar for her role here but hey, since when do the Academy members give awards to those who truly deserve it? Everyone else in the movie delivers, especially Justin Theroux and Laura Elena Harring. Same goes for David Lynch who quite simply, has made a film so incredible that he may not be able to top himself. Sad to say but I believe it to be true. Roger Ebert said it best when he said in regards to this film that 'the best movie of the year wasn't nominated for best picture'. I couldn't agree more. I have faith in Lynch to continue making great movies but this movie in particular treads the fine line between being accessible and inaccessible so well that I just think it'd be an impossible feat for him to redo. On a side note, I think that this film has the creepiest scene I have ever seen in a movie. That scene in the diner is an exercise in pure terror. I love the fact that this movie steers completely away from the formulaic chock that Hollywood seems so at ease with. Films like these show that there is still life in the creative process. I'll take a movie like this over 98% of what comes out of the system these days. If you happen or have happened to watch this movie and feel lost or confused by it, don't fret. There is plenty of material online to help you unlock the secrets of this wondrous puzzle box and every viewing of this movie only serves to intrigue you more and more.RATING: ***** out of *****.",10,1,3,4 January 2005
Grave of the Fireflies," Step right up and join the ranks of the most depressing movies ever made!
","A friend of mine asked me what I wanted for my birthday recently and I asked for a DVD copy of this movie. I had heard a lot about it and was curious to see it. I got around to watching it last night and went to sleep feeling absolutely miserable. This one ranks right up there with those other cartoons that I consider to be sadistic, i.e Charlotte's Web, Watership Down, The Velveteen Rabbit, the one with that Tin Soldier and his girlfriend getting shot to pieces, etc. I'm glad that I saw this movie now at 29 than if I had years ago because it might have caused me emotional damage. To put it bluntly, I strongly recommend that you don't watch this movie if you are anywhere near a good mood because your good mood will be a thing of history after watching this.The story revolves around a young boy and his younger sister, struggling to survive during WWII. They face the threat of air raids constantly. Food is scarce due to strict rationing. The children are hardly given a second look by the other people, including other family members, trying to piece their lives back together. The two children are a joy to watch together. The relationship is sweet and loving, with hardly any bickering between the two. It is perhaps this aspect of the film that made me feel so terrible at the end of the movie. The little sister is so cute that you just can't help but smile when her face lights up with happiness. The older brother tries to carry on, with the weight of their survival on his shoulders and it's heartbreaking to think that any child should be burdened with such a responsibility.I want to cut my review short here, as I don't want to give away too much. I think this film should be watched by all but I warn those of you who haven't seen it to prepare accordingly. I was in tears at the end of the movie but ultimately, I was glad to have finally seen it. Rating: ****1/2 out of *****.",Null,1,2,3 October 2003
Saw II," Please don't tell me any of you thought this was good!
","This movie was absolutely awful. For one, what the hell is up with movies nowadays that they need to have twenty to thirty cuts for every second of footage? Watching this movie reminds me of the time that I got electrocuted for a couple of seconds. I could barely concentrate watching this heap of poo. I blame MTV for this one.What I really hate about this film is that the villain is just TOO goddamn smart. I'm sorry but in order to plan anything even halfway to the level that Jigsaw did in this film would require an IQ of at least alien proportions, not to mention an ability to see into the future and predict a person's every move. I can appreciate that this is a movie and all but come on, this was just ridiculous. You had this guy making schemes so complicated that even Leonard Nimoy would've been left scratching his head had he read the script. This movie has nothing on the dozens of other movies it has ripped off and frankly, I'm going to die happy knowing I never have to watch it again.I will say that there are some good deaths but the movie is so bad that it just renders it all useless. Yeah there are some scenes that will freak people out but come on, this is far from good stuff. And before I forget, Franky G, (who plays Xavier the muscle bound retard whose role in the film seems to be to make Hispanics look bad... I'm Hispanic myself so I can say that) is absolutely horrendous in this. I found myself wanting to jam my thumbs in my eyes whenever he did so much as speak.A few things save this from being a COMPLETE waste of time: some good murders, a semi interesting ending and Donnie Wahlberg who always surprises me with how bad he can be when he wants to be.No more Saw movies, I beg you!RATING * and a 1/2 out of *****.",3,5,9,13 July 2006
Black Hawk Down," Lotsa lotsa action
","When I saw this movie in the theaters, I walked out thinking to myself that I had just paid to see a two hour action scene. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it somewhat. Upon first watching though, it's kind of hard to tell exactly what's going on. They don't really make too much of an attempt to humanize too many of the characters and when they're running around later getting shot at from every direction, you really won't be able to tell who's who. I think this movie is definitely worth seeing at least twice because in my case, the story didn't really hit me until I saw it the second time on DVD. What's amazing about the movie is that even if only half of what was portrayed was remotely true, it still shakes you up to think that these things go on in our world. One thing I found interesting was that the movie isn't necessarily a gung-ho pro-American movie. Yeah, it's patriotic but the film serves more to show how well-trained the soldiers trying to escape the city actually were. I found the movie to be really intense. I mean, you get about twenty-five minutes of set-up and then the rest of the movie is literally a huge battle with the citizens of the city. While the ratio of American kills to Somalian kills was pretty low (something like 19 Americans to over 1,000 Somalis), you still feel it when the Americans take casualties. The scenes with the helicopters going down and the aftermath are really grim and the thought of actually being in a conflict like that makes one feel a bit tense. The battle scenes are very violent and you will not be bored watching this movie. In fact, you may think it has too much action. I recommend the movie strongly, at the very least for the technical design and Ridley Scott's direction, which is always spot-on. RATING: **** out of *****.",Null,0,0,11 August 2003
The Mummy Returns," I never thought I would say this...
","... but this movie has almost TOO much action. The first one is just to set up the characters. This one says, 'Okay, you know who these people are and we're gonna just skip all the getting to know you stuff and get right to it.' Yes ladies and gents, this movie is one gigantic action sequence and it doesn't quit well after it should. There's actually a point halfway through the movie where it could've ended from how grand it gets. Pay attention to the final moment of the double decker bus chase, where the shot pulls back to show the bus careening across the bridge with Brendan Fraser on top of it. Listen to the score at that point because I swore to God at that point that I couldn't handle anymore excitement. But it kept coming. And coming. Until I started to get annoyed. See, I actually like this movie but the fact that the story is kinda half-assed and theres an overdose of action kinda takes away from it. And another big negative is some of the CGI (which I wont be specific about; I like to keep my reviews spoiler free) looks REALLY fake. I recommend this movie but dont expect a 'great' movie. It's a perfect example of what you see is what you get. And it never gets boring. Rating: *** out of *****.

Reservoir Dogs," Hell of a debut film
","I revisited this film a couple of days ago and a couple of things struck me about it. This is one hell of a film to have as a calling card. For one, the cast that this movie has is enough to inspire serious jealousy. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Laurence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Chris Penn... hot damn! You really see just why everyone wanted to make a film just like this one after it was released. It's funny but the film is so derivative of other crime films that it becomes an entirely new animal. Tarantino delivers a film that is completely sure of itself and what it wants to be. Yeah, some people complain that it's a ripoff of other films that preceded it, namely Ringo Lam's 'City on Fire' but still, the film has so many memorable moments and gobs of instantly quotable dialogue that it is undoubtedly a classic of independent cinema. Tarantino's acting in this film is thankfully subdued. Violence comes in sudden jolts and reminds you of what kind of people it is you are dealing with within the film. The music selection is inspired and he does a great job of establishing these characters through their words and actions, which is why this film is so great. You have to love the characters, even in the case of Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) who gets much less screen time than anyone else in the film.I would like to at least give a nod of special attention to all of the actors in this film. Every single one is a crucial piece to this puzzle and are all very believable in their roles. If I had to pick one scene that was my favorite, it'd be very difficult. Whether it's an outburst of sudden violence or a conversation across a coffee table, this film delivers in almost all aspects.There really isn't much more that I can say about the film that hasn't already been said. The film is a bit rough around the edges technically speaking but hey, it was the guy's first film and it was filmed on a pretty shoestring budget. Regardless, this is simply the kind of film that one wishes they'd have as a debut film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",9,3,6,9 August 2005
The Descent," I think I'll scratch caves off of my list of places to explore now, thanks girls
","As a horror fan, this movie gets me excited because it seems like we're finally heading in the right direction again with horror films. I found this movie to be very creepy and I definitely enjoyed this one quite a bit. I'll tell you one thing, before this movie even introduces the monsters, it shows you just how terrifying and dangerous cave exploring can be and it does it effectively enough that I swore I would never lower myself into some unknown darkness via rope.The story involves a young woman who loses her husband and daughter in a horrific car accident and after taking some time to get her head together, decides to go cave exploring with her girlfriends (I have to add here that I've never met women who are this adventurous in real life... to have six of them together in a film like this gives me hope). Things go wrong as you can already imagine and you end up with a movie that in lesser hands, could have been a total piece but ends up being a genuinely scary movie. It's not the scariest movie in the world but it's better than a lot of what's been coming out as of late.I thought the actresses (I fell in love with Ms. Mendoza who plays Juno..... I love you!) were really good and I loved the way that they were able to use the most subtle expressions to communicate. Looks are traded and you can basically fill in the blanks. I thought they interacted very well with each other and unlike other horror films, I didn't want them to get butchered as I began to sympathize with them. But guess what? You can't have a horror movie without people getting decimated and decimated they get. I wouldn't recommend this movie to the squeamish and people who are claustrophobic because while I'm not claustrophobic myself, there were several moments where I began to feel short of breath.I loved the story and the tragedy that enfolds it. The way things turn out are understandable in a way but still makes you say, that's just not right. I won't ruin it for you but if you see it, you'll see what I mean. The gore effects are pretty good and I thought the monsters were okay as well. In all honesty, I enjoyed the movie's first half a little better than the monster fest of the latter half because the scares were rooted in reality. There was a moment where one of the girls gets stuck in a tunnel that was just cringe inducing.I'll end the review by recommending this film highly. One of the better horror films I've seen in a while.RATING: **** out of *****.",8,3,7,10 August 2006
Inside Man," 4 is the magic number
","When you put Denzel Washington together with Spike Lee, the sparks are pretty much guaranteed to fly. Even with their weakest collaboration, 'He Got Game', Denzel still gives one of his best performances ever. With 'Inside Man', their fourth collaboration together, you get the satisfaction of both Denzel's solid acting and a genuinely exciting, well told and well acted thriller.I'm hesitant to discuss the plot but I can definitely say that this movie had my attention all the way through. I, like many others, am pleasantly surprised at Lee's handling of the material, which is a change from his usual fare. With this film and the 25th Hour under his belt, I guess it can be said that Lee can indeed direct a mainstream film.Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer were all excellent. The film's pace never lets up and maybe I'm just misinformed or didn't notice any logistical inaccuracies but I thought that the bank robbery itself was ingenious. The last few minutes of the movie are pretty cool also. When everything becomes clear in the end, you probably won't see it coming and that's probably the biggest reason for me liking this film.The story is very surprising and very entertaining. It reminded me of those gritty cop drams from the 70's. I strongly recommend this film to all of those looking for an exciting little flick with a good story and great acting.RATING: **** out of *****.",8,2,3,16 August 2006
The Untouchables," And that's the Chicago Way!

Swing batta batta swing! 4) The classic shootout in the train station. 5) Some really sad music by Ennio Morricone. The sax-based 'Death Theme' in this movie stands out as one of the most moving pieces of film score I have ever heard. 6) Lots of blood. 7) De Palma making a film that doesn't make him look like a hack. 8) Great supporting performances by Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Billy Drago, among others. 9) Instant quotable dialogue courtesy of David '@#$%^&' Mamet. 10) A satisfied feeling when it's over.This movie has a special spot on my all-time faves.

The Matrix Reloaded," I like my code green with no sugar
","WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW:There are a lot of things to like and dislike in this movie. A positive for every negative. Does this mean the movie is only so-so? Not really. I've been putting off writing a review for this movie for awhile now because since it's really half of one big movie (Revolutions being the other half), I felt like I needed to give this movie some time to sink in while balancing it with the worth of Revolutions. For some reason, I'm having difficulty deciding what to write about, so I'm just going to wing it a little bit. I'll break it down into three categories, starting with:THINGS THAT REALLY SUCKED ABOUT THIS MOVIE: - Gloria Foster. The only time that this movie really captures the magic that the first one had was when she finally appeared and due to her untimely death, we get very little of her. A negative that isn't anyone's fault but still takes away from the movie. - The Twins. Victims of the movie's prerelease hype. Who wasn't left disappointed with the treatment of what potentially could've been amazing characters in the trilogy? - Way too much 'intellectual' babble. - A ridiculous rave/tribal dance scene. - Some seriously wooden acting. There are moments where I wanted to pull my hair out from how bad it was. I'll spare you the naming of names. - The whole Matrix thing losing its novelty to some extent because of this movie. - Product placement, but that sucks in almost every movie. - That overall sense of imbalance you get from watching a sequel that just doesn't live up to the original. Definitely frustrating when watching it for the first time.THINGS THAT KINDA SUCKED BUT WERE ALSO KIND OF COOL: - The disappearance of Tank from the first Matrix but then again, his character was at least acknowledged. - Monica Bellucci or the lack of. This woman is unbelievably hot and it really is a shame that there wasn't more of her to be seen, at least in my selfish opinion. - The cliffhanger ending. It could've been done better but it somehow manages to whet your appetite for the next chapter. - Neo and Trinity. I didn't feel their connection in this one like I did in the first. In the first, I believed that these two could possibly love each other. I felt in this one that these were two people acting like they were desperately in love. But at least we do get more Neo and Trinity. -The special effects. Don't get me wrong, they are way above average but there are moments where it is just too obvious that you are watching CG, especially during the highway chase. - Morpheus/ Laurence Fishburne. I would've liked for his character to have more of a presence in this film but somehow I felt he was underused. - The score. I would've liked for the music in the film to be more orchestral like the first and less like something from a video game. Not that I dislike video games but you get what I mean. There are some good pieces in here ('Mona Lisa Overdrive' and 'When the World Ends' by Dave Matthews are excellent) but the Burly Brawl music kinda bites in that manufactured, trying-to-get-your-adrenaline-pumping way.THINGS THAT WERE REALLY COOL ABOUT THIS MOVIE: - The car chase on the highway. Not the best ever (I'd say that the realism of the Road Warrior tops this) but still damn exciting. - The Burly Brawl. While a little fake looking on more than a few occasions, this is still a great scene, even if you think Neo should've just flown away from all those Smiths. - The Architect's speech. While at first I thought that this was the most ridiculous moment in the film, it became apparent to me after watching the film a second time that what he was saying was pretty intense. One of the reasons to watch this movie more than once. - The Keymaker/ Randall Duk Kim. Another character that elevated the story just by his mere presence. - Neo/ Keanu Reeves. Though there is some flat acting on the part of Keanu, I have to say that the man deserves a lot of respect for his work here. None of the martial arts stunts he performed in the movie were easy to pull off, I'm sure. You have to give the guy kudos for the sheer amount of physical training he did for the film and while the fight choreography shows under the seams occasionally, watch the scene where Neo fights the Merovingian's henchmen. There are a lot of subtle little moves and counter moves that he pulls off that left me very surprised and impressed with his abilities. - Smith/ Hugo Weaving. Arguably the BEST thing about this movie and worth the price of admission alone. - The Merovingian/ Lambert Wilson. Awesome character. This is one guy I would like to know more about in terms of his previous history in the other incarnations of the Matrix.CONCLUSION: In the end, you are left with a movie that is visually exciting, even if it really is a candy coating on an empty shell. Those looking for a movie that is just as good as the original will be left perplexed and rightfully disappointed. But how many sequels are better than the first? Alternately, I think the movie works better once you've gotten the initial disappointment out of your system after watching it a couple of times. Take this and Revolutions for what they are and you'll enjoy them for the most part. There is a lot more I can say about the movie but I think I covered the main details enough to give a decent overall view on the film and what to expect. Now, I'm off to start writing my review of Revolutions.Rating: *** out of *****.",Null,0,1,30 October 2004
The Departed," Scorsese is back, dammit!
","It's true. All the reviews talk about this film being his best since 'Goodfellas'. Every single one is right. I'd like to keep the review pretty short and to the point, so I'll say this much: <ul><li>All of the actors were great in their roles. The three principals plus the supporting players, Baldwin, Farmiga, O'Hara, Sheen, Wahlberg, among others) were a joy to watch. Gotta love those Boston accents! </li></ul><ul><li>This movie is two and a half hours and not once did it drag. That's saying something.</li></ul><ul><li>Things I didn't like? Maybe the only thing was that I think at some points, the acting wasn't as subtle as it should've been at times. It seemed to me that every time the word 'rat' was said around Costigan or Sullivan, they looked like they were trying not to crap in their pants. Plus, Jack Nicholson came a little close to overdoing it but he was still a sight to see. Just a minor beef and nothing that came close to ruining the movie for me.</li></ul><ul><li>Does it live up to the original? I think it does. I rewatched 'Infernal Affairs' last night as well and I have to say that the original is probably a little bit tighter in spots but they're both great representations of what is essentially the same story.</li></ul>Scorsese has returned to do what he does best. This is a damn good film and I'm recommending it whole heartedly. At this point, the man doesn't need an Oscar. We all know that he's one of the best out there, if not the best, and I don't think a crummy Oscar is going to matter. I just hope he continues to make films of this caliber from here on out.I don't think I'd be exaggerating by giving this movie five stars. It was absolutely fantastic and the most enjoyable, entertaining film I've seen this year.RATING: ***** out of *****.",10,1,3,7 October 2006
Die Hard," 'You shoulda heard your brother squeal... when I broke his f*****g neck!'
","This may sound stupid to those of you that think that the only movies that should be considered quality works are period pieces and Merchant Ivory productions but I honestly think that this is one of the greatest and influential movies ever made. Hang him high, you're probably saying. I say, hear me out.I saw this in the theaters when it came out back in 1988, which would have put me at fourteen at the time. I remember clearly, thinking nothing about this movie going into it. It had Bruce Willis, who really didn't strike me as the action hero type, being familiar with him only from the TV show, 'Moonlighting'. The trailer for the film said nothing more than, 'GET READY TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE BACK OF THE THEATER!' or something along those lines, coupled with lots of rapid fire editing and explosions and gunfire and no real hint at what the story would be about. It didn't occur to me that I would be walking out of the theater feeling like I had an idea of what to do with my life.I credit this movie with giving me the desire to make my own films. I've always loved movies and have always appreciated their artistic and production values but for some reason, this was the one that had me saying afterwards, 'Wow, I would love to give people the same feeling that this movie gave me'. This was the one that really hit home.Bruce Willis creates one of the most enduring screen heroes of all time with hard edged cop John McClane. Think about it, when you hear the name, don't you just know that trouble's right around the corner? He was the perfect antidote to the ridiculous peak of the action films of the 80's, where you had Schwarzenegger traveling to remote islands and wiping out entire platoons of soldiers single handedly in 'Commando' or Stallone massacring entire nations of troops in the Rambo movies. Come to think of it, I'm surprised that Stallone didn't tie one arm behind his back to even things up a little. But I digress. In John McClane, we have a hero that is a little closer to the regular joes who walk the streets, someone who knows that he isn't bulletproof. In his fear, we see ourselves and I love that about the character. Yeah, his smartass jokes might get on your nerves once in a while but it only serves to make the character that much more endearing.Then you have Alan Rickman. I can only think of one other movie villain who I'd consider about as good as he is here and that's Gary Oldman in 'Leon' (or 'The Professional', for those that aren't familiar with the film's original title). Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber is the best thing since canned Vienna Sausages in this film. In fact, I'll just leave it at that. If you haven't seen this movie, do so and see why I say that. If you have already, I know you've agreed with me already.Now, the action sequences are something else entirely. John McTiernan directs with expertise and all the action scenes are pulse-pounding, to say the least. The scene where McClane jumps off the roof of the building with a fire hose tied around his waist goes down (for me anyway) as a moment I'd put up with Moses parting the Red Sea in the Ten Commandments. One thing I remember clearly about this scene was how insane the audience I was with got during that moment. Classic.There are a lot of other things I can say about this movie but I really feel like it's better left for those of you who haven't seen it to experience for yourselves. I really, really believe that this is probably THE greatest action movie ever made. A human story, great action, great villains, great supporting players, great special effects... you can't ask for more. RATING: ***** out of *****.",10,1,2,5 January 2005
War of the Worlds," Bring on the death rays!
","Go see this movie. Simply put, the first hour is absolutely brilliant. While the last hour of the movie doesn't equal the bar that Spielberg sets at the beginning, it was still one hell of a ride.The characters are setup perfectly in the first few minutes. Cruise is as good as he's ever been (and hey, I didn't even think about Katie Holmes once while watching it!), Fanning is pitch perfect and Chatwin was very good also. I'll spare you plot description because I think the ads have made the point pretty clear.Then all hell breaks loose. I've gotta say it but the destruction you see in the beginning of the movie was just phenomenal. The special effects are as real as they've ever been in any movie before this. When the aliens start laying waste to everything with those heat rays.... fuggedaboutit! When people get shot with those things, they explode into dust and it provides some horrific imagery. What I loved about the movie was that it really felt authentic. When you see how people react and what is happening in various places and the predicaments that Cruise and kids run into, it serves to make you feel like this is how it would be, were this to really happen. The scene where the family is attacked for their vehicle was chilling and horrifying to me, simply because I knew that it wasn't a stretch for humans to act in this manner. There is an obvious subtext with the whole post 9/11 world we are living in and it never gets heavy handed nor exploitative, which made me respect the movie even more. It's a B-movie in a sense but it has more on it's mind than just wanting to scare you senseless.Then you have the scene of Ray's (Tom Cruise's character) neighborhood getting destroyed. That scene with the bridge makes you forget the commercials. That was some serious destruction going on there.I think I might have been holding my breath through the introduction of the alien tripods. The sound design in this film is one for the home theater crowd. This movie is LOUD. The sound that the tripods make... think the exact opposite of Close Encounters. No catchy melodies but something more like the sound of an 18-wheeler's horn. I CANNOT WAIT for the DVD to be released, that's for sure. My neighbors are going to want to kill me.Look, Spielberg did not drop the ball with this film. I know that's what you're all wondering, right? The only problems I had with the film is that the ending is a bit too feel good for me and the whole sequence with Tim Robbins slows the movie to a crawl. From there on, the movie just doesn't match the intensity of all that has come before this point. There are still some good scenes but nothing that will make you sink back into your seat with wide eyes and mouth hanging open. This film is scary, awesome and most of all, very well told and directed. The sparse music by John Williams is fine as always. Wow, the special effects.... listen, if you've gotta see this movie for one thing, watch it for the first hour and go see it in a theater with a huge screen and a kick-ass sound system. Fantastic! If you're looking for a typical Independence Day movie with a slam bang finale, I suggest you look elsewhere. This is one for the people who like to be treated as intelligent adults when told a tale. Good work and thumbs up to everyone involved with this film! RATING: ****1/2 out of *****",9,1,8,29 June 2005
Man on Fire," Thanks for the information but I'm gonna kill you anyway!
","That's pretty much what this movie is about. Denzel Washington plays Creasy, an ex-assassin hired to protect the cute little daughter of a wealthy industrialist couple in Mexico City. The daughter gets abducted by some career kidnappers which makes Denzel extremely livid. He goes out with the intention of destroying everybody responsible and/or involved with the kidnapping, which provides for a good opportunity to see people buy the farm in horrible ways. My choice of the word destroy is not an exaggeration. With one guy in particular, he stuffs a wad of plastic explosive up the dude's butt and well.... you put the rest together. The movie in itself is entertaining but kind of thin. I mean, it's a very simple plot. Yeah there's a twist or two but the movie is basically what I mentioned earlier: a kidnapping and then a tour of revenge. There are some good lines here, my favorite being the one where Denzel says something along the lines of forgiveness being a matter to be discussed between the guilty person and God and he's just there to arrange the meeting. Couple that with the fact that he's holding a rocket launcher while he's saying it and it's pretty funny and frightening at the same time. I thought the dynamic between Creasy and the little girl Pita (Dakota Fanning) was genuinely touching. Though I knew that she was going to be kidnapped, it only made their early scenes together more emotional. One thing that left me feeling a bit annoyed with the film was the direction. I love Tony Scott but I think he can get a bit ham-fisted with the visuals. The combination of shaky camera work, Ginsu knife editing and bleached out color nearly made me go back to the credits to make sure that the movie wasn't directed by Michael Bay. At points, the camera moved so much that I was wondering if they were administering shock treatments to the camera operator while he was working. Even something like the pouring of a drink is filmed to be an all out assault on the senses. The use of subtitles are executed in such a way that they call just a little too much attention to them. While it's an interesting aesthetic choice, I don't need to see subtitles flying in from the right side of the screen and then have half of the words fade out and the rest of the letters explode outwards... Christ, just keep it simple! Anyway, to end the review, I'll say that I enjoyed the movie but it could've used a little less style and a bit more substance. Denzel makes this movie more than watchable and while it's not the most violent movie I've ever seen, it's always fun to watch people get creamed, especially when they deserve it.RATING ***1/2 out of *****.",7,0,0,14 March 2005
Con Air," Really, really stupid but somehow...
","I don't know. I saw this in the theater, I hated it then. I saw it on cable, I hated it then also. On the way to a ski lodge, it was playing on the bus ride. I hated it then also. Yet, this garbage is strangely watchable. It's very easy to suspend your disbelief while watching it for some reason. A bunch of convicts take over the plane they're being taken to some prison in and all sorts of mayhem ensues. Maybe it's because it doesn't take itself too seriously and all the actors involved seem to be enjoying themselves, that it doesn't fail completely. It has enough action for at like fifteen movies and there's a point in the movie that it just doesn't let up for like a straight hour. It's got a pretty good cast and never gets boring. I think Nicolas Cage was wrong for the role. I'm surprised to see he even did this. I don't picture him as a buff action hero but he manages to be as convincing as you can be, given the character he plays. You have all sorts of villains with colorful names like Cyrus the Virus, Billy Bedlam and Sally Cant Dance (I'm not a homophobe but that character just gives me the willies). This is one of those movies that definitely contributes to the decline of cinema quality as a whole. For every Memento, you're gonna get three of these kinds of movies. It's loud, it's dumb and it's violent enough to make you want to seek counseling for having sat through it. But on a rainy day, this movie'll do. Besides, you can probably do a lot worse.

Jaws," Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies...
","A perfect film. I doubt that anyone reading this hasn't seen it but if you haven't, I'll keep the recommendation simple. For one, I still have problems with going into deep water at the beach because of this movie. Second, Robert Shaw delivers what can be called the greatest monologue of all time (which reportedly he delivered in a drunken state). Third, the score by John Williams. Fourth, there's just no reason to keep going. The only flaw that I can think of is that the shark looks kinda fake in one or two scenes but you know what? I'll take Bruce (the shark's nickname, named after Spielberg's lawyer) over anything that would be produced these days, i.e. a badly fitting, CGI monstrosity. The movie has aged more than well and deserves a place on everyone's top films of all time. I would love to continue telling you why I love this film but I don't think I need to.

The Silence of the Lambs," 'Oh Agent Starling, you think you could dissect me with this blunt little tool?'
","This is one of those movies that force you to see exactly how ugly and how evil the world can be. While by no means the worst display of human cruelty I've ever seen, this one just grabs you in a way that few other films have. There are scenes in this that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, eyes unblinking. If you can only see one movie where Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter, please look no further. This is where you see just how frightening Lecter actually is. He's not a joke like he was in the sequel, nor is he an uninspired rehash like in Red Dragon, which is funny when you think of Red Dragon as a prequel. I read a review of the film somewhere that stated how unsettling Lecter is in his stillness, almost as if he is an animal ready to attack. I couldn't have said it better. It is a nod to the fact that you may one day be sitting across from someone who may look normal on the outside and yet be a monster on the inside. There's just too much good stuff I have to say about this movie that I'm actually beginning to feel overwhelmed by it all. There are so many small nuances that you just can't catch them all in one viewing. It's in the little things like the expressions and such. I'll say this much, it is easily one of the best films I have ever seen, period. It deserved to sweep the Oscars that year. Even Hannibal (the film) couldn't ruin the memory of this film for me. Watch this, especially if you don't know too much about the story line. Rating: ***** out of *****.",Null,0,0,25 April 2003
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig's here and brought the can of whoop ass
","All I can think of is how ridiculous that whole 'Ban Daniel Craig as Bond' craze was from a few months back. Bunch of fools, you'd think people would at least give the guy a chance but you know what? Craig doesn't need the support of those parasitic mongrels because he not only does justice to the Bond character, he has officially become (well, at least to me) the second best 007 after Connery.The only real complaint I have about the film was that it was a bit too long. It was about two and a half hours but with all the endings, it felt like three. Never mind all that as this Bond is dark, brutal and everything else you've been hearing. The action scenes are awesome, especially the chase at the beginning where he chases a guy who's more like a cross between a flying squirrel and a rubber band. The fights in this movie are like watching bar fights. Even the card games were intense. There's a nice little torture scene that will make you wince, especially if you're a guy. Hell, even the girls in the audience were squirming.They really went for realism this time out and it was without a doubt, the right move. Gone are the ridiculous gadgets and the one liners. This is a film about a ruthless government killer and is probably the closest to what Ian Fleming intended with the character. The villain is memorable and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd was a knockout.If this is the way that Bond is gonna be from here on out, then count me in for the ride. Daniel Craig, my hat off to you. You did a hell of a job and proved the petitioners wrong.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****.",9,0,1,25 November 2006
Bull Durham," 'You just spit on me! You spit on me!'
","ALERT: POSSIBLE SPOILER OR TWO This movie is one of two reasons why I can forgive Kevin Costner for every crap movie he has put out since the release of this film. The other reason is the Untouchables but that's a whole different review. Not that everything he came out with after Bull Durham was crap but I think we can agree that the man has made some floaters since then.Anyway, to put it bluntly, I think that Bull Durham is probably the best baseball movie I have ever seen thus far. I say thus far because at the time of this writing, I haven't seen Field of Dreams (I know... shoot me. I promise I'll write a review for that one as soon as I see it.) which seems to be a popular choice as well, so until I see that one, this is it for me. Kevin Costner's Crash Davis is a great character, the kind of character that can make a star out of someone overnight if played correctly. Susan Sarandon as Annie was undeniably sexy and Tim Robbins as Nuke LaLoosh was enjoyably dim. The interaction of these three characters with one another provides for some hilarious one liners and moments that anyone can appreciate. This is a baseball movie that isn't only about baseball and I think that's what makes this film so good. Not only is it about baseball but it's also about love. It's about letting go and moving on to something new. It's about accepting your place in the world and making the most of it. The movie plays out very genuinely and while it's a comedy for the most part, it becomes something completely different near the end of the movie, when Crash is cut from the team after fulfilling his duty of mentoring Nuke. That moment of the movie is so heartbreaking that it really lifts the movie to a whole other level. That scene speaks volumes and yet, there's very little dialogue. Costner also delivers a monologue early on in the film regarding his character's beliefs that is probably one of the best monologues ever. The movie has a lot to say and is actually a lot deeper than it looks like on the surface. Every time I watch the movie again, I seem to pick up on something new I never noticed before and I love when a movie doesn't reveal everything so readily. There's a lot more I can say about this movie but I'll just end it by saying that it is very well-written and directed, the acting is great, it's both hilarious and touching at the same time and most importantly, you don't necessarily need to be a baseball nut to enjoy it.

Signs," Signs Fiction
","A little history first. Saw the 6th Sense in the theaters and was absolutely knocked flat. With bated breath, I wait for Unbreakable and like so many others, came out of there disappointed. Signs is released and I miss it in the theaters, dismissing M. Night Shyamalan as a one-trick pony, even though the movie itself makes serious moolah. I ask around and received some generally positive reviews, with the ending polarizing just about everyone. The dvd is released and I pick it up, watching it about a week and a half later. I absolutely loved this movie. First off, Shyamalan is an actor's director. There is not one bad performance in this film and it's apparent early on that the actors themselves are being guided by a sure hand. I was especially impressed by the performances by the children. That little girl is absolutely adorable and gets my pick for cutest movie kid yet! Second, the mood of this film is eerie as all hell. The sound in this movie is awesome. All the major scenes in this movie use sound as its main force, creating a tense environment. I have a 5.1 surround setup at home and the cornfield scenes had me shivering with anticipation! Scenes in the house were well done in the sound department as well. The cinematography is great and it definitely has that look that his other two films share. Another thing that adds to the overall effect is the great score music by James Newton Howard. I kept commenting to myself while watching the movie about how great the music was. Great stuff! My personal favorite scene in this flick was the newscast of the birthday party video. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it but it was one of the moments where my jaw hit the floor. Now for my last comment and it's gonna be a spoiler-free riff on the ending so read on with no fear: Some people complained about the ending and personally it didn't bother me too much. I can see why people would feel it was a bit anti-climactic and in some ways, yes, it was. However, I think it was just right. After watching the movie, keep in mind what it was about. Was it really about the spooky, frightening realities within or was it about the life and inner workings of this family and what they meant to one another? I think this film was a great twist on what would normally be expected to have lots of action and destruction ala Independence Day. It's almost the opposite.

Beowulf," 3D the way it was meant to be!
","Look, if you want to see a film that will literally put you into a world of dragons and fantasy, look no further. Watching this movie in IMAX 3D will go down as one of the most memorable movie-going experiences of my life (at least up until now anyway).The acting is great, the CGI is absolutely unreal and more lifelike than Zemeckis's Polar Express which suffered from Dead Eyes Syndrome in its characters. The 3D puts you in the action like no other film up until now. All of the main action scenes are fantastic, especially Beowulf's battle against a dragon. The movie is pretty funny (even a bit silly at points) and very enjoyable. Some parts were a little weak but nothing so bad that it detracts from the whole. Alan Silvestri's score is top notch with a great main theme.Oh and Angelina Jolie is rendered to look absolutely stunning in this film. The last shot of her in the film is an image burned into my eyes.The film itself is a solid 3 1/2 but the experience makes it a solid 4 out of 5.RATING: **** out of *****",8,4,14,16 November 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The emptiness you are feeling is shared by me also.
","I just finished coming home from watching the entire trilogy and I'm more than satisfied with how it all ends. After watching the first two extended editions followed by this, I have to say that I am overwhelmed. Peter Jackson can sit back and relax. He has done it, what many filmgoers have called an impossible feat. This movie has it all and then some. It is absolutely never boring. There is action enough for three movies, I kid you not! I am having a tough time writing this review because there is just so much that I want to say but I don't think I can get it all down now. My mind is numbed by the thought that I have just witnessed the finale to the greatest film trilogy I have ever seen to this date. There is no more Lord of the Rings after this and it is a sad thing, a feeling that is kind of clenching my gut up into a knot right now. While I still have the extended version of ROTK to look forward to, I will be forced to accept the fact that this is it, this is all that is left to show. But they ended it with a bang. The movie does not disappoint and fits snugly into the trilogy with hardly any elbowing. You will be glad that you took the journey with these characters, especially when seeing the three films back to back. You may be reading this review and thinking to yourself that it's hardly that because I haven't really discussed the movie in what I've written. I can safely say that whatever scenes that you already know about and are looking forward to seeing will not let you down. The Shelob scene is pretty intense and looking back in retrospect, it isn't a stretch to say that it may be one of the best scenes in the overall trilogy. Wait until you see it. There is another scene in this which was simply astounding where Pippin lights a signal beacon to call for Rohan's aid. Sounds simple but in reality it is quite powerful, to say the least. I'm going to stop writing this review here. You should be running to the theaters to see this already and if you aren't, take it from me that you should. Try not to feel sad when it's over. We have been blessed. RATING: ***** out of *****.",Null,0,0,17 December 2003
A Nightmare on Elm Street," I wanna be.... your sledgehammer!
","This film is easily on my top three scariest films of all time. Sure, Freddy kinda got overexposed, what with Halloween costumes, toys, fifteen exceedingly bad sequels with another one on the way, talk show appearances, his own t.v. show, his own lingerie line, cookbook, website, board games, video games, condoms, etc., etc. available to the public. It's too bad because what made the first Elm Street work was the fact that you barely saw the guy at all. There isn't one scene in the movie where you get a real good look at this guy and to me, that's what makes the film scary even to this day. Even though the film contains many of the things that buried the slasher genre (the person investigating the strange noises for example), the movie still contains one of the more original stories seen in the horror genre. It's been imitated who knows how many times and while a little dated by the all too familiar '80s wardrobe, it's still pretty timeless. I don't know what's up with some of the music in this, it sounds like it was done with a really bad synthesizer. Heather Lagenkamp gives a great performance as the heroine and is the precursor for most of the slasher movie heroines that take a stand. Watch as she sets up a booby trap for Freddy with a door tripped sledgehammer to the chest! Watch for Johnny Depp in an early role. Definitely worth seeing or owning. Wes Craven at his best folks. Or would he be his best with Scream? Rating: **** out of *****.",Null,0,0,30 August 2002
The Matrix," 'Mr. Anderson...'
","You know you've found a special movie when you enjoy it more and more every time you watch it. The Matrix requires multiple viewings. Not to say that it isn't an amazing experience the first time around. It's just that watching it only once robs you of the complete experience. There is so much to this movie that it goes well beyond what any single user comment can provide. The special effects are incredible, the acting is satisfactory on all counts, there are some incredible action sequences (my personal favorite being the helicopter scene) and the story is great, while not entirely original. That's not an insult because these days you really can't make a movie without being influenced by one or several others. This movie was painted with shades of the Terminator, Ghost in the Shell, Hard Boiled and several others and it shows. This movie definitely deserves a place as one of the modern classics of cinema. It's one of the few films that actually succeeds in creating a living, breathing world. It's not too hard to imagine what else can be going on in the world of the Matrix other than what you see. There are so many options, so many exciting possibilities that the anticipation of waiting for the next two sequels makes you want to drag claw marks into the face of the person sitting next to you. At the time of this writing, I am patiently awaiting the sequels, hoping against the history of bad sequels to great movies that Hollywood can't seem to shake without a few exceptions. It's a big bar they've raised for themselves and you've gotta ask if the magic they've captured with the first one is still present enough to last through a trilogy. Let's hope so.

Sin City," Sin and Circumstance
","Sin City is an interesting, hyper stylized little film that I can recommend, along with the cautionary heads up notice of the existence of a couple of problems. That's the simplest thing I can say about the movie. There are some great performances in terms of the nailing of characters from the source down perfectly but at the same time, there was one thing about the whole package that bugged me and I realized what it was just before the halfway mark of the movie. The movie is very faithful to the original Frank Miller graphic novels, with most of the film draped in shadows and dialogue that sounds like it was written by Chandler's ghost and while it is admittedly cool as all hell to actually see a project like this on the screen (projected digitally no less...), I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe, just maybe, the film was being a little TOO faithful to the novels. I felt that the movie didn't flow quite as well as it should have, mainly because it seemed to me the filmmakers were a little too obsessed with recreating every frame down to the last detail, so much so that it felt too obvious and aware of itself in a lot of the scenes. I felt like many of the performances were hampered by the restrictions on them placed by having to stick so closely to the graphic novels. Some of the dialogue scenes seemed to go on forever also, dragging the film in between moments of breathless violence, which were pretty intense. Don't get me wrong, it was still really fun to watch some of these pros in action, especially Benicio Del Toro, Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Elijah Wood who turns in a fantastically creepy turn as a silent cannibal in possession of some serious fighting skills. His character along with Yellow Bastard (Nick Stahl, reminding us that the kid can play a really hateful character as well as the savior of the free world from the machines) gives the film a good amount of energy that good villains can bring to a story. Mickey Rourke gets a special mention from me for his work as Marv and proves as many others have done in the past before him that the world loves a great comeback as much as it loves to watch people get torn down. He's probably the best reason I can give you to watch this film, as he is arguably the heart and soul of it. The best performances come from those you normally expect to deliver, really. Some of the other performances kind of reeked with Michael Madsen coming to mind and Rutger Hauer doing more overacting than usual. Devon Aoki was awesome as Miho and Carla Gugino is going to be remembered fondly after this one, believe me. Jessica Alba didn't impress me too much character wise but damn, she's something to see, moving the way she does. The women are photographed with a lot of love and it's in this way that the movie really works hand and hand with the rest of the visuals. Some of the CGI is a little too obvious for my tastes but the look is perfect for this sort of thing in a way. Technically, the film is awesome but maybe it's just my appreciation for practical effects that makes me wish that there was less computer gimmickery. I can't help but wonder what this film would've been like if it had been shot on location rather than in front of a green screen. It's a cool effect that draws too much attention to itself after a while. In the end though, Robert Rodriguez made up for the all star vomit fest that was Once Upon a Time in Mexico with this. I have to give him credit for attempting something like this and I'd really like to see another Sin City movie done in the same way. Lastly, I also loved the music in the film. Sin City is a well produced gimmick film that regrettably starts to wear a little thin. I started getting a little tired of the whole idea soon after it started but these are dismissible gripes considering that there were still so many things to enjoy about it then there were to dislike. This is definitely one to see in the theaters, especially if you want to see a different kind of comic book movie and something pretty original.RATING: ***1/2 out of *****.",7,0,4,3 April 2005
