The Blair Witch Project," Instant Classic
","Being an avid viewer of horror films I've become a bit bored with the selection of recent horror titles these days. It seemed to me that no one had any original ideas out there in movie land. Well, that's what I thought until I saw The Blair Witch Project. This isn't a movie, it's art. The characters in this film are all normal and believable, which has become a rarity in horror. The fact that this film is so real is what gives it it's greatest impact. The way the movie is shot through hand held cameras makes you feel as if you're there as all the events are unfolding. Will this movie scare you? That depends. If you're a true horror fan then you're going to get the most from this movie. The fear of the unknown is truly going to scare you. But if you're part of this whole 'Scream Generation' of horror fans then you may not get everything this film has to offer. Oh, as a final note, you may want to take a few motion sickness pills before going to this movie if you're even the slightest bit prone to motion sickness.",10,2,3,1 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," Well made and entertaining film
","Despite the bad reviews by critics, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's a well made film with plenty of action and suspense. The only thing that I found to be lacking was drama. You never really feel yourself being pulled emotionally into the movie, but that's my only complaint. It still manages to be highly entertaining. I loved the way the film was set in the time of the Vikings. This is an era largely ignored by Hollywood so it was interesting to see how they lived and fought. I give it 8 out of 10 stars.",Null,0,0,15 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funny Funny Movie - Definitely NOT for kids
","If you're a fan of the television show, then you're gonna laugh so hard that your stomach hurts. The last time I laughed so hard was when I saw Monty Python's Search for the Holy Grail. This movie features more colorful language than a Tarantino film so leave the kiddies at home.",8,0,0,4 July 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Beautifully crafted and gory film
","Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a well crafted and beautifully designed horror/fantasy film. Depp's performance gives the film a bit of comic relief at just the right moments. Don't take your kids to see this one based on the classic Sleepy Hollow tale. When they said heads will roll, they meant it. This film is one of the goriest I've seen in a while. I give it 8/10 only because the story could have been better. On visuals this one gets a 10/10.",8,0,0,20 November 1999
Pitch Black," Stunning visuals aren't enough to help this film
","One word can sum up my 'Pitch Black' experience at the movies this past weekend. Dreadful. This movie suffers from a severe lack of talented actors/actresses and the script seems to have been written by a 9th grader with a potty mouth. The only thing that saves this film is the visuals. The landscapes, ships, and other planets all look amazing. The biggest treat here is the aliens themselves. Unfortunately they don't get enough screen time. The movie's not a total loss, but USA Films should stick to their tv movies (which still suck, but at least you don't have to pay to see them).",4,0,0,24 February 2000
American Beauty," A movie masterpiece that is nothing less than art
",It's very rare that you get a chance to see such a beautifully written and acted out film. Kevin Spacey delivers one of his most unforgettable characters. Don't be surprised to see him nominated for an Oscar. American Beauty is going to be known as one of the best films ever.....mark my words. Don't miss this one. 10/10,10,0,0,4 October 1999
American History X," One of the best movies I've ever seen
","This is a fantastic film. The movie's in your face nature shows the bitterness and hardship brought on by prejudices. This one definitely stands as one of the best movies of 98, and of all time.",10,0,0,8 July 1999
The Usual Suspects," All-Star Cast + Creative Plot= One of the best movies of all time
","It's been a long time since a movie shocked me as much as this one did. I'm not going to give anything about the movie away, but I was totally caught off guard. Whoever did the casting for this movie deserves a big pat on the back.",10,0,1,16 June 1999
Toy Story 2," This movie breaks the 'Stinky Sequel' mold
","This film proves that sequels don't have to stink. Those guys down at Pixar are magicians. There are times when you have to actually stop and realize that what you're looking at isn't real. In other words, the visuals are top notch. The story is great and it's filled with humor, not just for the kiddies, but for the rest of us too. This is a film that everyone can enjoy. I give it a 9/10",9,0,1,6 December 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," One of Kubrick's finest
","Anytime that you walk into the theater to see a Stanley Kubrick film you know to expect something unusual and exciting. Eyes Wide Shut is no exception. The storyline is gripping to the end, and leaves you thinking well after the movie is over. Excellent use of lighting and music add so much texture to the already strong story. Bizarre twists and compelling acting by Tom Cruise will keep you entertained until the credits roll. Fantastic movie!",9,0,0,21 July 1999
The Sixth Sense," All around great movie
","This is a finely crafted film. Bruce Willis does a great job as usual, but what is really unique is that he is overshadowed by Haley Joel Osment, whose character sets the mood for the whole movie. Fantastic casting job! Not only is this a great film, but it also has a rewarding ending which has become rare in Hollywood these days.",8,0,0,6 August 1999
