The Blair Witch Project," So overrated, it's scary
","Maybe the most amazing thing about 'The Blair Witch Project' is that it actually won an award at Sundance. At best, this movie plays like a mediocre student film. Save your ten bucks and see it on video, where it belongs. Don't be fooled by the hype. I don't have any doubt that there are hundreds of better low-budget films out there that have never got attention or distribution. Artisan, wake up and go find them.",Null,0,1,30 July 1999
The Matrix Reloaded," Well-crafted sequel to a modern classic
","It's hard to believe it's been four years already since 'The Matrix' was released. Much has happened in the world since then- the election debacle of 2000, the dot-com collapse and of course, 9/11. Given recent world events, it's tough to greet the release of 'The Matrix Reloaded' without feeling a sense of nostalgia for the bygone era that produced it's predecessor. The first film, a mixture of the cyberpunk literary genre, superhero fantasy, kung-fu and John Woo-style gunplay, with a touch of Zen philosophy thrown in for good measure, arrived on the scene with little hype or fanfare. The movie was quickly embraced as a modern classic, a superb synthesis of popular cinematic styles that staked out new territory with its visual effects, especially the now-famous 'bullet-time' concept that has subsequently been parodied or imitated in too many films to count. 'The Matrix' won four Academy awards, including a well-deserved victory in the visual effects category.'The Matrix Reloaded' is, in many ways, a far more ambitious picture. There is much to enjoy here, from the introduction of numerous new characters, to a more complex plot, to the last screen performance of actress Gloria Foster (The Oracle), and of course, fabulous visuals and action scenes. There is a scene involving a slice of chocolate cake that I found to be brilliant and very rich. The end result is a movie that is as thought-provoking as the original. A philosophical action movie for those who want a roundhouse kick to go with their koans.",10,0,0,6 June 2003
