Mission: Impossible III," mi3 = Tom Cruise infomercial
","This whole movie is basically an apology for his past relationships with women. MI3 is a continuation of his infamous interview on Oprah with a larger budget. The moral of the movie is that Tom Cruise is the best husband in the world, so please just forget about his previous relationships. The movie starts with him being the perfect husband at a cocktail party, and then becomes scene after scene of him being put in distress and ultimately sacrificing himself for his wife and then coming back from the dead because he is so in love with her. This movie reminds me of the action movies of the 80's where the hero kills bad guys with almost supernatural ability. This movie has very little to do with an elite espionage team. The only tactic they have is let Tom take care of everything. The action in this movie is pretty awesome, but just has way too many shots of cruise in agony because he cant stand being away from his wife. Oh well, at least each of these movies is done in a completely different way.",5,2,4,4 July 2006
