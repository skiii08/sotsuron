Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Different Generations Star Wars
","A lot of people don't like this film or indeed the entire new trilogy. Most are of the generation who had the chance to see the original trilogy on the big screen back in the 70's so they are biased in their judgement as they have an experience to compare the new trilogy to. I was born in 1990 and at eight years old when Episode one came out. I knew what star wars was but I hadn't seen any of the films and I didn't understand any of the mythos or story. I was hooked from the day I saw Phantom Menace and I just had to get more star wars into my system. I dug out my dads old VHS box set of the old trilogy and I watched them back to back (all in the wrong order at first) but i still loved everyone of them. If Episode one hadn't been there I doubt I would have bothered to watch those old cassettes and be the Jedi wannabe I am today.Duel of the fates is in my mind, my equivalent of the imperial march. Qui gon is my Ben, Padm√© my Leia, Maul my Vader etc etc. This Star Wars is as magical to me as the older generations' star wars is to them. Yes they bash it for its CGI overload and Jar Jar but you can find countless sci fi movies that are far worse than this.",10,0,2,24 September 2008
