Walk the Line," Great from start to finish..
","Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I'm not a Johnny Cash fan, although I've always admired his music. I actually went to see another movie, but chose Walk The Line because it was about to begin, and am I glad I did! Joaquin Phoenix gives a first rate performance that fully deserves the Oscar. He gets into the role so well, you feel you're seeing the movie from Cash's point of view. Added to that is Reese Witherspoons equally splendid performance - both actors manage to give a fully believable performance, which is difficult when portraying well-known characters.The scenes where Cash's older brother dies are chilling - Lucas Till makes Jack such a solid, likable character that his death is really tragic and sad.He and Ridge Canipe build up an excellent relationship early, and each actor must have a promising career ahead. They convey the hardships of that time so well without relying on overkill.Set in the context of changing times, social attitudes, and the pressures of Cash's fame, his family dynamics and his guilt over what happens to his brother, and surrounded by first rate music, this is a movie that deserved recommendation.",9,2,4,4 February 2006
12 Angry Men," Oh the heat!
","One of the best things about the movie is the way the temperature rises along with the tension, until the rainstorm begins - and with the rain, the jurors are themselves prisoners until they can agree a verdict. And the way the characters interact is as good as any movie I can think of. And Lee J Cobb's performance is stunning - as different from many other roles he played as can be. His portrayal of anger and frustration is outstanding. Henry Fonda is as assured as usual - the voice of reason - but Cobb plays a man driven by his own demons who finally breaks, and as he does so, the jury are at last speaking with one voice. Keeping the cast almost exclusively in the same room serves well to heighten the tense animosities which stretch and test the will of each participant.",10,0,1,13 November 2005
