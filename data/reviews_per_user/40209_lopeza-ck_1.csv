Scarface," Truly excellent
","One of the best films ever made. Al Pacino is excellent at portraying this Cuban refugee who wants to make it to the top by any means possible. The effects, the storyline and the characters all come together to make this film incredible. The story is a little slow to begin with but very exciting and is action packed as soon as the second scene begins. The film is very gory and the language is very strong and offensive but the film is a masterpiece. I not only enjoyed this film but now I am hooked. This film alone will turn you into an Al Pacino fan, as his acting is brilliant. The film is beautifully put together and the ending is truly one of the most memorable scenes of all time.",10,0,1,15 July 2005
