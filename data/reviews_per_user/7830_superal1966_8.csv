Skyfall," This is not the James Bond we have come to love over the years
","*Contains major spoilers*I think Craig is a good actor, but I'm still struggling with him being James Bond. That said, I went into Skyfall with an open mind and left with very mixed feelings.The plot was unoriginal; a list of agents and their alias' is stolen and a man responsible is threatening to leak the names to the world. Sure it's been done before, and however over the top and unrealistic the techno-hacking elements are, it doesn't matter. It does the job for an action spy film and that's what is important.Skyfall's main problem is that it forgets about it's own plot half way through. After the Enquiry I'm not sure if the list is ever mentioned again.What we are left with is the most elaborate and unbelievable 'revenge plot' that somehow manages to last around two hours. The film started out on the front foot, but for long periods of time not much really happened.However my biggest gripe with Skyfall is the same as with QoS. Bond not longer cares about collateral damage. The Bolivian Policemen in QoS, and in Skyfall Bond happily lets Silva snipe the guy in Shanghai among others. Perhaps more criminally, Bond doesn't make any effort to save Sévérine, a woman who he hours before promised he would free from the sex slave trade. This is not the James Bond we have come to love over the years.This leads me onto the next point. There is no Bond girl, unless you count either Sévérine, who played a minimal part, or Eve, who had very little screen time outside the first 15 minutes. I think it would be very generous to consider either a proper Bond girl.The action is there, but what is love about James Bond is completely absent. I'm not sure if anybody else is getting a little bored of motorbike chases going up and down steps in Istanbul or like cities?As with QoS, it's not Craig's fault, he can only work with the script he is given, but he really isn't James Bond.For a film that I have so many negative things to say about, I shouldn't have enjoyed watching it, but I did, it was okay. If Skyfall was a standalone film I would have definitely reacted differently. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, or maybe the James Bond universe covered up what is otherwise a poor film. I will never know.I imagine Craig will be back for a forth outing, so lets hope he is given something he can really work with next time. I'm finding it very hard to give a rating to. I'm going to stick with a 5 for it's few saving graces; it was entertaining in parts and has a couple of good action scenes, namely at the beginning and end.",5,11,26,7 November 2012
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Doesn't quite live up to Alice's promise
","*Contains minor spoilers*I'll start by saying that I definitely feel I need to watch Resident Evil Afterlife again to pass proper judgement. I loved the first three films, especially Extinction and I think I expected too much from it and was quite disappoint that Alice, at least it seems so, lost her powers early on.Added to this I must be one of the few people on the planet who doesn't like 3D films (I don't like wearing two pairs of glasses for two hours), I'm probably reviewing this with a slightly negative bias.Milla Jovovich again plays the part very well and I thought Ali Larter likewise, although I'm not sure why Wentworth Miller was there, he was good in Prison Break but that's it.Again my expectations let me down in that after Extinction I expected the entire fourth film to be about what was covered in ten minutes, but all in all I thought it was a weak plot. I though there was a fair bit of unexplained randomness, like the dude with the axe/hammer. What was he all about and how did he become like that, I'm sure things would be different if there were more of his kind about. I like the concept of Arcadia but I'm pretty sure it was a thousand times bigger on the inside that it looked from the outside.Again, we weren't really given any form of explanation as to what the device was on Claire's chest at the start of the film beyond it seemed to be mind controlling; and for a planet where there are next to no remaining survivors, more and more seem to appear for the sake of the plot. I feel the more people that are thrown into the mix the more it just becomes Alice against Umbrella rather than about the struggle of living in a desolate world.I suppose I will have to comment on the 3D which was impressive, but I wouldn't recommend viewing this purely because it showcases 3D.I loved the first three films and obviously this was a continuation, but I'd rather think of it as a film by itself as it doesn't do the promise at the end of the third film justice.I hope Alice's story will continue if only to do justice to what has become an overall entertaining series of films (the ending was so open I can't imagine there not being one).I don't really know what score to give this as I want to see it again when it comes out on DVD, but for now I'll go with my gut and give it a 6",6,2,4,25 September 2010
Orphan," Totally Unbelievable
","*Contains big spoilers*Where to start.Psychological horrors rely on believable characters. Peter Sarsgaard on the other hand was one of the most unbelievable characters from a film I've seen in a long time. It wasn't his fault but his character was a moron, pure and simple. After everything that had happened around Esther, and there was an awful lot, he still sided with her over his other children and wife. For somebody who was an architect how he could not put two and two together is beyond me, and for all his stupidity deserved to die. For those that liked The Orphan I really don't know how one could look past this, he was that unbelievably.Their two children baffled me as well. Perhaps they were scared, but after everything that they knew and saw at least one of them would have mentioned something, but The Orphan would have fallen at the first hurdle had they done so.The seduction scene. Esther turned out to be a 30-something in the film however Isabelle Fuhrman wasn't. I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination but I thought this scene was totally unnecessary and the film could have ended up in exactly the same place without the additional plot that she murders her foster families once the father spurns her sexual advances. Credit should be given to Vera Farmiga, I thought she did put in quite a good performance and was one of the very few positives that came from the film.To it's credit the twist in the film was one of the more clever twists I've seen for a while although once it was revealed the rest of the film was very predictable, but it certainly wasn't the worst ending I've seen.The stupidity of the father was bad enough but the whole adoption process was by far the worst part of this film. I don't know much about how it works but I'm pretty sure they would carry out backgrounds checks on a child before a family adopts her rather than after. The Sister only seemed to make a few phone calls to find out that there has been a lot of violence surrounding Esther, and only a little more research from the mother uncovered that she escaped from a mental institution in Estonia. For a film that needs to be believable it makes a total mockery of itself.Another issue I had with Orphan was it's pacing. At times it seemed to really drag out and I on occasions found myself having to resist giving up watching it, but on the grand scheme of things this didn't change my opinion of the film that greatly.I've been very critical of Orphan but the framework for a good film is there. A lot could have been done with the story but it felt like they had the initial idea and the twist planned out and just made up the rest as they went along to get from A to B. Totally unbelievable characters and too many large holes in the plot ruin Orphan in which there could have been a good film hiding.It's not all bad but it's definitely not good. 3/10.",3,6,9,23 May 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Part Boring, Part Overly Confusing.
","*Contains Spoilers*I haven't read the book, seen the TV adaptation and it's cinema release pretty much passed me by. I came into Tinker Tailor Solider Spy not knowing much aside from what the TV Guide said.The first hour or so of the film could have been summed up in 10 minutes. I kept waiting for it to get going, but it didn't. We were being constantly introduced to characters without really knowing who they are, or what relevance they had to a story that I was really trying to piece together. The character development in Tinker Tailor was very poor for a film that is held in such high regard. Colin Firth included, very little is told about any of the top MI6 agents that we are lead to suspect of being the mole, nor any of their motives. Gary Oldman aside, the characters that are developed well aren't as integral to the plot as those who aren't.In the second hour the film did start to get going. Unfortunately I found it to be overly confusing, and coupled with some 'major' characters non-existent development, hard to follow at times.It got to the point where I almost felt they randomly chose one of the MI6 agents to be the mole without any reasoning being his motives. Maybe I missed something in the second half after being bored by the first half, and perhaps I needed some prior knowledge, but I honestly couldn't have guessed who it was because nothing that happened would have lead to believe one way or the other.I sense that it could be a film I could enjoy a lot more on a second viewing, but the first hour was far too dull to bring myself to watch it. From the great reviews I wish I could have enjoyed it, but sadly, I didn't.",4,1,3,3 March 2012
Wanted," If no one told you that bullets flew straight
","**Spoilers**One of the themes running throughout this movie is fate; that things are because they are and we have to accept that, and that inevitably it is unavoidable. Yes I know bullets can't be bent round corners, but for the sake of Wanted, they can. Loom machines aren't able to real off names to be assassinated, but again, for the sake of Wanted, they can.I like Angelina Jolie and she is usually well cast, however it was only really half way through before she started to 'fit' her character perfectly. Upon watching the film again this isn't an issue but I feel she did seem a little awkward at times.It's hard not to compare James McAvoy to Keanu Reeves' Neo. Both Wesley and Neo start of their respective films in an inescapable rut, and while not as cool as Neo, James McAvoy also makes the transition with ease and Wesley becomes a very likable protagonist. I also thought Morgan Freeman played his part well, although the rest of the cast were only really background characters. I did like the Russian Vodka guy though!The plot was very cliché in parts ('You are my son'), and how Wesley managed to survive it all I don't know, but James Bond has managed it throughout the years. The first twenty minutes or so are a bit slow, but it quickly picks up and kept me more than entertained throughout.Wanted did borrow quite a lot from other films, but so what, there must have been a point in cinema where it's almost impossible not to borrow from other films.Wanted is film that plays on the ideas of revenge, retribution and fate, and throw in some cool action, a cliché ridden plot and likable characters and you have a very good film.",9,2,3,13 October 2010
Salt," It's impossible not to like Jolie in an intelligent James Bond
","*Contains Spoilers*Salt comes across as James Bond with an intelligent plot, and Salt never tries to be anything that it isn't and knows that at it's core it is an action film.The plot is very clever and gripping, and full of twists and turns throughout. In a nutshell Jolie is accused of being a Russian spy and has to try and clear her name, as the film progresses you are left constantly guessing which side she really is on.Sure in parts it becomes a little daft and in others totally unbelievable, and on occasions it was a bit confusing but there is more than enough decent action to make up for it. Russia is portrayed as your stereotypical Russia and likewise with the USA, but Salt isn't meant to be a factual documentary. Angelina Jolie plays Evelyn Salt perfectly and really brings the character to life and Liev Schreiber played the bad-good guy quite well although nearing the middle of the film his character started to become quite predictable, but he worked well alongside Jolie.It's impossible to dislike Jolie, she can actually act as well as play the heroine and Salt is a great film to sit and watching with a few beers on a Saturday night.Criticizing Salt for not being realistic is like criticizing the journey to work for being too boring.Salt is a solid 8/10 pushing 9/10 if you are really in the mood for an action film. It's a shame only allows whole numbers so I'm going to stick with the 8.",8,6,9,2 March 2011
Quantum of Solace," Fails on Every Level
","*Contains Spoilers*The plot wasn't a confusing one but I really didn't care about it that and lost so much interest in Quantum of Solace that at times I wasn't too sure what was going on. Despite being widely acclaimed, the same happened for me with Casino Royale. It got to the point where in some cases I did know who characters were, and when I did, I neither liked or disliked them. I tried to like Daniel Craig, I really tried, but he is an awful James Bond. Critically he has been well received as Bond but every car chase, ever fight, ever action scene I found myself wanting Craig to end up being the one thrown off a building.He doesn't have any the charm or charisma that James Bond should have and everything about him is far too serious; the scene in the hotel with Fields pretty much sums up everything that is wrong with Craig's Bond. Fields turns up to arrest Bond if he goes rogue but ends up in bed with him, this is nothing out of the ordinary except it just happens; there is no charm from Bond, no cringe worthy lines, no character interaction. It just happens.Bond going rogue is nothing new but throughout the entire film he actually felt like the bad guy and I actually ended up liking Greene far more. James Bond shooting and killing two perfectly innocent Bolivian policemen is not the James Bond we have come to love over the years, rogue or not, it's not an excuse. James Bond is actually the most unlikeable characters in this film.Although I think there was meant to be, there is no Bond girl in Quantum of Solace. Olga Kurylenko played the part well but like everybody else in this film, it wouldn't have made any difference if she wasn't in it.Gone are the totally over the top action scenes which have been replaced with far fetched chases and gun fights that are trying too hard to come across as realistic. Gone is any humour, gone is everything that I loved about James Bond.I think this is the core problem with Craig and the past two Bond films, and perhaps it's not Craig's fault, but Bond is trying to become realistic. It fails on every level.There are so many things wrong with Quantum of Solace, most not Craig's fault but it isn't helped by my dislike for him as James Bond.I'll watch pretty much any film through to the end if I've started watching it, and Quantum of Solace was no different but for a good part of it I just wanted it to end. From the awful song at the introduction to the ending credits I don't think I enjoyed it at any point and I wanted the good part of a couple of hours back.",2,16,21,26 March 2011
RED," Brilliant, Entertaining and Fun
","*Contains Spoilers*The underlying reason we watch movies is because they are entertaining, and Red is far the most fun film I have seen in a very long time.I didn't really know much Red before watching it and the short blurb gave no hint to it being a comedy, but what I ended up watching greatly exceeded my expectations. Breaking the plot down it was a little on the thin side but it cleverly uses comedy and of course lots of explosions to keep things going and it all fits together perfectly.Some of the one liners are brilliant and the action scenes are no less over the top than I'd hoped for. Pretty much every action film cliché is there but they are all used to the films advantage.Willis, Malkovich, Mirren and Morgan Freeman who put in good performances. Malkovich kept the comedy train moving along while Willis was in his element and although Morgan Freeman was great it was a shame he wasn't in more of the film. However Mary-Louise Parker stole the show for me. I haven't seen her in a great deal but I'm going to have to go back through her filmography, she was great and for me probably the one of the most likable characters in a long time.It's hard to describe the Red experience, it's not a film that is going to have you guessing what is going to happen next but it's enjoyable from start to finish. It's a holiday that you don't remember for where you were but more for the great time you had with your friends while there.A great film that comes with my highest possible recommendations 10/10",10,2,3,1 May 2011
