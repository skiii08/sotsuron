The Avengers," Avengers - 2012
","A repost from an old IMDB review.I'm happy to report that everything established in previous movies pays dividends in a big way. It's not that anyone needs to see those other Avenger solo films before seeing this gem but it certainly adds depth and texture to this amazing product. Not having to intro big main characters deeply allows the action to flow but also allows for better development. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. This heightens the tension, so often missing from comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the story as well as the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. The result is a film that's just flat out exceptional.Of course all the phenomenal heroes got to shine and the story accommodated them all perfectly. What I loved is that Marvel did it again with their main villain. Loki was just so wonderful and complex in this amazing movie. Spurned Loki masterfully dances on the fault lines of villainy and redemption. He always keep people guessing and. Again, that's just shear perfection coming from the god of mischief. He has such a mixture of emotional psychological complexity. You have somebody who's capable of thinking and strategizing at the speed of light, but underneath that is a deep well of pain that at any moment threatens to boil over and Tom Hiddleston plays it like the master he has become. This is Oscar worthy villain performance good.The performances in this movie are as good as any I've ever seen in an adventure film. The great actors say that acting akin to playing tennis. The rally that they play with a new partner is completely different from one to the other. Each of these GREAT actors have such specific talents that it's fun to see them play off each other at different times in this movie. I think Whedon realized this as both director and writer and shuffled things around on purpose to play to strengths. It's just another wonderful aspect of this spectacular movie event.",8,0,1,6 December 2018

","Stylish Bond movie. Sarcastic dialogue that is stunningly creative and extremely focused. The first half of the movie booms with excitement, thrills and style but the latter part lacks style and action .

Fight Club," David Fincher and his masterpiece
","David Fincher's (DF) masterpiece is Fight Club (FC) (1999).DF who's one of the most innovative and considered a great filmmaker himself worked really hard on producing FC.FC is an american film from 1999 based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk.The plot of the film is basically in summary is.......Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a 'Fight Club' with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel without a cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.This film is a cinematic feast. As a Sri Lankan film fanatic that troubled rebellious men is a talked about factor and loved by filmmakers and fans alike.Fight Club's got some hard hitting quotes for the audiences.Tyler Durden : The things you own end up owning you.Narrator : I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.Tyler Durden : It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.Tyler Durden : Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.Narrator : This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.Tyler Durden : You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fu*king Khakis. You're the all singing, all-dancing crap of the world.Tyler is like an annihilistic priest. His words are true but dangerous and if you blindly follow them it's chaos. And that is what you see in the film.DF's approach and style in films are basically follows.Fincher likes to map out camera movement with computer-generated imagery, commission intricate sets, gets heavily involved in post-production, and re-shoot footage after the principal photography has wrapped. He does not normally use hand-held cameras when he shoots a film, preferring cameras on a tripod, this most frequent use of a hand-held camera was for Se7en, in which five scenes were shot that way. Fincher likes to confuse audiences with his camerawork. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a shot is human-controlled, motion-controlled or computer-generated imagery. Close ups are as little as possible. The interior of a refrigerator can be seen in a number of Fincher's films; this can be seen as part of character and story development.All of these are in FC.As a Sri Lankan many films like Machan (2008), Mille Soya Buongiorno Italia (2004) and Motorcycle (2016) depicts the internal and external struggles of the youth and middle aged men of Sri Lanka.And FC will be the one and only depiction of the American man's perspective in 1990's on consumerism.",9,0,0,5 December 2018
Memento," Memento (2000) : Anything serving as a reminder or warning. [Dictionary.com]
","Memento (2000) by Christopher Nolan is one of the breakthrough films of his career and may be one of the greatest films ever made.Now that the audiences know this what can a Sri Lankan film fan like me can give new to the readers.Memento is a 2000 american neo-noir psychological thriller film after Nolan's 'Following (1998)' which was kind of the same film making which later becomes his world renowned iconic film making style.Like many of initial films Memento explores the dark human conditions and it's cold heartedness with psychopathy infused. And also he brings his great editing and story telling techniques to the film in a grand scale.This is a most talked about film and needs multiple viewings, Now with my busy schedules I only watched it once and I'm like really confused but awed by it's film making competence.The story is about a guy called Leonard as a result of a past trauma, suffers from anterograde amnesia, the inability to form new memories and suffers short-term memory loss approximately every five minutes. He is searching for the persons who attacked him and killed his wife, using an intricate system of Polaroid photographs and tattoos to track information he cannot remember. Memento is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed during the film: a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse order (simulating for the audience the mental state of the protagonist). The two sequences 'meet' at the end of the film, producing one complete and cohesive narrative.As a SL film for me Memento is unique noir classic with it's unique confusing narrative style which later becomes nolanites favourite in his films with haunting music, context, acting and depth. This becomes one of the best films ever put to screen in terms of crime and human condition with unique atmosphere.",9,0,0,5 December 2018
This Is the End," This is the end (2013)
","One of the last years best films for it's creativity and fun 'This is the end' lives up to the reputation of Seth Rogen and his cast who drives the movie into becoming a comic masterpiece. Mainly for it's sarcastic remarks, witty acting and most of all for it's real references and it's unforgettable ending this is a real comic treat.Overall - 4/5",8,1,2,28 April 2020
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games (2012)
","As I said in my review for 'Planet of the apes(2011)', there are no good Sci-fi movies these days this is one of them. I don't want to disrespect the readers who admire the book so much but as independent film fan the movie was not up to its reputation.The movie is sadly overrated in IMDB. The acting was bad. Direction was weak.Look at the scene from the film I downloaded. She is way to good looking for a hungered killing machine.Look at her clothes.They are too good for her character considering the novel's state of the character.The action sequences of this film was not thrilling as well. It should have been better.Considering 'Gamer' as in the same Genre it was far ahead of it's time.
My overall rating for this film is going to be very low for this because besides being an adaption.",5,0,0,6 December 2018

The Notebook," The note book (2004)
","I watched this because one of my friends forced me too. He said this is one of the greatest movies he has ever seen. Being a very insensitive person for love stories still I gave shot for TNB. Which surprisingly became an epic, classy story about love and freedom of life. I saw this movie not in the perspective of a love story but in a more different manner. It's cinematography was great. beautifully directed. and of all a celebration of humanity and life.It's about how time passes us by but memories live by among us forever.The thematic elements has being very well grasped by the director Nick Cassavetes.Overall rating - 3.5/5 Visually stunning. Magical story.",7,1,2,6 December 2018

Concussion," Concussion (2015)
","This film is one of Will Smith's new films that tries to bring him back to the film scene but fails to bring his usual dramatic style and substance may be due to lack of innovation in the film in my perspective.The film builds on an ordinary doctor who builds a case on NFL players and the unsafe nature of the sport due to the inherent concussions occured in the sport where in the long run creates a dangerous effect and create suicidal impacts to the sportsman and when Dr. Bennet Omalu (palyed by Will Smith) an immigrant from Africa discloses this in a medical magazine he faces a lot of threats and many negative impacts from the AFL making his personal and professional life destroyed and but later his theory was proved by the public making his sacrifice worthwhile.The only reason the film didn't worked out was in my opinion was that when I watched it, it reminded me of 'The Insider (1998)' which was a similar premise but was well executed. But it had some good dialogues and also a unique approach to sports films. Still the impact of the later film I established in the review gives me a lower standard to this film due to it's lack of execution as per the other movie.Anyway if you love Will Smith you're going to watch this anyway and he pulls of a good film.Overall - 3.5/5",7,0,0,28 April 2020

Black Mass," Black Mass (2015)
","A film with style of unique sensitivity and hard core violence this film takes a new perspective on crime drama with the style of the director, Scott Cooper. As usually Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance as Bulger. A true story director combines drama and non-fiction in pure artistic way through amazing cinematography and set design.One of the year's best performance as an actor Johnny Depp gives a performance of a lifetime but unfortunately not nominated.Overall - 3.5/5",7,0,0,28 April 2020
Suicide Squad," Suicide squad : Hit and miss
","Suicide squad (2016) was the third installment for the DC extended cinematic universe connecting with Batman V Superman : Dawn of Justice (2016), would have been an amazing cinematic experience seeing it's cast, budget and crew but sadly it's a hit and miss. And also story wise.The story is flat and unemotional. The DC extended universe did the same mistake with Man of steel (2013).There is soo much explosions and gun fights but no real experience. Only thing that keeps the film running is Will Smith's Deadshot performance.And after Heath Ledgers master of a performance as Joker in The Dark Knight (2008), Jared Leto was expected to with a higher benchmark.Since he is extremely talented and the teasers showed a different joker, expectations of the fans were extrelmely high.Sadly we have 10 minutes of an idiot of a performance, he is more of a gangster than a mastermind criminal sociopath we see in the Joker character arc in the comics, cartoons and past films.Harley Quinn by Margot Robbie was highly anticipated but also less performed. She's too funny and less action.David Ayer is a good director. Harsh times (2005), Street Kings (2008) and End of Watch (2012) are really good films.Sabotage(2014) and Fury(2014) are made in the Suicide squad formula reflecting on a set of different character arcs working together to a common goal, which makes the viewers expectation for Suicide Squad extremely high.But sadly like 'Sabotage(2014)' this fails spectacularly.The connectivity to the DC Extended universe is the other only thing that kept the film alive.Overall - 2.5/5",5,0,0,8 December 2018

The Revenant," Will 'The Revenant (2015)' revive Leo's Taboo in Oscar bad luck ?
",The new film of Leo Dicaprio which is highly acclaimed by the critics and fans is back in spotlight because it is now nominated for 12 oscars and it includes the best actor nomination as well.And Leo is not lucky with Oscars.But this film is unique. It is both monumental for the actor as well as for the director Alejandro González Iñárritu.Because it was built on hard work and dedication. And Leo had a hard time playing the role. He actually went on a strict diet and even stayed in the winter like climates to get into the act.In my perspective this will be his day.... Hopefully.,8,0,2,18 November 2019
Split," Split (2016) - Claustrophobia
","When you watched The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), M. Night Shyamalan's best two films and avoid many because you heard them sucked and then watch 2 random films like The Happening (2008) and After Earth (2013) which happens to be worse you see a clear decline in a director's talent.And then in 2016 he directs Split which is one of the greatest recoveries from earlier failures and how he expands his first cinematic universe from Unbreakable (2000) characters where he re- establishes the true M. Night Shyamalan film making style.If you watch M. Night Shyamalan's film there is a unique way of approach of tapping the character's internal struggles and psychology.After his two films Unbreakable (2000) and The Sixth Sense (1999) he failed to maintain this streak until Split, where the film making returns to a darker psychological aspects of a person who has split personality disorder. Kevin played by James Mcavoy plays a person with 24 distinct personality disorders living inside of him and the characters played by Mcavoy is a very strong depiction of a person having psychological problems.The best thing on this film is it's dark and atmosphere nature giving a claustrophobic experience to the viewers through dark and cinematic style unique to M. Night where he failed earlier but succeeded in Split (2016).So overall this is going to be a great M. Night Shyamalan film experience.For a descriptive review follow the below link....https://dimademoviefreak.blogspot.com/2017/04/split-2016- claustrophobia.html",8,0,2,3 September 2017

","Can anything be more awkward than this movie. I guess not.But for many claims this to be the funniest film of the year, and I don't see it. It's not that funny but extremely painful to watch.
So rating it 3/5 might surprise you. But still it recovers from it's flaws because it has a good cast.And capitalization on that is perfectly done.Overall - 3/5",6,0,1,28 April 2020

Divergent," Divergent (2014)
","With the premise of usual young adult science fictions 'Divergent' doesn't make something innovative as a film and with 'The Hunger Games (2012)' releasing first it prejudices the viewers perception. It was not well structured or even flowing with emotion in my perception since it was capitalizing on more establishing the base of the story among the viewers. The dream sequence of Tris is the only aspect I find innovative. Since I never read the trilogy I may not understand what the story may have for us in the future as a franchise but the initiation of the film series is very ineffective.But it has some plus points.1. Good visuals and well cinematographic vision (Well with that kinda budget what you should question is what you can't do on the visuals).
2. Good cast and mediocre acting.(Well the new actors are pretty famous now)
3. The hype of being a futuristic-same old - post war world sequence :-pOverall - 3/5",6,0,1,6 December 2018
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) - A moment when the filmmaker peaks his tradition
","The girl with the dragon tattoo (2011) film is based on Steig Larsson's swedish novel and this is the unforgettable adaptation by David Fincher.Rather than studying the plot I would like to discuss the film makers tradition of film making.In summary the film reflects journalist Mikael Blomkvist (Played by Daniel Craig) who is aided in his search for a woman who has been missing for forty years by Lisbeth Salander, a young computer hacker (Played by Rooney Mara). The film was nominated for five academy awards and won one academy award for best achievement in film editing.The both acting performances of lead actors were considered amazing and Rooney Mara was nominated for an oscar for her performance as Lisbeth Salander, The Girl with the dragon tattoo.Now in this discussion on a film maker peaking his tradition in his 2011 film, The discussion on his films in a chronological order will give a more broader perspective on tradition.David Fincher's debut film Alien 3 was supposed to be a great moment for him to establish himself in the industry. But unfortunately it didn't work out for him. I discuss these factors in my MovieFreak blog years back. (2012 - July)But he then created one of his best films Se7en (1995), The Game (1997), Fight Club (1999), Panic Room (2002), Zodiac (2007), The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2011) and Gone Girl (2014).Many or all of his films after Alien 3 are his own films that has a distinct iconic DF or David Fincher signature style.His films in a sense of thematically most of them studies psychopathy and the dark nature of humanity and it's macro level impact to society.His few films take a different approaches.His 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008)' was considered an amazing poetic and fantasy fused film with reference to the american history and culture with a perspective of a singular individual. Rather than dark themes and the dark atmosphere DF creates films with his unique technical competence which is editing and cinematography. Like 'The Big Fish' (2003) where Tim Burton fuses his tradition while 'Forrest Gump (1994)' by Robert Zemeckis this DF's singular fictional american story.'The Social Network (2010)' is the story of 'Facebook' may be his best film after his masterpiece 'Fight Club (1999)' in my opinion.Now this article is about TGWTDT(2011). This is a unique film on the darker aspects of human life with reference to the characters discussed in the summary. But like I said since many films of the director are based on the elements of human darkness and he specialises it through acting, editing and cinematography. The greatest technical competence of DF is his use of CGI and TGWTDT (2011) is his greatest film where you can't determine what is real and CGI because he made sure it to be that cool.And also thematically film maker becomes more and more symphonic in his artwork and in his tradition through heartlessness. And darkness not with atmosphere but with characters and he has peaked it in this film is quite amazing. The filming tone, camera movement and music is bleak and it makes TGWTDT (2011) a peak moment of the filmmakers tradition.",9,0,0,5 December 2018

","As 'Prometheus(2012)' the prequel to the science fiction masterpiece 'Alien(1979)' hits theater's I watched Aliens(1986) again and felt the same fear and the atmosphere of 'Alien' and I promise you it still is frightening and original after it's years of time.This contains the high tech effects ahead of time if I say in my own opinion. And still Rocks big time.I think the alien saga is going to be a masterpiece with 'Prometheus(2012)'.No comment on direction by James Cameron as usually he creates an epic atmosphere on the planet LV -221, stunning war scenes and fearsome jaw dropping acting.Overall rating - A legend in sci-fi cinema. For the time it was made it is ahead of many modern films as well.

Superman : Dawn of Justice (2016) and as usual Tony Stark and Steve Rogers also known as Iron Man and Captain America gives a stunning performance going to the core of there character arcs giving the fans the feels for the next movie's to come.The action, effects and story was unparalleled. But still when it comes to the definition of a film this is still a comic book adaptation.Unlike Watchmen(2009) and Deadpool(2016) which I find extremely original this is still in the standard formula.But two thumbs anyway.

","Unlike the predecessor which scared the hell out of many people, for me this has declined from the grandness and from terror as the predecessor.The Conjuring 2 expands the horror franchise going deeper into the Warren's family with a more deeper analysis in to there cases but this eventually loses track in overloading the substance and matter to the film. Unlike the predecessor where the horror and terror was primary, this film has given weight for many other aspects as well.Still James Wan has brought his signature moves to keep the film alive and powerful.Not scary as the hype in my perspective. But a good horror film and an amazing stylish turn for the genre as usual by the director.Overall - 3.5 / 5",7,0,1,28 April 2020

","Third and the final installment of the prequel trilogy of X-Men, Apocalypse creates a conclusion to the series not with the strength and the impact it had with X-Men : Days of Future Past (2012).They manage to recreate the greatest villain of all in X men universe but makes a complete fool out of him in my opinion through drifting in the story.Not well structured though manages to pull off a decent flick.Would have done better.Overall - 3/5",6,0,0,28 April 2020
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Tim Burton's The nightmare before christmas (1993)
",Now the 'Tim Burton's' is a very significant word in the title because it reflects on the style and substance of his film making but actually most of the work was done by the Director Henry Sellick.This is based on the characters of Tim whom I personally love because when you watch a film it reminds you of a different and a unique world of Tim Burton and his world is relaxing and captivating.Likewise this is the same. Though the credits are different the film is amazingly structured and we get the seasonal vibes.Beautifully structured cinematic universe within the world of Jack Skellington and his crew and also the interconnectivity with other seasons and earth makes this a beautiful film.Overall - 3.5/5,7,0,0,8 December 2018

Here Comes the Boom," Here comes the boom (2012)
",A typical Kevin James movie. Lame jokes and a misguided movie.Overall - 2/5,4,1,5,9 December 2018
Jurassic World," Jurrasic World
",Well though it was a hectic film with unprecedented visual effects the film lacks to grasp the originality of the 'Jurrasic Park'. What I want to point out is that the contribution made from the original film to the industry is not there in this film. The excessive visual effects is quite the same 'trump' card the new blockbuster films have always been playing without new innovative approaches for films. Comparatively 'Mad Max : Fury Road' is one of the best films I have watched with both Blockbuster and Classic fusion. We'll talk about this later with the 'worthy' films.Overall this film had so much potential and opportunity to make a blast in the industry but missed it. And kinda ruined a childhood favourite franchise.,6,0,1,6 December 2018
Logan," Logan (2017) - A 'Wolverine' Finale
","Logan (2017) is the final portrayal of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.Hugh was the first wolverine in cinema and he kicked ass.He created his own trilogy and this is the final installment of his trilogy.Logan is the very definition of a Wolverine film. It is highly dark and violent with a more noir and western fusion.Director James Mangold has said that Logan's influences included 'Visual reference points' of cinema, citing Shane (1953), The Cowboys (1972), Paper moon (1973), The Gauntlet (1977), Little miss sunshine (2006) and The wrestler (2008). They are very clearly seen when you watch closely.The conceptual niche's like 'Old Man Logan' and 'Post X-Men universe' is discussed in Logan.Overall one of the best films of the X-men universe with reference to Wolverine.Good bye... Hugh Jackman.... You'll be the best Wolverine ever.Overall - 4/5For a descriptive analysis follow the below link....https://dimademoviefreak.blogspot.com/2017/04/logan-2017-wolverine- finale.html",9,3,7,3 September 2017

The Artist," The Artist (2011) : A review
","Reviewing 'The Artist (2011)' is a tribute to the filmgoer. It's a film about films. It's a film about silent films.The story is set in Hollywood, 1927. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and will eventually set his oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo) it seems he sky's the limit, major movie stardom awaits for her.

In france it was nominated to ten 'Cesar Awards'. 'The Artist' has received the highest number of awards than any other french film in history.Why I love 'The Artist' is it's simplicity, humour and energy. In 2011 I was in a fresh state of mind. I was not exposed to many films. I watched 'Singing in the rain (1952)'. But this is different. This has Jean Dujardin and his as George Valentin you will never forget.It's a film about the beauty of film.Take your time to enjoy this films.",10,4,9,5 December 2018

This unravels an unforgettable adventure eventually leading to an emotional ending like the predecessor.The start of the film was dull and boring but eventually when the mystery unravels the story gets more interesting and fun.Animations and sound are colourful and unforgettable.Sigourney Weaver's cameo is fun and groundbreaking in entertainment wise.Characters like Bailey, Hank, Destiny and the sea lion Gerald lights the story amazingly.A really emotional and good sequel for the animation film genre.Overall - 3.5/5",7,0,1,28 April 2020
Arrival," Arrival : Language, time and life
","Denis Villeneuve is a modern day Hitchcock, his heart wrenching unique thrillers and deep rooted character based story arcs reminds of films we loved and we missed, but he makes them in his modern tradition.His Prisoners (2013) and Enemy (2014) are very dark and is unique filmmaking, you only see in Denis's films itself.Sicario (2015) takes deeper roots into human condition relating to crime and drug activities which is also an addition to his deep and darker cinematic film making style.Arrival (2016) his latest film is a sci-fi based on an alien space craft appearance and it's communication through linguistics of the alien race translated by a language specialist Dr. Louise Banks played by Amy Adams. Her performance is remarkable.The depth of substance of the film is commendable. Aspects of civilisation and humanity like language, time and life are analysed and put to the screen in an amazing way by the filmmakers.This film is a Denis Villeneuve film with such expansion to his tradition. Unlike other films this is more filled with hope and love. He expands into the aspects of his slow swiftly camera work rather than being haunting like in his previous films into being a more poetic and like song of nature and humanity. It's a real upgrade in his tradition in my perspective.He explores femininity in his latest two films giving major roles to female leads.",7,1,3,5 December 2018
Prometheus," Prometheus (2012)
","A movie with more questions than answers, considering its the prequel for the 'Alien(1979)'. Anyway it has great visuals and stunningly directed by Ridley Scott. But the story line and the script lacks the vibe to keep the story going. Anyway overall it's not a bad movie, and a very well executed science fiction.",7,0,1,9 December 2018

Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Force Awakened.
",Star Wars : Episode VII : Force Awakens is a monumental film for any film fan.Any one who loves cinema loves 'Star wars'.The first trilogy was epic. It transformed the film industry and created a world wide phenomena.But the Prequel trilogy crash landed among critics and even fans.My perspective was that film director George Lucas focused on bigger themes and scope forgetting the basics of the franchise in the prequel trilogy.The basics was simple.The first trilogy was all about character depth and all the huge setting and background was just a support to develop the 'Star wars' universe. He went vice - versa in the prequels.The new episode is fresh and keeps us tensed and the depth all around is outstanding. It reminds of the past and nostalgia is consumating and amazing.New characters and old gives the fans an amazing reboot.And it is J.J. Abrams monumental achievement of being able to reboot the biggest Sci-Fi franchises in the industry. And he did it amazingly. Both 'Star Wars' and 'Star Trek' is head to head now.,8,2,15,18 November 2019

The third is the worst.So what more to say.Overall - 3/5",6,0,1,28 April 2020
The Cabin in the Woods," Cabin in the woods (2012)
","This film is a horror movie that is poking fun at horror movies and movies in general. So if you're looking for a film that you can cradle a scared lady-friend to, this is not the one.But the characters are so much more than clichés- in the movie they actually are noticing how they are falling/being cast into these roles and being less and less human, less and less themselves. That in itself has me tipping my hat to the writers. Joss Whedon you clever beast!As to it not being pure horror- that's the point of the movie. I was enjoying the commentary that the narrative made while it developed and because i didn't know where it was heading and why things were happening, it kept me on edge and interested to the very end.At one point I was sitting there thinking - wow this movie must have been so much fun to make! It was definitely fun to watch.overall - 3.5/5",7,0,0,9 December 2018
Joy," Joy (2015)
",This is a purely fictionalised film with a unique way of looking at life and in my perspective the film maker establishes a strong performance through external art and craft and also by unique character development.Obviously the film is unrealistic but the humour and dramatic portrayal is an amazing experimentation in cinema on my perspective.,7,0,0,28 April 2020

The Nice Guys," The Nice Guys (2016)
","This is a trademark Shane Black film.Dark humour, violence and atmosphere fused together with an amazing style and substance Shane Black might have just pulled off another classic to his filmography.Ryan Gosling and Russel Crowe plays unique witty but smart character arcs with the Shane Black style.A detective film with a unique taste, I personally believe is a great experience for modern filmgoers to have a different film experience.Overall - 4 / 5",8,1,2,28 April 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," Mad Max : Fury Road
","This is one of the best films ever produced by any action film maker. This is outstanding with effects, innovations and most of all the greatest story ever to be put on screen with such grand scale (Post apocalyptic themed).Loved it. One of my all time favourites.",10,0,2,6 December 2018
Warcraft," Warcraft : Feels like rain
",Warcraft (2016) was based on a video game which is 20 years old and still loved among video game fanatics globally.But I never played it. So the criticism by game fans and critics of making injustice to the video game's universe by the filmmaker's is invalid to me.So as film fanatic this was kind of like a drizzle to the fantasy film genre in a long time. Besides the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit franchise there were not many fantasy films in the modern context.The benchmark LOTR kept was intense and hard to achieve for another fantasy film but this tries okay with new innovative CGI and story arcs.The characters and emotions are flat. But that's what fantasy is.A really good fantasy action film.Overall - 3.5/5,7,1,1,8 December 2018
