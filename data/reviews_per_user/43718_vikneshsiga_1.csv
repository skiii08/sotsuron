Iron Man 3," Best marvel movie until avengers 2
","The movie was really good. It is like taking iron man and iron man 2 without problems. Ironman had a dark story and iron man 2 was focused on comedy. Ironman 3 have all this. I thought it has a dark story but it has a little dark story. It made the movie better. Robert Downey Jr really acts better than iron man 2. In fact, he acted better than in avengers. He is a man in stress after avengers.he really act it out. The visuals were amazing once again and the way tony uses Mark 47 is always funny in the movie. I thought the movie could be a little longer like 140 minutes but it ended in 130 minutes. It OK thought. I will like to see the movie again.",9,11,35,28 April 2013
