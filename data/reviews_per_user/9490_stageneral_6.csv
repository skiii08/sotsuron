The Rock," Why is this rated so highly?
","I don't look at IMDb until after I've seen a movie, but it's pretty rare that the IMDb rating is far off from what I would rate (or at least in the same general goodness or badness range). This is apparently one of those rare cases, though. I had to double check that I pulled up the right title when I saw a rating of 7.4 (at least at the time of this writing).I honestly can't understand what people see here. It's over 2 hours long, and I was watching the clock after the first hour, hoping it was getting near the end. I mean, it's a light enough action ride - I was leaning towards rating it a '5', but then the number of things that bothered me just kept mounting, and I finally decided '4' was more appropriate. Here's some of those things (I don't intend any significant spoilers, but clicked the spoiler alert just in case):<ul><li>The movie couldn't seem to decide whether it was a gritty war drama (lots of scowling, shooting, and F-bombs), or a slightly tongue-in-cheek action movie (comic relief characters, trying-to-be-witty dialogue). Heck, it even seemed like Nicolas Cage couldn't decide either, because he bounced back and forth between the two.</li></ul><ul><li>Similarly, a fair amount of carnage during the shooting scenes, but Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery dove, walked, or swam away from everything, no matter how many people were shooting, or how big the explosive device, or how far their bodies were thrown.</li></ul><ul><li>The characters were wooden and stereotypical. A flamboyant gay hair stylist? Some 'Sir, yes sir!' Marines, the wronged ex-con, the never-been-in-the-field agent, the trolley driver, ...</li></ul><ul><li>The plot was predictable and cliché</li></ul><ul><li>The drawn out shoot-em-up, crash-em-up sequences. I haven't seen so many cars trashed in a chase scene since the Blues Brothers. And geez, that Humvee didn't even get a broken headlight.</li></ul>In short, it was just one cliché scene after another, strung together over a tired and predictable story line. OK, I watched it in 2016. Maybe it was fresh in 1996 when it came out, but I find that hard to believe.",4,2,6,10 October 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Crazy range of ratings! Here's why :-) (spoilers)
","I'm flabbergasted at the number of '1' & '2' ratings. Seriously? You people need to watch more movies if you think this rates that low against all movies. There's a lot of REALLY bad movies out there, and this certainly doesn't fall into that category. At least it's not another movie of comic book superheroes throwing buses at each other :-). I know, you've got your Star Wars fanatics who are disappointed that this somehow violates the rules of the SW universe, but personally I put it in the top 3 with Empire Strikes Back, and the original Star Wars. Here's why (in no particular order).(spoilers coming)<ul><li>an excellent bridge story between the creation of Darth Vader, and the emergence of Luke (of COURSE there's a Death Star, people, that's what this part of the saga is about, for Pete's sake!)</li></ul><ul><li>a credible explanation for why the Death Star contained such a blatant vulnerability</li></ul><ul><li>a strong protagonist who is neither apologetic nor exploited for the fact that she is female.</li></ul><ul><li>K2SO the best comic relief of any of the movies - clever, a tad snarky, never stupid or over played</li></ul><ul><li>male/female leads who eventually develop a mutual respect for each other (as opposed to falling in love at first glance)</li></ul><ul><li>a darker, more realistic look at the cost of war (yes, the toll is bigger than one little Ewok friend)</li></ul><ul><li>a look inside the politics of the rebellion (and without all the convoluted plot lines of the prequel trilogy)</li></ul>So ignore the haters, watch the saga in sequence (Phantom Menace, Attack of Clones, Revenge of Sith, ROGUE ONE, New Hope, Empire Strikes Back, ...) and appreciate what a good movie this is!",9,2,6,24 November 2017
The Bourne Identity," It's nothing but a car chase...
","Maybe I would have enjoyed it more, or viewed it more objectively, if it had been called something else, but come on. If you're gonna name the movie the same as the book it is supposedly based on, shouldn't it at least resemble the original story?? Enjoy the movie for what it is - a non-stop action flic, but if you like suspense and spy-vs-spy stories, I recommend reading the Ludlum book for a completely different experience of the Bourne Identity.Here's some of the things that made the book interesting, but were nowhere to be found in the movie:BOOK SPOILERS FOLLOWThe piece-by-piece unraveling of Jason Bourne's true mission before he lost his memory.His violent abduction of Marie, and the slow turning of her feelings toward him.The traps and counter-traps in the spy-vs-spy duel with the assassin Carlos the Jackal.",3,3,6,27 August 2006
Mamma Mia!," Mainly disappointing
","Having seen & thoroughly enjoyed it on stage several times, most comments (pro & con) are based on the comparison to this. (I would give anything to have the first stage performance I saw on DVD!)Pros:<ul><li>The casting of everyone except Meryl Streep (including Pierce Brosnan), and particularly Amanda Seyfried - she was cute and enthusiastic, and her singing was fresh and nicely in character.</li></ul><ul><li>The setting and the scenery - gorgeous!</li></ul><ul><li>The music and the book (not unique to the movie, of course, but a huge part of what made this musical the success that it is!)</li></ul>Cons:<ul><li>Didn't like Meryl Streep's acting OR singing. (The singing could have been acceptable, but I've never seen a seasoned pro over-act so much = see 'Winner Takes it All' or numerous other scenes). To some extent, in musicals, you need to let the music do the talking.</li></ul><ul><li>Pierce Brosnan's singing. Sometimes it's a GOOD thing to either dub the stars, or select stars that can sing. Actually, while on the subject of the singing in general, whether you are an ABBA fan or not, nobody can deny that Agnetha Faltskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad could belt it out. One of the pleasures of the stage play was that they were great SINGERS. The closing mini-concert in the stage play was a treat - a chance to see some of the cast really cutting loose in a flashy performance. The analogous scene in the movie was a parody of that, at best.</li></ul><ul><li>Continuity - the screen version didn't flow as nicely as the stage play. Maybe it's because they didn't have to pace it to a live audience, or maybe it's because the editing chopped it up too much, or maybe they just screwed up.</li></ul><ul><li>I didn't think the 'Take a Chance' or 'Does Your Mother Know' scenes were nearly as funny as they should have been (or maybe I was just disappointed with the whole thing by then).</li></ul>Overall, you can probably tell, I was disappointed.",4,5,7,31 December 2008
Hitch," Call it a guilty pleasure, but it just keeps getting better
","So, it's been 4 years since this movie came out. I just finished one of many re-watches on DVD. I swear, it gets funnier every time. And it stands up - it just never gets old. It made me laugh out loud (again). The pacing is great. The chemistry between Will Smith and Kevin James is outstanding. They are just hilarious. And it's a cute romance (romances?). If you haven't seen it - ignore all reviews, make a batch of popcorn, and settle in for a fun watch. My favorite scenes - the last first kiss, and the speed-dating scene. Oh, and probably the dance instructions at Hitch's apartment. And some of the little touches are just icing on the cake. Like the music drop-off at the end of the scene where Hitch is talking to Sara through the door of her apartment. Enjoy!",10,0,0,28 February 2009
The Secret Life of Pets," Not much here
","Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a 'me too' money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was 'yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it'. The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel. Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing).",4,10,17,26 June 2017
