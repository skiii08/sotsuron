The Rock," Pure entertainment!
","This movie rocks! Pardon the pun. It's what cinema should be about - a pure adrenalin, non-stop thrill ride! Connery and Cage are great.The direction is superb, as is all of Bay's work. You can see he really knows how to use the camera for the greatest effect. He combines great visuals and a music score that really drives to story on and keeps us glued. The characters are about as rounded as they could be for an action film and the exposition is minimal.The script is tight and the editing real slick. This is one of my favorite movies of this genre. The climax and other set pieces are extremely well devised and executed. Bravo!!!",8,2,2,10 May 2005
