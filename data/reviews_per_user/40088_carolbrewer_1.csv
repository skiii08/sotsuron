Blade Runner 2049," 3 Hours of Nothing
","I'm not going to waste anymore time on this film than I did just by watching it. This is a disjointed, unimaginably boring film that is best suited as an advertisement for the original Blade Runner. Not because it reminds you of the original, but because it will make you absolutely crave a good film to get the bad taste out of your mouth.",1,3,6,30 December 2017
