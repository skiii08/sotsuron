The Mask," Like Looney Tunes Cartoons Brought To Life
","When you get someone like Jim Carey it's often hard to find a vehicle that's suited to their talents. No such problem here, with the manic, hyper energetic comedian fitting the role with utter ease. It was as if the whole idea was written with him in mind.Actually it's more likely that someone sat down one day & decided to see just how far they could push the new digital special effects of the day. Whatever, the results are pure lunacy.Carey, as mild mannered, down trodden Stanley Ipkiss is a bubbling pot of seething desires & emotions ready to boil over but forever with the lid firmly clamped down. He plays the part supremely, not overly sentimental (something of an achievement in today's Hollywood!) & always giving an air of the raging spirit within that is just itching to get out. It's like watching someone walk a tightrope.Jim Carey as The Mask is something of a whirlwind, quite literally. Who can forget the two stand out lines when the Mask takes over; 'Somebody stop me!' & 'Smokin'!'. These two lines sum the character up in a marvelous way.His dog, Milo, is also well done. How on earth some Hollywood exec didn't insist that it become some sentimental pooch I'll never know. Yes it is far too intelligent, far too useful, far too convenient, but it is excusable in the context of the film.The marginal story line about gansters, a bank heist & so on is merely a framework for Carey as the Mask to perform increasingly manic acrobatics on the screen. The references to cartoons, especially Wiley Coyote & Road Runner (perhaps the best, most imaginative cartoons ever made) are obvious. There is even a direct steal from a Bugs Bunny cartoon where it appears that the audience has stood up in front of you to applaud a performance as Carey gets handed an Oscar.The cops & the villains are all about as dumb as each other, which is the reasons why they're there. Carey as the Mask is the focus of all this, after all. Peter Riegert as Lt Kellaway & Peter Greene as the villanous Dorian Tyrell do the job well though & Tyrell even gets a shot at wearing the Mask with somewhat muted results. Let's face it, nothing compares to Carey's version.The pace wanes a little towards the end, but still contains an interesting twist, where the love lorn Carey discovers the truth about Amy Yasbeck's reporter & Cameron's Diaz's night club singer. It is  not what you'd expect. There are also some surprisingly good musical numbers, I bet that took some explaining in the studio board meetings!All in all a good laugh & the mark of this film is that several years later, after watching at least 3 times since release, a recent TV showing still made me laugh again.There'll never be another, perhaps that's as well as I doubt that the material would be so forthcoming, although it's a shame there won't be another helping of The Mask.",10,3,4,20 November 2002
Memento," What Is Reality Without Memory?
","This is the kind of film that I had almost given up hope of a Hollywood studio ever making. Can you imagine selling the idea to Hollywood exec's? I tried explaining the plot to a friend & couldn't even do it, even after seeing the film & understanding what was going on!The way the plot unfolds in reverse is a terrific idea, as it robs the audience of the usual narative mechanism, putting us in the position of the character, Leonard Shelby (an excellent Guy Pearce). This is written large during the chase scene, where he's running, but can't work out whther he's chasing someone, or being chased.Here's where the skill of the director, Christopher Nolan (who also has writing credits), comes to the fore. There is no sledgehammer-to-crack-a-nut plot lines. Natalie's character introduces us to the way Leonard can be maniplulated due to his short term memory loss & Leonard's own recolections of Sammy Jankis fills in some of the other blanks. After that you have to put two & two together. This is NOT 'Die Hard' where it's a case of events being set up like pins in a row, with the obvious intention of them being knocked down later, you have to think about this one & BOY will it make you think.In the end some may not work it out, but or those who do the prize is sweet. Enjoy.",10,0,1,26 June 2001
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Greek Island, Italians, Germans, WAR... Bad Acting!
","I remember the fuss & bother about the original book's publication & since then I've come across a seemingly endless number of people who've bought it, but never finished it. If the film is anything to go by, I can understand why.First of all the film has the natural advantage of being set in the Mediteranean, so you get the beautiful backgrounds of the sea, blue skies, lush olive groves & so on. Although I have no idea if it was filmed in the Greek islands that's what fills the screen & it's pleasing on the eye. The CGI German Stukas still look unreal, proving that the computer programmers have a long way to go even before they can replace objects, let alone people, but CGI is only to be expected when showing such rare aircraft in the massed formations used in World War 2. Gone are the days when films such as The Battle of Britain, or The Battle of Midway could be filmed with the real thing! Those ex-mlitary aircraft, once so plentiful to film studios when the airforces of the world fianlly got rid of their old piston engined fighters in the 1960s, have long since passed into museums & private collections.As for the story, well I kept waiting for something to happen & all I got were a few fizzles & ultimately dissapointment. What does happen is so predicatable it's not worth the wait. The too-ing & fro-ing between the characters played by John Hurt, Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz & Chris Bale is yawnfully cliched & tired old stuff. Oh yes, it's a love triangle... how novel....'scuse me while I catch up on my sleep. There was one minor highlight very early on, where the town fathers wouldn't surrender to the Italians & insisted on a German officer instead, but that was about it.It doesn't even try to maintain accuracy, like when the sea-mine is exploded. Yes it's nice to finally see something of what an explosion REALLY does & not what Hollywood likes to make you see, but the simple fact is that sea mines contained a ton or half a ton of explosives & despite the sand-bagged bunker Corelli used he'd be minced meat, quite literally so.Also, can anyone tell me if the Germans ever used landing craft with drop fronts? As far as I was aware they never had anything like this in WW2. Maybe I'm wrong, but I suspect that modern day landing craft were used as the sight of barges lazily ploughing their way across the Aegean wasn't so dramatic.As for the actors, well Nicholas Cage should give up hopes of ever putting on an accent ever again. It was AWFUL! Overall he wasn't convincing either, something I can't put my finger on, but he was woefully miscast in the part of Corelli.As for Penelope Cruz.....well she's as sour faced as ever & simply uninteresting. Although the latter may have been a product of the overall disinterest I had in the film I have since seen her in the far more interesting 'Blow' & the same impression lingered. She has a nice figure, no doubt about it, & the guys will cheer when she gets her top off for a roll in the hay with Corelli. But she's got that Audrey Hepburn thin neck/big head combination that looks like she will break at any moment. It also makes her look anorexic at times too.John Hurt ( the Brit') discharges his role with understated ease....aided by the fact that his character seemingly doesn't have much to do, despite being center stage for a lot of the time.Chris Bale wanders around as the third corner of the Cruz/Cage menage au trois, alternating between heroic, sympathetic, pathetic, to rebelious. All in all I'm left with the conclusion that the story simply doesn't give the actors enough to do. Nick Cage's Corelli does seemingly have an indestructable nature, he survives being bombed, shot & blown up (the sea mine incident), to return to his beloved greek girl (Cruz). The earthquake of 1947 is shown, why I don't know, maybe it was a real incident that had to be worked into the story, but it just seems to happen & what it's supposed to mean I'm not at all sure.It's hard to be so down on a movie, but that's the way it goes with something like this. I'm glad to say that the night wasn't wasted, I'd rented 'The Rutles', so had plenty to laugh at this week (a BBC comedy, half Monty Python, Half Saturday Night Live based on the life of the Beatles & the inspiration for 'This Is Spinal Tap'...try it, you won't be disapointed).For those who rent this on DVD, forget any bonus material, no cut scenes, out takes, behind the scenes, or 'making of' stuff, completeing on DVD the overall disapointment of the film.",Null,2,4,9 February 2002
Bloody Sunday," Irish Republican Terrorist Propaganda
","Unlike most who comment on this film I've been in Northern Ireland & seen the petty, small minded, nastyness that really lies behind the so called 'noble cause', a truth that lies in drug dealing, racketering, international terrorism & sheer thuggery. I find it ironic that there is also a complete lack of any sort of reference in this film to the Marxist roots of Irish terrorism & the support these people got from the US. This must be the only time that the people & government of the United States have given so much money, help & support to a band of Communists since the end of World War 2! What was Korea, Vietnam & the Cold War all supposed to be about then?The production values of the film also lend nothing to the experience, it's cheap & awful, with a wiggling camera that looks as if it's been suspended from a yo-yo. As an experiment to try to convey the immediacey of the times it's a worthy experiment, but it just doesn't work. What I can't figure out is why the producers didn't register the similar criticism of the TV show 'This Life' which used the same technique & attracted the same complaints. The accents I didn't have any trouble with, although I can understand why international audiences might.The story itself is pure B-S, slanted to the Republican side it loses all credibility by the end. Did members of the IRA open fire? Do you think those involved will ever come forward & admit to it? Are they even still alive? Certain political leaders try to convey that the army had never been shot at before Bloody Sunday, but anyone can read the coroners reports & see for themselves that the army had genuine concerns of ambush & sniper attacks. One major step forward though, for years the likes of Jerry 'I've Never Killed Anyone' Adams referred to the protestors as 'peaceful marchers', so at least this film has the guts to show that they were anything but peaceful. Such is the world of Northern Ireland, where the truth counts for nothing & if it rains on your day off 'It's the fault of the British Government'.In conclusion then 'nothing' is the word I would use for this film. It does little to shed new light, nothing to heal wounds, nothing to unveil the truth, nothing except to entrench existing views. It doesn't go into the Irish mentality that you can only solve problems with mindless violence, doesn't deal with the lack of sane community leadership, doesn't mention that the troops were there to initially protect the Catholics (which the Catholics welcomed) & that the progress that was being made regarding their problems was blown away by the mobs who rioted & expected to be rewarded for it afterwards.The history of Northern Ireland in the last 40 years is undoubtedly a tragedy for all concerned & a litany of opportunities thrown away time & time again, but this film just deals with one fragment which is easily cast in a highly partisan light. Of course it could have dealt with the wider issues, but that would be to undermine the message it tries to peddle & would put the Irish republicans & their cronies in a bad light. The film could have dealt with the inability of the people to accept the responsibility for the increasing mess they were getting themselves into, but it doesn't.0/10, a pile of rubbish, AVOID AVOID!",1,16,44,16 November 2002
"I, Robot"," Blade Runner Re Hashed With More Flash & Less Flare
","The titles say 'Based on a story by Issac Asimov'. If that means using the title of the original story & little else then yes, it is based on the Asimov story!It's predictable, a 1970s cop 'Buddy Movie' with CGI & flying cars. A good old 1950s paranoid Commie Hunt B movie wrapped up in a surprising amount of glitz.Yes, the CGI robots are amazing, sometimes acting better than the often wooden Will Smith, and it has to be said that the visuals do make up for some of the short comings. But........The story, as mentioned, is about as far removed from the Asimov original as you can get. Basically it's Frankenstein's Monster or Blade Runner, along with the usual 'Cop on the outside' clichés from a thousand previous clones (Die Hard, Leathal Weapon etc etc). The premise that a robot could subvert the 3 Rules of Robotics by themselves is a major deviation. Asimov has a robot who's rules were altered for a specific &, as thought by the story characters at the time, perfectly good reason. The result of this innocent alteration (a change to the 2nd law in only one robot) was to have disastrous repercussion. This is a telling allegory, a warning that what may seem to be so simple & harmless can have enormous consequences (remember the Arriane Rocket that exploded due to one misplaced character in its software!).Squint & you can see Tyrell at the head of US Robotics, or Ernst Blofeldt (007 villain) or Emporer Ming, wrapped up in slick, new millennium corporatism. You could almost see him shaving his head & sticking out his pinky as he says 'isn't that a little .... evil?' Ah, but I won't give the game away.As usual the brush strokes are broad, the characterisations somewhat clunky & the originality is down to zero. The CGI often takes the lead, admittedly being startling, but I cannot believe that this is what the future will look like in a little over 30 years time. Maybe 130 years, but definitely not before then.It's worth seeing, but there is better. Having said that there is, sadly, much, MUCH worse you can see so at least sci fi fans get something to immerse themselves in.",7,0,0,17 July 2004
Pearl Harbor," Watching this you wish the Japanese had won.
","Right now this awful film is suffering the final ignimony it truly deserves. Having hit the shelves on DVD it didn't sell & so is being knocked out at the same price but including another major release from the same studio. Even then, such an incentive can't shift 'Pearl Harbor' off the shelves. And people scoffed at Kevin Costner & 'Water World'!!!!As far as the story is concerned, well we all know the plot, a staggering torrent threatens to overwhelm us .............no, not the effect of the Japanese air attack on the Naval station at Pearl, I'm talking about the cliches & their effect on the audience. 'If anyone has finished with their popcorn can I borrow the bag, I'm going to barf!'.Oh, here we go, right in at the deep end. Childhood pals grow up in some Perfect Little America, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett).Ben Affleck goes off to England to fight the Nazis... he's shot down (predictably) presumed dead (you know he isn't really)& his best friend 'comforts' his now emotionally stranded girlfriend (Kate Beckinsale). Yawn, yawn yawn....can't you tell what's going to happen next? Broderrick returns... Zzzz Zzzz Zzzz... the friends fall out & everything that follows is played out to the tune of falling bombs, waving flags & running to battle stations while showing your muscles & good looks....Zzzzz Zzzz Zzzz.By the time the battle sequences started I was already beyond caring & could hardly keep my eyes open, but the caffeine in the coke I was drinking helped. I perked up a little when the bombs started falling, but this soon faded. The CGI aircraft, bombs, ships & explosions looked cheap & nasty & the little plot line that remained between the characters was continually tiresome, irritating & pathetically predictable.In the end I couldn't wait to get out & I regret having wasted time & money on such tripe. I don't often find so little positive to say about a movie, but this one takes the prize, beaten only by the indescribably awful 'Smokers'. The one & only bright spot in all this gloom is John Voight as President Roosevelt, but even this performance is overshadowed by the sheer boredom involved in getting so far & all that follows.Why Hollywood continues down the same old ludicrously dreadful lines I'll never know. One explanation I have heard is that people there are so afraid of making a decision that when Hollwyood executives get married they take 15 years to decide where to go on honeymoon. No one wants to decide, because if things go wrong they'll get the blame. The result is stagnation & this film reeks of it. Let's face it, if anyone has seen the equally 'by-the-numbers' tripe 'Titanic' then you've seen this version of Pearl Harbor. For the Japanese air attack read the iceberg, for Pearl Harbor read the Titanic. It's just another bucket load of the same, old same-old wrapped up in a different cover.Don't go anywhere near this film, stick to the infinitely superior 'Tora Tora Tora', which, despite it's age, is the definitive work on this piece of history.Hopefully Hollywood will learn from this mistake, but I doubt it.",1,1,2,21 April 2002
Moulin Rouge!," It's All About Love.... Or Is It All About Absinthe?
","Enough has already been written about the use of music & the luxurious imagery of this film, but one disturbing fact remains uncertain concerning what happens on screen.Things go pretty well up to a certain point, the young writer (McGregor) seemingly recounting his tale, the narcoleptic Argentinian dropping through a rotten floor into his apartments just after he arrives in Paris(if you've stayed in French hostelries you'll appreciate just how possible that would be in some of them!), an occurrence that leads to the meeting with Tolouse Latrec & his troupe. So far so good.Then they take their first sip of Absinthe, a powerful hallucinogenic drink, renowned for introducing people to 'The Green Fairy'. Sure enough up she pops, in the form of Kylie Minogue & to the voice of Ozzy Osbourne (no stranger to drugs himself). Now the film goes into hyperspace & the imagery aquires a twisted other worldlyness that persists, only broken by the odd reprise of McGregor's character sat at the typewriter tapping out what happened.Glasses of Absinthe are continually popping up throughout the film, suggesting further consumption. McGregor's hotel has another clue, with a faded advert for Absinthe to the right of his window. Although Absinthe was particularly popular & no doubt widely advertised & consumed, the way you are propelled through the gates of the Montmarte region once the first glass has been downed suggests that this is not merely attention to detail.The scenes from then on fit very well with an Acid trip. For instance it may be tempting to say that finding your true love makes you fell that you can dance on air, but is this really Baz Lerhman borowing from Buzby Berkley or Fred Astaire? True he borrow enough from others, but the trend that builds up is suspicious.Perhaps one of the final scenes is the most suggestive. Near the climax the Duke's asassin has a gun which is knocked out of his hand. The weapon exits via a window in the theatre & flies through the nightime Paris air, only to bang into the Eiffel Tower. In a clear breach of perspective the comparative sizes of the gun & tower have changed dramatically, with either the tower being shrunk or the gun being enlarged. Clearly something is not right here.All in all it seems that Baz Lerhman has been playing with our minds, something that Ridley Scott did with such skill in BLade Runner, only Lerhman is more up front about it. Maybe it is simply something else he has borrowed, like all the other references. But this doesn't make it a bad film.I don't think too much should be read into this, even if it's all just an attempt to mess with the viewer's mind. Let's face it what's more surreal that a bunch of kids & a nun in plain clothes suddenly breaking into song for no other reason than there's Nazis approaching? It worked for The Sound of Music & it shouldn't be forgotten that in the world of cinema real life ends when the lights go down & only restarts when you discover that you can't remember where you parked the car ..... & it's raining.On balance Moulon Rogue is a damned good tale, filled with high dudgeon, vivid characters & plenty of laughs. This is odd when compared to the publicity releases & trailers, as I was convinced that it was going to be dreary & dull, being dragged along by my wife who wanted to see it. Quite why the studio publicity machine has chosen not to even so much as suggest that you might well laugh at the antics of the on screen characters is quite beyond me. It's a pleasant surprise to see that Hollywood can still produce something as off the wall as this, which still retains mass market apeal.McGregor & Kidman are excellent...by the way in Ewan McGregor are we really looking at the next James Bond? Kidman is too thin for my liking & should eat a few Mars Bars (Rene Zellwegger in 'Bridget Jone's Diary' gained much admiration for her figure don't forget), but her performance can't be faulted. Jim Broadbent as Zeigler is as mixture of coldhearted ruthlessness & deep down softness, with a screen filling persona that is just right for the film. Jacek Koman as the narcoleptic Argetinian provides a wonderfully odd character that I don't think I've ever seen portrayed before. Richard Roxburgh get's his chance to ham it up completely as the Duke, driven to insane jealousy for Satine (Kidman), providing us with a classic villain whom you can almost see twirling his moustache & tying young heroines to the railway line.Sit back, enjoy the ride.",Null,0,1,14 June 2001
The Last Samurai," It's 'Dances With Wolves' in Japan
","Hmmm, let's see. An American soldier, battered by the effects of his home grown war, is sent to a far distant region. He eventually goes native & adopts a new culture completely alien to his own. When confronted with his past he is more & more driven to embrace his new identity.This isn't 'The Last Samurai' this is 'Dances with Wolves! The story line has been planted into 19th century Japan, with a few tweaks & adjustments. Another indication of the paucity of innovation in Hollywood these days, where no one makes a decision for fear of failure & anything successful is distilled into a formula & then flogged to death.Having said that the film is entertaining, with Cruise in his most interesting role since Minority Report. Enough has been said about everything else in this film for me to not have to repeat the same observations here.",8,1,2,27 June 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Delusional mathematician=interesting, Sane=Boring
","Spoilers Alert Ron Howard's best work yet is not without it's flaws. The story of John Nash is no doubt a difficult story to tackle, after all he developed the 'Game Theory' of economics which I read about & which gave me headaches for weeks after. Representing that in the film in any sort of depth would be very hard to do without alienating a vast population of cinema goers, although complex mathematical problems have been represented in an understandable & entertaining way before (most notably with the efforts of British code breakers & cracking the Nazi Enigma cyphers).Here's the dilemma then, as Russell Crowe's mumbling Nash descends into delusions the story is interesting. Ed Harris is spooky as the 'Big Brother' character called Parcher, who works in a world of spies & espionage. The slide from reality to unreality is very well done, you really can't tell that Nash has slipped his leash & wandered off into increasingly paranoid delusions unless you know the story already. From then on it's an occasionaly fast paced plot about breaking Russian codes, tracking suitcased sized atomic bombs that are being routed across the US by a radical faction of the Soviet military. All very James Bond & there's plenty to keep you glued to the screen.The reality takes a back seat, to the extent that you wonder just what on earth the world was doing to allow Nash to keep working in his lofty position while all this hallucination was going on. Now I can understand that you only have so much time, so much story line to devote & that avenues are explored at the expense of others, but if you don't know what John Nash's accomplishments were (his 'Game Theory' revolutionised economics) then you spend the rest of the film confused. Although his new theory is mentioned, a result of his university search for a completely original area of maths, only at the end is a passing reference made to the importance of his breakthrough. In fact I know some people who think that his unequaled contribution to the world & the reason why he was in such a good job, was the breaking of the above mentioned Soviet codes! This is an indication of how confusing the story can be & I know that it needs to be shown that Nash was delusional, but not at the risk of having the audience lose the plot!All this is due to the overstating of his delusional world, which is cleverly done, but there's far too much smoke & mirrors for the real story to emerge. For instance it is well into the second half of the film that you find out that his college room mate Charles (Paul Bettanay) is actually an illusion. This is skillfully done, it has to be said (the scene in Dr Rosen's (Christopher Plummer) office), but by then you have to sit & think far too much about dominant plot lines that have happened before. I'm all for films making you think, rather than the force fed cotton candy rubbish of Spielberg or Brockheimer, but I found the phase change too confusing. There really should have been a few more clues to build suspicion in the viewing public's mind.There are some hints. For instance there are several characters that never interact with the real world. They also never age, a vital point to Nash's eventual recognition of his illness & the way in which he managed to live with it. But it's far too subtle, to the point where the hints fade into obscurity & the importance is lost.Of course you go, 'Ooohhh' & 'Aaahhhh' when the truth is revealed, but then we have the second problem, we're back to dry reality & nothing interesting happens. It becomes a life struggle, a unique story non the less, as I don't know how many people have overcome their paranoid delusions simply by applying their on intelect. But rapidly it settles into well worn tracks that are dusted off yet again. Triumph over adversity, love conquers all, the value of friendship, blah blah blah. Iwas left thinking that having Parcher around was better!A final criticism revolves around the sound. Many years ago when Al Pacino & Robert Deniro came along we had a terrible series of 'mumbling' films, where you couldn't hear what on earth people were saying. This film is bordering on the same, with one minute explosions of sound, followed by long periods of 'what did he say????'. With modern sound production techniques there really is no excuse.Visually it is absolutely flawless, the cinematography flows without effort & the eye is constantly at ease with what is being shown. I like that, it's the way it should be. The music is well sorted out too, setting the mood very well without being obtrusive. This isn't a high octane thriller, so we're treated to a background sound track that stays there, adding to the flavour perfectly.The actors are also wonderful, although Russel Crowe mumbles far too much, as I said. Ed Harris is teriffic as the government spook, Parcher, fitting the 1950s suit & hat with a combination of attention holding aura & chilling malice. Jennifer Connelly is the long suffering wife, a part that doesn't give her much room for development, but she gets to flesh the part out as much as she can (like I said, some aspects of Nash's life get trimmed as the delusional world takes up so much time). Christopher Plummer as the psychiatrist Dr Rosen is a little disturbing, the line where he forciably takes Nash into hospital is somethign like 'I just want to talk with you', which you know means he's going to actually lock him up. None the less it's good to see Plummer still getting work & doing it very well indeed.One final point surrounds Nash's sexual preferences. I've heard from several gay that Nash went both ways, with a preference for men & that this wasn't shown. I've no idea how true this is, but if it is the case I don't think it's very fair to leave this out. After all if it's OK to have the subject of severe mental illness raised, why not his sexual orientation? Others, those who are more informed ont he subject, will have to explore that avenue.",7,0,1,30 June 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Tolkien's Experiences of World War 1 Played Out
","For me this film is both fantastic & disappointing. For a start let's get the negative out of the way. This final section of the trilogy is the one that deviates from the original story the most. For instance Shelob's part is almost sprinted through, Saruman simply disappears from sight, the Shire isn't wrecked & rebuilt & Sam is not seen to depart into the West (there's plenty more deviations too).However this is small citicism of probably one of the hardest stories to portray on film & Peter Jackson has done wonders, keeping the narrative faitful & gripping while avoiding the need to go as far as having to make a 4th film, which would surely have been necessary if he'd stuck to the book.What struck me the most, though, was the overwhelming clues & references to Tolkien's experiences of World War 1. Perhaps Jackson had this in mind when shooting the scenes, but reading the original book you can see that not much has been changed. Perhaps the most obvious is the scene where Frodo & Sam are struggling up the slopes of Mount Doom, amid the chaos & devastation, facing almost certain death Sam asks Frodo if he can remember the Shire. Squint a little & you can see them cowering in the trenches of the Somme or Ypres. Again & again this section of the story shows how ordinary, remarkably innocent creatures are propelled into inhuman adversity & somehow manage to prevail.It is no coincidence that the Hobbits come from The Shire, where so many volunteers for the ranks of the British Army were filled for the conflicts on Vimy Ridge & Paschendel, echoing the rural idyly of Lancashire, Worcestershire, Gloucestershire... all 'Shires'. In the previous section, The Two Towers, we see the Dead Marshes, a portrayal of the dead lying in the mud of Flanders after battle. Quietly Tolkein gets the horror out of his system & onto the page, wrapping it up in a tale of fantasy.This is why I was disappointed with the deletion of the scenes regarding the return to the SHire. In the original the wizard Saruman has set up camp there following his defeat by the Ents & has set about destroying the area. The party of Hobbits return to find smoking chimneys, machines, polluted rivers & sickly children. This is an allegory for the different England that awaited the return of surviving tropps following the armistice of 1918. England had industrialised to meet war demand, as well as adopting a new wave of mechanisation to make up for the loss of so many men to the war. Men returned to villages that were as changed as they were & perhaps this is what we see when Frodo & all who were affected by the ring finally set sail for the mystical 'West' where they will be healed & find peace.In all it is a fantastic effort, the whole trilogy is cohesive & masterfully brougght to the screen. Of course it had a good start in life due to the amazing story Tolkien wrote, but Jackosn has worked miracles with the film making process, stretching to new heights. In a Hollywood dominated world, where originality is sadly lacking & innovation all too often regarded as dangerous, Peter Jackson has triumphed over mediocrity & banality. Where others play it safe by remaking old favorites, Jackson has created something entirely new, a genuine trilogy, not something like 'Die Hard' where each offering is the same as the rest, only with a bigger budget & more cheesy one liners. It will be a VERY long time before anyone makes a film as good as this, let alone 3! And I doubt that anyone will be remaking this trilogy within our life time, unless they want to be compared very unfavorably to the original.",10,0,2,16 July 2004
The Wedding Singer," Adam Sandler can actually act????? WOW!
","A slight, romantic comedy that didn't provide too many laughs for me, but was OK in it's own way.What stands out in this early Adam Sandler offering is that Sandler actually acts. It's not anything deep & meaningful, but he actually plays someone who isn't exactly like Adam Sandler (unlike the atrocious rubbish he's churned out ever since).The story is predictable, it's been seen a thousand times before. Let's face it, apart from a few cosmetic alterations, this is a well worn path. Girl meets boy, boy is rich. Girl loves boy... or does she? Girl meets underdog, who's not rich but is 'wholesome' or some other trite excuse. Girl falls in love with second boy, first boy beats up second boy & so so & so on, blah blah blah.You just know that Sandler's character will end up in bed with a girl, just by chance, & that Barrymore will call round at that particular moment to declare her love only to be greeted by a semi dressed blonde or something.............. YAWN, isn't anything in Hollywood original these days?True it is funny to see a retrospective on the early 1980s, with one wedding present consisting of a $700 CD player, the gift bearer having to actually explain what a CD is! The hairstyles (including the 'Flock of Seagulls' reference) plus the music & clothes are all pretty well done, without being overdone. But the joke wears pretty thin after a while, even given the appearance of Billy Idol & the whole film sags under the burden of a plot line scraped from the very bottom of the barrel.Finally I must say that I do think that this is the best Adam Sandler film I've ever seen............ which wouldn't be difficult given the absolute rubbish he's made the rest of the time.",5,2,4,9 September 2002
