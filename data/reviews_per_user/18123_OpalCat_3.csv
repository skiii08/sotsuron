The Ring," Apparently this was supposed to be scary.
","This was supposed to be 'the scariest movie since Sixth Sense' ... which I suppose is apt, since neither Sixth Sense nor The Ring is scary.The music was well done--it set a scary mood even though the plot couldn't do so. There were some creepy scenes, and the brief glimpses we got of the scary special effects makeup were creepy... It seemed to me to be more of a mystery than a horror movie. We found ourselves laughing more often than being scared... and it wasn't because the movie wanted to have humorous parts. I also spent a lot of time wondering who punched the kid and gave him two black eyes...
Not to say that it wasn't kinda enjoyable, but I am glad I saw a matinee.",Null,0,0,24 November 2002
The Game," Worst movie ever.
","SPOILER!!! I'm actually in a bad mood now after seeing this movie. It is rare that a movie actually p***es me off, but this one did.I don't want to give away the plot, but let's just say that if it were me at the end... I'd have killed several people just for the satisfaction, and gone to prison willingly. That anyone would do that to someone they supposedly cared for... And then I'd have sued every single person involved.The fact that none of those things happened ruined the movie for me. The 'perps' got off, and they never should have. My sense of 'I'll show them' was completely unsatisfied.I give this movie a 0 out of 10.",1,53,97,9 March 2003
Mulholland Drive," It's either for you or it isn't. If it is, you'll love it.
","This is the sort of movie that takes time and repeated viewings to understand. That isn't the kind of thing some people like. For those people, I'd say.... go see a different movie.However, if you like weird movies that don't make sense right away, until you really think about them... I'd recommend this. Most David Lynch fans will enjoy the movie, I think.",Null,0,1,5 January 2003
