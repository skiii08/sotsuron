The Ring," Rachel was saved. But in the end she saw the video..again!
","SPOILER!!!!!Hey Everyone,There is just 1 thing that I don't get. Rachel was saved because she made a copy and let her ( ex-boyfriend ) see it! And that saved her. But in the end when Aiden shows the marks on his arm.. Rachel takes Aiden to the control room to copy the video. But you see Rachel watching the video again!! Doesn't that mean that Rachel has 7days again? Can anybody explain this to me? I mean maybe I'm just crazy. But please;). People you gotta help me'! Well I'll wait for reply!!See You,Greetz Randy!",Null,1,2,2 September 2003
