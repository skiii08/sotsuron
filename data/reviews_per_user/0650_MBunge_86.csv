"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," It's like Thandie Newton starting shooting this one day after she finished a Holocaust film
","This is a comedy made by some talented comedians who appear to have suffered some sort of humor amnesia and forgot how to tell a joke while making this film. I t's inconsistent, stuttering, shallow and doesn't understand that we've heard most of this joke before.Dennis Doyle (Simon Pegg) is a fairly big loser. 5 years ago, he ran out on his very lovely and very pregnant girlfriend Libby (Thandie Newton) on their wedding day. Now, he's a part-time dad to their son Jake (Matthew Fenton), a security guard at a lingerie shop, living in someone's basement like a college student taking his senior year for the 4th year in a row and sporting a pot belly like a Vietnamese pig. But when Libby starts dating the handsome, rich and seemingly perfect Witt (Hank Azaria), Dennis is finally inspired to do something with his life. In Dennis' case, that something is run and finish the London marathoneven though the race is in 3 weeks, the deadline to enter has passed and Dennis is in about as good of shape as a professional doughnut taster. Assisted by his best friend Gordon (Dylan Moran) and his fat, Indian landlord Mr. G (Harish Patel), Dennis sets out to prove to Libby and to himself that he can see something all the way through.That's only a basic outline of the plot of Run Fatboy Run but just off that, you could probably describe to me about 80% of what happens in this movie, scene by scene and almost word for word. This is an underdog story we've all seen many, many times before and there is absolutely no imagination brought to this version of it. There is not a single unexpected moment or surprise in the whole thing.Even a formulaic movie can be enjoyable if the formula is well executed, but it isn't in this case. Run Fatboy Run is waaaaaay too long, veers haphazardly from broad slapstick to quieter humor, screws up either the set up or the punch line of too many of its jokes and even messes up the big, heartfelt ending these films are always supposed to have. There are some funny moments but most of them are so disconnected from the story, they could be transplanted into dozens of other movies and be just as funny.There are so many elements that are simply 'off'. The film can never decide if Dennis Doyle is supposed to be funny or if he's supposed to be the normal point that funny stuff happens around. The movie starts with a guy leaving a pregnant woman at the altar, but then skips ahead 5 years and never shows us any of the real anger and heartache such an act would have produced. The script also piles one incentive on top of another for Dennis to finish the race to where you can't believe for even a second that it won't happen. There might as well have been subtitles on the bottom of the screen saying 'Here's yet another reason Dennis will have to overcome that moment of doubt we all know is coming and accomplish his dream'.I'd also like to point out that Thandie Newton is quite beautiful, but she's also rather disconcerting because she appears to be constructed out of pipe cleaners and toothpicks. She seems to be a naturally thin woman who's lost that 10 to 15 pounds they always ask you to lose in Hollywood, with the result that she looks like a fashion model who just escaped from a forced labor camp.Run Fatboy Run is a walking, talking cinematic cliché. It desperately needed filmmakers who would try something unconventional with it. Instead, they churned out another generic, empty, Hollywood concoction.",4,1,1,11 October 2010
The King's Speech," If only all Oscar-bait was as good as this
","Now this is a great film, combining narrative ambition with an urge to entertain the audience and a string of outstanding performances. A lot of Oscar-bait has only one or maybe two of those things. When all three of them come together, it's quite something to see.This is the story of King George VI (Colin Firth), starting when he was only the Duke of York and 2nd in line for the British throne behind his brother David (Guy Pierce). Most non-Brits are familiar with the older brother as Edward VIII, the man who gave up the throne for the love of a divorced American named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). That famed tale has made it to the screen before, but this movie adds more evidence to the claim that behind every great story is an even greater story waiting to be told.For the Duke of York was a lifelong and quite severe stammerer and The King's Speech is about how he overcame it with the love of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) and a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to help lead Britain through the darkest days of World War II. That's a little more interesting than star-crossed lovers, isn't it?The superb work of the cast is first thing to praise here. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are tremendous, Firth as a man trapped by both his impairment and his place in society and Rush as a man split between his thoroughly ordinary life and his unorthodox profession. Those two are then backed up by virtually flawless turns from actor after actor, with Helena Bonham Carter as the resolute Elizabeth and Guy Pierce as the non-malicious but terribly flawed David leading the way.Secondly, there are an amazing number of ideas woven together in this script. It's not just about a man overcoming a personal defect and the emotional scars it causes and was caused by. It also deals with the revolutionary effect 20th century communication technology would have on the role of constitutional monarch, the last time in modern history when a monarch would be called upon to be more than a tourist attraction, the terrible burden of responsibility without authority and the isolation of being seen as a king first by even your own daughters, the gathering storm of World War II, the epic scope of the British Empire and what it really meant, and how love and friendship are often the only things that get us through life.Thirdly, The King's Speech is a damn enjoyable film. It laces humor, both high and low, through the drama and neither dwells obsessively on any of its themes nor desperately reaches for profundity at any moment. I can imagine someone writing a play about George VI and Lionel Logue that's nothing but the two men talking in a room for two hours, focusing only on the stammer and the childhood trauma that possibly caused it. I can also imagine such a play being extremely well written. What I can't imagine is such a play being fun for most folks to sit through. The most impressive thing about this movie is that it never tries to impress you. These filmmaker understand the first job is to hold the audience's attention, not take them for granted as though the audience should feel privileged for being told a story.This is a splendid film on just about every level. If you haven't seen it, go out of your way to do so.",8,2,4,31 January 2011
Whip It," No bad guys = no movie
","This movie is like that first season of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Gene Roddenberry was falling all over himself to prove how much better his new show and new crew were than the old one. Part of that was the conceit that by the time of Picard and company, humanity had evolved to a point where no one argued with anyone else. There would be no conflict between any of the main characters, neither a cross word nor an evil eye. T hey were supposed to be above the sort of squabbling we saw from Kirk, Bones and Spock and it was only our excitement over finally having new Star Trek on TV that kept us from realizing how lame that was. A world where no one quarrels with anyone else might be a great place to live but it's a terrible thing to watch. These filmmakers echo Roddenberry's ego with their refusal to let anyone play the bad guy in Whip It. Without a bad guy, though, you not only have no real threat or challenge to your hero, you don't have much of a hero at all.Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a 17 year old girl in Bodeen, Texas. She works at the Oink Joint with her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) and is getting pushed into the beauty pageant world by her mother (Marcia Gay Harden). However, Bliss is hardly some pageant girl. She dresses like she stepped off the CD cover of some alternative rock band and wants something, anything more than the life she feels her mother nudging her into. Then Bliss discovers the world of roller derby and a team called the Hurl Scouts that play in nearby Austin. She lies about her age to join the league and becomes a star, all the while hiding her new hobby from her parents. Bliss even falls in first love with the lead singer of a band. Everything seems wonderful until, and I hope this won't be too much of a shock, it all goes wrong. Her parents find out about the derby, a competitor finds out Bliss is too young to be skating, she finds out her new boyfriend is apparently cheating on her, etc. Don't worry, though. Since everybody in this film is just so darn decent and good and honorable, nothing really bad (or meaningful) is allowed to happen.Other than far too much of Jimmy Fallon as a jagoff derby announcer, there's nothing else too dreadful about Whip It. Writer Shauna Cross and director Drew Barrymore create some believably funny and human relationships and come up with a surprisingly effective character in the male coach of the Hurl Scouts. Unfortunately, all that good work is undone by this movie's unwillingness to let any problem become too daunting or any person become too much of an a-hole. Let me give you some examples.Bliss's attraction to the roller derby only connects with the audience to the extent that it's a joyous escape from a miserable existence. If her life isn't miserable, than roller derby can't be anything more than a lark. If Bliss's mother were a controlling shrew living out her dreams through her daughter and if her father was emotionally distant and disconnected, if her job at the Oink Joint or her life at school were especially difficult or degrading, if she was facing abuse or deprivation or rejection or some kind, then you could cheer for her fleeing to the larger-than-life world of roller derby. But Cross and Barrymore go to great lengths to make sure Bliss' mom and dad are shockingly non-horrible in the eyes of the viewer. What little we see of her time at school or work is no worse than any other teenager's. Bliss' 17 year old life is pointedly devoid of trauma or tragedy. And that extends to pretty much everything in Whip It. It turns out the boyfriend she thought cheated on her may not have. The competitor who threatened to turn her in, decides she'd rather beat Bliss on the track. Every single person in this story who could have been a potential antagonist winds up neutered with niceness.These filmmakers also don't appear to understand that a motion picture is more than a series of scenes. Actions and events and even behavior is supposed to build one upon another until it leads to some kind of climax or resolution. That focus is lacking here. When we first meet the Hurl Scouts, they're a lovable band of losers who couldn't care less if they ever win match. As the film goes along, they become better and more competitive and care about winning. Then when the big championship battle comes against their arch rivals, they lose and suddenly winning is irrelevant to them and, clearly, it's supposed to be equally irrelevant to the audience. And it's not like they lose for a reason, like they decided there was something more important than winning. They just get beat and don't care.Whip It is a lot of tasty frosting covering a dry and tasteless birthday cake. If you're content to scrape off the frosting and enjoy that, it's not bad but everything underneath will leave you unsatisfied.",5,1,5,9 November 2011
The Avengers," Whedon is an amazing assembler
","I went to see this with a few friends and one of them described it probably as well as can be. He called it probably the best comic book adaptation he's ever seen. Of course, what it's adapting is one of those all out action issues so there's not a whole lot of depth and significance to what happens. This is about good energetically punching evil in the nose while Joss Whedon's style of comedy flows in and out like a rapid tide. But while you can't put this on the same narrative level as The Dark Knight or even Batman Begins or Superman II, this is one kick ass thrill ride of a motion picture. It is stuffed to the gills with so much great stuff that Whedon deserves some sort of award just for keeping it all from collapsing in on itself.Loki (Tom Hiddleston), the Asgardian god of mischief who was lost to the void at the end of the Thor movie, returns here in service to an alien horde. He comes to Earth and steals the tessaract, the glowing blue box from the Captain America movie, and seeks to use it to open a portal that will allow the alien army to invade and conquer the world. To stop him, super-spy Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson. Loki, meanwhile, uses his power to seize control of the minds of Professor Selvig (from the Thor movie) to construct his portal and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to assist him. A whole lot of fighting ensues, particularly on the incredible S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier and the streets and skies of New York City, as The Avengers try to defeat Loki and repel the alien threat.Let me say again, Joss Whedon does a tremendous job hear managing all the moving parts in this script and the production. There's a very large cast of characters and they're all put to some use and there are a whole lot of special effects and action scenes, nearly all of which are spectacular. There's also likely more humor here than in any Marvel super-hero flick to date and while some of it is a bit much in that way Whedon always goes for a laugh just as the tension or drama is kicking into high gear, most of it is simply damn funny.Unsurprisingly, Robert Downey Jr. and Tony Stark pretty much owns every scene he's in, but Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo prove to be excellent sparring partner for RDJ in their scenes together. Scarlett Johansson is also very effective in a surprisingly large role. Whedon is known for his female characters and he's taken Jonhasson's window dressing role from Iron Man II and remade her into a tough, smart woman who still blanches a bit at being normal amongst geniuses, super-humans and extradimensional gods. I do have to say that large doses of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury turns out to a better idea in theory than in practice, sort of like Mace Windu, but Cobie Smulders does a nice job as S.H.I.E.L.D agent Maria Hill and Clark Gregg is wonderful as Agent Coulson.If you're looking for a good time, I'm not sure there's any way you'll be disappointed by The Avengers. If you are, maybe you need to stop going to see this kind of films. I wasn't that impressed with either the Thor or Captain America movies and felt Iron Man II was burdened with having too much stuff crammed into it. I am impressed with this film, even though it's packed to the brim with even more. It's made me excited about a possible Black Widow movie and hopeful of seeing Ruffalo in yet another Hulk film, as long as Whedon's involved.Not that you need to hear this from me, but don't miss this.",7,3,8,7 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," I hope Rachel McAdams didn't let the door hit her in the ass on the way out
","2009's Sherlock Holmes was something of a stylish mess, redeemed almost entirely by the superb performances and chemistry of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law as the world's greatest consulting detective and his faithful friend, Dr. Watson. When this sequel finally gets up to speed, it's a better film in many ways. Before that, though, it spends a surprisingly long time floundering on screen in a very obvious and labored fashion. In both movies, it's almost like director Guy Ritchie struggles to admit to himself that he's taken Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic characters and reimagined them as a mixture of James Bond, Lethal Weapon and Matrix/300 special effects. I think Richie's version is invigorating but, goodness gracious, he seems to have a lot of trouble marrying that vision to competent plot.In this go round, Holmes and Watson need the help of a gypsy fortune teller (Noomi Rapace) to stop Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris) from staring a world war before the 20th century arrives. When the master of deduction and the Napoleon of crime come face to face for the first time, the movie clicks into gear and everything after that is a pretty fun adventure. Before that meeting, however, much of A Game of Shadows is problematic at best. The story takes forever in establishing its point and defining its main conflict, and not in a 'it's a mystery' sort of way. It's more like a 'these filmmakers don't know what the heck they're doing' sort of thing. The wedding of Dr. Watson is treated as a very big deal when, let's be honest, would anyone have cared if they'd simply broken off the engagement and restored Watson and Holmes to their Odd Couple status? On the other hand, Holmes' smarter brother Mycroft (Stephen Fry) is introduced in an abrupt and anti-climatic manner. Even though he's just plot device and comic relief, it feels like there should have been a bigger deal made out of him if Mycroft was going to be used at all.This movie also makes the most publicly implicit acknowledgment of and apology for poor casting that I've ever seen in a motion picture. You can't tell me that if Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler had seemed more like Holmes' equal and less like his niece in the first film, the character would have suffered the same fate in this sequel. On the other hand, Noomi Rapace fits in very well with RDJ and Law. Not only does her character play a more believable role in the story and doesn't get shoved into some romantic entanglement with Holmes, but Rapace's more exotic, striking beauty meshes better with the grubbed up handsomeness of RDJ and Law.Jared Harris deserves credit for his performance as well. It's not easy to be the counterpoint to an actor as talented and magnetic as RDJ, especially when your role is much quieter and less ostentatious. Harris' coldly commanding Victorian gentleman is easily the equal of the roguish Holmes and makes the viewer entirely believe that Moriarty may just be the smarter of the two. And director Ritchie, while indulging in lots of slo-motion punchy/explodey stuff, extended the battle as much into the mental realm and creates a genuine battle of wits that, like Conan Doyle's tales, the audience may not be able to anticipate but can always appreciate at the end.Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows still isn't as good as its two stars. But while it takes a clear step back at the start, the film manages to take two steps forward by its conclusion. I still hope RDJ and Law can get at least one Holmes movie where the script can live up to their outstanding work.",6,2,5,19 December 2011
Requiem for a Dream," Beautifully horrible
","Requiem for a Dream is a mesmerizing and ultimately startling look at the horrors of addiction. Its visual electricity and propulsive dramatic decent make you feel like you're on a roller coaster that's going up and down at the same time.This film covers three seasons in the lives of four people. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is an old Jewish widow living in a Brighton Beach apartment. The story begins in summer, as Sara's junkie son Harry (Jared Leto) takes her old TV for the umpteenth time to pawn it for drug money. Sara has become terribly afraid of her son, but Harry is too wrapped up in himself to recognize his mother's fear or his own awful behavior. Harry uses the money from pawning the TV to get high with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), while Sara sits in her apartment watching the same weight loss infomercial over and over and over.Then two things happen to send the already unfortunate lives of these four people down a dark and vicious path. Sara gets a call that she's been selected to be on a game show and Harry and Tyrone decide to become drug dealers in addition to junkies. Sara becomes obsessed with showing up on TV looking exactly like she did in Harry's high school graduation photo, so she dyes her hair and goes to a quack doctor for 'diet pills' that will let her fit into the red dress she was wearing in the photo. Meanwhile, Harry and Tyrone start selling heroin on the street and are so wildly successful that Harry makes enough money for Marion and him to start a clothing store.But as summer turns to fall turns to winter, things go from bad to worse to horrific. Sara becomes addicted to the 'diet pills', gulping down more and more and being battered by mood swings and disturbing hallucinations. Tyrone gets caught up in the middle of a drug killing, forcing Harry to use most of their money to bail him out. That puts them in a hole they're never able to crawl their way out of. As madness chews up Sara's mind, Harry, Tyrone and Marion are forced to consider and then do more and more awful things to get the drugs and money they're convinced will fix their lives. When the end finally comes, Sara and Harry fly completely apart while Tyrone and Marion keep grinding away through their torturous livesand it's not clear which are worse off.Requiem of a Dream is based on a book of the same name. The author, Hubert Selby Jr., helped co-writer/director Darren Aronofsky create this film. But most movies adapted from books face the same challenge. Motion pictures are, by their very nature, all about motion and things happening. That makes them very sensitive to plot. A lot of very good books, however, don't have very good plots and emphasize other aspects of storytelling. When you take the story from the book and try to make it a film, those poor plots usually become much more prominent and the story suffers for it.Aronofsky faces that threatening obstacle here. The plot of Requiem for a Dream is no more complicated or involved than this - 'A woman, her son and his friends get caught up in drugs and progressively more and more terrible crap happens to them'. That's not a lot to sustain a 102 minute long movie. Aronofsky confronts that problem head on by using a dizzying array of visual techniques to substitute mental and emotional movement for physical action. He uses split screens, extreme close ups, slow motion, fast motion, stop motion, montages, special effects and blends and divides the images of this film in just about every way you can imagine. Instead of it being about what the characters are doing, it becomes about the imagery is showing us how the characters are experiencing their own increasingly sad and sordid lives.Requiem of a Dream is about how addiction, and not only to drugs, takes a hold of those who turn to it as a respite from their own unhappiness. Not only does the respite turn out to be brief, but the addiction ends up magnifying and intensifying everything that made you unhappy in the first place.Aronofsky's superb direction is complimented by some very good acting from the cast, particularly from Ellen Burstyn. She got an Academy Award nomination for this role and it's as deserved a nomination as any actress has ever received. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans are no slouches, either. There's a deep vein of desperation running through each of their characters and they show you how each character's nature deals with that desperation in different ways.Now, watching 4 human beings destroy themselves in rather gruesome detail is not everyone's cup of tea. This movie is definitely NOT casual entertainment. If you're looking for something that explores human darkness without wallowing in it, while dazzling you with virtuoso filmmaking, Requiem for a Dream is a must-see.",8,2,3,28 February 2011
The Young Victoria," Not bad, but too much spinning around an empty center.
","The Young Victoria is a love letter to the long-reigning monarch who largely defined what we think of as the British Empire. It looks sumptuous and features an array of pinpoint performances but is ultimately a case of biting off more than it can chew. There are simply too many things bouncing into each other in this story and some of them are far less interesting than the rest.The film covers the time immediately surrounding Victoria's ascension to the throne in 1837, from her struggles to escape the infantilizing control of her mother and her mother's abusive lover to her infatuation with the great politician Lord Melbourne to her at times balky love with the eventual Price Albertand that's the problem. Any one of those stages in Victoria's life would have made an excellent movie. Throwing them all together in a movie that doesn't even last 2 hours produces a motion picture that can never be more than tantalizing at best and is a little dull at worst.As it's presented here, the Duchess of Kent (Miranda Richardson) and her dominating consort Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) tried to brainwash the young Victoria (Emily Blunt) into becoming their easily manipulated vassal. The glimpses we get of the physical and intellectual limitations they enforced upon her to mold her mind and heart and Victoria's struggles to resist are interesting, but it's all done in too abbreviated a fashion.Likewise, Victoria's platonic dependence on Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany), his efforts to use that for his political advantage and the awful consequences of that to Queen and country make up a fascinating look at 19th century British society, but nearly all of the important developments occur too quickly or too much off camera to build into anything.And the love of Victoria and Albert (Rupert Friend) is a very well executed version of 19th century romance, where the lovers spend more time apart than together and whose love is more theoretical than actual. But the characters spend so little time together and Albert has so little to do with the rest of the film, the audience cannot invest the relationship with enough emotion to sustain its appeal.The only thing that falls truly flat is the royal intrigue that surrounds Victoria and may very well reflect what happened around the real queen. In retrospect, however, it all seems silly and The Young Victoria doesn't recognize that. By this time in history, the monarchy still retained enormous informal power as the heart and soul of British life while the monarch was left with virtually no legitimate authority or genuine responsibility. That means all the plots and schemes that people may or may not have spun involving the Queen and her favor have nothing real to grab onto or stand upon.For example, King Leopold (Thomas Kretschmann) of Belgium sought to use Albert as an agent of influence to win British support for his kingdom. Albert eventually refuses to go along, but what if he hadn't? What if Albert has sought to push Victoria into using British might to prop up Leopold? Even if Victoria had been taken in by such a plan, nothing would or could have come of it. No 19th century British parliament was going to spend coin or blood for a foreign sovereign because the queen would ask, command or beg. Queen Victoria's capacity to influence matters of state was practically nil and the same problem undermines all of the other palace machinations. We can now see that even if they were successful, it wouldn't have mattered.Unlike The King's Speech, which also dealt with a great many different issues touching on the British throne a century after Victoria's coronation, this production has no central, animating core providing a dramatic structure and direction. This certainly isn't a bad film, but it's only able to walk and you keep expecting it to run. If you like British period pieces, you'd surely enjoy this one. If those kind of movies leave you cold, The Young Victoria won't warm you up.",5,6,9,19 May 2011
Marie Antoinette," Coppola runs out of ideas pretty quickly with this thing
","Do you remember that remake of Romeo and Juliet that starred Leonardo DeCaprio and Claire Danes? You know, the one where they fused The Bard with the look and sound of MTV (the one that used to play music videos and not inane reality shows about sub-literate white trash)? That's sort of what this film is like except instead of springing from the mind of Shakespeare, this version of history comes dribbling out of Sofia Coppola.Based fairly loosely (even by Hollywood standards) on the life of the ill fated and historically maligned Queen of France, Marie Antoinette starts out pretty good. Beginning with young Marie (Kirsten Dunst) being swept away from her Austrian home to wed the grandson of the French king, Coppola and Dunst combine to paint and engaging and sympathetic picture of girl stranded in an exotic and intimidating land with the weight of two kingdoms placed on her slender shoulders. Using remarkably little dialog, they let you feel what Marie might have felt as she was bound in matrimony to the sweetly sad and seemingly asexual lad who would become Louis XVI (Jason Schwartzman) and placed at the heart of the complex and bizarre protocol of the French royal court of the late 18th century.There's little attempt to portray either Marie or Louis with any historically accurate mannerisms and Dunst and Schwartzman bring a very modern sensibility to the roles. In their case, it helps you to appreciate these historical figures as real human beings. When Rip Torn and Asia Argento try to do the same thing as the French king and his mistress, the results are unfortunate. Modern pop songs are also splashed throughout the movie, sometimes to good effect and sometimes like a balpeen hammer to the forehead.However, after being very successful at introducing you to Marie and the strange new world she's thrown into, the movie starts to drag and then splinters apart. It's like Coppola had a very good understanding of what she wanted young Marie to be like and a firm grasp of how to tell the story of her early days at the royal court. But as Marie grew into her position as the future queen and became an established part of royal society, it's like Coppola didn't have the slightest clue what that Marie was like and had no idea what to do with that part of her life. The second half of the film is an exercise in Coppola throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. In one scene, Marie is a spendthrift fashionista. In another, she's a naturalist with a bent for philosophy. In one moment, she's happily in love with her odd little Louis and in another, she's having an affair for nothing but selfish lust. Supporting characters are set up as being important to the story and then simply forgotten. And none of it is connected in any way to make any point. Without giving you anything to hold your interest, you're left just wanting the movie to hurry up and get to the ending that you know is coming.Aside from a minor implication that supporting the American Revolution helped bankrupt the French monarchy and spur the French Revolution, this movie never addresses any of the great and terrible problems that wracked France during the reign of Louis XVI and Marie. The people of France are shown only at the very end of the film and then as nothing but an undifferentiated mob. I don't think there's ever been a book, play or movie made about the time of the French Revolution that would teach you less about the subject than this thing.After a promising start, Marie Antoinette sputters and stumbles to an unsatisfying end. Dunst is unconditionally adorable but even her profound charms can't salvage this half-cooked casserole of a film.",4,1,2,9 December 2010
Star Trek," Fun and energetic, but let's be honest. It's not much of a Star Trek movie.
","This movie is big, loud, exciting, fresher and more energetic than anything from Star Trek in well over a decade. That doesn't mean it's any good, though.I could try and go into the plot, which involves time travel, an alternate time line and an assload of black holes, but let's be honest. This movie should really be titled Star Trek Muppet Babies. It's the original crew back when they were roughly the same age as the cast of Gossip Girl. There's really not much else to the story, aside from the best special effects in the history of the franchise. The plot isn't more than an excuse for the characters to rush around, get into fights and make funny quips. As a summer movie thrill ride, it's pretty good. In fact, it's better at that than the first big movie of summer 2009 (which now apparently starts in May), X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So, if you're nostalgic or just looking to turn your brain off for a couple of hoursyou'll probably enjoy this filmHowever, Star Trek has a great many flaws. To start with, this is probably the most scientifically ignorant story to ever come out of the Star Trek franchise. The original series was much smarter about science than this thing. Next Gen, DS9, Voyager, Enterprise and all of the other Star Trek films are smarter than this. Yes, even Star Trek 5: The Final Frontier doesn't disregard basic scientific fact and theory as blatantly as this movie does. Now, that may not matter to you. For me, when a film deals a lot with black holes and it's obvious that the screenwriters never even Googled the term 'black hole' to know what they were writing about, it's aggravating.This movie also has probably the single least interesting villain in the history of Star Trek on the big screen. The Klingons from The Search for Spock were better than Captain Nero (Eric Bana). Heck, even the stretchy-faced guys from Insurrection were more compelling. It's not Bana's fault. He can certainly act and he emotes as much as he can, but there's just nothing to his character.I also have to make the same complaint about Star Trek that I make about many contemporary action movies. The fight scenes are frequently indecipherable. It's like someone took the footage and edited it together by throwing it in a blender and pushing 'puree'. Everything happens so quickly and the camera is so close in on the action that I can only get a vague impression of who's shooting who or who's punching who in the face. Maybe I'm just getting old and the kids today with their iPhones and their Facebooks and their Twitter can follow this stuff. I mostly can't.This is also a pretty weird looking film, if you pay attention to it. For example, some of the areas inside the Enterprise look like the 23rd century while others look like a brewery or the floor of a factory. I mean, there's almost always some creative license when it comes to the interior of a space ship in the movies, but the insides of this Enterprise don't make a lick of sense.As for the Star Trek Muppet Babies experience? Jeffrey Quinto and Anton Yelchin are passable versions of Spock and Chekov. John Cho's a fairly generic Sulu. Zoe Saldana is extremely hot and gets more to say as Uhura than the character usually has. Simon Pegg seems to play Scotty as a funny slacker. Chris Pine is charismatic as Jim Kirk but there's really not much Kirk-like about his character. I realize you probably don't want to watch a 20something actor do a William Shatner impersonation for two hours, but this Jim Kirk could have been a character from any of a hundred outer space movies. In fact, Karl Urban gives the hands down best performance as Leonard 'Bones' McCoy and that's largely by doing a DeForest Kelly impersonation.Star Trek is an entertaining film. I don't want to take that away from it. But the acid test for any Star Trek story isdoes the underlying story stand up if you remove any Trek connection from it? This movie fails that test. It's nowhere near the level of The Wrath of Khan or The Voyage Home. Its enthusiasm and the new look and feel it brings to Trek, however, definitely raises it above crap like Nemesis or Generations.While adventure has always been a big part of any good Star Trek, it's always been about more than just shooting people with phasers or beaming people out of ships seconds before they crash. At its best, Star Trek has always grappled with issues of the human condition. This movie doesn't do that. But if it can breathe new life into a franchise that was driven into the ground through incompetence and a tragic lack of imagination, that's quite an achievement in its own right.",6,2,5,26 September 2010
Inglourious Basterds," Tragically, this is probably as good as Taratino will ever again be
","Inglorious Basterds is a bit of a mixed bag. It demonstrates that Quentin Taratino hasn't completely lost it as a filmmaker, but it also indicates that we'll probably never get any more truly great work out of him.Theoretically, this story is supposed to be based on a team of Jewish-American soldiers during World War II who were sent into occupied France to fight the Nazis. It's pretty clear that Tarantino lost interest in that idea at some point, so he throws in a remedial primer on the early 20th century German film industry, inserts an extraordinarily charismatic Nazi, adds in some of his 'I love the 70s' stylistic flourishes and wraps it all up with a crude and oddly-timed Jewish revenge fantasy.The first thing to know about this movie is that it's fairly talky, even by Tarantino standards. He's coming awfully close here to doing with dialog what Michael Bay does with explosions. Virtually every dialog scene goes on too long, to the point where it's obvious that Taratino's just dragging things out for his own amusement. I know a lot of people love Tarantino's dialog and the fact that much of it is in French or German helps to disguise how a decent portion of it is as aimless and meandering as what he did in Death Proof, but that doesn't change the fact that most of the conversation scenes in this movie would have greatly benefited from a little editing.The second thing to know about Inglorious Basterds is that it has some spectacular performances. Christoph Waltz is brilliant as the complexly civilized Jew hunter, Colonel Hans Landa. He does some genuinely Oscar-worthy acting up until the end of the film, when the script rips the character away from him and makes Landa a servant of the Almighty Plot Hammer. Diane Kruger is also very good as a German movie star working for the British and Michael Fassbender is the epitome of English charm as a British soldier who used to be a film critic. Til Schweiger gives a small but compelling performance as a German Nazi-killer as well and Daniel Bruhl as a German war hero is surprisingly human, again right up until the scripts rips the character away from him.Though he's the titular star of Inglorious Basterds, Brad Pitt does not do a good job as backwoods leader of the Jewish-American soldiers. He's like a stand up comedian on open mic night who tells the same joke over and over and over and over. Some folks might find that ironically funny and I don't think Tarantino wanted anything else from Pitt, but it's just not good. Mike Myers also embarrasses himself in a small role where he looks like he's playing a character from a fourth Austin Powers movie.The third thing to know about this film is that Tarantino is again playing around with story structure. He's not doing the whole non-linear thing again, thank goodness, but it appears as though he only wrote individual scenes and then stretched them out as far as he could. He largely dispensed with the connective tissue of the story so he could focus on what he thinks is 'the good stuff'. The problem is those little moments in between the big moments are often where the story gets a lot of its depth and where the big moments get a lot of their power. By cutting away all those little moments, Tarantino leaves us with a story and characters that are far too shallow.The final thing to know about Inglorious Basterds is that there's a tin-eared quality to its emotional resonance. This is a revenge fantasy about murdering Hitler and while there's never a bad time to killer Hitler, doing such a film might have made sense in 1950, 1960 or 1970. Making such a movie in 2009 is sort of fetishy. The story is built on a visceral hatred that Tarantino and his actors don't actually feel, because it's almost impossible to viscerally hate someone who died several decades before you were born. Someone who viscerally hates Hitler, like Mel Brooks for example, would have been driven by that hatred to make a film that was either much darker or much funnier. Inglorious Basterds always seems alienated from the very emotions at the core of its story.If you thought Kill Bill and Death Proof were great, you'll think Inglorious Basterds is a masterpiece. It's much better than those two movies. But if you recognized the flaws in those films, you'll be able to see the problems in this one. There is a lot to enjoy here; the acting, the dialog before it tests your patience, a more restrained example of Tarantino's flair for cinematic violence. The problem is that there will probably always be something to enjoy in Taratino's work. But his last three movies (Kill Bill counts as one) all have obvious, significant weaknesses. With Inglorious Basterds, I'd say the good outweighs the bad, but the bad is still there. I don't know if no one will tell Tarantino when there's a problem with a film, if he won't listen or it he isn't willing to work hard enough to fix it.Granted, Tarantino has already made more great movies than most filmmakers do in the entire careers, but it's frustrating to think he'll never make anything that good again.",6,2,4,23 July 2010
Iron Man 2," Funny and action-packed, but lacks depth
","IRON MAN 2 2010Written by Justin Theroux. Directed by Jon Favreau. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Clark Gregg, John Slattery, Jon Favreau, Paul Bettany, Leslie Bibb and Garry Shandling.Ol' Shellhead and company return in another blockbuster to kick off the summer movie season and they more than prove the first Iron Man was no fluke. Palladium-powered by excellent performances, great action sequences and a funny, fast-paced script, Iron Man 2 rockets into the pantheon of best super-hero movies ever.The story begins with billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) seemingly at the top of the world. He's fulfilling his father's dreams of a better tomorrow by hosting a year long technology expo and batting aside the demands of a smarmy U.S. Senator (Garry Shandling) that Stark surrender his amazing armor to the government. Claiming the rest of the world is years away from creating anything like Iron Man, Stark arrogantly and entertainingly presents himself as the man who has privatized world peace and says he's capable of handling any problem that arises on his own.That's more boast than fact. Stark is actually being slowly poisoned by the Palladium in the energy generator in his chest and hasn't found a way to prevent his own death. He's attacked and nearly killed by mysterious Russian Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), who's proved Stark wrong by building an energy whip harness obviously similar to the Iron Man armor. Weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) also buzzes about Stark like a bothersome gnat and while completely overmatched by Tony, Hammer proves to be the fulcrum upon which Vanko's ultimate vengeance will turn.Stark isn't alone to face these threats. He's joined by his loyal and frequently bemused assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), his faithful bodyguard/chauffeur Happy Hogan (Jon Favreau) and Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), a young woman from Stark Industries legal department who proves to be a whole lot more than meets the eyewhich is saying a lot when you look like Scarlett Johannson. Air Force Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) gets a chance to don his own armored battlesuit and the magnetic director of SHIELD Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) turns up to offer Stark his one and only chance to save his life and stop the technological arms race he started from spinning out of control.There is one legitimate criticism you can make of Iron Man 2. While it's more action-packed and a bit funnier than it's predecessor, it lacks the same dramatic depth. At the heart of the first film was a well developed story of an immature and self-centered man learning to grow up and accept his responsibility to the rest of the world. Iron Man 2 doesn't really have that sort of simple humanity at its core, though it does dabble a bit in Tony Stark's complicated relationship with his father. This movie is more bloodless, focusing on standard blockbuster plot mechanics and witty banter.While not as narratively vital, Iron Man 2 is still an excellent film. Downey Jr. and Paltrow are just as engaging. Rockwell, Rourke and Shandling are perfectly comedic and menacing as the movie requires. Cheadle joins the fray as a man torn between his friend and his country. Johannson doesn't get to do much more than look good and kick ass, but she does each exceptionally well. The special effects are first rate. The script has more laughs than most straight forward comedies. And director Favreau deserves a lot of credit for keeping an awful lot of balls in the air and never letting the movie sputter or sag.Iron Man 2 is exciting, clever and a whole lot of fun. If you liked the first, you should definitely see the second and that's about all you can ask for from a sequel.",7,1,3,7 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Segel deserves an award just for not giving himself all the best lines in this thing
","This is a funny movie about the cruelty of human relationships that succeeds by taking a very democratic approach to comedy.Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) seems like a lucky guy. He's got a great job creating the theme music for a TV show and is dating the ultra-hot star of that show, Sarah Marshall (Kristin Bell). The fact that Peter is a fat shlub who sits around his apartment wearing sweatpants and eating cereal out of big steel mixing bowl makes their romance all the more remarkable. That's why it's not that surprising when Sarah tells Peter she's met someone else and it's over. That sends Peter into a spiral of self-loathing and awkward sexual encounters, which the ineffectual advice of his step-brother Brian (Bill Hader) does little to counteract.Eventually, Peter decides he's got to get away from it all and heads to Hawaii. Just as he's trying to get a room at the hotel, Sarah shows up with her new boyfriend, rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). A pretty hotel employee named Rachel Jansen (Mila Kunis) rescues Peter from dying of embarrassment by letting him stay in the hotel's best suite. Rather than run home like any sane person would, Peter decides to say and be tortured by the sight and presence of Sarah. He barely gets through it with the help of some hotel employees and the terrible example of a newlywed couple who act like they barely know each other. Peter eventually asks Rachel out and discovers that there can be romance after Sarah Marshall only to finally realize that Sarah had good reasons to break up with him, reasons that might cost him any chance he has with Rachel.As I said, this is a funny movie. However, a lot of movies try to be funny, many of them very similar to Forgetting Sarah Marshall in style and attitude. Most of them aren't. The difference is that this film has an actual point and it's not the one you'd expect. The point of this story isn't that Peter has to realize what a horrible shrew Sarah is and learn that he deserves better in life. Sarah's actually portrayed as a fairly decent girl in this film, if a bit self-centered. No, the real villain of this movie isPeter. I t's his passivity, immaturity and refusal to act like a grown-up that's the real problem and it's one that would sabotage his relationship with Rachel as surely as it did with Sarah. The challenge that Peter has to overcome isn't Sarah, it's himself.This script brings that level of sophistication to just about every thing. Sarah's new boyfriend would have been nothing but a raging douchebag in a lesser film. Here, he has a personal integrity and genuine human emotions that make him likable. Aldous isn't just an obstacle for Peter to overcome or a target for the audience to hate. He's a person playing his own role in this interpersonal dynamic.Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a sex comedy and it's pretty raunchy. However, the sex humor is remarkably non-exploitative and it can even get a laugh out of something as simple a guy unbuttoning the top button of his shirt. Writer/star Jason Segel also deserves credit for not giving himself all the best lines. Peter is the butt of the joke more often than not. Segel also engages in some full frontal nudity, which I'm not sure he should get credit for.It's hard to describe a comedy by saying much more than 'it's funny'. So many comedies aren't, though, that you don't get to say it that often. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is funny. What more can I say?",7,0,2,21 April 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," So, is this reboot ever going to have a purpose other than making money?
","I thought JJ Abrams' initial reboot of the franchise was fresh, exciting and not really much of a Star Trek movie. Into Darkness is still moderately exciting and slightly more Trekish, though more of the DS9 and Voyager variety than either Classic or Next Gen, but the freshness of Abrams' take expires long before this film is over. The story swaps out stunning scientific illiteracy for a senselessly elaborate plot that feels more like an overstuffed episode of Alias. The interior of the new Enterprise continues to make less sense than the TARDIS. And while the rest of the cast comes a bit closer to matching Karl Urban's great imitation of DeForest Kelley, the fact remains that the only reason any cares about Kirk is William Shatner, the only reason anyone cares about Spock is Leonard Nimoy and the only reason anyone cares about this motion picture is Gene Roddenberry.Into Darkness stays true to the fanfic alt-history approach of Abrams and mashes up the first re-appearances of both Khan and the Klingons with a 'lessons of 9/11' message that would have been bold 10 years ago but is now positively moldy, especially given that it follows the similarly 'lessons of 9/11' themed Iron Man 3. There's a whole lot of running around, some decent action and comedy bits and Alice Eve joins the cast, which is good enough to raise anything at least one star on the ratings scale.Remember when fans of the John Carter movie got all defensive over how badly it bombed at the box office? I remember because I was one of those fans and Star Trek: Into Darkness is a great example of why we tried to make so many excuses. This film isn't substantially better than John Carter. It inarguably isn't so much better that is deserves to make a couple hundred million dollars more in ticket sales. The power of the Trek brand, however, will get people into the theater and Abrams provides an adequate diversion for a couple of hours. If Disney hadn't almost entirely abandoned John Carter to the whims of fate, a sequel to that might have been just as unavoidable as this one.There are a host of 'Wait...what?' moments in this movie. Let me focus on just two of them. Wrath of Khan brilliantly handled the problem of how to credibly defeat an enemy who is smarter than you through the insight that intelligence is not the same as knowledge or wisdom. Classic Kirk and Spock whupped Khan's butt by taking advantage of his inexperience and emotional immaturity. Muppet Babies Spock is victorious because Muppet Babies Khan is an idiot who falls for a pretty obvious trick. And during Into Darkness' most notorious echoing of Star Trek II, can anyone explain what lesson is being learned and who is learning it? I don't think we need to get into the films' respective 'KHAAAAAAN' screams and how Wrath's made perfect dramatic sense while Abrams' version is melodramatic tripe.I am surely being too critical of this thing. Judged on the awesomely low standards of summer blockbusters, it's definitely above average. I'd just like to know when this rebooted franchise is going to offer something more than Roddenberry's reheated leftovers.",5,18,30,18 May 2013
Public Enemies," Hint - It's generally a good idea to figure out what your movie is about BEFORE you start production.
","This summer blockbuster is really a little film that never decided what it wanted to be when it grew up.Johnny Depp plays Depression-era bank robber John Dillinger, the man whose wide ranging crime spree across the Midwest made him public enemy #1 of the newly created Federal Bureau of Investigation. Dillinger was the most famous of a generation of outlaws who used the new technologies of fast cars and faster guns to recreate the Wild West in the 20st century heartland. Christian Bale plays Melvin Purvis, the FBI agent obsessed with capturing Dillinger dead or alive. Marion Cotillard plays Billie Frechette, the poor Chicago girl Dillinger falls in love with at first sight, promising to whisk her away to a life of excitement and adventure.Public Enemies starts out strongly, with Dillinger staging a bold prison break to free his gang but the story wanders into the wilderness after that and never makes it back to the main trail. It drops us into the midst of Dillinger's bank robbery career without preparation or explanation, immediately launches the FBI into the mix, throws in Dillinger's relationship with Billie, adds a bit of the uneasy union between the Dillinger gang and the organized crime in Chicago that was coalescing out of post-Prohibition, spices things up with fairly blatant yet surprisingly vague allusions to the socioeconomic dynamics of that age, tosses in a splash of anthropological theorizing about the rise of institutions crowding out the individual act and even stirs in some garden variety treachery and betrayal. The film is always going in so many directions that it never ends up anywhere.For example, both Billie Frechette and Melvin Purvis and the FBI are major elements of the movie from the very start through to the end. Yet, while Billie may have been important to John Dillinger the man, she's irrelevant to his story. She doesn't really play a major role in anything that happens to him and could be lifted out of the film entirely without losing much. Likewise, Purvis and the FBI aren't much of a factor until the later stages of Dillinger's criminal career, yet this film highlights them like they were breathing down Dillinger's neck all the time. So, for the first three-quarters of the movie, the FBI stands around talking about Dillinger but never accomplishes anything. Much of that last quarter of the film is also devoted to the idea that organized crime is growing and pushing out flamboyant outlaws like Dillinger, but while that may be an interesting point of discussion, it contributes very little dramatically.Public Enemies tries to focus on Dillinger the man, the myth, the popular phenomenon, the historical symbol and the cultural linchpin all equally. The result is a story that never gives you enough in any of those categories. It's like the filmmakers never decided if this was a period drama, a biography, a social commentary or even whether it was a summer blockbuster or some small independent flick. So while they've got a lot of interesting parts, they never build anything with them.I think the core of this movie was supposed to be the contrast of Purvis and Dillinger, not as good vs. evil but as competing societal forces. Dillinger was supposed to be freedom and personal power but also selfishness, irresponsibility and barbarism. Purvis was supposed to represent justice and order, but also oppression and control. I think the story was meant to be about how America in the 1930s was starting to shift from a Dillinger world to a Purvis civilization and how that was a mix of good and bad. But these filmmakers either gave up on that idea or added in so much nonessential stuff that it got lost.Director Michael Mann also made extensive use of hand held digital cameras in making this film, so in many respects it looks more like something on TV than a big screen film. On the one hand, that gives some of the more traditionally shot scenes a strong sense of realism. On the other hand, some scenes look like they were filmed by a local TV news camera crew. And not one from the good station in town, but from that 3rd place station nobody watches.There are a lot of individual moments in Public Enemies that are entertaining, however you can't say that about the entire movie. If you're willing to indulge this film's faults, you'll probably enjoy it. If you're more demanding than that, you'll probably be disappointed.",5,1,1,7 October 2010
The Other Boleyn Girl," A fine example of a movie that's good, not great.
","This soapy melodrama won't make anyone forget A Man for All Seasons or Anne of The Thousand Days, but it's well made, quite watchable and brings a new perspective to the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.That story should be familiar to most people. The king of England and his Spanish queen Katherine could not have a son. Tormented by his lack of a heir and what that would mean to the future of his kingdom, Henry fell under the spell of a young woman named Anne Boleyn. Unlike his other extramarital conquests, Anne refused Henry's affections until he was so consumed with lust for her that Henry cast off the Catholic Church and founded his own Church of England so he could divorce Katherine and marry Anne. But while her brains and her ambition made her queen of England, Anne's body betrayed her. She could not give Henry a son and learned that once Henry VIII got in the habit of replacing wives, it was hard for him to stop.What this film brings to the tale is the fact that Anne wasn't the only Boleyn girl that caught Henry's eye. She had a sister named Mary and this movie supposes that it is she who first enchanted and bedded the king, even giving him a bastard son, before Anne was finally able to sink her claws into Henry.The Other Boleyn Girl also emphasizes some of the brutal, practical realities of King Henry's English society, a world where grasping men sacrifice their wives and their children in their schemes for power and fortune. It is also a world where women, even the most capable or powerful, live with a pervasive oppression. They had no standing or rights that couldn't be taken away from them by their father or their husband.The best things about this movie are, quite appropriately, Natalie Portman as Anne and Scarlett Johansson as her sister Mary. Portman handles her more flamboyant role with aplomb, combining fury, cunning and fragility in equal measures. Johansson gives a dignity and purity to the simpler, more ordinary and yet stronger Boleyn sister. David Morrissey is almost as good as the cold and calculating Duke of Norfolk, who is the first one to propose tempting Henry with Anne. Mark Rylance is also wonderful at portraying the pitiful weakness of Anne and Mary's father, while Kristin Scott Thomas as their mother and Ana Torrent as Queen Katherine are perfect as strong women bound down by the social order of their day. Eric Bana does everything he can with a poorly written Henry VIII. It's like these filmmakers never knew what to make of the English king, so the character just sort of alternates between being consumed by lust, vexed by fears for the future, yearning for normality and driven by unyielding pride. Bana pulls it all off well, but it doesn't add up to a complete and believable person.Now, the film does take more than a few historical liberties and the direction of Justin Chadwick is never comfortable with the pomp and pageantry of a royal court. The story might also have benefited from being more focused and a little less ambitious, which is more of a backhanded compliment than a criticism. Dispensing with the melodramatic soap opera and concentrating on the gender and social mores that pushed women like Anne and Mary to do and consent to terrible things might have produced a much sharper and more provocative movie.But you can't fault a good film for not being great. I like The Other Boleyn Girl and recommend it as a period piece that brings just enough modern sensibility to one of the great stories in history, breathing a little new life into the old yarn.",6,1,1,16 June 2011
Superbad," Definitely not super good
","This is an intermittently amusing teenage sex comedy that never knows when enough is enough. There are some genuine laughs here, but it's so long and so scattered and so over-the-top that it simply wears out its welcome.Ostensibly the story of two high school friends faced with separation as they finish their senior years and will be attending different colleges in the fall, Superbad is really just a rising tide of dirty words, disgusting humor and awkward situations. Seth (Jonah Hill) is the fat friend who talks like he knows what's going on but lacks all but the most basic social skills. Evan (Michael Cera) is the quieter, nerdier friend who can safely interact with others but lacks the confidence to do so. When they're asked to get the booze for a big house party, Seth sees it as their chance to finally get laid and drags Evan along with him. They enlist the help of a third-wheel friend named Fogell (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and his bizarrely bad fake id to get the liquor but just about everything goes wrong that can go wrong, leading to two strange odysseys involving menstrual blood, property damage and sexual lubricant.As I mentioned, this film pretends to be about how to inseparable friends have to face up the finally standing on their own in the world. Every so often the movie literally stops and has the characters explain this alleged theme to the audience. Honestly though, it's all just an excuse for bad language and bad behavior. If these filmmakers were actually interesting in telling this story, they wouldn't spend an enormous amount of screen time on a wish-fulfillment digression where uber-dork Fogell falls in with two cops (Seth Rogen and Bill Hader) who act like bad improv comedians moonlighting as police officers.However, if you like obscenities and outrageous acts, you'll find enough in Superbad to choke a horse. This is one of those films where its creative profanity and 'I can't believe they did that' attitude is the main drawing point. I'll admit I laughed several times at that stuff, but after a while it got old and there's nothing else here to keep your interest.Superbad would be a great movie to show during a party where everyone has a little bit of a buzz on and no one watches it for more than a few minutes before doing something else. Sitting through the whole thing sober is not that satisfying an experience.",5,2,5,14 October 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Not a great story, but perhaps the greatest story that was never meant to be told
","The problem with making a film about the origin of the mutant super-hero Wolverine is that he was never meant to have an origin. He was created as a throwaway character for an issue of The Incredible Hulk, then got picked up as a supporting character for the revamping of the X-Men. No one really thought he was important enough to have his own origin, but he became one of the most popular comic book characters of the last 30 years. That led to a series of attempts to graft a powerful and moving beginning onto a character that was only intended to be a badass with a cool gimmick. But instead of a simple but profound start like 'Strange visitor from another planet' or 'With great power comes great responsibility', Wolverine got an origin that became increasingly convoluted and overwrought as more and more was added to it over time. That's reflected in this movie, which actually crams at least three distinct origin tales into 107 minutes. Throw in the traditional 'summer movie' buttload of explosions, gunfire and combat and there's not much room left for a good story.I mean, you know that scene where someone kneels over the body of a dead loved one and screams 'Nooooooooo!' to the heavens? This movie has two scenes like that. It has a shot of Wolverine walking into the camera as a huge explosion goes off behind him. There's a character who is clearly established as being a mass murderer, but then the film suddenly decides that being a mass murderer isn't that big a deal. Not to mention that this is the first time I've ever seen a movie literally stop and explain its own ending 15 minutes before it actually happens.Taking all in all, though, this isn't a bad film. The action sequences are all pretty good, the acting is better than you usually get for this sort of thing and while the story is kind of a mess, it makes enough sense that you're not left sitting in the theater thinking that every character in the movie is an idiot.In fact, this is the rare action movie where the acting is probably the best thing about it. Ryan Renolds and Kevin Durand are legitimately funny as mutants Deadpool and The Blob. Hugh Jackman is okay, though you can tell he works a lot better with someone to play off of than he does on his own. Danny Huston as William Stryker and Liev Schreiber and Sabretooth give probably the best performances of the film. It's not always easy to play a younger version of a character already portrayed by a fine actor, but Huston makes Stryker just similar enough to the man from X-Men 2 and is able to give him a little more depth. Schreiber brings real emotion and a sense of legitimacy his furry mutant. His Sabretooth isn't just a prop for Wolverine's story, but a living, breathing character in his own right.X-Men Origins: Wolverine tells a story that was never meant to be told. It doesn't do it very well, but that it can do it at all without being a total disaster is something of an achievement. This movie doesn't have a personal element that ever rises above the cliché and it has none of the broader moral or societal points that were found in the X-trilogy itself. This is just a big, dumb, fun 'summer movie' and I suppose there's nothing wrong with that.",6,3,6,18 June 2010
Just Go with It," Seriously, you have to just go with it.
","Like a lot of Adam Sandler comedies, Just Go With It manages to be very funny without actually being all that good. With a gossamer thin premise that even the film itself admits doesn't withstand any scrutiny, this movie throws more jokes at you in 30 seconds than many alleged comedies will have in 10 minutes and there are far more hits than misses. It's sort of like a good episode of Family Guy that just overwhelms you with silliness and naughtiness, as opposed to a bad episode of Family Guy where you're struck by how empty and arbitrary it all is.Danny Maccabee (Adam Sandler) is a plastic surgeon who got his heart broken by his fiancée as a young man, only to discover that wearing a wedding ring is like catnip to a certain breed of female. With a gold band as his ultimate wingman, Danny has been boinking and running for 20 years. Now, he thinks he's fallen in genuine love with Palmer (Brooklyn Decker), a 23 year old school teacher with the mind of an angel and a body made for sin. But when she finds Danny's ring, he can't exactly tell her he's been a deceitful pig with so many women. That's when Kathryn Murphy (Jennifer Aniston), his best friend and office assistant ,comes up with the idea of Danny inventing a fake wife he's divorcing as an explanation.But when Palmer demands to meet his wife, Danny has to rope Kathryn into playing the part. Then another lie gets her two kids (Bailee Madison and Griffin Gluck) involved, more deceit sends then all to Hawaii with Danny's horny dork of a cousin (Nick Swardson) in tow and then some additional deceit results in Kathryn needing Danny to pose as her husband. Would you be surprised to learn that playing husband and wife gradually makes Danny and Kathryn realize how much they care about each other, only for Palmer to then finally ask Danny to marry her? I didn't think so, though you might be surprised at the relatively unclichéd way it all turns out.Let me be frank. Does this story make you believe that a middle-aged guy who looks like Adam Sandler and a 20something girl who looks like Brooklyn Decker would fall in love? No. Does it convince you that Danny and Kathryn are soulmates? Not really. Does anything here resemble stuff that could happen in real life. Hardly.I don't think any of that matters because Just Go With It is pretty gosh darn funny. From nut shots and butt humor to ridiculous accents and plastic surgery sight gags to dead pan kids and somebody dropping the bionic elbow on a sick sheep, this film throws everything in the comedy kitchen at you, including a sink full of old women in grass skirts and coconut shell brassieres. If you've ever enjoyed a Sandler comedy, you'll probably laugh your behind off at this one even though Sandler is playing a relative adult who doesn't have a severe emotional or psychological problem. Jennifer Aniston also proves that her years on Friends weren't a fluke and holds her own on screen. She also demonstrates all the tabloid stories about her are bunk because there's no way the woman from those articles would have the self-confidence to go bikini vs. bikini against the amazingly proportioned Decker.This is a movie where its title is also the advice you have to give to any potential viewer. If you get wrapped up in everything that's not right with this film, you'll have a terrible time. But if you just go with it, you'll have a lot of fun.",6,2,5,14 February 2011
Terminator Salvation," It's the aging Michael Corleone of Terminator films
","This movie is the Godfather III of the Terminator franchise. Judged on its own merits, it's really not THAT bad for a summer action movie. Compared to the previous films, even the fairly weak Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, it bites the big one.Set after the artificial intelligence Skynet has destroyed most of mankind in a nuclear attack, you can tell right away that Terminator Salvation is going to be one of those movies you can't think about too hard. For example, you can't think about why there was no radioactive fallout left behind from Skynet's nuclear attack. Apparently these filmmakers never cracked a book on the actual affects of an atomic explosion. And that sort of thing, the complete disregard of logic, physics and causality, just gets worse and worse as the story goes along.Now, you'd guess that after three movies leading up to it, the story of John Connor (Christian Bale) leading the human resistance against genocidal robots would have been the plot of this film. For some inexplicable reason, it's not. John Connor is barely more than a supporting character in Terminator Salvation. The main character in the movie is really Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington). Wright is a death row prisoner who, before Skynet's attack, donated his body to science. About a decade and a half after his execution, he crawls out of the remains of a destroyed Skynet base looking perfectly fine and with no memory of how he ended up in this dystopic future. The first half of the movie is mostly about Wright wandering around nuclear devastated Southern California, meeting Kyle Reece (Anton Yelchin), the guy who gets sent back in time in the first Terminator movie, and a human resistance fighter named Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood). While that's going on, we get a bunch of exposition scenes with John Connor butting heads with the leaders of the resistance movement and what Edmund Blackadder would call a 'cunning plan' to defeat Skynet.Eventually, Wright and Connor meet and we discover the secret of Wright's reappearance. Since this is a Terminator movie, you can probably guess what that secret is even if you haven't seen the film. Wright and Connor then team up to rescue Reece, who's been taken prisoner by Skynet. That rescue involves pretty much every action movie cliché you can think of, including the old 'it was a trap all along' and 'the villain now explains the entire plan to the hero'. Then the movie ends by re-emphasizing that this story was really about Marcus Wright and that the whole purpose of Terminator Salvation was to perpetuate the franchise and take more of your money.This is, by far, the worst Terminator movie yet and proves that the whole thing should have never gotten beyond the first two films. The Terminator presented a black view of humanity that would lead us to destruction. Terminator II: Judgment Day saved us from that future and argued that humanity was worth saving. The story should have ended there, something proved when the third film could only justify its existence by totally contradicting the point of Terminator II. Now we have a fourth film that only exists to set the stage for even more Terminator movies to come. Hopefully, it bombed hard enough at the box office to spare us all from that fate.Christian Bale has little more to do in this film but stand around and yell. Bryce Dallas Howard, playing Connor's wife Kate, has nothing to do but stand around and be pregnant. Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood do a fine job, but nobody wants to go to a fourth Terminator film to watch characters they've never seen before. And Michael Biehn's Kyle Reece would have chewed up Anton Yelchin's version and crapped him out.Except for the ending battle, which is almost laughably ill-conceived, Terminator Salvation has some decent action scenes, a few interesting special effects and effectively mirrors moments from the previous films. That's it, though. There's no genuine human drama and the moral or societal theme of the story is childish and poorly thought out compared to first three movies. And though these filmmakers spent well over $150 million creating a post-apocalyptic future, James Cameron created a better and more compelling vision of that future over 30 years ago with just a few lines of dialog and the equivalent of $150 worth of special effects.I'm sure when Cameron and company came up with the first two Terminator films, they wanted to make money. But they were driven to tell interesting and meaningful stories. The last two Terminator films were created just to make money and whether they were any good was, at best, a secondary concern. I think we'd all be better off if this franchise was put out of its and our misery.",4,4,8,3 June 2010
500 Days of Summer," The moral of this story - Stop blaming your ex-girlfriend!
","This movie is a black comedy where all the darkness has been sucked out and replaced with a creamy filling of Zooey Deschanel. It's a brutally heartbreaking tale told with whimsy and wry appreciation.One of those stories where the guy acts like the girl and the girl acts like the guy, (500) Days of Summer is about all the time Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) found himself in love with Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). He's a failed architect who now makes a living writing greeting cards. She's cute and smart and quirky and seems like the perfect girl Tom has been waiting his whole life to love. The problem is Summer hasn't been waiting her whole life to love anyone, especially Tom. She tells Tom up front that she doesn't believe in love and isn't interested in anything serious. As the movie jumps back and forth among the end, beginning and middle of their relationship, we see what happens when one person thinks they've found their soulmate and the other just thinks they've found a buddy. When Summer tires of indulging Tom's romantic pretensions, he's crushed flatter than a piece of chewing gum run over by the bulls of Pamplona and it's not at all clear if the story's going to end with Tom getting over Summer, getting her back or killing himself.If you've ever been in one of those 'I love you more than you love me' relationships, you know how painful they cab be. Watching that sort of thing in this movie, however, is a very pleasant experience. Part of that is the delightful Miss Deschanel. Most of it comes from these filmmakers recognizing that the bad guy in this story isn't Summer, it's Tom. (500) Days of Summer isn't about a good guy who gets his heart stomped on by some unfeeling bitch. This is about a guy who still clings to immature fantasies about love and his life and what it finally takes for him to grow up. You could think of this film as a less contrived and more relaxed version of Forgetting Sarah Marshall where the humor comes from understanding how many of Tom's problems are his own doing.Miss Deschanel is lovely as the somewhat opaque Summer. We never get to see inside her character, but that's kind of the point. Tom never really sees her either, just how the idea of her fits in with his fantasy of love. Joseph Gordon-Levitt also excels in a tougher role than you'd expect. He never really gets to play the sympathetic victim because Tom isn't that sympathetic. While it shows Summer being a bit emotionally insensitive, the story never wavers from Tom's own responsibility for his situation.With some comic relief from Tom's friends and his little sister, a great dance number and a nice soundtrack, (500) Days of Summer is a sweet little confection of a film. It does end on a moral that doesn't fit the rest of the story and it is very lightweight, but if you're looking for something to help you realize that maybe that old girlfriend isn't actually to blame for your life falling apart, I believe you'll quite enjoy it.",7,1,2,17 September 2010
The Terminator," James Cameron should probably be more proud of this movie than anything else
","It's hard to review a real classic. What do you say about a movie that's not just a great piece of entertainment, but is significant in the history of film? The Terminator tells us the story of Sara Connor (Linda Hamilton), an ordinary young woman who works as a waitress and lives with a roommate, who learns she's to give birth to the savior of humanity. That's what she hears from Reece (Michael Biehn), a soldier sent back from a post-apocalyptic future where machines and men are at war. Reece was sent back to protect her from a killer cyborg (Arnold Schwarzenegger) that also traveled from the future to kill Sara and erase her son from existence before he could lead Mankind is a successful war against their mechanical enemies.When you say a movie is about a killer cyborg from the future and a main character who has to discover her inner hero, that doesn't necessarily sound like a classic, does it? It sounds just like another mediocre-at-best sci-fi melodrama, just like a couple dozen other forgettable B movies made every year that fill up the space between the really good films at the theater and on cable, another fancy premise used to tie together a bunch of explosions and special effects. But The Terminator is sooooo much more than that.Virtually everything in this movie is better than it has any reason to be. Though it has a clever idea, at its core The Terminator is a fairly basic adventure story. It's not inherently deep or complex or profound. There's no real social commentary to it or any examination of essential human conflicts. It's a chase movie. One with a genuinely clever angle, but still a chase movie. That sort of film doesn't necessarily demand superior writing, acting or directing but all of those things are present in The Terminator.I think the best way to demonstrate how good this movie is, is too simply take note of the little things done well in this film that you wouldn't see in lesser works. The casting of Linda Hamilton is one of those things. For the most important female character in the story, most films would usually cast an actress a lot more attractive than Hamilton. She's really only a bit prettier than the other women in the film and she's really not even as pretty as her co-star, Michael Biehn. But the story of Sara Connor is about a normal, unexceptional woman becoming the sort of person who changes human history. If Sara is a stunning beauty, it undermines the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary.Take a look at the two cops played by Paul Winfield and Lance Henriksen and the criminal psychologist played by Earl Boen. They're supporting characters whose purpose is to get the main characters from the first act into the third act. But even though they're not on screen for every long or have many lines, the actors make them into people just as real as Sara or Reece. And those three characters actually have some of the best and funniest lines of dialog in the whole movie.Consider the character of Reece. He has less than a handful of lines of dialog in the first third of the film, but we understand more about him than any other character through his actions and his memories. Or look at how the film handles the Inevitable Exposition Dump. In this sort of genre picture, whether it's sci-fi or horror or what have you, there's always a moment when some character has to explain what's going on to another character, and by extension to the audience. The Terminator has one of those scenes, but instead of it happening during a dead space when the story comes to a stop, most of it occurs in the middle of a car chase! You can also marvel as the visual sense Cameron brings to the entire film. From one of the earliest scenes where a naked Arnold Schwarzenegger stares down at nighttime Los Angeles to the final moment where Sara Connor drives down a lonely road as a storm approaches, Cameron is always reaching for something better than what you usually get from this sort of action flick.The Terminator didn't just help create one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood history. It's one of the foundations of the modern sci-fi action genre. It's one of those films that help you appreciate just how good movies can be. It's a classic.",8,3,5,3 June 2010
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," I don't even want to think about how bad Hellboy III will be
","This may be one of the worst sequels in the history of cinema where the writer and director of the first film is still involved in the production. Hellboy II has far more monsters and special effects than its predecessor, but it has less of everything that really matters. Less intelligence. Less style. Less drama. Less charm. Less heart. This amazingly ill conceived movie is even in a different genre than the original Hellboy. Imagine The Empire Strikes Back as a musical or Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom as a comedy.It is impossible for me to exaggerate how flawed and poorly executed this film is. In the first three minutes of the movie, it tells you how the story is going to end. Within the first 15 minutes, it tells you exactly how the bad guy is going to be defeated. The script takes a character from the first film and completely craps all over him, so it can replace him with a special effect that has such a pathetically stereotypical personality, it's something Mel Brooks would have come up with after he had three separate lobotomies. One of the basic concepts of the first movie is literally thrown out the window before the sequel is half over and then that change is forgotten about. The physical nature of one character is altered without any explanation. Dramatic plot threads are picked up and dropped like a thumbless juggler. And then there's the drunken monster karaoke, which believe me, is not as cool as it sounds.The plot (which again, is essentially spelled out for you in the first three minutes of the film) concerns the old gang from the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense squaring off against an elf prince who wants to use an ancient weapon to destroy humanity. Hellboy (Ron Perlman), the demon who just wants to be accepted, acts more like Buddy Hackett than a super-hero. His pyrokinetic girlfriend Liz (Selma Blair) is an afterthought caught in a storyline out of a exceptionally dumb soap opera. The aquatic Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) spends the entire movie behaving like Niles Crane around Daphne, even though he's no longer voiced by David Hyde Pierce. The elf prince (Luke Goss) acts like he wants to be a contestant on 'So You Think You Can Dance'. He's got a sister (Anna Walton) who sets back the cause of elven feminism by about a thousand years.The special effects and the hordes of creatures that populate this movie are nice to look at, but that's all. It's as if writer/director Guillermo Del Toro thought that as long as he made it visually interesting, no one would care that every other aspect of the film sucked ass. Sadly, he's right for some people.Hellboy II is so different in so many ways from Hellboy that if you hated the first film, you might actually like this one. That is, if you also have no taste, read at a kindergarten level and are hopped up on goofballs. Let me be blunt. This movie makes Men In Black II look like The Godfather, Part II. Avoid this thing like a hooker with sores on her upper lip.",3,7,12,20 August 2010
Cloverfield," The most fun I've had almost vomiting
","This movie almost made be vomit. So before I get into this movie, there's something I'd like to convey to any and all current and future filmmakers who might, by odd happenstance, read this review.ENOUGH WITH THE DAMN SHAKY-CAM!!! When the whole sliding, shifting, wandering camera shot first came into common use well over a decade ago, it was a neat innovation. It gave a documentary air of authenticity to fictional tales. It helped audiences think they were seeing something different than the stories they've seen before. However, shaky-cam doesn't do any of that any more. It is now just another cliché.You've probably heard Cloverfield described as 'The Blair Witch Project meets Godzilla'. It seems somewhat belittling to label a truly clever idea like that, but it is accurate. This is the story of a group of 20somethings with a video camera who are stuck in the middle when a giant monster invades New York City and the most important thing to know about the movie is that, outside of a few times when the camera calms down to give the audience a clear look at the special effects, Cloverfield is filmed like a drunk guy with a hand held video camera trying to shoot a wedding reception in the middle of a war.The image on the screen spins and shakes and tilts and weaves and it goes on and on and on. In the theater, I only lasted about 30 minutes before I had to walk out. If I hadn't left, I absolutely would have vomited on the person in front of me. I made it through the entire thing, watching the DVD at home, but I had an upset stomach and headache by the end. If you get at all motion sick, avoid Coverfield because it is worse than Blair Witch or any other film shot in this style.If you've got a stronger constitution, though, Cloverfield's a decent film. Beyond the basic concept, it's an utterly pedestrian monster moviebut the concept is strong enough to carry you through the entire 84 minutes. Yeah, it is pretty short but it fits with the pure roller coaster idea of the film. No one really wants to ride a 20 minute long roller coaster. It just becomes too much and I'm not sure Cloverfield would have been improved if they'd spent another 20 or 30 minutes trying to make the story better and the characters more interesting. Ironically, the more engaging the story was and the more you cared about the characters, the more you'd probably get annoyed and angered at the hand held video stuff getting in between you and the story.I do think the filmmakers missed the point of the giant monster genre, however. Giant monster movies are supposed to be fun, but this film embraces a post-9/11 understanding of urban catastrophe that is everything but fun. Watching a giant monster destroy a skyscraper is enjoyable as a mindless spectacle. Watching the traumatized survivors wander about in the rubble afterwards is not that pleasant. Cloverfield also doesn't seem to understand the significance of the giant movie monster. It's such a ridiculous concept that you need to ground it with some real world analogy, the nuclear bomb origins of Godzilla being the most well known, but even the King Kong films can be seen as metaphors for the folly of Man thinking he can control and master the natural world. The Cloverfield monster doesn't have any significance. It's the destructive aftermath of the colossal beast movie in which the movie is interested.The monster itself, when you finally see it, is kind of goofy. However, you sort of have to give the filmmakers a pass on that. By now, it's become incredibly difficult to create any sort of creature that doesn't look like something seen in a previous movie or TV show and anything 350 feet tall starts to look a little silly.Does Cloverfield live up to the hype? No. It doesn't set some bold, new standard for the monster movie, but it is a well-executed, clever idea. That definitely makes this a movie worth seeing, unless you're a easy puker.",6,0,1,13 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Admit it. You loved the Ewoks back in 1983.
","You know what the dirty little secret of Return of the Jedi is? The Ewoks don't suck.Wrapping up the trilogy, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and company head back to Tatooine to rescue Han Solo (Harrison Ford) from the clutches of space gangster Jabba the Hutt (Big Ass Puppet). After succeeding, they have to deal with the threat of the Empire building a new Death Star. That leads to a three-way final battle where Han and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) have to blow up the force field generator protecting the under-construction Death Star, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) leads the attack to blow it up and Luke engages both Darth Vader (David Prowse, James Earl Jones) and the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid) in moral combat for Luke's life and Vader's soul.Return is a great conclusion to the Star Wars trilogy, but it's not much more than that. Star Wars had the best story and the best character moments. Empire didn't expand much on them but did take them in a new direction and give them a different tone. Return doesn't do much more than wrap things up and taken on its own is probably the least complete Star Wars film of all, though it's still better written and acted than any of the prequels.Return gets criticized more than the first two films and I think we all know the reason why. Ewoks. The fact that the Star Wars saga ended with pint-sized alien teddy bears playing a major role in defeating the fearsome Empire drives some folks up the wall. To you people I sayget over it. I liked the Ewoks when the movie first came out. YOU liked the Ewoks when the movie first came out. There was an Ewok Celebration song playing on the radio back in the Summer of 1983 and I remember it winning the 'Best Song' contest for several weeks in a row on a local station. Widespread Ewok-hate is something that only developed years later, as the Star Wars audience aged, got a bit jaded from watching the films so many times and had to blame something for the fact that Return has some serious weaknesses as an individual film.The fact is the Ewoks really aren't offensive or irritating (See Binks, Jar Jar) and actually fit in with the overall message of the movie. Return is all about how evil can only be defeated by good people working together. Return casts evil as acting on your own for selfish, destructive ends. Good is people joining hand to resist that kind of self-directed power. In that light, the Rebels needing the help of primitive (and cute) aliens to win the day is perfectly in line with Return's story.I hadn't watch the original trilogy for a long time when I sat down to review them, and it's interesting how I didn't quite remember them exactly the way they are. For instance, Empire and Return do not logically flow from Star Wars. To some extent they go against many elements of the first film and you can see how the story could have legitimately gone in very different directions. I also had forgotten or not appreciated just how much Luke's story comes to dominate Empire and Return. He may be the hero of Star Wars, but many other characters play significant roles and have their own stories that unfold. But just compare Luke to Han and Leia. Over the course of the films, Luke grows from naïve young farm boy to almost otherworldly warrior-poet, and we get to see a lot of the evolution happen in front of us. Han, however, kind of devolves from the hardened, cynical, somewhat puffed up mercenary of the first film to a somewhat goofy, common man shlub who's mostly out of his depth but getting by on bravery and reckless stupidity. Leia is a tremendously strong character in Star Wars who is reduced to just Han's love interest in Empire, before getting to don a gold bikini and do a little bit more in Return. The truth is that Han and Leia don't have much in the way of stories in the later two films outside their romance, and that's largely sprung on the audience full grown.Star Wars is genuinely one of the best films in history. Empire isn't on that level as a film, but is a bold twist on a wildly popular story. Return wraps everything up in a satisfactory way, but is a pretty thin story on its own. If you really want to understand why the Star Wars prequels sucked so very, very hard, you only have to recognize that they are all much more like Return than they are like Empire or Star Wars.",7,0,4,10 October 2010
The Expendables," Lots of booms but no boobs
","This cartoonish combo platter of action stars from the last three decades blows stuff up real goodand that's almost all you can ask of something like this, isn't it?Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his right hand man Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) head up a mercenary band made up of predictably colorful characters named Ying Yang (Jet Li), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and the normally named but abnormally huge Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren). After saving a ship from some Somali pirates, Barney and company are hired to kill a geographically dubious dictator. General Garza (David Zayas) is styled like a Central American strongman, yet lords over a Caribbean-style island in the Gulf of Mexico.Barney and Christmas head to the island and check it out, where they meet Garza's daughter Sandra (Giselle Itie). She's sort of a cross between rebel leader and Nicole Richie. Sandra is captured by the evil ex-CIA agent (Eric Roberts) who is the power behind Garza's throne, leading Barney and company to storm the island and free her with a combination of mixed martial arts, bullets and a ludicrously unlimited supply of explosives. Assed are kicked. Bodies are blown apart. Stuff is set on fire. The bad guy gets the hell killed out of him in the end.The 80s action movie is one of the more maligned modern genres and The Expendables is a good reminder of why that is. It's all fairly dumb, unsophisticated and macho almost, but not quite, to the point of being homoerotic. When the punches and knives are flying; when Stallone is pretending to be the fastest gun on Earth; when Randy Couture and Steve Austin hook up in the ultimate UFC vs. WWE battle; basically anytime a good guy is doing something extremely violent to a bad guy, The Expendables is also fun. There's a way too long lull between the opening action sequence and when things finally get going on Garza's island and the quality of one-liners in the script is pretty bad, but The Expendables is a solid B as 80s action flicks go and gets bumped up to B+ for putting a bunch of genre legends on screen at the same time.There are a few things in this film I really don't understand. There's a scene that explains Couture's cauliflower ears and another where Li complains about being short that seem like inside jokes where I'm on the outside. I also can't figure out why Charisma Carpenter is in this film. She plays Lee Christmas' girlfriend and that role exists just to give Statham a little more screen time, but it doesn't make sense for that role to be played by a 40 year old actress who doesn't take her clothes off. Don't get me wrong. Carpenter is the personification of Milfy goodness, but I don't know why such a slight and mechanical part didn't go to some 20something babe who was willing to get nude.In fact, there are no naked chicks at all in The Expendables. Not even a gratuitous scene where somebody goes to a strip club. I really don't get the point of making a testosterone-fueled festival of violence without having a few chicks take their tops off. While it's true that nudity was more the province of 1980s horror movies than 80s action flicks, this is 2010 and a bare boob or two is the least this film could have given us.The reality of The Expendables isn't nearly as good as the idea of it. That reality is good enough to make this something all action fans, 80s variety or otherwise, should see.",7,3,9,23 August 2010
MASH," Arrogant irreverence is not the same as actually funny
","For a legendary comedy, MASH isn't that funny. It's mostly mean, petty, arrogant and self-righteous.As anyone familiar with the TV show spawned by this film knows, MASH is the story of 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War. It primarily follows the exploits of surgeons Hawkeye Pierce (Donald Sutherland) and Trapper John (Elliot Gould) as they joke their way through bloody surgery and dealing with Army bureaucracy. There's really not much of a plot to the film. It's just the characters moving from one situation to the next, mostly becoming more absurd as they go along.There aren't that much more than a handful of real jokes in the movie and most of them are the simplest sort of slapstick. Almost all of the alleged humor of MASH comes out of the characters' irreverent attitude toward each and every thing around them. But being irreverent isn't always the same as being funny. Sometimes being irreverent is just being a jackass and in the case of MASH, sometimes it's just being a cruel child lashing out at anyone different than you.My problem with this movie started with the scene where Hawkeye and his fellow newly arrived doctor, Duke (Tom Skerrit), encounter Major Frank Burns (Robert Duvall). As they enter their tent, they find Frank trying to teach a young Korean boy how to read, and he's using the Bible to do it. Hawkeye and Duke find this to be odd and somewhat offensive behavior and give the boy a girlie magazine to look at instead. Later on, Frank prays for the safety of U.S. soldiers in the field, their commanders on the ground and their Commander-In-Chief and again, Hawkeye and Duke find this behavior objectionable and openly mock and deride Frank for praying. And it's very clear that the movie wants us to agree that Frank's actions are strange, bad and laughable. But the movie never bothers to explain why.Trying to teach a Korean kid to read English is a noble thing, especially because the movie never implies that the kid has any real education to speak of and in contrast to the way the movie's 'heroes' treat him as nothing more than a servant. Praying for the well being of others should be about the most unobjectionable thing anyone can do, yet MASH implies it shouldn't be tolerated in polite company. Frank Burns is constantly treated like a terrible person, but Duvall's Frank isn't the complete weasel that Larry Linvile portrayed on TV. The only sin Duvall's Frank ever commits is being a little uptight. He never does anything any normal person would consider that bad, yet because he doesn't think and act the way Hawkeye and Trapper John do he's subjected to cruel torments and physical violence.It's even worse for Major Margaret O'Houlihan (Sally Kellerman). Again, her only real offense is being a little uptight. But she's repeatedly subjected to the most vicious sorts of humiliations and unlike Frank, who at least gets to strike back at his tormentors, 'Hot Lips' laps up the abuse like a whipped dog and later in the film grinningly pals around with the very people who treated her like the lowest form of garbage.I can only imagine that MASH was supposed to reflect the cultural attitudes of the day. Audiences were supposed to identify with Hawkeye and the gang as 'us' and laugh uproariously as they heaped abuse on 'them'. But if the narcissistic, crude, intolerant, vindictive, sadistic and awful thinking and attitudes embodied by this film really did represent the true face of the late1960s/early 1970sno one should be surprised that there are so many people who deeply despise that era and everything it stood for.",3,10,20,14 March 2014
Pan's Labyrinth," Perhaps too successful at what it's trying to do
","Pan's Labyrinth is too successful at what it tries to be. With this film Del Toro reimagines the Spanish Civil War as a fairy tale for adults, but he does it so well that it's hard for an adult audience to fully appreciate it.The story, like most good fairy tales, focuses on both good and evil. The good is Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl caught up in the messy days after the end of the Spanish Civil War. He father is dead and her mother (Ariadna Gil) has remarried to an officer in Franco's army. Now pregnant with the Captain's child, she and Ofelia travel to his military post, where he is leading the effort against a local guerrilla band in the surrounding hills. The evil of the story is the Captain (Sergi Lopez), representing the regimented, strict and unemotional nature of the fascist regime.Upon arriving at her new 'home', Ofelia is lead by a fairy into an ancient maze. There she encounters a faun, a gigantic, mostly wooden goat man who tells Ofelia that she is a princess of a magical kingdom who must perform three tasks to shed her mortal existence and rejoin the spirit realm. Those tasks, which include killing a giant toad and retrieving an item from a monster's lair, are interwoven with the struggle between the Captain and the rebels. Yet, that struggle is as much myth as Ofelia's encounter with a murderous creature who puts his eyeballs in his palms.The real world events of the film aren't based in any sort of social or personal realism. They could just as easily have been a 'Once upon a time' story about a cruel overlord and the courageous villagers who eventually destroy him. Like most fairy tales, evil is built up to be this overpowering forcebut then it is defeated, not because of clever planning or even acts of nobility or bravery. Evil is defeated through fairly base trickery and just because good is supposed to defeat evil.And like most fairy tales, the strongest and most compelling character is the bad guy. Ofelia is a lovely child who cares for her mother and her unborn brother, but there's not much depth or complexity to her. When she succeeds or fails, it's not because of some aspect of her character. It's just because it fits the story. But like the evil witch in Snow White, it is the Captain who is the most compelling figure of the story. He's a sadist who delights in tormenting prisoners, yet he's also a brave warrior on the battlefield. He does love Ofelia's mother, yet would gladly sacrifice her to save his unborn son to carry on his name. He deals out death casually, yet is haunted by his father's end and contemplates suicide. The Captain is supposed to be the real monster of the tale, yet at the end he's the most fully realized, most truly human character in the story.Del Toro is to be lauded for how well he recreates the classic fairy tale sensibility. Those stories we tell to children are shot through with cruelty and horror and suffering. They're also only weakly tethered to the world of logic and cause and effect, things happen in fairy tales that defy explanation and we accept them without question. But while that works with Ofelia's mystical journey, you may find yourself wanting more or feeling there's something missing in the struggle with the Captain. There is a whole sense of unreality to both story lines and moments when the 'real' world doesn't make sense as real. Which is, I'm sure, what Del Toro was trying to dobut the 'real' world is never real enough to provide enough contrast with Ofelia's fantasy world.The end of Pan's Labyrinth also aspires to be as dark and heartbreaking as many fairy tales. But after embracing unreality so thoroughly, the sharp turn back to normality is too much. You're asked to accept or consider something so out of touch with everything that comes before, that the emotions appealed to can't respond quickly enough. By the time you realize just how sad you should be, the movie's over.Pan's Labyrinth is visually stunning and true to the essence of all good fairy tales, but the mix of fantasy and reality may be too muddy for both kids and grown ups.",5,1,10,7 October 2010
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Seriously, how do you make Sweeney Todd and leave out 'The Ballad of Sweeney Todd'?
","If there's one thing that this movie proves beyond any doubt it is this â€“ you can't make a musical with people who can't really sing.Adapted from Stephen Sondheim's classic stage production, this film tells the story of Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp). A barber in London with a beautiful wife and baby girl, Barker is arrested on a trumped up charge and thrown out of the country by the evil Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman). Years later, he returns home to be told his wife is dead and his daughter has been raised as Turpin's ward. Consumed with revenge, Barker renames himself Sweeney Todd and plots the judge's murder. When his initial attempt on the judge's life fails, Todd launches into a spree of killings in his Fleet Street barber shop with the bodies of his victims becoming the daily food source for the meat pie shop of his downstairs neighbor, accomplice and admirer Mrs. Lovett (Helena Bonham Carter). Turpin intends to marry Todd's daughter, but Johanna (Jayne Wisener) falls in love with a young sailor, Anthony (Jamie Campbell Bower). Anthony conspires with Todd to free Johanna, but Todd wants to use them both to lure the judge back into his clutches.The first and most important thing to say about this movie is that most of the actors in it can't really sing. They're not horrible, like drunk secretaries during karaoke night at the local bar or those freaks who show up at American Idol auditions, but they don't have anything like the pipes you need for this sort of music. Their voices are thin and cramped and shallow. Take Johnny Depp for example. He has his own rock band and listening to him in this film, you can easily imagine him being able to pull off your typical rock song. But musical theater, especially when it's the quality of Sweeney Todd, is a whole 'nother level and requires a great deal more talent and skill. Going back to American Idol, hearing Depp and Carter try and warble their way through some of Sweeney's excellent tunes is like hearing those lesser contestants on Idol try and fake their way through styles of music they're unfamiliar with and don't particularly like. In the whole cast, only Ed Sanders and Jamie Campbell Bower show off legitimate musical theater chops.This film also commits one of the biggest and stupidest crimes in the history of big screen musical adaptations. It omits The Ballad of Sweeney Todd from the movie. It's simply one of the best songs in the whole show, and leaving it out is like doing Annie and leaving out 'Tomorrow'.Visually, this may be the least interesting film Tim Burton has ever done. He gives London and its citizens a cartoonishly Gothic look, but the camera work and the way he shoots the songs, especially, are very pedestrian for a Burton movie. T here are only two or three instances in the whole film, such as when the bodies of Sweeney's victims thud against the stone floor of Mrs. Lovett's baking room, that show Burton's unique vision at all. It's almost as though he was unsure how to shoot the musical scenes and a sort of directorial paralysis spread throughout the entire film. The most Burtony section of the movie is a day dream sequence while Mrs. Lovett sings 'By the sea', but the playful styling of that only emphasizes how ordinary everything else is.In fairness to Burton, though, adapting Sweeney Todd to the silver screen is a big challenge. It's much more operatic than other musicals, with the characters actually singing the story for the most part in place of dialog. The songs are so important to the story and so intricate, I think they work better coming out of the mouth of someone standing on a stage instead of competing with all the visual imagery blaring at you from the screen.Years ago, I saw a televised production of Sweeney Todd on Iowa Public Television starring Angela Lansbury and George Hearn. You might have to use the Google and go look for it on the Youtube or the eBay, but that fabulous production far outstrips this weak 2007 effort.",4,1,2,13 October 2010
The Town," Affleck goes to Town and finds his career
","Ben Affleck continues to resurrect his career with an excellent film that combines working class angst, action-packed heist scenes and real opportunities for his cast to shine in their roles.Doug MacRay (Ben Affleck) is a full grown child of Charlestown, a roughneck white enclave of Boston where armed robbery is a profession handed down from father to son. With a long absent mother, imprisoned father and a past of discarded glory, Doug now heads up a four man crew than includes his childhood friend Jim Coughlin (Jeremy Renner), a more ruthless and violent criminal than Doug ever wants to be.The crew successfully robs a bank, taking assistant manager Claire Keesey (Rebecca Hall) hostage as they escape. But when they discover that Claire lives in Charleston, Jim and the others fear she'll lead the cops to them. Doug agrees to check her out to see if there's any danger and winds up falling in love with her. He's inspired to give up a life of crime and get away from Charlestown, but Doug finds himself caught between the overly-caffeinated FBI agent (Jon Hamm) trying to bring him to justice and the demands of a vicious Charlestown crime boss (Pete Postlethwaite) who insists that Doug and his crew perform one last spectacular robbery.With The Town, Affleck again proves that he has little in common with the flashy and hyper-stylized storytelling of today's Hollywood, relying instead on effective but unadorned direction that emphasizes the performance of his actors. All of the main characters carry along some very dramatic moments in the film and Chris Cooper as Doug's father and Blake Lively as Jim Coughlin's sister and Doug's longtime sort-of girlfriend are quite affecting in smaller roles. By giving these characters and actors something to do other than run around and shoot stuff, Affleck provides a comfortable weight and sense of substance to the proceedings.The Town also features two outstanding action sequences, a blunt but very precise sense of humor and nicely balances the demands of heist movie excitement with the more emotional tale of a man caught between what he's always known and what he could never admit he wanted.Even with his sometimes questionable career and personal choices, I'm not exactly sure why Affleck ended up the Stallone to Matt Damon's Schwarzenegger. Whatever put him on this road, it's brought him to the point where he could become one of the best filmmakers of his era. Let's just hope he stays far, far away from Jennifer Lopez.",8,6,11,20 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," Time to put a stake in it
","So, 6 years after the last time Kate Beckinsale donned a leather corset to play vampire warrior Selene and after making a 3rd edition of the franchise without her, the folks behind Underworld come back with a 4th go round which really does nothing more than prove they probably should have left well enough alone after the 2nd movie. With four people credited for the screenplay, it's not exactly a surprise to find Awakening is the worst written film of the lot and the addition of 3D can't disguise the fact that there's nothing visually new or interesting here. If you're a big fan of these films, you might just barely find this one to be passable. If you enjoyed the original, which was a good and solid little fantasy action flick, but noticed the decline in quality of the sequels, you'll find the pattern continuing here.As the motion picture begins, the existence of vampires and Lycans has been uncovered by humanity and the result has been all-out war against the 'infected'. You think that'd be kind of a big deal and take the story in some new direction, but it's nothing more than a plot device. Selene and her hybrid vamp/werewolf lover Michael (not Scott Speedman) get attacked and Selene wakes up from suspended animation 12 years later in a lab. She thinks Michael is the one who freed her but it turns out to be their hybrid daughter (India Eisley) and no, they never even make an attempt to explain where the daughter came from. With the help of a human cop (Michael Ealy) and a new vampire sidekick (Theo James), Selene has to save her daughter. Not from the humans but from a Lycan scheme to create new super-werewolves, which sort of gets back to the whole plot device nature of humans knowing about the denizens of Underworld. It's not a new beginning for the series or anything like that. It's just the hook they needed to get this production off the ground.If you saw Beckinsale in the first two Underworld movies, there's nothing here that will surprise you. Frankly, part of this film get dangerously close to outright fan fiction, such as when Selene revives in the lab and finds her traditional leather outfit just waiting for her to put back on. I mean, what scientific purpose was served by keeping her clothes around for 12 years? Beckinsale looks damn good, shoots a bunch of stuff and there's plenty of CGI Lycans and slo-mo action scenes. If that's all you want, have at it.If you're looking for a good story, even one only as good as the first or second parts of the franchise, don't bother. Underworld wasn't exactly Shakespeare but by fantasy action standards, it was a reasonably intelligent and well put together tale. The sequel was a bit too wrapped up in its own mythos, but was still functional. The third movie was strictly by-the-numbers, though it did flip the dynamic by making the Lycans more heroic than the vampires. However, Underworld: Awakening is a morally confused mess.One of the reasons why the 'vampire as hero' thing works is by being very circumspect about the whole 'needing to feed on human blood' thing. By downplaying that, vampires change from menacing predators to really cool hipsters with super-powers. So, the original Underworld largely removed humans from the equation and focused on the werewolf vs. vampire conflict and put Selene in the role of heroine by defending the only major human character in the story. She then uncovered and rejected the villainy of her own bloodsucking kind, cementing Selene's moral and narrative virtue. Selene may have been a vampire but she never seemed to need to feed on humans and was mostly on our side. That dynamic continued in the 2nd flick and the third cast vamps as medieval tyrants facing a courageous Lycan rebellion where, again, humans were largely left out of the fight.Underworld: Awakening opens with Selene slaughtering a score of human soldiers and then kills some more when she escapes from the lab, including chomping a guy on the neck and feasting on his blood. She's not a good guy who's trying to protect people from bad guys. She's an at best morally neutral creature who's only trying to survive and the viewer is expected to side with her out of nothing more than misanthropic contempt for your fellow human beings. This film assumes there's something wrong with normal people trying to protect themselves from supernatural monsters but never explains what that is. It also doesn't help that the plot is one of those multi-writer efforts where different bits from different versions of the script wind up jammed together on screen. There are too many characters and too many scenes that should have been cut out or significantly changed.There are so few female-driven movie franchises that it's a shame to see this one swirl down the toilet bowl. Beckinsale and the first Underworld deserved the attention and success they got, but it's time to drag these movies out into the sunlight and let them burn up so we can all move on.",4,18,25,23 January 2012
Shutter Island," It's an 'eh' for a Scorsese film, which means it's still better than a lot of stuff out there.
","With Shutter Island, Martin Scorsese has made the greatest Brian De Palma movie of all time. However as a Scorsese film, Shutter Island is just a bit above average.Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a federal marshal in 1954 sent to investigate the escape of a prisoner at an asylum for the criminally insane on an island off the coast of Boston. He's joined by a new parter, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), who spends most of the movie as one of the most useless sidekicks in cinema history. While investigating, Teddy has to deal with the interference of Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the asylum, and Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), the asylum's chief head shrinker. In addition, Teddy is plagued by memories of his role as a US soldier in the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp and by very involved visions of his dead wife (Michelle Williams), who perished in an arson fire. It turns out that Teddy is looking for the arsonist who set that fire and believes he's somewhere in the asylum. It also turns out that Teddy suspects there's some sort of brainwashing taking place on the island that has something to do with the House Un-American Activities Committee. Then after all of that, there's an elongated twist ending that neither truly succeeds nor truly fails.The modern standard for the twist movie is, of course, The Sixth Sense. That's because if you took the twist completely out of it, it still would have been a great movie with a compelling story that stood on its own. Shutter Island does not live up to that standard. Take the twist out of this film and there's really nothing left.Of course it is well directed and well performed. We are talking about Martin Scorsese and a very talented cast of actors. But the story is jammed full of things that just don't work as the movie unfolds, like the uselessness of Mark Ruffalo's character and an excessively melodramatic soundtrack, which are explained and supposedly redeemed by the swerve at the end. The problem with that is twofold.1. You can see a twist coming a long way away. You might not be able to figure out exactly what it's going to be, but there's enough stuff that either seems forced or doesn't make sense to clue you in that something is going to happen. The story doesn't hold together on its own, so you know there's a missing piece that will eventually be revealed. And once you realize a big revelation is coming, it spoils both the set-up and the payoff.2. A twist can't retroactively make a movie more enjoyable. The clanging off notes in the script that are later justified by the twist, remain clanging off notes while you watch them the first time. It's like the fruit at the bottom of a yogurt cup. No matter how much you enjoy the fruit, you need to be able to enjoy the yogurt you have to eat to get to it. The yogurt of Shutter Island seems overstuffed, contrived and simplistic.Don't get me wrong. Shutter Island isn't a bad film. It's atmospheric, well paced and narratively ambitious. The movie pretty clearly falls short of fulfilling those ambitions, though, leaving you with the impression that it should be much better than it is. Scorsese and company have made a decent film that many viewers would appreciate. That you can't help but expect more than that, really isn't a fair criticism.",5,5,9,14 October 2010
Capote," Capote vs. Infamous
","Every so often, Hollywood produces two or more movies about the same subject at virtually the same time. Sometimes it seems like happenstance, sometimes it seems like ego and sometimes it's a lesser production trying to piggyback on the buzz and hype of a superior work. If we're lucky, one of them turns out okay. Very rarely do we get more than that. In the two movies made of Truman Capote and the writing of In Cold Blood, we got two very good films, though one is far better than the other.In November of 1959, a well-to-do Kansas farmer, his wife and their son and daughter were brutally murdered in their own home. The crime was so sensational that it even merited a front page story in the New York Times. That's how the horrible deaths of the Clutter family came to the attention of Truman Capote. A novelist and screenwriter of some regard, Capote is more renowned for his presence in the New York City social scene. He was the sort of devilishly irreverent and sharply insightful fellow everyone loved to know or say they knew. Capote first thinks to do a magazine article for the New Yorker about the impact the Clutter murders have on small town Kansas life. But after journeying to Kansas with his best friend and fellow author Nelle Harper Lee, Capote finds something more than a magazine article. Particularly after he meets one of the murderers, the complex and conflicted Perry Smith, Capote seizes on the idea of using fictional storytelling techniques to tell the true story of the Clutter murders and their aftermath. He pours all of his heart and soul into the work, only to be tortured for years as he must wait for the execution of the killers before his has an ending for his masterpiece. But in producing one of the greatest American books of the 20th century, a novel that changed the way non-fiction stories are told, Capote appeared to destroy himself and never wrote another significant thing for the rest of his life.Infamous is a greater effort of filmmaking than Capote and I'm now going to praise the former at the expense of the later, but I want to first mention that Capote is still a fine film and worth seeing. It's just not as good as Infamous.Fundamentally, Infamous is the better written movie and it's not even close. I t has more well drawn and meaningful characters, tells the story in more detail and depth and provides a much clearer picture of what happened and why. Whether it was Capote and Lee's interactions with the Kansas natives, Capote's place in New York's literary circles, Capote's relationship with his lover Jack Dunphy or his affinity for the doomed Perry Smith the other killer, Dick Hickock, Infamous is more informative, engaging and dynamic.That difference in quality extends to the performances, though that's a bit unfair to the folks in Capote. The cast of Infamous is given so much more to work with that it was almost inevitable they'd do a better job. The greatest example is the distinction between the main characters of these films. Toby Jones' Capote is flamboyant, mincing, gentile, driven and both charming and distant at the same time. Philip Seymour Hoffman's version gives a few glimpses of humor and wit, but is mostly quiet, solemn and overtly detached. They have the same odd and Southern-tinged voice, but these performances have very little else in common.That contrast in the level of characterization extends to just about every part. In Infamous, we're presented with an interpersonal dynamic that tries to explain why the effeminate Capote could be in love with the more macho and straight-laced Jack Dunphy. In Capote, they're simply presented as a couple with no real explanation of why these two men would ever be together. In Infamous, Dick Hickock is given a few scenes to show the audience how shallow and uninteresting he is compared to the wounded and violent Perry Smith. In Capote, Hickock is barely in the film at all and therefore doesn't serve as a comparison to Perry or the Perry/Capote relationship.Now, only the actual people involved in this story and those who knew them can testify to which version is more historically accurate and personally fair. But there's a line in Infamous that says In Cold Blood brought a kindness to Capote's writing that hadn't been there before. That sort of kindness is absent from Capote the film. It presents the writer as a fairly nasty piece of work who only summons up some regret and remorse at the moment of crisis. Infamous shows Capote as a basically decent person who, under immense personal and professional stress, behaved in unfortunate ways.What ultimately distinguishes these two movies is that I think Infamous is trying to be entertaining while Capote is trying to be significant. Capote is dominated by quiet scenes of no action or dialog that are clearly intended to be meaningful and moving. And if you're a devotee of New York literary history and already know well the story of Truman Capote, you might be able to make those scenes meaningful and moving in your own mind. But even if you've never read In Cold Blood or heard of Truman Capote, you'd still find Infamous a delightful experience.",7,0,0,23 September 2010
Pacific Rim," If any filmmaker desperately needed to fail, it's del Toro.
","The greatness of Guillermo del Toro as a filmmaker is his ability to tap into the pure imagination of childhood. The failing of del Toro as a storyteller is that he's not grown up enough to discipline that imagination. He embraces fantastic ideas and marvelous imagery but, left to his own devices, his films falter on simplistic and underdeveloped characters, boring and meandering plots, clichés piled on top of clichés and an unwillingness to get everything to make sense. Like a child, del Toro doesn't notice if he's being repetitive or nonsensical or erratic or if his story isn't going anywhere.Pacific Rim is probably the best looking giant robot vs. giant monster movie ever made. The special effects and fight scenes are remarkable to watch. Outside of those scenes, this film isn't any better and might be a bit worse than the average man-in-suit Godzilla flick from Toho. Frankly, the prologue where del Toro world-builds the setting of this motion picture is more interesting and more dramatically compelling than everything that follows.After years of Mankind using giant robots to kill giant monsters coming out of a dimensional rift on the ocean floor, a fallen hero is resurrected to help in a final attempt to end the war. A bunch of stockier-than-stock characters are introduced. There's a tired subplot with one of the guys from It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Big battles ensue. The good guys win. Granted, most folks are looking for stuff like Pacific Rim to be a combination of Mamet, Shakespeare and Steinbeck, but there's not a moment of alleged drama or comedy here you haven't seen many, many, many times before.But del Toro can't even manage his clichés right. He spectacularly introduces his main hero, played by Charlie Hunnam, and sets up the character's personal challenge. Then del Toro relegates his hero to bystander while he elevates a series of secondary characters to the fore. That might have been bold if their stories were at all entertaining or original. Those secondary character arcs, however, are arbitrarily manufactured, introduced and mostly left unresolved. This could have been Hunnam's big shot at movie stardom. Instead, you'll barely remember he was in the movie.By the standards of summer blockbusters, Pacific Rim is unexceptional but okay. Maybe if it bombs, folks will stop letting del Toro run wild and force him to marry his amazing vision to some cold, hard, practical thought.",Null,5,13,13 July 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Who'd ever think that 'Ben Affleck, director' would turn out to be a good thing?
","In his directorial debut, Ben Affleck wraps the mystery of a missing child in the social dysfunction of Boston's white underclass to produce a haunting tale of the choices people make and the choices the refuse to consider.Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) is a private detective. He and his live-in girlfriend, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan), specialize in missing persons. Usually that means people who are missing in the sense that they've skipped out on their debts, but then they're hired to find the missing daughter of Helene McReady (Amy Ryan). Helene's not the one who hires them, though. She's a boozy addict and the sort of mother who leaves her child locked inside a car on a hot day. It's Helene's brother and sister-in-law (Titus Welliver and Amy Madigan) who hire Patrick and Angie.Working with detectives Remy Bessant and Nick Poole (Ed Harris and John Ashton) under the skeptical watch of Captain John Doyle (Morgan Freeman), Patrick and Angie plunge into a world of drug dealers, child molesters and the Irish Omerta code of ethnic white Boston. And when you think their investigation is over, it's really just beginning.The society of working class Boston is at the heart of Gone Baby Gone. It's a world that is rarely seen in popular culture, unless it's being laughed at on Jerry Springer or Maury Povich. These are people who exists very much like their ancestors did in Europe hundreds of years ago, living their entire lives inside a small geographic area and seeing everyone from the outside as out to get them. Patrick Kenzie is essentially a white version of Shaft whose connections and upbringing allow him to glide through ethnic white Boston in a way the police can't.Director Affleck handles the film's multi-layered mystery with a fine hand and structures the story so his actors have more to do than serve The Almighty Plot Hammer. His direction is a bit more mannered here than in The Town, befitting a slightly less confident storyteller, but he effectively blends his vision with the strong performances of his cast.There are only two flaws to Gone Baby Gone, one minor and one not so much. Casey Affleck looks far too young to be Patrick Kenzie. Even if the ages of the actor and the part technical match up, someone like Patrick should be far more weathered and worn than the fresh faced Affleck. The movie even explicitly acknowledges that, though such recognition doesn't change the noticeable contrast. The other problem is that Gone Baby Gone is ultimately about two extreme decisions, only one of which fits the character who makes it. The decision is defensible within the context of the story, but it doesn't make sense for the character. Without giving too much away, someone who pals around with drug dealers enough that a dealer will do him a significant favor for friendship's sake is not someone who's going to adopt an absolutist moral view on anything. This off-note in an otherwise compelling tale robs it of some of its emotional impact.With Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Ben Affleck has established himself as potentially one of the best filmmakers of his generation. We'll have to see if he can grow from here or if he'll settle for being something like the Woody Allen of Boston-based dramas.",7,0,1,13 July 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," I guess this is what Marvel movies are going to be from now on
","There is a high level of craftsmanship on display in this film. It's packed with funny lines, expertly juggles a huge supporting cast and has some of the best super-hero fight scenes yet. Captain America: The First Avenger is also shallow, superficial and contrived in all the negative ways one used to mean when using the phrase 'comic book' in a derogatory way. So while the technical storytelling is quite good and entertaining, this movie is not just substantively a step or two below Spider-Man 2 or Iron Man. It's heart and soul also doesn't measure up to far less proficient super-hero flicks like Thor or Ghost Rider.Let me be clear. This is a fun movie and worth seeing. It's basic competency puts it far above thoroughly flawed works like Spider-Man 3 or Green Lantern. But it joins Thor as another indication that Marvel super-hero films are evolving toward commercially adept but creatively barren products. They're turning into a new version of the buddy cop genre where filmmakers never attempt to reach the audience in anything more than a trivial fashion. When done well, they can be a perfectly acceptable diversion. When done poorly, they can be a waste of time. Good or bad, however, they barely even attempt to say something thematically, dramatically or emotionally to the viewer.Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) is a scrawny kid from World War II era Brooklyn who desperately wants to join the fight against the Nazis. He's too physically infirm for the military, but gets inducted into a secret program to create an American super-soldier. Steve's puny body is transformed into the ultimate of athletic perfection and eventually finds himself caught up in the struggle to stop renegade Nazi Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving) from taking over the whole world, though how and why Schmidt is going to do that is pretty foggy.Captain America: The First Avenger is divided up into three sections which are all well written and well framed but have progressively less and less creative worth as they go along. The first part is about Steve's scientific transformation from puny man to superman and it is as good as any super-hero origin in cinema. It gets more screen time than most origin sequences but it is expertly done and is, by far, the best part of the movie. The second part is all about how Steve ended up in his red, white and blue uniform. It spends more time than any other super-hero flick that I've ever seen or even heard about explaining and justifying the main character's costume, which is just inescapably odd given how well established the conventions of the genre have become.The second part is fairly clever and well performed, but to no effective purpose and some cracks start to show up in the script. For example, the general in charge of the super-soldier program refuses to let Steve fight on the battlefield and then mocks him for becoming a USO performer instead. But the only reason Steve is on the stage instead of the killing grounds of Europe is because the general wouldn't let him fight. That doesn't make any sense and is a little window through which you can see that there's nothing going on underneath the surface of this story.The third and final chapter of Captain America: The First Avenger is a constant stream of action scenes that are well performed but with hardly any plot or direction or personal involvement from either the characters or the audience. It's all pretty to look at but has no meaning or impact beyond that appearance.There are two great examples of what I see as the hollowness of this motion picture. First, a very big deal is made about how Steve Rogers is perfect for the super-soldier program specifically because he's a physically weak but morally strong man. The chief scientist behind Steve's metamorphosis essentially says that making a strong man stronger will only produce a bully and it is only the weak man made strong who understands the value of strength. The film goes to great lengths to establish that it is Steve's compassion that will truly make him into a hero. But then absolutely none of Steve's personal qualities have anything at all to do with the rest of the story. He's nothing more than Generic Action Hero #12587 and there's no reason why anyone else couldn't or wouldn't do the things he does.The second illustration of the emptiness of Captain America: The First Avenger is the character of Johann Schmidt, know in the comics as The Red Skull. For reasons I can't quite fathom, though perhaps it has something to do with the upcoming Avengers movie or an expected sequel to this flick, The Red Skull is almost totally de-Nazified and left without even a trace of identifiable Aryan ideology. He's reduced to having no identity or motivation other than being evil, like the worst sort of cardboard villain from a 1940s movie serial. I've watched this movie and read a bunch of Cap's comics over the years and I have no understanding of what The Red Skull actually wanted to do in this story, why he wanted to do it or how he planned to accomplish it. Does he want to take over the world? Does he want to destroy it? Precisely how will his giant flying wing do either of those? I mean, Doctor Doom from the two crappy Fantastic Four movies has a more defined agenda and personality than this Red Skull.I may be a bit too hard on this film because it is a well above average piece of entertainment. It's simply hard to ignore how it is fundamentally less creatively and narratively interesting than the best super-hero movies of the recent past.",6,10,26,24 July 2011
Burn After Reading," Definitely a lesser work by the Coen Brothers
","When you watch a movie and don't understand what it's about, you might just be stupid. When it's clear the folks who made the movie don't understand what it's about, that's when the viewer is better off being stupid. While Burn After Reading looks and sounds like a typical Coen Brothers production, there's an awkwardly flat feeling to it because the Coens seem to change their mind from scene to scene, and almost from moment to moment, as to whether this film is being serious or funny, sarcastic or earnest, realistic or over the top.Osbourne Cox (John Malkovich) is a CIA analyst who's lost his job. He's the sort of pretentious intellectual who pronounces the word 'memoir' as 'mem-wah' and sees himself as the superior mind at war with a world full of morons. Osbourne is married to Katie Cox (Tilda Swinton), a jagged iceberg of a woman who quickly becomes disgusted enough with her unemployed husband to consider divorce. It also helps that Katie is having an affair with Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney), a boor of a U.S. Marshal with the slippery charm of a good used car salesmen.Osbourne tries to write a book about his life in the CIA, only to discover that he doesn't have anything to say. A copy of what he does manage to put to page falls into the hands of Linda Lizke and Chad Feldheimer (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), co-workers at a fitness gym. Linda seizes on what she thinks is classified information in Osbourne's book as a way to pay for the plastic surgery she desperately wants, either by blackmailing Osbourne or selling it to the Russians because all of Linda's knowledge about spying and espionage appears to have come from the James Bond films she watched as a much younger woman. As for Chadwell, he's a high spirited meathead who can't handle anything much more complicated than a treadmill.The circle completes itself when Harry starts having an affair with Linda while simultaneously moving in with Katie. As Linda and Chad try and extort money out of Osbourne, someone starts following Harry and everyone winds up tangled together in one of those instances where everyone's mutual idiocy winds up looking like some sort of intricate scheme.From the very beginning, Burn After Reading is never able or even willing to establish a consistent tone. Nowhere is that more evident than in the vastly differing performances of the cast. John Malkovich plays it like he's in a black comedy about a self-important man discovering he's an insignificant cog in the world machine. Tilda Swinton acts as though she's in a comedy of manners. Frances McDormand is doing a satire on the issues of aging and body image to a middle-aged actress. George Clooney is doing a straight midlife crisis movie. Brad Pitt's mugging for the camera falls somewhere between parody and spoof. Like most Coen brother movies, the humor here is supposed to flow out of the characters' interactions. Because these people are all telling different stories, nothing ever gels and no one has any chemistry with anyone else.Unlike most Coen brother films, this story is so poorly constructed, though, that you're never waiting to see what happens next. You're only waiting for the movie to end. A sign of a poorly plotted script is one where major characters simply vanish for long stretches of time because there's no room for them. In this case, it's Osbourne who disappears for the middle of the film and Katie who fades away at the end. They're the first characters we're introduced to, but Harry and Linda come to dominate so much of the narrative that the movie ends up ignoring the very people it initially establishes in the viewer's mind.Another sign of a poorly written script is when the authors introduce a character to explain or underline things for the audience. That's exactly what the Coen brothers do here. Writers who do that fool themselves into thinking the viewer is too dumb to get the point. If you have to be that blatant about the point, you're not making it very well.Some bad casting is also at work here. George Clooney is playing a middle aged guy who has affairs with other middle aged women, but middle aged guys who look like Clooney don't bird dog women their own age. Brad Pitt is also way to old to be playing a brainless hunk of beef, especially when he's paired with a female character that's consumed with worry about her own age and physical appearance. Pitt is in great shape here, but there's a point when you can no longer play young and he flew by that a while ago. Linda and Chad are clearly meant to be an older woman and a younger guy, but Pitt is much too close to McDormand's age for that to work and the movie never acknowledges that. There might have been something to be made out of a woman of McDormand's years who wants to look better and a man of Pitt's age who does look better, but that's never even hinted at.It is the Coen brothers, so there's still some stuff worth watching here. None of it comes completely together and Burn After Reading never engages your mind or your heart.",4,3,9,1 February 2011
The Last Legion," Colin Firth: Action Hero!
","The cartoonish absurdity and fumbling melodrama of this movie can be summed up in a single phrase - 'Look! It's Colin Firth: Action Hero!'In the dying days of the Roman Empire, a young boy is crowned emperor just as the Goth's invade and sack Rome. The deposed child emperor Romulus (Thomas Sangster) is imprisoned on a distant island. His bodyguard Aurelius (Colin Firth) teams up with Mira (Aishwarya Rai), a mysterious warrior from the Eastern Empire in Constantinople, and leads a small band of generic action movie characters to free him. After freeing Romulus and the boy's teacher Ambrosinus (Ben Kingsley), our intrepid band also picks up a magic sword. Left with no other place to go, they set off to Britannia for the last Roman legion loyal to the emperor. They're pursued by Wulfila (Kevin McKidd), the Goth put in charge of Romulus' prison, and in Britannia they run into a guy in a golden goat mask named Vortgyn (Harry Van Gorkum). It all ends up in a huge battle where Aurelius has to rally the last legion with one of the lamest battle speeches ever and that ends with all of the enemy soldiers needing to have telescopes to know they've been defeated.The Last Legion is like an action movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture. There are certain plot points and character moments that are standard in action movies and this film ticks through them like clockwork. These filmmakers don't even try to do anything we haven't seen in a hundred other action flicks before. Frequently, it appears the filmmakers don't even understand why they're telling the story the way they are. They just know this is how the story has been told before, and that's the only way they can think to tell it.There's no sex in this film, there's no interesting dialog and the action is both pedestrian and fake. There's a scene where Romulus falls 30 feet to a stone floor, breaking through a wooden staircase on his way down, and the kid gets up like he fell out of bed. Aishwarya Rai spins around like a meth-fueled whirling dervish, dispatching a truly ridiculous number of enemies. Even senior citizen Ben Kingsley runs around kicking ass and taking names.If you've never seen an action movie set in the Roman Empire before, you might find The Last Legion mildly entertaining. But if you've never seen an action movie set in the Roman Empire before, you should watch Gladiator, Spartacus, Ben-Hur and about a dozen other films before you even think of watching The Last Legion.",4,0,3,24 September 2010
Watchmen," It's not as good as the comic, but what could be?
","Adapted from perhaps the greatest comic book story ever told, Watchmen needs to be reviewed on two separate levels.For those of you who have never read the comic, this movie is long, extremely violent and displays more male nudity than most porno films. It asks you to imagine an alternate reality where people back in the 1940s really did start to dress up in costumes and beat the snot out of criminals, becoming a significant aspect of American culture. It then asks you to accept the creation of a second generation of heroes in the 60s, complete with a nuclear superman who can manipulate matter and energy with his merest thought. Then it asks you to embrace an aging Richard Nixon who is still President in 1985 with the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the brink of nuclear war and someone killing costumed crime-fighters.That's a whole lot of suspension of disbelief to swallow and if you're not willing to gulp it down, you'll probably not enjoy this film. As the underlying plot moves in fits and starts, it spends a lot of time examining this alternate reality, its history and the sort of people crazy enough to become masked vigilantes. I f you can choke down your disbelief, you'll find Watchmen to be one of the more interesting movies you've ever seen. It will probably take you at least 2 or 3 viewings to notice every little detail included in almost every frame. Though I'm certain you'll notice the blue penis right away.For fans of the original comics, this movie is a mixed bag at best. The filmmakers do an admirable job of taking the basic plot and main characters and getting them on screen without messing things up too terribly. When adapting a work as complex as Watchmen, it's incredibly easy to make a mistake about what to take out, what to leave in and what to change, ending up with something embarrassingly bad. That hasn't happened with this movie and, in fact, the opening credits are remarkable in how they capture so much of the essence of the comic.Unfortunately, those opening credits are the closest the film gets to that essence. Most of the movie resembles what was in the comic, but it's just a bit off. The best example is that the Dan Dreiberg of this film is not fat. The character is close to what he was in the comic in other respects but a Dan Dreiberg who isn't fat, isn't Dan Dreiberg. There's a lot of stuff like that which could really drive you up the wall if you let it.On the positive side, Jackie Earle Haley is great as Rorschach, Billy Crudup captures the human inhumanity of Doctor Manhattan and Patrick Wilson gets the rest of the non-fat Nite Owl II right. I don't think Jeffery Dean Morgan is nearly seedy enough to be The Comedian, but your mileage may vary. They did change the ending, but I'm not sure that really accomplishes anything. It does give the audience one less unbelievable thing to accept, but it doesn't make any more sense or work any better than the comic ending. In fact, when you consider the point Alan Moore was trying to make with the comic ending, it's probably quite a bit worse.Whether you like this film or not, I hope it encourages people to read the original comic. And it certainly gives us fans an excuse to read it again. I suppose that's not such a bad legacy for any Hollywood adaptation to have.",7,0,3,21 October 2010
American Psycho," Mesmerizing satire on the 1980s
","American Psycho is a movie that casts the 1980s as a vacuous, amoral, materialistic, nihilistic, degrading and degraded era of American lifebut it tries not to be too judgmental about it. Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) works at a major New York financial firm doing whatever it is well-dressed men do as such places. Bateman is utterly self-absorbed and obsessed with his appearance and is jealous of anyone more socially successful than he is. He's cheating on his fiancée and knows she's cheating on him. He hangs around with three businessman friends who only talk about getting high, getting lucky and getting into the trendiest New York hot spots. Oh, and Patrick Bateman is also an insane serial killer. Now, given that, you might expect American Psycho to be some sort of thriller where Patrick Bateman is the villain and we watch him systematically slaughter people in ironically appropriate ways until one of his intended victims or some cop finally put an end to him. This movie, however, is about as far from that as you can get. It's not a thriller. The killings are random and without any greater significance. There is no heroic victim, and Patrick Bateman isn't really a villain. This film is actually a social commentary, punctuated with moments of crazed violence and an ending that wants to leave you with more questions than answers. As social commentary it doesn't have a very dynamic plot and how much you enjoy it depends a great deal on whether you get the point it's trying to make and agree with it. But if you do both of those things, this is an almost hypnotically disturbing film that keeps you on edge until the very last moment. Christian Bale does a very fine job with an unusually difficult character to play. Patrick Bateman is all surface. There's no internal life or self-awareness to him. He also happens to be very evil. But he's the main character in this story and we see and hear and experience the world mostly through his point of view. It's hard to spend that much time with that intrinsically limited a character and not get sick and tired of them. Bale manages to hold your attention and emotional involvement all the way through, and not just through his inherent charisma. He lets you feel sorry for Bateman as a man who is desperate for satisfaction in his life but cannot achieve it and doesn't even really know what it would be. Bateman has no conscience but Bale makes you feel that he as an actor might have one, giving the audience something to connect with. The social commentary in American Psycho comes from our observing Bateman in his natural environment and noticing that the rich New York City crowd he runs with isn't that different from him. Indeed, the film forces you to wonder why they all aren't out butchering people left and right and suggests that Bateman is just more honest about what he is while the others never stop to think about it. I n a world of yuppie scum, the serial killer is the only one with any real spiritual integrity. This is a very well directed film. Haron crafts scenes of berserk violence with an almost dreamlike serenity. She not only makes us understand the social hierarchy and status competition that these financial sharks pour into their business cards, but she also makes us see how completely arbitrary and nonsensical it is at the same time. American Psycho does have one of those 'twist' endings. You know, where the stuff you just spend and hour and 40 minutes watching turns out not to be what it appeared. But while many of those kind of endings ruin a film by making everything you see meaningless, American Psycho gets it right. Instead of just rendering everything before it invalid, this twist ending gives it all a different interpretation. What happened may not have happened but it still meant something. American Psycho is a movie with a sedate, intellectual veneer about a world where veneer is all that really exists. It wants you to think about thatbut it's not interested in telling you what to think. It asks you to substitute your judgment into the story and make of it what you will. So, if you're interested less is something that will entertain you and more in something will make you ponder, try this film.",8,1,2,8 September 2010
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It's almost impossible for an action movie to get any better than this
","Terminator 2 is one of the rarest things in Hollywood. It's the big honking sequel to a great little film that manages to be great itself.The great little film is one of the joys of watching movies . It's a movie that doesn't have a lot of money or star power behind it. It's just storytellers with an idea who makes it come alive on the big screen. Unfortunately, if someone makes a great little movie today, they oftentimes get a buttload of money thrown at them to make a sequel. And almost invariably, that sequel sucks.Terminator 2 is the exception to that rule. This isn't just a great movie, it's actually a more complex and sophisticated film than its predecessor. Ostensibly, it's a chase movie very much like The Terminator, just with the action and spectacle amped up by spending a lot more money. But there's a depth and craft to the story that goes beyond the first movie.Once again, two warriors have been sent back in time, one seeking to kill and one to save John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future savior of humanity from its machine enemies. John's now a budding juvenile delinquent living with foster parents in Los Angels, while his mother Sarah (Linda Hamilton) is locked up in a mental institution after being caught trying to blow up a computer factory. Eventually, John hooks up with a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzengger) like the one from the first film, but this one has been programmed to obey his commands. The other future warrior (Robert Patrick) is a more advanced Terminator, made out of liquid metal that can shapeshift and imitate anything it touches. John and his pet Terminator break his mother out of the institution and come to realize they have a chance to change the future, to avoid the nuclear holocaust that allowed machines to begin hunting down and exterminating mankind. But to do so, they've got to overcome their seemingly unbeatable, unstoppable foe.Perhaps the best and most impressive thing about Terminator 2 is how well written it is. Exposition is one of the hardest things to do well in movies. Usually, there are some things that the audience needs to know and the only way you can tell them is to have a character just say those things out loud. The exposition dump is frequently the worst scene in any film. But there's no one big dump scene in Terminator 2. Instead, we get little bursts of exposition spaced throughout the first three-quarters of the story and every time it makes perfect sense for the characters to be saying the things they're saying. The story also does a tremendous job of establishing things in the audience's mind that later play a major role in the action. The worst sort of writing is when the only way you can resolve a problem or move the story forward is by pulling something out of thin air that's never been referenced or mentioned in the story before. There's never a point in Terminator 2 where you have to wonder 'Where did that come from?' because it establishes everything you need to know so the next step in the story is surprising and compelling, but it still flows logically and naturally from what you've watched. There are also numerous moments in Terminator 2 where characters echo things from the first film but with completely different meanings and context, adding another level of enjoyment if you watched The Terminator.The writing also creates a world where things make sense, even in an outlandish sci-fi concept like this. Sarah Connor starts out the film as a deeply emotionally damaged woman, which is much more realistic than the idea a person could go through what she's gone through and came out smiling and happy on the other side. And even though one of the main characters is this action-adventure is a young boy, he's treated like an actual boy. He doesn't pick up a gun and start blowing people away or turn into some incredible warrior. His mom and The Terminator take care of all that and John helps them in believable ways. It's not like Star Wars: Phantom Menace where young Anakin Skywalker does things just as dangerous and deadly as any of the adults, thereby undermining any real sense of threat of menace.The quality of the writing also enhances the special effects, which usually works the other way around. Many times effects are thrown on the screen to amaze the audience and take the place of the story, but because the effects in Terminator 2 only serve to enhance the tension and energy built up by the story, they still work even they're more than a decade-and-a-half behind today's FX standards.Beyond the quality of the film, Terminator 2 is also remarkable for the message woven through it. This is a movie where numerous people are shot, stabbed, burned and blown up, but it fundamentally believes that human life is valuable and killing is just wrong. John Connor embodies that simple idea, insisting in even the most dire of circumstances that life be respected and protected at all costs. Most violent movies present violence as the way to solve problems. Terminator 2 contends that while you may sometimes need to shoot someone, the only way to really make things better is to get past the need to hurt and kill other people.Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies of all time, with a moral center to it that even elevates it above other great action flicks. And it's also a wonderful example of how an artist can grow and improve himself. The James Cameron who made Terminator 2 was a much better filmmaker than the James Cameron who made The Terminator. George Lucas has shown us that it's just as easy for a filmmaker to go in the opposite direction.",9,2,4,3 June 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Clever, not funny.
","This movie is a wasted effort by a lot of very talented people. It's got a top notch cast and a wonderful concept, but these filmmakers never really figured out what sort of story they wanted to tell and then were too cute by half in the telling of it. Though not without its charms, The Men Who Stare At Goats is ultimately uninvolving and concludes with a burst of feel good moments that are so forced it's like they were manufactured in a labor camp.When the wife of small time newspaper reporter Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) walks out on him, he decides to run away to the Middle East and become a war correspondent covering the aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq. While he cools his heels in Kuwait, Bob meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney) and discovers what should be a far more interesting story. As the two wander through the desert, Lyn tells Bob about his time as a secret psychic soldier for the U.S. Army. Under the new age tutelage of Bill Django (Jeff Bridges), Lyn and others supposedly learned to use the power of their minds to become 'Jedi warriors' capable of the most amazing feats. Then an embittered sci-fi author (Kevin Spacey) joins the program, gets Django tossed out and puts the alleged powers of Lyn and others to evil use.After all the flashbacks are over, the movie suddenly drops the whole psychic stuff and becomes a morality play about American involvement in Iraq, complete with capitalist mercenaries shooting each other by accident and prisoners being tortured on a secret base. Bob and Lyn strike ridiculously quixotic blows against American militarism, then it all wraps up with a call to action that seems to mock the idea that anything can really change.The Men Who Stare At Goats is built like one of those Russian nesting dolls, but not in a good way. At first, it's the story of Bob trying to find meaning and masculinity in his life. But he ends up just standing around while the movie becomes about Lyn's sort-of-but-not-quite comedic adventures as a psychic solider. Then within Lyn's tale, we get the story of Bill Django and his efforts to blend military purpose with hippie counterculture. The most intriguing story is Django's and it's dealt with in the briefest way. Lyn's is the next most interesting but is related exclusively through overly clever flashbacks. Bob's part of this yarn is the least engaging, so of course he's the character the audience is supposed to identify with and follow through the film. You might have been able to make something out of either Lyn's or Bill's experiences, but smooshing them together inside Bob's lackluster 'hero's journey' produces a motion picture that never settles on who or what it's about. And then there's the problem that this is a comedy that tries and usually fails to get any laughs. The humor is too dry to be really funny and too wry to have any real bite. There're also some jokes that simply don't work, like constantly referring to the psychic soldiers as 'Jedi'. That's supposed to be funny because, you know, Ewan McGregor was in the Star Wars prequels. The joke wouldn't work if some other actor had played Bob and it still doesn't work with McGregor in the role. The Men Who Stare At Goats also falls prey to the common flaw of too many 21st century comedies in that what it wants to be is clever. While it succeeds, being clever is not the same thing as being funny. Instead of responding to this film with laughter, you can only admire its cleverness and I generally want a movie to entertain, not ask me to admire it.It's a shame because there's obviously a lot of skill and ability being used here. Too bad it couldn't have been used to a more defined and less conceited purpose.",4,2,7,24 June 2011
Bad Teacher," Only proves how good Bad Santa was in the first place
","What is wrong with people in Hollywood? I don't mean the drugs and the egomania and the somewhat questionable sexual practices. I mean how do people who make a living telling stories to human beings consistently show such poor understanding of the intersection of storytelling and human behavior? Bad Teacher is another in a long line of movies that feels like it was written by some COBOL-based computer program and filmed by the stand it for the robot from Short Circuit. It has no idea what makes characters interesting or how to present them to the audience in an engaging or sympathetic manner. All this thing does is cycle through a bunch of superficial stuff cribbed from other films while a few random jokes get shoved in with all the subtlety of a proctologist with that disease that turns your hands into lobster claws.Elizabeth Halsey (Cameron Diaz) is an inwardly grotesque and outwardly past-her-prime woman who gets dumped by her rich fiancée and is stuck teaching middle school. The plot parades through a series of situations we've all seen before, though with the twist of having them unfold from the perspective of the character who would normally be the villain. There's Elizabeth and the hapless wallflower co-worker, a feud with the sunny-faced teacher across the hall, the rich guy Elizabeth vainly pursues and the other guy that's obviously the one who's right for her. Throw in the old 'big test coming up that the students have to pass' and an unfunny mixture of Bill Murray from Meatballs and Walter Matthau from The Bad News Bears and that's this motion picture.The obvious comparison of Bad Teacher is with Bad Santa. The comparison, unfortunately, is that the latter is an hilarious dark comedy and the former is prefabricated dreck that's about as funny as a tax audit. That's because the folks who made Bad Santa understand how people think and feel and respond. The makers of Bad Teacher understand people about as well as a Lyme disease-carrying tick.The stark distinction is nowhere clearer than between Billy Bob Thornton's Willie and Diaz' Elizabeth. Willie, the titular Bad Santa, is a catastrophically awful person. He's a degenerate alcoholic, consumed by self-loathing and possessing zero self-control, who is rude and mean to everyone in his vicinity. But what allows people to care what happens to Willie is that his problems are produced by his own dysfunction and as much misery as he inflicts on others, he attracts even more to himself. Willie is damaged, he knows he's damaged and the whole film is about Willie trying to escape the prison of his own flaws.Conversely, Elizabeth is a narcissistic bitch and that's all. She doesn't have any profound personal weaknesses. She does bad things to others without ever really suffering herself. She never truly acknowledges or repents of either her miserable personality or baser instincts. There's nothing about the character for the viewer to latch onto and nothing that would ever make anyone root for her. She starts and ends the movie as an utterly unlikable hag who still gets a happy ending, while Willie struggles to become a hero only to wind up in the hospital after being shot multiple times by the cops.That emotional and dramatic illogic extends through almost all of Bad Teacher. Take the main characters' love interests in both films. Willie is pursued by Sue (Lauren Graham), a Jewish girl with a Santa fetish. Elizabeth is pursued by Russell (Jason Segel), a gym teacher who has no reason to be interested in Elizabeth except to try and screw her. But while Willie welcomes Sue's advances, and any pathetic drunk would with a woman who looks like the smokin' hot Lauren Graham, Elizabeth is constantly rejecting Russell in frequently blunt and caustic fashion. Even though she has no attractive qualities other than being good looking, and Diaz stopped being insanely beautiful a few movies ago, Russell continues to throw himself at Elizabeth no matter how many terrible things she does to him or others. One of these relationships makes sense within the context of its story and is even charming in a rolling-around-in-the-gutter way. The other makes no sense except as the product of the Almighty Plot Hammer.Bad Teacher does have a few laughs, though they have little connection to either the plot of theme of the movie, and it's probably rates a 6 on the Judd Apatow Raunch-O-Meter. It's not aggressively repellent and you might enjoy it if you're in the right mood, but it follows Green Lantern as another big movie of summer 2011 that appears to have been made by people who didn't know what the smeg they were doing.",4,2,7,29 June 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not bad, but not better than what Raimi's Spider-Man 4 would probably have been.
","To preface this review, I thought Sam Raimi's Spider-Man was a really entertaining film that managed to overcome some pretty big mistakes. Spider-Man II is one of the best super-hero movies ever. Spider-Man III was a mess that still had a few redeeming features. The Amazing Spider-Man? Well, it was fun with some really strong elements and there was nothing as garishly wrong with it as the Green Goblin's costume and Macy Gray's appearance in Spider-Man or Topher Grace's botched Venom in Spider-Man III. As someone who grew up reading the comics, I'll credit director Mark Webb with getting right a lot of the little things Raimi did not. But while I think this is ultimately a good flick and worth seeing, it's also one of the most fundamentally problematic movies I've ever watched.To start with, this is a retelling of Spider-Man's origin, something we saw only a decade previously with Raimi. As much as they change the details (and we'll get into that in a second) and give this story a very different tone, however, it's telling us stuff with which we're already quite familiar. A good chunk of this film, as nicely done as it is, has an unavoidably superfluous quality. At the more sluggish points of the plot, you can't help but feel like you'd rather be watching Spider-Man IV instead of a reboot of the first movie.Secondly, this thing largely butchers the classic Spider-Man origin. Paradoxically, I suspect most viewers won't mind that much because the more traditional (at least in that respect) Raimi take is fresh in their memories. But if this had been the first Spider-movie ever made, comic book fanboys would be lighting themselves on fire in protest. It's not even about them not saying 'With great power, comes great responsibility'. It's that Peter Parker's lesson in responsibility isn't something he learns from the death of his beloved Uncle Ben. It's something he learns during a dinner table conversation with some guy he's never met before. If that's how it had worked in Amazing Fantasy #15, I'm not sure things would have worked out quite so well for Marvel Comics.Thirdly, while the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy clicks thanks to the chemistry of Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the relationship itself is kind of a poorly told joke. While Garfield and Stone are frequently great together on screen, the story underneath them is forced and manufactured. Whereas Raimi provided reasons for Peter and Mary Jane Watson to fall in love, this movie throws Peter and Gwen together because that's what the script says. It also helped that the character of Mary Jane had a life independent of Peter Parker in the first two films. Here, Gwen is Peter's inevitable girlfriend/plot device and not much else. And by the end, The Amazing Spider-Man has truly bollixed up the classic Peter/Gwen dynamic from the comics.Boy, it reads like I'm not much of a fan of this motion picture, doesn't it? The truth is, there's many things about it I like immensely. This is the best ever representation of the change in Peter's personality when he puts on the mask and is liberated of his self-imposed awkwardness and insecurity. Spider-Man is finally the wise-cracking motormouth from the comics. And while Tobey McGuire gave Peter Parker a nerdy, dweebish quality, Garfield actually makes him look and sound like a socially inept teenager. Emma Stone is just great and proves a talented comic actress can fill up a shallowly written role. The fight scenes may not be quite on par with the Doc Ock throwdowns from Spider-Man II, but they're damn sweet in their own right. Sally Field and Martin Sheen are also quite good as Aunt May and Uncle Ben, though they have to share the supporting spotlight with Denis Leary as Gwen's police captain father. Rhys Ifans does a fine job a Curt Connors and the mystery subplot of what happened to Peter's parents is well woven throughout the movie. And, of courseweb-shooters, baby!!Let me repeat, The Amazing Spider-Man is a good film and worth watching. It'll certainly get the bad taste out of your mouth from Spider-Man III. It also looks and sounds far more like Nolan's Batman movies than a piece of Marvel cinema, though it does continue the tradition of Spidey's mask coming off at every opportunity. But is it more than just another summer super-hero blockbuster? Not really.",6,13,26,10 July 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Twee-tastic!
","A new adjective has entered the language relatively recently. It is 'twee'. It's a new enough word that the definition of it isn't entirely settled. Well, at least it used to not be settled. That's because Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is the ultimate example of 'twee'. All usages of the word must now be made in relation to this movie. The 'tweeness' of all things will now be measured on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 = Lawrence Tierney and 10 = Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. If 'twee' were Christianity, this movie would be Jesus Christ.Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) is a 22 year old feeb who's sponging a place to live off his gay friend Wallace (Kieran Culkin) and platonically dating a sheltered 17 year old girl named Knives Chao (Ellen Wong). He also has a sister (Anna Kendrick) who really doesn't need to be in this story. Oh, and Scott spastically plays the bass in a band alongside a lead singer (Mark Webber) desperate to make it big and a drummer (Alison Pill) that's like a caricature of the Janeane Garofalo role in Romy and Michele's High School Reunion.That's an lot of set-up for a simple yet fantastical plot. Scott meets the woman of his dreams (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) and, despite Scott being the Sarlacc Pit of pathetic nebishness, she likes him. In order to date her, Scott must defeat her 7 evil exes in a series of video game/comic book battles royale.This is the sort of movie that when a phone rings, the word 'RING' appears on screen. It's the sort of movie that starts imitating an episode of Seinfeld for no reason. It's the sort of movie that constantly references a subplot for the first half of the film, but that subplot turns out to have absolutely nothing to do with the resolution of the story, like a Return of the Jedi where all references to Darth Vader being Luke's father were removed from the last half hour or a Godfather II where Fredo doesn't get killed.Now, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is extremely well executed, visually creative and occasionally funny. But because there's no unifying theme to its elements of fantasy and because the main character just treads water until an epiphany is forced on him by the script, watching this film is like looking at a merry-go-round. It's fast and colorful but you just get tired of it after a while.One definition of 'twee' is 'something meant to be ironically cute where all the irony has been removed'. That's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. There's a self-conscious, unwarranted and unearned distance that's woven through it. The viewer isn't supposed to identify with Scott. You're supposed to self-awarely recognize that you're meant to identify with him. You're supposed to self-awarely recognize that you're meant to nostalgically respond to the film's invocation of 1990s video games. But nothing is ever done with that distance. It's only there to make the people who made the movie and the people watching the movie feel smarter and more sophisticated than they really are.And that's really twee.",5,14,27,23 August 2010
District 9," I may not be the best judge of this film
","District 9 is a brutal and uncompromising film with a wonderful concept and real visual flair. It's also not nearly as smart or bold as people say.I should preface this review by acknowledging that my opinion of this movie may be colored by the fact that it made me physically ill. It's yet another pseudo-documentary shot in the style of hand held video, so the camera is constantly swerving and jerking and shaking about. Before it was halfway over, my motion sickness kicked in and I spent the rest of the film with a headache and an upset stomach. If you were bothered by The Blair Witch Project or Cloverfield, you'll be bothered by District 9.And besides making me ill, the camera work is also the single biggest problem with this movie. Parts of the film are clearly supposed to be 'real' footage shot by a 'real' cameraman, yet there are other parts of the film where no camera or cameraman existsand it looks exactly the same as the pseudo-documentary footage. It completely destroys the illusion of verisimilitude that's the whole point of using the pseudo-documentary approach. Because the 'real' footage and the stuff the audience sees as omniscient observers looks exactly the same, it only emphasizes how artificial everything is.The story is about aliens forced to live in a segregated slum when their spaceship basically parks itself above Johannesberg, South Africa. The aliens, called 'prawns', live in an apartheid state of oppression and abuse. Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a nebbishy middle-manager for the agency in charge of the 'prawns' who, because he's married to the boss' daughter, is assigned to lead the effort to move the aliens to new and even harsher living arrangements. Then something happens to Van De Merwe that makes him appreciate the horrible things being done to the aliens and he resolves to do what he can to help them escape.This is an excellently made film from most of the technical perspectives. The special effects are amazing and innovative. The story is reasonably well thought out. Sharlto Copley does a very good job portraying Van De Merwe as a realistically non-heroic character. There are a bunch of really interesting ideas alluded to throughout the script.It's hard to get emotionally involved in the movie, however. Besides the artifice of the pseudo-documentary style, the only significant human character in the story is Van De Merwe, and he's so unlikeable and unsympathetic that it's hard to care what happens to him. When the most appealing person in a film is a computer generated, 7 foot tall, repulsive insectthat's kind of a problem. District 9 also never does more than allude to interesting ideas. It doesn't do anything more with the 'aliens living in South African apartheid' concept than the James Cann/Mandy Patinkin buddy movie Alien Nation did with the 'extraterrestrial immigrants trying to assimilate in America' concept. And there's nothing in this movie about aliens being mistreated by humans that we haven't already seen in at least 7 Star Trek, 37 X-Files and 43 Stargate episodes. I fear I'm being too negative about District 9 because it made me want to throw up. It's a graphically violent and somewhat simplistic morality tale that's a bit like the Star Trek remake. It has flaws, but overcomes them to be fairly enjoyable. As long as it doesn't make you puke.",5,5,9,24 January 2011
Lawrence of Arabia," A classic that is both captivating and enlightening
","Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most beautiful films ever made, featuring tremendous performances and a boldly honest look at a complex man and the complex times in which he lived. But while it still ranks as one of the best epics in movie history, the passing decades have also recast it as one of the greatest cinematic testaments to the awesome power of distance that so dominated the affairs of men before the 20th century.T.E. Lawrence was a British army officer serving without distinction in Cairo during World War I who was dispatched by his country's foreign service to Arabia. His assignment was to observe and evaluate the fractured nature of the land and its Arab tribes and their ability to assist the British war effort against the Turkish Ottoman Empire. What Lawrence did was what no one since Saladin himself had achieved. He united the Arab people and led them to an astonishing victory, only to see that victory and Lawrence's dreams for the Arabs shattered against the relentless and unforgiving way of the world.It's hard to say which ranks first with this film. Is it the stunning, captivating bleakness of director David Lean's desert vistas or is it the electrifying and heart breaking Peter O'Toole as Lawrence? They each rank among the best work of their kind you'll ever see. I think the edge has to go to O'Toole because the vast landscapes and searing open spaces that Lean throws up on the screen would dwarf the efforts of most actors. Lean creates a world that emphasizes the smallness of man, making it that much harder for O'Toole to imbue Lawrence with a larger-than-life essence. That is exactly what O'Toole does, however, crafting Lawrence as a figure of staggering potential who finds his greatness realized and then spoiled by mundane realities even he cannot overpower by force of will.O'Toole is back up by a slew of other fine actors, particularly Anthony Quinn and Omar Sharif and rival Arab chieftains who first doubt and then come to believe in Lawrence when he no longer does. Claude Rains is also almost unforgettable as Dryden the diplomat. He and Lawrence represent the twin sides of the British Empire. Lawrence is the heroism and the high ideals; Dryden the calculating, self interested reality those ideals were too frequently tamed by.Watching this movie today, beyond being grandly entertaining, is also a primer on the primacy of distance in human affairs. Though the locomotive had helped shrink much of the West by the end of the 19th century, other parts of the globe like Arabia remained trapped in the iron grip of how difficult it was to get from here to there. Before the airplane truly revolutionized travel, the most towering challenge that faced any man or people wasn't doing what they needed to do. It was getting where they needed to go in order to do it. When you can board a jet today, fly across the international dateline and disembark on the other side of the world yesterday, there may be no better way than watching Lawrence of Arabia to understand the limitations imposed on humanity by the burden of pre-Jet Age travel.Now, this film is long. I mean, it's loooooooooong. They stopped making movies this length over a generation ago. As entrancing as it is, and even with an intermission, this is still a viewing that requires some commitment. That's particularly the case because the second half where Lawrence is broken down by the burdens of his greatness and the immutable nature of his era is intentionally meant to be disappointing and dispiriting, at least on some level.Taking all in all, Lawrence of Arabia isn't merely an outstanding motion picture. This is a legitimate 'must see' for everyone out there. If you haven't seen it, go rent itÂ…though you might want to be sure and get it over the weekend so you've got time to watch it.",9,1,4,22 November 2010
The Mist," Frank Darabont flunks this IQ test
","The Mist is an appalling film on so many levels. It's stupid. It's shallow. It's pretentious. It's dull. It's unpleasant. It's obvious and feeble attempts to manipulate its audience are equaled in awfulness by its intolerant and ill-conceived moral posturing. This is the sort of movie that leaves you wondering what in the world the filmmakers thought they were doing, because nothing about the movie works in any way.Adapted from a Stephen King novella, The Mist tells the story of the residents of a small Maine town that are trapped inside a supermarket when a strange mist rolls in. The mist brings with it bizarre monsters that kill anyone who goes outside, while inside the supermarket a thoroughly hateful woman begins whipping people up into a murderous, religious frenzy in that face of what she thinks is a Biblical apocalypse. Eventually, a small group of people secretly plan to flee the supermarket, preferring to face whatever is in the mist instead of their fearful and violent fellow human beings.And that's about it. I realize that doesn't seem like such a terrible plot, but that's really all that happens in a movie that lasts just over 2 hours. There are a lot of pointless, useless scenes that do nothing but kill time in place of actually telling a story. The plot is very much structured like a fast-paced horror-thriller with the characters being quickly moved into position and the threat being established. But then, writer/directed Frank Darabont slooooows everything down and streeeeeetches everything out so he can pontificate on how religious dogma is merely a cover for the basest human emotions of fear and hate.As bad as that sounds, what's even worse is that Darabont can't even pontificate well. This is a horribly written film, where moral and ethical dilemmas are set up in the most simplistic of ways and where characters not only explain to you what's going on but also detail exactly what it's supposed to mean. There's never a moment when the religious woman isn't plainly evil and what she's doing isn't clearly wrong. Which would be fine if this was trying to be a roller-coaster ride that isn't mean to be taken seriously. But Darabont very distinctly want the audience to take everything he's doing seriously because he thinks he has something important to say. The only thing this movie says, however, is 'Frank Darabont is not as smart as he thinks he is'.That's demonstrated by the fact that there's never any alternative established to the religion that Darabont evidently abhors. Logic and reason aren't that alternative, because the character in the movie that most embodies those traits is a raging jackass who is irrationally skeptical to suicidal extremes. Nothing defines the small group that opposes the religious madness inside the supermarket except the fact they don't get swept up in it. But there's never any reason given or shown for to explain why. Without offering some course to be taken, some other creed to believe, Darabont's effort at righteous thunder feels more like petulant whining.None of the characters in this thing ever act, feel or sound like real people. They're just very dumb nails in service to The Almighty Plot Hammer. Now, the actors all do fairly decent work. Marcia Gay Harden is suitably vile as the religious fanatic who stirs everyone up and Thomas Jane plays the everyman hero quite well. But all of these characters are so cramped and contrived that none of the actors have a chance to shine or even breathe. Take Thomas Jane's hero. There's nothing particularly heroic about him and there's never any reason given for why he's the hero of the story. He just is.And then there's the ending. Oh, boy! This film has one of the most insulting and infuriating endings I've ever seen and I don't mean that in a good way. Sometimes an ending can shock and disturb you because you're caught up in the story and the conclusion punches you in the heart and leaves you stunned. The ending to The Mist will leave you stunned, but at who the hell ever thought this ending was a good idea. It's not just unbelievably idiotic, it's one of those endings that invalidates the story you've just watched and leaves you wondering what the point of watching it was. It's the sort of casual nihilism that marks an immature heart and spirit.The Mist is a cinematic failure in almost every way. Even for a Stephen King adaptation, it's notably bad, which is saying a lot. Avoid this movie like it really was a mist filled with flesh-tearing beasts.",3,1,9,10 November 2010
Clash of the Titans," What do you expect out of this sort of thing?
","The new Clash of the Titans does show off all the advances in special effects made since the original back in 1981. But while the first one wasn't exactly a masterpiece of storytelling, this remake might be even dumber and a bit more obviously slapped together. I don't think these filmmakers tried to make a good movie. I think they tried to make a big, loud, flashy distractionand they succeeded at that.At a time when humanity is rebelling against the dominion of the Olympian gods, young Perseus (Sam Worthington) sees his family killed by Hades (Ralph Fiennes), the lord of the underworld. Perseus finds himself in the city of Argos just as it threatened with divine destruction. For its defiance of the gods, Argos must either sacrifice the beautiful Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) or be destroyed in 10 days by the monstrous Kraken. Perseus sets out on a quest to find a way to defeat the giant beast, but not before learning that he is the son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). Joined by a small band of warriors and an immortal girl named Io (Gemma Arterton), Perseus battles a series of CGI creatures and one dude in traditional monster make up.This film looks good, though it doesn't come close to the visual magic of Avatar. It moves relatively quickly, has a few honestly funny lines and its action scenes are both reasonably exciting and comprehensible. Very little of it makes sense if you think too hard, but who goes to see a movie like this to think?None of the performers embarrass themselves here, though none of them are asked to do more than the acting equivalent of walking and chewing gun at the same time. Only actresses Gemma Arterton and Alexa Davalos are noteworthy, each making a real effort to give depth to roles that don't ask them to do more than look pretty (which they also do quite well). Sam Worthington continues the trend toward more straightforward and unflamboyant action heroes. He's little more than a crash test dummy in this film as what little characterization there is in this script gets sprinkled among the supporting roles/cannon fodder.The new Clash of the Titans isn't 'good' in any meaningful sense of the word. For a big budget blockbuster, though, it isn't noticeably bad. The bar for these sorts of movies has sadly been set rather low and this film barely manages to get over it. If you like this sort of cinema, you'll have a decent time. If you loathe this sort of brain-optional spectacle, there's nothing here to change your mind.",5,1,2,10 September 2010
Paranormal Activity," Like a grown man playing peek-a-boo with his mom
","This movie is fun, creepy, excitingand I'm embarrassed at how much I liked it. I feel like a grown man who just enjoyed playing peek-a-boo with his mother.To put it bluntly, Paranormal Activity is like a remedial version of The Blair Witch Project. If you loved the latter, you'll find the former less entertaining but still well worth seeing. If you're one of those types that has taken to ripping The Blair Witch Project to prove how smart and sophisticated you are, every single complaint and criticism you've made applies even more so to Paranormal Activity. So, your reaction to this movie will depend on whether you've taken the stick out of your butt.Katie (Katie Featherston) and Micah (Micah Sloat) are a young, unmarried couple living together in a big house in San Diego. There are two other important things in the house with them. One is a video camera they use to tape everything that goes on. The other is an invisible demon who repeatedly torments them. The world's biggest psychic douchebag also shows up for some exposition, but it's mostly just Katie, Micah, the camera and things going bang or roar in the night.This film is supposed to be the 'real video' footage of what happened to Katie and Micah, just as the Blair Witch Project was supposedly 'real video' footage shot by those kids in the woods. But unlike its late 1990s predecessor, Paranormal Activity puts up only the barest pretense at being 'real video'. It's less realistic, more obviously contrived and it's impossible not to recognize how the movie is deliberately manipulating your emotions. For all that, though, it's still pretty effective.Let me give you an example. A lot of the movie is shot in Katie and Micah's bedroom where they have the camera set up to record things as they sleep. Their bed is on the right side of the screen and on the left side is their open bedroom door, leading out into a hallway and the stairs down to the ground floor. It's set up that way so you're constantly looking over at the open door, wondering and worrying and freaking out over what might come through it. I was completely aware of what writer/director Oren Peli was trying to do and how he was trying to do it and he still creeped me out.There's something about hand held video and the possibility of the supernatural that hooks into your brain somehow and gets you to believe. The fact that the acting is just okay, the dialog beyond banal and the plot kind of tedious simply plays into your suspension of disbelief and makes it feel more true. That magic is the reason why there's 327 different shows on cable TV about people looking for ghosts with video cameras, even though every single episode of every single show is exactly the same.1. The go somewhere to look for ghosts.2. They don't find any.3. The end.Maybe it's because we grow up associating video footage with the news or with our own home movies and it programs us to involuntarily respond to all video footage as if it were actually happening. Maybe the first generation who grows up entirely with Youtube will react to video footage as merely another entertainment format, robbing films like Paranormal Activity of their power. But until that occurs, movies like this will be able to come along every few years and scare at least the socks off us.And if you like Paranormal Activity, let me again recommend a movie called Video X. It's not about ghosts, demons or witches. It's about a white trash girl and an even whiter trash guy who video tape their cross country trip that goes horribly awry. I think Video X is the pinnacle of 'real video' filmmaking. It's better than Paranormal Activity and better than The Blair Witch Project. That's because it's more than a trick. It uses the 'real video' style to tell a genuine story of hope, fear, love and despair.I can recommend Paranormal Activity, but Video X is a must-see.",7,0,0,31 March 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," A Care Bear Stare ending can't ruin this movie
","The Adjustment Bureau succeeds on the strength of an intriguing premise, the attractive pairing of its two leads and an interesting supporting character, overcoming some fairly serious plotting issues and a Care Bearish ending to craft an endearing sci-fi romance.David Norris (Matt Damon) is a young Congressman who's running for Senate when he meets a feisty young dancer named Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt). The two of them connect like they were always meant to be together, until an enigmatic organization called The Adjustment Bureau tells David he can never see her again. Made up of shadowy men in magic hats and their helmeted soldiers, The Bureau nudges human beings back in line with The Plan. When you spill coffee on yourself and miss the next bus, when your cell phone dies and you miss and important call, when you can't get a taxi to make an appointment, that's The Bureau shepherding you along according to the designs of The Chairman.The Plan says David and Elise must not be together. When David learns of The Bureau and its influence on his life, however, he rebels and sets out to be with Elise no matter what the cost. With the help of a Bureau agent (Michael Kelly), David and Elise run hither and yon until the Bureau gives up and they live happily ever after. Seriously, that's the way it ends.The Adjustment Bureau is like a great idea for a TV series and a lot of this movie plays out like the pilot episode of such a show. While the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is the best thing about this film, John Slattery as the harried Bureau agent desperately scheming to keep them apart is a very close second. Like a mix of Sam Becket from Quantum Leap, The Phantom Stranger from DC Comics and The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit, Slattery's character and the other Bureau agents are a clever take on the concept of a secret conspiracy that's running the world. To the men of the Bureau, it's just a job with the same office politics and pain-in-the-ass personnel issues as any other.Damon and Blunt are both excellent, creating a compelling enough love affair that it could have sustained an entire movie by itself without any sci-fi trappings. When that relationship is endangered by the machinations of The Bureau, the believability of it generates a decent amount of dramatic tension.Now, the story does have some whanging big plot problems. For example, when David learns about the Bureau and its power over human existence, the film jumps forward three years and the audience is supposed to go along with the idea that David could find out this mind blowing information, then just go back to living a normal life like nothing happened. That's pretty silly. And after letting the audience get invested in Slattery's character, the movie brings in a different Bureau agent for the last half hour or so to be the main obstacle for David and Elise to overcome. It's completely unnecessary and, while the new agent is meant to be a greater menace, he doesn't do or say anything that Slattery's character couldn't have done and said. Instead of being a contest between two sides with the audience torn between who they want to succeed, injecting a never-before-seen character into the mix ruins that dynamic and makes the story so emotionally one-sided that it loses its edge.And then there's an ending that's on par with the Care Bear Stare when it comes to lameness. This is literally how it goes'You must follow The Plan!''But we're in love!''Oh. Okay then, do whatever you want.'Even with serious flaws, The Adjustment Bureau is an enjoyable and slightly thought provoking motion picture. It'd make a great TV show, though.",6,1,3,8 March 2011
The Hangover Part II," A whole lot of crappy sequels have been made this same way
","Boy, there's every reason in the world for this movie to suck. It basically tells the exact same story in the exact same way as the first film, but a little more sloppily constructed and just taking what people loved in the original and cranking it up a notch or three. That approach has produced some truly awful sequels. However, The Hangover Part II is not one of them.Why? Partly because the script is still full of laugh-out-loud moments. Partly because the three main characters and the actors who play them still connect with the audience. Mostly, though, it's because these filmmakers made a pretty bold creative choice that aesthetically redeems the otherwise repetitive nature of this motion picture.This time around, timid dentist Stu (Ed Helms), his inappropriate friend Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the socially inept Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in Bangkok with no memory of what happened the night before. The three are in Thailand, along with the missing-for-most-of-the-first-movie Doug (Justin Bartha), for Stu's wedding to the lovely Lauren (Jaime Chung). Only now, it's Lauren's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) who's missing after his night of debauchery with The Wolfpack and the boys have to retrace their steps through the fetid streets and around monkeys, international criminals and transsexual strippers to find him.That sounds exactly like the first film, doesn't it? Well, it is in most ways. To the folks put off by that, there's really no arguing the point. If you're rubbed the wrong way by seeing another version of what you've seen before, that's not an invalid reaction, especially as this is an inferior version in one big way. While the first movie was about all three main characters, each playing a part and having their own story being told, The Hangover Part II is dominated by Stu and Alan. Phil, who was one of the best things about the first movie, is reduced to tagalong. Frankly, if Bradley Cooper had held out for more money, they could have replaced Phil with Doug and it wouldn't have made much of a difference.What saves this film from disaster is that these filmmakers chose to make a much darker movie than the first one. Not only in being raunchier and more outrageous, but in generating a sense of menace and danger that didn't exist before. I mean, nobody ever thought something really bad would happen to Doug in The Hangover, did they? Yes, they might not find him in time for his wedding, but there was never any doubt that he'd eventually turn up, was there? The Hangover Part II starts its search for Teddy by finding his severed finger, setting a tone that continues through the whole story. From the squalor of Bangkok to the more extreme physical transformations of Stu and Alan to the enhanced isolation of being in a foreign country without anything familiar to fall back on, this has such a different and more intense feel to it that you're not bothered when it duplicates what happened before. If this wasn't a blockbuster sequel and therefore required to have a happy ending, The Hangover Part II should have logically concluded with a wickedly black moment of comedy that would make even Norm Macdonald a little uncomfortable. We don't get that ending, but that sense flows through everything leading up to the conclusion, giving this film a decidedly different vibe.I'm not sure they'll be able to get away with it a third time but while slightly inferior to the original, this is one sequel that manages to validate its existence and reward everyone for coming back for more.",7,1,2,1 June 2011
The World's Fastest Indian," A good family movie, give or take some septuagenarian sex
","A charming but perhaps a bit too long road picture, The World's Fastest Indian tells the true story of Burt Munro (Anthony Hopkins), a New Zealand man who spent 25 years dreaming of a chance to go faster than any man ever had. He wants to take his 1920 Indian Scout motorcycle and race it during Speed Week at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and he's not going to let being 30 years older than every other racer there or living on the New Zealand equivalent of Social Security stop him.Munro is what you could call an old duffer. He doesn't have a house but sleeps on a cot in a tool shed. He never mows his lawn, gets fresh eggs from his chicken coop and pees on his lemon tree every morning. Everybody in his small home town likes him, especially the boy who lives next door and hangs around as Burt constantly works on his cycle. The 1960s New Zealand of Burt Munro is very much like we used to think of small town Iowa before it started to die out, a nice place of nice people who are nice to each other. The town even tries to raise money to help Burt afford his trip to America, but he eventually has to mortgage his property to pay for it.Once in the U.S., Burt has to make his way from the California coast to Utah. His travels lead him to meet a transvestite hotel clerk, a Mexican used car salesmen, an Indian who helps him after he breaks down on the side of the road and a woman who gives him her bed to sleep in. And while Burt is a kind and decent fellow, you can sense that people respond to him because of his quiet sense of purpose.Like all great quests, there are obstacles in his way. Accidents and regulations and police officers and a bit of a heart condition. No problem is ever too terrible or too threatening, though. And unlike many movie quests, but just like most real life journeys, Burt doesn't get through it on his own. Without the help and goodwill of the people he meets, Burt would never get a chance to see just how fast his old motorcycle could go.This is a charming and decidedly uncynical film, highlighted by Hopkins' performance. This isn't the sort of character most would associate him with. Burt Munro is a simple and earthy man whose life is enveloped by his desire for speed. As a young man, he might have been a bit difficult to deal with but age has tempered him and stripped him of the ego that might have sharpened his eccentricities to an edge. His desire to race isn't a compulsion. It's a spot on the horizon he'd just like to reach.Normally, The World's Fastest Indian would be considered a family film. And, outside of Burt getting lucky a couple of times, it fits into that categoryso, depending on your attitude toward septuagenarian promiscuity, this might be a wonderful movie for parents and kids to watch together. This is a pleasant story that believes people are basically good and that success is achieved through the consideration of others. There are certainly worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",6,2,2,3 August 2010
Avatar," A good movie that only exists to further the advancement of CGI
","Avatar is that rare film where everything you ever hear about it is absolutely true. All the criticism is valid and all the praise is justified. It really is the sibling of James Cameron's Titanic, in that it is a very ordinary story presented in an extraordinary fashion. Your opinion of it will be determined by whether you care about what a movie has to say or how it says it.Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a crippled Marine in a future where a corporation has established a mining colony on the alien world of Pandora. Jake's twin brother was part of the Avatar program, where human beings have their minds projected into genetically engineered bodies that resemble the natives of Pandora, 10 foot tall blue humanoids called the Na'vi. The idea is that by presenting themselves in similar forms, they can more successfully interact with the Na'vi. When Jake's brother dies, the wheelchair-bound Marine is offered the chance to take his place because only someone with his brother's DNA can 'drive' his alien form.When Jake arrives on Pandora and jumps into his Na'vi body, he finds himself caught between the scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who wants Jake to help her learn about the aliens and their world, and Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), who wants Jake to get him militarily useful intelligence on the Na'vi. The head of the mining colony, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) doesn't care a whit about Jake, he just wants the Na'vi to leave their homes so he can dig up a mineral called Unobtainium which is worth 20 million dollars a kilo.You may have heard Avatar described as 'Dances with Wolves in space'. Well, that's a pretty fair characterization as the rest of the movie is all about Jake becoming part of the Na'vi, learning their ways, falling in love with a female named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and eventually siding with the aliens in spectacular battle against the humans that are trying to exploit Pandora for their own needs.The computer generated images of Avatar are the most extensive and best looking stuff that's ever been on the silver screen. The scenery is incredibly detailed and realistic. The Pandoran wildlife and the Na'vi themselves are phenomenally lifelike. The advanced technology of the humans, like their Battletech-style armored suits, are more clearly defined and believably designed than anything you've seen before. And unlike some films where the CGI action sequences turn into little more than blurs of color and motion, Cameron is able to slow things down and keep things clear so you can follow what's happening in even the most dynamic moments. Watching this entire film is like the first time you saw the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park or the morphing T-1000 from Terminator 2.Now, the verisimilitude of computerized special effects doesn't really blow me away. I certainly enjoyed looking at Avatar, but I generally need more than that and I just barely got it from this movie. This is an extremely formulaic and pedestrian story. There's nothing boring or stupid about it and if you took away all the CGI effects, this script wouldn't have made a bad film. It just wouldn't have ever been made into a film because there's nothing interesting or compelling about the tale Cameron has written. In fact, there are a couple of points where it seems like Cameron deliberately avoided more complex and potentially engaging story possibilities. I'm not sure if he wanted to keep the story as dumbed down as possible or if he simply focused too much on the special effects, but this is probably the least dramatically ambitious tale Cameron has ever told.Avatar is a fun, exciting film to watch. I can recommend it with no reservationsbut unless you're obsessed with the latest advances in CGI technology, I can't really call it a 'must see'.",6,3,5,26 October 2010
Thor," So, this is what Marvel movies are going to be like from now on?
","Well, there's nothing in Thor that's as bad or off-putting as when Macy Grey showed up in the first Spider-Man movie. There's also nothing in Thor that's as good aswell, anything in the first Iron Man movie. It's thin on plot, stuffed with too many characters and has an imbalance with the best action, special effects and jokes all crammed into the first half. It's also got a few more interesting ideas than usual for a super-hero blockbuster, a lot of appealing performers and is as professionally done as you get for this sort of thing. If you can imagine the lowest bar a comic book adventure flick has to clear in order to be considered good, this film just barely clears it.If you've never read the comic, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is the Norse god of thunder. After impetuously invading the homeworld of the Frost Giants and sparking a potential war, Thor is expelled from Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and stripped of his power. Thor and his magical hammer Mjolnir are both cast down to Earth, with the hammer imbedding itself in the ground under the enchantment of Odin that 'Whosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor'. While his venomous brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) schemes in Asgard, Thor falls in with astrophysicist Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and is forced to accept being a mere mortal. Then Loki's evil machinations make their way to Earth and Thor and a quartet of his Asgardian buddies must fight to preserve both Earth and the Realm Eternal.If you want excitement, some laughs, well done special effects and to look at very pretty people on screen, you'll find all that here. Those are the minimal requirements for a blockbuster of this nature and they're not always met, so you have to give Thor credit for being Perfectly Acceptable Entertainment. If this movie isn't good enough for you, you probably shouldn't be watching this kind of movie. The only real problem for this motion picture is that we've seen super-hero flicks in just the last few years that do an awful lot better than just meeting the minimal requirements. From the comic book verisimilitude of Spider-Man 2 to the sparkling storytelling of Iron to the thematic depth of The Dark Knight, Thor doesn't measure up to those films in any way.The plot is very basic and dumbed down, with Loki's slightly more complex motivations only making the simplistic nature of the other characters more obvious. And besides Thor, Loki, Odin and Jane, there's a total of 6 sidekicks for the god of thunder, two human and four Asgardian, who could have been completely eliminated from the script without losing much at all. There's also two more major supporting characters in Asgard, another major supporting character on Earth and one more minor Asgardian role. That's too freakin' many people gumming up the story. Imagine if Iron Man had tried to squeeze in 4 or 5 more major supporting characters besides Pepper Potts and James Rhodes? Imagine if Spider-Man 2 had given Peter Parker 4 more friends besides Mary Jane and Harry Osborn? Imagine if The Dark Knight had given 2 or 3 more characters as much screen time as Rachel or Alfred? There are also too many scenes where Kenneth Branagh indulges the worst quirk of modern action movies and has fight scenes that are so frenetic that you can hardly tell what's going in them.Here's another example of how Thor is couple of notches down from the best of its genre. Like Iron Man, this story is about a arrogant winner learning to be responsible for himself and others. In Iron Man, that's a journey that takes Tony Stark almost the entire movie to make. In Thor, it's a transformation that happens in a single scene. Thor behaves one way before that scene and acts differently after it, causing it to feel less like personal growth and more like an afternoon spa make-over.Looking good and not running aground in any narrative lulls makes Thor worth seeing. It'll be a shame if such meager accomplishments become all we can expect out of super-hero films.",6,1,5,16 May 2011
The Fountain," This movie is like jumping off the top of the Empire State Building. It's kind of a fun ride until the very end.
","Watching this film is like taking a long, slow, scenic drive that ends with your car going over a cliff and plunging into a bottomless pit of stupid. Writer/director Darren Aronofsky takes the snippets of three baldly melodramatic stories and mushes them together to try and create something new and smart and deep. He fails on all three counts.Tommy (Hugh Jackman) is a medical researcher trying to find a way to cure the brain tumor that is killing his wife Izzi (Rachel Weitz) when he happens to discover the secret of eternal life. Izzi is writing a novel about the embattled Queen of Spain (also Rachel Weitz) sending a brave and loyal conquistador (also Hugh Jackman) to find a mythical tree in South America that can grant eternal life. We're also presented with a bald and pajama-clad Tommy, after some indeterminate eternity has passed, flying through space in what appears to be a giant, novelty bowling ball with a tree growing inside it. He's taking the tree to a star that represented the Mayan afterlife where he expects Izzi to be reborn in some never explained way.As a story that contrasts both the romantic and the practical pursuits of immortality with the end result of that pursuit, The Fountain isn't that bad. The individual plot threads are simple but direct and affecting. Aronofsky also crafts some marvelous imagery through the movie. But it's all fairly weak treacle that needs a big, mind-blowing ending to make it worthwhile.To his credit, Aronofsky tries to pull off a big, mind-blowing ending. But like a cross-eyed cliff diver, he hits the rocks and he hits them hard. The conclusion of The Fountain isn't big, it's overblown. It's not mind-blowing, it's nonsensical. Instead of making you appreciate all that's come before, it makes you regret sitting through any of it. Aronofsky reaches out for meaning, but what he pulls back are two handfuls of hog manure.I would have liked to have been there to see Aronofsky try and explain the conclusion of The Fountain to the actors, the producers, the marketing people at the studio and pretty much anyone at all. It would have been fun to see which of them pretended they understood what he was saying and which ones just let their eyes glaze over. It would have also been neat to see how many different BS explanations Aronofsky practiced in front of his mirror until he had one that he thought he could sell.If you compressed The Fountain down into a half-hour, like it was an episode of The Twilight Zone or The Outer Limits, the cleverness of the premise itself would be enough to sustain the story. When you stretch it out to 96 minutes, however, it needs a lot more and Aronofsky doesn't provide it. The result is a crappy movie with extraordinary production values that's will only captivate budding cinematographers.",4,4,6,18 March 2011
Zombieland," Proof that the Sprinting Dead can be hilarious
","Zombieland is another entry into the long tradition of the great zombie comedy. Wellokay, there's Shaun of the Dead, Fido and now there's this one. So, I guess it's not that long of a tradition. But this movie does reaffirm that when a zombie comedy is done right, it's clever and gory fun.This film focuses on four people who survived the zombie apocalypse and only know each other by the names of their hometowns. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a dweeby, phobic 20something whose social dysfunction is the main thing that's kept him alive. Tallahassee (Woody Harelson) is an ass-kicking redneck with a powerful yen for a Twinkie and an even more powerful need to brutally massacre every zombie in sight. Wichita and Little Rock (Emma Stone and Abigail Breslin) are con-artist sisters who only trust each other and aren't looking for any more company. After a rocky start, the four decide to head to an amusement park in California becausewell, what else are you going to do when the Earth is overrun by the walking dead. Along the way, they learn that there's nothing like everyone else being gone to teach you how much you need other people.This is a damned funny movie. From the neuroses of Columbus, who keeps a list of survival rules that emphasize things like aerobic workouts, basic motorist safety and never, ever being a hero; t o the balls-to-the-wall attitude of Tallahassee, who discovers that he was born to kill zombies and relishes it; to the sisters, who are both smarter than either Columbus or Tallahassee but show mercy to these dumb shmucks; every character contributes something to the comedy stew.This is also a damned bloody movie. These zombies belch blood and tear flesh with abandon. They aren't the walking dead of George Romero. These are the sprinting dead of 28 Days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake and this film shows them killing and getting killed in about as graphic a fashion as you'll ever see.All four of the main actors do a really good job, with Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harelson striking comedy gold as the Mr. Peabody and Sherman of zombie-killing, if Sherman took too many steroids and Mr. Peabody had irritable bowel syndrome. Abigail Breslin is adorable and Emma Stone is able to overcome a very unfortunate set of bangs to be every nerd's fantasy girl.Look, I realize a comedy where only a handful of people have survived an outbreak of flesh eating ghouls isn't everyone's cup of tea. Appreciating zombie humor does require a particular sort of taste. But if you liked Shaun of the Dead or Fido, you should definitely give Zombieland a try.",8,0,1,25 July 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I'd rather watch a marathon of 'Ow! My Balls!'
","Of all the Michael Bay movies that have ever been produced, Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is by far the Michael Bay-iest. It's 153 minutes of him ejaculating his essence into viewers' faces.In the two years since the first Transformers movie, the Autobots and Earth's military forces have worked together to track down and destroy Decepticon invaders (Those are both armies of giant robots that change shape into vehicles, for those of you that missed the first movie or any of the cartoons or toys that have been around since the 1980s). This little war has been going on in secret and they've been hiding the existence of all alien robots from the public. How this didn't all get out after that huge battle devastated downtown Los Angeles in the first film is just one of many, many, many, MANY obvious questions this story avoids like the plague.Anyway, after a ludicrously over-the-top action scene that might as well have been filmed with a kaleidoscope for all the sense it makes, a dying Decepticon mentions something called 'The Fallen'. None of the Autobots know what to make of this because apparently all Transformer history and knowledge was stored in that giant cube from the first film and was lost when it was destroyed. Yeah, that's right. A civilization of giant robots has no back up memory files. Not even a flash drive or something burned onto a DVD. And that's not even close to being the stupidest thing in this film.Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who saved the world from the Decepticons in the first movie, is going to college. He's going to school on the East Coast and leaving behind his incredibly hot girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and his Autobot protector Bumblebee. Apparently there were no closer schools he could attend so Sam could stay near his incredibly hot girlfriend and, I guess, having a giant robot around to do whatever you want must get old after a while. While Sam is leaving for college, he finds a piece of the giant cube from the first movie. He gives it to Mikaela for safekeeping, but not before it zaps his brain with a bunch of alien data. For the next hour-and-a-half of this movie, Sam and Mikaela don't tell anyone they have this cube shard and seem to even forget they have it, despite all common sense and that fact the shard would have been vitally useful at several different moments. And no, that's not the stupidest thing in this film.To cut a long and garbled plot down to size, the Decepticons located a giant machine on Earth thousands of years ago that could provide them with energy by destroying the Sun. They need a special Autobot key to make it work and it's basically a race between the good guys and the bad guys to see who gets to the machine and the key first. There are other twists and turns in the rest of Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen, but since Michael Bay just uses it all as pretexts for explosions, I don't think I need to get into it.This is not just the worst movie I've seen. It goes beyond that. This is the worst piece of entertainment of any kind that I've ever experienced. It make Vanilla Ice sound like Mozart. It makes Ed Wood look like John Ford. It makes The Diary of Desmond Pfeffer feel like Seinfeld. This thing is such an assault of noise and blur and idiocy that I became physically uncomfortable watching it. Imagine the worst moment in the worst Michael Bay movie you've ever seen. Now imagine something twice as bad and repeated at least 100 times. That's what Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is like.Even in the totality of its terribleness, there are certain elements of this movie that are particularly foul and insulting. There is a lot of profanity in it, much more and much harsher than you expect in this type of summer blockbuster, making it really inappropriate for younger children. It also takes the most basic concepts of space and time and chucks them out the window. There are several instances where I would defy anyone to explain how the characters get from point A to point B. The movie also casts President Obama as some sort of simpering weakling, which apparently indicates that Michael Bay is a Dittohead.Let me conclude this review by stating that you should believe every criticism anyone makes about this movie. If anyone tells you Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is good, you should punch that person in the stomach and run away. The only human being who could get any satisfaction out of watching this film is Mike Judge. That's because the existence of this movie and its success at the box office proves just how prophetic Idiocracy really was.",2,5,12,28 May 2010
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Nick, Norah and company are a fun group
","A teen romantic comedy set in the world of indy rock wannabes, Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist gives Michael Cera a slightly less pathetic role than usual and wonderfully recreates the free flowing, borderless anarchy of your late teens. Add in the beautiful Kat Dennings, who's a much better actress than I think she gets credit for and gets to play an actual person here instead of just a girlfriend, and you've got a fun and funny little film. This thing does have an ending that's one of the most pointlessly extended dénouements I've ever seen, but by that point spending a little more time with these characters is not something you complain about.Nick (Michael Cera) is a high school kid still mooning over his ex (Alexis Dziena) when the other members of his struggling band drag him out of his depression and to a gig in New York City. There he runs into Norah (Kat Dennings), a Jewish Catholic school girl who's out for a night on the town with her BFF, the adoringly inebriated Caroline (Ari Graynor). Nick's ex is there too with her new guy, and she also happens to be a schoolmate and frenemy of Norah's. To defy taunts about her datelessness, Nora lassos Nick into pretending to be her boyfriend and helping her get the drunken Caroline home. Nick's bandmates then push Nick and Norah together by agreeing to take care of Caroline. Things don't go so smoothly for anyone after that, but Nick and Norah are stuck together all night looking for Caroline when she goes missing. I don't think anyone could possibly be surprised at how things work out but most everyone will enjoy the ride.This may be one of the best roles in which I've seen Cera. Nick is similar to his type but has much more of a spine and his pitifulness appears to be more the product of his heartbreak and depression, rather than just being a loser. There's a basic strength and togetherness to Nick that's visible early on and it's refreshingly realistic. This is a guy and not a high school archetype. Likewise, while there's a bit of the 'poor little rich girl' to Norah, the film shies away from that and instead focuses on the paradox that Norah can be so forceful when it comes to protecting her friend and so weak about protecting herself. There are moments of this screenplay that perfectly capture that awkward and even combative aspect of extended adolescence where you're desperately trying to connect with someone else while just as desperately trying to define yourself, though they'd just be words on a page without Cera and Dennings so nicely bringing them to life.Now there is a lot of aggressively prominent music throughout this movie, which is normally something that drives me up the wall. Pop or alt-rock songs swelling up on the soundtrack for repeated segues or montages is one of the worst habits of this era of cinema. It's become beyond cliché and too often features just terrible songs that no one besides hipsters ever like. Here, though, the music is good and its constant presence fits the milieu these young people nestle and swim in. It's an effective atmosphere rather than an intrusive bit of product placement.Besides Cera and Dennings, their fellow castmates are quite entertaining on their own and are given just enough to do so that they're more than props surrounding the two stars without ever competing with them for the viewer's attention. Ari Graynor, in particular, has a role that could have gone very wrong, very easily. Yet, there's enough restraint to the part and enough ease to Graynor's performance that it adds a great deal to the whole.The ending of Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist is not good. Essentially, it comes to an appropriate climax (so to speak) and then remembers a heavily stressed plot point is unresolved. So the movie has to keep to going for that and they decide, to kill time, to have Nick and Norah repeat the emotional challenges they triumphed over just 10 minutes before. It's as awkward as any teenage moment in the rest of the film.I liked this motion picture enough to recommend it to anyone wanting a teen romantic comedy that's lighter on crudity and heavier on intelligent characterization. Give it a try.",6,0,0,8 August 2012
30 Days of Night," Not atrocious, but ends up in a corner and uses stupidity to get out.
","This movie is like a mechanism that gets all wound up but ultimately has nowhere to go.30 Days of Night tells the story of a vampire attack on the town of Barrow, Alaska, a community so close to the North Pole that every year they have darkness that lasts for an entire month. Sounds pretty appealing to you average bloodsucker, right? Anyway, the story begins with town sheriff Eban (Josh Harnett) investigating weird events around town and yes, his name is Eban. Why you'd bother calling him Eban when it sounds exactly like Evan is a mystery for the ages. Satellite phones are stolen and destroyed. All the sled dogs in town are brutally slaughtered. A stranger (Ben Foster) turns up in town, looking like he just crawled out of a sewer and talking crazy. Eban, with an assist from his estranged wife Stella (Melissa George), throws the stranger in jail. But then the power goes out and the vampires blitz the town. These aren't your sexy, pensive, frilly shirt wearing vampires, though. These are simple, animalistic creatures who look at humans the way humans look at cheeseburgers. The vamps massacre most of the town with ease, but Eban, Stella and a small group manage to hide in the attic of an empty house, knowing they've got 30 days until sunrise. Not all of them will survive that longand those that do will pay a heavy price.Though the story makes some weak allusions to psychological suspense when the surviving humans are all stuck together in the attic, 30 Days of Night is really just a more complicated way of jumping out from behind a corner and yelling 'Boo!' This isn't a story that flows organically from human (or vampire) behavior and emotion. I t is a mechanism designed to put the characters in the greatest peril possible. But like some other mechanism movies, this one is so smart it has to become stupid in order to work.These characters are trapped in sub-zero weather, with limited food and water and super-strong, super-fast, virtually unkillable monsters prowling around trying to find them. The only way they can survive is to hide, but doing that should kill them after just a few days of cold, hunger and thirst. I suppose you could make a movie of that, but it wouldn't be the commercial horror movie 30 Days of Night want to be. T his film wants to entertain, but it's trapped its characters in a dead end with no reasonable way out. So the movie does what many other movies do in this situation...it gets stupid. The practical realities of how this group of people could survive in this situation are ignored. And because the movie doesn't want to spend an hour and a half with these people just sitting around in the attic, they have to start doing idiotic stuff to get them out of the attic and into danger. But because they don't want the movie to end in 10 minutes, the stupid stuff they do doesn't kill them (unless the plot dictates it's time for a character to die).And speaking of stupid, I have to point out than the vampires end up covered in blood from their attacks on the townspeople. Yet, even though they spend a month walking around Barrow at sub-freezing temperature, they never wipe the blood off and it always stays wet. I would think that even vampires would have some concern for their personal hygiene, but I'm absolutely sure that blood not only dries but also freezes in cold weather.30 Days of Night also has the other weakness common to mechanism movies in that, none of the actions taken by the characters have any real meaning or depth to them. One of the things you can do to make these kinds of films more gripping is to link the physical challenges facing the character to emotional challenges from other parts of their lives. For example, Eban and Stella are separated, apparently over the question of having children. Not to spoil things for you, but Eban has to make a dramatic decision at the end of the movie to save everyone else. If they could have linked that decision to the separation it would have been a much more powerful moment. The problem between he and Stella should have been connected in some way to the problem he has to solve to save everyone, so there's an emotional significance to his actions beyond servicing the Almighty Plot Hammer. Or the film could have focused on how these people all came to this desolate place to get away from other people and be alone, but now they desperately need other people in order to survive. But after dancing around that theme for a few seconds, it's forgotten.I haven't read the comic books upon which this movie is based (and yes, they're comic books and not a graphic novel, you pretentious bastards), so I don't know if the problems with this film come from the source or are the product of adaptation. If you're a vampire fan and are looking for a different take on the subject, you might enjoy 30 Days of Night. But you'd better be ready to go along with the story when it stops being clever and starts being stupid.",4,1,4,1 June 2010
The Green Mile," The best bad movie I've ever seen
","Sometimes it's fun to criticize a bad movie, but not always. The Green Mile is the first bad movie it is going to physically pain me to criticize.This is a story about the death row at a Louisiana prison in 1935. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the hard yet decent man in charge of this last stop for prisoners on their way to the electric chair. Paul is good friends with his boss, Warden Hal Moores (James Cromwell), and is a good leader of his fellow guards. His three closest co-workers are the appropriately named 'Brutal' Howell (David Morse, the young Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper) and the middle-aged Harry Terwilliger (Jeffrey DeMunn). These are 4 decent men trying to do an unpleasant task as well as it can be done.The 5th guard on death row is not so decent. Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison) is a mean, weak and petulant young man who got his job in the prison because he's the nephew of the governor's wife. If Paul or anyone else bothers him, it would just take one call from Percy to cost them their jobs. In the Depression, that's better protection than a platoon of marines.The other important characters in this tale are Jan Edgecomb (the gorgeous Bonnie Hunt), the kind and tender wife of Paul; the vile and deranged death row prisoner 'Wild Bill' Wharton (Sam Rockwell); a meek and comical Green Mile inmate named Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter) and his pet mouse Mr. Jingles; the warden's fatally ill wife Melinda (Patricia Clarkson); and most of all, a gigantic black prisoner named John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan).John Coffey was condemned to die after he was found with the raped and bloody bodies of two young girls in his arms. But when Paul and the other guards witness and experience John Coffey's magical ability to heal people from their sicknesses and their suffering, they begin to doubt that God would grant that sort of power to any murderer and to dread the day when John Coffey will have to sit in that electric chair.I'm not going to go any further into the story of The Green Mile because, well, there's really not that much of a story. I will say the acting in this film is almost universally superb and the direction by Frank Darabont is just as excellent. This movie looks good. It sounds good. It even feels good. For all that, though, The Green Mile is NOT a good film.Firstly, at over three hours, it's just too flippin' long. You could easily cut out at least a half hour and probably 45 minutes and lose absolutely nothing. It's never completely boring, but it's so languid and placid and every scene takes forever to get started, to get going and to get done. It's the sort of too long movie that's not tough to get through the first time you see it, but if you try and watch it again you'll wonder how you ever made it through at all.Secondly, as I mentioned before, there's very little story in this film. There are events that happen and things the characters do, but there's no real purpose to any of it because there's no real conflict or moral in this movie. None of these characters have to grapple with any problem and change because of it. Paul Edgecomb is the same hard yet decent man at the end of the movie that he was at the beginning. John Coffey's the same. Percy's the same. 'Wild Bill' is the same. These characters don't live and breathe like genuine human beings, they're just cogs in a narrative machine. They have a function to serve and that's all. Percy, in particular, couldn't have been more two-dimensional if he'd been run over by a steamroller.Thirdly, what story there ischeats. At the start of the movie, Percy is supposed to be untouchable because of his connections. But when it's necessary for Percy to be 'touchable', those connections suddenly don't matter. The audience is supposed to fall in love with Eduard Delacroix, so what he did to get on death row is never even vaguely referenced even though his guilt is never disputed. For the big sad scene where everybody is supposed to cry, one character joins in with his tears even though there wasn't a single moment in the film to explain why he should be choked up. There's an irrationally cruel ending that 100% contradicts something established earlier in the film. And there isn't a single emotional moment in the whole thing that isn't obviously and blatantly manipulative.Fourthly, as technically good a job as writer/director Frank Darabont did, he appears totally oblivious to the sharply clashing and diametrically opposed tones in his film. He simultaneously tries to achieve a stark, Shawshank Redemption-like realism and a Disney-like family film fantasy. There's both a botched execution where someone slowly burns to death and a prison escape so silly it could have come straight out of The Apple Dumpling Gang or an episode of Three's Company. The Green Mile has R-rated language and a G-rated performing mouse.It bothers me to point out the flaws in this film. That's because so many of the individual pieces of the movie are done so well and it's clearly made with such earnest good intentions. The Green Mile is, in many ways, the best bad movie every made. You'll probably enjoy it a great deal if you have low standards and I truly don't mean that in any condescending way. When a film has these sorts of basic problems, though, it doesn't do anyone any good to pretend they're not there.",5,3,8,4 February 2011
The Reader," Naked Kate Winslet - good! A 'you've got to be kidding me' plot twist - bad!
","This movie might be a lot better than I think it is. It's a good, if somewhat unexceptional, right up until a big revelation. That's clearly supposed to be a moment when the film is striving for deep emotional significance. But at that moment all I could think was 'You've got to be kidding me'. If that moment works for you, you might believe The Reader is a great story. It didn't work for me and I was left sitting in the theater, noticing what a skewed moral center this movie has.The Reader is about the responsibility and guilt that Germany as a whole and for all time bears for the Holocaust. The looking glass it uses to examine that concept is the relationship between Michael Berg (David Kross) and Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet). In Berlin in 1958, Michael is 15 years old and falls into a torrid affair for a summer with Hanna, a woman twice his age. They have a lot of sex and Hanna has Michael read to her constantly. Then Michael begins to feel the tug of girls his own age, and Hanna abandons him for a reason all her own. Jumping forward to the late 60s, Michael is in law school and his professor takes him to see the trial of 6 Nazis prison camp guards. The 6 defendants are accused of letting 298 Jews burn to death in a fire. One of the defendants is Hanna. And no, the story is not about Hanna being wrongfully accused. She was a Nazi and she did let those Jews burn to death. But Hanna has a secret. It is one she is so desperate to keep that she'll willingly accept most of the blame for the massacre. Michael figures out her secret, but lets her be severely punished without saying a word. Then the film jumps forward again a decade or so, with Michael (Ralph Fiennes) now a divorcée with a young daughter who reconnects with Hanna in prison. He sends her cassette tapes of him reading the same books he read to her as a young man. The final fate of Hanna and Michael leads to one of the strangest scenes I've ever encountered, where a character in the film essentially tells the people watching the film that what they've been watching really has no significance.I don't think this is a great movie. I believe the only reasons it's been called great and received a nomination for Best Picture is because of the secret I mentioned before. That, and Kate Winslet being almost perpetually naked in it. I don't want to give the secret away, but let me describe it in a fashion that might help you understand why the secret actually ruined the film for me. The people who made The Reader have essentially taken a Holocaust movie and melded it together with an Afterschool Special. No, I'm not joking.I rather enjoyed The Reader as a fairly pedestrian coming-of-age movie right up until the big revelation, largely because of Winslet's plentiful nudity. But after the big revelation, I sat in the theater and felt nothing but annoyance for the rest of the film. Hanna is a mass murderer and compared to that, her secret is petty and pathetic. Yet this movie fails to recognize or accept the vast emotional, moral and intellectual chasm between the two. That Hanna thinks her secret is worse and more embarrassing than being a mass murder is, I guess, supposed to make her more sympathetically human.However, I am utterly uninterested in feeling sympathy for a mass murdering Nazi and I don't think there's anything wrong with taking that stance. But beyond even that, Hanna thinking her secret is more shameful than being responsible for nearly 300 people burning to death is incontrovertible evidence that she is massively disturbedand the story NEVER acknowledges that. The Reader wants to treat Hanna's situation as this great personal crisis, but it's only a crisis because she's a deeply dysfunctional weirdo. By refusing to acknowledge how odd Hanna is, the film left me unable to accept anything else it was trying to do.There was another film in 2008 that deserved the Best Picture nomination that went to The Reader. It's time for Hollywood to realize that just because a movie is serious and somber and about the Holocaust, that doesn't automatically make it a great film.",4,2,5,8 October 2010
The Wrestler," Like an ode to Kerry Von Erich
","This is a movie you should see if you've ever loved professional wrestling. It's also a movie you should see if you've ever hated professional wrestling. Either way, you'll find a deeper understanding of this violent pantomime that has thrilled millions and killed far too many of its own.Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) was a huge star during the wrestling boom of the 1980s. But 20 years later, he's an aging and broken down man out of time. Whatever wealth he had is gone. Whatever future he had, never was. He lives in a trailer, when he's not locked out for failing to pay his rent. He drives a van that looks like it came out of a 1970s slasher film. He dresses like a guy who's been homeless for 3 years. He spends his week unloading trucks at a grocery store. On the weekend, though, that all goes away. He puts on his shiny tights and steps into the ring once again. It's kind of a pathetic life, but it could have gone on for a long time.Until after a so-called 'hardcore' match, where Randy gets slashed by barbed wire and has broken glass and tacks embedded in his skin, 'The Ram' has a heart attack. He wakes up in the hospital and is told he can't ever wrestle again. That finally pushes Randy to re-evaluate his life and his relationships. He actually tries to get a real job. He tries to reconnect with his long-neglected daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). He tries to get through the tough shell of a stripper named Cassidy and forge a relationship with the single mother named Pam (Marisa Tomei) inside. We learn, however, that if Randy had been capable of getting his life in orderhe'd have done it a long time ago. It's too late for him to stop being 'The Ram', no matter what it costs.This story is sad and depressing on a very deep level. If that's not your thing, this probably isn't the film for you. If you can stand it, there's a purity of human emotion to The Wrestler that's quite something. Randy 'The Ram' isn't a likable character in the traditional sense, but Mickey Rourke takes this loser, this screw up, this bad father and makes you recognize something of yourself in him. Or he makes you see something in him that you wish you had. Maybe Randy's life is ending badly and maybe it's his own fault, but he'll face that end without flinching and no one can really hope for much more than that when their time comes.It doesn't overstate it to say there's probably no other actor who could have pulled off this role than Mickey Rourke. There may be other performers as talented, yet no amount of make up or Method could measure up to the years of hard living in Rourke's own life. Randy 'The Ram' is a man who was larger than life and is now worn down to the bone, physically, mentally and emotionally. Only someone like Rourke, who's journeyed through his own wasteland of failure and self-destruction, could allow Randy to be that small and spent and quiet.Marisa Tomei is also very good as Cassidy/Pam. She mirrors Randy's story as a stripper who has gotten to old for her profession. There just aren't going to be many more good days for Cassidy at the strip club as fewer and fewer guys care to bother with her. And Tomei lets us see the distinction between Cassidy the stripper and Pam the woman and mother. For Pam, Cassidy is just a costume she puts on to make money. She'd rather be her real self but Pam is terribly afraid of showing that to anyone but her son. That's distinguishes her from Randy, who actually prefers his costume to his real self. In fact, he wants Randy 'The Ram' Robinson to be more real than Robin Ramzinski.Evan Rachel Wood doesn't have as much to work with as Rourke or Tomei, but she gives her all to the searing anger and hurt in Stephanie. She's not just mad at her father for abandoning her. She's mad at herself for still wanting him to be her dad.For wrestling fans, this movie will show you how harsh and brutal the lives of your favorite performers can be. For wrestling haters, this film will show you the brotherhood that exists in one of the world's last true carnivals and what it really means to stand in the ring and be the center of everyone's attention, even if it's just a few dozen people in a bingo hall.I imagine some people mistake Randy Robinson for some version of Hulk Hogan or even Randy 'Macho Man' Savage, but he's not. Those guys and others like them were smarter and more ambitious. They used wrestling as much as wrestling used them. No, Randy 'The Ram' is more like what Kerry Von Erich might have become if poor Kerry hadn't killed himself when he was still a relatively young man. Kerry's love of and need for wrestling was so profound and so twisted that even when doctors had to cut off his foot after a motorcycle accident, Kerry had a special prosthetic boot made so he could still get in the ring and perform. The story is that Kerry even showered with his boots on, so his fellow wrestlers wouldn't discover his infirmity. All Kerry Von Erich ever knew was pro wrestling and he couldn't even imagine anything else. Sometimes that level of devotion can lead a man to greatness. The Wrestler is about what happens when it doesn't.",9,0,0,21 October 2010
Inception," Steven Seagal+PhD+LSD = Inception
","Inception is takes the process of psychoanalysis and turns it into a visually spectacular, emotionally engaging and thought provoking action movie. If Steven Seagal got a PhD and then took LSD, it would be a little something like this film.In a world where the technology exists to enter the dreams of another person, the world of corporate espionage has moved into the imagination. Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an 'extractor', a man skilled in stepping into someone else's dreams and stealing their secrets. He is also an exile, forced to leave behind his country and his two children. A Japanese industrialist (Ken Watanabe) comes to Cobb with an offer. He asks Cobb for 'inception', to enter the dreams of another person and plant an idea so deeply and securely in their subconscious that it alters their very being. If Cobb can do it and cause a competitor (Cillian Murphy) to dissolve his corporation, the Japanese industrialist will have Cobb's exile lifted and allow him to return home.Cobb assembles a team for the mission. There's Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Cobb's button down right hand man to organize things. A 'forger' (Tom Hardy) who can change his appearance in dreams. A chemist (Dileep Rao) to concoct the sedatives to keep them asleep and dreaming. And a young woman named Ariadne (Ellen Page) who will serve as the architect of the dreamworld they will all enter, an unreal land of thought that will be filled with the subconscious projections of their target. But Ariadne learns something the rest of the team does not. The dreamworld will also be filled with the subconscious rage, guilt and self-hatred of Cobb, represented by the malevolent and destructive image of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). If Cobb cannot find a way to control his uncontrollable mind, he might doom them all.Inception is an excellent motion picture that succeeds as entertainment and as something more than that. With precise and measured performances, amazing special effects, explosive violence and a plot that functions on multiple levels of conflict, this is the rare big summer movie that doesn't disappoint.And despite what some may say, this isn't a difficult film to understand if you pay attention. Writer/director Christopher Nolan wants the audience to come along with him on this epic voyage and is careful to explain everything the viewer needs to know, which is also the one area of possible criticism of Inception. There is an awful lot of blunt exposition in the story, almost all of it coming from the words and deeds of Ariadne. She may be the architect within the storyline, but the character's true function is to tell the audience what's happened, what's happening and what's going to happen next. And it does get a little intrusive by the end of the movie because she does it so damn often.There's a bit too much to explain with Inception. Much as the Harvey Dent/Two-Face plot line was an additional boxcar on the end of the locomotive that was The Dark Knight, really not adding anything to the tale except making it longer, there're a few things in Inception that could and probably should have been pared down or away. It's all nice stuff to look at and think about but it's like eating too much chocolate cake. As much as you enjoy it, it's really better for you to stop before you're bursting at the seams. Considering how little most movies give you, it's somewhat ungrateful to complain about a surplus of sensation and conceptionbut there it is.Inception is probably the best made and most engrossing film of this year, many years in the past and many more to come. This is a must see.",8,0,9,12 January 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Hoping for a better sequel
","Much like the new Star Trek movie, Guy Ritchie's take on Sherlock Holmes breathes new, albeit imperfect, life into the master detective. Powered along by two energetic and engaging performances, this film is fun, funny and action-packedif a little ragged and unpolished.The plot concerns Holmes and Watson (Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law) taking on the mysterious and seemingly mystical Lord Blackwood (Mark Strong). After they catch Blackwood trying to sacrifice a young girl, Holmes and Watson see him die on the gallows. When Blackwood seemingly rises from the grave to continue his reign of terror in London, the world's greatest consulting detective and his stout companion must uncover the secrets behind Blackwood's magic and foil his sinister plan to take over the British Empire. Complicating matters is the friction between Holmes and Watson over the good doctor's impending engagement to Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly), which threatens to end their crime-fighting partnership, and the return of Holmes' old flame, the globe-trotting criminal Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams, who has her own agenda involving Lord Blackwood.Sherlock Holmes is one of those movies where the things that are good in it are really, really good. The best of those things is the superb job Robert Downey Jr. does in giving us a different but credible take on a legendary character. Downey's Holmes is far removed from the cool, almost disembodied intellect of previous incarnations. His is a brilliantly frazzled genius of loose ends and rough character. He's less Basil Rathbone and more Tom Baker, the fourth Doctor from the British TV series 'Doctor Who'. Jude Law is Downey's equal, transforming Dr. Watson from slow-witted sidekick into a pillar of strength on which Holmes relies. This Watson may not be as clever as Holmes, but he's his equal in every other respect.Downey and Law together are tremendous. Their chemistry as actors blossoms into their deep friendship as characters. This Holmes and Watson enjoy each others' company almost as much as they enjoy battling the forces of evil and it shows in everything they say and every move they make. Downey and Law could make a dozen more Sherlock Holmes films and they'd always be a treat to watch.Director Ritchie also gives us a visually charged look at Victorian London that manages to be interesting without recalling the processed unreality of the disastrous mess that was Will Smith's Wild Wild West movie. Ritchie may have supercharged the energy and pace of Victorian life to make it more palatable to the Age of Twitter, but he keeps things grounded enough to avoid looking ridiculous.Now, like the new Star Trek film, you don't have to look too hard to find quite a few flaws in this new version of Sherlock Holmes. The story is rather labored and when its mysteries are finally laid bare, you can't help but notice they're all closer to Scooby Doo than Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Rachel McAdams is also more a hindrance than a help to anything. She's a beautiful woman and a fine actress, but she doesn't have the natural sass and strength for this sort of role. Compared to the solid and sharp Kelly Reilly as Watson's future bride, McAdams seems limp and lifeless when matched against Downey. That Irene Adler looks to be about one-third the age of Sherlock Holmes is also kind of glaringly incongruous. This script, as well, does one of the most thick-fingering jobs of setting up a sequel that you'll ever see. In addition, Ritchie's direction is weirdly unsettled. A couple of his action scenes are nearly indecipherable and there are times it feels like he's fighting against the flow of his actors and their dialog.None of those problems change the fact that I like this movie. It's not perfect, but Sherlock Holmes is a damn sight better than the unadulterated crap that Hollywood too often spits out at us. It's fast without being frantic, light-hearted without being stupid and it's always working hard to try and entertain its audience. I hope Downey and Law get a chance to make a great Sherlock Holmes film. For now, I'm content with the good one they've already made.",7,1,2,11 October 2010
The Blind Side," It will reaffirm your faith in humanity. Seriously.
","The Blind Side is fairly unusual for an entertaining film in that it succeeds as much for what it doesn't do as for what it does. This movie could have become something truly, insultingly, patronizingly offensive. Instead, it became a wonderful tale of love and human decency.Based on a true story, it's about Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a gigantic and homeless black teenager who gets taken in by a rich white family, the Tuohy's, who turn his life around and help him become a great football player. Imagine what the old sitcom Different Strokes would have been like if little Arnold (Gary Coleman) had been 6'5'', 300 pounds and stoic and that's the basic idea of The Blind Side. Michael Oher is a good young man who is lifted out of a world of abandonment, poverty and crime. First because a football coach at a expensive private school wants Oher for the team and then because the wealthy Tuohy family opens their home and hearts to him.The primary angel in Oher's life is steely Southern belle Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), who brings him into her family. In the beginning, it's almost like Oher is a stray dog that Leigh Anne is taking pity on. She doesn't think through any of the consequences of what she's doing or where it's going to lead. Leigh Anne just sees someone in need and tries to help, never expecting it to result in her gaining a new, black and enormous son. Bullock is great here. It might be the best performance she's ever given or ever will give.Tim McGraw is also very good as Leigh Anne's husband. He's a little more practical about letting Oher into their lives, but knows he can't dissuade his fierce wife when she sets her mind on something. Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher also shines in a deceptively difficult role. Stumbling out of a world of emotional trauma, Oher is not at all an expressive or dynamic character. Quite realistically, he's impassive and somewhat willfully blank to the terrible things that have happened to him. Aaron manages to make him a genuine person and not a bad knock off of Lennie from 'Of Mice and Men'.The plot is very predictable but just manages to not insult the audience's intelligence. There's both some funny and poignant dialog and the direction has a very nice pace that neither hurries nor drags. Writer/director John Lee Hancock has taken a touching true story and made a touching motion picture out of it.However, whether it's based on real life or not, having a young black man essentially rescued from the horrors of the black underclass by some rich white folks raises a lot of uncomfortable questions. Questions about race. Questions about economics. Questions about education, opportunity, white guilt, black cultural dysfunction and the list goes on and on and on. It would have been extraordinarily easy for The Blind Side to be unwatchably smarmy, condescending, preachy, manipulative and squirmingly fake. It avoids any of that by avoiding asking any of those uncomfortable questions. Viewing this film will remind you such questions exist, but it neither offers any answers nor asks the audience to come up with any. This movie isn't trying to make any broader social point. It's just tells us about a time when some good people did the right thing because it was the right thing to do and it all worked out incredibly well.I liked The Blind Side a great deal and my mom liked it even more than I did. It'll make you glad you're a member of the human race, which is a pretty amazing thing.",9,0,3,7 September 2010
Prometheus," Somebody should have told these filmmakers there was an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation with this same premise.
","Well, that was disappointing. Not that Prometheus is such a bad film, particularly by summer blockbuster standards. It's just that the falloff from the idea 'Ridley Scott doing a prequel to Alien' to the finished product is so long and steep that it can't be ignored. I think we can all agree that it's better than the last two Alien movies (the Aliens vs. Predator ones don't count), but it doesn't come close to the first two in the series. As wonderful as it looks and as effective as some of its moments are, I think we can also agree that sometimes even the best directors and most gifted casts can't overcome thoroughly uninspired writing.The story features far too many characters with far too few defined roles and is stuck in between appealing to the audience intellectually and viscerally. The plot turns on the concept of aliens being the creators of humanity, which may have been daring when somebody first came up with it in sci-fi 40 or 50 years ago, but though it repeatedly poses the question of why they did it, nothing even vaguely resembling an answer is suggested. Then, with that unresolved query hanging in the air, a second question is posed of why would the alien creators of humanity now want to destroy it. Again, without even an allusion to a possible reason ever being offered. The script has aliens with the technology to travel the stars planning to destroy mankind not with death rays or anti-matter bombs, but with a bio-weapon so ludicrously elaborate that it had to have come from the laboratories of Rube Goldberg Industries. The ending is one of the least satisfying examples of sequel begging I've ever seen, made all the worse because I don't think Scott realized that's how it comes off.Michael Fassbender is quite good as the android David, though his performance apparently blinded everyone involved to the fact that his character's actions don't make any sense and his role in the story abruptly flips from pawn to villain to object of sympathy and back again. I have come to love Noomi Rapace and she's pitch perfect here as the script, again, fails to give her enough of a character to play. She's a scientist who came up with the whole alien creator theory and not only has to share that with another character, she and Fassbender have to take turns playing the moral center of the whole production. Charlize Theron is aboard as an evil corporate executive who never does anything all that evil and is reduced to cannon fodder by the end of the film.Prometheus is also a poor example of a prequel with Scott and screenwriters Jon Spaihts and Damon Lindelof going out of their way to leave a huge gap between where this movie ends and where Alien begins, to the point where there's room for another prequel or two. The impression I was left with is that Scott and company either started off with the plan of doing an Alien prequel or doing a sci-fi flick about the origins of Man and somewhere along the way the other notion got thrown into the mix and could never get pulled back out. With Alien and Aliens occupying two distinct genres, horror and action, perhaps the temptation of continuing the cycle with something more purely sci-fi was irresistible.Now, this movie is visually impressive and certainly never boring. It is intellectually and emotionally hollow. I mean, humanity's alien forefathers turn out to be giant albino bodybuilders who, rather than push a button and utilize some amazing piece of technology, prefer to beat and main their enemies with their bare hands?I hate to be so negative about Prometheus because it's better made and much more ambitious than your standard summer spectacle, but this is one of those cases where the storytelling might have been better and more enjoyable if it had been less ambitious. I wouldn't shoo anyone away from this motion picture because they might easily get a lot more out of it than I did. I can't recommend something, however, that flounders so badly on what it's trying to do and why it's trying to do it.",5,4,8,11 June 2012
The Queen," As spectacular a docu-drama as the genre ever gets
","A scrupulous docu-drama about how the death of Princess Diana elevated a newly elected prime minister and nearly devastated the British monarchy, The Queen does a wonderful job at fairly depicting the strengths and weaknesses of aristocratic privilege and democratic modernity. With a script that avoids all excess and sparkling performances by Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen, it's that rarest of all works of fiction - one that enlightens and well as entertains.Anyone old enough to remember the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Di also remembers the way her life ended in Paris, practically chased to death by the paparazzi. In the week after that tragedy, Great Britain was consumed in an orgy of public grief and a growing anger at a royal family that pointedly refused to join in the ostentatious mourning. This movie seeks to give a fair hearing to the much maligned royals, acknowledging the basic ridiculousness of a 20th century society willfully engaging in the mass delusion of treating an unelected, unappointed and factually powerless figurehead as if she were still important, while being fair to that figurehead and her family for the odd behavior their odder situation has cultivated in them.Deftly fusing together real news footage with re-enactments and dramatic inventions, The Queen is a brilliant blend of family turmoil, political maneuvering and social observation. It takes us inside the royal family and tries to demonstrate the peril and the promise of hereditary power. The Queen (Helen Mirren) is a shining example that when privilege is married to at least a sense of responsibility, it can produce someone quite impressive and worthy. When privilege is divorced from responsibility, we see the results in the seething arrogance of the Queen's husband, Philip (James Cromwell), and the sniveling weakness of her son, Prince Charles (Alex Jennings). Charles is actually the most fascinating character in the story, as it's subtly suggested that keeping him in subservient irrelevance for his entire adult life trapped him in a state of emotional adolescence.Prime Minister Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) is a man given power to reform British life and finds his first challenge is the daunting task of preserving the very heart of British tradition. In life, Princess Diana became a complicated woman with virtues and vices. In death, she became a secular saint which the public demanded the royal family bow down before. The fact that Diana had been a pain in the royal neck for many years didn't matter. The fact that such insistent wallowing in grief was overwrought and unseemly didn't matter. The people demanded and their supposed sovereign had to obey, something the movie makes clear the Queen should have understood herself.This is just a tremendous film with crackerjack writing and masterful direction that crystallizes a moment of history about as well as anything else in cinema. You should definitely watch this.",8,3,5,13 June 2011
X-Men: First Class," Fits perfectly well alongside the first two X-flicks
","The fairest things you can say about X-Men: First Class is that it is clearly at least the 3rd best X-film, it may be the best written movie that's ever credited 6 people for the story and screenplay and it is absolutely one of the best prequels that's ever been made. Those all sound like more backhanded compliments that I intend or this motion picture deserves, but they are the most accurate descriptions I can come up with.Set primarily in the early 1960s, the story concerns how Professor X (James McEvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) met and began their lifelong enmity over the place of mutants in human society. They're brought together by their pursuit of Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Magneto is after him for Shaw killing his mother and torturing him as a boy in a Nazi concentration camp. Professor X has allied himself with the CIA and is after Shaw to stop him from starting a nuclear war between the U.S. and the USSR, something Shaw thinks will destroy humanity and empower mutantkind. Each side assembles their own team, with shape-changing Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) among the good mutants and telepathic lingerie fan Emma Frost (January Jones) highlighting the bad guys.The Martin Luther King Jr. vs Malcolm X dynamic between Professor X and Magneto is blended with a plot and visual style straight out of a 1960s spy movie. Now, it's more like a really good Matt Helm flick than James Bond, but these filmmakers use that groovy look and sensibility to create one of the best representations of classic super-hero imagery without it feeling too 'comic booky'. By funneling super-hero tropes through the 60s spy genre, it almost effortlessly normalizes them without having to compromise them.The script juggles a big cast better than any other X-film and about as well as any action flick ever has. Yeah, most of them are cannon fodder or cardboard stand ins, but they're never obtrusive or annoying and they all orbit quite well around the quartet at the heart of the story. The mutant vs. human debate of Professor X and Magento is unfolded into an assimilation vs. racial pride standoff between Mystique and the Beast (Nicholas Hoult). The script even manages to expertly mirror its era by giving Magneto the revolutionary appeal of 1960s social turmoil, and casting Professor X as too weak and accommodating, which deliciously plays off the template of the first two X-films where Magneto was the aging radical still grasping at revolution while the Professor's approach had actually built something meaningful and lasting.The action scenes are good, though they become less effective as they become more overtly super-heroic. There are a couple of tremendous cameos. The continuity of the first two X-films is mostly respected and enhanced. And this movie finally resolves an argument that started with the original motion picture. Yes, Magneto's comic book helmet does look kind of goofy when you faithfully reproduce in the real world.First Class doesn't have the dramatic depth of X-Men or United, but it's a fun, funny and exciting summer experience. It's a shame the flaws of The Last Stand or Wolverine may have soured folks on mutant cinema and scared them away from this one but if you enjoyed the first two films at all, you should definitely give this one a look.",7,4,5,10 June 2011
The Wolverine," I feel sorry for Hugh Jackman
","The Wolverine is one of the better made super-hero flicks of its era. Screenwriters Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have come up with a story that's better than Spider-Man 1 or 3, Iron Man 2 or 3, either Hulk movie and both Captain America and Thor combined. Director James Mangold also does fine work, though many of the action scenes suffer from the modern blight of camera movement that's so frenetic you can barely tell who is hitting whom. The special effects are solid and even the soundtrack is well done. And the cast, highlighted by the tremendous Hugh Jackman, is as appealing as you'll find. There's almost every ingredient here you need to make a great motion picture. The one thing missing, however, is so important that it negates almost everything positive.Wolverine is not a great character. Yes, I know. He's the most popular comic book creation of the last 40 years and has joined, if not surpassed, Batman, Superman and Spider-Man in the hearts of super-hero fans. That's still doesn't change the fact that he's not a great character. Or to be more accurate, that's he's only a great character in the limited role for which he was originally conceived. Wolverine was created to be a one-off opponent for the Hulk and then was hauled out of mothballs to join a revamped X-Men roster and as a rebel anti-hero in opposition to or operating alongside more traditional heroic types, Logan is a whole lot of fun. On his own as the emotional and narrative heart of a story, he's a whole lot of one-note nothing.Wolverine is nothing more than adolescent badassery given form. He has none of the natural depth of Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne. Those characters are enmeshed with bigger concepts like responsibility, guilt, compulsion and myriad other things. Wolverine is about nothing more than looking, talking and acting 'cool' and every attempt to graft more onto him ultimately fails. This film ambitiously tries to build off both Logan's sense of loss from killing Jean Grey in X-Men: The Last Stand and his weariness over decades of battle-torn existence to give him some pathos, then strips him of his healing factor to try and make him slightly vulnerable. But adolescent badassery and vulnerability never mix and by the end of the movie, Logan is back to getting skewered through the chest by a katana and shrugging it off like it was a splinter. The super power that originally meant he could recover from a non-fatal gunshot in a day has metastasized into every boy's fantasy of never being hurt by anything.And if you think I'm wrong, ask yourself this. What are the best Wolverine moments on the big screen. They're all from the first two X-flicks, aren't they? Moments when he may have been the star but shared the screen and story with others. Or why did they need to go back to a 4 issue limited series from 30 years ago for the guts of this motion picture? No one wrote a Wolvie story-arc in the last 20 years that was good enough for the job?In many respects, this movie helps to solidify the standard of quality by which the whole genre should be judged. It really is that good in so many ways. But just because a comic book character is popular, that doesn't mean he or she can carry an entire film.",5,1,5,29 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Feels like it should have been the first movie after Batman Begins
","Let's get two things out of the way. There's nothing in The Dark Knight Rises that's even close to as memorable and compelling as Heath Ledger's Joker. This film also has nothing like the moral and thematic depth of The Dark Knight. This is much more like a direct sequel to Batman Begins, with the middle film of the trilogy existing on some separate and elevated plane.With that acknowledgmentis this movie any good? Yes, it's damn good. The Dark Knight Rises is probably the best plotted of all Nolan's Bat-flicks and makes tremendous use of its outstanding cast. True, it's a little long but Unlike The Dark Knight, where it felt like Nolan told an complete story about the Joker and then crammed a complete second movie about Two-Face into an additional half-hour tacked onto the end, this film feels and flows as a single narrative. That Nolan was able to seamlessly combine Batman, Catwoman, Bane and a new major supporting character with a continuation of the Ra's Al Guhl storyline from the first film, the 'Batman breaks his back' plot from the comics and, of all things, the No Man's Land crossover that nobody except fanboys remember from the 1990s, should make Sam Raimi and company hang their heads in shame even lower for Spider-Man III.8 years after the death of Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) and the disappearance of Batman, Gotham has become a city almost without organized crime because of a new law passed in the wake of Dent's demise that allowed more criminals to be locked up. Without his cape and cowl, Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a near recluse in Wayne Manor. Only a beautiful jewel thief named Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) is able to rouse Wayne from his apathy by stealing something from him. Not a string of pearls, though. She steals his fingerprints. At the same time, a masked mercenary named Bane (Tom Hardy) has entered Gotham's literal underworld with an agenda that starts with the personal ruin of Bruce Wayne and then extends farther than anyone imagines.Again, the plain truth is that this movie is a noticeable step down from The Dark Knight. That film was built on some profound questions about the nature of Man and the societies he creates. The Dark Knight Rises is about a larger-than-life supervillain and the desperate challenge he poses to our trusty heroes. Nolan does weave some commentary about the 'Occupy' movement vs. 'the 1%' into the tale, echoing the French Revolution if Robespierre had been a masked muscleman. And while Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are superb additions to the extremely gifted cast, they all pale next to Ledger's Clown Prince of Crime. This motion picture also fails to pick up the narrative baton from The Dark Knight and build upon what it said about Batman and the essence of super-heroism. Without either Ledger or Aaron Eckhart to draw on, it's almost as if Nolan shied away from an attempt for fear of tainting the tale already told.With some very good action sequences, a big new toy for Batman to play with and a good amount of humor, this movie is a fun time. Nolan even manages to stage and shoot a fight scene or two that look like more than random blurs on screen. I was honestly dubious going in as to the quality of this thing. It more than pleasantly surprised me.I'm not sure there's ever been another trilogy were the third film was better than the first, yet the 2nd was better than the other two put together. That's what Nolan has done. If you liked Batman Begins, you'll love The Dark Knight Rises. If you loved The Dark Knight, you'll still like this threequel. When the worst you can say about a film is that it's not as good as perhaps the best ever made in its genre, you know you're talking about something special.",7,5,10,23 July 2012
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," Another big budget sequel that falls short of the original
","This movie demonstrates the same thing winning the lottery sometimes does - you can't give some people money.This is the hugely disappointing sequel to the outstanding 'Elizabeth', which was largely the film that launched the American career of Cate Blanchett. Here she returns to the role of Queen Elizabeth I. It is 1585 and England finds itself under the threat of Spain, whose king (Jordi Molla) is a Catholic religious fanatic waiting only for an excuse to topple the Protestant Elizabeth from her throne. As the Queen's right hand man, Sir Francis Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), defends Elizabeth from plots at home and tries to find a politically advantageous husband for her and her country, Elizabeth's fancy settles on a privateer and explorer named Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen). Eventually a scheme involving Mary Queen of Scots (Samantha Morton) and Walsingham's own brother gives the Spanish king a justification for war and the Spanish Armada, the greatest fleet in human history, sets sail to conquer England in the name of God. Unless you're intellectually allergic to the subject of history, you probably know how that turned out.This isn't really that bad a movie. It's only mediocre or a bit worse. When judged against the quality of the first film, however, it is one of the worst sequels ever. We're talking Godfather III territory. 'Elizabeth' was a low budget film that took the idea of the historical epic and turned it on its head. It took one of the most important moments in British history, the ascension of Elizabeth to the throne, and made those important events merely the setting for a deeply personal tale of a young woman in a dangerous and conflicting circumstance. All the other elements of the story, political, religious and cultural were secondary to human joy, ambition and anguish of the woman who would become one of the greatest rulers in world history.'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' had a big budget, bigger stars and arguably focuses on an even more dramatic moment in the Queen's reign. But while the first movie subverted the concept of the historical epic, this movie fully embraces it. This is not the story of a woman, it's the story of a kingdom. And while Elizabeth may be the most significant character in the story, she isn't the most important. This story is really about the efforts of Francis Walsingham to defend his sovereign with deceit and strength. And it's about Charles Howard and Francis Drake, who actually led the British to victory over Spain's massive assembly of ships. Those men's actions may be in service to Elizabeth, but she's not directly involved in what they do.The movie tries on occasion to go back to what the first film did and let us see the pressures and inner pain of Elizabeth, but it never quite figures out what to do with her. The Queen is mostly a bystander for these events of history and for what is going on in this movie. Even in the love triangle of Elizabeth, Raleigh and the Queen's handmaiden Bess Throckmorton (Abbie Cornish), Blanchett has nothing to actually do but fuss and fume. Yet the attention of the story is so completely fixed on Elizabeth, that none of the other characters get the chance to live and breathe on screen.'Elizabeth' gave us a new and compelling look at the legendary monarch. 'Elizabeth: The Golden Age' tells the same sort of story about her that every other historical epic tells about every famous ruler. If you've never seen the first film, you may find this one passable. But if you haven't seen the first film, definitely rent it instead of this.",4,0,1,26 November 2010
The Producers," I love Zero Mostel
","Before it was a Broadway musical and before it was a movie based on that Broadway musical, The Producers was one of the boldest films of its era and remains damn funny after all these years. With a plethora of tremendously hilarious performances and one of the most jaw-droppingly mischievous premises you'll ever see, this film would have been the highlight of any other writer/director's career. Of course, Mel Brooks went on to do Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein, proving that there must be a God because only He could make someone that smart and talented.Not that Brooks did it all on his own. I mean, just take that opening scene between fallen-from-grace theater producer Max Bialystock and timid accountant Leo Bloom. It is astonishingly long, covers an unbelievable amount of dramatic ground and is stuffed with enough gags and shtick to choke elephant. No matter how great a director you might be, you can't pull off a scene like that with just any old actors. As wonderful as Gene Wilder is at soaring between the almost bi-polar extremes of Bloom, you can maybe imagine another guy in that role. If Peter Sellers had taken it, Leo would have certainly been different but potentially just as funny. But the number of men who could have pulled off the character of Bialystock besides Zero Mostel can probably be counted on the fingers of one hand after you've had a terrible accident with an industrial slicer. That Mostel is sporting one of the most catastrophic combovers in human history, yet reduces that by force of personality to just a little detail of the humanistic grandeur that is Max Bialystock, gets more amazing the more I think about it. That hairdo is all you'd remember with most actors. With Mostel, it just seemed normal.Since its revival on stage and then return to the silver screen, most folks have probably got a handle on the plot but you shouldn't overlook how well constructed is The Producers. With a lot of comedies, the plot is an excuse for humor that's ignored as much as it's followed. The way Brooks carefully builds this story, with one scene leading to the next and to the next, gives away the secret of his genius. Brooks is known for his broad and standard-changing subversive humor, but that's only the surface. Brooks is so good because he works so hard at getting the underlying dynamic right. The sequence where Bialystock is squiring Bloom about town, slowly seducing him into the life of a huckster and fraud, is so incredible because where the characters are and what they're doing is both rooted in and reflecting their individual natures. When Bloom gives in to temptation and goes running around that fountain, it's not just a great visual. It represents Bloom breaking through the boundaries of his old life and surging into something new. You don't even notice after that how the character isn't nearly as neurotic or brittle, because it makes perfect sense and feels absolutely right.And I'm not sure any other comedy has ever has three brilliantly over-the-top supporting performances like Dick Shawn, Kenneth Mars and Christopher Hewett. Even after so many decades and the roles being unmoored from their cultural milieu, you still can't help but laugh at them. You don't have to know anything about hippies or post-war Nazis or New York theater folk to enjoy such enthusiastic oddity.I will say, The Producers is one of those movies that makes you wish you had a time machine. As fantastic as it still is, think what it was like to be one of those people in 1968 who had never encountered something like 'Springtime for Hitler' before? There's no way the film can have that same bite in the early 21st century, but it remains a spectacular bit of work.",7,0,1,6 April 2012
RED," Sometimes you need to let the cast do the work
","Sometimes making an entertaining movie is no more complicated than having a good concept, a great cast and then getting out of the way. That's certainly the case with Red, which never tries to be anything more than a series of scenes that say 'Look at John Malkovich be funny! Look at Mary-Louise Parker be cute! Look at this cool stunt with Bruce Willis!' No, it's not a particularly elevated form of filmmaking but who gives a damn about that as long as it's fun? Director Robert Schwentke and writers Jon and Erich Hoeber, who adapted their script from the original comic book, keep things nice and simple. In both comedy and action, they set up and stick to a fairly consistent rhythm of set-up and punch line. It may seem uninspired but better that than falling into any of the gaping traps of trying to be too serious, edgy or pretentious in this kind of tale.Frank Moses (Bruce Willis) is a recently retired CIA operative who's spends his days puttering around his house and tearing up his pension checks so he has an excuse to call his customer service agent, Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker). T heir conversations have turned into pre-date flirting that both of them enjoy. Who knows where it would have led if a team of assassins hadn't tried to murder Frank in his home, sending him on the run and forcing him to abduct Sarah to keep her safe. As Frank tries to figure out who's trying to kill him, he assembles a team of old comrades who are also 'Retired - Extremely Dangerous' (John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman and Helen Mirren). Meanwhile, the CIA dispatches an assassin of their own (Karl Urban) to bring Frank down. What slowly unfolds is a conspiracy that reaches to almost the highest levels of government and forces some characters to question their allegiance.Red is an action-comedy that decides early on it's more about comedy than action and sticks to that through the whole film. From Mary-Louise Parker's frazzled woman who never expected the man of her dreams to tie her up and put duct tape over her mouth, to John Malkovich's paranoid sociopath who was right about the government being out to get him, to Helen Mirren and Brian Cox as starcrossed septuagenarian lovers, things are played for laughs rather than excitement or thrills. On the few occasions when the story gets close to dark moralizing about 'black ops' evils, it quickly pulls back into a more prankish attitude. Not that there aren't a few decent dust ups with the shooting and the punching and the exploding of stuff, but this movie is about as serious on spying as Ghostbusters was on the paranormal.The stars of the show are Parker, Mirren and Malkovich and kudos to Willis and Morgan Freeman for letting others steal the spotlight. Parker is completely adorable, even though she's reduced to a prop for a good bit of the end of the film. Mirren and Malkovich prove once again that when you're as good as they are, acting for the laugh can be just as compelling as the most dramatic of tear-drenched monologues.Moving at a good clip, the linear plot keeps both the jokes and the action scenes flowing and Willis' presence anchors the tone and keeps it from flying too far in one direction or the other. His use here is a great example of how 'movie star stature' can benefit a picture.Red is a mostly solid, funny and energetic little romp. If you haven't seen it, you should.",7,2,4,3 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Greatness
","You know what the dirty little secret about Star Wars is? It's a really frickin' great movie.I'm not entirely sure why that gets glossed over or ignored or disputed, but it does. Maybe it's because the prequels left a bad taste in everyone's mouth. Maybe it's because people feel something as commercially successful as Star Wars can't also have creative merit. Or maybe some people just resent the way the film fundamentally changed the movie industry. But I do think there are many people today who don't appreciate just how good this move is.For those of you just arriving Alpha Centauri, Star Wars is the story of young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a farm boy on a desert planet in a galaxy far, far away. Luke yearns to escape his small and simple life and run away to the stars. He gets his chance when two droids, R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), come into his life carrying the secret plans for a new superweapon constructed by the vile Empire. That's brings Luke to old Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness), a hermit who used to be a mighty Jedi Knight and is being called back to battle by the lovely Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) to help the Rebel Alliance defeat the Empire. Luke and Ben hook up with smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and his co-pliot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and they end up trying to rescue Princess Leia from the clutches of Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones), the evil Jedi who killed Luke's father, and racing against time to destroy the Empire's Death star before it can annihilate the Rebels.There are so many good things to Star Wars, but let's start with the well written characters and the good acting that brings them to life. Don't laugh. Luke is a whiny adolescent when the story begins who really isn't much of a hero. Even when Ben Kenobi offers him a chance to come with him on a great adventure, Luke declines because he doesn't want to be bothered with other peoples' problems. But as he grows into a hero willing to risk his life for what is right, Luke never stops being a kid. Alec Guinness does a fine job as Luke's mentor, giving a sense of serenity and grace to a role where he has to impressive enough to be believable as the man who changes Luke's life without overpowering Hamill's performance. Of course it is rather weird to rewatch Star Wars and recognize that the Obi-Wan Kenobi of this film doesn't really fit with the way the character was portrayed in the rest of the series.Carrie Fisher also has a tougher job than you might think. She had to make Leia tough and strong and commanding with a condescending sarcasm befitting a young woman who grew up fast in the world of galactic politics, while still being a beautiful princess for the audience to fall in love with. And Han Solo is actually more than just a rough around the edges rogue. Harrison Ford gives him a puffed up self-importance but let's us see that he's trying to impress himself as much as he is other people. He also has to be both not quite as smart as Luke but still show he's a bit wiser as to the ways of the universe.The movie is also better written than people realize. Luke starts out as a kid and doesn't magically morph into some super skilled warrior. For most of the story, the fighting is handled by the older, more experienced characters and Luke's contribution is coming up with some great ideas. It's really only at the end after going through all his experiences that Luke is ready to be a warrior himself. When Luke and company escape the Death Star, the script has enough confidence to not try and dumb things down. It realizes that it's far more believable for the Empire to let them escape, rather than pretend that 3 people, a wookie and a couple of droids could really shoot their way out of a moon-sized space station staffed by possibly millions of soldiers. But it doesn't just let the audience understand that, it let's the characters be smart enough to understand that.And of course, the writing of Star Wars can't be discussed with the subject of Greedo shooting first being addressed. In the original, Greedo is a hired thug who corners Han in the cantina and is about to kill him when Han blows him away with a hidden blaster under the table. In the special editions, George Lucas made Greedo shoot first and Han kill him in self-defense. A lot of fanboys have bitched about that and here's why it's important. While shooting him first from under the table is still arguably self-defense, it's a cold blooded and ruthless act. It's something that good guys, especially in 1977, don't do. With that act, the audience understands that Han isn't like Luke or Ben, that he'll do things that are unheroic. That tension in the character is what underlies his actions and his relationships with other characters throughout the film. It's the reason why you can believe he really is leaving just before the final battle, because you've already seen him do something like that. When Lucas made Greedo shoot first, he eliminates that moral dimension to Han Solo and he just becomes another hero in the story.Star Wars is the Babe Ruth of comics. Jaws may have been the first summer blockbuster, but this is the film that changed the way the game is played. The way movies are made, what movies are made and how they're marketed changed with this film. But its historical significance shouldn't blind people to its artistic greatness.",9,0,1,26 September 2010
Cube," It's like the Matrix, but not really.
","Cube is a smart little sci-fi thriller out of Canada that is sort of like a low-budget, stylistic half-cousin of The Matrix. That doesn't mean Cube features a lot of kung fu and slow motion special effects. It means that, like The Matrix, this movie tells a gripping and engrossing story which has a lot of philosophical and even theological themes running through it.Cube is about 6 people who wake up in the middle of a death-machine. It's a giant cube made up of individual square rooms. Some of the rooms are safe and some will kill you in horrible ways. These 6 people, who don't know how or why they were put into the cube, have to work together to find their way outif such a way even exists. It's a fairly basic plot but it's extremely well executed, leaving you never quite sure exactly what's coming.The meat of the story comes from the interactions of the 6 main characters and the larger social/cultural attitudes they represent. Rennes (Wayne Robson) is a hardened criminal and expert at escaping from prison who only cares about saving his own hide. Quentin (Maurice Dean Witt) is a cop whose aggression and determination both protects and imperils everyone around him. Leaven (Nicole de Boer) is a brilliant math student who mostly does what others tell her. Hollway (Nicky Guadagni) is a doctor and a leftist conspiracy theorist, always ready to blame the 'powers that be' for screwing up everything. Worth (David Hewlett) is an apathetic office worker, the sort of guy who stands apart and watches life pass him by and inside the cube, he'll just stand and watch death run right at him. Kazan (Andrew Miller) is a mentally handicapped man who tests the limits and value of the others' compassion. These 6 characters in this fantastic circumstance are forced to confront the truth about themselves and question everything they believed about their lives and their reality.In addition to the conflicts between the characters and the challenges they have to overcome, Cube also raises broader issues of personal action and the purpose of life. Is this death-machine the deliberate creation of some evil minds or is it simply an idea that ran out of control because no one was willing to take the responsibility of stopping it? Does the cube represent a social order imposed on us by others or it is the product of our own actions and inactions? Is there any aim to how the cube operates or is it all meaningless? Does the way you survive inside the cube say something about the way you should live your everyday life? Is the maker of the cube a 'benevolent god' trying to teach a lesson or a malevolent being who just wants others to suffer?There is uniformly fine acting by the cast, who all manage to give genuine human depth to archetypal roles. The dialog is direct without seeming contrived. The look and sound of the cube itself is tremendously impressive. Many films have spent a lot more money and not come up with anything as visually powerful and suggestive.This is a really entertaining, scary and thought-provoking movie. It's also similar to The Matrix in that Cube spawned two sequels, both of which seemingly didn't understand what made the first film so special and ended up sucking because of that. But no amount of lame ass sequels can take away from the fact that Cube is damn good.",8,0,1,10 September 2010
Easy A," Pretty good, as a long as you don't seriously compare it to John Hughes' 80s teen comedies
","This smart and charming film self-consciously invokes the John Hughes teen movies of the 1980s, but Easy A is a little too pat and plastic to rank alongside those classic flicks.Olive (Emma Stone) is the good girl nobody pays attention to in her high school, until the day she lies about having a date with a college guy to avoid spending the weekend with her inexplicable and insufferable best friend (Alyson Michalka). That lie eventually expands to include Olive having sex with the non-existent college guy, a fib that spreads like wildfire thanks to it being overheard by school Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes). Olive is both horrified at her new reputation and enticed by the attention her new identity brings her.Things get more complicated when closeted gay teen Brandon (Dan Byrd) asks Olive to pretend to have sex with him in order to convince the rest of the school he's straight and spare him any more homophobic torments. Olive agrees, and that leads to her becoming the pretend tramp for a string of school outcasts and losers, leaving Olive with a more and more scandalous reputation which she becomes more and more fond of.Eventually, the downside of being thought the class whore comes crashing down on Olive's life, forcing her to take to the internet to try and clear her namewhich always works so well in real life.Easy A is clever and fast-paced with an adorable star in Emma Stone and some funny supporting performances from Thomas Haden Church as Olive's favorite teacher and Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci and Olive's uninhibited and omni-supportive parents. It's a pleasant enough diversion but you can't ignore how the movie as a whole is about as thin as butcher's paper.Everything in this film is too perfect and too obvious and toowell, easy. Take Olive and her best friend as an example. As these characters are presented, it doesn't seem to make any sense that the girls would even hang out together, let alone be best friends. They don't have anything in common. The don't act the same, talk the same or think the same. The story simply needed Olive to have a best friend and these storytellers simply decided to make her as colorful as possible, without any thought as to how and why she fits with Olive. All of Easy A is like that, with pieces that stack one on top of the other like children's blocks instead of fitting together like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.It's a mild complaint about a good production, but it's a weakness that's highlighted by explicit references to John Hughes' teen movies filled with a messy humanity that's nowhere to be found in Easy A. It's like these filmmakers created something good and then convinced themselves it was much better than that.Easy A is an entertaining piece of work that no one's going to remember 20 years from now. If you demand more than that from a filmyou really need to get over yourself.",6,0,1,25 January 2011
Fantastic Four," One of the bad movies I actually like
","Hollywood has taken the classic comic book The Fantastic Four and made a great movie out of it. It's called The Incredibles. This official, big screen adaptation of the comic falls far, far short of being great. In fact, it's pretty crappy in most respects. As bad as it is, though, I still like its lighthearted tone and the few things about the FF that it gets almost precisely right.Born in the Cold War days of the space race, the Fantastic Four comic was about a brilliant scientist named Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud), his best friend and pilot Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), the woman Reed loves, and her kid brother Johnny (Chris Evans). The four of them defy government orders and sneak aboard a rocket ship to launch it into space, where they're bombarded by cosmic rays and are transformed into the stretchable Mr. Fantastic, super-strong and rock-like Thing and the more obviously descriptive Invisible Girl and Human Torch. The foursome band together to argue like cats and dogs while using their powers to protect humanity, most notably from the evil schemes of an Eastern European tyrant, scientist and sorcerer named Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon).To start with, this film butchers that origin about as badly as any super-hero origin has been butchered in movie history. Here, Reed is a financially strapped scientist who has to go to wealthy industrialist Victor Von Doom and ask for his help in conducting a science experiment involving an approaching cosmic storm. Sue and her brother Johnny work for Von Doom, with Sue even dating the guy while Reed, who was cold and forceful in the comics, is reduced to an insecure and socially awkward misfit who broke up with Sue years ago.They fly up to Von Doom's space station, get zapped by the cosmic storm and change into their super-powered forms, with Von Doom being included this time as a metalized version of the old Spider-Man villain Electro. Back on Earth, the Fantastic Four become a media sensation while Reed tries to work on curing their conditions. Reed and Sue grow closer as Von Doom is caught up in a stupid subplot involving the loss of his company. Eventually, Von Doom dons his traditional hood and metal face-plate and tries to destroy Reed and company. They fight. The end.I believe the background of this movie is that it was first intended to be a comedy, something like a super-hero version of The Addams Family or The Munsters, and some studio executives then demanded it be refashioned into a more stereotypical comic book adventure flick. If that isn't true, it should have been because that's what Fantastic Four is like. There's a whole lot of humor and fun with a few badly designed and badly pulled off action sequences sandwiched in at the beginning and end.Let's start with the good.Johnny Storm is may be the best ever big screen version of a comic book character. The rambunctious 60s teen who could burst into flames is recast as 20something hothead who's never met a risk he didn't want to take or a woman he didn't want to kiss. This irresponsible guy learning to be responsible is actually a big part of both this movie and its sequel.The tempestuous relationship between Johnny and Ben is also wonderfully captured here. The familial animosity between the two of them flows naturally and is the source of a lot of the movie's best laughs.The story also does a nice job of illustrating the pitiful plight of Ben. The idea of being remade into horrible monster was much more of a compelling concept for a super-hero a half century ago. In a world that's much more used to the grotesque, it doesn't quite sting as much. But the film finds little ways of emphasizing Ben's suffering that are almost touching.Fantastic Four also works hard at trying to be as much fun as possible, which is a nice break from so many other super-hero movie that treat everything so SERIOUSLY. There's something childlike and marvelously silly about the idea of people with costumes, code names and super-powers punching the forces of evil in the nose, and most super-hero movies move Heaven and Earth to squelch that sentiment. Where those films try so hard to be dramatic, this one goes for comedic and it's a nice chance of pace.Now for the bad.Reed Richards is a shlub, Sue Storm is a cypher and this movie aesthetically sodomizes Dr. Doom. He's turned into an utterly different and vastly inferior character. I can sort of understand why they thought they needed to change him. Countless sci-fi and fantasy storytellers have ripped off Dr. Doom to create their own bad guys and it might have been thought that the genuine article would have come off as derivative of his own copies. But if they didn't think Doom would work, they didn't need to jam him into this film. They could have used the Mole Man, Blastarr, the Skrulls or several other FF villains to do whatever evil-doing needed to be done.Fantastic Four really isn't a good movie, but it demonstrates yet again that being good and being entertaining are not the same thing. For all its faults, and they are legion, I still had a great time watching it.",5,1,5,25 October 2010
Jackie Brown," I pray this won't always be the third best Tarantino flick
","I haven't liked the last 3 movies by Quentin Tarantino. I loathed Kill Bill, was bored stiff by Death Proof and unimpressed by Inglorious Basterds. I was starting to wonder if I was being unfair. Perhaps my standards for Tarantino's work were too high and I was being overly critical. Then I rewatched Jackie Brown and remembered just how great Tarantino can be. This movie is so good it completely validates my view of how crappy everything he's done since has been.Based on a book by Elmore Leonard, this is probably the least showy and ostentatious of all Taratino's films, but it's also the one where he's most trying to grow and mature as a storyteller. It's about a loquacious and murderous gun dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who's set himself in inner city Los Angeles like a spider in a web. Ordell has women set up in houses all over town, an ex-con buddy named Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) helping him out and 500 thousand dollars stashed down in Mexico. To get access to his money, Ordell relies on an 40something flight attendant working the last airline job she'll ever have on the worst airline in the business. Her name is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier). When an ATF agent named Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) catches Jackie coming back into the country with drugs and an envelope filled with 50 thousand dollars, he gives her a simple choice. Go to jail and lose everything she has or turn on Ordell. It's a simple choice but Jackie Brown isn't a simple woman. With the aid of a bail bondsman named Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie hatches a scheme to get her out from under the cops, Ordell and her own run down life.This movie looks, feels, flows and even sounds different than anything else Quentin Tarantino has done. It dispenses with slick attitude and embraces and earthy and compromised reality. These characters are real people living real lives and when they talk, they say real things. They live in a world that looks lived in and unpolished. When these characters act, they don't do anything cutely clever or stylish but move and perform with a mesmerizingly plain directness. Jackie Brown is an effort by Tarantino to become more than the flashy shtick he executed so brilliantly in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. He's not trying to make that same sort of film again and he wonderfully succeeds.There's a lighter touch to the whole movie. The violence is less grotesque, the dialog is less contrived, the performances are less theatric and even the music that defines Tarantino's direction is less intrusive. Most of the songs we hear are a part of these characters' lives, not a soundtrack slathered over them.Now, that does also mean that Jackie Brown doesn't have quite the energy or intensity of Tarantino's previous work and the pacing of the story is maybe a bit too luxurious. But there are no serious flaws to the movie. There's nothing in here you have to overlook or excuse. There's never a point or a moment that you have to accept that you wouldn't accept if you saw it in the work of a lesser filmmaker.The performances here are uniformly strong with the actors filling out the depth of each and every character. None of these roles are just here to serve The Almighty Plot Hammer. They do what they do because of who they are.Jackie Brown is a really good film. Sadly, though, I fear that when Tarantino's career is overJackie Brown will still be the third best movie he ever made. True, that would mean he made three films that were better than most people ever make. It would also mean he spent decades throwing away one of the greatest talents of his time.",8,0,1,29 August 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Not the best Star Wars movie
","You know what the dirty little secret about The Empire Strikes Back is? While many people would claim this is the best Star Wars movie, it really isn'tand it isn't even close.Which doesn't mean Empire isn't a great film. The last 25 minutes or so are as good as anything in Star Wars and there's plenty before that to keep you entertained. But I think folks get caught up in how much bigger, bolder and darker this sequel is compared to the first movie and don't notice the little cracks that run throughout the story.Empire picks up the story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the rebellion against the Empire at least a few years after the events of Star Wars. The rebels have just settled in to a new secret base when Luke gets bushwacked by a snow monster and sees an image of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Dagobah system and be trained by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). A probe droid leads the Empire to the Rebel base and after a big battle, Luke sets off for Dagobah while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and company get trapped by the Empire and eventually have to flee to Cloud City, where Han's old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) will help them repair the Millennium Falcon and hide from the Empire. As Luke trains, we learn that Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones) is desperate to find Luke and considers his Jedi potential to be extremely valuable or extremely dangerous to the Empire. Vader eventually lures Luke to Cloud City, where we get one of the all time great revelations in movie history, and witness our heroes battle to survive.Empire is definitely a bigger film than Star Wars. There's far more action on a much grander scale with more speed and thrills. But a lot of the big effects in Empire have not aged that well. Watching Empire, you can sort of understand how George Lucas became obsessed with going back and fixing things in the original trilogy.This is also one of the boldest movie blockbusters ever. The story is basically about how our heroes fail over and over and over again and barely escape by the skin of their teeth. And these are real failures, where Luke and Han aren't smart enough or strong enough or good enough to succeed, not flukes or situations where winning is impossible. Empire is very much about how the characters we loved from the first movie fall short and get beaten down.Which is one of the things that make it much darker than Star Wars or any other SW movie, except perhaps Revenge of the Sith. But that's not all. Star Wars was largely the story of Luke Skywalker growing from a boy to a man, but in a triumphant, cheerful, fairy tale sort of way. It's a hero's story. Empire is also about a boy becoming a man, but not in triumph. This is a story about Luke becoming an adult and learning that the world doesn't work the way children think it does. This is a story of lost innocence.Empire is a great movie and I don't want to overly criticize it, but you can see some basic problems compared to Star Wars. It doesn't really have a central plot propelling things along. For a big budget sci-fi spectacle, Empire is rather like one of those art house films where stuff just happens to the characters. The story also breaks up the Luke/Leia/Han triangle suggested in Star Wars and leaves Leia with little to do in this film other than be the foil for Han's amorous advances. And while the story is more adult in some ways, it's also simpler. There was a lot of stuff in Star Wars that suggested a wider universe in which that particular story was only a part. Empire shrinks everything down and links everything together in a much less sophisticated way. Darth Vader also becomes almost cartoonishly evil in Empire after having a core of believability in Star Wars. Although, the story does do a good job of illustrating how being that evil is ultimately self-defeating. And there's a lot of little comedic bits crammed into the story, with most of it C-3PO related. It's not as bad a Jar Jar Binks, but it's a step down that road.One of the other striking things about Empire is seeing puppet Yoda again after getting used to CGI created characters. There's no denying that while puppet Yoda looked great in 1980, now he really looks fake. But puppet Yoda actually seems more alive than the CGI Yoda of the prequels. Puppet Yoda looks fake but feels real, while CGI Yoda looks real but feels fake. It think it must be because puppet Yoda was mostly the creation of a single artist, allowing his talent and personality to shine through, while CGI Yoda was a product that was sort of manufactured by a large team.A lot of people say Empire was as good as it was because people other than George Lucas played such a big role in making it. But noticing the weaknesses in Empire really only emphasizes how great a job Lucas did in Star Warswhich also emphasizes how poorly he did when it came to making the prequels.",8,0,1,17 September 2010
Sin City," Proves why fidelity to the source material is not always a good quality in movie adaptations
","If what you want is something relentlessly faithful to the source material, Sin City is THE movie for you. If what you want is a good film, Sin City is an amateurish mess.Based on the comic books by Frank Miller and yes, most of them are comic books not graphic novels, this movie takes three Sin City tales and compresses them into one interwoven film. Mickey Rourke is Marv, a superhumanly tough thug out to avenge the death of a beautiful woman murdered next to him in bed. Bruce Willis is Hartigan, a superhumanly tough senior citizen cop out to protect a beautiful girl from the sick bastard who wants to kill her. Clive Owen is Dwight, a superhumanly tough guy hiding from his past and out to protect beautiful prostitutes from a rogue cop named Jack Rafferty (Benicio Del Toro) and the mob that wants to bring the women back into their control. If you're noticing a bit of similarity between those three stories, you're on the right track.What's good - Dwight having an imaginary conversation with a corpse in a car, Mickey Rourke as Marv and a topless Carla Gugino.What's bad - The dialog is painfully stilted and stifling. Words that burn the page when linked to a single image weigh the film down like lead when spoken by actors in real-time. It's like a Shakespeare play where the characters give these long speeches and the actors have to figure out what to do while they keep talking. But while the rhythm of the Bard's words gives the actors something to hang their performances on, the repetitive Spillane-speak of Sin City traps the actors amber.Color is splashed haphazardly throughout the film, to the point that when you finally get to That Yellow Bastard...instead of being a disturbingly creepy image, he's just another theatrical effect. Maybe there was some design to the way color was used, but I can't detect it and it all just becomes distracting with usually no reason why something is in color or why it shifts from black-and-white to rainbow and back.Cramming several Sin City stories together also highlights the sameness of the adolescent nihilism that runs through them. The one note that Miller played so beautifully in the books is pounded into your brain over and over again.I call it an amateurish mess, even with the talent and skill of Rodriguez and Tarantino, because just as some comic creators today refuse to utilize the full capabilities of the word and picture, Sin City abandons or rejects some of the basic things a motion picture can do. Comic and Film are two different mediums and you cannot tell the same story in each in the exact same way.It is very visually stylized, and if that's your thing it might make up for the storytelling weaknesses of the film. If not, you'll come away wondering what all the fuss is about.I may be a little too hard on Sin City, the movie. It may be fine as an abnormally violent, visually indulgent crime picture. But because it is almost a literal translation, it ends up being nothing like the cinematic equivalent of Miller's brilliant work.",4,1,5,12 October 2010
Moon," A powerful story and a masterful performance combine in a sci-fi classic
","Moon is not just a smart movie. It's a movie that asks you to be smarter. Science fiction is one of the more bastardized genres in cinema, with about a jillion action movies with ray guns and monsters passing themselves off as sci fi. The essence of science fiction, though, is right there in the name. It's fiction that uses science and technology to illuminate human thought, deed and morality. Moon is as true to that ideal as any work of Bradbury, Asimov or Heinlein.Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is an astronaut. Well, he's not so much an astronaut as he is the caretaker of an automated mining camp on the far side of the moon. As machines that look like lunar combines harvest moon rock as a source of energy, Sam ventures out on his moon buggy to collect the full canisters of Helium 3 to ship back to Earth. As the story opens, Sam is finishing up his 3 year contract at the mining camp. He's the only human on the moon and, due to satellite trouble, he can't even have direct communication with anyone else. His only companion is GERTY (Kevin Spacey), sort of a tripartite version of HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey, one that comes with changeable emoticons.One day, as Sam is heading out to collect the Helium 3 from a harvester, he thinks he sees someone out on the surface of the moon. Distracted, Sam crashes his buggy into the much larger harvester and passes out. He awakes in the infirmary, GERTY watching over him, with no memory of how he got there. When he finds out and how he finds out will change Sam's lives forever. And no, that's not a typo. I mean 'lives'.This is an exquisite and challenging production, highlighted by a masterful and yet understated performance by Sam Rockwell. It looks great and never feels contrived. When it begins, you're not sure what kind of tale is going to be told and when Moon introduces its mystery, the film willfully refuses to answer the immediate questions that spring to mind. Not because those questions aren't anticipated and eventually answered, but because this movie wants you to think beyond technical details and focus on more profound thoughts. This is a story about human identity and human decency and whether changing the meaning of human alters either identity or decency. Moon makes no judgments itself. It demands viewers make judgments for themselves.Like most smart films, Moon allows the audience to figure stuff out. In fact, a couple of the most touching and wrenching aspects of this story are things of which Sam Bell seems oblivious. It's poignant to understand something about a person which they don't understand about themselves, and Sam Bell manages to be a person and not a character. This is a physically and mentally demanding role that Rockwell makes completely his own.In addition to being excellently made and both intellectually and emotionally engaging, Moon is also a subtle and chilling indictment of the capitalist drive for exploitation and the unconsidered consequences of enriching oneself at the expense of another.Moon is a great film.

The Runaways," Okay but nothing special
","Though it's named after and supposedly about the groundbreaking all-girl rock band of the 1970s, a more accurate title and description of this film would be 'The Rise and Fall of Cherie Currie, guest starring Joan Jett and with a special appearance by Kim Fowley'. They just took the story Currie wrote in her book about her life, sandwiched in some stuff with Jett and let Michael Shannon tear the scenery apart with his bare teeth. If you wanted to look back through the decades and know who The Runaways were and why they were important, this movie will only give you a glimmer of a clue. Maybe they were so much of their moment that you can't really appreciate them if you weren't there at the time. The fact remains this motion picture doesn't tell you anything you can't see on any one of a hundred 'Behind the Music' shows on VH-1.With that, however, The Runaways is still a satisfactory little flick. Kristen Stewart is great, as always, and Michael Shannon is out the door, down the street, into your home and having sex with your mother as The Runaways' almost Nietzchian record producer. Dakota Fanning is reel purty but isn't asked to do much besides glower or look forlorn. The musical sequences are quite good and there are a couple of moments when writer/director Floria Sigismondi does an excellent job visually projecting what it's like to be inside the cyclone of sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. The movie also touches on the sexism the group had to endure and combat, but only in the most clichéd and hackneyed of ways. As rock bio-pics go, there sure have been a lot worse than this.What keeps it from being any better is that Cherie Currie's story dominates the movie and it simply isn't that interesting. She's a 15 year old with looks and attitude who got plucked from obscurity to be the band's lead singer, couldn't handle the hard life of being a rock star and crashed back to reality. Joan Jett's tale of ambition and determination takes a decided back seat and the other members of The Runaways can be entirely described as 'the jealous one', 'the lesbian one' and 'the one who barely has any lines and might as well be a mic stand'. The best parts are when Shannon's Kim Fowley is completely blunt and ruthless in the molding of these girls young enough to be his daughters into icons of rock, but that largely disappears for the 2nd half of the film. The most intriguing part is how Cherie's older sister Marie (Riley Keough) transforms herself into a mirror image of her little sis. That image suggests so much but none of it is ever explored.If every member of the band had been given a fair share of the narrative and it had focused more on the struggles between The Runaways and Fowley and between them and the rest of the world, I can't help but think that would have been a much more compelling story. Especially because the look of the movie is outstanding in how it captures the zeitgeist of the 1970s. I'm not sure any character's appearance has better symbolized that era of cultural decadence and stylistic chaos than Fowley's.If you're a fan of this group, this genre or this time period, you'll probably enjoy The Runaways. Nobody else needs to rush out and watch it, but there's no reason anyone shouldn't give it a look.",5,1,4,5 April 2012
The Birds," A bit dated in spots, but still better than 90% of movies made today.
","This is one of the best films from one of the greatest filmmakers in movie history. It's not a perfect movie and parts of it do show their age, but the countless inferior horror stories in the same vein that followed The Birds testify to its exceptional quality.Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) is like a Bizarro Paris Hilton. She's a rich man's daughter who doesn't think the rules of society apply to her. But unlike the debauchery and narcissistic self-promotion of Miss Hilton, Melanie Daniels is the sort of outrageous débutante that makes life more interesting. She's smart and bold and playful and uses her wealth and privilege to do things that normal people can't do, even though many of them wish they could. For example, after being taken to task one day by the charmingly arrogant Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), Melanie decides to take a day out of her life to drive up from San Francisco to tiny Bodega Bay with a pair of lovebirds, just to tweak this almost unknown man and let him know he didn't get one up on her.Melanie doesn't get to have the last word and walk away, however. She meets Mitch's little sister Cathy (Veronica Cartwright) and his brittle mother Lydia (Jessica Tandy). Lydia clings to Mitch like her rock in a raging sea and sees Melanie as a hammer that might break that rock out from under her. Melanie also encounters Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette), the local school teacher who views the rich, worldly and more liberated Melanie the way a fisherwoman might view a storm on the horizon. She's also a woman who was in love with Mitch, but their romance couldn't withstand the cold opposition of Lydia.While The Birds is still unsettling and full of powerful images and sharp, intelligent dialog, the most striking thing about it is that the relationship between Mitch, Melanie, Annie and Lydia could have been the core of a completely different kind of movie. You can easily imagine Hitchcock plunging these characters into his more traditional tale of mystery and murder. That's not what happens, though. Mitch, Melanie, Annie and Lydia, along with the villagers of Bodega Bay, find themselves caught up in an insane rebellion of nature. Birds begin attacking the people of Bodega Bay. First one at a time, and then thousands of them descend on the town in waves of blood and terror until it's not clear is anyone at all will survive.The Birds is a tremendous bit of work, but I don't think there's any need to pretend about it as a story and a film. Though Hitchcock uses real birds to eerie effect, the 1963 special effects don't hold up very well. It's also true that to an audience that grew up with Jaws, Alien and Jurassic Park, the idea of murderous flocks of birds isn't quite as shocking or scary as it once might have been. Though it still has powerful moments, most modern viewers are going to be a bit jaded to some of the thrills this movie throws at them.Those little chinks in The Birds' armor can't detract from the otherwise superb writing, direction and performances in the film. Tippi Hedren is gorgeous and magnetic. Suzanne Pleshette is strong and sexy and actually speaks with a sultry female tone and not the sound of sandpaper on a wet possum. Rod Taylor carries off the less formed role of the slightly dickish Mitch Brenner with the verve of an old time movie star. Jessica Tandy takes a character that could have been hateful and barren and gives her human depth. And while I'm not sure pop culture remembers, there are scenes and moments in The Birds that are as visually compelling as anything Hitchcock ever did.Hitchcock is one of those filmmakers you have to watch. The Birds is one of those Hitchcock films you have to see. Do yourself a favor and rent it.",7,1,4,8 September 2010
Evil Dead II," The essence of Raimi
","All artists change over time. Their evolution reflects their own personal growth, the development of their skills and the different influences that pass through their lives. If an artist is lucky, they'll produce a work that is uniquely their own. Something that embodies the purity of their own thought and feeling, without being too constricted by external forces or degenerately self indulgent. Evil Dead II is Sam Raimi's unique contribution to the common aesthetic.I realize that seems a bit pretentious when focused on a horror movie where a corpse dances, a man cuts off his demon-infested hand and a woman swallows a witch's eyeballbut it's true. Evil Dead II is the most honest, purest expression of his own vision. It's the thing that from start to finish, only Raimi could have made. The fact that it's a remake is what's so unusual.Evil Dead II isn't a sequel to Evil Dead, it's a retelling of the same story but freed from the expectations of others. Both films tell the story of a group of people in an isolated cabin with the infamous Necronomicon, the Book of the Dead. Both films feature unclean spirits summoned back into the world by words played from a tape machine. Both movies even feature a young woman who runs into the haunted woods and is molested by devilish shrubbery and the main character in both is a young man named Ash (Bruce Campbell). But there is a profound difference between the two films.Evil Dead has a great many startling and bizarre elements to it, but it is essentially a conventional horror movie. When he made it, Raimi was making what other people had told him made a movie a horror movie. It has the same dynamic and the same essential nature as other horror movies. When he made Evil Dead II, Raimi made what he thought a horror movie should be. And what Raimi thought a horror movie should be is Man facing terrifying eviland surpassing it.Evil Dead II embraces the idea that the grotesque is both frightening and silly. That the proper response to the most extreme situations, circumstances where reality itself is out to get youwould look goofy. Raimi's vision was that terror taken to the otherworldly limit would be not even a hair's breadth away from silly. That's what makes Ash one of the great characters in film. Unlike others in horror films, who represent the audience desperately clinging to the real and the safe, Ash is confronted with the outrageous and the insane and he's right there with it all, step for step and crazed laugh for crazed laugh. Oh, he's frightened and he's frantic and he's jumping at shadows. But Ash doesn't reject the horror before and around him. He dives into it. He fights with it, not against it. What Ash represents is the idea that the indescribable nightmare out there isn't really 'out' there. We're part of it and it is in acknowledging and accepting that, we can defeat it. What defines Evil Dead II are those moments where Ash is even more inhuman than the hellish monsters in those dark woods.By the time he did the third film in the series, Army of Darkness, Raimi had lost his purity of vision. There are only moments of the film that are at all scary. Ash become a figure of comedy in a world of laughably over-the-top creatures and situations. If Evil Dead was Raimi making what other people thought a horror movie was, Army of Darkness is Raimi making what other people thought a Sam Raimi movie was. It has all of the style but none of the heart.Which isn't to say it's a bad film. All three are enjoyable on their own merits, like many of Raimi's other works. Evil Dead II stands out, though, because it wasn't made by Sam Raimi. It is Sam Raimi.",8,1,2,16 September 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," A good film that could have been great, with a puzzlingly bad ending
","Law Abiding Citizen is a pretty good movie, right up until the end when it regresses like a 50 year old man going through a midlife crisis. After establishing itself as a provocative and fairly intelligent thriller, the film concludes with all the depth and nuance of a bad 80s action flick. It's almost as though this story was originally conceived as a 6 hour miniseries for television but then it was turned into a big screen project and some doltish studio executive arbitrarily ended it after what would have been the first episode.The film opens with a vicious home invasion where Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) witnesses the murder of his wife and daughter. The killers are caught but when the DNA evidence is tossed out on a technicality, prosecutor Nick Rice (Jaime Foxx) decides to make a deal. The man who actually did the killing agrees to testify against his partner, sending him to death row while receiving only 5 years in prison. Clyde begs Nick not to do it. Nick, however, cares more about maintaining his high conviction rate than about Clyde's slain family. 10 years after that fateful decision, Clyde returns and launches a brutal string of murders to teach Nick and the whole world a few lessons about the true meanings of justice and responsibility.The only complaint I have about the first 3/4 of Law Abiding Citizen is that the pacing is a bit lax. Director F. Gary Gray does a poor job of creating a sense of constantly rising tension and danger. Outside of that, this is a smart and surprising story that engages both the head and the heart. It asks a series of compelling questions about the morality and ethics of our criminal justice system and the personal accountability of those who work in that system.Unfortunately, the last quarter of this movie is dumb. I mean, really dumb. I'm talking about 'guys who think strippers really like them' dumb. None of the ethical questions posed or moral dilemmas presented in the first three-quarters of the movie are resolved or even acknowledged by the conclusion. The arguments it advances are suddenly short-circuited, seemingly just so something can get blown up real good. It's like a chess match that ends with someone getting a pie thrown in their face. I don't know if there came a point where writer Kurt Wimmer realized that he didn't have any answers to the philosophical questions he was asking in this script, if he was afraid of answering them or if someone didn't like his answers, so they were removed and a hunk of insultingly cheap and callow crap was inserted in their place. All I know is that the more you like this movie, the more disappointed you'll be in the ending.Acting wise, Gerard Butler does some fine work here. He plays Clyde Shelton as a man consumed by a cold rage and an unshakable determination to make everyone else understand why he's angry. He never lets the character lapse into easy insanity, nor does he try too hard to make him sympathetic. His performance embodies the challenge the story presents to the sensibility of viewers. This is a film that actually wants you to think about things.The rest of the cast isn't called on to do nearly as much as Butler but they're all perfectly adequate. Except for Jaime Foxx. He's basically terrible. He gives Nick Rice none of the depth or complexity that Butler grants to Shelton. Foxx looks like he only wanted a paycheck and fakes his way through the role without ever thinking about who Nick Rick really is or what he does. It's like his agent told him he's the hero in the movie and that's all the preparation Foxx did for the job. As good as Butler is, the fact that he gets nothing back from Foxx in their scenes together does prevent Law Abiding Citizen from being as good as it might have been, even with its lobotomy of a finish.I don't know what went wrong with the conclusion of this film. But even as bad and unsatisfying as it is, the rest of the movie is still good enough to recommend. After about 90 minutes, you might be better off walking out of the theater and making up your own ending in your head. I can guarantee that it'll be better than what you'd see on the screen.",6,1,2,24 September 2010
Up in the Air," Simplistic but very entertaining
","Up In The Air is one of those movies where the parts are much better than the whole. It has a lot of pieces of good-to-great storytelling, but none of it adds up to anything at the end. This film is like a lovely house that's been perfectly painted, expect the painters weren't paying close enough attention and each side of the house is a different color. Each side looks great on its own but when you step back and look at the whole house, the overall affect is unsatisfying.Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) is a modern nomad, living out of hotel rooms and his travel case as he flies from city to city, firing people when their own bosses don't have the stomach for it. What would be a hellish existence for many people is a joy to Ryan. He's so happy living his life constantly in motion and unencumbered that he's built up a side business giving corporate speeches on 'emptying out the backpack of your life' and freeing yourself from the demands of both possessions and relationships. Ryan's even managed to land himself a pseudo-girlfriend in the smart and sexy Alex (Vera Farmiga), another constant business traveler who hooks up with Ryan at various hotels whenever their schedules coincide.Ryan gets thrown for a loop, however, when his bosses decide to stop sending him all over the country to fire people and just do it over the internet. At least that's the plan put forth by Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick), the very young and very smart new girl at Ryan's company. Feeling that his perfect life is threatened, Ryan pokes enough holes in Natalie's proposals that he's assigned to take her out on the road and teach her the basics of the termination business. As Natalie learns that taking away people's jobs is a bit more involved than she thought, Ryan begins to reconsider his unattached reality. But just as he decides that maybe life is better lived with others, he's staggered by a series of surprises and challenges that leave him right where he was at the start of the filmbut with a completely different outlook on things.There's a lot to love about Up In The Air. George Clooney is as charming as ever and he has his equal in Vera Farmiga. Their characters are wonderful together and both performers look like they're having a lot of fun. They could have made a really nice romantic-comedy about Ryan and Vera just by themselves. Anna Kendrick as the professionally and personally naïve Natalie is a great prism through which the strengths and weaknesses of Ryan and Vera's lifestyle can be seen and examined. Being the third wheel in a script in never an easy role, but Natalie is more than a servant to the Almighty Plot Hammer.The film's examination of what it means to people when they lose their job is also a welcome perspective. The wrenching, defeating and humiliating experience of being fired is conveyed through real people who were actually laid off, talking to the camera as through they were speaking to the person who fired them. Into that genuine pain, the fictional character of Ryan is introduced and he is exactly the sort of person you'd want to be the one telling you you're out of a job. Ryan talks to these people about how losing their job is an opportunity to do something better with their lives. And here's the important thing, the movie shows us that both Ryan and the people he's firing know that the 'opportunity spiel' is a load of BS...but that in that BS is a kernel of truth. All Ryan can offer is cold comfort and he truly wants it to be the best comfort he can offer, but he also maintains a professional distance. He's like a surgeon who's performing a dangerous but necessary operation and can't let the death of a patient emotionally derail him and stop him from doing his job.For all of the good, though, Up In The Air crashes and burns at the end when you realize there's not been a point to anything you've just watched. You can literally boil down the entire dramatic and thematic core of this movie into two sentences. They are1. A man who doesn't want personal relationships changes his mind and wants personal relationships.2. The End.I'm not joking. All the humor and social observation in the rest of the film is nothing but decoration for that simplistic and ungratifying gist. This isn't a story about how there's something wrong with Ryan that made him choose a disconnected and solitary existence. Ryan is shown as being perfectly capable of having meaningful relationships. He just starts out not wanting any and then he does. This also isn't a story about how there's something wrong with Ryan's lifestyle, other than that it's unusual for someone his age to enjoy such a peripatetic state of being. It isn't even a story about something being wrong with Ryan's job. There really is no overarching or unifying argument underlying this story. That's not the worst flaw in the world, but it results in an quite entertaining movie finishing in a very unsatisfactory way. When it ended, I felt like there should have been another 15 or 20 minutes left in the film.Because these filmmakers apparently never considered what this movie was supposed to be about, the audience is left to relish the individual parts of the film without them ever fitting together in any greater way. I like everything about Up In The Air, right up until it left me disappointed and a bit confused. That's a lot more pleasure than you'll get out of most movies, so I can certainly recommend this film. Just don't expect it to make a lot of sense.",6,3,5,27 December 2010
