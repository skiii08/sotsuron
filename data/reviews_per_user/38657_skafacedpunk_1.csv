The Ring," ive got a couple questions... some spoilers in here...
","ok, theres 2 things that have been bugging me about the film, and i wanted to know if anyone knew the answers to them, or could just help me to further understand.1)  ok... if rachel wasnt going to die, since she made the copy of the tape, why did she continue to go through the symptoms long after noah viewed it? its a bit of a tease, and quite confusing, since everyone thinks shes going to die... i mean, i guess its supposed to 'keep us guessing' until the end, but its almost contradictory since shes being lead on that shes going to die... but then doesnt.  just bugged me.AND2)  another thing... how did samora get that stuff on tape?  they were her thoughts right???  so how did her thoughts transfer onto a tape for everyone to see?... im not so much bothered by the phone calls and her talking from the grave... or the fact that she didnt say anything... and im not even confused by how she killed people... those things all made sense to me. i was just really confused by how she got that stuff on tape.maybe the sequel that is apparently coming out will answer these questions, but that probably wont be for awhile... so if anyone could help me with these, id appreciate it.",Null,0,0,13 December 2002
