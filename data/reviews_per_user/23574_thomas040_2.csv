Men in Black 3," A MAJOR plot hole
","So I liked the film and was mildly entertained, although it was slow at places ... but one HUGE thing bothered me throughout ...How was it that EVERYONE else EXCEPT J didn't remember K being alive? I mean, the time line skewed into a tangent since Boris went back in time and killed K. How come J (Will Smith) still remembered him, or even worked for MiB since it was K that recruited him post death. Makes no sense to me.There's a scene where he's about to time jump where he asks the radio shack guy how that can be ... but there's never an answer to that question?",7,3,7,25 May 2012
Mission: Impossible III," Impossible to be bored
","This movie is so intense from beginning to end, it's impossible to watch it and have one minute where you are even bordering close to anything that resembles boredom.I greatly enjoy this movie, and have watched a few times now, and still marvel at how amazing it's executed. Great acting from both Tom Cruise (which I normally think is annoying), and Hoffman. The plot is constantly moving forward due to all the action scenes, which have great variety. Music, editing, and writing of the script is superb. Highly recommendable.I give it 8 out of 10. Go watch it.",9,0,1,28 December 2008
