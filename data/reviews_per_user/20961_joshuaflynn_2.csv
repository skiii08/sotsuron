The Avengers," Superhero movie at it's best!
","Wow, I've just seen this film in the cinemas and I am blown away. This is easily one of the best superhero film I have seen. It has everything you would want; Great action, good acting, superb special-effects and extremely good interaction between the characters. I won't give anything away but the interaction between The Hulk and Thor is hilarious, especially near to the end of the film. Chris Evans is great as Captain America, Mark Ruffalo is good as the calm Hulk, Chris Hemsworth is good as Thor yet again, the rest are decent but the star of the characters is Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark. He is such a smart, witty, funny character and he makes the film a lot more interesting. My only fault with acting is that Loki is not 'bad enough'. The actions scenes in the film are really intense and the effects are amazing and realistic (if you include flying robots). Overall the film is fun from start to finish, it's good for all ages and is easy to understand.",9,1,4,3 May 2012
Les Mis√©rables," I don't like musicals
","I don't understand how you can knock this film at all, even if it is a musical. The music is phenomenal, with a surprising excellent performance from Russell Crowe, who in my book played and sang his role the best. You can't help but feel for the characters, especially in the scenes such as; The final battle and Javert's suicide. Hugh Jackman also does a fine job singing, even though he is recognised for portraying Wolverine in the X-Men films. Anne Hathaway's version of 'I dreamed a dream' is outstanding and I don't believe any other actress could pull it off as well as she did. Even if you don't like musicals (like myself), you should definitely see this masterpiece of a film.",10,2,3,3 May 2013
