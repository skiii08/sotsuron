The Avengers," Definitely A Masterpiece by Joss Whedon
","This is one of the most awaited movies of all time - and for the legions of fans in Asia, the wait is going to be over soon. For those who have not yet booked their tickets, I suggest that they do so, preferably at the IMAX cineplex where the action in 3D can be overwhelming.I must say I was a bit skeptical that writer-director Joss Whedon (creator of TV's 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel') can pull off this six-in-one superhero flick. Will it be like assembling six major egos in a small room - and cramming their style? With the plot of 'six against one (Loki)', wouldn't that be overkill and unfair advantage? Will the storyline/plot measure up to the CGI and effects that take up a major part of its US$220 million budget? Will this Disney effort follow in the heels of John Carter and go downhill? All these doubts are dashed after 20 minutes into the movie - when we find Earth being threatened by demi-god Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), the head of S.H.I.E.L.D (for Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division) starts The Avenger Initiative. From here on, it is pure, Marvelous fanboy entertainment of the supreme order! You can bet this one is going to put Whedon among the ranks of top directors like Spielberg and Cameron.Those who have seen Captain America last year may remember the Tesseract, the all-powerful energy cube found at the bottom of the ocean. Loki, the megalomaniacal brother of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) manages to get his hands on it and plans to use it to summon his army of outer space warriors to take over the world.To stop him, Fury and his assistant Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) assemble the various 'superheroes' on his massive 'helicarrier' in preparation for war against Loki's forces. These include Steve Rogers' Captain America (Chris Evans), Tony Stark's Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Dr Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Thor. Special agent Clint Barton, or Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) makes up the sixth member a bit later when Manhattan is being bombarded by outer space monsters.The climactic battle takes up almost all of the final half-hour but the whole movie is absorbing enough, thanks to a cleverly written script that incorporates a fine balance of sincerity and self-effacing wit. Indeed, before the Avengers battle the alien invaders, they fight one another, both physically and verbally. Like, Iron Man's quips when he first meets Thor: 'What's this, Shakespeare in the park?' and 'Does your mother know you're wearing her drapes?' Indeed, the punchlines are more powerful - and memorable - than the real punches.Whedon does not waste time re-introducing his characters. We are already familiar with Iron Man, Captain America and Thor. The physical talents of Scar-Jo's Black Widow are 'introduced' in an interrogation scene where she later beats the brains out of her interrogators while she puts her boss Agent Coulson on hold.I have always wondered how Mark Ruffalo will fare as the Hulk - and I am surprised he almost ran away with the show. His Dr Banner is a mellow guy hiding out in India before being 'persuaded' by Natasha to join The Avengers. On board Fury's helicarrier, we can see him doing his utmost to keep his temper in check - 'you must have been doing a lot of yoga' someone jokes. And yes, when The Hulk emerges, it is really Incredible. Also watch out for Marvel Comics' Stan Lee who gets a self-effacing one-liner during the action scenes.One of the 'misses' of this film is that Natalie Portman's Jane is left out of Thor's story - except for a picture. This is in contrast to Stark's relationship with Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) which takes up quite a few scenes. And even though he has to face-off against six superheroes, Hiddleston's Loki is formidable and menacing enough as the arch villain. Of course, Jackson finally has a proper role here after cameos in the previous Iron Man and Captain America films.It really isn't about whether you're going to catch 'The Avengers'; it's how many times you will want to see it.",8,10,21,24 April 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," The Pace Slackens as the Movie Progresses...
","With a new director (Rob Marshall replacing Gore Verbinski), a new villain (Ian McShane as Blackbeard) and sans two of its lead stars (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley), the POTC franchise is indeed sailing into Stranger Tides. In fact, after the Verbinski trilogy that ended At World's End, this fourth instalment looks like it could use some rejuvenation - hence its plot about a quest for the mythic Fountain of Youth.However, while the pace is supposed to build up to a climax, 'On Stranger Tides' seems to start off fast and frivolous - but gradually slackens in pace and content right to its ending.When the movie opens, we find Capt Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) landlubbing in London - and in search of a ship to skipper. However, he learns that someone is impersonating him and is busy recruiting a crew in a race against the Spaniards to look for the fountain of youth. At one of these recruiting stations, Jack runs into his father (Keith Richards!) and old flame Angelica (Penelope Cruz).After the requisite sword play, drinking, looting and chases, Jack finds himself on board Blackbeard's ship, Queen Anne's Revenge, with Angelica as first mate! Besides the Spanish, a certain one-legged captain (Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa) is also looking for the said fountain - on behalf of the king of England. However, before they can reach the fountain, they must face a bevy of mesmerising men-eating mermaids and procure a tear from one of them, so as to put into effect the power of everlasting youth.Unlike the previous movies, which had heavily-computerised creatures like Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, this one is less of a monster show. However, Depp still wears heavy eye shadow and is back in his usual wacky self as Capt Sparrow, having an audience with King George (Richard Griffiths) and even smooching Judi Dench before setting out to sea. Yes, it is ho-ho-ho and a bottle of fun in Merry Ole England and the pace slackens when the narrative sets sail. Well, at least until we get to the part about the ravenous mermaids, anyway.Cruz takes over from Knightley as female lead but while the senorita can be as feisty as they come, the romantic angle is undeveloped. Instead she keeps the audience guessing as to whether she is the real daughter of Blackbeard. The romance factor comes in a subplot about an earnest missionary (Sam Claflin) and a captured mermaid (Astrid Berges-Frisbey as Syrena). The swashbuckling department isn't that well stocked either.The fights look contrived and the movie lacks tension and suspense. The most 'violent' sequences are those concerning the mermaids - and they don't seem as menacing as they are enigmatic and fetching (with their chests well out of view, of course).Among the cast, Rush is the most entertaining as Barbossa; Cruz earns her keep as the delectable Angelica, but McShane seems to have little to do except look fierce and frightful and occasionally kill someone. On the whole, it's more like the Pirates on Shallow Tides. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",6,8,23,15 May 2011
Men in Black 3," A Bit Outdated But MiB3 Is Still Fun
","Well, whaddaya know, the 'MiB' have gone MiA for 10 years already! No wonder many of us have forgotten about them as Men In Cape and Bodysuits (aka The Avengers, Batman, Spider-Man, et al) have been hogging the cinemas while the 'Men In Black' go missing-in-action. No matter, they are still a barrel of fun in this three-quel that comes as more of a surprise than a treat that we have been waiting for.And with Barry Sonnenfeld back at the helm of this troubled and delayed US$215-million production, it is a nostalgic film in more ways than one.Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones reprise their roles as agents J and K of the secret Men in Black organization that monitors alien activity on Earth. The 'odd-couple' have their work cut out for them when extra-terrestrial serial killer Boris the Animal (Jemaine Clement) escapes from his maximum security prison on the moon and travels back in time to kill K. Since only J remembers K's existence, it's up to him to venture through time, look for a young K (now played by Josh Brolin) and stop Boris from destroying the world once and for all.I have never been a fan of time-travel plots and I still don't like them. However, the time-travel subplot here is just to provide the 'Back To The Future' fantasy to the MiB franchise. The narrative, as well as the mood and tone of the movie, are light-hearted, fun and always on the outer limits of credibility. Again, it is nice to see how a deadpan face like Jones' can generate so much mirth. The Smith & Jones pairing is augmented by Brolin who gives a good representation of how K would be in the Sixties, with most of the sequences accompanied by popular Sixties hits on the soundtrack.One of the staple jokes of the MiB series is the celebrity cameos that suggest alien origins. In MiB3, we have a 'twist' that suggests a certain pop art personality is an undercover MiB agent! Still, the mainstay of the MiB series is Rick Baker's creature designs and make-up rendered in 3D. The 'monster show' does not disappoint, especially that of a huge fish that attacks diners at a Chinese restaurant. Oh yes, there are also a couple of cool gadgets and vehicles like the giant wheel hoover-bikes used by Agents J and K. On the whole, Agents J and K still provide the 'L'. - limchangmoh.blogspot.com",7,90,138,19 May 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Absurd Revisionist Fantasy
","From the title, it is obvious that this is NOT the Abe Lincoln that we  know from the history books. The curiosity factors aroused by this  film, directed by Timur Bekmambetov of 'Wanted' {2008} and 'Daywatch'  {2006} fame, are how creatively the film-makers 'bastardise' American  history, and the set action pieces that Bekmambetov and his crew have  set up.  The answer: They are impressive but a bit ludicrous.  Adapted from the book by Seth Grahame-Smith (who also wrote the  screenplay), the film chronicles the loss of Abe's mother (Robin  MacLeavy) at the hands of a vampire when Abe is still a child. This  serves as the motivating factor for Abe's (Benjamin Walker) subsequent  vampire hunting mission and his burgeoning career as a lawyer and  politician to, finally, his Presidency during the Civil War. Along the  way, he kills countless bloodsuckers led by the vile and vicious Adam  (Rufus Sewell) as part of his secret war against the undead.  The movie is obviously a mix of biopic and horror flick but it fails at  both, and ends up being an expensive action film. This is evident in  the story which has Abe wielding an ax against the marauding vampires  instead of guns with silver bullets. With the ax, we get blood splashes  and dramatic combat action - the sort of targets Bekmambetov usually  aims for. Still, two of his set pieces stand out: a rodeo-styled chase  during a horse stampede, and a climactic fight on a runaway train  speeding across a burning bridge.  I am not really a fan of the main vampire plot which borders on the  ridiculous but Grahame-Smith provides a few interesting and absorbing  subplots, namely the relationship between Abe and his wife Mary Todd  (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). There is chemistry between Walker and  Winstead that makes us care about and believe in this absurd version of  the First Couple. Also, Walker, who looks like a young Liam Neeson (he  has played the younger version of Neeson's title character in Kinsey),  exudes the simple and honest charm one normally associates with Abe  Lincoln. Hence, bravo to the casting department.  One the minus side, the anti-slavery subplot and his rise to the  Presidency are given the short shrift; and the man-vs-vampire clashes  are so absurd that we are constantly reminded that this is revisionist  pulp fiction trying to get on the bandwagon of 'Twilight''s popularity.",6,6,35,20 June 2012
Star Trek," A Brand New Beginning For Trekkies
","Let's face it, the last installment, 'Star Trek Nemesis' (2002), was the last nail in the coffin of the tired sci-fi franchise. Since then, most Trekkies have kissed it goodbye. Now, however, J.J. Abrams has boldly taken the franchise back to where many other franchises have been before - into Reboot territory. With it, we have promises of more outer space capers with the 'new' USS Enterprise and its crew. And if that does not excite the legions of Trekkies all over the world, I don't know what will...This movie is an account of the birth of James Tiberius Kirk (Chris Pine), his wild, rebellious childhood, his recruitment into the Starfleet Academy and his first trip on board the spanking new USS Enterprise under Capt Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Sure, we get to meet the other crew members, namely Spock (Zachary Quinto), troubled half-human, half-Vulcan, and members of his family; the reluctant doctor Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (Karl Urban); the sexy linguist Uhura (Zoe Saldana), the gungho Sulu (John Cho) and a 17-year-old Russian brain named Chekov (Anton Yelchin). Later, Scotty (Simon Pegg) comes aboard as chief engineer - and 'the gang's all here!' The villain is the vengeful Romulan Nero (played with gusto by Eric Bana) - and there are lots of twists and surprises. These include a love interest for the 'emotion-deficit' Spook and an appearance by a famous original member of the Star Trek cast.Director Abrams brings intelligence, inventiveness and definitely, a new beginning to the franchise. He is mindful of its traditions, its history and its nostalgic appeal - and he treats them with reverence. Together with his writers (Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman) he fleshes out Gene Roddenberry's iconic young characters, including the USS Enterprise, and gives them a 'history'. As such, we get to sympathize with them.More importantly, he understands that the franchise is about fantasy and imagination - and he energizes the prequel with state-of-the-art special effects, thrills and stunts (from Industrial Light + Magic). Indeed, Abrams brings new meaning to the famous phrase 'Beam me up, Scotty!' when Chekov does it when his subjects are in motion. Other wonders include a time-travel subplot but it is more confusing than awe-inspiring.However, it is the young and vibrant cast that help to make the movie work. Pine and Quinto (who plays Sylar on TV's 'Heroes') are ideal as leads in this space opera - and the others like Urban, Saldana, Cho and Yelchin not only look like their original players, they also provide humor and a few laughs as well.It's time to boldly go back to the cinema for new Star Trek thrills, folks.",8,12,24,1 May 2009
Iron Man 2," Not as Great as the first, but Still A Good Sequel
","THE first 'Iron Man' was such a well-crafted and fun movie that its sequel would be hard put to keep up the standard. Well, this one, directed by Jon Favreau, tries hard and is nearly there. It has all that one would expect from an 'Iron Man' sequel, even if it is unevenly plotted in some places.What's more, there is Mickey Rourke thundering in as the menacing Ivan 'Whiplash' Vanko and the sexy Scarlett Johansson as the ass-kicking Natalie Rushman (a cover for Black Widow?).The narcissistic and egoistic Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) has owned up to being Iron Man. Under pressure from the US government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armour because he fears the information will get into the wrong hands.Meanwhile, Tony's past is coming back to haunt him. A demented Russian inventor named Ivan Vanko (Rourke) seeks revenge for the wrongs that had been done to his father. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts the powerful new forces that have ganged up on him.The most nail-biting and inventive sequence of the movie comes about 20 minutes into the movie - at the Grand Prix scene where Ivan causes some spectacular mayhem and destruction. After that, every thing seems to pale beside it. The CGI sequences of the armoured men and droids battles bring a sense of deja vu, especially if you recall the actions of the first film. The other 'villain' of the film, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), remains very much a caricature (even if the film is adapted from a comic book) while Garry Shandling seems to be playing Gary Shandling rather than Senator Stern.There are a few pleasant surprises though. They are Samuel L. Jackson as the hard-talking Nick Fury and of course, Johansson who lights up every scene she is in. Paltrow maintains her charm as Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts but she is overshadowed by the nubile and fighting-fit Johansson. At least she helps us forget the 'down' moments of the movie when director Favreau delves into Tony's 'electronic heart' and blood problems.All in all, director Favreau has kept the faith and maintained the thrills and spills of the flying Tin Man. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7,9,25,28 April 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," Spielberg Does It Again!
","When I was a teenager, my favourite comic books were 'Asterix' and 'The Adventures of Tintin' by Herge. You can guess my excitement and anticipation when I learnt that titans Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were collaborating to bring Tintin to life on the big screen. However, when I saw the trailers for 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn', I was a bit apprehensive.Will they capture the spirit of discovery and adventure of the young Belgian reporter? Can they flesh out the many wonderful characters of the comic books? The trailers weren't that impressive. Well, just after 10 minutes into the media screening last Friday, my fears were dashed - and I was transported back to my childhood again! The movie contains elements from three of Tintin's adventures: 'The Secret of the Unicorn' (published in 1945), with some parts of 'The Crab With the Golden Claws' (1943), and a bit from 'Red Rackham's Treasure' (also 1945). It opens with Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) buying a model of an old ship called the Unicorn at an outdoor market in an unnamed European city. As soon as he pays for it, two other guys come along to try and buy the ship too! They are a sinister-looking Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and an American named Barnaby (Joe Starr).Expectedly, Tintin refuses to sell, and he soon discovers that the model ship contains vital clues to hidden treasure involving a Capt. Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis). The ensuing adventure takes Tintin, Haddock and the boy's faithful dog Snowy over the seas to the Sahara and a fictional Moroccan city of Bagghar in search of hidden treasure.For me, the most important part of the movie is its richly detailed retro charm that coloured Herge's comic strips of the early 20th Century (especially the pre-war years). Tintin and Snowy are rendered in the performance-capture shots exactly as they were in the comics and the ageless boy reporter seems to be a tad more mischievous than his comic book persona. Serkis' alcohol-loving Haddock looks so realistic that we mistake him for a live character.Enhanced by 3D, CGI animation affords all sorts of 'impossible' action and stunts and Spielberg exploits this to the full with almost non-stop chases and spectacles. Tintin's chase of a thieving bird through the streets and rooftops of Bagghar is one of the most exhilarating chases I have come across in the cinema. Herge's brand of humour is reflected in the comic relief provided by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as Interpol officers Thomson and Thompson, respectively. The gags are all very PG-type comic relief, and not hilariously funny.Some Herge purists may argue that the movie lacks resonance and an emotional connection to its protagonist. That may be true but personally, I don't remember having much emotional connection to Tintin when I read the comic books. He was a young hero with whom I identified, that's all. Also, watch out for Spielberg's tribute to Herge in the opening scene at the open market. The legendary Belgian author is shown as a street artist who does a sketch of Tintin, looking like one of the original strips. Good for you, Spielberg.

Megamind," Almost Like The Incredibles
","Megamind is what I would call an 'almost-there' movie. It is almost the  epic animation that was 'The Incredibles', almost as hilarious as the  'Madagascar' films and it almost makes you forget you are watching a  3-D movie. When you add up these 'almost points', the score is a family  flick that is both fun and funny to watch, whether in 3-D or not.  Here, the 3-D effects are not obtrusive and after a while, you kind of  get comfortable and forget you are wearing the 3-D glasses. Which, I  must say, is a big plus for the 3-D gimmick. Yes, it is still a gimmick  to make you pay more for the ticket.  Megamind (Will Ferrell) is the super-villain who is trying to conquer  Metro City in every imaginable way possible. However, every time he  tries, he is thwarted by the egoistic superhero Metro Man (Brad Pitt).  Then one day, Megamind succeeds in getting rid of Metro Man! Instead of  being happy, Megamind realizes that achieving his life's ambition is  the worst thing that ever happened to him. He decides that the only way  out of his rut is to create a new hero opponent called Titan, who  promises to be bigger, better and stronger than Metro Man ever was.  Pretty quickly Titan (Jonah Hill) starts to think it's much more fun to  be a villain than a good guy.  Now, if after getting rid of Metro Man, Megamind feels lost without an  arch-rival, he still has his Muse. It is in the form of the feisty TV  newscaster Roxanne Ritchi, played with a huge dose of feminist charm by  Tina Fey. In fact, Roxanne is the heroine and the agent of change for  both Megamind and her cameraman Hal (Jonah Hill again) - although not  necessary for good.  Megamind is about villainy - and if it is lonely at the top, it is also  lonely at the bottom of the moral pool. Writers Alan J. Schoolcraft and  Brent Simons have penned many interesting characters, some of whom  change personality at the turn of a watch bezel. Heroes are boring, and  Metro Man is so full of himself that he is clownish and boring. Not so  Megamind, though. His encounters with Roxanne sparkle with chemistry  and they keep the movie going, both for the kids and adults. And  director Tom McGrath, who also provides the voice for a prison guard,  keeps the pace fast and the tone goofy. It won't blow your mind but it  will tickle your funny bone.",7,2,12,1 November 2010
Tangled," Let's All Let Down Our Hair with 'Tangled'
","With or without 3-D, 'Tangled' looks set to overtake last year's under-achieving 'The Princess and the Frog' at the box-office. What's more, its non-verbal horse named Maximus is bound to give Shrek's talkative Donkey a run for the money! The tale of Rapunzel (voice of Mandy Moore) gets a revisionist twist here and she is 'rescued' not by a handsome prince on a white horse but a young, egoistic bandit (Zachary Levi as Flynn Rider) and a horse (named Maximus) that thinks it is a dog. The villain is Mother Gothel (Donna Murphy), the narcissistic witch who imprisons our princess in a secluded tower.Like 'Beauty & The Beast' and 'The Little Mermaid', 'Rapunzel' also comes with musical and dance numbers. Except for 'Mother Knows Best', most of them have yet to catch on with the public. They may not be as catchy as those of Little Mermaid but given time, some may actually work their magic.What I like best are the solid Disney characterisations, especially of its animals. Mandy Moore's Rapunzel suitably represents Every Girl who is forced to stay home; Flynn plays the Bad Boy-type who sorely needs to be tamed and corrected by the proverbial Love; and the manipulative Mother Gothel aptly reflects the way some kids view their over-protective parent.The show-stealers are the mandatory animal sidekicks - a chameleon named Pascal and the palace horse Maximus. These are not just supporting characters but they have actual 'acting' duties as well. And the fact that they do not speak, helps to boost realism and makes them even funnier. Of course, the action is popcorn stuff but the social themes it explores make for worthy parental contemplation. A fitting film for everyone to let down their hair. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7,3,6,21 November 2010
2012," Almost the Ultimate Disaster Thrill Ride
","WE WERE WARNED: Roland Emmerich's '2012' would be the disaster movie to  end all disaster movies. We sneered a bit, but we believed. Emmerich  has been vying to be Hollywood's Demolition King since his  'Independence Day' (1996), 'Godzilla' (1998) and 'The Day After  Tomorrow' (2004). Now, with the aid of superior CGI, he seems to have  done it.  Basically, '2012' is about the Earth melting at the core! The ancient  Mayans knew about this and researchers say they have even pinpointed  the date to 12-21-12 - or December 21, 2012! Scientifically, though,  mutant neutrinos have boiled the Earth's core like a microwave, causing  quakes, spilling lava and shifting the Earth's crust. That's right.  This means our land mass moves about so violently that we may find  Wisconsin right on the South Pole!   A few people are privy to this info about the imminent end of the  world. One person who stumbles onto the truth is writer Jackson Curtis  (John Cusack) and he goes all out to get his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and  kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) to safety. The authorities  (represented by Danny Glover as the US President, Oliver Platt as the  Chief of Staff and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Adrian Helmsley, the American  scientist who alerts the White House) must use the time they have to  prepare for Doomsday - and a Brave New World!   What can I say about a disaster movie that has all the best bits of all  the other disaster hits like 'Earthquake', 'The Poseidon Adventure',  'Airport' and 'Armegeddon'? The CGI effects look so real and involving  that they keep us on the edge of our seats. Those, plus the Indy  Jones-type escapades of Cusack's Jackson who always manages to be just  inches and split-seconds away from danger and mayhem. Some of these,  like the underwater bid to undo a mechanical problem (a'la Poseidon  films), may be old stuff but they mainly keep us occupied for the  two-and-a-half hour roller-coaster ride!   The subplot about Jackson's family set-up is engaging enough but many  of the plot turns and situations are utterly preposterous. However,  Emmerich makes it clear that he knows how silly they are - by showing  some of them in a tongue-in-cheek manner. It is all a theme park  extravaganza - a thrill ride through one spectacle after another. I can  imagine the fun Emmerich must be having, demolishing national icons  like the White House (for a second time), the Christ statue of Rio and  even St Peter's of Vatican City.  It's no great cerebral fare, but as an End-of-the-World flick, it gets  you there! - by LIM CHANG MOH",7,91,167,10 November 2009
Brave," Highland Fling For Young Girls
","'Brave' is basically a mother-daughter tale set in the Scottish Highlands and spiced with mirth, myth and magic. It is suitably action-packed and centred around a young red-haired heroine that most of today's young girls can relate with. However, its magical elements tend to run away with the story and leave older viewers dissatisfied.The heroine is Merida (Kelly MacDonald), a skilled archer and impetuous daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). Determined to carve her own path in life, Merida defies an age-old suitor custom sacred to the uproarious lords of the land: the massive Lord MacGuffin (Kevin McKidd), surly Lord Macintosh (Craig Ferguson) and cantankerous Lord Dingwall (Robbie Coltrane). Merida's actions inadvertently unleash chaos and fury in the kingdom, and when she turns to an eccentric old Witch (Julie Walters) for help, she is granted an ill-fated wish. The ensuing peril forces Merida to discover the meaning of true bravery in order to undo a beastly curse before it's too late.The first half of 'Brave' is suitably absorbing, fleshing out the characters and personalities, especially of Merida and her mother who are the strongest individuals in conflict against each other. The others in the cast, especially the males, are mostly presented as caricatures, with all of them behaving like buffoons. The free-spirited Merida will not take her pick of them as her suitor - despite Queen Elinor's attempts to bend her daughter's will to the dictates of custom and tradition.The story gets a bit weirder in the second half when it takes on a body-switch twist. From this point on, the battle of wills between mother and daughter is all but put aside as our attention turns to Merida's new crisis. Some reviewers have attributed the movie's lack of plot coherence to the fact that story creator Brenda Chapman left the project midway, leaving Mark Andrews to maintain the directorial reins. I wish to stay neutral on this debate.However, I get the feeling that the plot is missing something when we consider that Merida, in pursuing her right to be 'liberated' rejects all suitors, but leaves her future and that of her 'kingdom' unresolved. Verdict: Not as memorable as 'Finding Nemo' and 'Up', but entertaining for the kids, nonetheless. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7,0,2,20 June 2012
Clash of the Titans," A Mythical Monster Show
","Sitting through this movie, I get the feeling that the main reason for Louis Leterrier and company to do this remake of the 1981 'Clash Of The Titans' is just to flex its special effects muscle for 3D fans. It's a sort of Mythical Monsters Show. There is no attempt to improve the stories of the Olympian gods, or its characters.And yes, they paid tribute to stop-motion wizard Ray Harryhausen by inserting his mechanical owl in a scene when Perseus and his warriors are preparing to set out to do battle with the monsters. The 1981effort was Harryhausen's last movie.The film is basically the story of demi-god Perseus (played by Avatar's Sam Worthington), the bastard son of Zeus (Liam Neeson). It is Perseus' destiny to rescue the city of Argos from the vengeful wrath of Hades (Ralph Fiennes), god of the underworld, and his monster Kraken.Teaming up with a small squad lead by Draco (Mads Mikkelsen), Perseus must giant scorpions, a hideous king turned slayer (Jason Flemyng as Acrisius), the snake-haired Medusa and finally the dreadful Kraken. Also on his side are his guardian angel Io (Gemma Aterthon) and the flying horse Pegasus.As far as remakes go, this one seems content to just lay out the plot which is familiar to those who know the legend. The action on the screen may be in 3D (in selected cinemas) but the characters are mostly two-dimensional.This is especially so of the council of Olympian gods which turned out looking like folks dressed in Halloween costumes mouthing lame lines. Even Neeson looks and sounds fake as the king of the gods.The human warriors fare a little better - with the main theme being Perseus' insistence on being a man rather than the son of Zeus. The Mythical Monster Show, however, has its moments of grandeur and photorealism - and it recalls actions from films like 'Avatar' 'Star Wars' and 'One Million Years BC'. I remember feeling more involved in battle scenes from Harryhausen's 'Jason And The Argonauts' than in this one. This Clash looks like it's going to be a Flash in the Box-Office Pan. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",5,43,103,28 March 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Sparkling chemistry between Damon and Blunt
","Fate, coincidence and free will come at odds with one another in this sci-fi romance re-imagined by George Nolfi from the short story, 'Adjustment Team', by sci-fi legend Philip K. Dick. Nolfi's plot can go from interesting and intriguing to downright silly at times but the main attraction is not the narrative. It is the pulsating chemistry between lead stars Matt Damon and the sensually beguiling Emily Blunt set in all the famous spots of Manhattan and NYC.Having been to New York City recently, I find the sets nostalgic, and I am defenseless to the charms of Emily Blunt.Young Senate candidate for New York City, David Norris (Damon), is rehearsing his speech in the men's restroom when a beautiful stranger (Blunt, right, with Damon) emerges from one of the stalls and starts chatting with him. Before she leaves - in quite a hurry - they have an impulsive, passionate kiss, and he is smitten. Their next encounter in a city bus has to be by chance - and he learns that her name is Elise. He is determined to call her. To court her...And then David comes across a bunch of Men in Black suits and hats, led by a Mr Richardson (John Slattery), who says bluntly: 'We are the people who make sure things go according to plan.' David's relationship with the free-spirited Elise is NOT part of their plan and he must not see her again - for both his and her own good! The rest of the movie is, of course, the tussle between Love and Fate for David. After being charmed by Elise, a rising star ballerina, we can understand why David is bent on seeing her. We can also understand how their relationship would possibly wreck their careers - and why David would want to take a chance on that. David and Elise seem so perfect for each other that we root for them.It is good that Nolfi has written such a romantic angle into this Dick tale instead of turning it into another action flick like 'Total Recall', 'Paycheck' and 'Screamers'. He could have polished up a bit more on the second half to keep it from becoming childish, though. Still, the notion of Fates personified could not be taken too seriously - and it would be better to just go along with the flow of the love story so charmingly portrayed by Damon and Blunt - and supported by a sympathetic Anthony Mackie and menacing Terence Stamp as members of the Adjustment Bureau. Emily Blunt has such captivating eyes that look into your soul and make you weep.",7,82,136,1 March 2011
Super 8," Nostalgic Trip Into the Era of Spielberg's Hits
","'Super 8' takes us back to the glorious days of Spielberg treats like 'The Goonies', 'E.T. The Extraterrestrial', and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. Indeed, written and directed by Jeffrey Jacob Abrams, 'Super 8' is a collaboration between Abrams and Steven Spielberg who serves as producer.As a teenager, Abrams' film-making exploits caught Spielberg's eye and it earned him a gig restoring Spielberg's own 8mm movies. And if, after viewing the movie, you thought that this is Abrams' homage to Spielberg, Abrams has denied it, saying (in an interview) that 'It was never intended as homage to him, but really to that period of my life, which was really the first impulse of this movie.' For many, 'Super 8' will also remind them of their own childhood adventures and maybe even their first love.During the summer of 1979, a group of school friends led by aspiring director Charles (Riley Griffiths) and make-up trainee Joe (Joel Courtney) are making a zombie movie in a small town in Ohio when they witness a catastrophic train crash. The boys, and their volunteer actress Alice (Elle Fanning), soon suspect that there is more to the accident than meets the eye. Soon people and dogs go missing, and violent, inexplicable events begin to take place in town. And as the US military arrive, Joe's dad Jackson (Kyle Chandler), the local Deputy Sheriff, tries to uncover the truth - which turns out to more terrifying than any of them could have imagined.The first thing I noticed about 'Super 8' is how the young cast, led by Dakota Fanning's sister Elle, draw us into their movie-within-a-movie. Fanning's Alice may be talented and pretty and the romantic interest of the boys around her, but she is the gutsiest among the kids. Needless to say, she grabs our attention whenever she is on-screen - as do the other youngsters as they strive to make sense of what is happening from the events captured on the Super 8 camera.The movie may deal with an alien 'invasion' but it is mainly about that time when American adolescents learn about friendship, loyalty, survival and love. Joe, the protagonist, has admired Alice from a distance and boy, does he revel in the chance to touch her face - while doing her make-up. These 'soft' scenes are interspersed with hard-core action sequences like the train crash and the devastation by the alien (which looks quite like the monster from Alien). It is to Abrams' credit that he has resisted the temptation to give audiences a proper view of the 'extra-terrestrial'. Anyway, sustaining curiosity is Abrams' forte, having created TV's 'Lost' and 'Fringe' series.Among the adult cast are Noah Emmerich, who plays the nasty military commander, and Ron Eldard as Alice's father. They put up credible performances but it is a pity to see them upstaged by the outstanding young cast. Bravo to the youngsters. - (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7,4,12,8 June 2011
In Time," 'In Time' Quickly Becomes a 'Waste of Time'
","When film distributors slap an embargo on the reviews of critics, it usually means that the movie in question stinks so much that they don't want bad reviews to mar the movie's opening. This one was embargoed until the day it opened (Oct 26) - and you guessed it, it stinks. The premise, about time as currency, is flimsy at best - and it provokes more questions than answers.The premise: It's the future and it's a world where time is literally being used as money. Aging somehow stops at 25, and the only way to stay alive is to earn, steal, or inherit more time. Will Salas (Justin Timberlake) lives from hand to mouth in a slum-like sector of the city, until a windfall of time gives him access to the world of the wealthy and powerful.There, he meets beautiful young heiress Sylvia Weis (Amanda Seyfried) and they team up to become a futuristic Bonnie & Clyde, despite being relentlessly pursued by a 'Timekeeper' cop (Cillian Murphy).The sci-fi world where people stop aging at 25 - is novel and attractive, until you start thinking about the mechanics of it. One of the most disturbing is the LED timer embedded in the left hand of everyone. Is this timer embedded at birth? If so, it is curious how it stays on when the child grows up. What if the timer is discarded before the age of 25? Will the person die at once? People transfer time by clasping each other's hands and even in arm-wrestling. How does the exchange really work, especially in cases of robbery? These questions mar our acceptance of the movie's premise - and makes the whole idea trashy. And even if we can overlook this set-up, the main plot of Will and Sylvia robbing banks of their time and giving it away sounds so implausible that we feel cheated. Will has spent his whole life fighting for time and he has even lost his mother (played by Olivia Wilde as Rachel) because of just a few seconds. To see him squandering it in that Robin Hood manner is just bad writing and poor motivation.Timberlake and Seyfried are acceptable in their Bonnie & Clyde roles, complete with a titillating underwater scene. Basically, they just need to look macho and sexy respectively, and they succeed in this. Murphy, as expected, shines in his portrayal of a 'time sheriff' where he is part villain and part hero! Thanks to him, there is at least an emotional side to the whole movie. Otherwise, it is a sheer waste of time. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",Null,7,15,28 October 2011
Dark Shadows," Not his Best, but Burton is Still Entertaining
","Back in 1966, decades before 'True Blood', 'Buffy' and 'Angel', America had a supernatural TV series called 'Dark Shadows'. This series, which ran up to 1971, was centred on Barnabas Collins, a 200-year-old vampire played by Jonathan Frid (who died after this movie was filmed). Curiously, this campy series had such an influence on director Tim Burton and Johnny Depp that they decided to make a modern version of it.The result is this lavish production that has Depp playing Barnabas Collins as a 200-year-old vampire who wakes up in 1972 and is forced to navigate an era of hippies, pot, disco and free love. With its clock set in the Seventies, I suspect the movie will resonate better with the older viewers than the youngsters.A voice-over prologue relates how the Collins family moved from decadent Liverpool to Maine, in the New World, circa 1795. The family set up a fishing industry in a town named after themselves: Collinwood. Just when the future seemed bright for Barnabas (Depp), a love triangle involving a witch (Eva Green as Angelique), and Barnabas' girlfriend Josette (Bella Heathcote) turned tragic - sending Josette to her watery grave and turning Barnabas into a vampire. Angelique then set the townsfolk on Barnabas who was captured and buried alive.Fast-forward to 1972 and we find young Victoria Winters (Heathcote, again) arriving at Collinwood Mansion to take up a position as governess to David Collins (Gully McGrath), nephew of matriarch Elizabeth (Michelle Pfeiffer). Also staying at the mansion are Elizabeth's brother, Roger (Jonny Lee Miller); her impudent teen daughter, Carolyn (Chloe Grace Moretz) and child psychiatrist Julia Hoffman (Helena Bonham Carter). Meanwhile, construction workers unearth Barnabas' coffin and resurrects him...'Dark Shadows' is certainly not among the best of Burton's films and neither is it among Depp's greatest efforts. However, the weird and offbeat Burtonesque ambiance and tone are evident and coupled with notable performances by the cast, it is an entertaining effort. The gags that sent our preview audience into laughter and guffaws involve Barnabas' view of the 'modern' world of the Seventies. The vampire is intrigued by lava lamps and the songs of Karen Carpenter, whom he thinks also deals in woodwork. And yes, he also thinks Alice Cooper is the ugliest woman he has ever seen.Burton puts the Seventies hit songs to good use, evoking nostalgia and a sense of campiness among the audience. One of the pleasures of watching a Burton movie is seeing Depp in his deadpan, tongue-in-cheek role, setting a jocular mood to the proceedings. His violent love tryst with Eva Green's sexy Angelique is a highlight of the movie.Another delight is Chloe Moretz who delivers some of the juiciest lines. Among the flaws are Barnabas' inconsistent reactions to sunlight and other vampire clichés which I prefer to overlook. Overall, a nice change from the 'Twilight' offerings.

Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Stunning Effects But the movie lacks Heart and Soul
","It's 'Bayhem' time again - and this time around demolition king Michael Bay presents his trademark 'Six-C's' in glorious 3D! In case you don't know, the six 'Cs' are: chases, clashes, crashes, combustions, carnage and cleavage. Spread over a bottom-numbing two-and-a-half hours, 'Transformers: Dark Of The Moon' can also induce mental and metal fatigue, especially with the clanging robots smashing one another - and the whole exercise making little sense.Technologically, however, 'Dark Of The Moon' is Bay's best work so far - and action fans looking to be awed by scenes of massive mayhem and destruction in 3D should be satisfied. Story-wise, this one is better than 'Revenge Of The Fallen', but not as fun and emotionally-connecting as the first.The film opens with a flashback to the Sixties Apollo landing mission where history is rewritten (by Ehren Kruger) to incorporate the cover-up of an alien spaceship crashing on the moon. That spaceship, of course, is one of the remains of the epic battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and its 'discovery' sparks off another war that threatens to destroy planet Earth. Or at least the face of Chicago as we know it.On the human level, we find that Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has traded in his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) for a newer model (a Victoria Secret one, to be exact) in the shape of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Carly). Sam is being offered a job by Bruce Brazos (John Malkovich) but we soon learn that Carly's boss Dylan (Patrick Dempsey) may be up to no good. Then, when the conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons hots up, Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) of the elite Government squad NEST are summarily called into action.We get lulled into believing that there may somehow be an intelligent plot coming from the conspiracy of the NASA lunar-landing cover-up which also involves the Russian space program and Chernobyl. These turn out to be just an exercise in 'historical name-dropping' to spur our interest before we get to the demolition derby created by the Transformers. Indeed, some of the robots seem to emote better that the live cast. Cybertron leader Sentinel Prime, for example, is even designed to look like Leonard Nimoy (who provides its voice), complete with stuff that looks like beard. Again, the problems of the previous installments recur - like the confusion between the good and bad robots in the clashes.Unlike the first two movies, there are no more gags about the shock of humans interacting with the mechanical 'bots. Bay, however, insists on some comic sequences and he has hired Ken Jeong to do his in-your-face shtick as Jerry Wang. John Turturro reprises his role as former FBI agent Simmons but this time around, Turturro finds it fit to clown around with his role. The most striking inclusion to the cast is Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam's love interest. However, with limited acting talent, she provides only eye-candy and beside her, Megan Fox would look like an Oscar-caliber actress.Like the first 'Transformers', this one is also a live-action cartoon on a grand scale. Scenes of Chicago buildings being toppled and destroyed can be as spectacular and brain-numbing as those of September 11; and the wing-suit flying sequences are breath-taking. Indeed, these are what most of Michael Bay's fans pay for and they will not be disappointed. The only problem for me is that Bay prolongs and repeats the robotic clash sequences to the point of being self-indulgent. Technically brilliant and visually arresting, 'Dark Of The Moon' lacks heart and soul. (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",6,271,458,28 June 2011
