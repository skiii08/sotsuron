Skyfall," Skyfall falls
","Expectations were high but the final product haven't met those expectations the reason being,why to bring in the character severine just to take bond to silva and while silva had chance to kill M at the court, he fires the first shot at someone else that shows Mr.Mendes intention to drag the movie till the end and finally kill M at skyfall...Total boredom.Particularly in India were fan following for bond movies are high compare to other Hollywood movies, the screenplay wasn't having depth to hold on audiences to their seats and it was hi-low kind of roller coaster ride through out.",7,1,7,4 November 2012
