Lucky Number Slevin," Implausible nonsense
","What do you get when you cross Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and a low budget Tarantino effort? This. As for the Hasidic Jews, they look about as Jewish as Bugs Bunny.",2,0,1,1 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Low art and cheap thrills
","Considering the budget and talent available, a disapointment.",1,3,4,3 April 2020
Midsommar," The real horror is the grain of authenticity
","Whilst the imagery is disturbing the real horror is the concept, because the plot actually contains grains of authenticity. Idolatry from Molach down to Nazism involved unspeakable cruelty and human sacrifice. Modern cults likewise exploit ignorant and vulnerable people searching for spirituality through drugs and indoctrination.",8,1,5,12 April 2020
Joker," Rare masterpiece
",Powerful and relevant but not always easy to watch.,10,3,5,4 April 2020
Gangs of New York," Impressive budget and cast but too long
","After the first hour I grew, well frankly bored. Daniel Day Lewis, some admittedly good scenes and a fabulous historical New York set are insufficient to rescue an overly protracted drama that is too long and self indulgent.",3,1,5,7 June 2020
