Spartacus," They were better off as slaves!
","Ok, good movie with lots of great acting (Ustinov especially), but the ending was very unsatisfactory. SPOILER COMING UP: Out of the thousands of people who fought for Spartacus, in the end only his wife and baby son get away and it's not like their future is that safe from the Romans either. He only achieved something on an individual level. They say at the beginning it would take a further 2000 years for slavery to be abolished so it all seemed like a big waste of time. Well, at least it was a fun and enjoyable waste of time, i guess, but it wasn't as good as ol' Ben-Hur.",8,0,1,7 September 2002
Minority Report," Very, very disappointed in Spielberg.
","This time, Spielberg has tried to be too clever for his own good. For a storyline that brings up so many fascinating philosophical issues (such as predetermination and free will), the chance to make a classic is wasted. Stevo wants us to take him seriously, but when a chased man in a tightly secured future world can escape about fifty heavily-armed cops coming right at him from all directions, be able to then get back into the PD as a fugitive by just bringing along his eye with him and then having his wife do it again is ridiculous to say the least. Some people may be ok with this, but I need a little more from my films (unless Arnie's in it cos you're just prepared for the ridiculously unbelievable then). The ending was a HUGE let-down, nothing to save the film there. Also, why did all the actors feel it necessary to mumble through their lines? The story is confusing enough as it is, let alone having to keep rewinding the tape to try and decipher what they were all saying. I can't even commend the storyline for being original, practically the same one was used in an episode of 'Sliders' that was made years before this film started production. All in all, a poor effort. 3/10.",3,1,2,28 December 2002
Caddyshack," It's The Rodney Dangerfield Show!
","Zany events take place in and around an exclusive golf course. I like this film for 3 things only- Rodney, Rodney and Rodney. He takes every opportunity he gets to crack a one-liner: 'He called me a baboon, thinks I'm his wife'. You're just waiting for Dangerfield to come on again just so the film can pick up.I was very disappointed with Bill Murray, while I understand hardcore 'shack fans loved him in this role, I didn't. He's a DEADPAN comedian, his scenes especially were just silly and dumb. Which might have been alright if they were funny. I loved Bill Murray in Ghostbusters, but to see him stoop this low, trying to make a joke out of hunting a gopher, was embarrassing.My advice would be to just fast forward to the scenes that have Dangerfield or the Judge (the late Ted Knight) in them. There the only two guys in this film who get my respect!",7,0,2,21 August 2002
A Beautiful Mind," You can only say this film is average at best. (mild spoiler).
","I've never really liked films which glorify people while they're still alive and despite all the problems we see Nash go through, there is just something wrong with it, it all seems very vain. Like when Margaret Thatcher and Bobby Robson unveiled their statues here in England recently, tributes like that should be reserved for the dead.Besides, the film wasn't very good anyway, I didn't really think Crowe was Oscar material as Nash mumbling with that silly accent through it all. Connelly (I can't believe that was the girl from 'Labyrinth'!)dutifully just did what she had to and the relationship between the two was wooden at best. Ron Howard never really made us understand how any woman could be attracted to this man, probably because we never got to appreciate Nash's genius as we saw him most of the time as a right weirdo.Having said all that, I liked the idea that the 'doctors' this time were actually trying to help him and not conventionally the bad guys. I only wish I was able to leave the cinema understanding more of why Nash won the Nobel prize and the contributions he gave us. Still, the film has just enough intrigue to keep the ball rolling. 5/10.",5,0,1,29 December 2002
