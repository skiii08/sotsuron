The Rock," The actioneer that out-dumbed them all
","It was nice to have Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harry in the same movie. Other than that The Rock is a dumb piece of hastily packed-together action scenes. Every situation is dull, no single action scene is anything original or engaging, it's all dumb-out action, loud score, cheap sentimentalism/patriotism with an overbearing sense of professionalism.Nothing new in it, the epitome of fast food food cinema. This piece of trivia sums it up perfectly: 'Average Shot Length = ~2.6 seconds. Median Shot Length = ~2.5 seconds. (About 2900 shots)' No wonder it's not the work of a storyteller, rather one of a butcher-pyrotechnist.",2,1,6,1 November 2008
Lucky Number Slevin," Wants to be a clever cool movie. Fine images, poor despicable story.
","I was curious about this movie that went right below the radar and ends up with a big score on IMDb years after release. Usually when a movie nears 8.0 stars on IMDb you can expect a sure amount of quality. Now if quality is the good start it is not sufficient to make a good movie.Lucky Number Slevin has many qualities: high production values that translate into fine photography and direction, with a great cast. The editing is precise and smooth to blend all this too. Now you start a production with a script and I very much doubt that the script for Lucky Number Slevin was ever that great. I have a name for that narrative category: Pretty Clever Whodunnit. It is a tired plot device to draw an apparently convoluted story where you only tell what it was all about at the very end.I know that most people are suckers for this kind of a story, especially when it is very well packaged such as in this movie. Personally I find this to be more deceptive than really clever. I enjoyed Usual Suspects on first viewing but I cannot stand a second viewing. I enjoyed Sixth Sense too but I would never watch it again. Obviously not everybody is able to come close to Psycho in the sense that the point of the movie shouldn't be concentrated in a final bang.Aside from that, Lucky Number Slevin has a tonal problem. It has a cartoonish approach to characters (especially with Morgan Freeman as The Boss and Ben Kingsley as The Rabbi) that is really at odds with the core story of a mistaken identity case that implies lots of - cold blood and gratuitous - murders. Does it aim to be a light realistic Tarantino endeavour or a dark thriller? It does not choose, it wants to be a funny and cool story where people happen to go murder somebody else just like that. And this puts the movie very low on my scale.",4,3,7,4 April 2014
Captain Phillips," A truly boring story
","What's the point? Shooting a personal monument to Captain Phillips? The story is really not worth a movie. Actually Somali pirates are not a very interesting antagonist group in terms of action, but the movie does depict that well. A bit too well when comes the final part and the U.S. of A. unleashes hell to handle the situation.Maybe one can appreciate that it is not a dumb Hollywood actioneer with cliché bad guys kicking everything around until the empire strikes back. But what difference does it make in the end when the Navy firepower comes into play? True story may be gripping. I'd say they are when it is more about character than about action. Here in Captain Phillips - as in United 93 - it is about action and true to life action is somewhat weak. Honesty never was a prerequisite for a good movie, but I guess Paul Greengrass's talent has been wasted on the false perception that his ability to shoot action sequences was rooted in an efficient 'honest-documentary-style' approach. On the other hand I guess Greengrass himself is attracted to real-life characters which unfortunately lead to weaker all-around action than with a movie-calibrated hero.I hope Greengrass finds a hero with substance who also happens to be caught in a vortex of action. In a nutshell: some Jason Bourne with a memory and a conscience.",4,2,4,11 March 2015
Source Code," A bit patchy, feels like a nice B-movie
","First things first I eventually watched Source Code after avoiding it on release for its nerdish title. Source Code is a vague concept and I would never think of it as an attractive or even intriguing title. But yes, to me source code is about computer science so it has a very mundane meaning, and this makes me think of Matrix, which is also about some Reality Source Code, but with a cleverer - indirect, evocative - title.In retrospect I was expecting more action but I was OK with the approach, only it didn't bloom into something really powerful IMHO. The main problem is in the plot device, which is actually the Source Code device. The great ambition of the script is to win on two counts: the mission (into a parallel reality) and reality. The former is more about action, but mixes with wider life concerns, sentiments, while the latter is fuzzier with a difficult blend of mystery, life, duty and trust.Going back and forth between reality and the parallel reality of the Source Code proves to be a poor narrative choice since it is done much too often and suspense cannot reach high levels once you are just expecting developments on both counts. The inter-cutting with present was greatly criticized in Titanic, but it really added suspense by giving us a better understanding of the technical side, which was only in the background of the lovers story.On the other hand the cinematography is great. Well there are actually only half a dozen of the train in the countryside, then approaching Chicago, and also of Chicago itself. Most notably are very nice helicopter shots in the opening credits, even if this bears little relevance to the story itself (since Chicago is just the background). But the rest feels cheap, like B-movie cheap. It would be OK if there was a tense suspense, but the constant inter-cutting results in a hurtful discrepancy between great establishing shots on one side (and their redundancies BTW) and the closed narrative spaces (the train and the labs). The patchy look just makes weaker parts more salient and obvious.I am surprised Source Code got such a fine IMDb rating. I guess it plays to the crowd of Matrix enthusiasts. I admit Source Code aims for originality, while Eagle Eye, for example, is more of a routine actioneer with SF undertones. I personally found Eagle Eye more satisfying in the end. Maybe it aimed lower, but it was not getting pretentious with sentimentalist stuff. Both movies don't succeed in being totally impressive, but one doesn't mess with its inner narrative flow. Having a pieced up narrative is really not piece of cake, and if you fail to make it look great it just looks obvious and pretentious too. In Source Code it is obvious the storyline is stretched to reach the 80-minute mark, and the growing sentimentality is only obvious too, there is nothing really deep in it.Casting: I was not impressed by Jake Gyllenhaal, he does the job but I wouldn't say the main character is a great part. Michelle Monahan was better here than in Eagle Eye, perhaps because it is more of a quiet girl-next-door part. Vera Farmiga was just wasted in a translucent role. Eventually I find Jeffrey Wright is a very weak actor, I couldn't get how they cast him as Felix Leiter, he is always hamming it to exist in the frame. He certainly contributes a great deal to the cheap B-movie feel here.",5,1,6,20 November 2013
Skyfall," An all-around winner... except for the script
","It is a pleasure to eventually watch a Bond movie that is not just a quick and dirty actioneer. Especially since the franchise, in its Daniel Craig days, had clearly accepted the Greengrass/Bourne way to shoot action as a basic requirement. All-out action is still here but the other scenes are not just rushed intermezzi. Efficiency is not the only thing that matters here as opposed to the 22 previous instalments.The villain is good. The character is perfectly tailored and brilliantly flesh out by Javier Bardem, but then the script forgets to build an engaging story around him. OK we didn't need a 23rd variation on a plot to rule the World, and it was an interesting idea to have the villain hunt down 007 instead of the usual formula with Bond sneaking inside the villain's base. But this should have been a -suspenseful- beginning, this cannot be a climactic ending.Anyway Craig's Bond really shifts the paradigm. He is a somber agent only enjoying high life and hot gals in between brooding phases. Before Craig 007 was a comics hero, then they wanted to make him more human (the original Casino Royale story more or less implied this), for fear of wearing out the audience expectations after so many sequels, copycats and - worst of all - spoofs. Having grown up with the lighter-hearted Connery and Moore versions it is difficult to feel the same buoyant enthusiasm. Allegedly Licence to kill was a flop because James Bond had suddenly become a violent machine with hardly a sense of humour. Then Brosnan was the silliest of all. Skyfall goes so far as reaching for the hero's youth backstory. Let's say there's a backstory but we don't want to watch 007 with a shrink. Digging up backstories is really a lazy screenwriter's hack job.Fortunately images and action are both great in the last part, but then you feel you was given the wrong medicine. This could have been the setting for a Living dead or Vampire movie shootout, but this bucolic/pyrotechnic ending really doesn't feel like a Bond movie Third Act.So, I can appreciated the different Bond as played by Daniel Craig and I certainly appreciated to watch 007 move around in a more polished product, but I still need some real creative story to be told around these. Is the franchise turning into a series? Including some surprise at the end of the season? Some can't wait to watch Bond 24, not me. My expectations were quite low for Skyfall and I was able to enjoy it despite its flaw, but now I am suspicious, I am expecting them to reproduce only the less good parts.",7,5,13,29 October 2012
The Ring," Why The Ring << Ringu
","To put it simply where Ringu was elliptic, The Ring is a heavy-handed horror flick. Ringu mastered a blend of horrific fantasies with simple reality. The shuffling pace of its horror perfectly fitted the narrative structure: 'We want to know, to know only. But we have to experiment...'Yes, this is kind of the same premise as most slasher movies like, say, Scream 3. The difference is Ringu concentrated on it, leaving behind every over-used scheme, building its story and its rhythm over the journalist's investigation. The Ring drifts from this, focusing not on the journalist's investigation but on the journalist herself, her lovely sixth-sense lucid little boy and, last but not least, her dull-blank ex-boyfriend. But developing the central character is definitely not the point: it's all about the horror itself, stupid!'It's a remake, dude! Let's make it thoroughly understandable and bigger than life.'Producing an American version means lots of out-of-the-box rough-tunings. So first they build the story around Naomi Watts, director Verbinski revels in nice close-ups of his star all along her 'seven day pitch'. Then they used every narrative and horror cheap trick available. Of course they jumped on the opportunity to build up that little boy that sees. In the way they designed a sad witness for the source of horror (oh, the poor cursed father!). The horror cheap tricks are mainly expensive special effects: sophisticated ugly make-up and some digital stuff, all ringing out of tune.Eventually where is the horrific suggestive strength of Ringu? Why alleviate the original ending after dragging these leaden ballasts all along? When a movie/book is good enough there's no room for an adaptation. But I must be wrong since The Ring gathered more than $100m.",6,3,7,6 February 2003
United 93," Honest work
","United 93 is OK. I was not interested in watching a movie that told the story of the 'fourth hijacked plane of 9/11' since this is not what I expect from a movie. Actually, for 'very serious events' such as acts of war involving many civilian death, I'd rather watch a good documentary that doesn't have to chose between angles and can expand those that are spiralling away from action itself.The real story of United 93 is pretty simple, alas. Paul Greengrass does a great job of putting in the perspective of that fateful day. Now the real story is pretty lame in terms of action and it is distressing to sit through what happened on this flight. People were brave, but mostly because the terrorists were unlucky departure was delayed thus the shock factor vanished gradually as people got time to phone and understand the big picture.I don't feel this adds much to the story, on the other hand there was no telling a different story. And I don't think movies should just be made to entertain the masses. Maybe the victims family appreciated the homage, but as a movie it has the same value as a wikipedia entry. I would even say it is less gripping because all is shown and you have little legroom to imagine how it looks like, hence less power to imagine yourself in that plane.",5,0,1,19 January 2015
Minority Report," Here we are now, entertain us.
","Ok Mr Spielberg you are the king of movie entertainment. You know what it takes to please American audiences. You obviously have big fun making movies and what is more you make the big buck. Hitchcock was once overlooked as a mere entertainer but there's nothing ridiculous in every single movie he shot between, say, 1935 and 1963. And he shot one a year. Perhaps childhood was too sweet for you and you don't want to become a big boy. You like better when everything seems beautiful and nice in the end. Too bad you're the kind of spoilt child with a gift for directing and pleased with your stuff.Minority Report is the typical Spielberg movie. A patchwork of high flying directoring skills with an abysmal ending. The result is a movie you will forget as fast and smoothly as any action flick by some dull director.The premise was excellent. It has been laundered.The end could have been gripping with John Anderton being arrested and realizing the truth and starting an eternal nightmare.With the lights out it's less dangerous.",5,1,2,22 October 2002
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," The perfect blend of funny and serious
","The major achievement of Crazy, Stupid, Love is to bundle so much fun and emotion, without a dull moment, in a basically routine suburban family crisis setup. You can't say this for a whole lot of movies each year, unfortunately.It doesn't start fast, it's rather low key until you get your run through the whole exposition. But it gathers momentum, scene after scene situations become crazier while never spinning out of hand, and characters are consistent and likable all along.With such a nice movie, delivering on all counts, you should be plenty happy. Yet, if you really insist, typecast is Julianne Moore as the neurotic suburban wife (but she does it very good and with some nuance from previous assignments) and typecast is Marisa Tomei as the crazy funny spicy litmus gal. These great actresses are really underused here. For it's more a movie about the guys, understanding them and have some fun with them, but who cares about this bias as long as it works?",8,0,1,6 October 2011
Us," Get Out was promising but mostly predictable. Us is just a big mashup
","I guess Jordan Peele will now be content with mining his ore: rehash of major horror movies with a little conspiracy sprinkled over so that people confuse protracted story with brilliance (Christopher Nolan has mastered this Agatha Christie recipe).
M. Night Shyamalan still makes movies that find it hard to extract themselves from the original swamp. Dario Argento failed to leave Giallo behind so he does Giallo and you are sometimes redeemed by a couple of brilliant scenes.What is brilliant with Us? It's a total rehash, mainly based on Funny Games which I think is the most horrific movie I have watched (1997). Except Us is a stupid reinventing of Funny Games: it is boringly predictable, horror switches to tongue in cheek humor and disjointed storyline.By the time you reach the end you are happy that the 3 'alternate' female characters do add some tension, but it's too little and you don't care about the heavy resolution. At least Minnie Ripperton adds some beautiful brilliance at the very end.",3,0,2,5 May 2020
The Secret in Their Eyes," Recipe to please Hollywood
","A good melodrama with nice characters who, for some reason, cannot communicate directly. Add a touch of suspense, with a plot taking its time to unfold, and more -contained- pathos. Let it cook for over 2 hours, then you have it.I am not being unjust here. Yes, 'El Secreto de sus Ojos' is a perfectly crafted movie, with fine performances. Now is it an excellent movie that does resonate and will continue to resonate with audiences a couple of years from now? Certainly not.So what? I am quite sure we can find a better 2009 'foreign language' movie. So this one has one special thing, a special thing which resonates with the very audience voting for the Award it got. And that's the problem with critics, they love movies on the basis of the limited set of values of their little worlds. So the wider world should never take them into account.A more personal note: I found it difficult to watch Ricardo Darin act as an almost introverted character. He is really good, but something in the movie doesn't fit. He is buoyant, he is easy-going, yet he behaves as a wimp (most critics must be wimps). Mixing present (old character with hindsight) with flashbacks (wimp) doesn't help to see eye to eye with the main character. And as far as I understand, to some this weakness must be a tremendously valuable asset for the whole movie.",5,8,23,2 December 2010
The Others," Too much work and not enough screenplay makes the Others a dull film
","Is it sufficient to be a master director to make a very good film? The Others and the other movie-with-a-much-similar-story proves not. It's nice and halfway through the story we begin to wake up, and so? Nothing because the whole script derives from one idea which is to tell a peculiar story and explain only in the end why it is so peculiar. Thus nothing really happens except cheap thrills here and there to draw some kind of a tension. Some evoked Hitchcock: he played on his audience's nerves which is a lot harder than just stating our nerves are tensile. I have had enough of those movies that think they're clever because there is something to be said but ye shalt wait for it.",5,0,0,2 January 2002
About Time," Amusing... for about 30-45min, and then B-O-R-I-N-G
","This is the story of nice little - if unoriginal - idea. One that could be the basis of a nice little short movie. Or even a brilliant masterpiece of a short movie. But 2 hours :gasp: :yuk: please! About Time is lovely written, of course, every scene is charming, subtle and funny and just spot on, and the cast is just wonderful. But the whole story is a chore. Once Tim gets the love of his life, what do we care? Everything else looks tediously uninteresting, there is nothing left to fight for and the philosophical lesson, the Great Secret of Happiness is very long in the telling so you just want to get it over with.In French we say that 'Happy people are not worth a story' and that's exactly the point here: you just wish you won't have watch years and years in the life of a happy man who can go back in time and tweak every little detail he got wrong the first time, and with not real major downside. I guess this pretty soon gets boring to him as it got boring for Bill Murray in the Groundhog Day before he understand that love would be the meaning of life.In About Time our 'hero' Tim is just a nice little boy, very clean, adorable and sweet upbringing (sure it is not a Ken Loach movie but soft and gentle Soap Opera, must we?): one plain boring nerd with a plain boring perfect cute love story he patches together. Groundhog Day was about a curse, not a fancy gift, and Bill Murray was an edgy and fascinating character indeed. Same starting point: great movie here, insufferable drivel there.",3,10,30,24 November 2013
Insomnia," Nothing special, story is pretty flat and the atmosphere is not really great
","Nothing thrilling, it is more like a procedural with some twists. The procedural wasn't tense and the twists therefore just happened along the way.To me there is a nonchalant way of telling this story, embodied by the ever nonchalant Pacino. The Internal Affairs back-story may have looked brilliant at the time, but it totally dilutes the case and actual setting. Choosing permanent daylight season may have looked brilliant too but it loses the edginess of a tired cop too used to open his eyes in the dark.In the end nothing really caught my eye - I would even say I found the overall editing of the story choppy - and most of all the Insomnia gimmick didn't work and fast became annoying.",4,3,6,3 October 2014
500 Days of Summer," Cutie indie, just boring enough not to rise above its ambition
","Ah Indies done by brainerds who rever the verbose French New Wave, the intellectual misfits at a loss to communicate with others, especially the other sex. Too bad we are only offered this type of character, acting as a decoy for the screenwriter's psychoanalysis, and thus get a boring train of self-lamentation, more moaning and perennial inability to pull oneself by one's bootstraps.Bring in a good cast, fine production values (as opposed to erratic camera work and post-modernist settings), spread it all over by cutting back and forth in the timeline and bam, you get a cutesy indie. As usual this might have be an excellent short... provided the main character was beefed up with some self deprecating humor for instance.",5,0,1,3 May 2020
The Prestige," Christopher Nolan, trick director
","I didn't remember who was the director of The Prestige when I finally decided to watch it. So this is not a matter of prejudice, but when the credits eventually rolled I was relieved both because I found it overlong and protracted and because I was now definitely able to put a word on why I don't like Christopher Nolan as a director.Let me start at the beginning. I just start to watch The Prestige as an honest viewer. I am not that found of magic shows but this sounded like a nice story. Actually I remember it's IMDb ranking and the presence of Michael Caine who put the movie on my backlog of recent flicks I might enjoy. Early on the storyline fluctuates between various times: past, past-perfect, present. It's OK, but it really doesn't help the movie build up 'emotional momentum'. The story never trusts continuity so we are demanded to always switch our attention on episodes that explain the whole story one anecdote at a time.PLOT OBSESSION Most viewers seem to like this very authoritative way of telling the story. They are told what to watch, what to understand little by little and it's all about the plot, the plot, the plot. Characters are mere props. In the Prestige I realised Hugh Jackman is only an average actor. I agree the part is not the greatest but he really doesn't shine. As for Christian Bale I already knew he was a big ham who thinks he's good, dead serious while trying too hard to display his actor's studio abilities. Both actors are boring at best in the course of this story, and Christian Bale as the most boring part of all.Well it's a fact that the lead illusionists are mean and inhuman characters. The chopped up narration only makes it more about their sick minds than their wounded souls. Fortunately there are a few nice characters here. Michael Caine adds humanity and presence to a simple part, and the feminine characters also help the movie rises up from its plot obsession. The production values help too, when the nicest characters aren't there.Christopher Nolan is only too happy to have his plot tick like a clockwork, but eventually he is only a trick director in the same way as Agatha Christie was a trick writer. Characters don't matter, they're here to do the trick. Memento was a one-trick movie. Batman begins and The Prestige are very similar with their trick-filled characters immobile while the whole movie revolves around them in a big spinning trick. And Inception is a trick in a trick in a trick. Characters start as tricksters and they soon vanish behind the tricks layer.To me that is the opposite of cinema: the trick is the show while it should be the illusion that it creates. Weird since this is the main lesson, clearly enunciated, in The Prestige: 'There is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art.' (R. L. Stevenson)",5,2,5,23 October 2012
Crash," Multi-pronged story with a bit of gusto but little achievement
","Mixing several story lines has become a fixture for independent film-making after Pulp Fiction made it cool. Then independent came to mean nothing more than a genre more prone to grab Oscar noms than the immediate buck at the Box-office.Most of the time these movies have one very good story and the rest is a bit weak. Soderbergh's Traffic perfectly exemplified this in 2000, and now Crash has come to grab the supreme Academy Award with very little originality and substance indeed. It's not a bad movie but it lacks the feel of a movie that gets into you, only pulling the easy strings, pinching the usual emotional wire in a very professional way. So where is there emotion in Crash? It is hidden here and there with the fine actors yet on the whole it's too scarce to give you the impression it's great. It's nicely put together but it never takes you away.One scene speaks millions: the one with the little girl running to her father outside the house with the Persian shop owner nearby. Well done. It does work, but inside the whole movie it eventually proves to be only a nicely polished piece with little relevance.Compare this to Amores Perros. The middle story is weaker but everything is more consistent, everything flows from the camera, it's not only about taking us for an emotional trip around LA, it's truly about characters getting us into a story, their story. Hence the emotion.",5,2,5,12 January 2009
Shutter Island," Overused storyline, overblown execution
","This is the third time, and thus the last time, I decide to go watch a Scorsese/DiCaprio movie. A utter disappointment. Di Caprio teamed with Scorsese so he could have a great director to secure a couple of solid films over the years. I don't know who's at fault here, but Gangs of NY, The Aviator, and now Shutter Island are all devoid of emotion. They are symptomatic of this Hollywood cancer were everything looks utterly professional, well designed and nicely crafted, lots of work, energy and dough that can't make up for the lack of creativity. Lots of TV series are much better at that, and no wonder since the best writers are continuously fleeing towards non-cinema formats.The good points are the location, which would really deserve a better story, Dante Ferreti's settings and the cast - although I'm bored with good boy DiCaprio doing his best with the contrived emotional range stuffed for the main character in those scripts. Scorsese is just a journeyman in those flicks. The story is so heavy handed, it's a pity to see his devoted editor patch together dead-long scenes overflowing with pathos and deliver such this overlong and overblown continuity. There's nothing in Scorsese's direction that makes you feel the ever-present insanity. It's all in the annoying score and cheap horror tricks.Nuff said. Scorsese can't do great movies if they're not about Italian American marginals and mobsters. With Di Caprio he is bound to do overblown impersonal stuff. And Di Caprio should start to look for a real villain part because we've seen him to much trying to do good with his chubby face.Bottom line: if I had downloaded this movie instead of going for the big screen, I would most certainly have stopped watching and erase it 45min into the story, would have saved me lots of time and the bore of a movie becoming worse and worse as it rolls out on the sickening pretense of being clever.",3,7,15,23 March 2010
Interstellar," 2001 for Dummies
","If Spielberg had wanted to remake 2001 that is the kind of stuff we could have expected. Kubrick was derided as being to coldly cerebral (by the hilarious Pauline Kael) so his opus with Arthur C. Clarke was a powerful - philosophical - ellipse about mankind. Interstellar is a dumbed down version where humans do get to express their feelings and AI have a humour parameter.I liked the futuristic vision of Earth, it was great to see something different, in between post-doomsday and pure phantasmagoria. Now the way to connect a brilliant pilot (simply the best) stuck in the dust to the plan to go interstellar was just a gigantic leap of faith for anyone invoking suspension of disbelief. Not that it stroke me violently as such during the show but you are waiting for the Man to fly to the stars and when you see how they managed to transition to this part you do feel this is cheap.Then Interstellar moves forth with lots of boring exposition about why, when, what if... that is all supposed to give us a scientific and credible background. This is simply not very good. Then we get to watch the movie we came for as they reach for the Stars Gate near Saturn (2001), simply called a worm-hole. Most of what follows suffers from the same sin of too much rational exposition in between irrational action by top skilled characters.In the end you are just a passive viewer not knowing if the whole movie added anything to the genre or just mixed pompous mankind stakes with routine Hollywood melodrama. With Solaris Tarkovski already had his own answer to the lack of human feeling in 2001, which Soderbergh remade. Anything less subtle about human feelings for an astronaut is trash. Nobody goes to watch a movie about The Future of Mankind and Serious Space Exploration while only expecting characters to be as emotionally unstable as in a soap opera.",5,4,9,29 December 2014
American Hustle," Over-hyped, barely worth 3 stars for the cast, 1 for art direction
","Quite frankly ranking this movie 4 stars is more than it's worth yet. I saw it coming, but couldn't believe my eyes as the whole story sluggishly and self-indulgently unfolded. It was a long time since I last wanted to walk out in the middle of a viewing.First there was this selling point of a 'cool', 'groovy' piece of film-making. Tarantino is very good at this but even for him it is a fine line between cool and wink-wink jokes and references - and self-references. On the cool side David O. Russell's Three Kings was really overrated yet. Also, 'cool' is mostly about dumb poor vocabulary.And then how can you make a 'cool movie' that lasts well over 2h? A Scorsese fresco (Taxi Driver, Ragging Bull, Godfellas and Casino) is not an achievement for your average director who thinks he's smart because he's hot on the market. American Hustle tries to dilute its over-long script with a mild teasing+flashback right from the start. But when the flashback gets started you begin to think - rings a bell, a good director, with a fine editor, keeps the audience from thinking: 'OMG! they are going all the way back to how everybody met (including some remembrance of Irving's youth...)!' Then the story drags and drags along every detail of a pretty simple plot, boring us stiff with the zoo of its characters. Sure this was a great cast but only the focus on Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams) is consistently deep to keep you rooting for her. Most of the rest is about flashy caricatures. Christian Bale cannot play emotions, as usual (the actor's studio caricature) but it's in line with his character, a character that would only work as a funny obnoxious a**hole.So it all comes down to this: is it a comedy? Not really. A thriller? Certainly not. Ensemble cast for a period piece? Sometimes. A satire? Of what? A nostalgia postcard? Nope.American Hustle is a typical case of a director pretty full of himself, who fall in love with his story and wanted to show us all his 'brilliant' ideas instead of constantly challenging them to know which kind of movie he was making.",4,10,18,16 February 2014
The Italian Job," OK heist
","As a heist movie The Italian Job is neither a noir heist, but could have been, nor a really suspenseful heist, but might have been. Instead they played along the line of the source material, the 1969 flick, and set up a movie about a cool bunch (minus the swinging sixties style).Hey, there's the rub. As a cool actioneer it works pretty well, much better than the original indeed since action then was thought as a big farandole joke in line with the rest of the movie. But they added other stuff around the heist in it: above all there is not one single big heist, it's more about a setup for the original idea of having minis speeding in narrow subway tunnels; then things that are not sparklingly cool also clutter up without adding much.To make it short without giving away plot points there's a line that says fine for a thief means 'Freaked-out Insecure Neurotic Emotional'. These are precisely the points that never come to fruition along the story although there's supposed to be a strong emotional background.Bottom line: OK movie that could have been much better paced (quite a few lull ends in it between the expected action, comic strip characterization), hence entirely forgotten the next day.",5,1,2,24 April 2008
"I, Robot"," Robotic and really not clever enough
","I had avoided this movie for over 10 years. My prejudice was it wasn't worth watching, I have just tested my prejudice and it stands firmer now that I have seen this very weak sci-fi endeavor.I, Robot mostly feels like a MOW, or bits of animated interludes in a video game. The SFX really make the movie cheap and artificial... robotic. Will Smith is OK, he can't do much to lift this humming electronic shell above ground, but the female sidekick is a bore. Lame casting is one thing, but a script that stays so 'PG-13, read back the order': that truly is a lethal sin. No wonder the rest of the script is just pedestrian and never brings anything genuinely gripping.As for direction I can only remember show-off shooting angles in a totally uninspired storytelling approach. I remember Dark City as a disturbing sci-fi experience, yet it seldom relied on SFX so I can only imagine that Alex Proyas got himself into something too big for his own creative camera here.",3,3,4,30 September 2015
Apocalypse Now," Near Hell, stir crazy
","I first saw Apocalypse Now on TV and it seemed I had forgotten it all except the fact that I didn't find it all that good. The higher the expectations, the deeper the let-down. This year the 'Redux' version has been released and it was time for giving it a second chance. The jungle edge appears on screen. A dusty frame. Then the sound, dust-erratic. Eventually the music heralding the end slices through the dust. To no avail: Jim Morrison's voice permanently settles the torpor of violence that encompasses the whole movie. With no exit. Neither in Saigon nor at the end of the river. The napalm reminds me of what was this movie about. The heavy flames swallowing the resigned trees, human beings at odds with it... this is simply not the typical quest you could easily remember. No Graal, no Lost Ark. You're not relieved to see the hero achieving his goal.From beginning to end the movie is top art. Coppola likes to shoot his main character telling his mind with few lines but trying to make do with more nervous characters. The Conversation, The Godfather, and even Dracula works that way. You might find it brilliant but you might as well find it boring. The new scenes in the 'Redux' version are not less brilliant (i.e. interesting for movie enthusiasts at least) but do they make the movie greater? Anyway it would have been a pity if bunnies and French colonials had not cast a new light on war Viet-Nam.",10,0,0,8 June 2001
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Great adaptation: faithful and powerful
","WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ADAPTATION I was amazed that people thought so much of the original adaptation. It was clearly not a good movie (caveat: I saw the TV version in two parts which is longer than the movie but still feels rushed and disjointed). Whatever you think of that Scandinavian movie you can't seriously say the main character, Mikael Blomqvist, was magnificently embodied. The actor had zero charisma, he felt so boring you couldn't buy he was passionate about his work (and women - and in turn his sex appeal was questionable). Noomi Rapace as Lisbeth Salander was good but not great and you could feel it was for lack of top-class directing skills in the Danish film-brewer.FAITHFUL TO THE BOOK Actually the first book in the Millennium trilogy is such a good thriller - it is really a top-tier page-turner that deserved to become a best-seller - that the story (featuring Lisbeth Salander as the most engaging character) is enough to have people feel they are watching something original, thus good.Stephen Zaillian's adaptation really does justice to the book and we really have to congratulate the producers and director David Fincher for not shortening significant parts of the original story. At over 2h30 the story is never slow, neither rushed. Most importantly Daniel Craig is a perfect Mikael Blomqvist (and I admit I don't like him as 007), Rooney Mara feels more fragile than Noomi Rapace and is thus much more touching.I am not a great fan of David Fincher but now his visual gusto is matched by great scripts (well, he earned that through lesser works I think) he does wonders. Clearly here you can tell the production sense and values were perfectly in tune with the original material, plus Fincher shoots the perfect pace, the perfect emotional tone as he directs Craig and Mara (and the supporting cast as well) to hit the high marks.Sole big blunder: an over-bloated and totally out-of-line opening credits sequence. This is not a super-hero movie or a saw gruesome horror flick: clearly here less - much less - would have been more. Credits displayed over an extended presentation of Mikael Blomqvist (possibly thru Salander's private eye) would have been way better. The fact is the only unfaithful bit is the English title (chosen by publishers) but there was really no urge to make it that explicit so soon in the movie.Now I am expecting a lot from Millennium II - The Girl who played with Fire. The book was boring, long digressions and obvious suspense with a multi-pronged investigation stalled for pages. Here the movie can even be better than the book, too bad they didn't shot it back-to-back with the first movie.",9,4,10,2 February 2012
Dark City," A good draft for The Matrix, but a little too gloomy
","Looks like Tim Burton's Gotham City with a much intricate Twilight Zone-like script. It's a pity the main character is not better embodied and the set up gives an overall impression of B-movie (like good Twilight Zone episodes). I think it mainly comes from the picturesque people living under. They seem to come straight out of some Comic and they bear quite ridiculous names (Mr. Hand, Mr. Quick, Mr. Memory - sorry that one was in The 39 steps).What did the Wachowski brothers do better?Implication: The Matrix designs our entire world, not just unlucky people who can no longer have their own memories.Identification: The hero has to be chased before we ever learn why he is the hero. Then he is given an illustrated explanation of why his gift is so important. Eventually he is taught to use his power. He is John Doe and he is told he's the best.Frightful villains: A villain with a top hat is ridiculous. A villain you would hardly notice in the street brings more fear to the screen once given a particularity. Special sunglasses and black suits are simple props - but they're quite a commonplace now.Adding action: ...and innovate. What could be a spectacular transcription of the hero's power ? How to shoot various confrontations with the villains without using the same opposition ?No flat ending: the hero does not get back to rags. It's over but he learned something he can't forget and just get along. He's stronger and that means something.",6,0,2,25 January 2001
Now You See Me," Lots of entertaining glitz but mostly empty
","... that is perfect for a summer popcorn movie where you just want to sit and enjoy the on screen action and the theatre AC. Now You See Me is really well done, it's swiftly directed and there are no odd parts, and I knew what kind of movie I was going to watch so I am not disappointed.On the other hand the movie did not surprise me, and the plot is mostly a gimmick you don't care about by the time the trick is revealed. The casting was great: gathering Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harelson... is a key factor of success here. These three are the most powerful and impressive performers of the lot, and Melanie Laurent comes just behind with a different kind of character that does help keep the story on track in between extravaganza scenes. Mark Ruffalo does the job but is not entirely convincing, yet I reckon the part was written in such a way that he must alternatively appear a funny fool and an a-hole, to end up looking a nice handsome dedicated copper... By far, not the easiest job on the lot.I was surprised Jesse Eisenberg received top billing. He must really be hot property after the Social Network, but frankly Woody Harelson is by far the best of the 4 horsemen. Eisenberg looks as if he is not able to play something else than the Mark Zuckerberg type. Isla Fisher has little to play with and is thus underused, as always alas. And there's also a fourth horseman who picks locks but is quite pellucid.All in all the movie runs very smoothly for its 115min runtime but it is mostly 'in your face' entertainment and will leave no mark as a clever or intriguing movie.",5,8,13,6 August 2013
Ocean's Eleven," Same untasty flick as Out of sight
","No inner life in this movie. Never you feel really more in the action than in your seat. In fact every single thing in Ocean's eleven is well done but on the whole it's dull.I had the same feeling after seeing Out of sight with Clooney. Perhaps Soderbergh doesn't know to shoot action movies. His directing skills are out of scope here. Would you dare to speak of chemistry between such key characters as Clooney's and Pitt's, Clooney's and Roberts'?Every new element in here falls flat for every scene is anecdotical; hence this set of anecdotical stories forms an heartless feature.",4,0,1,8 March 2002
Bridesmaids," Slow and unfocused comedy
","I can hardly find something interesting in one of the few movie I stopped watching after some 80 minutes. Good comedies know that you can't have the right rhythm with a total length far beyond the 90-minute mark. OK I knew it was a bad idea to get the 'Unrated version', i.e. some marketing ploy to make you feel you'll get an exclusive product when buying the DVD while it's only the original professional cut inflated by dozens of minutes that were originally thought useless (and most probably counter-productive).Still, at over 2 hours Bridesmaids is clearly overlong and you can tell it from the very start. Scenes lead to other scenes without the rhythm ever picking up. The lead is mostly pathetic, and it's rarely pathetic-funny, and even then the hurtfully pathetic annihilates the good jokes. With such a slow rhythm you also have plenty of time to see the ensemble cast is only made of one-dimensional characters.",3,2,3,9 September 2012
Non-Stop," Fine buildup, then the story has to crash-land somehow
","The good thing with action movies is that I am not expecting too much. My curiosity was adequately titillated, less than for Snakes on a Plane, but Non-Stop is definitely not in the 'tongue in cheek' category. On the one hand Liam Neeson is really good at being dead serious for 100min and on the other hand straight all thrills/no pun action is a difficult plane to land.The buildup is really good, you fasten your seat-belt and get into the story smooth and nice. But it is a really long stretch for your average suspension of disbelief. And Liam Neeson's character gradually loses its aura once we get the full swing from his heavy back-story to the clear situation in the plane. He is travelling business class and should really concentrate on suspects monitoring him here. Instead we get a man on the loose that is more a pawn in a malicious plan than the guy in charge.As an action movie it is not quite satisfying because we are kept wondering where the threat is coming from for too long, and we don't even want to believe in the various paranoid bursts. When the hijacker comes forward there only remains space for full throttle action, or as they say in the cockpit apply TOGA power: Take-off/Go Around. So we go around with a lame exposition of the hijacker's motive before routine action brings it all to a close.I wanted to watch a simple and effective action movie but Non-Stop only exists thanks to Liam Neeson (and Julianne Moore). Suspense and action are really poor and there is not real effort to make it consistent. Unfortunately it is more about the viewer being hijacked. I will check Unknown though for it can only be slightly better.",3,6,10,3 March 2014
28 Days Later...," Episodic and exploitative cheap flick
","There's hardly one good idea in the script. The prologue sets it all: it's ugly and it seems you've seen it umpteen times on TV. Though some images of the deserted London in the beginning are really good. The rest with the 'living dead' is bland: it's been done umpteen times in a better way; I mean scarier, truly involving, really gut-grabbing.The last part in the castle with the soldiers is kinda ridiculous: THE upper crust of episodic and chaotic script shooting.When you've got nothing to shoot, don't make movies: simple, ain't?Over.",2,1,2,15 June 2003
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Flimsy script, stock characters and ape CGI galore
","I am surprised Rise of the Planet of the Apes raised so much excitement for so many viewers. Maybe it looks original or fashionable nowadays to have a hero from a dominated species confronting our economically violent human world. Like Avatar, this would be Disney with a (not too profound) message.As for the movie itself, it's genuinely boring.James Franco plays the perfectly bland cutesy but single (living home with daddy) scientist with a conscience. Experiments going bad because of greedy research corporations is nothing new, it has been done nicely umpteen times, and this time it's only a basic setting with no substance.Apes are good, OK, but not when they are shown a-moving around in the air, across trees or buildings: movements are linear (something know as the conveyor-belt effect for CGI-enhanced elements moving on ground level), there is simply not the right amount of acceleration. Now the most interesting part of the whole movie is in the refuge, but even then the storyline is far from good. Intercuting with James Franco's nice boy's life prevents the tension from building up, and anyway the refuge wardens are such worn-out stock characters that it cheapens the whole sequence.Icebox logic last: when a film is that bad, you're bound to have the time to think how stupid the whole story is. I can take the premise that a drug will help brain-cells regenerate and that apes can thus become as intelligent as humans in the blink of an eye. Scientifically this is stupid, but when you go to the movies there is the famed suspension of disbelief which the viewer offers to the movie-makers and it works when the movie do delivers. Now I wrote about clichés, yet they can be funny, if only the movie doesn't aim to be dead-serious (or doesn't take funny for granted in a spoof). But the story of Rise of the Planets of the Apes really goes nowhere. In the end the staging of the great battle Apes Vs. Humans is ridiculous. There is no sense of immediacy, so it feels dumb that only a dozen cops and one chopper confront the Apes hours after they stormed the city (yes they do take the time to visit SF, they're not just moving rapidly to leave the city).The screenwriter here certainly didn't get brain-enhancing drugs. This movie is much less interesting than Conquest of the Planet of the Apes which was already a low-budget mediocre prequel-sequel. But the script somewhat helped to forget most of the movie took place with actors-dressed-as-apes walking on a concrete 70s plaza, whereas here the big budget, good and bad CGI, only makes the flimsy script hurting more",3,5,14,3 October 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Boring, boring, boring. Self-complacent ramblings about nothing
","To say that this movie is self-complacent would be a gigantic understatement. As gigantic maybe as Tarantino's memory, overloaded with scores of details that he doesn't care to sort out. So he unloads them in bulk. The result : it's like you go to a promising party but end up cornered most of the night by some drunk guy who absolutely wants to share his opinions about everything.Right from the start you get vignette after vignette, self-indulgent, overlong spoof sequences that bog down the main narrative. What with all the stuff Tarantino has learnt about movies he can't shorten exposition to clever ellipses ? Once upon a time I thought he was very good with dialogue, but I guess it is no fun to toil and write fine lines (no just snappy one-liners from time to time) when Sony will greenlight anything you want to shoot.Once upon a time in Hollywood does not have a plot. It is the New Wave auteur in Tarantino who does not think he needs a plot. He has a couple of characters, a dozen anecdotes and the rest is talent. Self-conscious talent, lazy talent, talent isolated in the middle of a creative process. More like naked skills, each trying separately to express its full potential.The hero and his sidekick are losers: how do you build a story around losers ? You need rhythm and some kind of McGuffin (wasn't it all there in Pulp Fiction?), not some vague exploration of the meaning of life. The plot is limited to the draft premise: a has-been TV actor and his stunt double cope with reality in Hollywood around the time of the Manson Family murders.
The backdrop of the murders is the only narrative asset. We are teased all along, we even have an extensive reconstitution of life at the Spahn Ranch... all this just to toy around and end with the kind of ultra-violent carnival that Tarantino fans seem to revere.
Clearly the challenge of mentioning the sordid Tate-LaBianca murders of August 1969 was not only above Tarantino's mental ability, but grossly using background anecdotes from it as fodder for his inspiration was within his moral scope.As always I am judging this movie on its merits from a movie enthusiast point of view. But Tarantino is much more than a movie enthusiast. He is a guttonous movie fanatic. He is a guru with followers who let themselves be impressed, just like with Charles Manson. Many more followers than Charles Manson; fortunately Tarantino followers are only trained to see the fun in violence.",4,183,323,20 October 2019
Get Out," Works on a basic level but covers too much territory
","As an horror/thriller movie it works pretty well. It is very well shot, very well acted but the whole story is made obvious way too soon to keep us scared by the whole setup. Said differently what is really going on is way too technical, mundane in itself to keep the movie at the same level of anguish, horror, fantasy...I discussed it with a friend and he gave me a very good explanation of the subtext, ie. the social commentary. Most reviewers mistook the premise for a take on Racism 3.0 while it is definitely about the appropriation of Black Culture.Nobody is racist in this movie, they just overtly envy Blacks. This is just the opposite sin, the materialist stance that views other people as a way to enrich your life without giving something back. This is not ugly racism, this is only class egoism. This would be the same with the same affluent WASPs having a paternalistic behaviour with poor whites (there are movies about this: Rich bored guy goes out to have fun with simple peasants then goes back to his comfortable condo with a year-worth of shrink realization). Only here WASPs have a very specific history of poaching on new frontiers and appropriating Black Culture.So yes, despite its strengths and original premise Get Out covers too much territory from horror to thriller, fantasy and social commentary. My guess is the social commentary is lost for most... except black people but it made for an eerie backdrop which all the same mesmerized most of the viewers.",6,1,3,20 June 2017
Drive," Overblown simplistic writer's fantasy
","So this was the movie to watch these days. An asocial hero hiding a heart of gold and ultra-violence under apparent dumbness. He is not even slightly interesting, he doesn't talk, he lives in his little inner world of cars and precision mechanics, an economy-class emotional bubble that can burst into something relentless.Ah yes they brought to life the superhero next door, the kind of monster living only in the brains of writers. Bad writers that is. Writers that will happily confuse nothingness with rich inner substance. You want a specific car stunt for $500? Just ask the superhero driver. He needs no careful planning, it's all in his veins. Have some trouble with the local Mafia? Head-on collision is the solution, the silent boy can certainly write off a couple of big mouths and settle it all. Seems some director found the story compelling and convenient though. And viewers bought that sh*, which is most disheartening given the level of gore graphic and gratuitous ultra-violence.The nihilistic trend sells well as artsy gutsy stuff these days. The Coen bros dood it, and it's now a real consummate genre from Cronenberg's self-inflicted History of Violence to There Will Be Blood. Adding the F-word in movies was an artistic endeavour years ago, now it seems that violence, especially dumb violence, is the way to show off how much more gripping you can do with less substance.",2,36,74,24 October 2011
Unknown," Loose storyline, you never really get the sense of someone fighting to get his life back
","I guess anyone deprived of his identity would feel shocked and be willing to do anything to get his life back. In Unknown there is a lot of passivity all around from Martin Harris (Liam Neeson). I do not know if the book was better at this but on the big screen you spend more time waiting with the protagonist than watching him actually fighting to solve the issue.You get a sense of despair but it is a mainstream movie so this development is minimal and entirely left to Liam Neeson's acting skills - which have been stretched to the point where you may have grown tired of with all the Taken-like flimsy thrillers that do rely on him to flesh up dumb archetypes.There is a bunch of fine actors here but the movie is totally uninteresting. The storyline only gets us from a first part where we have no clue about the solution to the final part where everything is gradually exposed - without Martin Harris ever fighting for any part, everything is just thrown at him 'ex machina', in due time.And worst of all the solution is boring, it feels like a plot written by a 12 year old, and doesn't look any better in moving pictures. Non-stop by the same star/director team is equally unimpressive, with the same loose script approach that quickly undermine the potential for suspense and tense action.",3,6,9,21 March 2014
Ex Machina," Clever premise and fine cinematography
","Clever premise and fine cinematography are a good starting point. And if the movie doesn't reach beyond to create a compelling storyline, this automatically results in a whole lot of self-indulgence. It is the pitfall of many a young director who has earned some accolades for early efforts. Few are those who can see beyond the warm sycophantic hum-buzz and look at themselves in the mirror to see how much hard work they still can hammer in their careers.Ex Machina is clearly an interesting premise, a very clever one for a low-budget independent production. The location and cinematography are great too. On top of this you have one hell of a gigantic flaw any aspiring screenwriter is bound to know: the main character is both weak AND passive. Since the movie is already designed as a very linear story cut up in 6-7 days of 'work' (that is, a repetitive endeavour even if something gradually builds up), this does run against the amount of suspense and thrills the viewer is experiencing.So if you scratch below the surface of all the clever talk about AI there only remains a weak movie that actually feels like a brilliant short movie blown up to feature length.",4,2,4,14 November 2015
Children of Men," Good, not great for lack of a more elaborate storyline
","Children of Men is a directorial achievement, no question about it. Alfonso Cuaron made the choice of a documentary-like approach, and this is extremely well done. Sequence shots with the camera moving with the characters, and with lots of action and extras all around: kudos.Now if you set aside how it's done, and how good the cast is, you have a pretty flimsy storyline. The main character (Clive Owen) is only reacting to events, he is only a reluctant hired activist. Too much depth for this character is sprinkled here and there without leaving us time to empathise and eventually root for him.OK the dystopian reality is nicely done, but it's only a very grim background and action is reduced to characters running in front of this very background over and over again. Science fiction, social commentary are not just about finding a nice historical and sociological backdrop. Here is the big flaw in the script: the action, and the hope it is supposed to foster, feels very episodic. Just think of it: the best scenes are those with 2 characters given a real dimension by talented actors. Julianne Moore has something to display in front of the passive Clive Owen character, then it's Michael Caine and it is a real pleasure (and relief) to get to enjoy him again later.All the 'apocalyptic' end is very well done but the movie is stalled from the start in the same way the car is in a very funny scene (was it really intentional? Could not be actual relief for the characters in the middle of action + depressing times). Actually the movie goes nowhere and never picks up speed. Director Cuaron succeeded in his technical endeavour but the rest feels empty because he confused visually gripping context and compelling story-line.",7,3,4,4 September 2012
Mulholland Drive," Magnificent directing but a Lynch-hokum ending
","It's not so easy to get in the film. You have the time to make the most of the frames, the actresses... the directing to put it in a nutshell. Lynch builds several parallel stories round the main one and it pays off as several very good scenes: a funny one (the two guys discussing in the office or how to commit a clean murder), a very good one about acting (my personal favorite) and a very hot one (for that one I would perhaps forgive Lynch for all the mess he adds near the end).Unfortunately when you feel you like the story (that is when Lynch develops the main story without digression) it's blown by what I call Lynch-hokum. Something those who won't go back and watch Eraserhead are sure to dislike. It's like a mess in some very perturbed artist's brain. Something that doesn't interest me until it makes a masterpiece.For Mulholland Drive to be a masterpiece it would have to change for a less heavy-elliptic ending. As for me I don't care to be among those fans of Lynch who can't explain you this ending but just repeat he is a genius with popping eyes. If what Lynch wants to tell in the movie is too complex, well he can take more time or find some writer to finish a story he doesn't know how it shall come to an end.Overall a disappointment (as a full-fledged movie experience not as a Lynch movie - Eraserhead is very really much more annoying) on account of the last 20 minutes.",7,1,2,24 November 2001
8 Mile," Sounds true: that's big enough yet
","The story itself is not thoroughly interesting or deeply engaging. But it's well directed, well paced and the focus is really well thought. In fact there was much worse to be feared as a vehicle for Eminem.People living and craving for hope in gloomy suburbs will find it even more engaging but for the others it will simply sound true as nothing seems to be too obviously cinematographically challenged.Anyway if the comparison makes sense to you let's say Eminem's albums are much better than 8 mile alone.",7,0,0,17 February 2003
From Dusk Till Dawn," Teenage bad*ss heroes
","You know the love of Quentin Tarantino for B-movies, even exploitation movies, so you can't expect too much from this one. Robert Rodriguez shoots it fine, although you can feel in the quiet moments, the 'quasi lulls', that it was not really his movie.What's very good in From Dusk Till Dawn is the dialog. Tarantino is definitely a master movie speech writer. He may steal from the ton of movies he has digested, he, the mad movie-hungry monster, he does it really fine, as a real connoisseur, not as a low-life grave-digger.What's really bad in the movie? The sick violence meant to be entertaining. Rich Gecko is a sicko and Tarantino thinks he is being funny. It's horrendous to depict such a degree of realistic violence tongue in cheek. Seth Gecko is supposed to be cleaner, while no smarter, yet that doesn't even it out. If that's the way it was intended then Seth Gecko is a bad excuse for his brother's excesses. The part in the desert where the body count goes way up is much more gore than the exposition with the Gecko bros but it's only cheap teenage stuff. You may feel it's dull as I do, or enjoy it because you like cheap; the fact is: sick realistic violence in the beginning is not washed out by the funky carnage that makes the bulk of the movie.Ironically enough, the disturbing start was more interesting than the contrived party in the Mexican desert. The last shot was great though.",3,2,6,14 July 2008
The Adjustment Bureau," Lovely romance marred by an abysmal premise
","How telling! I picked up this movie on VOD yesterday, thinking I had skipped it when it was released and actually I had gone to watch it but had only the faintest recollection.Obviously the movie was not very good. Worse than that, there was absolutely nothing interesting and new in it. Granted the romance is okay, but it is only the starting point. The whole premise, that Adjustment Bureau is a failure. Basically it is about dead-serious Men in Black, so you've got a pompous metaphysical backdrop that bogs down the entire movie (obviously since it is the premise from Philip K. Dick's short story). This is a similar mistake as the one they made with Dark City: this is not sci-fi enough or fantasy enough.Seriously who thought there was room for a movie, let alone a good one, about a police force with absolute power on the course of our lives? The moment the hero is told about this the whole story falls flat because it is a goddamn gigantic hole that they would let him know without resetting him the minute after, and even if they thought he was worth the dare it would take sloppiness over sloppiness from the AAA+ uptight Adjustment crew to let a prominent profile slip through its claws. A hero chased by some obscure force, this could make a fine noir movie, but a clear 'Hats-n-Doors' overwhelming organisation??? There simply is no story.",4,2,5,6 March 2017
Friends with Benefits," Crisp dialogue makes this RomCom quite enjoyable but...
","... Friends with Benefits can't run fast enough into the very clichés it wants to make fun of. It is like a producer is steering the project into the tightly packaged product zone while he had writers with more creativity than was allowed/needed.The crisp dialogue is really what makes the movie stand out IMO since I would not say that the chemistry between Milla Kunis and Justin Timberlake is more than adequate. Actually the setback of this crisp dialogue is the fast delivery and the impression of having fast delivery puppets rather than fine characters. That is a directorial issue: how to keep a fine comedic pace without letting down the characters in stand-up gig mode? I appreciated the script was somewhat original in the background but the LA sequence, which should have been the high point, is a ridiculous let down full of stock characters/situations and comedic action bogged down in the middle. From there ending is painfully dragging its feet.Not bad, has fine creative inroads, but never quite makes it above the level of a very conservatively clichéd RomCom.",5,0,1,7 January 2014
Blood Diamond," Good intentions, average movie
","Going a little further than just displaying Africa's doomed fate, bringing more than routine characters, telling us a story about people before it is about politics and economics... in all three directions Blood Diamond is weak.Edward Zwick's work brings no emotion, no suspense, to a story that is already too episodic and blended with on-the-nose dialogue. The actors try to make us believe in their stories, but they're one-dimension characters with some stock back-stories to make up for true flesh and bones. Djimon Honsou's part is the one that works best: it is simple alright, yet it never comes near to filling the flatness and predictability of 'Big Boy' DiCaprio's nice and tidy mercenary.Fortunately the location scouting was great, and Jennifer Connelly is gorgeous although only a part of the glorious scenery. On the whole, a very forgettable movie with good intentions (honest or not, we shall never know).",4,5,12,14 April 2009
Singin' in the Rain," Not only a great musical. A great comedy too !
",I'm not a fan of musicals but I always wanted to see that movie. And not only because I had already seen the title song scene or Malcolm McDowell's violent choreography.More than the illuminating joy and buoyancy of all the dance scenes I enjoyed the funny plot about the hard shift from silent movies to talkies. It's amazing to think it was written accordingly to the songs chosen ! I like that exuberant creativity !,10,1,4,3 February 2001
Avatar," Ultra-linear. Only 3D and subtext make it a very nice experience
","Avatar keeps you waiting for marvelous images to emerge from the screen. That's the main reason why this ultra-linear/flat 2h40 story would make an interesting show. Every spectator wants to be surprised, so the National Geographic/Pandora Discovery Channel first part is enough to make us wait and watch through child's eyes.Then the story is mainly against militarism, imperialism and about people living in harmony with their likes and the Nature. So it's not the usual heavy-handed big brawn and dull apocalyptic show of über-blockbusters. Nevertheless go find one interesting character in Avatar. To me, Neytiri is the most interesting, yet she's only the CGI rendition of a real actress (Zoe Saldana)! On the other hand Sam Worthington's avatar looks bland. In fact the whole main character is bland, passive and one-dimensional. Funnily enough Sam Worthington's character in Terminator: Salvation, very close to Jake Sully in terms of storyline, is a much deeper character...Thus there are reasons to be disappointed by Avatar if you were expecting a groundbreaking masterpiece. Seeing it in 3D is an important experience for whoever is interested in movies and new technologies; the experience ranges from nice to very nice provided you can appreciate all the good work and stop short of being addicted to the images.Simply put you can't fall for Avatar because its storyline is just too linear and its characters also just too one-dimensional. It took 12 years for James Cameron to be able to make Avatar and he wasn't able to write something better? More accurately, since he is not renown for his perfectly and subtly crafted screenplays I'd say he missed the opportunity to team up with some good writer(s). Cameron has reached such a status it's difficult for him to collaborate in a creative department he thinks he masters and thus the real joy for him must have been the creative collaboration on the technically challenging parts. As a result he put more energy in the visual creation of Avatar, not in the writing. Another very weak point is the score by James Horner: 12 years after Titanic he couldn't come up with something better that doesn't constantly brings memory of his previous score for Cameron. I suppose this shows just how much James Cameron was unable to provide the necessary amount of energy to the creative departments other than visual imagery.Now, about the visual imagery, it's nice but only a rehash of Miyazaki's visual and poetic creations: Princess Mononoke (mainly), Nausicaä, Castle in the sky. Cameron didn't improve at all on these references.Conclusion: I'll not go and watch Avatar again. There's nothing interesting beyond the 3D experience so I suspect it must be far less interesting, even boring, to watch in 2D.",6,4,9,6 January 2010

Watching this is OK if you don't mind some live animated Disney picture, but really this is a gigantic budget for a very little movie. Red-scare B-movies from the 50s where much more thrilling, starting with Invaders from March if you're looking for a story told from the point of view of a kid.Kudos to the marketing team who succeeded in erasing the fact that it was a kid movie in most of the promotional material, starting with the -mysterious if unoriginal- poster. So don't mix it up with Joel Schumacher's 8mm if you intend to select a movie for children)",3,0,1,20 November 2011
Limitless," Starts out really great, then it's just a mediocre thriller
","I guess the script follows the book it is based on and the producers were shy about improving on the source material. Visually they did a great job, but the story turns into a no-brainer after the first act.Limitless starts out very well though I must admit while I am fed up with the 'struggling writer' cliché - a clearly over-represented population in movies. Our Faustian hero could have been anything, from lacklustre student to small-business entrepreneur, it doesn't matter. The main point is about using drugs to enhance your capabilities, to raise above the fray, to 'become successful', to realise oneself... and what is the trade-off, the after effects? Obviously those points are too philosophical in this story, the side-effects are vaguely used as a plot turn and then the ending simply rushes a solution to forget about it. So to me it is a major failure not to set the story inside a dystopian/noir context. What further cheapens the fine Faustian premise is the 'criminal' subplot. Hero decides to make a lot of money for his big projects so he just goes to borrow money from some shabby thug. That is really clever. And he just forgets to pay him back, and then his big project is to become a drug-addicted President with the brains to change the world.One thing is sure, the writers didn't have NZT at their disposal.",6,1,2,21 January 2014
Inside Man," A suspension of challenging approach for both talent and story
","Suspension of disbelief is your classic benevolent no prejudices first contact with a movie. That is what a good director can expect to build up a story even from a mediocre script. Or an average director can get away with it if he has a good story to start with.Inside Man got a very fine casting. Does that make a great cast? Well there is a tipping point in the movie where sheer stature and charisma can no longer make up for the weak characterisation. A nice cop (Denzel Washington), a (marginally) violent yet clean and sharp heist mastermind (Clive Owen) and a bunch of stock supporting characters (Jodie Foster as the ambiguous bitching lawyer type, Christopher Plummer as the polished evil grey-suited - but quite clumsy - über-class banker, etc.) doesn't really make a great cast.Now if there was a great story, no one would mind enjoying these cartoonish characters. But the story is far from pop-corn cartoonish, it really takes itself seriously. Suspension of disbelief: low battery.And Spike Lee does take himself seriously. Let's say he is only a bit over the hedge with the in-your-face statement by Clive Owen at the beginning. It sets the bar high, without being really clever, but OK... Now, all the over-hanging shots and the ridiculous trolley-shot at the end really make it a big fat failure in directing vista.Well a director must be short-sighted to take so seriously (I mean deep dork serious) this screenplay. Lots of reviewers have pointed out the flaws: again it is not the (big) flaws that count but the impotence at channelling suspension of disbelief into something that hangs OK.In the end, cinematically challenged audiences will only see it as a clever story with great actors, and actually no talent ever got harmed during the shooting. Nothing got properly challenged as to get the best from everyone and every situation. They are happy they shot this in little more than a month. Good for them, but the result is a weak movie further crippled by its stance as a very clever heist machine.",3,0,4,5 March 2013
Zombieland," B-looting: zombie in Hollywood means cool badass
","Basically what spoils the fun for me in Zombieland is that you get the production values of a big movie while the storyline feels like a B-movie. At best.I guess this means Hollywood just kneels to pick up some low concept and try to pimp it up like a cool badass movie. I blame Tarantino for that trend: B-looting. He went on to forage it when he didn't feel too self-assured he could do more mature stuff than something always on the verge of self-spoofing.Zombieland starts out OK with an angle, an editing rhythm that makes up for the lack of originality (post-apocalyptic zombieland). But soon enough it becomes all too easy for the guys. Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) is too much of a caricature of a badass with no brains. With him the movie veers off and there simply remains no prize to keep your eyes on. Boy meets girl? This is so lightly presented that it looks like it was designed for a Disney cartoon.By the time they get to BM's mansion in Hollywood (see, no spoilers here) the story already was going nowhere, with very little to fear from the zombies (hey they always have an arsenal with infinite ammo close at hand and manage to drive between crowded spots). The party at BM's is a weird pause. Or more accurately a poseur's pause. BM's joke is half-funny and they stretch it to the max... to the point they kill the joke and just decide to move on with the trodden carnival finale.Dimwits may like this stuff, but the truth is they guys who committed that were too lazy to come up with an interesting story and just self-satisfied with their ambition for an half-baked cool zombie ride.",5,3,5,14 April 2015
The Departed," Nice build-up and terrible let-down
","The post-Casino Scorsese is a director who has nothing more to prove and seems to be content with shooting big budgets that fall into line with big concessions.The Departed feels much like an impersonal movie and the most Scorsese-like feature in it are the sudden bursts of violence. Violence clearly has an important status in Scorsese's filmography, were it only because it is not gratuitous violence but the cathartic display of the animal part in male characters. But at some point in the storytelling violence hurls the rest of The Departed to hit the rail. Too much, no longer meaning anything.For me the big flaw in The Departed that makes it yet another over-bloated Scorsese flick is the fact he was compelled to deal with two intertwined story lines. Yet obviously the Scorsese hero is not the clean bland Sullivan (Matt Damon) but the grim edgy Costigan (DiCaprio). The Sullivan part has nothing to do in a Scorsese movie, it's a stereotypical part which only hijacks half the runtime from the real guy. Star egos? Matt Damon's agent negotiating to have equal time with DiCaprio? Anyway it's a sorry result.What makes the great Scorsese's movies so great is the flow, the fact we have a voice-over that rushes us into the action, into the heart and soul of the characters. Here Sullivan is so uninteresting they had to put a prologue to set his character, and the screen time he gets only distracts the story-telling from gaining momentum with Costigan's inner struggle.On the whole The Departed would be a good thriller (and a minor Scorsese stint) but the ending makes it a very disappointing one with its deus ex machina conclusion. Never thought Scorsese could be able to deliver such a pitiful executive-like busted mess of an ending. I felt it coming as the storyline was screeching with four-reels not to take the path of fatality, not making it to convert a nice ensemble piece to stay more with Costigan, our genuine tragic hero, the only one we truly care for.UPDATE: I have now seen Infernal Affairs, the original Chinese movie, and the only points where the Americans have improved on the original material are 1/a better characterization for DiCaprio and Nicholson's parts 2/a slower rhythm more suitable to this story yet 50 min in excess (150' vs. 100') are twice too much. Infernal Affairs looks a bit rushed to fit in the 90-100' format and I have to admit the error of not insisting enough to flesh up the undercover cop was already the main problem in the original (we have very little time to feel the cop spent 10 years under cover) so The Departed has very little to be praised for. Even more so pumping up the Godfather part with the Nicholson impersonation proves detrimental, in the end, to the whole movie.",5,1,3,9 December 2006
Shooter," A good action movie which doesn't seriously attempt to get above B status
","You see how bad a producer is when you have a hefty (A) budget and the result feels more like a B movie. The production values in Shooter are excellent in terms of action scenes and locations, but when it comes to characters and 'plot finesse' this could as well have been a direct-to-video pot-boiler.The best and the worse are bundled, as a summary of things to come, in the fine prologue: it does establish pretty well the work of a shooter and his pointer as an excellent plot device, but only a couple of minutes into the movie the pointer gets a picture of his fiancée out of his notebook. You don't need to have seen that many movies to guess what will happen to him in the next few minutes.The story is very exciting and the script offers great action sequences, but in between the narrative is not very tense - especially as we switch between the hero, the FBI agent(s) and the private contractor guys, in the pivotal moments after the Philadelphia plot. The ending also feels disjointed and in your face: after the grand-scale shootout there is no longer a sense of immediacy and emergency, it's only about putting that scene here to tell this and that and bring the whole thing to a close.If action is the best part of Shooter, characters are really the weakest. Everyone is either wooden or one-dimensional - sometimes both - so absolutely nobody shines in there! Mark Whalberg is as stiff as ever and his character doesn't even allow him to be more than this massive sharpshooting nerd while Danny Glover is nowhere edgy enough for his part. And at best the rest of the cast is giving the most out of the flimsy secondary characters.A good action movie, to watch once despite its poor development, perfect to keep you awake during a 2h flight.",6,0,0,7 January 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," Hu-hu, let's have a redeeming debate over this
","It's a lovely story with nice guys (you'd love to make friends with) and bad guys (you'd love to hate). OK. Let's say it's the kind of entertaining stuff that makes you feel good... provided you are lenient enough to find it deep, genuinely humane, etc.So you think it's a wonderful movie? Welly welly well. Maybe I need to tell you something about cinema. [Don't take it as a lesson from an infatuated Frenchman but simply as the point of view of a cinema lover.] Cinema is about images made emotions. Hence astoundingly good movies are way above the usual recipe: (good story + good story-telling) + (good characters + good actors) = good movie.As long as it was, never did I felt emotions through images in The Shawshank Redemption. The good characters/actors/story-telling... had already killed every single spark of emotion. Especially the deadpan voice-over narration.Bottom line: Shawshank Redemption is beautifully bundled, not beautifully crafted. Guess why Tim Robbins directed Dead Man Walking the year after.",6,1,4,6 November 2002
1408," Well done nowhere near impressive
","Stephen King is fantastic writer, he can take the simplest idea and build a whole story around to keep you captivated as you live the book. On the big scream most of the writer's talent vanishes: it is only one depiction of a story for which you would have build your own images based on the author's words. And the images summoned are countless times more powerful than the clean ones an adaptation will patch together.1408 illustrates this point perfectly: the horror in room 1408 is beyond what the hero had imagined because it was not about some random ghost or spooky decoration, but really about his own personal tremors building up deep-rooted anguish and fear. In a book you would make up images that will really put you under the skin of the hero, in a movie... it is only a movie.So 1408 is not bad, it's just that it cannot create the same claustrophobic tension as a good horror book. Visually the average user is too well-used to those haunted places' set of supernatural happenings.",6,1,2,30 August 2014
The Emperor's New Groove," Action and weak characters
","I'm not a fan of Disney's and I do not think this one is a major picture. Emperor Kuzco switches from selfish disdain to a more friendly position in a wink. Pacha is a dull peasant standing for morals as the perfect American father (and quite henpecked too). Yzma is ugly but not so powerful a villain. Thinking that Disney's are for under 12, I can't see the point for children in watching a picture where good and evil are so weakly depicted. Anyway the storyline is stronger for everything coming to action. But it's an usual trap to focus on action and hang loose on characterization. Perhaps children only deserve a bundle of good images with rhythmic action and that's it.",5,0,4,29 April 2001
Casino Royale," The Bourne Holdem Highlights (or Bond stirred with pathos)
","We're far away from the original 007 concept. Bond is now a very sad character, more exactly a pathos-leaden character. Sure this was the basis of Ian Fleming's novel, but the 15-odd first installments in the series had established something else. Humor perfectly blended with action and engaging stories. So good a recipe it was the most successful franchise ever (did the word franchise ever come up before Goldfinger clearly established that all this was not merely a transient craze?).Now 007 is closer to that poor boy Jason Bourne, always running, fighting his guts out and on and on... never getting something because that all depends on how long the producers are thinking about duplicating the recipe. Did I mention that Martin Campbell is, at most, a shrewd journeyman compared to Paul Greengrass? That should be a detail for most people but, well, that does matter. Even if Jason Damon-Bourne is a bland character, Paul Greengrass saves it. Daniel Craig brings a lot of charisma to his characterization but he's no funny man. Smiles are work for him, the same way his impressive body suggests lots of iron pumping while the previous Bond all had a natural force which was anecdotally physical. They were kind of super-heroes with gentlemen-thieves super powers.Yes I do think Daniel Craig is miscast. He may be a very fine actor, but he looks too concerned to fit in the Bond shoes. Yet with all the 'refocusing' Casino Royale displays, the producers clearly deserving all the blaming, I can only say, like an old bag, that 'Bond movies are no longer as good/funny/entertaining as they used to be'. Hey maybe it's just that times have changed and that the producers were very smart to follow the trends of... well the trends described in some marketing study. That must be it. Anyway I do think Casino Royale is a poor movie. Not only a lame installment in the franchise, but really an uninteresting movie, save the fact it stimulates me to try and understand what may be going on in the nine-digit industry at the moment.Bonuses:The prologue sequence is the worst (i.e. pointless, cheap, ugly...) in 45 years of Bond regular deliveries.The subsequent Titles Sequence is also the worst I can remember. Did they pay digital scam artists to throw up that stuff?Action scenes: Ô the magnificent God of overflowing Action! OK guys, that rocks, but don't you think there's a slight problem in your movie when the hero stops moving like superman? Doesn't he look like a stuffed puppet? Action should have a meaning, it must be combined with suspense, else action for action's sake leads to a movie that looks like a tour de force patchwork. And 2h30 of patchworking is more than one can stand, so please go toy with last year visual ideas at MTV's and leave Bond movies to adults.",3,10,16,13 February 2008
Amélie," Happiness come true to screen
","It's all about happiness and how a few images can make it real and near palpable. With Amélie Jeunet fully succeeds to light the magic in life throughout his gallery of portraits. The way he deals with the context to make it unreal may be disturbing but it's his poetic license to make up the dull ends of life. Of course if you don't feel like being happy you will rant you're fed up with those dreamlike images. You should have known French directors do not only shoot distressing movies. Some of them are so ambitious as to make movies for more people than a bunch of ill-fitting brains.The simplest of stories leave much room for creativity to develop most beautiful images to eventually form magical movies. Movies that make you feel so well that you wonder how it is possible to deal about life with just a dozen reels. Jeunet distills a little nostalgia and a mellifluous composition of other simple ingredients. The result is so great, marvelous that there is no point in analyzing the making. Questioning Amélie Poulain's achievement is the same as to say 'I don't like the colors' 'I don't like the characters' 'I don't like the story'. When you're happy you don't wonder why and there's no point in asking for more than what you get. But afterward you ought to be grateful for the wonderful time (and rooting for more) while the non-happy are still trying to word their own private impotence.",9,1,3,29 April 2001
Munich," Minor Spielberg: heavy sentimentalism doesn't blend well with dark real life background
","It's a long time since Spielberg has lost his primal directing skills. Not that he has become a bad director, but it seems to me that all his movies since E.T. are plagued with heavy sentimentalism. The wünder kid of the 70s benefits from almost unlimited backup and this makes all his subsequent films big clean streamlined products, and no longer lovely chiseled flicks for a wide audience. Actually I do think all that makes highbrow critics describe Spielberg as an auteur is the exact bs he revels in and develops to the point of heavy sentimentalism.In Munich, there is the protracted hero, a good and sentimental Israeli patriot. Because with Spielberg private life or patriotic duty are loaded with the same sore sentimentalism. It's not something than tells the viewer about the hero, it's just stock Spielberg sentimentalism, meant to give the audience its fair share of base emotions. Spielberg nonetheless tries to avoid depicting Isrealis as the absolute good guys and Palestinians as the Arch Evilmen. But he is so at a loss for a firm viewpoint... All he is able to give us is this dumb 'nothing's pitch black, nothing's bright white' tautological storyline. This is sentimentalism for dummies, no wonder the movie goes nowhere. It's just a routine spy-job movie. Munich as very little to do with this, and that's why we are fed with this protracted rendering of the Munich tragedy spliced in 4-odd parts and spilled over the main 2h30 course.The casting and acting are really good, but the locations, sets and photography give too much of a surreal aspect to the story. It looks like a dream, never too close to a real nightmare (contrary to what the hero is supposed to experience): Spielberg sentimentalism is totally at odds with the subject matter. Interesting subject, wrong execution < wrong director.",4,0,2,27 April 2010
Heat," Such a shame...
","The only interest of that movie, the hook, would have to be the confrontation between two major actors of the past 25 years. Nothing happens during most of the 3-hour blue-filtered feature. Save two dynamic action scenes (hour#1 into hour#2 then hour#2 into hour#3).The confrontation comes somewhere in between the shoot-outs and today, almost 7 years after the release, I only remember the Heinz tomato ketchup bottle on the table. The case is both characters are wooden. Where on hearth is it possible to do so bad with de Niro and Pacino?Need I speak about the dull TV-standard ending?Go back directing Starsky & Hutch episodes Mr Mann: I expect less, I don't waste 3 hrs and I save my buck.",2,9,23,16 August 2002
Saboteur," Run-of-the-mill Hitchcock
","Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I had yet to discover and I was less than half-overwhelmed. The French title 'La Cinquième colonne' (i.e. The Fifth Column, a very evocative phrase for underground spying and sabotage organizations) set my expectations quite high as did the images of the finale on top of the Statue of Liberty.Basically Saboteur is as much light-hearted as were The 39 steps (note this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title) but it lacks most of the humor (so the characters are rather down to earth) and it's definitely not as fast paced. As a chase movie across the USA from LA to NY Saboteur drags its feet from sequence to sequence. The sequence at the villain's lovely ranch? Lovely ranch, lovely villain but pretty tame on the whole, it doesn't really add up to nothing. The meeting with the blind man, the mixing with Circus people, the Soda City sequence, the NY ball sequence? They fall flat, bringing in more characters with very little added suspense value.One big problem I can point out is the relationship between the leads Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane which is not building up as with Robert Donat and Madeleine Caroll in The 39 steps. Hence the whole narrative structure is floating, depending on the addition of new scenes. And new scenes only bring us nearer the end since it's not clear if the hook is the hero's escape from the police, from the villains or his action to stop the plotted sabotages. In The 39 steps it was clearly scripted as 1/escaping from the police (so you know the hero can't just go to the police) then 2/running for his life and after the villains to prove his innocence.If you want a better Hitchcock from the 40s wartime propaganda I would advise you to chose Foreign Correspondant over Saboteur. They are both chase movies with a catchy finale, well really a gripping one and not just sightseeing in Foreign Correspondant as well as beautifully efficient scenes (the umbrella crowd, the tulip fields, the strange mills...).",4,14,26,1 January 2006
Gangs of New York," Who's that messing up my movie?
","Gangs of New York is not the masterpiece it might have been for all the ingredients it mixes. But the mixture is not so good. Worse, it's kind of a very impersonal movie Scorsese finally gave us.
Main FlawsOn the whole Gangs of New York lacks pace. Yet it has stamina: you never get bored as it delivers some really good scenes and something pretty interesting in between. The main plot involving DiCaprio's revenge is low-keyed by all the hysterico-historical background. True there is a crescendo involving the mid-19th century NY and its social unrest. But the focus on DiCaprio's dilemma suffers from it; it suffers all the more as Daniel Day 'The Butcher' chops most of the scenes to his will. And we don't really feel DiCaprio's inner life, that of a man who shall have no relief until his father is avenged.Perhaps Scorsese was compelled by the Weinstein siblings to edit out a lot of stuff (I heard the rough cut ran 220 min). Hence I hope there will be a masterpiece of a Director's cut opening some day in home theatres. For what I saw it's either an ill fated masterpiece or a proof Scorsese just can't direct costume epics or shoot tragedies out of his usual Italo-American background.EVERYBODY OWES, EVERYBODY PAYS - eventually there are too many owners and they all share the credit for this lukewarm mega-production.",7,0,0,17 January 2003
The Cabin in the Woods," Fine production values, loose horror/spoof/fantasy/gore proceedings
","I most probably would have avoided The Cabin in the Woods if I had known earlier the creators were screenwriters on the Lost anything-goes-I-d-sell-my-mother-for-a-twist TV-series. Yet I admit it started out good with the challenge to create something new based on that stale horror flick canvas. The gently spoofy start with a scientific background bent was promising but I realise now that the dual storyline is just a routine screen writing device to stretch a flimsy concept in order to fill up a season or the 90-min feature length.With all the back and forth between the two story lines you lose the tension and there remains only, on the surface, the curiosity about what it is all about. The climax is a Grand Carnival and it develops over the last third of the movie so either you'll feel that the main storyline is straight and efficient before switching to another movie or you will feel cheated of a real movie with substance while you get a bagful of popular horror culture, clichés and references all laid out as if it was a clever mix.",4,4,7,25 July 2016
Spectre," Routine Bond, mostly cashing in on Skyfall
","Bond #24, aka Spectre delivers the goods, the usual bravado without the inner gist. Action goes bam, innuendo goes swift and fast, romance - yes actually this time around - goes splash. The point is all of this is edited finely to maintain a good pace but it all feels disjointed in the end.The pace makes it entertaining enough, but when the end credits roll to the sound of the good old 007 theme (by Monty Norman, but Bond lovers know that John Barry actually created 90% of it) you feel that, indeed, they went for the surefire and easy kill.I guess they were so pleased with their Bond's Early Years backstory from Skyfall that they just based the whole of Spectre on it. Whereas all 23 of the previous Bond movies were 100% standalone stories, this one is pretty much a Skyfall sequel. Which is not a bad thing per se, but the result is clearly a formulaic Bond, devoid of surprises and, worst of all, of real suspense.To cap it all if, of all actioneers, you can judge a Bond flick by its villain, Spectre is a very weak entry. Since Christopher Waltz is a very fine actor I guess Sam Mendes over-intellectualised and asked him to play the villain straight. I mean we are all used to have our villain served with a little ham on the side. Javier Bardem in Skyfall was too much on the clownesque side but this time they did the opposite and gave us a Blofeld that seems to aim for a spot in the Actor's Studio Hall of Fame. Contained, clinical but emotional all the same: this would describe a great achievement in more realistic movies yet it totally feels out of place/pace/tune here.PS Frankly, having Bond just taking a lovely trip to eventually walk right into the villain's secret base, surely it's visually beautiful, but could we please have more suspense than this cold testosteroned piece of numbing bravado?",5,0,3,14 November 2015
Moon," Exciting concept, well-made low-budget but a bit naive
","The premise is great, the acting, directing and set decoration are excellent, but I personally found that Moon lacked some edge. The big flaw here is that Gerty the robot is too much benevolent and tractable to create tension. Maybe Kubrick set too high a standard with HAL-9000, then Tarkovski introduced too much intellectualized poetry before Spielberg capped it all with his heavy sentimentalism. Unfortunately Duncan Jones seems more at ease with these two than with Kubrick's inescapable noir vision.Moon feels more like these naive 'flower power' SF movies of the seventies (Logan's Run, Silent Running) than like a sharp homage to 2001. Even Saturn 3, despite its flaws, is way more edgier.In the end it's OK because it is so well done, but it could have been much better with a script polish delivering a better suspense with increasingly more actual danger for the hero.",6,2,6,23 July 2014
Her," Yet another fancy gimmick
","I was curious about Her, as much as I was curious about Being John Malkovich exactly 14 years ago. Both are gimmick movies: they start with a clever idea and try to elaborate with more or less creativity and lightness.The problem when you start with a clever idea is that you have to create the visuals to match, the inner rhythm to dispatch the concentrate subtext. In all these respects Her looks like a bland near-dystopian experience.The basic idea of having a man fall in love with an OS is clever, but it is a writer's idea. On screen images can't but leaden-limb the original idea - provided it had legs in the first place. And the best actors in the world can only act what a movie is supposed to be or is potentially about.Pretty soon it feels vain: a depressed loner, living a depressing lonely life, having an epiphany when he installs the promising AI OS? When did so-called independent film-makers decide boring was cool? It really looks like a contemporary Art Hack: 'Let's mix a lonely boring character and a lonely clever idea!' A first I thought: 'A writer as main character? Yet again?' but soon enough I was relieved to see that it was only a web-era chained-gang writer. And that was the beginning and the end of good surprises.",3,0,1,22 April 2014
The Social Network," Great scripting and acting, and then what?
","OK I'm a tad prejudiced. I had read most about the Facebook backstory over the past year and I think David Fincher is an over-rated picture mash-up maker.Let's try to be objective. There's not much to learn from the Facebook genesis. Basically it's Fight Club without fist fights. Nice elevator pitch, uh? If it wasn't for the 500-odd million people registered on The Social Network, nobody would give a damn. It Is Downright Anecdotal and Deeply Uninteresting. But the scripting is brilliant. All this uninteresting stuff just flows. There's no gap, no hang, the known reality is perfectly blended in additional fiction to leave no unknowns behind, only bright answers and nice half-answers.The acting is just perfect too. So directing must be very good, not? As a 'project manager' I can admit David Fincher is really good. Yet, since this movie will mean nothing 5 years from now - whatever becomes of Facebook - to the general public, I can just acknowledge it is a very fine marketing product. A - somewhat - good movie? Scripting and acting keep you interested all along but there's absolutely nothing in it you would feel like discussing with your friends after it reaches the 2h mark when it's time to close shop.So you may think David Fincher is a great director, I just think he has a talent for building his team, which is just half the job. Spielberg is a great director, he knows how to (and has the means to) build his dream team, he gets all the funding he wants and still, in every other movie he dishes out his trademark sentimentalism overflows. David Fincher has no trademark, he is great at nothing except feeling the breeze and setting sail at the right time. No small feat; no major achievement either.In the end only a very small number of people are able to see precisely how much of a talents' catalyst Fincher is, and how much he owes to individuals' talent and hard work. Just like with Mark Zuckerberg.",6,11,21,14 October 2010
The Birds," That's strictly very good ! (a strictly McGuffin movie)
","In 1960 Hitchcock topped himself off. That's exactly the point. He directed three masterpieces in three different genres. A visual investigation: Vertigo. A reference for every action movie (esp. 007 movies): North by Northwest. An horror tale, Psycho, where he reaches the top of what he always tried to do: enthrall audiences.Imagine you reached the top. Then can you go further and not downhill? Fortunately Hitchcock is far from using the same recipes. But what story to shoot now it's over with all that wrong man's stuff? He wants to prove he can play with our emotions once more. The fact it is difficult to show more efficiency than in Psycho is of the utmost importance. He can't. What he can do is experimenting new ways of telling a story. That's why The Birds might look arid as some experimental movies.At the summit of his art, Hitchcock knows he has nothing to account for to the critics. Some of those might have written some time 'That's strictly for the birds'. Easy to say as any critical commonplace. Now look, I'll direct no star and lay the emphasis on the technical aspect. No music but a work on sound effects (today the soundtrack is the very first by-product). For the camera work, the importance is not in the filming of the climax scenes. It's the 'resolutive' shots that follow. What I call resolutive shots is the fact you don't just get in the action and then breath. The follow up impression is much more important.'There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it.' That was Hitch's definition of suspense. Now he wants us breathless after the bang too. Psycho already did that, sure (remember Hermann's score after the stabbing violins). Just trying a visual experimentation (perhaps Hitch was kinda jealous of Hermann's contribution to the atmosphere of Psycho and he asked him just to make birds sing). You have two examples of resolutive shots in the overwhelming shot of Bodega Bay after the birds attack and when Mitch' mother comes back after she discovered the dead body of a neighbor.The McGuffin is a great one. Why are those birds attacking us gentle human beings? Hitchcock doesn't dare inventing an other story than just filming a McGuffin. He just experiments that one; something of a sadistic attitude to his audience with no packaging. Spielberg did the same thing in Jaws: why is the shark so bad? We don't care but there's a non-sadistic ending. On the contrary Hitch shoots as if he loves us and then he fools us. No happy ending.So I think this film is for Hitch fans. Strictly. Others would feel disappointed as they are not sure to understand why they've been fooled. And people usually don't want to understand as long as they feel fooled.",8,2,3,11 February 2001
Jurassic Park," I see dead species
","You know what? I recently wondered if I had actually seen Jurassic Park. I vaguely remembered I had done it some years back but couldn't be sure the couple of images in my memory arrived there while watching it or because images of JP have been so ubiquitous since.I decided to watch it and it really felt like I had never seen it... and I understand why: it is so much of a marketing product and so little of a real movie with interesting characters, elaborate plot and timing. Well I watched it anyway and it turned out that I had already seen it since I previously had given it 4 stars on IMDb.I admit I have never seen it on the big screen. Not in 1993, neither when it was reissued in 3D (I seen dead species, but not 3D... like 40% of the people). I never bought the hype because I was never interested in dinosaurs, so that makes me a blank viewer who can tell the true quality of the movie. And quite frankly it is the worst Spielberg movie I have watched (I skipped Always, and couldn't sit through Hook). Actually I don't know where it takes a talented director to shoot this. Maybe in pre-production for the artistic and ground-breaking technical choices. But that is mostly a producing job. The story itself is weak (I haven't read the book but feel it's always a bad idea to let the writer chose what to keep or not i the script) and action feels disjointed as we cut to various places that end up feeling more like the shooting sets they are than like parts of the fantastic island we are shown during the outstanding helicopter trip.Why wasn't I more impressed by the CGI + animatronics? Maybe because I didn't run to watch it back in 1993 and 10 years later this was just commonplace SFX. And again the still pictures from the movie had been so publicised that I knew exactly what to expect.So I will maintain my 4/10 rating because of the technical work in it, but it really is a poor movie. Spielberg did an excellent job with poor SFX in Jaws, here he does an excellent job at getting the right amount and quality of SFX but forgets the job he dreamt of when he had his first Super-8 camera. He even soften the evil Dr Hammond who is mostly like him: he initially has a passion for what he does and wants to do good but gets overwhelmed by the business stakes and the fact that most people around him are sycophants blurting how good he is.",4,4,13,23 July 2014
The Island," The premise is the movie, plus some Michael Bay's bouts of action
","If you know the premise (well, the movie has been advertised extensively) half of the movie is just plain boring. It takes more than one hour to explain what lies behind 'The Island'.If you don't know the premise, the first half of the movie is boring all the same. The clean polished Brave New World setting doesn't engage the audience beyond some curiosity and subsequent too-slowly-built suspense.Lincoln 6-echo and Diana 2-delta have the mind and bland behavior of a 15-year old in some Mormon drama (see Twilight). How is empathy supposed to be building for such uninteresting characters? There's the usual gigantic outbursts of Michael Bay trademark action, but the continuity is anemic.IMO the movie would have had much more dramatical/suspense potential (and would have cost much less) if the story concentrated on one/two sponsors confronted with the product they ordered. Better characters, better drama, and action unfolding from the very start. Michael Bay thought he had an actioneer with much substance this time, but he barely understands substance against action, thus The Island seems to be drifting away for 2 hours, only following the stream of its very interesting premise.",3,2,4,29 November 2010
