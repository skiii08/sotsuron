Antz," Listen up, Disney: A new standard for animation.
","I always thought Disney's animation department was a bit over-rated, with the exception of the occasional masterpiece like 'Pinnochio' and 'The Lion King.' However, when Dreamworks came along with 'Antz,' I realised just how incredible an animated film is capable of being.  'Antz' stands head and shoulders above most Disney films (especially the very similar 'A Bug's Life') because it proves that animation doesn't have to be watered-down, sugar-coated, talking-candlestick nonsense.  This film, unlike 'A Bug's Life,' for example, has not been designed to promote toys and dolls and trips to Disney World. It is a very adult film- so deep and so thoughtful that anybody who sleeps with Simba bed-sheets probably won't follow it. Bravo to Dreamworks. I'm 20 years old, not 2, and I loved this movie.",10,0,0,11 December 1998
Batman Returns," Slower and darker than the original, but Tim Burton is still the master of the comic-book-movie genre.
","There have been four Batman movies, and only the original was a great movie. The sad thing is: Batman is one of the coolest heros ever, and the movies could have all been outstanding. In Batman Returns, the villains triple up to replace the brilliant Jack Nicholson. So we get Catwoman, Penguin, and stock villain Christopher Walken taking Gotham City by storm and never really seeming all that dangerous. Batman shows up, of course, never really seeming all that impressive. Tim Burton is not great at creating action sequences, but he makes up for it with a very cool look for the sets, the costumes, and the film itself. The movie is mildly exciting at best, but it's beginning to look like a classic next to Joel Shumacker's mediocre Batman Forever and ridiculous Batman and Robin.",10,1,2,20 September 1998
54," There was bound to be a movie about New York's legendary Studio 54 sooner or later, but who knew it would be such a letdown?
","Fans of Mike Myers will not be disappointed by his funny and smart performance here. However, anybody else who sees 54 will be wondering why director Mark Christopher totally wasted talented, beautiful actresses like Salma Hayek and Neve Cambell. There is a genuinely interesting story behind the real-life Studio 54. Unfortunately, the audience will probably never know it because this movie squanders its short running time (90 minutes) detailing the boring, uneventful adventures of a fictional lead character played by Ryan Phillipe. This movie probably would have been a little more fun and would have given new director Mark Christopher slightly better reviews if Paul Thomas Anderson hadn't made the same movie, ten times better, last year, with Boogie Nights.",Null,0,0,20 September 1998
The Waterboy," Sandler returns to low-brow brilliance.
","Don't let Bulletproof or The Wedding Singer fool you. Adam Sandler is still the king of hysterical sophmoric nonsense.  The Waterboy succeeds mostly because Sandler is playing the dumbest, most violent loser of his career. And that's quite a milestone after Happy Gilmore. The sight of Bobby Boucher, his no-brain waterboy character, making tackles just gets funny and funnier as the film goes on.",Null,1,1,7 November 1998
