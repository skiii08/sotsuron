Alien 3," Not as action packed as Aliens, but a good film that is better than the original and Resurrection
","Over the years i've read mixed reviews about this 3rd installment of this popular franchise. What side am I on? Well first of all this film definately is not as good as Aliens. That film has an intensity that few other films can touch. However, Alien 3 is my 2nd favorite of the quartet and personally(Don't bash me for this)I think it's even better than the original, a film called a masterpeice by some.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!While in hypersleep, Lt. Ripley's ship crashes on a prison planet. She is rescued, but is the only survivor. She learns that she is amoung ex-criminals and has to wait for the rescue team before she can leave. Suddenly people begin dying off. Has an alien arrived with Ripley?Good story, acting, and effects. ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,2,22 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great beginning to a great saga
","Extremely underrated prequel to the classic Star Wars trilogy of the late 70's to early 80's. Although I do agree that the Jar-Jar Binx charecters gets a little old after a while, but I can overlook that.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!A jedi knight and his appentice are sent to find someone or something to help fix the problem between the republic and their enimies. They find this power in a young boy who is to become Darth Vader 30 years into the future. Exciting, great story, effects, and good acting. ****1/2 out of *****. Can't wait for Episode II!",Null,0,1,9 May 2001
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest adventure film ever made?
","Well, I guess i'm the first person here that doesn't think 'Raiders' is a classic. Don't get me wrong, I like it, but not as much as you guys do. As someone else here said, 'I couldn't sit through the whole thing.' and that's true, it's hard to sometimes because it does get slow at times. With that aside this is a good movie, not great, just good. You already know the plot. Good story, acting, and a cool theme song. *** out of *****. By the way, don't flame me for this opinion. I know most of you say it's a classic, but I don't. Thank you.",Null,0,0,19 June 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Not great, but no where near bad eighther.
","This 4th entry in the Alien franchise is weak when compared to it's strong predecessors, but isn't really a bad film. Like so many other part 4's(Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter, Hellraiser: Bloodline, Howling IV: The Original Nightmare, Leprechaun 4: In Space, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation)Alien Resurrection is mostly a rehash of the best elements of the previous installments, but like those films I mentioned it makes some of those elements still work.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILER OR 2!!!200 years have passed since the conclusion of Alien 3, and Ripley has been cloned. Why? So some scientists can take out the baby alien and use it for their experiments which includes breeding more of them. Once again Ripley bands together with a group of renegades to stop the alien race from spreading.O.k. story, good acting, and effects. *** out of *****.",Null,0,1,17 January 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Not as good as I expected, but still a great flick
","Like many others here have said, Pirates of the Carribean is one of my favorite Disney rides. When I heard that they planned on turning it into a feature film I was intrigued. I hadn't seen the first Disney attraction based movie 'The Country Bears,' which was probably a good move on my part because I've heard it's a pretty awful film, and might have made me want to steer clear of this one. After seeing the theatrical trailer when I went to see 'Holes,' I knew that I had to give it a shot. I didn't get a chance to see it in the theatres, and now that I have seen it I wish I would've found some time. Before watching the DVD I was hoping for a compelling adventure in the same vein as other great pirate flicks like 'The Goonies' and 'Muppet Treasure Island.' After watching it I...well, read on to find out what I thought.Plot: A young woman is kidnapped by a gang of pirates who just happen to be the crew of the infamous ship called the Black Pearl. A local blacksmith who was rescued by this girl years ago, asks wanted pirate Captain Jack Sparrow to help him rescue her from being sacrificed. To make matters worse, these bloodthirsty pirates are cursed and will be difficult to defeat.
The good:Top notch performances from the cast, especially the four leads. Great special effects and fight sequences. The plot is nothing new, but the script was definately written with care. A powerful musical score. Awesome costumes and set design.The bad:The film is a tad overlong and the pace drags at times as a result of it.
Not one of Disney's greatest achievements, but still solid entertainment. Fans of swashbuckling flicks shouldn't be disappointed. Bring on POTC 2!My rating: **** out of *****",Null,0,1,14 December 2003
Home Alone," Not exactly funny, but extremely well done and entertaining
","Out of all the family comedys that I have seen, I would have to say that Home Alone is my personal favorite(I would place Home Alone 2 at second place). I mean there is nothing that I can think of about this movie that I don't like. The pace is fast, the story is well written, the acting is good, and the music score really works. I couldn't ask for a more fun filled movie.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Kevin McCallister is accidentilly left alone at home while his parents go to France for Christmas. He thinks it's a good thing at first, but as soon as he learns the plans of two burglars, he must be brave if he wants to have a happy Christmas.Exciting, great story, acting, and soundtrack. ***** out of *****.",Null,0,1,23 July 2001
X-Men," What a dissapointment! But...
","...not a complete dissapointment. Like many other Sci-Fi films that have come out the last 2 to 3 years, X-Men is loaded with impressive special effects, set designs, and for once some good acting. However, like many other Sci-Fi films that have come out the last 2 to 3 years, X-Men relies more on effects than plot and charecterazation, and that(In my opinion)hurts the film both pacing wise and style wise. You guys already know the plot, so i'll just say what I liked and what I didn't like. Good stuff: Great effects, sets, good acting, and some good action sequences. Bad stuff: Mediocre plot, little to no charecterazation, a somewhat disspointing finale, and slow at times. Great effects, and good acting, but a mediocre plot, and slow at times. **1/2 out of *****. BTW, I'm not too thrilled about the sequels, but maybe they'll suprize me...maybe.",Null,0,1,27 July 2000
The Terminator," Great action flick
","I just watched this film for the first time a few days ago and I can tell you that it was pretty awesome. I was actually expecting a little better, but I wasn't too dissapointed and am ready to see the sequel again after not seeing it for so long.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!A cyborg from the future is sent to the present to kill the mother of the Earth's savior from the destruction of machines. Fortunately for her a good cyborg is sent to protect her, but that isn't enough to keep The Terminator from killing a few innocent people. Good story, effects, and great acting. ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,0,2 March 2001
Full Metal Jacket," First Half: 9/10, Second Half:5.5/10 Overall:...
","I had already seen The Shining and A Clockwork Orange, so I thought i'd give this movie a shot. Now usually I don't care for war movies, but I didn't care at the time. Did I like it as much as I wanted? Read on.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!The first half of this film has our main charecters going through their basic training. The ones who make it go on into the second half. The second half is during the Vietnam war where we again meet some of the main charecters and some new ones.Now the first half was awesome, but then there was the second half. It feels like they wrote it quickly and through in a few good scenes to make it kinda bearable. Sadly it really hurts the movie, but doesn't keep it from being good.Good story, acting, and effects. *** out of *****.",Null,0,1,27 September 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Great, but not as good as the other existing episodes
","This, the second installment in Lucas's epic series isn't quite as good as it's predecessor or sequels, but is still an overall great addition to the Star Wars legacy. I mean, could they really do that bad of a Star Wars film? I think not. !!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!! Ten years have passed since the events in 'The Phantom Menace,' and things are still not well in the Republic. As a matter of fact things are much worse. Anakin Skywalker and Obi- Wan Kenobi are asked to once again protect Padme Amidala. While Obi- Wan searches for answers, Anakin and Padme slowly grow to like each other more than they should. We learn that an army of clones is being built for what could be a major war between races in the galaxy. To makes things even worse, Anakin takes his few first steps into the darkside, so we can be sure that he will soon dawn the mask of the evil Darth Vader in Episode III.Great story, acting, effects, and music score. **** out of *****.",Null,0,1,1 July 2002
Pitch Black," Worthless peice of s***!
","The previews looked so promising, unfourtunately the movie itself sucked.First of all the plot makes no sense, the plot is not explained, and when the action gets started it's not very impressive.true the effects were good, but that doesn't make up for plot and suspence, and the worst thing about the film is how slow it is.Extremely boring, terrible story, no suspence or suprises, but good effects, and o.k. acting.* out of *****.AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!",Null,0,0,21 February 2000
The Exorcist," Excellent film
","While I wouldn't say this film is very scary(It does have it's creepy moments)I would say that it's one of best films from the 70's that i've seen and even though it's almost 30 years old, it's still intense and fun to watch in the dark with some friends along for the ride.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!A 12 year old girl in Georgetown becomes possessed by an ancient demon and makes the lives of those who live with her misrable. Her mother calls on a priest to exorcise the child, but at the cost of his and another priest's lives.Suspenseful, great story, acting, and music score. ****1/2 out of *****. Followed by the underrated Exorcist II and the overrated Exorcist III.",Null,1,2,29 May 2001
The Evil Dead," Well, I've seen much worse
","IMO this movie isn't as good as it's made out to be and it's inferior to the 2 sequels it has spawned, but it's probably the 2nd or 3rd most gory film you'll ever see in your life.!!!SOME SPOILERS!!! A group of friends spend the night in an old cabin in the forest. They find a strange book and a recording that wakes up the evil spirits that haunt the land. The spirits immediately take over most of the people and the others have to fight for survival.Great effects, good acting, and some entertaining moments, but slow at times, and a mediocre plot. **1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,2,29 August 2000
Army of Darkness," Another good sequel
","Once again we are brought into the world of Evil Dead. We have Ash, the book of the dead, and of course the titular army. The film isn't as good as Evil Dead II, but is still loads of fun.!!!POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!Picking up after the events of Evil Dead II, Ash is sent back in time to the medieval period. There he learns that he must find the book of the dead to get home. Unfortunately he wakes up the dead spirits who surround the book's location and must battle them to use the book and return to his time.Good story, acting, and effects. *** out of *****.",Null,1,1,11 April 2001
Halloween," A great beginning to the greatest slasher series in history(Minus H20.)
","While not the best slasher film in history(Or the best of the series.), HALLOWEEN holds the title for best horror film of the 70's. The plot is simple(SOME SPOILERS!), a 6 year old boy murders his sister on Halloween night and is locked up in a sanitarium. Then 15 years later on October 31, 1978 Michael Myers escapes and returns to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill his other sister, Laurie Strode. Exciting, suspenseful, great story, acting, and music score. ***** out of *****.",Null,0,0,14 May 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," If you don't wake up screaming, then you're and idiot cause this is a great movie!
","When this film came out, people were expecting another slasher film that was trying to cash in on the success of 'HALLOWEEN', but it turned out they were totally wrong. I never saw this in the theatre, but that's ok cause i still love it. I love the whole idea of teens having the same nightmares about the same 'BOOGEYMAN' and the idea of getting killed in your dreams and not waking up. The performances by Heather Langkenkamp, and of course Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger are Academy Award material. Exciting, suspenseful, great story, acting, effects, and music score. ****1/2 out of *****. Avoid the next film and move on to part 3.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
Evil Dead II," Superior to the first
","The original Evil Dead is okay. It's got great gore effects, decent acting, and some entertaining moments, but for the rest of the time it's a bit slow and uninspired with it's story telling. This sequel, however, is the opposite.!!!SOME SPOILERS!!!Ash(From part 1)takes his girlfriend to a cabin in the forest where they accidentilly wake up the evil spirits that haunt the land. The spirits take over just about everything(Including Ash's hand).Good story, acting, and humor. ***1/2 out of *****.",Null,0,1,29 August 2000
