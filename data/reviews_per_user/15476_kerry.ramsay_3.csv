Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It was just great
","This movie was just great in all of it's special effects.  I love special effects and this movie completely layed down the law.  I hope Episode II is even better.  The characters were great and I didn't even mind Jar Jar as much.  Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon tore it up and so did the queen.  Darth Maul was in a class by himself, I still believe that was the only way Darth Maul could have been defeated, he was too good to be defeated in a straight up fight.  Anyways I can't wait for the next ones to come out!!! May the force be with Gearge Lucas in finishing the others.  P.S. George I wouldn't mind being in the next one =)",10,0,1,26 May 2000
X-Men," ahh yeah
","I don't know about anyone else, but I have been disappointed with a lot of the TV series turned to movie movies that have come out.  Lost in Space didn't do it, Street Fighter just terrible, and a couple more.  They try and change the characters too much or the plot is stupid.  X-Men, was the exception.  Since Batman came out in the early 90's I haven't been impressed with a cartoon turned to movie till now.  This movie was just great.  The characters looked and sounded the parts, while the plot was good.  I can't wait to see it again.  I never got bored and it was just plain good.",9,0,0,19 July 2000
The Patriot," very exciting
","Although I did not want to see the movie originally, I have to admit that I am glad I did.  By far, it is the best movie so far this summer.  The movie never stops entertaining whether it be action or comedy.  It was just great. Mel Gibson, again, makes an incredible performance, and Heath Ledger exceeded all of my expectations.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, go and see it.  It is fantastic.",9,1,2,10 July 2000
