Requiem for a Dream," Beautifully tragic
","Most reviews will either be a 1/10 or a 10/10, those who gave it a 1 never gave it a chance, never opened there mind or saw pass the technicalities of it all. I gave it a 10 because I hate how this movie made me feel, I've never been more disgusted at life than after seeing this movie. When the credits came up, I started crying and stared at the watch next movie sign on the rental screen for a good half an hour. I couldn't bring myself to watch anything or thing of anything but this film. A movie that induces that much thought after the fact deserves a 10. Even those who don't like it because of it's disturbing theme, to admit that it was so powerful to disturb someone is to admit that it is worth the highest rating for being that powerful.I went in this movie thinking it would be like 'The Basketball Diaries' I was really wrong. It's not just another story about drug addicts, it's not trying to shove it's meaning down your throat and it's not meant to scare your children out of taking drugs as we all know doesn't work. This movie is a piece of art. The way it's shot is one of a kind, the music helps every scene to be more powerful and the acting is so down to earth you really believe the struggle they are going through. Jared Leto, playing Harry Goldfarb gives the best performance of his career and in the end you will cry for him because you sympathize so much with him. Ellen Burstyn gave an incredible performance as well and her story is the most haunting because it's her story that makes you realize this can happen to anyone and everyone.I can't honestly say I'd recommend this to anyone but I can honestly say I could, at the same time. It's a movie so powerful and haunting I could never watch again but I feel as if everyone should see this. It's a story about life and the craving you have. Whether it is sugar, TV, sex or drugs, we all have cravings and they can bring out the worst in us and this movie shows how they can go terribly wrong if we don't realize our addictions.",10,2,3,9 March 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," This year's best!
","I watched this movie some time ago when it first came out and after seeing the performances of the actors I knew they would win it all. Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto's performances are the best of their careers and should be known as the best out of most actors careers as well. Their amazing transformations of their looks and their personalities are unbelievable. Any actor who's willing to take on such a daring and taboo role deserves recognition. Jared Leto's character is a role most actors wouldn't dare act because he plays a transsexual which is still a choice that is an issue to many people so most would be afraid of the consequences. Jared brought amazing talent's into realizing this character and made their role so powerful yet at some instances his character brought the lighter enjoyable and even happy moments of the movie. Matthew McConaughey finally went out of his sappy romance movies and showcased his talents which you have not seen since 'A Time To Kill', he deserved the Oscar for best actor because he gave it his all to show such character development in his character, to give us a character whom at first we despise and in the end we love is something very difficult yet he did.Not only do I congratulate the actors for taking on roles on a subject very rarely talked about; the Aids 'plague' as some say but I thank the producers for producing this movie and having the guts to put this out there to the public. While some may say this is like 'Philadelphia' it is not, this movie while it's about the HIV epidemic of the 80's it's also about the personal journey it's victims go through and in particular how it can change a homophobic close minded character into someone who's really human.While this may not have any car chases, it brings you through ups and downs in these characters lives, their relationship with each other, their hopes and sorrows. It shows you almost a first hand experience on what it's like to live with Aids and how it effects people. It will make you see others differently, maybe even make you care about those you love more because it shows you the good and the evil people can be subjected to the same disease and disease can happen to anyone. Great meaning, acting and script. This year's best!",10,1,1,9 March 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," The century's best!
","The Shawshank Redemption in my opinion is the best movie out there. No other movie will show you such a thought provoking, well made, extraordinary acted, brilliant script than this film! A story of hope and redemption seems clichÃ© and maybe even boring but this tale will never bore you. You'll fall in love with the characters. Morgan Freeman is again at his best, and Tim Robbins gives one of his best performances next to his in Mystic River. You can watch this movie over and over again and you'll still love it and it will feel like your first time seeing it. The movie is filled with passion that it will make you cry (coming from someone who never cries), it's soulful and emotional yet still gives you action. It's a rare gem that you'll fall in love with, I definitely did!",10,0,0,9 March 2014
