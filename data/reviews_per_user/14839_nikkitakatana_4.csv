Lucky Number Slevin," Look both ways!!!
",I love this film. Absolutely love this film. And could quite easily watch it every week forever. I love the sets and the cinematography is simply gorgeous with great editing to keep the pace whisking along nicely. Great cast putting in great performances and a script I find utterly hilarious right up to the point when it needs to drop the comedy. And the soundtrack fits in perfectly.Just wish it was possible to re-watch it with a blank memory so you could attempt to piece it together all over again!!!!,10,0,0,3 October 2017
The Prestige," What to write?
","*****Warning!!! Definite Spoilers!!!*****The Pledge? Appears to start out in an interesting way.The Turn? Well there's some intrigue and a few clues as to where things may be leading.The Prestige? Unfortunately for me, this is where the film splits into 2 halves. One of which is close to brilliant, the other descends into farce. Luckily the farcical element does disappear somewhat for the film to reach a rather thrilling climax. The Borden/Fallon half is quite superb. After the 'discovery' of Tesla inventing cloning though, the Angiers half underwhelms me. I was half expecting the DVD to have a bonus feature of how Sir Isaac Newton invented the levitation of apples but my copy must be missing that chapter. Maybe I just have an issue with the retro-fitting of science fiction into a plot set in the past.It's beautifully filmed with gorgeous cinematography and the acting is mostly first class but I do wish Mr Nolan would use a steadi-cam device a bit more often. Close-ups, especially at indoor locations, where the background is waving around is something I find particularly distracting.Since on any given day I could probably rate this anywhere between a 3 and a 7 based on my personal boundaries of disbelief. (As Cutter says, 'you want to be fooled'. But I say, yeah sure but not conned). So I shall be relatively generous and stick with a 6Now I'm no writer but instead of stockpiling 99 other dead bodies for the cops to miraculously NOT find whilst investigating a murder.... What if...... the story had hinged on the Tesla machine not actually working, and Angiers engineering some foolproof plan to get Borden or Fallon backstage on a particular night when Root falls into the tank...........Well, wouldn't that have been amazing. Talking of which, what did happen to Root????I guess we're not meant to care about the guy in the box.",6,2,4,18 October 2017
Gone Girl," Worst film I've watched in years.
","This is bad. Really really bad!!! This is not so much of a review as a warning. So bad I had to watch it twice just to make sure I'd not missed a crucial element that made everything fall into place. Guess what? If I missed that crucial element first time, I missed it second time around too. Much worse than I first thought. No story spoilers here cos well..... errrm..... there's not exactly much of a story to spoil is there? All the flaws have been well and truly covered in previous comments. Unlike all the floors which should have been well and truly covered in the film. Gone Girl???? Please somebody, just make the whole bloody thing be Gone!!!",1,4,10,3 October 2017
Blade Runner," Needs way bigger than a 42' plasma.
","I think I've probably seen this film more times than any other. Original 1982 version, '92 Directors Cut and the 2007 Final Cut countless times. Literally hundreds of times all the way back to Betamax.Now, I only watch the Final Cut cos Hollywood imposed 'happy' endings are rather dull and a Directors Cut really should be the cut the Director himself says is his preferred version.I'm struggling to see how anyone can rate it a 1. Even if you don't like it the visuals alone have to be worth at least a 3 or 4. And another point has to be added for the soundtrack. Surely?Story-wise it can be as superficial as 'cop takes out bad guys' or much more thought provoking if you choose to delve deeper. Take your pick.I have nothing insightful to add here. Everything that could be said or written about this film has been said or written before. Watch it. Watch all the versions. The Final Cut is my favourite and gets a definite 10 out of 10 from me. Just make sure to watch it on the biggest screen you can.A true lover of movies has to watch it at least the once.",10,2,4,24 October 2017
