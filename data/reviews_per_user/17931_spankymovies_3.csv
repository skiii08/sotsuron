Casablanca," This is simply what movies were meant for...
","Casablanca is a richly cast and excellently performed.  The direction remains tight yet strong enough to show the deeper emotions in the story. Eve since I first got to see this movie 1 year ago I have been in love with it.  If you like movies, you will love Casablanca.  It shows just how movies can really be special things when placed in the right hands.  A wonderful movie! I hope everyone gives this movie a chance.",10,1,1,12 January 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better but still not perfect...
","Episode II was a much much better effort than the much-derided Episode I (Jar Jar anyone?) but it still lacks noticably in some areas.  The action is fast and exciting and the light sabre battles are a thrill but the romantic plotline (which dominates and drags down the first half) is cheesy, cliche, amazingly uninteresting, and proceeds to nearly kill the movie.  The second half of the movie, loaded with lasers and fights and cool-as-I-can-be lines still feels a bit hollow as a result of the lack of good character development. The franchise, although somewhat redeemed by this movie, still feels manufactured and uninspiring.",8,0,0,23 June 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Entertaining, and never too sappy-a great film!
",Lilo and Stitich is probably going to be overlooked and underrated and that's a shame.  It is one of the most refreshing Disney movies put out in recent years.  It's 'simple' non-CGI look may cause people to ignore it but the animation works beautifully and is never flashy.  The comedy is funny with some real moments of amusement and the story deals with  modern issues of family and the emotional message is wonderfully touching without being sappy (a definite plus).  This movie is lots of ways is a step out of the norm for Disney movies which isn't a bad thing.  Lilo and Stitich is a surprise gem for the summer.,10,1,1,23 June 2002
