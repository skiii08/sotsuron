The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," cheesy awkward!
","as we all know twilight saga has always been weird this time its awkward. With the whole Edward Jacob team thing i never chose one side, but breaking Dawn woouhh! Edward, I mean Jacob did better then other movies too he has a round character for the first time instead of just anger, he is cute, funny, sad as always. The good thing is the cute scenes when Edward talks. I know that sounds ridiculous, but hes done really good and he looks better then before. Bella hmm well, her acting is horrible in some beginning scenes, the way she conveys her dialogues are just just justifying at all. all other character like Alice, Jasper, Rose, Carloisle etc if it weren't for them the rest of the movie except the honeymoon scenes would be just not worth of watch. Some scenes are confusing especially at the end and not to be a spoiler but once with Jacob. ;). anyways for me the only best part the wedding its pretty funny, cute and the honeymoons funny and romantic. Lastly, Edward rocks the movie and his smile. ha ha",6,4,7,26 November 2011
21 Jump Street," all in all a expected blast!
","I wanted to see this movie so bas first of all I love Channing and I gotta love Jonah now and more love for them a partners. When the movie started I was like eh..maybe not as expected. at first I was like too much cussing yo! Finally got why it was R rated. The first 10 minutes of the movie are just hilarious like super laugh. and then the story finally starts then you get the punches of laughters and it doesn't stop until the end. Channing and Jonah did awesome and reached my expectation. The only thing I didn't like was the cuss words when not needed. The story is great. It not like a typical go with the flow or twisted movie. The plot works great, there are great supporting roles and they give good laughs. Great watch with friends, definitely not with family.",8,0,2,23 March 2012
