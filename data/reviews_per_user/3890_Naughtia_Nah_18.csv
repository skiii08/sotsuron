Men in Black 3," Men in black travel back in time
","They are keeping up the standards for sure. Men in Black 3 is every ounce as good as the two previous movies.It is nice to see Will Smith return after being off screen for about 3 years, he always does a great job. Tommy Lee Jones does not have as much screen time as I would've hoped for I must say that Josh Brolin does a fantastic impersonation of Tommy Lee Jones. I laughed so much when Josh Brolin first started speaking, he nailed the voice and facial expressions.I loved the idea of time travel and seeing aliens in the past, and Bill Hader made a hilarious portrayal of Andy Warhol.Men in Black 3 has a solid & clever plot and a lot of great special effects. I will probably purchase this one on bluray once it gets released.",8,2,5,17 June 2012
Scarface," Say hello to my little friend!
","I've always wanted to see this movie and I FINALLY pulled myself together to watch it the other day. It is so great to see Al Pacino at an younger age, he was a great actor then and he still is. This movie follows a Cuban refugee, Tony, who gets involved in criminal activities. They sell cocaine to different parts of the world and Tony's wealth is just getting bigger and bigger. Tony's enemies have an agenda to get their revenge and this can make Tony's business to go far down. My favorite part of the movie was when Tony cam out of his office with his rifle shouting 'Say hello to my little friend'.A classic scene that has been captured in many other movies as well.",7,0,2,28 August 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Glorious Tarantino has done it again!
","First of all I must say that the movie was nothing like the trailer, because the trailer promoted the movie as a splatter/comedy (Tarantino style). The trailer did not show the best values from the movie.I wasn't disappointed with the movie and I thought it was really good. Brad Pitt was fabulous as always and the other actors did a great job as well. I was especially surprised by the talented Christoph Waltz, he did such a great job playing 'The Jew Hunter', I'd like to see him in more movies.The story takes place in the Nazi-occupied France where young Jew Shosanna escapes from the claws of the Nazis. After changing her identity she plots to take great revenge for the people who killed her family.This movie was great, great, great.",8,2,4,1 September 2011
Argo," Thrilling and authentic
","While watching the Academy Award Show this year I was surprised to see that Argo won the prize for best picture. I've heard a lot of nice things about Argo prior to the award show and now I finally decided to watch it.It really amazes me how talented Ben Affleck really is as a producer/director/actor, this movie was very engaging and thrilling, and the fact that it is based on actual events makes it even more interesting. I really liked the authenticity because I really felt like I was brought back to the seventies, and at first I couldn't help giggling at the mustaches, haircuts and glasses, these reminded me of the old photos I've seen of my parents and their friends.All in all Argo is an awesome movie about conflicts between countries and about situations were people get stuck in these conflicts. Argo was great from beginning to end and I just want to give a very big thumbs up to all the people who made this movie.",9,0,2,30 March 2013
12 Angry Men," Don't rely on snap judgment
","This movie was in IMDb's top 10 list over the best voted movies of all time. I knew nothing about this movie and was very eager to watch it so that I could see what all the fuss is about.I can conclude that this movie raises so many ethical questions and the storyline is nothing less than perfect. The whole plot takes place in one single room and portrays 12 jurors with different backgrounds and points of view. One would think that this kind of movie would very easily get boring, but it doesn't at all. I was stuck to my TV screen for the entire movie.The actors are outstanding and the writers of this movie have obviously done an excellent job. This movie has probably given a lot of people something to think about, snap judgment can be so wrong.",10,1,2,29 August 2011
The Rocker," There's something about this movie that made me like it a lot
","I had a blast watching this movie, I thought it was extremely funny and very entertaining. The main character played by Rainn Wilson was the best thing about this movie. Of course I've seen this kind of stories a million times in other movies but there just was something about this movie that made me like it more than the other ones, I guess I'm feeling more sympathy for the often misunderstood characters. Other than that I think that it's always entertaining to watch an awkward person going by his/her strange existence. This is probably one of my favorite comedy movies this year, it's definitely one to watch.",8,0,1,21 June 2011
Billy Elliot," A captivating story about an unusual boy
",I was not impressed by this movie's trailer but I actually liked it quite a bit when I started watching it. The story is captivating and the acting was great.An 11 year old boy stumbles upon a ballet class and immediately gets fascinated by it. He joins the ballet class and must go through a lot of resistance from his family's who has a another set of ways. This boy must struggle to get his way and is indeed very talented. A very touching story which makes one think about the choices you make in life and how to make your own way towards the things you want to do.This movie is definitely worth to watch.,6,1,2,1 September 2011
Pirate Radio," This boat will rock you
","This movie was indeed very entertaining with a lot of great music and fabulous actors. I found myself tapping my feet to a lot of the tunes played in this movie.The movie is set in the 60s where 8 Dj's are located on a boat in the Atlantic Ocean. They play rock music and broadcast illegal tunes and themes on the so-called 'pirate radio'. The government try what they can to stop these fellas and the youth adore the Dj's. This is the age of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.I would definitely watch this movie again just to hear all the great tunes combined with these fabulous actors.",7,2,3,2 September 2011
Disturbia," Thrilling from start to end. Awesome.
",This movie was awesome! Very thrilling and catchy. Kale is a troubled teen who has lost his father and winds up with a court-order where he is under house arrest. Kale feels very trapped and tries to take different risky chances. When he starts to spy at his mysterious neighbor his suspicion grows stronger. Is this neighbor a murderer or is this just a fragment of Kale's imagination? This movie was very well done and you get action and thrills right to the end of the movie. Shia LeBeouf is one of my favorite young actors and I'm really looking forward to seeing many more movies from him. I know that this one is definitely one to watch.,9,0,1,28 August 2011
Spirited Away," A Wild Ride though the depths of Imagination
","I'm usually not that into anime/manga styled cartoons but this one blew me away. I found this title on IMDb's top 250 list, so I had to see what all the fuss was about.This movie is about a little girl Chihiro who wanders in to a mysterious world of wonders. Humans aren't welcome in this world, when discovered they get transformed into animals. Chihiro's parents have been transformed into sloppy pigs, and Chihiro is now on a mission to get her parents back and return to her home.This movie takes you on a wild ride through the depths of imagination. The thing that impressed me the most were the visual effects, the characters and wild imagination of the designers/animators. The characters are all lovable in each way and the mystery is remarkable. I did not expect to get such a good experience and I do not at all regret watching the movie. This is an must see classic.",9,1,2,15 November 2011
District 9," A science fiction movie that seemed authentic at times
","As I was expecting from a Peter Jackson production, this science fiction movie is out of the ordinary. I found it very interesting and catchy. It is nothing like the other movies I'm used to.The story is about an alien race which has come to Earth and is located in a refugee camp in South Africa. After some time tension begins to erupt between the humans and aliens, so it becomes a battle zone.The way the movie was filmed gave it a very authentic touch and I almost felt like this could have been a true story at times. I thought this movie had good action scenes and very good acting talents, the only thing I can say is that this movie was not what I was expecting to see.",7,0,4,13 November 2011
The Little Mermaid," A beautifully animated movie
","One of my favorite Disney classics of all time, I must have seen it about 100 times or more. This movie is about the sweet little mermaid Ariel who is dreaming about becoming a human so that she can be with her dream prince.This has got to be one of the best animated movies ever made by Walt Disney Studios. I know the original novel of Hans Christian Andersen and the movie does not follow the novel completely. This doesn't affect the movie and the magic in a bad way, it just makes the story more dreaming and sweet.Jodi Benson is the voice talent behind Ariel and she really does bring adventure and charm into the character. She has a very characteristic voice and sings beautifully, no doubt about that.This movie is probably cherished and loved by all the little girls around the world. It has great music, sweet characters and a fabulous storyline. Simply fantastic.",10,2,2,13 June 2011
2012," I'm no believer of the Apocalypse Predictions!
","The apocalypse is coming and it is going to hit Earth in 2012. The ancient Mayan calendar predicts this apocalypse and some researchers do what they can in order to survive this event.I remember people talking about the end of time once this movie was about to hit theaters and I find it amusing how much a movie can affect people. I'm not a believer of all the predictions of the apocalypse but I find the theories interesting.This movie was not amazing but the special effects and scenes were top notch. Great acting, great plot and fantastic visual effects. Also I loved the concept of the movie.",7,1,2,15 November 2011
Avatar," Amazing special effects, great in 3d
","I'm a sucker for beautiful special effects and epic action movies, so I found Avatar to be a brilliant movie. I watched Avatar in 3d at the cinema and I was amazed by the amount of work that has been put in to this movie. I liked the tragic story and the characters, I do not have any complaints about this movie.James Cameron has spent the last many years to develop this movie and the new 3d technology, he has succeeded well in my opinion. Avatar takes place in the far future where human kind is interfering with the natives on the planet Pandora. Because the natives want to protect their land and the humans want to interfere and take over the land, a great struggle begins.I'm definitely going to purchase this movie on BluRay in the nearest future.",10,2,7,14 November 2011
Up," Pixar has touched my deepest emotions once again
","Pixar has managed to really touch my deepest emotions once again. This movie is so beautiful and full of heart. I don't know what it is but I was actually in tears at one point, I could very easily relate to the story.I'm a really big fan of all Pixar & Disney movies, so I always have high expectations before I watch one of their movies. I loved the characters, the old man, the boy scout, the talking dog and the big bird.The only thing that put me a bit off, were the dogs in the airplanes, but what the heck, this is supposed to be a fantasy adventure. I will probably watch this movie again very soon, just because I want to.",10,0,1,25 August 2011
Zombieland," One of my favorite zombie movies
","Zombieland made me laugh so much that I almost cried. I especially loved the beginning of the movie, it is just so weird and different from all the other movies I'm used to see.Zombieland follows two guys, Columbus & Tallahassee, who have figured out a way to survive in a world swarmed with zombies. Columbus is very scared and not much of a brave person, and he has figured out that his fear can keep him alive. Tallahassee is a badass who kills a whole lot of zombies, his only wish is to get his hands on the last Twinkie on Earth.I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and I must say that this one is my favorite alongside with 'Shaun of the Dead'. This movie has a great concept and I so much enjoyed Bill Murray's part in this movie, he has the most awesome scene in the movie, it was hilarious.",8,0,2,16 November 2011
The Ringer," A lot of funny scenes
","This movie was fun to watch. Johnny Knoxville is hilarious and there were a lot of funny scenes. I don't know what it is about Johnny, but he can look pretty (sorry for the use of words) retarded at times.This is a story about a man who sinks very low in his life and finds himself in economical difficulties. To get out of these difficulties he plans to rig the special Olympics by entering the competition himself. He then discovers that he needs more training in order to beat his competitors.I usually don't think very highly of Knoxville movies but this one was indeed very watchable.",6,0,0,28 August 2011
50_50," Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a diamond in the rough
","This movie really surprised me, I did not expect much because I did not see any trailer or ads for this movie before I started watching it but I got a really great experience. Surprisingly Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Seth Rogen had a really good chemistry going on, and the movie crosses a really tragic subject together with some great humor, so it got a bit emotional at times.I'm set to believe that Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been a 'diamond in the rough' and he has really begun to shine as an actor these last few years. He's come a long way since '3rd Rock from the Sun'. I'm also grown real fond of Seth Rogen, he's really different and charming in a way.This movie is definitely one to watch if you're in need to get some cheering up on a rainy day.",9,0,0,25 April 2012
