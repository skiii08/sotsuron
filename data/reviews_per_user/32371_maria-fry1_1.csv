Skyfall," Disappointing
","*****CONTAINS SPOILERS***** I was really disappointed with this film - I had heard so many good things from friends who had been to see it, so I was expecting a lot more. I found the plot to be really thin and dull. It didn't feel much like a bond movie to me.I also thought it was really predictable (saw the 'getting caught on purpose' thing coming, and was waiting for M to die through the entire film.Bad Points * What was the point in Shanghai? Other than to enter a room in a skyscraper that seemed to be full of glass doors and nothing else.* It was awfully convenient for the casino chip to be in the assassins gun case. Because that's where you usually store a casino chip.* I thought it a bit presumptuous of Bond to waltz straight into the shower of the casino woman, particularly after the discussion of how scared she was of Silva and how she had been sex trafficked.* It was a little bit convenient that this amazing hacker guy didn't know MI6 were on their way.* Did no one else know he was captured on purpose? Saw that one coming.* Also saw the 'lets break into his laptop' plan going wrong. The minute they started decrypting I was waiting for someone to say, 'stop, this is a trick!' * Considering how Silva had ranted about how much he hated M, it took a long time to find the answer to the question 'Where is he going'.*What was the point of Silva getting caught. Yes, he wanted to see M again, but if he was really the '007 before 007', surely he could have managed to track her down (given his hacking ability) and get rid of her? * It's not very realistic that Bond, M and some old guy would have taken out about 25 of Silva's men.* If you are running away from death in the cover of night, would you really use a torch? * The woman playing Moneypenny was really irritating.All in all, the beginning sequence was amazing and the end sequence (apart from the gripes above) was also pretty good. The middle was where the movie fell down.",5,10,22,2 November 2012
