Child 44," To long and drawn out!
",Absolutely no reason this movie needed to go on for over 2hr 17m! Fantastic cast with huge potential. Btw Paddy Constantine should never attempt another accent ever again especially Russian/Yorkshire.. becomes pretty predictable in the end with to many worthless scenes I myself was willing it to end. Poorly edited means by the end I was to bored to care.,4,1,1,20 November 2018
Hereditary," I wanted my Mammy.
",This one is a real horror. When you are sat in fear and dreading happening what you think is going to happen but what happens is even worse. Very tense my anxiety was on through the roof. One complaint is the son was a fully grown man cast as a 15 year old.,9,2,6,24 February 2019
Snowden," Big balls
",Decent movie new very little about this story and it seems to me the guy did the right thing! Living a dream life in Hawaii with lots of money and chose to blow the whistle. Good on him I say can't say I would of had the balls.,7,0,0,30 January 2019
Life," Bad decisions!
",I initially give this movie a low mark. I have just re watched it and it's not all bad. Some silly stuff goes down and some god awful decisions made by some supposedly super intelligent people? I see people complaining about such tings on here but if they didn't were would the movie go? Over all it's worth a watch if your not a hugely critical type. Just let it go and enjoy.,7,0,2,24 February 2019
