The Blair Witch Project," This 'Project' gets a passable grade
","It certainly became one of the most hyped and discussed movies of 99, and, along with The Sixth Sense, proved that horror movies could find a modern audience outside the Scream genre. But, unlike The Sixth Sense, The Blair Witch Project doesn't hit the artistic mark.To the films credit, it does create an occasionally unnerving atmosphere that most horror films fail at. The low budget adds a lot to the proceedings. Plus the ending is effective, and gives you something to talk about with your friends afterwards.But the movie was more self-promotion than content. Blair Witch, and it's success, was more a product of the Internet than of artistic quality. This is not an insult to the co-directors, who do show a lot of talent and promise. But this film was already established to be a hit before it was even released.Some critics and hangers-on were claiming The Blair Witch Project was the most frightening film since the brilliant The Exorcist. No matter what merits the film has, Blair Witch is no classic. The lack of character development and logic (those three students seem pretty stupid...) keep this one from being as good as the hype websites would suggest...",Null,0,1,27 April 2000
Scary Movie 2," Dreary Movie
","This is a prime example of how not to make sequels. The original Scary Movie was not a great movie (or even a good one), but it did at least have guts and was able to supply audiences with a decent amount of laughs.Alas, Scary Movie 2 is a hack effort from K.I. Wayans, who showed a lot of true comic talent years ago with I'm Gonna Kit You Sucka and TV's In Living Color. This is the thinest possible material for a major sequel (oh, I forgot Speed 2), with gags not even measuring up to those of Leslie Nielsen flicks like Wrongly Accused or Spy Hard. There are a lot jokes thrown at the audience, yet only the occasional one actually gets a laugh...the James Woods/'Exorcist' spoof mildly manages to succeed. It's all downhill from there.Marlon Brando had to decline the movie for health reasons. Or maybe he just reread the script.",Null,0,0,1 March 2002
The Thing," Some 'Thing' wonderful
","Although a box office dud at the time (thank you very much, E.T.!), this flick become a critical and cult favorite. The reputation is deserved, as it features John Carpenter's most tight and taut direction ever.
The characters are pretty much unlikeable throughout, but the impressive cast (including Russell and future Emmy-winners Richard Dysart and David Clennon) make them uncomfortably human. We may not like them, but we don't want to see them butchered by this alien life form.Of course, Rob Bottin's creature FX is the movie's real drawcard, and even in the 2002, they're still nothing short of astounding. I can honestly say that the thing is still the most creative and fascinating movie monster ever to grace a horror film. The entire sequence involving the transformation of Charles Hallahan into the thing is one of the amazing, and surreal, pieces of cinema ever. The fact that Bottin didn't win an Oscar, or even get a nomination, is totally beyond me, and a slap in the face of the makeup FX master.It ain't a feel good movie, but The Thing is a classic of the genre (better than Alien) and a must see...for those who can handle it.",9,0,1,30 July 2002
