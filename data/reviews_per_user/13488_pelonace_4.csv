The Avengers," A perfect example of a great collaboration.
","Movies aren't made like this, we rarely see something of this magnitude being put in theaters. It's been over 5 years in the making and The Avengers surely lives up to the hype.I remember browsing a movie website back in 2007 showing movie info for a movie called 'The Avengers' i didn't think to much of it because it said hero's such as Ant Man, Captain America etc. would be in it but i never gave to much thought about it. But when Iron Man came out i was impressed, then The Incredible Hulk came out i was officially hooked on Marvel knowing what The Avengers could and would be. Thor and Captain American came out and the anticipation that has been kept at bay was time to come. The Avengers is here.Non stop action with a cast that are comfortable with their roles, just seeing them all on screen was something we all yearned for after all these years, and we finally get it. Its everything you expect from a great superhero movie, all uniting for the same thing, teamwork and bravery, something we all love to see and done in such a unique way. The blend of all these characters couldn't be done any better, if you've been waiting for that perfect Marvel movie, its here.",10,1,4,4 May 2012
Midnight in Paris," Paris Rain
","Who wouldn't want to relive the glory days of Paris? Though at what cost? Is it because we are unsatisifed with our own current lives that we must seek some sort of escape to go back in time to a time when things were 'better'.Owne Wilsion goes to Paris with his Fiancé for a vacation with there her parents but when they are there Wilsion is just over excited with all the history and beauties that Paris has to offer. He gets so wrapped into it that one night hes walking the desolate streets of late Paris. He meets some of the most influential, magnificent writers and painters of the roaring 20s. Its something he could only dream of actually come true, but when he keeps visiting the past he starts to question if he really is happy to be in the past or just the fact he gets to escape from his mundane life that he is unsatisfied with. He starts to loose touch with his Fiancé who is played by Rachel McAdams who doesn't really understand the obsession that Wilsion has with Paris and doesn't really want to understand. Wilsion just shrugs it off because its his Fiancé what can really do, its only when he goes through some sort of transition when going back in time to the golden age of Paris. I never really watch movies like this, but it really touched my inner cavalcade of appreciation of what we use to have and what we have now. Yes we can go back and live in our favorite era, but it will never do us no good, because the life we live now will be our real era and we can't do anything about, good or bad.",8,0,0,28 March 2012
Drive," Oh My Love
","I'm not going to lie, before I saw this movie I thought Ryan Gosling was just another chick flick heart throb but damn my perception of him is blown.A movie so embedded with the style of classic film-noir and stylish new genre of art-house action. something that's rare in movies, though the plot is so plain, its what makes the movie fantastic, its not complex its not twist filled. May come off a little slow, but it catches you off guard, and that's what makes film great.Poetic yet violent, malnourished yet gruesome. Its a tribute to all those 80s action films with that retro feeling and cool vibe, a tale of a forbidden love and mafia heist. A protagonist which everyone can relate to, a man driven by nothing, a loner on a road with nothing and no one on it, though when something special comes along, his whole world changes.",9,27,43,19 February 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Our Dark Knight is at peace.
","2004 We got a taste of Nolan's vision of the caped crusader and left us in awe. Four years later we witnessed a superhero movie exceeding in every level in both action and drama, honestly I can say a perfect movie. The wait is over and its time for our Dark Knight to rise once and for all. 8 Years have passed and Gotham is for the first time in a long time doing good, crime and corruption don't pave its streets anymore, Harvey Dent has been the true symbol of a hero forcing The Batman to hide. But evil never stops, the mercenary Bane has his sights set on Gotham to destroy the great city with fear and destruction. Before watching this movie don't expect 'The Dark Knight' standards, if you do you will be disappointed. I think this movie was amazing though its flaws there were many, I still cannot deny it's a fantastic film. The pacing is very fast even for a 2 hour and 45 minute movie but not in a way where you want it to end, but because you constantly want more. The focusing more on Bruce Wayne was done well i didn't mind seeing more of him than of Batman. Bane was so terrifying and scary because unlike previous Batman films, he could actually kill Batman, though some scenes his voice was inaudible, didn't change the fact of how intimidating he was. Gordan you can't feel nothing but sympathy for the guy, having to hold that secret with him for 8 years trying to relive the glory days of Gotham City. Blake was okay he didn't really have any relevance for being there just for the big set up for the end, but other than that he was no one memorable. The two characters that gave it there all were Catwoman and Alfred. Yeah we all scratched our heads when we heard Anne Hathaway would be playing Selina Kyle but by god did she deliver in so many ways, sexy and seductive yet deadly and conniving. Seeing her and The Batman together on screen just made me happy. Emotions had to be brought to this movie and Alfred didn't fail to make you feel unsettled his constant worry with Bruce and just not wanting to help anymore, he loves Bruce but he can't see him keep doing this. In the end this movie is no where near as good as The Dark Knight but gives The Batman a extraordinary trilogy, Music that will give you goosebumps, unforgettable characters, a story so intense and heart beating not letting you rest. Ethos and pathos playing so much in this film, which is what a great movie does, makes you feel and care. Congratulations Nolan we thank you for a fantastic trilogy you can now rest just like our Dark Knight.9.4/10",10,1,4,21 July 2012
