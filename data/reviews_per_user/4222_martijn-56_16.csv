National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Very entertaining
","Come on people! All those negative feedback I truly do not understand. If you want to see Last Tango in Paris, or the Deerhunter, this is not the movie to see. This is innocent entertainment and what is wrong with that? Do we really want the horror of Aliens & Predators, or the carnivore creatures in I am Legend around this time of year? I do not! This is a nice, well told, Walt Disney story about treasures and secrets. This movie lives up to it's promise in that respect. People who expect it also to have a major character development want too much. Just like Da Vinci code stories, they are plot driven, not character driven Fellini movies. Just sit back, relax, and go for the experience. I wanted to see a movie that took me to London, Paris, the White House and 'Who Killed JFK' and here it is. I think the characters were fun, just as they should be in the story. At least it has a lot of irony in it, which makes it even more fun. I hope they will make a third. Nicholas Cage is getting old? What does that mean? We all do! I think he is good, still is. Well done guys, at least some positive and decent stuff out here around Christmas!",9,2,4,26 December 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Instant classic!
","I have seen many movies, from Audrey Hepburn to this one, and I thought I would not like the violence in Tarantino movies, but as Bill himself said in an interview, these movies are not about violence, but about the inner workings of violent people. After seeing part 1 I became an instant fan, but I was a bit afraid that no one could really live up to really making that Bill character alive enough. I was wrong - it could not have been done better than by David. Apart from him, of course all the others were good too - Ulma and the 'Hateful bitch'. Excellent music, excellent - almost absurd- discussions between the Bride and her opponents before they start the fight. Very successful mix between Spaghetti western genre and 70/80s Karate movies. And David Carradyne, if I spell it right, as Bill is unforgettable. Rollingstone once said, in the CD booklet of 40 licks, the Best of the Stones, that Keith Richards was the undisputed King of Cool - but no more, since the days of Bill! What an excellent voice, unforgettable lines, and of course last but not least acting - this guy should have got at least an Oscar nomination for it. To me he is the undisputed King of Cool now, even if I have to admit it sounds like I am 15 now, but still he is! Hope to see him in many more movies to come!",10,2,4,2 July 2005
Alien: Resurrection," Very artistic and almost brilliant gore...Far too underrated!
","As one reviewer put it: Alien was about suspense, Aliens was an action movie, the third was a tragedy and this final one is gore. But just like Alien 3, for which Sigourney Weaver should have won the Oscar, also this fourth installment is underrated â€“ even by James Cameron, who ranked Alien Vs. Predator as the number three in the franchise. I think the same happened to the Matrix sequels; the second and third were incredible movies with lots of new stuff, but nobody particularly liked them. Why? The Matrix, as Alien, and Aliens were just some of the best movies ever made and probably Aliens is, with The Godfather 2, the only sequel I know that is equally good as the first (or better). The reason that sequels are still made is therefore commercial, not a director's ambition to leave his artistic mark. Still, Aliens, the first sequel in the series became a classic, why? The success of Aliens was due to the fact that James Cameron realized that for now only an action movie would do, making a totally different genre of his sequel. So how about Resurrection? If you ask me, I think this is a good sequel since it flowed naturally from the first three movies: we have the Ripley character and a bunch of people being hunted by the Aliens trying to make their way out into space. That part is familiar (= what we go to see an Alien movie for); the rest is new to make it a movie strong enough to stand on its own (that is why we still go to see a sequel). Resurrection had a comic book style script with humor, and beautiful decadent sets, almost futuristic Art Deco. Ripley herself was the perfect mix: she had something familiar, and lots of new stuff, since she was Ripley and yet, being cloned 200 years later with an Alien inside her, she wasn't Ripley anymore. Ripley being different was probably the thing many fans had problems with, but had she stayed the same helpful brave woman, the same fans would have complained it was all too repetitive. I think the fact she was and wasn't the same helped me to adjust to a new formula, which after three movies was inevitable. I thought this new Ripley and Alien-queen-in-one was a great find (albeit with disgusting consequences, making a smart anti clone statement at the same time); she was almost like a predator herself, with a humoristic and unpredictable tweak, still keeping her strong character alive that made her an extremely credible protagonist in the first three movies. Still, this movie got less than a 7 score. For me this is the paradox of sequels: when we get the new stuff we have not seen before we think the movie deviates too much from the original, and yet, too many familiar things make any sequel too repetitive. But to be fair: I have never seen a more disgusting movie, and I had problems with that. That is the reason I could never give it a 10 like the first two. But visually it was a pleasure to watch, making this director just as much an artist as Cameron or Scott were. Let's just say Alien and Aliens were classics and I am happy we got Alien 3 & 4, since I enjoyed them more than I was disappointed that they were not as good as the first two (impossible anyway). Resurrection had lots of new stuff, beautiful sets, and effects, and the acting acting, especially of Sigourney, was great: definitely 9 out of 10!",9,6,10,28 October 2011
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen does it again!
","Fantastic movie, just as enjoyable as The Purple Rose of Cairo, or any other better movie from him and they always have the following ingredients: they are hilarious, serious, meaningful, intellectual, neurotic, they have great story writing - and they are about two problematic realities of life: relationships and the arrow of time. I watched Midnight In Paris and what can I say? The next day it still makes me happy, typing this, with the soundtrack on the background (Cole Porter, You do something to me). This movie is utterly great entertainment! Woody Allen does it again! This movie has intellectual snobs, materialistic women, right-wing politicians, dreamy writers, time-space mix-ups, all set in Paris. This is a wonderful trip in cultural history about this greatest city of the world, furthermore there is great jazz music (buy the soundtrack!), and, the acting is great. So what more could one want watching this movie? One, to see Paris immediately, second: a guarantee from above that Woody Allen will live to a 100 to make many more movies like this. Thank you again Woody Allen for another knock-out flick with substance! And of course, Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams for being such great protagonists!",9,0,0,1 March 2012
The Adventures of Tintin," Closes the gap between movie and 'you might as well be there'
","For those who read Infinite Jest, the future seems (as Einstein also said) coming to us sooner than we think: with this installment the gap between real and animation has yet again been made smaller. But this movie is not only great in CGI. After all, the core will always remain the story, and atmosphere and this has also been handled with the greatest care. I was familiar with this best story of Tin Tin since the 70s and I never thought I would see it come alive so much as in this masterpiece. It is indeed a cross between Indiana Jones and the cartoon atmosphere of the Herge original; a nice treasure hunt in a romantic setting (detective film noir like city scenes, desert scenes in Marocco, airplaines, pirates, chasing scenes, humor, emotion, it is all there). It watched it in 3D and I must say this is the future too - it all comes so much more to life in comparison to 2D. This is simply a must to see 3D in theatres - go while you can!",10,0,2,12 November 2011
Alien," Perfection
","Maybe a 10 is given a bit too much for recently released movies, but this of course is from 1979. For a science fiction horror this is surely a big feat. I give it a 10 since I cannot discover any flaw in it and I also realize to sum up all the good things in it would almost make this and endless story. Even Ridley Scott himself admitted in his 2003 director's cut he changed little since he thought the movie was 'pretty good'. He had always been rather proud of it, he said. Rightly so. What are the elements of a great movie? Story, actors, cinematography (including spec fx), music. They were all perfect. The cast of course, well, no comment necessary. Excellent acting, and also the way they interacted with each other. Ripley really had the chance in this script to show her leading abilities (with irritation of crew members towards her, jealousy?), and earn her credits for being the only survivor of the Nostromo. Also her slowly built up distrust of the scientist is done well. Actually you have to see the movie again, to focus on his behavior's, then you see he is anticipating everything that happens, without much emotion. Story is excellent and simple. It also leaves a lot unanswered, like why the UFO landed there, but with still keeping it credible. Did the UFO find the Aliens on that planet, or did it carry the eggs all the way and crashed there? Well we do not know, since they could also not know it. Excellent foreshadowing when they walk up to the lonely fossilized alien looking at the stars: 'bones are bent outward, like he exploded from the inside. I wonder what happened to the other crew members....' Well, soon we know. The good thing is, you are so involved in the movie and effects, that at least I did not register all this stuff and was surprised as what happened to John Hurt later. Effects are amazing, even today. The view to the stars from the window of the ship while Ripley and the scientist wait for the rest of the crew to come back from the planet, for instance. Beautiful. Or the Nostromo, shot from below. Copied in Independency Day! Ridley Scott really made the setting do something in the story, which is how it should be (as also told in 'How to write a great novel' books by the way). The claustrophobic tunnels, the Art Deco copper designs, the chains, the water dripping, the beautiful alien ship, the smoke all around to hinder visibility (maybe the monster is there!), the sounds of the ship (esp. when it is turned on to automatically explode), the hyper sleep bed,they were all copied in the sequels, for a reason. Last but not least, the alien design. Just how great can it be? A black dragon without real eyes (nor emotion), and a mouth in a mouth. Just brilliant. Not possible to top. It also helps to believe the scientist's admiration for it's purity. After all, it is in it's ugliness also beautiful. Then, the music, great too! Mystical, sometimes creepy, totally fitting and making the atmosphere. For instance the flute sounds when they land on the prime ordeal planet. It all works in this movie.Incedible! And then just how it is shot. So many scenes that are memorable, too many to mention. For instance the slowly standing up of the monster from behind really makes the enormity convincing. Or Ripley in the end alone in the shuttle, with the almost stoned look on her face when she discovers the Alien is still there. That is excellent pulling back, I would say. In stead of being hysterical, she is almost serene, like really living a nightmare. If you can, watch it once with the director comment on, then you see it all, every artistic choice that was made, and had the right effect.It would not be complete without my idea on Aliens of course. I think, for other reasons, it is right that it also got an 8.5 as this one. Maybe the most important reason for this is, that after a 10 out of 10 movie like Alien, Aliens still was for other reasons equally good. Probably with the Godfather, this is the only one. Aliens was not shot as beautifully as this one, but it has the amazing spectacular special effects, and lots of stuff we had not seen before with of course, the alien queen in it and the girl, that, unlike in most movies, was not annoying but really added to the horror of it. And it had the moving and super spectacular scene in the (almost) end, where Ripley and the girl are on top of the world in fire, with no ship to pick them up, and she tells her to close her eyes. And it had even more slowly built up tension, which is an extraordinary feat, since normally with sequels this does not work (like in Halloween) since we have seen it all in previous movies. But Alien is my favorite, although I would give Aliens a 9.9 or so.",10,0,1,5 November 2008
The Thing," One of a kind
","The Thing is not only the undisputed best sci-fi horror movie of all time, even topping Alien and Aliens, but probably one of the best movies ever made regardless the genre. Different genres make different movies and generate different emotions, of course, but this movie totally succeeds in evoking a lot of feelings, and doing everything right. It is truly a work of art â€“ and I am not even talking about effects alone; they are still top notch today, simply incredible for 1982. The Casting is great; all characters are played well and they are all individuals, both fitting the profile of the person you would expect to work in remote areas, as well as making it convincing anyone could later be one of those Things also. Because the people in the movie are all so different, and yet all so human and convincing, it is as if you see the story unfold through your own eyes. This distance of observer to the subject is what great art can keep at bay, and this movie excels in it. All through the end the film stays utterly unpredictable, since almost never we get to know more than the guys in the movie. Therefore, again, it feels like we are there ourselves, cleverly creating a bond between us and the humans in the movie. We never know who is who, who will make it and who won't. But we all hope 'we' make it in the end. Just as in the people struggling for survival in the Invasion of the Bodysnatchers, we feel the sense of loss as the movie progresses and mankind is slowly but surely taken over; the powers and knowledge of the Alien power might be infinitely bigger than ours and its superiority is maybe meant to survive us, but what it lacks is of course emotion, feelings, all that makes humans to special and worth fighting for. The Thing also excels in storytelling. Take the beginning. Action and setting plus players straight away, the landscape of the Arctic, the eerie pulsating beat of the GREAT soundtrack (also 10/10, you just feel the gloomy future on mankind if the Thing gets into civilized areas), a helicopter chasing a dog, the crew just as us looking at it, thinking: what the Sam Hill? Just as them, we will soon find out. Great art, whether it is a story, a painting or a movie, plays cleverly with our unconscious desires, fears and fantasies. What is shown and not told, is in the Thing just as powerful as what is not shown, but only told, leaving it up to us to fantasize. Instead of showing the inside of the UFO, or how the alien looked like in the ice, we see a distant black and white video of the doomed crew in the snow, as if it was an old Arctic exploration team a hundred years ago. It would be tantalizing to see the UFO from the inside, and the Alien too, but to not do it is the perfect choice of the director, leaving it to our own fantasies to work it out, thus creating suspense. We know the alien is old, came from far away, imitated life on a million planets, is smart, powerful and now it wants us. Even the computer prognosis of 'doc' is creepy: if it reaches civilized areas, entire world copied in around three years. But do we really believe in 'this voodoo nonsense'? (Even the dialogues in the movie are 10 out of 10). We do when we see the character Bennings burnt down, howling, with hands half finished, half human, half the unimaginable monster that is underneath, we know the Thing might indeed truly be amongst us. Of course, in reality it probably taps the subject of humans themselves: we are all capable of love, but also of burning Jews in gas chambers. We have wonderful visions, we can be brave, but we also have nightmares and fears. Not all that is human we are proud of. Together with the big picture, also used in the Bodysnatchers, it is all about society getting violent and less human, no government after Nixon can be trusted, et cetera, further tapping in on paranoia. The Thing is maybe not so different from us, maybe it is already here, after allÂ… What this movie DOES show,wow, how magnificent can special effects be? And how unpredictable? The shape shifting of one of them turning into a werewolf cum spider is unforgettable and still terrifying today when I see it. It was lucky CGI wasn't available then, making it all look more organic and realistic than any computer could have made it.The setting of the story, and the movie, is also great: a closed environment, violent weather outside, a violent unseen creature inside: suspense guaranteed. But to keep it from sagging, the story even succeeds changing in the end, when the Thing realizes it has no way out of there, and wants to freeze again, waiting for a possible rescue team to pick it up. It is then not anymore about who is who, but a race against the elements: who will be the last to die? If it is the Thing, mankind will be doomed in the future. In a grand finale we see the whole combined shapes into one monster creature, an idea taken over by James Cameron in the end of Terminator. So when the last remaining character suddenly appears and asks Kurt Russell 'did you kill it?', we know he did, or did he? Perfect dialogue again, indirect, since Kurt Russell replies: where were you? Well, he got lost in the storm and so it is the end, creepy and eerie to the last second: 'how do we make it?' 'Maybe we shouldn't?' Not only a 10 out of 10, but one in a million!",10,0,1,18 March 2011
Bridge of Spies," 'It is a bloody good story' (quoted by Spielberg), but alas not told from the much more urgent present times
","I gave this movie an 8 for how it showed simply a good cold war thriller. It had the cold war tension between the US and USSR, played out in the divided Berlin, both East and West. Beautifully filmed as a British costume drama, I also liked how Tom Hanks's character provided some inner tension in how his look on justice for all, even for spies, had consequences for both himself as his family. What is surprising though is that Spielberg confirmed in a BBC interview he had no political message in this one. That is curious to say the least, with all the abundant contemporary parallels like Snowden for Abel in the story, or drones for the U2 back then. His reply was 'it is just a bloody good story'. Sure, but a story that makes America look good, in 2015, a time when he could have made a political thriller that could have given us a much more balanced view of reality we see today, with the US spying on everyone. The result would then have been much more powerful and less preachy. His choice is all the more peculiar, since he did not shy away showing us uncompromising battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, but perhaps it was also helping us realize that was indeed a deserved accolade for what America has done for the world. Spielberg is, as IMDb says, indeed one of the most influential figures of cinema, and he deserves this for his many film making qualities as also this movie shows us again. I just wish with aging he would also have the guts to be like Shakespeare, to allow the arguable greatness of the US to shine through all the flaws it surely has like any country. But, to stick with Spielberg, if you just go for the story alone, and you don't mind the propaganda of the US being the ultimate example of the Good of the Free World, then this beautifully adapted film is entertaining enough.",8,0,0,30 January 2016
Knowing," Not totally original, but good entertainment
","First of all: yes, I would recommend to watch this movie, since the plot and action is gripping enough to watch it from beginning to end. Nicolas Cage is solid, and so are the other actors, especially the little boy and girl. The graphics are not bad, although in 2009 they could have been a lot better. But they were not the most important in the movie, and the plot makes up for a lot. So there is hope after the horrible remake of The Day The Earth Stood Still.Of course I won't dwell on the plot here, since we can all find that on wikipedia. I did read if before watching, and regretted it. It is better not to know, even in this Knowing movie!Main theme is that the End of the World is coming, and some 'angels' will come to earth to save some kids to start all over again. For anyone who knows quantum mechanics, or Heisenberg, this is where the credibility of the movie ends. Determinism does not exist, and even if things could only happen in one way, there is no way any 'identity', or God, could know this. Since of course then, that God would have to include his own influence on the environment he tries to predict. And how could Aliens know what the sun will do in 2009? What is for sure, everything in the universe is connected, and therefore nothing can be known for sure. It is like trying to get a truthful wildlife picture standing in the middle of a wild park in South Africa: of course we would get a lot of lions and zebra's there, but they would have been behaving different if our smell did not disturb them. This disturbance, the uncertainty principle, underlies the fallacy of this movie. Even more: uncertainty, or chance, means we have a choice, and out of that choice comes purpose and meaning. If all was fixed, THAT would be meaningless. So the whole point of the time capsule and events that helped Nicolas Cage to get his son saved were not necessary: if determinism existed, it would happen anyway. The Aliens could just have picked up his son, no matter what Cage tried to get at the right location in time. But it gave a gripping plot. So enough about determinism vs. uncertainty now. Movies are to escape, and I could let go my disbelief. Lovers of the genre will see this one is a blend of movies we have seen before; scenes from the Day the Earth Stood Still, as well as fire blast scenes from Independence Day, and apocalyptic atmosphere as seen in all of these, especially Deep Impact. And, to end the criticism, since I liked the movie anyway: why always a character that is put in disbelief, since of course the death of his wife impairs his judgement? It would be enough to have a totally happy man stumble on incredible data. That would also raise eyebrows all the same among his friends. We have seen that 'troubled and not taken seriously' type of main character too much now.What was new in this one, is that the world only knew in the last moment, so there was not as much emphasis on the people left behind as was in Deep Impact. New was also the bittersweet end, that was a happy one for only a very few.So all in all, a solid good action sci-fi, but not one with horrifying resonance as the Bodysnatchers had, or Aliens. Those movies won't be forgotten, this one will in time. So what can we expect for When Worlds Collide to stand the test of time? It would have to add something we have not seen before. Probably more focus on what it means to live the end of the world, and dazzling graphics for 2 hours non stop. Not only for 2 minutes, as in most movies of this genre. ID-4 was the big exception, and that's probably why it grossed so much. Something to think about for the producers!",8,5,10,3 April 2009
Ender's Game," Enjoyable
","Good acting, good special effects (albeit stolen from Independence Day and Starship Troopers) and in all, a science fiction movie I have not seen before. There are interesting themes, on the ethics of preparing kids for battle, and on whether a beautiful victory in war exists at all. What I did not like was the theme we got straight away: once you know or understand your enemy, you love him. That came back in the movie many times, when Ender had to fight his way to the top. But he was fighting humans, not bugs. And even then, yeah right, to take a clichÃ© example, I don't think people in concentration camps would concur on loving the Nazis by understanding they did all that horrible stuff because they loved Goethe and Beethoven and just wanted to force their German culture on the world (as Thomas Mann 'explained' the reason for World War 2). There are always plenty of reasons and explanations to understand some wrong philosophy some population uses as a justification for taking over the world, but it never makes it right. Same for these bugs, they were overpopulated on their own planet, like us, and invaded our earth like we mistreat our own planet, but because they are essentially like us, we would understand and love each other? That is the same crap as Matrix 2, saying the synthesis between man and machine was not so bad after all. The reality is, if something like this would happen, you could never be sure if the bugs would not try again after a century or so (the Germans did after World War 1, to finish my clichÃ©). Nevertheless, in the end Ender felt sorry for these poor bugs and, for some reason, was allowed by his superiors (o no, it was conveniently added in the last seconds he became admiral and could do whatever he wanted) to find a new home for the last alive queen to breed. So at least we can expect a sequel, when that queen decides to take over our planet once again after some years. And, by the way, how did those ants build spaceships?",7,2,6,17 November 2013
Call Me by Your Name," Brideshead Revisited but without the bitterness
","I always try to put myself in the shoes of actors and directors as: if I would have a script like this movie, how would I make it come to life on the screen?
Atmosphere is one of those things that arises when a movie does everything right, but it is hard to put your finger on which parts actually were done so well since they all work seamlessly together as in an organism. In this movie, of course the surroundings are lush, most of the people are good lucking and well educated and cultured, so no wonder you have atmosphere, but it would not be enough to make this movie as good as it has turned out to be.The music is an excellent mix between classical music, dreamy contemporary melodies and pure 1980s tracks that were popular in France, Italy and other European countries back in the days.Of course the acting and the chemistry between the protagonists made it all come true. I loved the subtle play that built up tension, attraction and affection between these two young men. And the verbal punch of the father in the end, who I wrongly thought was just a professor not paying attention to his surroundings, that made this the movie of the year for me - while a week ago I would have given that to The Hero. 
Listen to the father's speech and you re-wind the movie for yourself, and see it make sense. I have only seen this done in one other movie that was almost perfect and that was As Good As It Gets when Jack Nicholson summed up what Helen Hunt meant to him. Wonderful to see how living through grief can also mean realizing the joy you have had, and still have in a memory for the rest of your life.
This movie will stay with you for days which means forever, since something will have have changed in you.
TimothÃ©e Chalamet will be big, hopefully!

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Best Hollywood production of the decade
","I think this is the best Hollywood production I have seen since King Kong in 2005 and a brave and succeeded attempt to combine visual spectacle with meaning. Finally an America movie that deals with what it means being human; living and growing old, and remembering the ones who crossed our paths. Some of those people were memorable. Even more than the ballet-dancer for me the person of this movie was the wonderful swimming lady with the dreamy eerie voice, who couldn't help but redo her attempt to cross the Channel. That was the moment for me, also in the end when she came back. I love movies with breathtaking ends, and this one had, with a small sum-up of all the people as they were through the ages. Any movie that has memorable moments for us is worth the test of time, isn't it? It all looked great and certainly it was big budget money well spent: the scenery, background was lush and wonderful, like one big art deco hotel through the ages. Of course, this as almost any movie, had its problems, too. I think the beginning was awkward. Somehow due to a clock turning backwards we are supposed to believe it's credible babies are born that way. Also the end, which would normally be interesting Â– how do you cope with a baby getting younger and younger Â– was left out to speed thing up. The focus was clearly on the most interesting part; that of our young lives where we do the most things we later remember. From that perspective, the aging backwards would have been an unnecessary element. The movie might have been just as good with Bradd Pitt aging normally. Probably that is a compliment for this flick, since it seems I was also accepting this normally contrived idea of Benjamin aging backwards. Of course, the movie could have been cut here and there, too. I thought it had its best part from the end of the middle on to the title score. That also happened to be the part where Benjamin was an adult in his prime. But then again, maybe the power came from what had been told in earlier parts, so one never really knows. I never really felt this movie had a sagging part. Many reviews call it magical, and sometimes I agree it was. With a price though, since we are never part of the dull ordinary working days of the characters. It truly is the axiom of Hithcock's movies: life with the dull parts taken out. Life as seen from this story seemed like an endless stay in a youth hostel through the years, chatting and meeting interesting people, filled with the nicest pictures as recollection of Benjamin's life. We all know it is not like that. It would also have been interesting to see how this movie would work out showing life how it was with the best parts taken out! I also think telling this story as a flashback from a diary in a hospital was too clichÃ©. It could easily have been solved by maybe interviewing people who directly or indirectly knew him, or something in that style. Sure some Hollywood writers could have come with something better than that. Also the hummingbird was too contrived, too much put in. And maybe after all the CGI and effects, Brad Pitt didn't have to do that much. But Benjamin was still a memorable character, and he happened to be Brad Pitt. So well, an Oscar nomination is deserved, I think. Overall this movie certainly had a great cast, lovely scenery, and a resonance of life being precious and wonderful, themes we all know, but so nice to see again!",9,2,4,31 January 2009
The Da Vinci Code," Doesn't live up to treasure movies from the past
","I usually only write positive comments when I do but this is an exception. Since there have been treasure hunt movies around for a while, it is almost inevitable to compare. Although the cast was not bad in this movie, surely Indiana Jones and also National Treasure were much better. Indiana Jones had the tempo but still also the incomparable nostalgic atmosphere and the effects, where National Treasure was a more modern technique treasure hunt that made up for the lack of nostalgia by the intriguing scenes of e.g. stealing the Declaration itself. Well we have seen them all. The point I want to make is that this movie lacks the right tempo and atmosphere. Also the supposed chemistry between the couple was nowhere to be seen in this movie. The atmosphere was not there either. This despite the fact that the locations were nicely picked and the movie followed the book quite closely. What made the book entertaining was the tantalizingly slow solving of the riddles themselves and the smart flash-forwards. The couple was constantly chased but they didn't know it. In this movie they solved the riddles even quicker than in National Treasure. That took away what could have been the most entertaining part and also the only way to build up tension in this movie. I never had the feeling of being involved in it, nor in the panicky feeling of an endless chase for the grail and of having to stay out of the hands of the police. Probably an extra half an hour could have done the job to slowly build up the tension. In National Treasure there was indeed a beautiful treasure, but here the immensely important grail papers (who were not found in the book) looked more like some notebooks behind glass. They were just mentioned but the scene that showed them was too short. Also the vault behind the church, which according to the book is known but never dug up, could have been a great opportunity for a movie. Make it a night scene with trying to find the right brick to open the secret cellar beneath this church. Could have been a classic treasure hunt scene but this movie missed the opportunity.",5,3,6,4 July 2006
Wedding Crashers," Funny movie, good duo
","I can only say I really enjoyed this one, and that says something since normally I only like British humor. Owen Wilson and his partner fit well together in this movie, and other great cast include Jayne Seymour and Christopher Walken. The story to me is original, I have at least never heard of the concept of visiting weddings uninvited just to pick up gals, but the idea makes us all a bit jealous just about why we don't have the guts ourselves to do the same and join in the fun! Ever since Armageddon I am a fan of Owen Wilson, and he didn't disappoint me in the great remake comedy of Starsky & Hutch (the best comedy of 2004). He did it again with this flick, probably the best comedy of this year! Enjoy!",8,0,1,12 August 2005
Halloween," The absolute very best in the genre
","The reason for my 10 out of 10 rating is that this movie is the archetype horror movie, or, to put it another way, the movie that set the standard for the genre itself. Time has shown that this first one could never be equalled, let alone surpassed. The reason for this is probably that everything that makes a good horror movie (and there are a lot of components that have to perfectly work together) is all present in Halloween 1978 to an almost perfect degree. To sum it up: -There is the excellent acting (esp. the 'sqream queen' JL Curtis)that really portraits fear in stead of merely hysterical teenagers that can make those movies almost ridiculous. Jamie Lee Curtis is totally convincing and an important factor in making the watcher believe that what he sees is real. That of course is what horror tries to achieve, but only rarely happens. The Blair Witch is one of the very few other examples. -There is the brilliant music (which was composed by Carpenter himself in only a weekend!) that does so much to help build up the nasty atmosphere. No other horror movie has used music so effectively to build up the atmosphere than this one. Possibly only The Thing comes close, but it took Ennio Morricone to do it! Some movies use music too much, let it overrule, but in this movie it is in total harmony with all that happens. -There is also the excellent camera-work. An example is the almost misty white mask of the evil Michael Myers in the dark house when Jamie get's stabbed from behind in the end. It makes him almost look nonhuman, alien, like an idea, which in fact he is, the 'evil'. The white that apart from being innocent, can in some cases (white shark) indeed be the face of death. -Also camera angles and effects are there that go almost unnoticed but are highly effective. An example is when Jamie walks with her school friends home. One by one they turn left to their houses, until Jamie is alone on the lane. Suddenly he stands there in front of her, human, not human? Evil himself? Jut as sudden as he is gone, she bumps into..not him, but a police officer. Or later, when Jamie is alone in a room in the house and looks out in the garden. There is an almost mysterious wind, laundry waving in it, and between the white of the blankets and the trees is Michael Myers again, or, as you almost think, not? It almost appeals to the possibility that Michael Myers might not even exist, only in her mind. - Build up of the tension. Probably the most difficult to achieve. In Halloween the tension is built up terrificly, and slowly mounts into an incredible climax in only the last 15 minutes, which are now legendary. The truth that this movie wants to make us believe, is that Michael Myers is human, but at the same time a devil, not human, supernatural. The way he keeps erecting, and disappears in the end, together with all the items I described above, what actually makes you buy it as well. That is an incredible feat, that we all know after laughing at almost any other horror movie we have seen since! This is a serious one that gets in your system!",10,1,2,3 December 2006
The Sixth Sense," The standard for the twist story genre
","I consider this the very best twist-story I have ever seen, followed at great distance by The Others. That I am not the only one, of course, is best shown by the great spin-off, included those by the same director. And even more the fact, that none succeeded to equal, let alone surpass this movie. The movie is compelling and keeps you intrigued to the end, and the end, well, it is legendary. To me it is so brilliant, like you have seen two good movies in one. Many movies of the twist-genre, if I may call it that, do not respect the checklist for endings. And ending should wrap things up, tie up loose ends, without tearing the story we have seen so far apart (in the worst case telling the reader it was all a dream). The sixth sense does this better than any movie before or since. But before I get to that, let's start at the beginning. It started with Bruce Willis getting shot by his former patient, now a grown man still troubled by apparently non-existing phenomena. It gives the right background, since we are introduced to the main character, Bruce Willis, being a child psychologist, who has dropped the ball somewhere along the line. Or not? Was that patient mad? The rest of the story is about Bruce Willis' character seeking redemption for his failure, as he feels it, by trying to do it right next time. That chance comes with the gifted child that is showing the same problems. But before that, remember the cut? After Bruce was gunned down you see him suddenly sitting, the next fall, on a couch outside, waiting for the young boy. It struck me as lonely, and strange. Of course, in hindsight, it was all deliberately put there including the clever camera work and fall setting, as any good story should only contain things that belong there for a reason. I thought: where is the hospital, where is the wife? Why is the atmosphere so lonely, and deserted? Well we know now why, but I did not then, so this was one question, one unsolved delayed bit of information Ã¢â‚¬â€œ always a good thing to keep the reader, or watcher, hooked. Also his contact with his wife: distant, short visits, monologues rather than discussions. I thought they are in a fight, but about what? The end provided the explanation: they were not in a fight, but she could not see him, and she looked sad since she was mourning about her dead husband. A very smart way of twisting a story. It is very hard to do, especially since the whole movie you have seen stays intact, even after the surprise. All you saw happened, only from a different perspective. Just when I started to think the start was too weird, I was intrigued just in time by the ghosts that came along with the little boy Bruce had as a patient. I thought it would end up like Poltergeist, the spirits entering the real world, Bruce having to sacrifice himself, redemption, end. But the real horror came from the people themselves, with of course the climax the video of the dead girl, showing she was poisoned by her stepmother. A very different approach and hard to do, but this movie succeeded in being scary without showing the obvious spooks alone, but with staying in the real world. Take 'The Others', for instance, that movie had the advantage of the claustrophobic effect you automatically get when you choose an isolated place, like the estate they were on. The Sixth Sense only had the open world, a city, as we know it, and the heroes could walk anywhere. Not easy to create a scary atmosphere, there, since the characters could just go away when things got scared, right? But they couldn't , since the ghost where all over the place, too. All the questions I had during the movie were all perfectly wrapped up in the end. I thought: why would Bruce find out now, not earlier or later, he was dead? Well, he had come full circle, he helped the boy where he could not help a boy in the past. If he would let go now, his wife could move on and she was ready, having a new boyfriend. The time was right. The boy, he came full circle too: by listening to the ghosts, he would find out he was no freak since they did exist. They were there and by listening to them he could be of use to the people that they left behind. Also his mother understood her son was just gifted and not a freak, by the somewhat over emotional scene with him telling about her dead mother showing up at some high school event, something he could obviously not have known. It is extremely hard to wrap all things up this perfect, and the reason this movie does it nevertheless, is because it showed a carefully constructed story which was possible to interpret in two ways all the time. By diverting me to the ghosts themselves, I totally forgot to bother about what was going on with Bruce Willis' character himself and his wife, and why it did not fit. It stayed in the back of my head, but the ghosts were even more dominant. Brilliant, you can only do this once. Furthermore I can add the acting is very good, and the camera-work also, especially the scene with the stepmother. So all the way to the end, the movie is surprising, intriguing and scary. It left the Poltergeist or Exorcist approach and by staying in the real world it made the ghosts even more scary, or exciting if that is the word. The end itself is the biggest surprise any movie has shown, and manages yet to leave all you saw intact, even adding a depth to the story. Perfect. A perfect story, made into a perfect movie.
