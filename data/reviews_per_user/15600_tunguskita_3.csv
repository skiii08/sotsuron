The Hangover," Complete garbage
","I am very surprised as how this absolute crap of a movie managed to score 7.7 on imbd! I's unbelievable! As unbeliavable as this gigantic nonsense of a plot! But there is predictability too! Oh really, he put drugs on your drink?? Nobody saw that coming!..
Its as if they wanted to put all the clichetic characters Hollywood as ever had, right in the middle of the way of these 4 weirdos. The mab, the king-fu guy, the tiger dealers.. the lost baby.. It's embarrassing. The tiger scenes alone are just uncomprehensible. The whole thing feels so forced. Aaagh! I couldn't even finish watching this. I just came here to rant and tell you, intelligent viewers, to stay away from this.",1,1,4,16 December 2019
Batman Returns," Feels like a dark Burtonesque Christmas movie.. Alluring! Sublime!
","It's the best Batman movie, one of the best Tim Burton movies, and one iconic Cat girl, Waw Michelle Pfeiffer! She IS the cat woman! Neurotic, dark, sexy, lonely sensitive secretary meets mysterious, sexy heartbroken millionaire superhero?.. Bang! Its Burton Perfection! It's their chemistry I like the most in this movie.. I love all their scenes. And Danny DeVito as The Penguin? Superb!. I know this movie has a good rating, it's just not good enough! The rating should be 10/10. In fact, i feel like watching it again, because it's my all time favourite Christmas movie.",10,1,13,16 December 2019
Her," Empty. Meaningless.
","This was one of those movies that kept me moving in the chair from my total lack of interest in it.OK, it is a pretty movie. OK, it is Spike Jonze. So what?The story promised something interesting, relevant, about human relationships and.. it started off well too.. but as soon as the OS 'appears' my hopes turned to shreds.It is commonplace, boring, empty and futile. It is also a very pretentious movie and the main character is far too self-righteous to be interesting.Clearly they had a good idea in hands, just could not handle it well. Overrated.The sex scene is embarrassing and it would give this movie a -10 in a fair rating. I am sincerely surprised at the current rating of this movie. But time will tell, and time will put this one in Rotten Tomatoes. If you haven't seen it, please, waste no time.",1,10,23,16 April 2014
