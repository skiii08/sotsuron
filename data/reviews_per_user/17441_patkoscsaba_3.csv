Iron Man 3," It was good but I expected better
","Usually Marvel super-hero movies are good, and I like them all. Iron Man 3 was something I was looking for both because it is the first movie after Avengers in Marvel's universe and because I liked the previous 2 Iron Man movies.I am not yet sure if my expectations were to high, or just misplaced, or this movie managed to actually be boring. Special effects were perfect as usual, 3D was acceptable but not that good, but the story and the action... well they were boring. When the movie finished I thought it was a 3 hours movie just to realize it was less than 2 hours long.Does it deserve to be seen? Absolutely. But keep your expectations low, it may help.Finally I gave this movie a 6/10, and I personally think it was the worst modern-day Marvel movie (including Thor, Avengers, Captain America, Hulk, and whatever I can't remember right now).Looking forward to Thor 2. I hope it will be better.",6,2,4,28 April 2013
Mamma Mia!," I think this is the best movie of the last few years
","I think this is the best movie of the last few years. I'm not a particular ABBA fan, but I like their music, and this movie makes it shine again after all those years. I'm 28 and my parents were listening to this music when I was a little boy, so there is a melancholic side of the movie for me. But the way the music is embedded in the story it is just fantastic. And when you think that everything is sang by actors so authentic and beautiful ... this film is the perfect entertainment for young and old, for single and family ...Best movie for me, hope it will get some Oscar's next year.PS: Happy new year!",10,3,6,30 December 2008
Avatar," Good, but not THAT good!
","THE HOLE POST IS SOMEWHAT A SPOILER, SO DON'T REED IT IF YOU DID NOT SEE THE MOVIE!So, I've seen it. I am a big SF fan, I saw almost all SF movies and series made in the past 30-40 years or so.However, Avatar did not impress me that much. The story is just a classic 'humans are bad' tale, with a scientist who is not listened to ... too typical and too old story. So if you are looking for a great story, look somewhere else.On the other hand, the special effect, the view, the blending of reality with CGI is perfect. You almost can't tell what is real and what is not. For the hole view and CGI I give this movie a 10, but for story I give it a 0, so the result is a 5 from me.For one, I consider this a great entertainment, this is a must see movie, but I will not watch it again, that's for sure.",5,1,3,28 April 2010
