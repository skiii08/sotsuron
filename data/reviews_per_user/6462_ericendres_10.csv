Miracle," 95% based on a true story, and that's a miracle! (9/10)
","I had the chance to meet goalie Jim Craig recently when he spoke for a company retreat I attended. I asked him how much of 'Miracle' was accurate and how much was Hollywood. He said it was 95% accurate, right down to the dialogue, and having seen the film now, I don't doubt him. And there's little reason why it shouldn't have been that way, as the real story is certainly compelling enough to tell without embellishment.
In most sports movies, even ones that are 'based on true stories', there are cliches added in, like the last second touchdown pass and the come-from-behind victory against the towering undefeated opponent. Well, in 'Miracle', there are indeed last second goals and come-from-behind victories and strings of incredible saves by the goalie, but all you have to do is watch the 'making of' feature on the DVD where the action from the movie is shown next to the actual footage and you realize that it is exactly as it really happened. Mark Johnson really did score with 1 second left to tie the game at the end of the period, etc.I was about 10 years old when I eagerly watched the games on TV, but I couldn't remember some of the details and it was powerful to realize the real impact of what was accomplished, and how it was accomplished, which I couldn't really appreciate at that age.The filmmakers did a terrific job with this film. The story of coach Herb Brooks (very strongly played by Kurt Russell) and the teamwork that he developed among the players makes for a compelling story, and the hockey action is superbly filmed. The decision to cast hockey players and teach them to act, as opposed to casting actors and trying to teach them to skate and play hockey seems like an obvious one in retrospect, but must have been made with some hesitancy and should be applauded. The hockey looks and feels very real, and that is not easy to capture. And the acting is certainly good enough, and why wouldn't it be when the 'actors' are portraying hockey players?? Not a stretch, really.The victory at the end (it's not really a spoiler to say that, eh?) could have gone over the top with schmaltz and patriotic fireworks, but had just the right touch, capturing the kind of excitement and joy that we all felt sharing that moment.Congratulations to the makers of 'Miracle' for making one of the best sports films ever, and moreso congratulations to Herb Brooks and the 1980 U.S. Hockey team for giving us the incredible story to see!",9,1,1,24 May 2004
Finding Nemo," Another outstanding Pixar film! 10/10
","I'm 34 years old, and have had a fairly wide variety of film tastes over the years, but I am not ashamed to say that I realized recently that the group of Pixar films are among my very favorites.  Such entertainment is rare in any film, and they have achieved that every time out so far- Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and now with Finding Nemo. These are all movies you can see several times and always enjoy and find new things in.Even moreso than other Pixar films, Nemo is a real visual treat, with the underwater world being beautifully rendered by the animators. But what really sets the Pixar movies apart from many other animated films is the strength of the writing. The visuals of an animated feature can be terrific in any film, but the story and the characters are what will make or break it. Finding Nemo, like the other Pixar films has a wealth of unique and engaging characters, a compelling storyline, and lots of humor and adventure. Andrew Stanton and John Lasseter and the others at Pixar should be given a lot of credit for being among the very best storytellers out there today. Bravo!",10,0,0,19 June 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Meh... A good setup for Ep. III, I suppose...
","Finally saw AOTC last night. Not bad. It was a Star Wars movie, alright. I enjoyed some parts of it. On the whole, I'd say it was as good as Phantom Menace and even better than Return of the Jedi. But still, somewhat lacking, as Phantom Menace was, in terms of overall excitement. I found myself yawning a few times there, and it seemed telling that though the theater was packed with kids, there was no fanfare among them. When I saw Star Wars and Empire, there was a tangible and very audible excitement there. I think the effects and creatures and spaceships flying through space just aren't all that impressive anymore, especially when you don't have a really compelling story and characters to root for within all of that.Things I liked: No denyin' that Yoda with the light saber was very cool. It almost seemed incongruous, though, that he hobbles up on a cane, then flips around at breakneck speed with his light saber, then hobbles away on a cane again. I guess he just saves it up for the saberin'! I also liked a few of the series threads that were thrown in there, like when Obi-Wan tells Anakin- 'Someday you'll be the death of me.' I think the development of Anakin's dark side was done pretty well. The sequence in the blast furnace place where they were making droids was both exciting and clever. Kind of neat that both George Lucas and Spielberg had similar scenes in their latest films, with Spielberg's 'Minority Report' automobile manufacturing fight scene. I think the best thing about this film may be that it seems to set up the next film to be a real barnburner in many ways.Things I didn't like: I agree with some critics who called the dialogue utilitarian, and that there too much of it. It was like watching C-Span at some points. I understand the concept of what's going on, and it's not that it's disinteresting, but as plots go, it doesn't exactly engender much excitement. Too much happened that was expected, and very little that was out of the ordinary, in the way of the action sequences and effects. I really think it's telling that as intricate as a lot of those action and effects sequences were, they don't seem to have much impact anymore. Flying through the asteroid field... That was done in Empire already, and it was new and exciting then, but just ho-hum now. You see some strange looking creatures in some bar, and at this point it's like, 'okay, whatever'. But in the Star Wars cantina it was pretty damn cool. I know you can't really compare your perception from now to then, and these movies may be introducing these kinds of things to a new generation (although kids today have seen similar effects and action stunts in dozens of other contemporary movies), but I still think there were more compelling stories and characters in the first two movies, by far. But hey, it's the world of Star Wars, nonetheless, and it's a cool world, to be sure. But this movie, even moreso than Phantom Menace, seemed just like more of the same. I also had to conclude that Natalie Portman was miscast in that role. She's beautiful, yes, but man, is her delivery weak and monotone... Part of that is the dialogue, which rarely seems to be character specific, or have any life to it. One person says something that another could say easily as well, with the exception being Yoda, who just says everything backwards, and throws in some wisdom here and there. C-3PO had about the ONLY humor in the whole movie, and it was groaners. I don't recall Star Wars having much humor, but this one needed it more than that.",Null,0,0,22 August 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Nothing spectacular...
","I was disappointed with this movie. It's not that I 'disliked' it, but it all seemed so ordinary, and typical. Nothing really inventive or spectacular. Fight some orcs, carry around a ring, whisper to each other about strange portents and impending evil, travel around a bit, fight some more orcs... For a three-hour movie, it left me with very, very little that was memorable. I thought the smoke ship going through the smoke ring, and Gandalf's fireworks were creative, and gave a sense of wonder, and I expected more of the same after that, but didn't get it. Some fantastic scenery, but does that really give credit to a film, or to God?? Elijah Wood, as Frodo, had the same pained expression on his face the whole movie. Vitto Morgenson and Ian MacKellen were both fitting for their roles, as were others, but there wasn't all that much to the roles themselves. I suppose that's the problem of trying to condense an epic story into a comparatively brief movie. One thing I found annoying is how everyone seemed to whisper their lines, especially during what would seem to be the important conversations. That seems to be a convention of acting and films these days, and it's baffling. It's as if everyone has laryngitis, or is in a library. The fight scenes were, well, fight scenes. Again, nothing special or different than what might be expected. Good guys kill everyone with one blow, and can take several blows themselves and survive. And when the two wizards fight each other, what could have been an interesting confrontation seems unfulfilled. My wife commented that the sound effects for the orcs sounded as if they were pulled from a stock sound effects CD or something.I don't mean to totally bash the film, but it's as though it would have made an incredible TV miniseries, but not a great FILM series. For something that should have been REALLY COOL, it just misses the mark of ever reaching that. Sadly, in the preview for the next film (attached onto the end - the first time I've ever seen that!), it doesn't look like we're in for much better next time. Looks about the same, which is not surprising, as they were all filmed together. Perhaps the story might be more interesting, and they might do more, instead of just evading orcs, so that might be good.That this has been ranked #3 of all time is truly astounding. I'm just glad it has now been bumped down from #2. Shawshank Redemption deserves that place much more than this movie.",7,1,2,6 June 2002
Big Fish," Only mildly entertaining/resonating
","I guess expectations will get you more often than not. I'm a fan of much of Tim Burton's work, and the accolades declaring this to be a new 'Wizard of Oz' were encouraging, but as it turns out, I was more entertained by that other recent film with the similar premise - Secondhand Lions.
Big Fish started with promise as it sets up the metaphor and mythos of its story, but about halfway through it all becomes rather ho-hum. I like where Burton was reaching with this, which was higher than Secondhand Lions was reaching, but it really failed to resonate or captivate in the way it seems to try so hard to. Secondhand Lions knew it was a light comedy, seen from the eyes of a child coming of age, and it was successful in that sense. Big Fish didn't seem to know what it was... it wasn't really all that funny... or dramatic... or romantic... though it had slight aspects of each. And with the protagonist a jaded adult (Billy Crudup), it just wasn't as captivating to experience as compared to Haley Joel Osment's youth in Lions.Some good performances, especially Ewan McGregor as the younger Edward Bloom, but unfortunately the film is nowhere near as entertaining or resonating as other Burton fare such as Edward Scissorhands or Ed Wood. Hmm... Burton likes characters named 'Ed', eh?6 out of 10",6,2,3,10 May 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Beautiful, indeed!
","I've seen this movie three times now, and it has now entered the ranks of one of my very favorite films ever, perhaps even my very favorite. It's so wonderful, and touching, and funny, and romantic, and poignant, and sad, and triumphant. What an achievement. I know some people balk when I recommend this film to them and mention that it has subtitles, but really, everyone should watch this film and enjoy its beauty and be buoyed by its spirit. Bravo, Roberto!-EE-",10,3,5,7 February 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," A terrific movie with layers of meaning...
","I've seen this movie about a half-dozen times now, and it's slowly occurred to me that this is one of my two or three very favorite films. Each time I've seen it, I can appreciate different things about it, and the depth of the dialogue, and the meaning behind the events and characters takes on different symbolism and significance.Having just read the story this was based on, I find it a rare example of where the film is better than the book. Not that the book isn't good, but there are some significant changes in the film that helped to make it such an endearing piece of work, and a more powerful experience than the original short story was. The development of the characters of the warden, and Brooks, for example, really fleshes out the story well.The acting and direction is perfectly subtle and restrained, and though the feel may be a bit slow at times for some people, it gives a good sense of the feeling of time slowly dripping by in these people's lives.
What a shame that this was nominated for so many Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor (Morgan Freeman), and adapted screenplay, cinematography, music, etc., but didn't win anything. Granted, 'Forrest Gump' is a great film, too, but it would have been nice if 'Shawshank' had at least won something. Oh, well, that's not really important in the big picture, I suppose. The fact that this film is ranked #2 of all time here is very telling, and I'm sure it will be appreciated for a very long time to come... I know that every time it comes on TNT, I have to watch it again!",10,0,0,5 April 2001
Signs," Pretty good, if not M. Knight's best.
","Having enjoyed Sixth Sense and particularly Unbreakable, I was looking forward to seeing this. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I wouldn't put it up there with those previous two films. There were some nice scenes, though, and he has a way of getting some nice spiritual moments to ring through in a way that feels right. My favorite moment was actually the goofiest, when there was the videocam capture of the alien at the children's birthday party (a nice Bigfoot cop, btw). It was kind of goofy, really, but also gave me the feeling of what it would be like to be seeing that in the situation the characters were in, and therefore the reaction was shocking as intended. I thought the performances were very good, particularly Joachin Phoenix (who I didn't like at all in Gladiator). His reactions to what was going on helped make it believable (for example, when seeing the video of the alien). If anything, the film seemed a bit too short. It took a while to get going, and then once it got going a little, it ended. I like what I saw, but I guess I expected a little more, as opposed to Unbreakable and Sixth Sense, which seemed a little more satisfying as a whole. Still worth seeing, though. I think Shyamalan is one of the best filmmakers today, and I like that he doesn't have sex and blood and excessive violence and swearing in his films.7 out of 10",7,0,1,25 February 2003
Thirteen Days," Great film if you get past Costner's accent...
","A very well done film showing the inner workings and politics involved in what must have been an incredibly difficult and tense period in world history.But why oh why does Kevin Costner continue to insist on trying to speak in an accent other than his own??? His own voice would have been just fine for that role, and it's not as though anyone really knows who that guy is or what he's supposed to sound like. This is film. This is illusion. Don't spoil it with a terrible attempt at an accent! I actually found the actor playing JFK to have underplayed JFK's real accent, and I certainly didn't miss that, or feel that the part wasn't done well because he didn't cop as much of an accent as JFK had. Actually, I blame the director for allowing Costner's accent in the film, but then again, if we're to believe the stories about Costner exerting his 'clout' on films, it may have been beyond the director's control.But this is still a very good film, bad accent notwithstanding! :o)",Null,0,0,30 August 2002
Gladiator," One big 'meh'...
","Ay, carumba... I was looking forward to this film, as I generally like these types of films, and I was thinking it would contain some epic qualities of action, intrigue, characterization, etc. However, this was one big 'meh', and I ended up regretting the time it took to watch over a few days during my lunch hour!The picture just wasn't very exciting or interesting. There was nothing in it that I didn't expect to happen as I watched it. The characters were predictably bland. Even the fight scenes were rather ho-hum. Just a lot of bashing and blood, which is probably what it really was like, but you know, in a film, you expect some more kind of essence or drama to it. The final fight between Maximus and Commodus? Who cared, by that point? There was very little artistry or drama to something that should have been quite a powerful confrontation... I agree with Roger Ebert's review that the look of it was very dark and bland and depressing, both visually and in terms of character.What's really baffling is how this was awarded best picture of the year, and Crowe as best actor, and that what's his name playing Commodus was even nominated for an Oscar! Yikes. I mean, I suppose it may have been a weak year, and you certainly can't count on the Best Picture being the 'best picture', but you expect it to at least have something significant to it. This had very, very little to it. I think of just two years ago, when the Best Pic noms were - Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and Thin Red Line. Every one of those movies had so much more to them than this film does. It's almost ridiculous, the difference there. Not to mention others that weren't even nominated that year, like Truman Show and Gods and Monsters...Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (that's his name!) were both rather unspectacular, mumbling their way through their lines like David Mamet's mock GREAT ACTOR would. (It's no wonder they were rewarded so!) They just didn't really cement themselves into those roles, particularly Phoenix. I can think of several others who could have done that part, and might have been more interesting. Then again, it could have been the direction, or the script, but his character actually seemed to have some of the more interesting things to say, so that probably rules that out. And it's not so much that Crowe was bad in the part, but it just wasn't that much of a part. He fights, he looks veangeful and sad, he mumbles a few lines, he fights some more, he longs for his family, fights some more... Not all that much to dig into, really. I haven't seen The Insider or A Beautiful Mind yet, but I must imagine that there's a lot more for him to have been 'best actor' for in those characters and films.There were some little things here and there that were alright, and some of the minor characters did well, but on the whole, a pretty big waste of time to watch...-EE-",6,0,1,7 February 2002
