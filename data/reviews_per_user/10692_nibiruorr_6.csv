Spartacus," Spartacus: Always best on the big screen.
","Recently, a local neighborhood theater (I'm not at liberty to name the theater chain for reasons of copyright violation, you understand) showcased a major theatrical road show trifecta: I was able to thrill at the sight of seeing such epic greats of a Hollywood long since passed as 'The 10 Commandments' (1956), 'Ben-Hur' (1959), and, of course 'Spartacus' (1960). I'm given to understand that Kirk Douglas along with others being considered for the title role of 'Ben-Hur' such as Paul Newman, Rock Hudson, and several unknown hopefuls, were tested for the role, including Douglas, before Charlton Heston landed the coveted role but as consolation, Douglas was offered the role of the Ben-Hur's erstwhile friend, and, later foe, Messala. To counteract his disappointment, Douglas, through the auspices of his own production company Bryna Productions and securing the rights to Howard Fast's bestseller, produced and crafted 'Spartacus'. Displeased with director Delbert Mann's efforts, Douglas discharged him and hired the new kid on the block, Stanley Kubrick (who, was constantly at odds with Douglas, and, it is alleged, disowned the film). The only concession Hollywood was forced to make was Douglas' choice of screenwriter to adapt Fast's novel, the grey and black listed Dalton Trumbo. In point of fact, with all the obstacles presenting a troubled shoot, i.e., choice of acting styles, arguments on the set, etc., it's something of a minor miracle that Douglas was able to pull it off at all. But the net results are truly outstanding. And while I personally own 'Spartacus' in Blu-ray, seeing it up on the big screen once more was like visiting an old friend.",10,0,0,19 May 2014
North by Northwest," Hitchcock at his entertaining best.
","Sandwiched in between Hitchcock's daylit noir 'Vertigo' (1958) and his macabre comedy 'Psycho' (1960) is 'North By Northwest' (1959). His reverting to type as a director of espionage films,  a genre that was begun by Fritz Lang's Dr Mabuse series of films, Hitchcock fine tuned the espionage thriller until he made it uniquely his own. What better actor to play the lead than Hollywood's mostromantic leading man, Cary Grant, whom Hitchcock had cast in three other films, 'Suspicion' (1941-opposite Joan Fontaine), 'Notorious' (1946-opposite IngridBergman) and 'To Catch A Theif' (1954-opposite Grace Kelly). To play a man in a grey flannel suit enmeshed in a web of deceit and a game of musical identities, Grant is suave and amusing with remarkable survival skills-survivors on reality TV-eat your heart out! But Hitch's pinache is very much in evidence applying a lighter touch here than in any of his previous films  (including Mr and Mrs Smith, a comedy-1941). The pace is so brisk you wonder where the time has flown. And speaking of flown. The cropduster sequence is required text book material atmost film schools across the country. But there are so many other set pieces in this film one tends to lose count. Grant's vertiginous night drive  ('You didn't borrow Laura's Mercedes') in a drunken stupor. The high over head shot ofGrant leaving the murder scene as he dashes for a cab in front of the UNbuilding. His romantic encounter in the dining car aboard the Twentieth Century Limited with Eva Marie Saint (the classic Hitchcock blonde).  That magnificent Frank Lloyd Wright hideaway complete with landing field belonging to equallysuave villain James Mason. And that wild descent down the granite faces ofMount Rushmore-the literal cliff-hanger! Hitch's 'Saboture' (1942) may haveprovided the master builder with a blueprint for this film but 'North ByNorthwest' confirmed Hitchcock's status as film auteur par excellance and the true 'master of suspense'.There are so many wonderful lines in 'North By Northwest' it is hard to chose. But if I had to pick only one, it would be the scene in the auction gallery where Grant  finding Eva Marie Saint together with James Mason and his henchman (21 year old Martin Landau), surprises all three by showing up unexpectedly withthe line: 'Now there's a picture only Charles Adams could draw.'",Null,0,0,15 June 2003
The Exorcist," The Devil's in the details.
","The story goes that future Hollywood scribe Blatty while a student attending the Jesuit University at Georgetown back in 1949, came across a curious item in the Washington Post involving a 14 year old Mt. Rainier youth plagued by demons, not the psychological or drug-addled kind but the bona fide supernatural variety, undergoing the ancient ritual of exorcism (the casting out of said demons). Flash-forward after years of paying his dues in Hollywood, Blatty would later base certain aspects of the incident mostly entailing the ritual and cant involved as the basis for his runaway bestseller 'The Exorcist'. Oscar winning filmmaker Friedkin ('The French Connection') realized it as the perfect follow up as he was on a winning streak, and, the rest, as they say, is cinema history. It was certainly a blockbuster when it premiered in 1973 and has earned its reputation as the scariest movie ever made over the years. Those unseen forces and invisible agencies for both good and evil notwithstanding, it's also quality filmmaking. The effects by Marcel Vercoutere are more mechanical in nature rather than those effects involving traveling mattes, matte art, etc. but are no less compelling in its depiction of bilious graphic horror (a later reissue was retouched using a few digital effects) and the demonic makeup by Dick Smith goes beyond grotesque, it's downright sickening. Not to mention, language so strong it would make David Mamet shrivel up in a corner and die. But it was those powerful four letter invectives along with other aspects of the script that won Blatty his coveted Oscar for Best Screenplay.",9,0,2,11 May 2014
To Kill a Mockingbird," Farewell Atticus. You will be missed. Gregory Peck 1916-2003
","It seems sad when you think that all that is best in a man, personal integrity, nobility, generosity, tolerance, self-sacrifice for family and friends, a willingness to put one's entire reputation on the line for others, was never more eloquently expressed than in the pages of a book in the character of Atticus Finch in Harper Lees' To Kill A Mockingbird'. Sadder still because there was only one actor born to play him on the screen, who, like Atticus, embodied all those qualities in every characterization he brought to the screen. And that actor has gone. Whether he was a young priest struggling with ignorance and poverty in post war China in 'Keys to the Kingdom' (44). Become loving father to both his son and an orphaned fawn in the Florida wilds in 'The Yearling' (46)  or an idealistic journalist out to single-handedly fight religious intolerance in 'Gentlemen's Agreement' (47).  A tough as nails upper echelon flight commander expecting no less than perfection from his men in '12 O'Clock High' (49). Or at home with light comedy  'Roman Holiday' (53) and 'Designing Women' (56). Gregory Peck was spot on everytime. And it has been said of him that he was one of those rare talents incapable of giving a bad performance. He may have been the wrong choice for the part as his Captain Ahab was in John Huston's 'Moby Dick' (56). But even when he went over the top, it was always at the right pitch as in 'The Boys From Brazil' (72) or 'The Omen' (74). But it was his honest portrayal as Atticus Finch which will long be remembered. The everyman who became the voice of the American conscience at a time when the civil rights issue was weighing heavily on our minds. Sad because there will never be another character so uniquely American and so perfectly heroic in literature. Nor another actor capable of epitomizing Atticus with such tenacious force that is only found in the human spirit when the highest ideals we cherish are to be compromised.  But, perhaps, that's not a reason to mourn. For each time we read Harper Lee's book we think of Gregory Peck, and, each time we view Peck's Oscar winning performance we think how accurately he came to Lee's indomitable Atticus.  A fact recognized by the American Film Institute's tribute to the 100 all time greatest screen heroes with Atticus/Peck # 1 on the list. After all, how many of us will ever be able to say, 'now that's the way I wish to be remembered'.",Null,1,2,12 June 2003
Ben-Hur," A Sweep at the Oscars: Wyler's Ben Hur
","You have to give this film's detractors credit for trying. But there are just some films that are inviolate. They can NOT be tarnished no matter how much the self-made critic protests. It seems a futile effort in any case given the age of some of the truely great films. In the book, 'Movies in America' 1929-1969, (currently out of print as the names of the authors escapes me.) the authors' remarks reflected the changing esthetics of the time referring to MGM's color remake as an 'above average quasi-Biblical  spectacle with a fine piece de resistance'-the chariot race.  Over lauded with accolades for every season: Winner of 11 Academy Awards (losing best adapted screenplay to 'Room at the Top'.) Best picture winner: The NY Film Critics Circle Award. Best picture winner: The British Film Academy.  Best picture winner: Golden Globe Award. Sam Zimbalist received the Producers Guild Award and Wyler the Directors Guild Award. Among the great and powerful men of letters, film critic for the NY Times, Bosley Crowther-champion of religion in modern cinema-rendered a glowing review. Whereas Dwight MacDonald-reviewer for Cosmopolitan- panned it vociferously likening the whole viewing experience to watching 'a lumbering freight train as it passes' However, it's a fair assessment of this film's endurance when one considers the ratings poll  and how it ranks a point or two above Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' as a film still very  much in high demand in sales and rentals. So is it great? Well, I believe that's subject to individual tastes. Is it a masterpiece? That could be safely said of any film that does well both critically and commercially. Is it a keeper? That's a definite **** out of five stars. Yes. I'd say so.",Null,2,5,15 June 2003
Godzilla," 'King of the Monsters' returns for another shot at the big screen.
","When you consider that this Japanese Kaiju creation, which, translated into English, literally means 'strange beast or creature' was Japan's response to the destruction and devastation in the aftermath of the atomic bomb leveling Hiroshima and Nagasaki, any remake (or, reboot, to those of you are hip to the current terminology presently in use) seems irrelevant in 2014 and on. SPOILER ALERT: Yes, Warner Brothers is planning on a follow up sequel. Still, director Gareth Edwards and screenwriters Max Borenstein (screenplay) and Dave Callaham (story) have done their best to retain the spirit of those films back when 'Godzilla' was King of the Monsters rampaging and stomping through an already downtrodden Tokyo. How and why 'Godzilla' (back in the day when ol' radioactive breath was brought to life through suitmation, スーツメーション) would eventually become a celebrated champion capable of committing giganticide of any and all post-atomic mutations threatening Japan is a process which most creatures (the Wolf Man, Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, et.al.), emerging from mere legend must undergo before passing into popular folklore. So, I suppose for this reason more than any other, the fact that talk of a sequel currently in the works is a good thing, because, 'it's good to be the king'!",7,3,5,15 November 2014
