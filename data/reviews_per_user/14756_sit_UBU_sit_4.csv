The Ring," One of the best comedies of 2002
","THE RING is absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had the displeasure of viewing. It ranks right up there with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE GODFATHER PART III, SIGNS, THE VILLAGE and FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.I was 28 years old when I saw this and was laughing out loud during several parts of the movie. The part where the girl comes through the TV at the end had me almost on the floor. I don't understand how people are scared by this. If you little teenyboppers want to see a real scary movie, go watch Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING or THE EXORCIST.This movie is just really, really bad. Save your money. I can't believe the sequel is now the #1 movie in America.",1,2,6,21 March 2005
The Godfather: Part III," One of the worst films ever made
","Let me preface by saying 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather Part II' are two of the greatest films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola had a lot to live up to when he made 'The Godfather Part III.' First off, I fault the casting department for casting Sofia 'the only reason I'm here is cause daddy's the director' Coppola. Baby, stick to screen writing. YOU CANNOT ACT!!! Her performance as Connie and Carlo's baby in 'The Godfather' was more convincing than her performance in this rubbish-fest as Michael and Kay's daughter. Secondly, Andy Garcia was terrible in this. What was he supposed to be? Italian or Mexican? He couldn't get an accent down to save his life. This simply does not have the magic or the fire of the first two films. It has poor writing and very poor acting. Even the great Al Pacino or Tuco from 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly' (Eli Wallach) could not save this pile of rubbish. These reasons are why I deny the existence of 'The Godfather Part III.' The Godfather saga ends with Michael Corleone sitting in his chair of his Lake Tahoe home contemplating why he just had his brother murdered. End of story.",1,14,26,3 January 2005
Signs," One of the best comedies of 2002!
","SIGNS is a truly awful movie. M. Night Shamalyn first gave us the wonderful THE SIXTH SENSE, then the underrated UNBREAKABLE. His third effort just falls flat on its face with more plot holes than a Swiss cheese factory.The dialog was terrible 'daddy there's a monster under my bed can I have some water', it was horribly acted and there were several plot holes that made the movie very unbelievable.Save your money unless you want to have a comedy night at your home. You can rent this and THE RING. I can guarantee you will be rolling on the floor laughing. I know I was.",1,1,2,21 March 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," A brilliant piece of film-making by Danny Boyle
","An orphaned 18-year old Indian teen named Jamal is within one question of winning the grand prize on the Hindi version of 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.' When the show breaks for the night, he is arrested and questioned by local police, who can't believe a 'slumdog' would have such vast knowledge. I really don't want to give too much of the plot away, but this is a brilliant film. The way the story is told is quite unique, especially the stories behind how Jamal knows the answers to some of the questions. Find a theatre that is playing this film and go see it. Hopefully in over a month, it will be announced as 'Best Picture' at the Academy Awards and it will be well deserving.",9,1,3,18 January 2009
