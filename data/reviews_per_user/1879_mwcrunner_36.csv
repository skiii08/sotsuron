10 Cloverfield Lane," Terrifying and As Good As the First One Even Though Different Story
","This is a really good sequel to the original Cloverfield even though its story is a little bit different from where its left off of the plot of the first movie. I also know that these alien monsters are definitely related to the monster from the first movie. Also that bomb shelter that John Goodman's character took that woman in looked pretty nice which just could come in handy for anyone in case of a nuclear war. Now if a nuclear war were to happen that'll be me, my family and my girlfriend playing board games and charades, watching movies and TV episodes on the VHS, DVD player or Blu-ray player, reading books, eating a lifetime supply of food, having many bedrooms and bathrooms, doing laundry and listening to music on a stereo or jukebox in a bomb shelter like that. I wouldn't want to be in a shelter with a psychopath like John Goodman's character though and that was pretty freaky after his character got acid on himself and he looked like a monster there. I also wonder how all this got from New York all the way to Texas. Oh well my guess is that after that monster invaded New York, his alien friends started to invade more of the country. Its sort of a War of the Worlds thing. Good movie anyway and it keeps you at the edge of your seat.",8,0,2,29 March 2016
It," You'll float too! You'll float too!
","This is like the best scary movie I've ever seen in my whole life.The acting was incredible and everything was so more realistic then in the dumb 1990 TV movie. Tim Curry is an OK actor but he's not as good as Bill Skarsgard. Skarsgard is the best Pennywise ever. This movie is filled with frights and emotions too. It made me think of everything I ever have been afraid of. It also is based on everything the book had, unlike the dumb 1990 version. Georgie's arm being torn off, The clown, the leper, this painting figure, Georgie, Beverly's child molesting abusive dad, and the best final battle scene between the Losers Club and It. Of course there is part 2 to this and that will come out who knows when. Anyway this movie is the scariest movie I've ever seen in my whole life and the best horror movie ever. 10 out 10.",10,10,21,9 September 2017
World War Z," Zombie Piece of Garbage
","There is not a single thing I like about this zombie flick at all cause its not entirely based on the book and the book had more then just one story unlike this film. This is a film that I would not recommend to anyone. I mean the ending to this film is terrible. All it did was show Brad Pitt's character and his family in a boat somewhere on the west coast or the east coast and it had no meaning at all. Also the zombies in this movie reminded me of all those zombies in the video game Left 4 Dead for the Xbox 360. I mean if you're gonna make a film based on a novel, at least make it mostly based on the plot of the novel. This is definitely one of the worst films I've ever seen in my life. This film should've been scratched.",1,2,4,30 March 2016
Zootopia," Really Good Disney Movie Here
",One of my favorite parts of this movie was the sloths. They cracked me up. When I get married some day I'm gonna watch this movie with my future kids. Also I felt bad for Nick during his childhood when he was bullied and no kid deserves to be bullied. Judy Hopps is also cool. I also can't believe that the villain in this movie was that lamb and she was a secret villain just like Prince Hans in Frozen. I also like the song from this movie. Its pretty good too. I don't know much about Shakira though. This movie can also teach kids to keep moving forward. I also really like rabbits and Judy Hopps and Thumper are the cuddliest rabbits ever.,10,4,12,25 March 2016
The Notebook," A very beautiful and powerful love story
","This movie is both beautiful and tear jerking in every way. It's a great adaption on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are both very great at their roles in this. In the book Noah and Allie meet each other as teenagers in the 30's until they take a break from each other for 14 years and then reunite when Allie is engaged to Lon Hammond Jr and Lon Hammond lets Allie be with Noah cause he understood the love between them. Now in this movie Noah and Allie's relationship is both romantic and sometimes complicated. Despite their differences they were crazy for each other. Now the movie officially takes place during the 40's and that was during the time of segregation and Noah had an African American friend. Also when Noah and Allie were making love in Allies house, Allies parents come home and find them and Allies parents tell her to stay away from Noah and Noah had no choice but to leave Allie for a while. After that happened he goes off into war during World War 2 and he writes letters to Allie every day, but Allies mother hides the love letters from Noah and Allie meets Lon Hammond Jr and becomes engaged to him which is the worst mistake she makes. Then after the war Noah sees Allie again and they both have dinner together and go on a boat ride together until it starts to rain. Then they realize how much they've missed each other and make love in the house that Noah refurbished after it had been around since the early days of America. Then Allie realizes that she had to go back to Lon Hammond but Noah opposes this and asks Allie what her decision is and Allie decides to go back to Lon Hammond. When she goes back to him she tells him about Noah and their love for each other. At first Lon Hammond is angry about this but then decides to let Allie be with Noah. After this happens Noah and Allie get married and have beautiful children together and they also have grandchildren. Now they were living in a nursing home together cause Allie had Alzheimer's which is sad cause it happens to a lot of old people each year and one of the best ways to prevent Alzheimer's is to drink green tea. Every now and again though the Allie that Noah fell in love with and married comes around until the Alzheimer's Allie comes back and she loses her memory. Later that night which was their last night on Earth Noah crawls into bed with the sick Allie for he was dying as well since he had heart attacks before and to his very eyes the real Allie comes around one last time and this made Noah feel grateful. Then they both lie in bed and their souls descend into heaven. Indeed this is a very powerful and beautiful love story and one of the best love stories ever. Both sad and beautiful here.",10,1,2,21 May 2016
Finding Nemo," Amazing and brilliant Disney/Pixar story
","This is one of the best Pixar films ever. Finding Nemo is a story about family and encouragement. We also get a lesson in life from a very special blue tang fish. Just keep swimming. It was very sad at the beginning when that barracuda ate Marlin's wife Coral and all their babies except for Nemo of course and Nemo had a damaged fin which is very small. Ever since then Marlin became very overprotective of Nemo and Nemo became mad with him and swims out into the open ocean to this boat and was taken by these divers and he's taken to this fish tank in a dentist office in Sydney, Australia. There Nemo meets an interesting group of fish including this fish named Gill who tried to get out of the dentist office so many times. We also kind of know the origin how he got that scar on his side and fin. Meanwhile Marlin meets this blue tang fish named Dory who suffers from short term memory loss and they run into sharks named Bruce, Anchor and Chum who were vegetarians until Bruce goes savage after smelling Dory's blood and then Marlin and Dory run into this angler fish and they soon learn the location of where Nemo is after reading the address on the strap of the divers mask and then get directions from a school of fish who do impressions and then go over a trench and bounce through a forest of jellyfish. Then they go through the East Australian Current riding with a group of sea turtles and then go inside a whale and get all the way to Sydney. Meanwhile Gill and Nemo almost make the perfect plan for escape, until the dentists daughter Darla who kills fish out of bad behavior comes and Nemo was about to become her birthday present until Nemo plays dead in order to escape. Then Marlin, Dory and Nigel come in and started a scene in order to rescue Nemo until the dentist chases them out and Darla starts shaking Nemo in the bag until Gill stops her and sends Nemo down the drain which leads to the ocean. Meanwhile Marlin was sad cause he thought Nemo was actually dead and then Dory finds Nemo and brings him to Marlin and then Dory gets caught in a fish net with other fish. Then Nemo comes up with a plan in order to rescue Dory and that was to have all the fish swim down and he lead them down while Marlin was telling them to swim down and it worked. All the fish and Dory were free and then Marlin, Dory and Nemo go back home to their reef and Marlin now knew that Nemo could be responsible. This movie has incredible voice acting and a brilliant and amazing story with plenty of laughs and emotional moments.",10,0,1,25 June 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Worst X-Men movie ever.
",This is the worst movie in the X-Men franchise. Now we do see in this movie all the origins of Wolverine like he was born in the 19th century and has lived on since then and then we see him get his metal claws. Still the rest of the plot of this movie isn't very good and the guy who played Gambit in this didn't do a very good job. We also see Blob in this but he wasn't even working for the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in this. Also what's the idea of having Deadpool in this when his mouth is sewed completely shut? Good thing Deadpool is a lot better in his own movie then he was in this piece of crap. Also Deadpool has a healing factor too and he can regenerate limbs as well and we haven't seen Wolverine do that. Anyway this movie is just plain horrible. One of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. This movie doesn't deserve a lot of credit.,1,1,3,27 May 2016
X-Men," Very good here.
",This is a very good movie based on the X-Men comics. Sir Ian McKellen does an excellent performance as Magneto and Patrick Stewart also makes a great performance of Professor Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman does his best as Wolverine and he's my favorite X-Men member. I sometimes wish though that I had Magneto's powers so that I can lift cars during traffic rush hours. lol. We see great action in this especially when Storm is fighting Sabretooth and Toad. Cyclops is cool too. Also it was a very good idea at the end to have Magneto in a prison made of plastic since lifting plastic is not part of Magneto's abilities. A good beginning to the X-Men movie franchise here.,8,0,0,27 May 2016
Cloverfield," Terrifying and Really Good
","This is like one of the best monster movies I've seen. I really do wonder what it would be like if that monster got into a fight with Godzilla. That would be so awesome if that happened. There should be a crossover movie between the Cloverfield monster and Godzilla. Also those little baby monsters are sorta like in the Godzilla movie when Godzilla laid eggs and had babies even though Godzilla is a male. Also I know that when my brother watches this movie it sometimes gets him a little dizzy cause of all the movements with that guy and his camera. Now if I was in a situation like that where some monster invades New York or some other U.S. capitol city, I'd be running like heck and have proof with me so that all my friends and family can see what exactly happened. I also know that that monster is from outer space.",8,0,0,29 March 2016
Moana," Amazing. Simply amazing
","This is definitely a great Disney film. It's the best Hawaiian Disney film I've seen since Lilo and Stitch. It has an amazing story to it about a young princess named Moana who also becomes a hero by saving the world from total destruction with the help of the Polynesian demigod Maui. Of course we hear Maui's backstory of how he became a demigod. He was a mortal child who was abandoned by his parents and then the Polynesian gods made him for what he is now. Maui is an awesome character too and funny and Dwayne Johnson did an excellent performance of him. I also liked the chicken Hei Hei. He's funny too. The pig was cute too. One character that I found odd though was this giant crab named Tamatoa. He was very weird looking and a bit scary for children. Of course he's also voiced by Jemaine Clement from Flight of the Conchords who also voiced Nigel the cockatoo in Rio. That's a Non-Disney film by the way. He had a good song too. Of course all of the songs were brilliant in this including one of my favorites Opetaia Foa'i We Know the Way. I also loved Maui's song You're Welcome. Also Moana's grandmother and Moana's ancestors were just like Mufasa, cause they helped Moana remember who she was and then she went off to save the world, by confronting Te Ka who is really Te Fiti by returning her heart of pounamu to her which was stolen by Maui cause he wanted every mortal of the Pacific Islands to love him and she is restored to her old self and then everyone on Moana's island is allowed to sail the seas again as their ancestors did years ago. Great Disney film here and I so recommend this to anyone who has children.",10,3,15,26 November 2016
Suicide Squad," Must say what a disappointment for a movie
","Yeah I don't like to agitate anyone who liked this movie, but to be honest I agree with the critics on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie was a worthless piece of garbage. I mean the casting of this movie was off and it was sort of laughable too and the guy who played the Joker in this was nowhere near as good as Heath Ledger and Mark Hamill. Jared Leto is the worst Joker ever. He doesn't even deserve to play the Joker again in future DC films. I mean he can't even laugh as good as Heath Ledger or Mark Hamill and both Ledger and Hamill are legends. Jared Leto is nothing more then an amateur. Also the Joker doesn't need tattoos or bling in his teeth. Joker is fine with just his purple suit, green hair, white face and creepy evil smile or scars. Also Will Smith just sort of lost his way of acting and he was much better off being in Independence Day and Men in Black. I also like his role in the Pursuit of Happiness. Also Joker usually doesn't care for Harley Quinn that much, but it looked like he did care for her a lot in this. What's up with that? I also know in the game Batman Arkham City Joker got Harley pregnant. Also how the hell did Joker survive drowning in the ocean and that helicopter crash? There were no explanations for either of those things. I also still don't care about Ben Affleck being Batman and the only good part of this movie was that he was only in like 3 parts of it. Also the main villain in this movie reminded me of Gozer the Traveller from Ghostbusters and that scene where she was using her powers to take over the world was just like the scene in Ghostbusters where Gozer and her temple were on top of that building except that it was inside a building like in Ghostbusters 2 where Vigo was trying to come out of his painting but the Ghostbusters slimed him back into it. I mean this Enchantress person was exactly like Gozer from Ghostbusters and after she is defeated, that wife of Flag came out of her skin just like Dana and Louis came out the shells of Vintz Clortho and Zuul after the Ghostbusters defeat Gozer and Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. Also I understood most of the lines in this movie, but still there wasn't very good dialogue in this. This movie is so lame that it proves that Marvel will always be better then DC. The only good part about DC is the Dark Knight Trilogy and Christian Bale still makes a better Batman then Ben Affleck. This is film is worse then Batman vs Superman.",1,12,20,5 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Great Marvel movie
","This is definitely another great adaptation of a Marvel Comics hero. Doctor Strange is indeed the Sorcerer Supreme. Although I have never read any Doctor Strange comics, I've done some research on him and I'm still a Marvel fan. This movie also has very funny and amusing moments like when Strange's magic cape held that servant of Dormammu and when Doctor Strange used the Eye of Agamotto to get Dormammu stuck in a time loop to stop him from destroying the world as well as the multiverse and keep him in the Dark Dimension, along with his servants. Also the Ancient One was also an interesting character and in the comics the Ancient One was a man, but in this the Ancient One is a woman. We also get to see Thor during the ending credits of this film talking to Doctor Strange about them working together to protect Asgard from Loki. After all Asgard is also a dimension like the Mirror Dimension and the Dark Dimension. This movie is indeed filled with plenty of action and great special effects. 10 out of 10 for this.",10,1,6,20 November 2016
Watchmen," Watchmen The Worst Movie of All Time
","Nuts to this movie. Nuts to this movie in every way possible. This movie disgusts me. I never want to watch this again. The acting is terrible, the plot is terrible and nobody wants to see a blue guys junk through out a movie. Also you do not destroy half of New York in order to make world peace. That's not how it works! I can think of other superhero movies that are way better then this like Spider-Man movies with Toby Maguire except for Spider-Man 3, The Dark Knight Trilogy, The Avengers, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Also Star Wars is way better then this. I just want every single copy of this movie to be burned. This movie doesn't deserve very good critic reviews or reviews from the audience. This is just a piece of toilet paper waiting to be flushed down the toilet.",1,4,10,25 March 2016
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Best X-Men movie ever!
",This is now my absolute favorite of the X-Men movies. It has a great plot and Jennifer Lawrence is at her best as Mystique in this. This film also beats the crap out of X-Men Origins Wolverine. In this movie we see time travel as we see the future of when the Sentinels created by Bolivar Trask have taken over the world and the X-Men are the only ones who can stop them. Also the X-Men of the present have to travel back in time and prevent this future from happening. The X-Men fight through a lot and in the end the world is saved and Mystique is stopped from making the biggest mistake of her life. We also see Wolverine nearly die in this but it sure is a good thing he's OK in the end. We also see the full good in Magneto in this. After all Magneto is not truly evil. He just wants what's best for him in the world. This X-Men film has the best action and excitement and truly deserves a lot of credit. 10 out of 10 for this.,10,0,0,27 May 2016
Captain America: Civil War," Awesomeness here and way better then Batman vs Superman
","This is a really awesome superhero movie and definitely better then Batman vs Superman. The battle between 2 sides of Marvel heroes is a great take on what happened in the comics. Also Tom Holland makes a great Spider-Man in this and is way better then that idiot Tobey Maguire. Andrew Garfield was his own Spider-Man and there are many people out there who didn't like Andrew Garfield very much either. I say that Tom Holland makes the best Spider-Man yet and I can't wait to see him again in this new upcoming Spider-Man film next year in July. I also thought that since that this is based on the whole Marvel Civil War that Captain America was gonna die in this cause after the war had ended Captain America is assassinated by Crossbones who was hired by the Red Skull. In this Crossbones is a suicide bomber and when the Falcon tries to stop him from blowing up some people, the bomb destroys a building in Wakanda which is the home of the Black Panther. Then when the government tells Captain America and the other Avengers that people wanted them to work under government vision, Captain America sides with some of the heroes who oppose this while Iron Man sides with other Avengers of his own including Spider-Man who accept it. All this battle between Captain America and Iron Man was because of one man who became a terrorist after he lost his family during the battle against Ultron in Age of Ultron. Then Captain America and Iron Man officially went their separate ways and they both try to do good for the world again. Iron Man became the new leader of the original Avengers while Captain America owns his own team of superheroes. The Secret Avengers. All in all this movie kicks butt and more butt then Batman vs Superman. 10 out of 10.",10,1,7,21 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Great Harry Potter Spin off
","This was a very great spin off of the Harry Potter books. After all, Newt Scamander did not appear in the Harry Potter books, but was mentioned in the books. Also we saw Gellert Grindelwald, who was of course the inspiration of Tom Riddle, also known as the evil Lord Voldemort. He was also once Albus Dumbledores friend until his rise in dark power and then was imprisoned after trying to possess the Elder Wand and then was murder by Voldemort when he was looking for the wand. This movie also tells more about Grindelwald's past. He uses this boy named Credence Barebone who was also an Obscurial a powerful dark force that causes destruction and chaos. Its sister is called an Obscurus and the Obscurial was its host and Scamander kept it alive in a magic shield even after the Obscurial was destroyed by the counsel of wizards in New York City. Grindelwald was also arrested and then taken to Azkaban. Scamander also came to New York with a suitcase full of magical creatures that got loose and ran a muck around the city, but they weren't dangerous. Just mischievous. Newton Scamander managed to get them all back though and safe in his suitcase and then went back to England and after saying goodbye to Porpentina who of course becomes his wife in the future. Also Jacob Kowalski is also a likable character and opens up his own bakery after working in a can factory. Also he is the first muddle to be in love with a magic person. Yep this movie is really interesting and if you read the book that its based on, it will tell you all about the creatures in the Harry Potter universe.",9,15,29,19 November 2016
Independence Day," One of the best summer blockbusters ever
","This is definitely one of the best summer movies ever. It has a lot of action and plenty of aliens to fight. This is also the movie to be watching every 4th of July. Sure aliens may not exist, but this movie is worth watching. Also the operation room scene where they were operating on the alien until the alien came awake used to scare me as a kid. Also I laugh at that one guys raspy voice every time I hear it. Also the aliens in this movie are really cool. I used to have a toy of one those aliens. This movie will always be a part of my childhood and I still like it today. We'll also never forget the famous speech scene with Bill Pullman in this movie.",10,0,0,4 July 2016
Saving Private Ryan," A great American war movie here.
",This movie is indeed in honor of those who served in World War 2 who made sacrifice in order to save our world from tyranny. Every soldier of America makes an honorable sacrifice and we always remember their sacrifice. Throughout this movie we see Tom Hanks play as a captain as he leads these other soldiers through Europe against the dreaded Nazi army. Tom Hanks character makes a sacrifice and Matt Damon's character respects that and in the end the war is won thanks to the Allies. This is definitely a great film directed by the great Steven Spielberg and it deserves him an Oscar for best director. This film is also the 1998 Oscar winner for best picture. A great film to watch on Memorial Day and in honor of those that served our country.,10,1,4,30 May 2016
Frozen," As Good as The Lion King
","I love this film just as much as the Lion King. My girlfriend loves this movie too. I still know all the songs to this movie. One of my favorite characters in this is Olaf. He's cute and funny. I also like Elsa. She's awesome and so is her sister Anna. I also like Kristoff. He's cool too. I also strongly dislike Prince Hans the backstabbing, lying, scheming cockroach. It sure is a good thing that Anna got the chance to punch him right square in the nose at the end. My two favorite songs from this are Let It Go and In Summer. I can't wait till the sequel to this. This and the Lion King are my most favorite Disney movies.",10,2,8,30 March 2016
X-Men: The Last Stand," Kind of a disappointment for an X-Men movie
","This is the least popular of the X-Men trilogy. A lot of characters do die in this like Charles Xavier, Cyclops and Jean Grey aka the Phoenix. We also like it better when Jean Grey is with Cyclops instead of Wolverine cause what Wolverine and Jean Grey were having was an affair that Cyclops shouldn't know about. We also get to see some new villains in this like Multiple Man and Juggernaut. Now Juggernaut is not exactly how he appears in the comics in this movie cause Juggernaut is very big and is big as the Hulk. If there were a newer X-Men movie with him in it he would be a CGI character just like Hulk is in the Avengers. One part I found funny in this movie though is when Wolverine kicks this guy who has a healing factor like him in the crotch cause that was his only weakness. lol. Also Iceman is cool but still this isn't a very good movie. Also after the credits are over we find out that Charles Xavier has survived in another body. Still this movie doesn't make the cut. Of course I've seen worse then this.",4,0,1,27 May 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," Not as bad as critics think
",Now this X-Men movie is really good. I don't see what the big deal was when Rotten Tomatoes gave this film 47% critics views cause 74% of the audience liked it. Of course one flaw in this film is that Quicksilver is played by a different actor other then the one who played him in Avengers Age of Ultron. That's got to make some people in the audience mad. Still Quicksilver is a really cool character. I also think the plot is good cause the X-Men weren't just dealing with an all powerful mutant who has lived for thousands of years. They were dealing with a mutant of a god who thinks that destruction and chaos are the best solution to solving all of the worlds problems. With the help of Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto though they were able to destroy Apocalypse with a big blow. Another fact about Apocalypse is that after he dies is that he can regenerate in a new body and can live on again. I also see that some people expected a lot more in this. Still this movie is pretty good and isn't half bad.,8,7,14,27 May 2016
Logan," Neat but very sad as well
","This was a very well done last performance of Hugh Jackman here. It's sad though that this is his last X-Men movie. Also this is based on the comic book cause in the comic book Wolverine dies and a new Wolverine comes along named Wolverine X-23. I also did see that Wolverine had an evil twin in this. Also It's neat that she has a daughter in this too. It's also very sad to see the rest of the X-Men all dead cause of William Stryker's son. It's also sad to see Professor X die too and Wolverine in the end. But this movie at the end lets us all see a new team of X-Men rising which hopefully we'll see in new X-Men movies in the future. Wolverine may be dead and gone, but his legacy will live on and Hugh Jackman will always be remembered for his role in these movies. Also lets hope that Tom Hardy makes a decent replacement for him in new X-Men films.",7,1,5,6 March 2017
Avatar," Awesome movie here
","After hearing about this movie for almost 7 years, I've finally watched this and think its awesome. It has great visual effects, a fine cast and an amazing soundtrack. I also like this movie better then Titanic. I mean it has some sad scenes in it, but is much more powerful then Titanic. Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well. Awesome movie here and I so recommend this to other people who have not seen it. It also reminds me of Star Wars a little and I don't care what James Cameron thinks of The Force Awakens cause that's still my most favorite movie of all time.",10,3,4,8 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Great adaption of the original classic
","Beautiful. Simply beautiful. Emma Watson is fantastic as Belle in this and Dan Stevens makes a great Beast in this. Plus this is better then the original animated version cause it has some backstory to it. It shows why Prince Adam was selfish and unkind and it was because of his father. After Prince Adams mother had died, his father who was cruel and selfish treated him like dirt and raised him to be just like him. When Prince Adam was transformed into the Beast he blamed his father for his pain. Yep definitely a better backstory then the other one in the original animated version. It also shows Belle's backstory of when her mother had died. She had the plague and the doctors took infant Belle away so that she would be safe from the plagues harm. Her mother however didn't make it and went to Heaven. Also Gaston is the same as he is in the original, except he leaves Maurice to be eaten by wolves and shoots the Beast 3 times with a pistol instead of stabbing him with a dagger and shooting him with an arrow. He didn't even think about using his rifle in the original film. lol. It's also nice to see the enchantress throughout this film instead of the original cause in the original she is only shown at the beginning. It also has great brand new songs and the old ones from the original film, like Evermore, Be Our Guest, Gaston, and of course everyone's favorite the title song. Yep this indeed a beautiful masterpiece Disney has to offer. 10 out of 10.",10,8,23,24 March 2017
Pitch Perfect 2," Pretty funny here
",This a pretty good and funny movie here. It also makes a good tribute to a lot of really good songs. This is kind of like the movie version of Glee here. One funny part of this is that at the beginning of this when those singing group of girls perform in front of a huge audience including President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama and this fat girl is on this sash from the ceiling and she almost falls off the sash and her skirt is pulled down and her hole is revealed to the president and first lady and they did not like the look of it. lol. This movie also has a funny part where those girls and other singing groups are in a competition hosted by David Cross. Also for some reason the Green Bay Packers are in the competition too. lol. All those guys can think about though is football. lol. At the very end the girls go up against this singing German group and they win and become champions. Funny and clever singing movie here.,7,0,0,22 May 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Best King Kong movie ever
","This is the best King Kong film ever. Instead of taking a girl for his wife, being captured, taken to New York, put on Broadway, escaping Broadway, taking the girl again and causing destruction along the way, climbing the Empire State Building and getting shot by planes and falling off, King Kong is the king and protector of Skull Island. He is first encountered in 1944 and then over the years many planes have been trying to destroy him, only to awaken an even eviler monster then Kong. They're called Skull Crawlers or as they are what John C. Reily's character calls them and they look like that monster with fingers like snakes and spiders in his hair from the Nightmare Before Christmas. Nearly 30 years after the first encounter of Kong, a group of soldiers and scientists go and investigate the island for him, only to get a destructive surprise. Some of the soldiers are killed by Kong and only the general played by Samuel L. Jackson, the scientist played by John Goodman, the navigator played by Tom Hiddleston, the photographer and the rest of the soldiers survive. They soon encounter the Skull Crawlers as well as well as a village where the people are protected by a wall from the Skull Crawlers and they worshiped Kong, instead of making human sacrifices to him. They also learn about the Big Skull Crawler who is the master of them. The group also encounter what remained of Kong's parents and that Kong was the last of his kind. They also encounter huge bison's and pterodactals and the general swears revenge on Kong for killing some of his men and the group new he had gone stark raving mad and tried telling him that Kong is only trying to protect everyone on the island, but the general wouldn't listen. Then the photographer and the navigator find Kong and show him that they are no threat to him or the island. The general sets a trap for Kong and was about to finish him off with a bomb, until the navigator, the photographer and the soldier stop him and they see the big Skull Crawler coming towards them. The general stays still and was about to blow up Kong when he is crushed by Kong's hand. He then fights the Skull Crawler and the group helps him out and the Skull Crawler is vanquished and Kong's island is safe. The group then bids him farewell. Yep this is a whole lot better then the original King Kong, the 1976 remake and Peter Jackson's remake. We also get to see John C. Reily's character go home to his family after 30 years of being on the island. Also we learn after the ending credits that Godzilla is also living on Skull Island which means that we'll see a new King Kong vs Godzilla movie in the year 2020 and I am certain it will be better then the original American/Japanese version from 1962. Yep both King Kong and Godzilla are the best movie monsters ever.",10,19,38,12 March 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," Pretty good and cute film here
","This film is cute and funny here. It has really cute and fluffy characters in it and very good voice acting, especially from Albert Brooks who was that vulture that tried to eat Gidget, but was chained and then decided to help Gidget find Max and Duke who were held captive by that rabbit Snowball and all the rest of those lost and abandoned pets. Yep Max and Duke go on an adventure in order to get back to their owner after Duke finds out his old owner had died. Also the sausage scene had the song We Go Together from the movie Grease. which I didn't notice until now. Also Grease is still a classic. Anyway this story is a story about friendship and that the two dogs Max and Duke learn to get along after going on a long journey and this is nowhere similar to Toy Story. It's just a different story of friendship. 7 out of 10 for this. Enough said.",7,1,1,6 March 2017
Finding Dory," Brilliant sequel to Finding Nemo
","This is a terrific sequel to Finding Nemo. It actually tells about where Dory came from and that she actually does have short term memory loss. It also tells where she got that valuable life lesson from. She got the saying just keep swimming from her parents. You see Dory lived in the Marine Life Institute in California with her parents in a very huge aquarium with other fish and sea creatures. Her parents were very good with Dory and helping her cause of Dory's short term memory loss. Then one night Dory saw her mother crying cause her mother was worried that Dory would forget about her parents and Dory knew what would cheer her mother up. A purple shell. When she was about to get one near the drain pipe, the current from the drain pipe sucked her through and out into the open ocean and was separated from her parents. For many years Dory kept searching for her family until she ran into Marlin who was after Nemo in that boat. Then a year after the events of Finding Nemo Dory suddenly starts remembering her family and that she had to go to California to find them. She actually gets there and Marlin and Nemo go to try to get her out. Dory is put into quarantine where she meets this octopus named Hank who also wanted to get out. They both go through a lot of stuff such as getting touched by little human kids hands in a touching area until the reached where Dory lived before she got separated from her parents. When she realizes that it was her who got separated from her parents, she declared that it was her fault that she was separated from her parents, until she decided to go through the pipes. When she gets back into quarantine, she finds a tank of other blue tang fish and they tell her that her parents were gone meaning that they were dead. Feeling sad Dory just kept rolling through the kelp where she finds this area with shells. Then the most surprising thing came to her. It was her parents. For you see they made that area in case Dory would come back and she did. Dory was so happy to be with her parents again, until she remembered that Marlin and Nemo were still in quarantine and were being shipped in a truck to an aquarium in Cleveland, Ohio. With the help of Hank, Destiny the whale shark, and Bailey, Dory manages to get Marlin and Nemo out of the truck as well as all the other fish. Then they all go home back to the reef and played hide and seek. Then at the end, Dory goes to the drop off and enjoys the view and realizes that her parents taught her that she's very special and that she can do anything. Marlin thought so too. Brilliant story here. Pixar still has it. We get another brilliant performance from Ellen DeGeneres. We also get to see an octopus driving a truck which is cool and funny. lol. It also teaches us that people with disabilities are unique and can do anything.",10,4,22,26 June 2016
X-Men: First Class," Great X-Men movie here
","This is indeed a very great movie in the X-Men movie franchise. We get to see Magneto's tragic past and lots of other X-Men character origins in this too. The main villain in this who was of course a Nazi was the one that took everything from Magneto in that concentration camp in Poland. We also take a look at Professor Charles Xavier with hair in this and boy does he look good with hair. We also see him having a love interest in this which is also really cool. This movie contains a lot of action and it takes place during 1962 the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis when the Soviet Union was shipping nuclear missiles to Cuba until President John F. Kennedy ordered a navy blockade around Cuba to stop the missiles from being shipped in. The early 1960's is also the time when the X-Men were introduced along with the Hulk, Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man. This movie is truly amazing. Enough said.",9,0,1,27 May 2016
The Wolverine," Very entertaining movie of Wolverine here
",This is a really good movie of Wolverine here and definitely better then X-Men Origins Wolverine. This movie contains Wolverines own story and the main villain he has to fight is called the Silver Samurai. Now the Silver Samurai's main goal in this was to suck the healing factor out of Wolverine and make him young again. The Silver Samurai in the end was defeated though and Wolverine lived on. We also see Charles Xavier and Magneto at the end of this and they warn him of the deep threat of all humans and mutants that's coming in the future and that they need his help in on it. Very good movie here anyway and beats the crap out of X-Men origins Wolverine.,8,1,1,27 May 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Batman vs Superman
","This movie was OK. It wasn't that great. Most of the actors weren't even that good. Ben Affleck was OK as Batman, but I still like Christian Bale better. Also I was not expecting the death of Superman in this. Also Jessie Eisenberg was trying to imitate the Joker in this film. Also if you look in the Batcave you can see one of Batman's old suits with the Jokers writing on it. Another thing Lex Luthor is nothing like the Joker. Both are evil, but the Joker is more psychotic then Lex is. Also this movie didn't have a whole lot of emotion in it cause I already know about Superman's death in the comics. Still this was an OK movie but not that great. I don't even think I'll be watching this again any time soon.",5,1,4,25 March 2016
X2: X-Men United," A very good sequel to the first X-Men movie
",A very good sequel to the first X-Men movie here. It has more action and we get to find out more about Wolverine's origins and its all because of one man. William Stryker. He gave Logan the claws in his hands and turned him into an incredible fighting machine. Wolverine didn't like what Stryker did to him though and wanted to pay him back. At the very end though Stryker got what was coming to him when the flood from that dam drowned him. We also get to see the near death of Jean Grey after rescuing Cyclops and trying to stop the flooding from the dam. Hugh Jackman still does his best in this as he did in the first one.,8,0,0,27 May 2016
Lucy," Didn't make any sense
","Now I'm not saying anything really bad about this movie, but what was the point of this? Scarlett Johansson able to access through computers and then suddenly at the end she is in control of everything on the internet? Come on man. I mean I know this is an action sci-fi film but did this really have to be made? I mean who would want to make an action sci-fi film about Scarlett Johansson who plays Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe a freaking computer system? Scarlett shouldn't even be in these crappy sci-fi action films and just stick with being just Black Widow in the Marvel movies. Of course she was fantastic as Kaa in the CGI live-action version of the Jungle Book too. Seriously the director of this film needs to rethink this so that way he can sleep better at night.",3,1,4,31 March 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Best Movie of All Time
",This is best movie of all time. It is now my number one favorite movie of all time too. I will always be a huge Star Wars fan. One of my favorite new characters in this movie is Rey. She is awesome and I can't wait till she becomes a fully trained Jedi Knight after she's done training with Luke. I also really like BB-8. He's definitely part of the protocol droid trio now. Also rest in peace Han Solo. You were a truly great character. Sure is a good thing Rey kicked Kylo Ren's butt after that happened. Also Starkiller Base is bigger then the first and second Death Stars. I still wonder how Maz Kanata got a hold of Anakin's and Luke's lightsaber which was lost on Bespin after Vader cut off Luke's hand. Best movie ever. Enough said.,10,3,28,25 March 2016
Deadpool," Deadpool Really Awesome and Funny
","Deadpool is awesome and funny. This movie really puts maximum effort into being great. It was also funny when Deadpool tried to hit Colossus in every metal part of his body even his groin area. It also has a good love story in it. Deadpool has been awesome and funny since the year I was born. I have seen this movie twice and I like it. Another fact about Deadpool is that he has a healing factor and not only can he heal wounds he can regenerate his body parts too. It is possible that Wolverine could do that too, but I don't know. He can probably do that too. I have some Deadpool comics you know. Also he's been a lot of comics with Spider-Man. I can't wait till this movie comes out on Blu-ray.",10,5,14,25 March 2016
The Simpsons Movie," Funny animated film that should've been done in the 90's
","The Simpsons Movie is pretty funny, but I was thinking that Mr. Burns should've been the main villain in this instead of Russ Cargill and he was a cheap imitation of Hank Scorpio. What would've made this film even more funny is if the kept this deleted scene in where Homer ate all those sausages in that sausage truck and the truck driver drops him off and then checks on his sausages and saw that Homer ate them all and he screams out nooooooooooo! XD Also I do like that Green Day is in this movie and their a band that me and my brother really like. Now there should be a sequel to this, but unfortunately since the Simpsons only have 3 more years of being on the air, that's not going to happen. This is a funny movie anyway and I still like the classic Simpsons episodes better then the newer ones past season 11.",8,0,1,31 March 2016
