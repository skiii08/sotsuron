The Ring," Before seeing 'The Ring', read this...
","'The Ring' has acquired a reputation.  When you watch the commercials on T.V. with these teenagers wearing the 'cool & hip' brands of clothes, that have spiky hair, and that look like clones taken from the legion of main-stream teenagers of America saying: 'It's the scariest film I've ever seen!', you should know what 'The Ring' really is.  This is a remake of the Japanese film entitled 'Ringu', released in 1998, so if I counted well, four years ago.  And they do a remake.  But wait, the word 'remake' is not really appropriate here.  I would say Amercian version.  Americans (in general) are not very opened to difference...and let me tell you that, for those who've seen some, a Japanese film is totally different from an American film...the acting is completely another thing, as well as the directing.  Personally, I haven't seen 'Ringu', but I don't care.  I've seen 'The Ring', and that's enough, even though I would have preferred to see 'Ringu' instead.Here's a little overview of the movie: A woman investigates on the mysterious death of her niece, who apparently died after watching a video cassette.  She watches it, and it contains several successive images that don't really seem to have a meaning.  But, going further in her investigation, she discovers the origins of the tape and the meaning of every image.  But things get more complicated (and confused!) when she learns that she only has seven days to live after the viewing.  So, that gives her seven days to find the solution.  Original? A little.  Scary? Unfortunately, a little.  The only scary part of this film lasts about one minute and a half, and it's the viewing of the tape.  It's mysterious, creepy, and great.  THAT part was nice, and it somehow gave me shivers. But that's it.  Actually, that's the only creepy part because that's the only one where we truly disconnect from reality.  The rest of the film keeps a tone that I would describe as too sober for that kind of film.  I mean, there are surnatural events, but they are either very ordinary (in horror films) or flawed.  (Spoilers) Yes, seeing a woman going out of the television is not such a bad concept, it can be used cleverly and give a good scare, but, first, we saw it many times in other films (and I don't really consider that as a problem, because any idea can be used dozens of times and still be original, it all depends on the way it is delivered) and also, in 'The Ring', the directing is not good enough to make it scary. Another thing is the constant use of sound to make the audience jump out of their seats.  Okay, you can use it once, or twice, in very special occasions, and it will work...but in 'The Ring', they overuse it, I mean, they always put a loud sound effect for any action the character is doing, that's gratuitous.  If I hadn't seen it in a theater, it would not have been the same film.  Those who will see it at home better have an excellent surround sound system, because in the opposite case, they'll fall asleep. The key of a great and truly scary horror film is the atmosphere.  It has to be constantly creepy, to keep the audience in the mood, and that's what I meant by 'a sober tone'.  Yes, one minute you start going in the mood of the film, but the first thing you know is that, thirty seconds later, you come back to reality, and the audience's progress is ruined.  The ending tries to mix up reality and the horror, but it seems like the reality tone is stronger, and that ruins the whole potential of the film.  Those who want to see the creepiest film ever, and also one of the most brilliant films should definitely watch Stanley Kubrick's 'The Shining'.The directing by Gore Verbinski is ordinary, except, once again, for that minute and a half of bizarre and creepy images.  He seems to like giving us fake scares (like playing a creepy background music and showing the heroin getting near a door and opening it slowly, making us believe that something horrible is hidden behind it and that we're going to jump off our seats when we see what it is (and, just a little comment, these days it's not even the image itself that scares, it's the sudden loud sound) and simply not doing it, so he fools us, creating mild suspense and trying to avoid cliches).
The acting is average.  The little boy tries to scare us with his constant neutral facial expression, but fails.  Usually, a boy of that kind in an horror film is one of the scariest aspects of it, but in this case, he simply doesn't fit, and he simply has no importance.  He's not quite Danny Torrance (played by Danny Lloyd, in 'The Shining'), let me tell you that. The other actors are okay, there is not much to mention about them.
The plot is needlessly complex.  It tries to be complicated and everything, and in the end you realize it cannot explain itself.  Somebody explain to me the nosebleeds, why the boy can talk to the girl from the tape, the hose jumping off the boat...they put lots of weird things, explain some of them, and try to make us forget the other ones they can't explain. For a good plot in an 'horror' film, see Bill Paxton's 'Frailty', it is a hundred times better, and it really works!  It unfortunately doesn't seem to be the case for 'The Ring'.I've read the discussion forums for this film on IMDb.  One of them was 'The Ring is the scariest film of the last twenty years'.  That's ridiculous.  Those who say that have truly been hypnotized by Hollywood. 'The Ring' happens to be a very overrated film that a generation of ignorants will find truly scary because they haven't seen anything else and have no cinematic culture...someone that says 'The Ring' is the scariest film doesn't know anything about foreign or underground films...they only watch Hollywood blockbuster crap that is to cinema what McDonald's is to food...Last year, there's been a much scarier movie than that, and it IS a Hollywood film, I'm talking about 'Frailty', from Bill Paxton...excellent film.  Anyone remembers 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' from Coppola?  That was beautiful and creepy...that was not junk...'Interview With The Vampire', from Neil Jordan, anyone?  Yes, it seems that these years (and I mean from 1996 to today) horror films have taken an atrocious turn into the category of SUSPENSE movies, which are a totally different thing....Wes Craven's Scream (an awful film, by the way) is a SUSPENSE, not an horror film! And, again, they had to ruin good things even worse, so they made awful suspense films with monsters or ghosts in them, and they wrapped it with leading actors and actresses with bigger chests than talent, and they've got a Box Office success that every ignorant North-American will find scary...congratulations...Anyone who thinks he or she loves horror movies has to watch 'The Shining'...if you don't find it scary, then you don't know what a REAL horror movie is.  Before I see 'The Ring' again, it will see mine, if you know what I mean.Overall, it is a very ordinary thriller, with some suspense, brief horror scenes, and it is a flawed horror film.  At least it really tried to be a horror film, and ruined itself.  It is average, deceiving in the thrill factor, but it still has better entertainment value than the majority of today's horror flicks from Hollywood...5/10",Null,0,0,30 November 2002
Batman Returns," It was wonderful...
","Batman Returns was very good. The backgrounds made an nice-looking atmosphere going perfectly with the story and the different moments in the film. The story was basicly simple, but became better when Penguin and Catwoman met each other to ally up against Batman. There are things I did'nt understand, like when Celina Kael dies and cats bite her and then she gets back to life and has a weird cat influence. But this phenomenon was there to add some mystery to this dark movie. Batman is again fighting the bad guys, and living as Bruce Wayne, the nice billionaire. But there is one detail that everyone should forget to say the movie was at least a bit intelligent;forget that people don't recognize his voice when he has his Batman costume! But still this film was a lot of fun. This is a superhero movie, like the first Batman (not the other two things they called Batman Forever and Batman and Robin!!!!), these were the best superheroes movies of these years! But when you think about it, Batman is not really a superhero;he's just a man wearing a cape and a mask and who has a car named The Batmobile and a weird gun! BUT STILL THIS FILM, LIKE THE OTHER BATMAN WAS A LOT OF FUN AND HAD A TIM BURTON'S DARK ATMOSPHERE!!!I give it 81%.",10,1,2,23 January 2000
Ed Wood," Tim Burton's best
","Ed Wood, was Tim Burton's best for sure. I enjoyed it from the beginning, which is an introduction like they made in cheap scary movies of these years to the great ending where they tell us everything that happened to the characters after the Plan 9 From Outer Space Premiere. it was funny and touching and I'll never see Edward D. Wood Jr. the same way. He was not stupid at all, he simply had no talent. He was nice and positive and happy most of the time, and he enjoyed his movies, he really thought his films were great. He is just the opposite of Orson Welles, who made Citizen Kane, the best American film. Ed Wood made the worst. Martin Landau was EXCELLENT in the role of Bela Lugosi, and his arms were disgusting (because of all the stitches he had) and he won the oscar for best supporting actor, but I thought Johnny Depp gave an AWESOME performance too. It represents the story of Edward D. Wood Jr. the best way we could imagine. The fact that the film was in black and white was another good point too...we were more in the atmosphere of old films. It was funny, smart, and it was not laughing at anyone, even with the main character (the worst director of all time) and that was a good surprise. The kind of film you have to watch over and over again...don't rent it, BUY IT. It is great! Not the best film I've seen, but quite a good piece of entertainment. I was surprised to see Bill Murray in this, who was in my mind a bad actor...but I realized he played in good films and in this one he did a very good job. When I'll see Ed Wood films, I'll remember how he was feeling and how he liked them, and I'm sure I'm gonna like them too, if I watch them with this idea in my head. Watch it at all costs...I didn't find it in the three first videos I went to, but I finally found it and enjoyed it. I give it 87%.",Null,0,0,24 April 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Kubrick's comedy:What a hit!!!
","Dr.Strangelove or: How I Stopped Worrying and Love The Bomb was excellent. With Peter Sellers playing many roles, the acting was great and with Stanley Kubrick as the director, the film was extremely good. It was funny and intelligent, the kind of comedy that you can watch everyday. What else could I say? I give it 90%.",10,1,1,19 March 2000
The Beach," Like Funky A said, Boyle's most commercial movie, but still good...
","Danny Boyle brought us the dark and macabre Shallow Garve, which was excellent and Trainspotting, which was a very funny and stylish film. I have to say that Ewan McGregor was missing in this one....maybe they thought the role would be more appropriate for a beautiful actor, and it's too bad they chose one with such a limited talent: Leonardo DiCaprio. Really, I doubt seeing Ewan McGregor in bening suit would attract more girls than seeing Leo. That is unfortunately another proof that this movie has a commercial goal. And what about Virginie Ledoyen, who never seemed to feel anything...right, she is, I think, the most beautiful superstar in the world...but is she a good actress? Well...she doesn't deliver a very amazing performance...but, the rest of the cast wasn't bad...there were some nice and innovative scenes, like when Richard imagines that his life is like a video game...I enjoyed the film, the atmosphere of freedom but still, I didn't feel I had just watched an important film after watching the beach...but still, I think it deserves more than the poor IMDb user's average of 5.8...it's an under-estimated film....I liked it, not as much as Shallow Grave or Trainspotting ( and by the way my dear friend Funky A, I haven't seen A Life Less Ordinary, to which you made an excellent critic, so other users that are reading this review, I think you should read Funky A's reviews if you have a serious interest in films) but I think it should get 79%, and that's of course what I give to The Beach.",Null,0,0,12 August 2000
Alien," A classic
","Alien is a masterpiece...and one of Ridley Scott's best films, along with Thelma And Louise, Blade Runner, and others (but not Gladiator!!!)...This is not only a suspenseful film, it's also an esthetically perfect movie.  The dark planet where they find the eggs, the spaceship with incredible lighting effects, all this atmosphere makes the film one of the scariest you'll ever see.  The sound is also perfect, with a calm ambiance, that suddenly breaks, but stays in a very special mood.  The acting is very good, especially from Sigourney Weaver and Ian Holm.  It's one of those 'It started it all' movies...many many many cheap and stupid rip-offs were made...the storyline is so simple, but they made such a beautiful film with it.  And in despise of what many people say, 'Aliens' isn't better than 'Alien', it's just about the action factor...but the beauty of the first one is only seen in the first one...The storyline is the following: Some people on a spaceship capture a creature on a strange planet, and it evolves, and starts killing the passengers...conventional, you'll say?  Maybe, but being conventional can be very good, it depends on the what you do with your storyline...let's take the example of 'Sleepy Hollow' from director Tim Burton, which has a very simple story, but the images are so nice and perfect, and dark that you can enjoy a lot more the movie than you would enjoy a very complex movie...'Alien' is for people who can recognize good directing, and a good atmosphere, otherwise, if you prefer action, see 'Aliens' or 'Alien:Resurrection'.  But this is the first and the best of the Alien series...and I'd say my second favorite Science-Fiction movie, after 2001:A Space Odyssey...Extraordinary film! 10/10",10,0,1,2 May 2001
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick is a GOD!!!
","Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie ever. Full Metal Jacket shows us how army can destroy people's minds. It starts in a military base where men are trained to become marines for the Viet-Nam war. One man, who is a bit fat, is hated by the colonel, who beats him and who discovers a donut in his box. He makes the others hate the guy and one night, the others (including Joker, his friend)beat him up. He is sad and then decides to get better in the marine training...and it works, but he then kills the colonel and himself...Then they go to the war and many things happen...this is a psychological film, more human than The Thin Red Line, and more dramatic than Saving Private Ryan. The actors were excellent too, but it seemed like the film was incomplete. Kubrick is the master, a god!!! See this film at all costs! I give it 89%.",Null,1,1,7 February 2000
Cast Away," Good film, pathetic ending.
","Cast Away is good, that's true. I knew exactly what it would be all about even before seeing it. But I still had fun. And the plane crash is awesome...freaky to death. The moments spent on the island were purely great, but the rest suffered of the Spielberg-like pathetic ending. Tom Hanks played his usual role, but who cares? He plays it well. Maybe a change wouldn't be so bad...Anyways, his character was pretty intelligent and he reacted just like I would have reacted...except for the swear words...he didn't even say one F-word. And Zemeckis really convinced me that Tom Hanks' Volley ball was his friend...I even felt stupid after the movie because of that. The backgrounds made me feel like I was in paradise. And this film is an exception to his genre, and it's a very good thing; He was always alone on his island, there were no stupid cannibal tribes or anything. It's like Robinson Crusoe, but with its own advantages, and its own weak points. This is surely a good movie, and I'm sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations, because it's exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their 'Right to Censorship' mind. Most of it was a good moment, but the other parts suffered of the pathetic syndrome. And, by the way, this is not a very touching movie, it won't make you cry or anything, but it's very agreeable to watch. And you can also interpret it as a critic to materialism. Good film. 7/10",Null,0,0,3 January 2001
The Shining," A SIMPLE MASTERPIECE!!!!!
","The Shining is simply the most horrifying film I've seen in my whole life. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance, a writer who goes in a hotel with his family(his wife and his son)to be far from the city and to don't get his concentration broken every five seconds. But a long time ago, another caretaker killed his wife and his two daughters with an ax. The whole family already has mental disorder problems(the son, Danny, has an imaginary friend, Tony which is his second personality). The boy sees weird things in the hotel; the two girls that got killed long ago by their father are talking to him. Jack becomes more and more ''psycho'' day after day and finally wants to kill his family... There are lots of details in The Shining that you don't understand the first 5 times you watch it...that's why I bought it. And especially a weird ''time warp''which makes you ask yourself;do the characters have been in the Hotel before? I did not already find the answer. In this film, based on the novel by Stephen King, the horror is intelligent and is not based on blood and guts, Kubrick knew our fears, and he put them together. He is a genius. Jack Nicholson plays his character like a pro(he is!!!) and Danny Lloyd says REDRUM with a very scary voice. By the way, when I realized that REDRUM was MURDER, I told myself that I had a lot more to understand about this masterpiece. Stephen King written the story of Sometimes They Come Back, which is about zombies, which I call a STUPID AND SIMPLE HORROR SUBJECT, the opposite of The Shining's subject. He also written the story of The Green Mile and Shawshank Redemption, two excellent movies that are not scary at all. He is definitely an excellent writer. Stanley Kubrick, well, it's Stanley Kubrick. He is the director who made some excellent movies, masterpiece after masterpiece. He takes his time to put us in the most sensational atmosphere possible, depending on the kind of movie. BUT NOW HE IS DEAD!!!AND IT MEANS THAT HE WILL NEVER MAKE ANOTHER MASTERPIECE...AND THAT MAKES ME SAD...But The Shining is still here, and I'll never forget it! I give it 98%(and maybe I am not generous enough....)",10,0,1,16 January 2000
The Patriot," This is also the title of a Steven Seagal movie...
","Okay, The Patriot with Mel Gibson is better than The Patriot with Steven Seagal. But it is still pretty conventional. This film doesn't bring anything new and there is such a huge barrier between the good and bad guys. But, what is funny is how Mel Gibson is an animal one day, and a nice guy the next day. The special effects are pretty good, but this is a Blockbuster...so they had a big budget, and they did the same mistake than the awful Godzilla and the very boring Independence Day (and by the way, it's the same director in this one). This is a part of history that wants itself to be shown on a golden plate, but the bad quality of the script and directing make the plate cheaper. I compare this film to Braveheart a lot, and I realize how good Braveheart was, and how deceiving The Patriot is. It's the same kind of  situation that brings the hero to react and create an army to destroy the bad guys and get back their freedom. Some scenes try to be pathetic, but Mel Gibson isn't convincing at all. The whole film seems like a modern reproduction of the old times because of the costumes that seem too clean, the backgrounds that don't put the viewer in a mood, etc. It all looks fake and superficial. Made in USA, as they say, and proud of it. 5/10",Null,0,1,23 December 2000
Resident Evil," Zombie film: Hollywood Version
","'Resident Evil' was, originally a series of really enjoyable video games. With a dark, creepy atmosphere that could make you jump out of your seat, it created a world in which you could easily go into.  It also had the reputation of being a very graphic and gory game.  Another great element of the games was the plot; you had to resolve many puzzles, and your intelligence was required to play.    The same things are not all true in 'Resident Evil', the film. 
  'Resident Evil' tells the story of a woman who had been rescued from a virus infested research center.  She awakens later on, she has forgotten everything.  After that, a military team takes her and brings her back in the research facility, when the effects of the virus are no longer contagious.  They find that the release of the deadly virus was a conspiracy.  But there are many problems on their way; some almost invincible zombies, a main system (which takes the aspect of a little girl) that wants to kill every intruder, and a security system that turns against them.    In the case of 'Resident Evil', it's not the movie itself that is so bad, it's all those little things that are messed up, without ruining completely the quality of the movie.  If you've seen 'Deep Blue Sea' and liked it, then you'll love Resident Evil.  As much as 'Deep Blue Sea' was a very simple and common model of what a suspense movie turns out to be in Hollywood, 'Resident Evil' is another clone of that model.  What I mean by that is the presence of the similar elements, which mostly are: A good-looking girl, a bunch of men that get killed one by one, a spectacular enemy, some high-tech facilities and equipment, a very simple scenario, some violence (not graphic enough to gross out the average teenager, which is 80% of their target audience, but not mild enough to be rated PG-13), and some cool looking action sequences.  It's a formula that works many times, and they chose it for a movie that promised so much, but did not deliver what the real 'Resident Evil' fans like.  A movie that could have been so much more...I could easily criticize the plot, or the actors, but you know how it is, and we all know how it is. It's just normal, common, average...it has nothing special...it is an excuse to make a movie.  I'll still have to admit that Milla Jovovich is not only a beautiful woman, but she's also a pretty good actress.  Even though her role in 'Resident Evil' did not require a lot of talent, she's still able, sometimes, to make us share the shivers she plays on the screen. 
  The points where I would focus a little more are two very important elements in the 'Resident Evil' video games.  Like I said before, originally, these games were moody and gory.  Two major deceptions here. The gore...ARGH!  I just can't take it, it's made by computer!  This is a message to all directors: If you want to put any gore in your films, do it the old fashioned way.  Digital blood looks fake, digital monsters look fake...Even with some very cheap gore/creature effects, you can do a better job than the one they did in 'Resident Evil'...the same thing is true in Blade...Every single mutilation in 'Resident Evil' was made in CGI, and every single one of them really looks bad.  (Spoilers) There's a part where more than half a dozen soldiers are cut in pieces by lasers (and it really deceived me to see that three quarters of the human characters die in two minutes...human characters were the only hope of seeing a gore scene in this film, because the zombies in this film have coagulated blood, which is, for sure, realistic and intelligent, but absolutely not satisfying for the gore fans) and some heads are cut off, some bodies are cut in cubes.  But every darn death looks so fake!  Even in the excellent low-budget Canadian movie 'Cube', the effect with the guy that gets sliced into dices is really, really, really, really, a thousand times better than all of 'Resident Evil''s reunited gore moments.  I'm sick of CGI gore...and all CGI made movies...this is removing all the human aspects of movies...people are amazed to see things that were made with computers and almost look real...Yeah, they almost look real, but if they were done like before, they would look even more real!  Well, what is the point of being impressed with things that could be a lot more simple and look better if they were done like before...It's not because technology exists that films should overuse it...Technology is a tool, and many film makers don't understand it. 
  The other aspect, the mood, is not delivered the same way...it's more like a futuristic atmosphere, with a certain lack of terror, a very 'Blockbuster' atmosphere, with nothing really eerie.  The music is not bad, but it certainly is not as creepy as the one in the games.  The zombies are not scary at all, and the other 'creatures' are plain laughable. 
  They kept some elements from the games, and that's a good thing.  The city is still 'Raccoon City', the train really is identical to the one in the game of 'Resident Evil 2', (Spoilers) the city in the end really seems to be an image taken from the game, it's the Umbrella Corporation, etc.  But, talking about that ending, which is actually pretty good, I would have seen the whole movie setting in the Raccoon City streets, like we do in the beginning of 'Resident Evil 2' (the game).       Overall, I'd say that 'Resident Evil' really is a disappointment, especially if you were a big fan of the games, but for those who haven't heard of the games and saw the movie and thought it was good, you should definitely check these games out!  'Resident Evil', the movie, is a very common piece of entertainment, that, without being bad, simply offers some acceptable entertainment, some mild thrills, and an easy and agreeable night at the theater.  It really is nothing impressive, but it's very ordinary recipe of Hollywood thriller that puts itself under a name that has acquired reputation with the years.  Not that bad, but nothing great either.

Lawrence of Arabia," Surely one of the best films that exist...
","Lawrence of Arabia was surely one of the best films that exist and one of the best I've seen. It is pretty long, but you can't fall asleep watching this. It looks like Braveheart in many ways and it's even better. The acting of Peter O'Toole was unbelievable and the other actors did an excellent job too. The backgrounds looked good and there were so much good messages and influences in this film. It is considered as an important film in the history of movies...and it is!!! The whole thing is simply stunning, brilliant!!! I think everybody should spend a couple of hours of his life to watch it. If you liked Braveheart, The Ten Commandments, it is for you.Most people who have a real interest in films have watched it, but if you want to introduce yourself to great cinema, maybe you should start with this...or with the AWESOME The Shining.

Moulin Rouge!," Shallow
","« Moulin Rouge! » is, unlike many main stream and commercial movie lovers might have told you, a waste of time.  With directing that looks more like what you would see in a stupid MTV video, those who've seen the awful video for the main song of this film (sung by the biggest amount of prostitutes put under the title of singers I've seen reunited together!), « Moulin Rouge! » doesn't bring anything new, except maybe another Blockbuster hit that will please to average North American families and make millions at the Box-Office...  How amazingRight, the film itself is a musical that, by the way, features lots of remakes of very popular and modern songs, and doesn't deliver at all any other feeling or atmosphere you will see in masterpieces such as « Singin' In The Rain », which is a great musical.  I know it is not happening in the same period of time, and it wasn't made in the same period of time, but the really disgusting aspect of it that really upsets me, especially when I think about all the nominations it got for Oscars (these guys are getting even harder to trust every year!) is the really shallow display of everything in this film.  The film itself simply looks like a TV commercial that tries to sell you how beautiful the costumes are, how happy the characters are, how sad someone's death is, how much knowledge they have (Wow! They even know what Absinthe is!  These guys have culture, have they?UH?  And I can prove that this is not a typical American film, yes I can prove it, because it has references to foreign cultures and some characters have weird accents that sound less natural than Arnie's American accent in Commando!) and they really try hard to create an atmospherebut fail big time!  There is nothing magic in all this mess, except maybe for this hypnotized, shallow generation of MTV fans that know absolutely nothing about cinema and think they have cinematic culture because they saw 'Titanic'.  (Spoilers coming up) 	Nicole Kidman's death in the film is truly one of the least sad ones I've ever seen, and if someone cried for this, they should definitely not see a REALLY emotional film.  Kidman's character was not likeable at all, and I'd say that in « Moulin Rouge! », not unlike many other of her films, Kidman's performance is like a fashion showshe just wants all the attention on the screen, she wants to be the showisn't thathumshallow?  Indeed.  Her character is a big cliche and is explicitly unidimensional.  Ewan MacGregor is good, he's Ewan MacGergor after all, and he's a great actor and he has the most interesting role in this movie.  John Leguizamo's not bad either. But, again, the characters are pretty slightly developed, and the director spent more time showing his « beautiful » plastic dresses and costumes and playing boring songs and putting them in boring music video-like sequences rather than doing essential things for his film.  	An overall pretty empty film, with nothing but average, shallow entertainment that is the equivalent of two hours of MTV videos with better actingNot very surprising it got nominations for Oscars, because these days only good taste is accepted and typical American films (very formulatic in many cases!) are privileged.  So, I know I may have been a little severe with this film, but it really is the definition of the word  « SHALLOW »maybe that's why this word appeared so many times in my review.  If you spend your days watching MTV, and if you cry when you watch teen movies, this might be for youBut if you're looking for something that goes deeper than skin, plastic, and absolutely not touching love stories, you'll be deceived.  This is a better version of « Glitter » with better intentions (OUCH! That's a big punch in Mariah's face!) and a setting in the past.  Oh yeah, and Ewan MacGregor and John Leguizamo's performances are good (this time I won't compare it to « Glitter », because there is truly a difference for this point.and again, your side's not the bright one, Mariahyou don't « glitter » that much, you know), but don't save this film.  Watch « Singin' In The Rain » insteadthat is a great musical.  I give « Moulin Rouge! » 4/10.",Null,1,3,4 November 2002
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Excellent homage...worth all the wait
","It's funny to learn Tarantino's earlier life (in a video store, for example) when we consider that this man did one of AFI's top 100 movies, Pulp Fiction, somehow, I think it does give great hope to young film makers that dream of having their passion as their job.  His story is interesting, nonetheless, if you learn how he got Reservoir Dogs done and then Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown, and then...Kill Bill.Tarantino does something very special here...he does everything a film maker could ever dream of: a movie for himself, a movie he does cherish as much as some people will do in a couple of years, when Kill Bill is going to be a cult classic.  A movie in which he pays homage to Oriental cinema, while Lucio Fulci fans will be totally pleased to see guts being spilled and people being sliced and diced in very bloody fashion.  Also, Tarantino does punctuate the film with his own style, which has become a landmark in American cinema.  Here we get many things that differentiate Kill Bill from an conventional institutional film; the chronology, which is, as usual in a Tarantino movie, like a puzzle in which all the short stories finally fit well together, there is also the very appreciated presence of an amazing anime sequence in the middle of the film, the fact that some scenes are in black and white, and not always to symbolize flashbacks (maybe in the case of Kill Bill Vol.1 it was only to avoid an NC-17 rating though, but I'll talk about that later), and, to top it all, we got way too much blood and gore for a typical American film, which Kill Bill Vol.1 definitely isn't.
Now, it really is evident that Tarantino did watch many Japanese movies. The animated part in his film is just as great and has the same crazily Japanese feel to it than 'Akira', for example.  The animation is done quite beautifully, much better than any manga, but still keeps a very Oriental aspect.  Also, the combat scenes, especially at the end, keep the spirit and slow pace of classic Japanese cinema (think of Kurosawa or Kobayashi). Yeah, aside from all that crazy gore and limbs that fly all over the room, the honour-oriented aspect of the sword fights and the choregraphy just help to make of Kill Bill Vol.1 a true homage to Samurai films.  Yes, it is an American film, yes, that's also something you'll feel while watching it, but it is not common at all, and it really makes an interesting mix of genres which I think only the Tarantino blender could put back together to obtain something very interesting.  Yes, it did bother me a little at first to see that the fight against the 88 men in the restaurant was suddenly turning to black and white.  Yes, the violence impact was mostly gone because of that, but really, with the grainy picture and the sound changing too, for a moment, I really thought I was watching a better version of 'Shogun Assassin' with better camera angles and much, much more blood.  And, then, right after that comes a fight which is shown only in shadowgraph...wonderful.Kill Bill Vol.1 (and probably the whole film) does not really suffer from its very thin storyline, which is stylistically exploited to its maximum. Yes, it's just a plain story of revenge, but remember that Tarantino is behind it.  And, by the way, another movie last year had pretty much the same storyline and was considered by many (which include myself) as an excellent film; 'Gangs of New York'.  These two films exploit one of the oldest subgenres ever: the revenge flick.  Scorsese's film had an amazingly delivered historical background to it, but Tarantino's has something hard to describe.  One thing is sure, though, substance is not the main attraction here.  But who cares?  This film expresses the fundamental joys of cinema from someone who truly had fun making his baby.  And it does make a great homage to Oriental movies , and it SURE delivers lots of entertainment.
Tarantino's directing is, as always, pretty good, while improvement has been made here; his three previous films were shot like (as he said himself) 'good old boring television' but punctuated with some great shots and a pretty interesting knowledge in directing.  But in Kill Bill Vol.1, Tarantino keeps his good old habits, but adds some new things to his direction.  The black and white scenes are part of that, as well as some very dynamical camera procedures.  I would say Kill Bill Vol.1, for right now (because I haven't seen Vol.2!) is not Tarantino's best film.  But for the direction, it's the most original, and probably the best, though his style did fit better in his other movies.The actors are all great.  Uma Thurman is pretty good as the protagonist, but David Carradine, which we don't really see in the first volume, was frightening in his parts.  Also, Lucy Liu does a great job as O-Ren Ishi, a professional assassin with a very dark past.  All the others are very good too.The soundtrack is brilliant, really.  That's a Tarantino trademark too. The music is just perfect for the film, bringing incredible energy to the colourful and beautiful images which are delivered in a splendid and versatile photography.  Tarantino uses different colour textures and image grain for the different scenes, as well as the sound.  Yes, those things are apparent, which is something many people might dislike, but trust me, it does add a lot to the style and and value of this film.So, overall, as a first volume, this was good, very good. Sure, it is not as good as 'Reservoir Dogs' or 'Pulp Fiction', but it does have bite, and a lot of it. And, to be honest, I'll be impatiently waiting for the second volume to be released.8.5/10",Null,0,0,11 October 2003
A Clockwork Orange," One of the most controversial films of all time...but one of the best.
","Clockwork Orange is a perfect film in many ways. I guess it has the best overall a movie can have. It is about 4 guys who have three hobbies: beating up people, raping girls and listening to Betowen's music. This gang has a leader, played by Malcolm MacDowell, who goes to prison after the rape and murder of an old millionnaire's wife. But he is used as a ''laboratory rat''. Scientists make weird experiments on him. The goal of these experiments is to stop Malcolm MasDowell's addiction to violence, rape, coarse language and Betowen's music. But when MacDowell realizes that he gets sick when he sees violence or when he listens to Betowen's music, he knows he can easily get in deep trouble. And people who saw him on the newspapers for the rape and murder of the young girl remember him and know his new handicap. They beat him up, and he has to hide if he doesn't want to get killed. The closest place to hide is the millionnaire's house, where he killed the millionnaire's wife. This film is different from other movies about violence. It shows violence in an almost funny way, and the meaning of it is that there would be no world if there was no violence, we simply don't have to abuse...The satire is even bigger in this film than the huge one in Dr.Strangelove. I don't know if this is Kubrick's best, but it is surely a movie to remember and to put in my favorites' list. I give it 93%.",Null,0,0,19 March 2000
Reservoir Dogs," A very strong gangster film...
","Reservoir Dogs is Tarantino's best, in my opinion, even though I know many people will contest this affirmation...Pulp Fiction was pretentious, had a style that looked a little too 'wannabe', and that didn't fit with that kind of story.  But Reservoir Dogs is different.  With all its awesome acting, especially from Harvey Keitel, its excellent twists and non conventional situations, it's the best film of its kind.  It's boosted with testosterone, but it also laughs at itself, just to show how badly some supposedly professionals can work.  No humor, no jokes in this film, it's just the troubling situations some characters confront that will make you laugh.  And that's perfect, because the humor in Pulp Fiction was there to seem cool. The scenario is pretty well written, even though the use of the F-word is excessive...that story reminds me some Shakespeare texts, without all the pathetic and sad perspective.  (Spoilers warning) There's also that scene, where Mr.Blue cuts off the cop's ear...this is a classic in violent cinema (is this a good or bad thing?!?!) because of its intensity, and of course, realism.  The whole thing is very violent, and I don't know how a man that got shot once in the torso can bleed over half of a garage's floor...the awesome ending is also one of the most brutal and weird ones you can see. The story is about a group of robbers who plan a robbery at a jewelry, and that fail it...but the problem is that the cops were already in front of the store even before the robbery...so the criminals suspect one of them for being a cop.  And the relationships between the several characters seperate them in two different groups, confronting each other in the end.  And when you realize that the whole film was about seeing these guys fail, and kill each other to arrive at the conclusion that everyone is dead, the only thing you can do is laugh out loud...because it is funny, in some way.  And the Coconut song won't help you stop laughing, because it brings an ironic and satiric aspect to it.  The tagline used for 'Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels' which is 'A DISGRACE TO ALL CRIMINALS' is more compatible with this one...and 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a pretty good movie too. Overall, great acting, interesting and surprising story twists, fine directing, and a very good movie. 9/10",10,0,1,18 February 2001
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," Very uncommon approach to criticize fascism
","Pier Paolo Pasolini is a man that I consider as a fascinating director. 'Salò: The 120 Days of Sodom' (Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma) was his last film.  His most noticeable works include 'Porcile' and 'The Gospel According To St.Matthew.  Well, I would like to be clearer on this point, and I'll say that the word 'noticeable' here is a synonym of 'best'.  On the other hand, though, I would say that Salò is truly his most talked-about film, if you thought I meant that by noticed.  The film is good, but I really preferred the two mentionned above, artistically and intellectually speaking.  But Salò has its qualities, even though some of us might consider them as flaws.Salò is based on the Marquis de Sade's novel, entitled 'Les 120 journees de Sodome'.  The book (of course, it was written way before the fascist period in Italy!) doesn't talk about fascism, and the main common point between the film and the book is the main concept.  The film shows the horrors inflicted to a bunch of young and beautiful people that were selected by four sadistic (what a funny use of the word!) fascists that are only willing to quench their own brutal sexual and violent thirsts.  They are taken to a villa where the are submitted to the worst humiliations, which include being raped whenever the four masters feel the desire to have sex, eating feces, and later on being brutally tortured and killed.
This film is recognized for being one of the sickest of all times, one of the most disgusting also.  Well, the 'shocking content' mostly consists of constant nudity of young adults, many rapes, excrement-eating, scalping, tongue mutilation, and eye gouging.  There are also pretty nasty stories told by a lady whose role in the villa is to tell sick stories that have for goal to turn on the four masters.  I saw movies that were more disgusting than that, sincerely.  The context and the cruelty surrounding many acts of violence and humiliation in this film are probably the main reason why it shocked so many people.  The sexuality is never explicit (in the way that you never see a penetration graphically), the killings are pretty well done (the scalping especially) but there are very few of them and they are brief. I would say that 'Caligula' is way more graphic and shocking than 'Salò' (but less effective though).Pasolini's directing is beautiful.  He made a mistake in one scene, changing the angle of the camera of less than 30 degrees between two shots. Except for that, he's fascinating...he's obsessed with showing symmetrical images...all the time.  This technique somehow communicates the 'discipline' and the supposedly high 'straightness' of the fascists pretended to have. Also, the camera often has a pretty wide vision, and we don't often really get close to any character.  With such coldness, Pasolini was criticized a lot.  People didn't know if it was really a statement against fascism or just a good reason to show horrible things...Personnally, knowing a couple of things about Pasolini's life, I didn't doubt one moment about his intentions.  Yes, he had socialist tendencies, yes, he was a homosexual (which fascists hated) and yes, he was against fascism, and it is clear when you see the film.  People who only watch American films and are used to explicit messages in films will not understand that, but this film plundges us into cruelty we could have really compared to the nazis', and that's how it delivers its message.  Maybe too subtle for some, but sometimes, I think it's better this way...just like in most American movies...an example: American History X talks about racism...'Racism is bad' is almost written on the walls...it's very sanctimonious, it's really not subtle...but there are movies where they only show horrible things the way they really are, without really giving a judgement in an explicit way...I think it even works better. I am a bit tired of moralizers, to be honest.The acting is very good.  Also, I got the French Limited DVD of this film...that's the best edition, trust me!  The audio tracks are in french (which Pasolini considered should have been the original language of this film, because it was the Marquis de Sade's and also the original Italian track.  The one in french is amazing, really.  There are also lots of extras, this is really a must-have.  The actors, especially the four fascists, are extremely cold and creepy...Pasolini did a good job directing them.Overall, the film takes a very neutral approach to the horrors it displays, but that's effective.  Sure, this is not a perfect movie, it has pretty slow moments and it is not that well structured, but it achieves its goal, which is to make a statement against fascism.8/10",Null,0,5,2 April 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," I can't believe it's not nominated for 1999's best film!
","Eyes Wide Shut was the last Kubrick masterpiece (his last film, in other words). We can say his carreer (and life) ended in a nice way (without being mean). This film is amazing, mysterious, very well acted and extremely well directed! I can't understand why it is not nominated for last year's best movie! I thought this one was better than American Beauty, which was my favorite of last year before seeing Eyes Wide Shut (but I didn't see Man On The Moon). I guess the Academy couldn't nominate it because it was ''too hot for Oscar''. This is not the best Kubrick film (with films like 2001:A Space Odyssey, Dr.Strangelove, The Shining, Full Metal Jacket and Clockwork Orange, it's pretty hard to do better than all of these!!!!!) but it worth watching! When I told people I wanted to see Eyes Wide shut, they said ''I wonder why!'' but they were wrong...when you watch this film, go further than watching the nudity and fast-forwarding the rest of the film...if you do so, you won't like the film. I am a big fan of Kubrick movies and I was very interested in the whole film. It was mysterious, the atmosphere was very enjoyable. Kubrick made a kind of mix of his films (Lolita, Clockwork Orange and even The Shining!!!). A must-see! the ending was like the ending of the other Kubrick films, surprising, intelligent and appropriate. I loved it. I give it 90%.",10,1,1,19 March 2000
Die Hard," The Die Hard Trilogy is the best action movie collection...
","Die Hard is one of my favorite action films.  They made two sequels, but this one, the first one, is the best.  Bruce Willis is an underestimated actor, even though he played in some pretty bad movies. Die Hard is THE perfect mix of INTENSE action, very funny jokes and one-liners and entertainment at its best. And there's even more; the acting is very good. This is one of the most entertaining films I've seen for sure, and it's the perfect one to watch when you don't want to think a lot and when your brain is tired and doesn't want to work. All I can say about this film is positive. It is long enough, there are no weak moments, and you're staying on the edge of your seat during the two big hours of fun that this film brings you. The story is conventional, but there are details that make this film more intelligent than the average action flick. And I was very surprised by how violent Die Hard was. It's pretty bloody and there are a lot of gun shots. Fun fun fun. I loved it. 8/10",Null,0,1,16 December 2000
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," In one word:AWESOME!!!
","This movie is wonderful! The acting was perfect(Jack Nicholson was playing guy who was sick in the head, like The Shining). The setting was exceptional and the characters were funny. This is a kind of comedy that is not laughing at the mentally disturbed people, but that shows the other side of their sickness. They want their freedom, they don't know what to choose, and all other details make them interesting characters. We pity them when the guards are mean to them and we finally hate the guards. In normal movies, it would have been the opposite;the patients would be dangerous and the guards would be the good guys. This would be like telling to the audience''those sick people are dangerous. A real moral that will make you laugh in a good way. A masterpiece! I give it 95%.",10,1,4,16 January 2000
Cube," This is a treasure hidden under an absence of reputation...
","Cube is one of the most terrifying films I've seen. Freaky to death, you almost become insane yourself. The story is about six people who are emprisoned in a cubic complex. There are deadly traps in some of the rooms...There is one gate in the whole complex that gets you out of the place...The budget in this film was low...they wasted half of it on the first two minutes. But, for a low-budget film, it has very good special and gory effects and the actors are great too. The background is always the same, but the walls are different from one room from another. Paranoia, intolerance, fear, these subjects are all important in Cube. The film is also full of surprising twists. The first time you see it, you just can't believe it...the music is mainly made of creepy samples and contributes to the freaky atmosphere of the movie. Disturbing, intelligent, well acted, very well directed, wow, that's one huge discovery! Excellent, awesome. I know this ain't a masterpiece, but it is still too great for a 8. So now my choice is clear, even though you may think I'm too generous, I have to give it the mark it deserves. 9/10",Null,0,1,23 December 2000
High Fidelity," 2000's funniest!!!
","VERY FUNNY! AWESOME FILM! Seriously, it's so so so funny!  John Cusack is perfect for this role, perfect!  He's exactly the guy they needed. Tim Robbins is funny too, especially in the imagination scene!!! You'll know what I mean when you'll see it! This is the perfect film for people who have a little culture in music, and who are not afraid of vulgarity or that enjoy rock and roll...The story is about a man that owns a Vinyl discs shop who tries to find back the girls he loved during his years of high school...believe me, along with Meet The Parents, this is one of the best comedies of this year, and a couple of years before...in my opinion.  The mentality of Cusack and his work mates is just so coloured, it's awesome, it's funny, it's exactly how I imagine that kind of person for real...This is perfect to watch with a bunch of friends followed by Dead Alive or Bad Taste....excellent comedy! 8/10!",Null,0,1,13 April 2001
