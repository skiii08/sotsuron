Bohemian Rhapsody," Rocky beginning, but ultimatley powerful
","While oddly paced and a bit clich√© in the beginning as Mercury is shown rising into fame (it almost feels like a non-engaging re-enacted documentary), the film develops towards the halfway point, ultimately telling a story that is incredibly powerful.",9,1,3,4 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A spectacular film
","I don't think it's perfect, but I do think it's beautiful... even magical",9,15,23,7 August 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Exciting
","Thought the film largely resembles the first, it sets itself apart by using the arena in a new way. Maybe it lost speed in the middle, but more than made up for it towards the end. It exciting.",8,0,0,15 June 2019
