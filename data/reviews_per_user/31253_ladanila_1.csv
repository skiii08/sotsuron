Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not very credible if you compare the classic trilogy
",The structure of the plot and especially some characters are not well developed. If you have already seen the classic trilogy could be disappointed....but it's good for children of the 2000. We have gained in computer descriptions but we have lost in depth and in immensity of the history....,4,0,1,6 May 2000
