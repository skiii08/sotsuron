The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," terrible writing
","Okay i admit I've seen all the instalments in the series. Its like harry potter i got to watch them all. Except harry potter was good. This movie just drug on and on with nothing happening until the last 20mins of the movie. Jacob's like i will kill you Edward if she dies...she dies! OK umm ya i cant kill you because i... blah blah blah. omg were wolfs and we hate vampires were going to kill you!....no Wait were going to help you protect Bella. if Bella becomes a vampire we have no choice but to kill her!...no were not going to kill her now. this type of crap went on threw out the entire movie. there is no suspense because you know whats going to happen, its easily predictable.I hope the second one isn't like this... well ya it probably will be. there s a reason why IMDb has such a low score on this film.",3,5,6,16 November 2012
