Iron Man 3," Great movie in and of itself, but inconsistent with the lore of the other movies.
","This movie is great, go see it, just watch out and keep your mind a little more open, because the marketing makes the movie look completely different to what it actually is.GO SEE IT Now, SPOILERS!!! The only real problem i have with the movie is inconsistency. The plot is inconsistent with the other movie.For instance, the Ten Rings is an actual terrorist organization in Iron Man 1, but here, they just make the Mandarin a cover-up for the real villain, who you could see coming miles away when you first see him. The twist that (HUGE SPOILER) the Mandarin is actually an actor playing a role is a great twist, if it made sense. The only way that they could possibly redeem this twist is if the REAL Mandarin, aka. The Ring Leader (pardon the pun) of the Ten Rings terrorist organization, is the villain in number 4, otherwise there's this massive hole in the plot between 1 and 3.Otherwise, in and of itself, this film is dramatic, funny and a really good time at the theatres. I'm not buthurt like some people over the sillification (that's what i'm calling it) of the Mandarin, but i get where they're coming from (imagine if they did that to the Joker. Even if the movie was otherwise amazing, people would hate it more that Batman and Robin).Conclusion: Iron Man 3 is a great film that has a twist nobody saw coming, and therefore potentially ruined the film for some people. If you're a comic book fan, you may not like this film, especially if you're a fan of the Mandarin character.",8,2,4,2 May 2013
Unbreakable," A subversive superhero film made FAR before its time.
","When I first watched this film as a child, I thought it was a boring, slow romp with little resolution. It was short, with hardly any action, and the action it did have had basically zero choreography and style to it.This was a superhero movie made in 2000, the same year the first X- Men movie came out, two years before the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man film, and a massive eight years before the Dark Knight. When Unbreakable was first released, superheroes were still seen as a childish affair, as the world was recovering from Batman and Robin and other badly made, low budget childish comic movies. Unbreakable was a massive shift from the norm, a piece that could be set in the real world.Rewatching it now, this film is an incredible piece that would have been far better received and successful if it were released closer to the present. An emotional film about a man slowly discovering he isn't as normal as he lets on, and an obsessed comic-book nerd who leads him to that truth.The pacing is still incredibly slow for a superhero flick, which may be jarring for some people who come into it expecting such a film. However, if they come in with zero expectation, or expecting a traditional thriller-type movie, they might be pleasantly surprised.If you haven't seen this film yet, I highly recommend it. It was made before director M. Night Shyamalan's fall from critical grace, so you can expect a tight, well written and relatively subtle film with great performances.",9,0,1,22 January 2017
Captain Marvel," A decent, middling entry to the MCU that doesn't quite live to its potential
","Probably the most disappointing thing about this movie is the fact that this middling, decent, but not outstanding film is the first female led movie in the MCU. Love it or hate it, at least Black Panther had some artistic vision behind it, but Captain Marvel, both as the first female lead superhero as the lead-up to Endgame feels like squandered potential.Please note that I'm not really familiar with the comic lore, and I came in as a casual superhero movie fan.The good things that come to mind are the relationship between Fury and Vers was fun. Slightly uncanny de-ageing effects on Fury aside, there was quite a bit of chemistry between them and I enjoyed the film when they were together.Also the twist that happens in the middle (as someone who only had minimal knowledge on the Skrulls and Kree (I know the Skrulls are the bad guys in a lot of early Fantastic Four stories)) that the Skrulls were actually the underdogs to the growing Kree empire was neat, and that her mentor at the beginning of the film wasn't Mar-Vell (I think Jude Law was listed as Mar-Vell online before the film released) but was the true villain was also a cool secondary twist. Although I knew that Vers was actually a human all along, the way the plot revealed how she ended up having her memory of Earth wiped, and how she was adopted by the Kree was compelling stuff.Now, the bad. The movie lacks a coherent sense of style. In terms of set design, effects, choreography and cinematography, it's severely lacking when compared to The Avengers or Black Panther. While BP was lacking in CG effects in many parts of the film, it had art design aplenty to compensate. Captain Marvel looks VERY boring, bordering on Power Rangers in terms of costuming and effects. The fight choreography took several steps back, with the awful editing to make it seem fast paced but in reality just made me dizzy and gave me a mild headache. Captain Marvel's powers, while at parts impressive, seem very inconsistent. Sometimes she's able to blow up ships, whereas others she barely dents the wall. I know that she was Nerfed by the Kree, but even then her power level seemed to go up and down a lot, without any clear rules as to her actual strengths and weaknesses at any time. Although I will admit I always have a bit of a soft spot for Avatar glowy eyes whenever they happen in movies or TV, and Captain Marvel doesn't disappoint there.Of course, now we have to address the elephant in the room. This is gonna be one of those movies, like Last Jedi, that political pundits on both sides will use to push their agenda. The Right Wing has already attempted to review bomb this movie's Rotten Tomatoes page to the point where RT had to temporarily shut down audience reviews (and by mentioning this, I'm bound to get some hate too), and in reaction, I 100% guarantee a lot of Left WIngers will do the exact same thing, except in the opposite direction by over-praising this movie. This movie doesn't deserve the amount of hate directed to it, nor does Brie Larson. This movie is just another run-of-the-mill superhero movie, nothing worth getting into a tizzy over. The film definitely makes several pro-feminist statements, and while I'm a feminist myself, they definitely were a bit ham-fisted, even compared to Wonder Woman, which handled the feminist themes incredibly well in comparison.I hope for the next Captain Marvel movie, they do some more interesting stuff, give the character more to do. Or better yet, do some more compelling female led superhero movies that aren't the same old space opera stuff. Do She-Hulk, or an actual Black WIdow movie, or make the Captain Marvel sequel Ms. Marvel and do Kamala Khan's story. There's a lot of room for experimentation and new stories to tell with a female perspective that I'm sure a lot of people, including me, would appreciate.Ultimately, if this film inspires a young girl to get more into comics, then it has done its job well.",7,0,2,10 March 2019
Zootopia," Marginally better than Inside Out, Much better than Frozen
","(Don't get me wrong, I love Frozen, but I feel it's been overplayed in pop culture that it's more boring than it should be. Maybe a few years of space will revive it)Zootopia is a fantastic film, quite analogous to the current political climate in the western world, but still a fun film even when the themes are ignored.We follow Judy Hopps, a rabbit who has a dream of becoming a Police Officer. However, in the world of Zootopia, the Police Force is dominated by larger animals, making Judy the first Rabbit on the force.Right out the gate, the film makes it obvious the story is about prejudice, but it has a few twists along the way.You see, there are two polarities in Zootopia. There's Predator/Prey relations, and Size relations. The world attempts to accommodate for the needs of all the inhabitants, but the world is still ruled by stereotypes. Judy Hopps has to fight hard for her position, having to be the Valedictorian of her class at the Police Academy, but she is still relegated to being a Parking Officer because of her size. She is forced to prove herself to be the best, even though a fair society will have given her the benefit of the doubt.The other polarity is Predator/Prey relations, a direct parallel to Majority/Minority races in the Western World. The Predators are a minority in the world of Zootopia, making about 10% of the population. Because of their evolutionary ancestors, there is a prejudice against them that they could turn feral at any moment, becoming ruthless killers like they were before they became anthropomorphic animal-people. The plot in Act 2 and 3 becomes a political conspiracy to frame the predators for a series of attacks against the prey to throw society against them. This can be seen in real life, especially regarding how the west sees Muslim people and/or black people.The one flaw, however, is that they pull a very similar plot twist to Frozen, in that a background character is revealed to be the 'True' Villain, just like Hans. Just like Frozen, the villain reveal comes literally minutes before the end of the film, making their impact to the story rushed.Overall, this is a great movie, and a very timely one at that. Perhaps some of the pop-culture references will become dated, but like all Disney movies, there will be enough here to make the film a timeless classic.",9,4,13,22 March 2016
Oldboy," Not my personal type of movie, but really good for what it is
","(This Review is originally from my blog at http://samuentagareview.blogspot.com/. Feel free to check out my other reviews)Oldboy is probably the most famous South Korean film in the entire world, and since it's being remade by Spike Lee this year, I figured I'd watch the original film to see what the fuss was about.And wow. Wow. Wow.So, I'm just going to go SPOILER this time, because anyone who wants to see it probably already has.So this guy, Oh Dae Su, is kidnapped and kept in solitary confinement for fifteen years, the only contact with the outside world being the guards that feed him and never talk, and the television in his room. Suddenly, after fifteen years, he is set free, and decides to find out why he was kept inside that room for fifteen years.So then he meets this girl at a sushi bar, eats a live octopus whole, and then faints. He wakes up in her house, and a very awkward, sexually tense relationship begins as the two try and find out who put him in prison.Eventually, they find a security guard at the place he was kept, and try to find out who captured him by pulling his teeth out with a hammer. (By the way, this film is really gruesome) and then the famous single-take fight sequence begins, and it's really good. That's definitely the highlight of the film, and there's nothing else that quite matches up to it in the rest, unfortunately.Finally, following a couple of deaths, sex with the random girl, and several close calls to the man behind everything, he finally catches up to the man, who reveals everything that happened.So Oh Dae Su and the bad guy used to go to the same school, and the villain had this rather, um, inappropriate relationship with his sister. Oh Dae Su, on his last day at the school, sees this, and spreads a rumor around the school, not realizing that they were siblings. She starts having signs of pregnancy, and commits suicide.Then the villain, in anguish, decides to enact revenge, kidnaps Oh Dae Su, keeps him away from his daughter for fifteen years, then releases him and with help from a hypnotist, gets Oh Dae Su to fall in love with his daughter, the girl at the sushi bar.So then, Oh Dae Su is stricken with guilt, begs the villain to not tell the girl, and cuts off his tongue for no reason, resulting in the villain letting him go, and killing himself.So now, Oh Dae Su tracks down the hypnotist and gets her to make him forget about the identity of the girl he met at the sushi bar, so that they can continue their relationship without the guilt in Oh Dae Su's heart.What the heck.Yes, this movie is really well made and brutal, but it's also all kinds of messed up. I have no idea how they're going to remake this for more conservative American cinema, but a lot of the plot twists have to be readjusted for the remake.It's really a personal preference, but this sort of stuff just makes me uncomfortable sitting there, watching it.So yeah, it's good. Just make sure you know what you're going into, if you haven't seen it yet.",8,4,8,16 May 2013
Doctor Strange," The Most Visually Striking Marvel Film So Far
","If there's one thing Doctor Strange has going for it, it's the sense of style. This is an incredible looking film, like Inception except take out the symbolism and amp up the excitement to eleven. The film convincingly makes magic look cool, and in a totally different way to other film's portrayals of magic. This ain't a Harry Potter rip off, that's for sure. The Magic here is a mix of Eastern philosophy, metaphysics, and some classic sci-fi mumbo-jumbo, but it feels fun and convincing enough.I feel the film does lack in some areas. Mads Mikkelsen severely underused in his role as the villain, Rachel McAdams plays a romantic interest more boring than Natalie Portman in Thor (seriously Marvel, please work on your female characters. Besides Black Widow and arguably Pepper Potts, you are lacking in that department) and the Doctor himself is a bit unlikeable in a few bits, but really it's a redemption/hero origin story, so it's not as bad as it could have been.I really did like Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, though. There was some controversy surrounding the casting of a British woman as a person who was in the original comics an old Tibetan man, but Swinton does a great job as playing a very unconventional 'wise person' trope. She is powerful, but has a sense of humour, and her casting bypasses the potential of some questionable issues of racial stereotypes present in the original version of the story. I also liked Benedict Wong as the temple librarian. He's a great minor character that really fits into the Marvel Universe.The greatest of commendations really goes to the Post Production crew, with some of the best looking visual effects I've ever seen. I saw it in 3D, and while it isn't at all necessary to do so, the 3D effects really did elevate some of the more abstract and hallucinogenic sequences in the film.Overall, Doctor Strange is up there as one of the better films in the Marvel Canon, and in my opinion, the best looking one so far.",8,2,4,1 November 2016
Justice League," Rushed, weirdly paced, mixed bag, tonally inconsistent
","So...this movie exists.So I think comparing this film to The Avengers is apt since they are both ensemble superhero films, and Joss Whedon has writing credits on both of them.Here's the issue:The MCU made sure all relevant characters were properly introduced in their own films before putting them together in the Avengers. Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and Hulk had their own movies with their own story arcs and character development. Say what you want about the quality of the individual films, but the fact that they pulled it off as good as they did is impressive, to say the least.Now for the DCEU, we got Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, and Wonder Woman. I'm not counting Suicide Squad since that is barely relevant to the rest of them and none of the major characters there are present in Justice League. So the DCEU Batman didn't get his own flick. You can argue that Batman V Superman is a Batman movie, but it doesn't really feel like it. Neither Batman or Superman really fit as the main protagonist. It's all pretty jumbled. Wonder Woman worked, but that was because they didn't have Zach Snyder messing around too much, and it was its own thing for the most part. But we still had the Flash, Cyborg and Aquaman to develop in Justice League, in a relatively small timeframe of 2 hours (compared to the epic 3 hour Batman V Superman) To be fair to the writers, they did a decent job with the new characters. Flash is funny and likable. Aquaman is also pretty fun, albeit less developed. Cyborg is sort of boring, but he has some room to develop later.The story though is just...what??? The MCU did a great job introducing the broader conflicts of the Avengers within the smaller movies. In Thor, they introduce a few McGuffins, and they did the same in Captain America 1, so that when you see them in the Avengers, it makes sense.The Avengers also made Loki, a character we've seen before, the main villain of the story. We know who he is, and what his motivations are before the story begins, so we aren't confused. Meanwhile, who the hell is Steppenwolf? Where did he come from, why is he terraforming the world? (Earth seems to get terraformed a lot in this universe) I haven't read the comics, I don't know who he is. He's doing the same thing as Zod in MoS, and he looks like Ares. It's derivative. The bug-minions are pretty neat, but who cares about them, really?Also, spoilers, Superman comes back to life. Contrary to my expectations, they sort of retcon the ending of Batman V Superman (where the dirt on Superman's coffin begins to float) by having the Justice League actively resurrecting Superman using the cube things, but once again, that part is rushed. Superman is evil for 5 minutes, but then Lois comes along and calms him down and then he's good again.Superman is actually fun in this one though and is less mopey. Probably because he was dead for a while and was brought back. Hopefully, they keep that character element in later films.Yes, I have a lot of issues with this film, but I do think it's a step in the right direction for the franchise. It's more fun compared to the other dark gritty nonsense. We've got set up for new interesting characters, including a sneak peek at the Green Lantern Corps. I want to see a Flash movie and an Aquaman movie. I think both of those characters need a lot more to do. Cyborg, sure why not. I also want to see Shazam, and whatever other silly characters DC wants to do.The box office returns for this film were lower than expected, apparently. I think DC needs to do a bit of corporate restructuring (aka fire Snyder) and hire some good writers, but after that, fingers crossed, we can start seeing DC movies match up to the same standards (or even higher) as the MCU.",5,2,5,22 November 2017
Split," A Sincerely Great Return to Form for M. Night Shyamalan.
","M. Night's career has for the longest time been considered a tragedy. A director whose debut was so great he was hyped up to be the next Spielberg, followed up that film with two decent films, two controversial films, and three downright awful films. What a mixed bag of a career.When he made the film 'The Visit', while I didn't like it myself, some critics and fans began saying it may be a return to true form for the writer/director.Now we know it's true, at least for now, that M. Night is coming back around to critics and fans alike with Split, a genuinely suspenseful and well written thriller.The film follows three teenage girls, who are abducted by a man with dissociative identity disorder (aka Split Personality Disorder) for an unknown purpose. While the girls attempt to escape their prison, the man visits an elderly psychologist with a long-standing relationship with the man. This is the basic gist of the story without venturing too far into spoilers.From Psycho to Fight Club, split personality stories are fairly common within the thriller genre. It, along with Schizophrenia and Psychopathy/Sociopathy, is a fairly easy way to create a 'complex' villain for the story, however I believe that with the film's major twist (because of course there's a twist), Split becomes a unique entry in this particular trope.James McAvoy is great as the man, he has very distinct and developed postures and voices for each of the personalities that is quite outstanding. The three girls are also quite decent in their portrayals, and the psychologist is a very likable side character that genuinely cares for McAvoy's character(s).Overall, this film is great for the thriller fan, and a great return to form for the director.",8,2,11,18 January 2017
The Shining," As a fan of the original novel, this movie makes me sad.
","I'm going to get a lot of hate for this opinion, but I'll say it anyway.I don't like this movie.Mainly because I love the book.If this movie wasn't associated with the book, I probably would enjoy it more.I'll keep this quick, but the main reasons I don't like the book are as follows.1. Wendy Torrance: What is a fantastically strong mother figure in the novel turns into an annoying screaming woman who does nothing productive in the movie. She takes little responsibility for her son, and when Jack snaps, she cries in a corner rather than try to get out of the situation. I get that both reactions are legitimate for the situation, but I don't understand why Kubrick decided that a weak female character was better than a strong female character.2. The Shining is severely underplayed. In this story, the Shining is the name Hallorann gives the psychic powers he and Danny share. In the novel, the shining is very important to the film and is the main reason that Wendy and Danny survive the ordeal, whereas in the film, a lot of it could be chalked up to coincidence.3. Hallorann dies. There's a reason that the weapon in the novel is a croquet mallet, as opposed to an ax. I get that an ax is much better for the purposes of tension than a mallet, but it's hard to survive being hit by an ax. So in both the novel and the movie, Hallorann is summoned by the Shining, and is the first victim of mad-Jack, but because in the movie it's an ax rather than a mallet, he dies. Why does the hero of the story, and the only African American character die? He's also the only person that dies. The only victim of Mad Jack is the only African American character, who is the hero in the original book. I don't think that Stanley Kubrick is racist at all, but it's a very perplexing decision anyway.4. It overshadowed the book. While the novel is a typical haunting story with great characters, the movie is the exact polar opposite of that, and is therefore more respected in terms of plot. I'm sure most people who have seen the film haven't read the book, and consider it as a stand-alone work. The conspiracy theorists that connect this film to the moon landing also probably consider this film independent of the book. This is sad because I love the book, and I feel that the characters in said book are very well developed, three dimensional and not-too- stereotypical. It's strange that a director known more for his purely cinematic and plot-centric movies adapted a story that relied more on emotion and character than logic. I completely understand why Stephen King didn't like this adaptation and licensed the television miniseries as a reaction (a series that was panned because it was compared to the film) It's also an odd thing to adapt compared to Kubrick's other adaptations (A Clockwork Orange and 2001, both of which are very niche novels to my knowledge) that he would also adapt something that is more 'NYT Bestseller' than 'Literature'. I'll just stop here. I already probably annoyed a lot of you with my ignorance already, so just consider this: People probably also hate the LOTR films because they abandon something that was in the original film. I personally love them because they are great films, but just because a film is good in its own right, doesn't mean that it's a good adaptation. And because there's no such thing as a good adaptation, there will always be someone who hates the film because it doesn't compare to the book, and vice versa.",7,2,6,13 July 2014
Ratatouille," An amazing film about what it means to be an artist, and a critic
","I forgot how good this movie is, but rewatching it, I definitely consider it one of the best Pixar films to date. Mature in its storytelling, but kid friendly enough, Ratatouille tells the story of Remy, a rat with a keen, almost supernatural, sense of taste and smell, making him unique amongst rats in his ability to cook and create new flavours. However, his status as a rat prevents him from pursuing this dream, until he meets Linguini, a young man who is incompetent in the kitchen, but is somehow able to act as Remy's puppet, a human vessel allowing him to pursue his dream, but not without some resistance.The main thing that makes this movie great is the ending. At the climax of the film, Anton Ego, the shadowy restaurant critic whose scathing review led to the death of Gusteau, the original owner of Gusteau's restaurant, enters the newly refurbished restaurant with Linguini in charge, expecting to tear it down in the same way. However, when he's presented a perfect dish, and meeting the true chef behind it, he writes perhaps one of the best monologues in film history, something that, in essence, is what critics in all forms do.Ego in essence makes fun of himself and the role of being a critic, a person who risks nothing writing scathing reviews of those who truly work their hardest to present them something. This is undeniable. No critic can truly say that their reviews matter more than the piece of food, establishment or media that they are criticising. Anyone can say 'The Room' is a bad film, but in objective fact, many people worked incredibly hard to make it over years. That in itself makes The Room more valuable than any single review, positive or negative. Me saying Ratatouille is a good movie doesn't matter much when compared to the impact the movie made on the world at large.But he does give himself a little credit. Critics are great and valuable in one particular way: revealing things that are new and worthwile, before the masses discover it. Maybe you read a review for a niche arthouse film that you never heard of before, and that movie becomes your favourite film ever made. That is incredibly valuable, both to you, the critic, and the artist who you discovered. You can then act as a critic yourself, and spread the love further. Going back to the Room, a movie so bad that it has spawned a media empire of people loving to hate it. That required critics to discover, see it as the so-bad-it's-good masterpiece it is, and spread it amongst the masses. Critics are in essence on the front lines of culture, being the first to see and comment on the latest things. Maybe that makes them a bit pretentious at times, gives them an inflated ego, but I still maintain that critics are incredibly important to the functionality of arts, entertainment and food industries, in that they can help people find motivation to keep moving forward.Beyond that, Ratatouille is a really fun kids movie with cute rats and incredible music. Watch it again if you haven't seen it in a while.",10,0,0,19 March 2020
The Conjuring 2," A great horror sequel, not as good as the first
","The Conjuring 2 is a period piece horror film that continues the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two demonologists who are most well known for their investigations into the Amityville haunting. The first film was set before Amityville and concerned one of their lesser known cases. This film is set after Amityville, and mainly concerns the Enfield Poltergeist.The films obviously take a lot of liberties to what *actually* happened. Let's just say that this film is set in an alternate reality where every investigation the Warren family looks into is entirely true. If anyone looks into the actual footage and evidence in the case, it seems to be a pretty elaborate hoax, but in this film, it isn't.That being said, this is an incredibly effective horror film, and some moments definitely caused me to feel incredibly anxious, and I frequently felt the need to push against the seat to get as far away from the screen as possible. The family is incredibly charming and likable, and the acting, especially the main girl character, I found to be quite impressive. There is also a carryover story from the first film concerning the Warren family, as they question the reason why they do what they do.There were some cheesy moments throughout the film that distracted me a little. Some weird and out of place editing choices and other minor stuff. There is an over reliance of CGI in a few scenes that I found distracting. CGI, especially when it's CGI characters, are incredibly hard to make scary, and this film is no exception. However, for the most part this issue is avoided in favour of more traditional methods of scaring the audience.Overall a quality film that is definitely worth watching if you liked the first film. It's not a better film than the first, but there isn't a massive drop in quality that occasionally occurs in sequels.",8,33,71,3 June 2016
Yesterday," Decent movie that doesn't quite live up to its great premise
","Yesterday tells the story of Jack, an amateur musician who is trying to break into the industry with the help of his best friend Ellie, but when he gets hit by a truck riding his bike home one night, he wakes up in an alternate universe where several things have turned out to have never existed, but most importantly the Beatles and their songs. Jack decides to take advantage of this, and uses the Beatles' music to launch his career, becoming the most famous pop star in the world.That premise sounds great, and I was looking forward to a surreal comedy, but to be honest, it doesn't quite live up to it, instead getting distracted by what the actual main plot turned out to be: a cliche romantic comedy with the childhood friend that is secretly in love with the protagonist, only for him to figure it out for himself later.The best moments of this film are to do with the central premise of the alternate universe, where Jack would reference something, only for the people around him to say 'what's that?' I mean, it's the same joke in different words basically every time, but hey, the way they execute it is pretty good. There are also some decent satirical moments with Jack interacting with the music industry, personified by Jack's manager, and an extended cameo by Ed Sheeran, who falls victim to some self-deprecating jokes, but overall seems to be the secondary 'star' of the show besides the Beatles' music.Speaking of the Beatles, you'd be surprised by how little they actually contribute to the plot. For a film that is named after one of their more famous songs, you'd think that their music and impact to society would be more than just a plot device for the main character to achieve his success. There's no real commentary as to why the Beatles music is so great, you're just told, over and over again, that they're the greatest band ever, and that a world without them ever existing would suck. Sure, that is something I would agree with, but the film doesn't really add much of their own perspective to that side of the story, it just takes that idea as fact.The romance is decent, but cliche and overall unremarkable. Screenwriter Richard Curtist definitely knows how to write romances, having written several well regarded romcoms, like Love Actually and About Time, but I would say that Yesterday isn't quite up to that standard. Same goes for Danny Boyle and the other films he directed compared to this. The direction isn't bad, but it's bland and doesn't really add much to the story. There are some weird shots, like some weird dutch angles near the beginning of the story that seem out of place, but nothing else unusual or amazing about the camerawork either.I guess if you like romcoms and Beatles music, this movie will definitely be watchable, but for me, as a person who doesn't actively seek out that genre, this film didn't stand out to me in either direction, and overall I'm disappointed that they didn't take full advantage of the great premise.",5,120,224,24 June 2019
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A fantastic sequel: Enough said
","A lot of stuff happens in this movie. I won't spoil it, but since 5 years has passed in the universe of HTTYD, the film is undeniably more mature.I think the reason that there's a 5 year gap is to make room for the television show that's currently in production. I guess it will fill the gaps in between, which is fair enough.Probably the most surprising thing about this movie is the director. The original film was written and directed by 3 people (the guys who made Lilo and Stitch, another great film), but only one of them stayed behind to direct the sequel. I'll assume without evidence the other two moved either to the TV series or to some other project. But since it's more of a solo project than a threesome project, it's a lot less clichéd and a lot more focused on a single story.Yes, there is a lot of things that don't make sense, and a lot of things that could be changed, but lets ignore that for now and enjoy what is undeniably a spectacular film.",9,7,14,24 June 2014
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Not Tarantino's Best Work
","I mean, it was okay for what it was, but I really felt like what it was was an excuse for Quentin Tarantino to gush over 60's nostalgia, while also giving his good friend and convicted rapist Roman Polanski some sort of cathartic revenge on the people that killed his wife and unborn child by making some alternate reality where their fictional next door neighbours Rick Dalton and his stunt double brutally kill the Manson family members, because for some reason they decide to go into Rick's house instead.I really don't have much else to say. It's technically great, as always. It was a bit long and very loose in the plot department, and it feels like the ending with the Manson family was tacked on at the end, because it didn't really mesh with the rest of the story at all. The dialogue was fun, there were quite a few comedy moments that got a chuckle out of me. But it wasn't good. It's not Django Unchained, or Inglourious Basterds, or Kill Bill. I'm not big into Tarantino, I haven't seen all of his movies, but I respect his role in Hollywood, and I appreciate that he's one of the few working auteurs in the modern industry, but this film felt off to me.Also, this isn't a comment on the film itself, but more of meta commentary, but I find it VERY interesting how, according to Wikipedia, this is Tarantino's first feature film in years made without Harvey Weinstein producing, and for some reason, Tarantino decided to make a movie where another rapist in the form of Roman Polanski has a small but significant role in the story (and doesn't make any commentary on his character). This is also curious, as Tarantino is on record for having defended the actions of Polanski. Actions that, remind you, Polanski was CONVICTED for and fled from. I'm just saying, if some allegations are made against Tarantino, I would not be surprised at this point.",6,5,7,19 August 2019
The Lion King," Doesn't Do Enough to Distinguish Itself, Most Changes it Does Make Are Bad
","I give this one a 5/10 because it is mostly the same great movie from the 90's. Aside from a few additions and subtractions, the film is almost entirely a shot-for-shot remake of the original. So instead of focussing on that, I'll be focussing on the (very few) significant changes made to the plot of the film.Firstly, the film is almost entirely photorealistic. Meaning, certain more surreal and cartoony scenes are redone, most notably the musical numbers 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and 'Hakuna Matata'. You've already probably heard of the small controversy surrounding 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight'', which for some reason is now set in the afternoon instead of evening. It's silly changes like this that are most distracting.Another change is made to the Hyenas. In the original, the Hyenas are more-or-less meant to be representations of the underclass of society, with Scar representing a populist Dictator promising more to the hyenas to get their allegiance. They are shown as stupid and gullible in the original, and some people have interpreted this as classist. This is something that I guess Disney wanted to 'Fix' in the remake, so instead, the Hyenas here are shown as a rival kingdom who has exhausted their resources, and Scar offers an alliance with them, promising to share the food in exchange for them starting the stampede that killed Mufasa.Which brings me to the main villain, Scar. In the original film, Scar was one of the many campy villains of the DIsney Renaissance, being smart, cunning, and a little effeminate, as opposed to the brutish and masculine Mufasa. In the remake, they decided to remove the campy elements of the character, and instead he is both jealous of Mufasa's power, and the fact that Mufasa won the affections of Sarabi. Yes, in this version, Scar is motivated by lust for Simba's mum. I guess that's a bit closer to Hamlet? Maybe? Who knows? I won't say it's a bad change, just a neutral change that makes Scar a competent but less memorable villain.Now, one thing I do like about the remake that is different from the original is Timon and Pumba. Billy Eichner as Timon definitely plays up the 'gay' vibe that the original character had. And Seth Rogen as Pumba works really well. His casting as Pumba was spot on, while still being distinct from Ernie Sabella's original portrayal of the character. The duo is also the most 'self aware' of the film, in the sense that they make several coy fourth-wall-breaking jokes at the expense of the remake. I think that they were given the most creative freedom in terms of riffing off the original, and while it's not 'better' than the original, I can certainly appreciate its attempts to distinguish itself, especially compared to the rest of the film that makes barely any changes.There are also a couple more scenes added with adult Nala (to justify the casting of Beyonce, no doubt) but they don't add much to the plot or change it in any significant way.My biggest problem with the remake is just the overall pacing. While it is for the most part a shot for shot remake, it feels like a cover band whose drummer isn't the best, and occasionally misses a beat. The original film is short and sweet at 88 minutes, while the remake is 118 minutes, meaning they needed to make up about 20 extra minutes of runtime, which for the most part, aside from the few changes, was done by stretching and squishing the original scenes to different lengths, which throws off the natural rhythm a person who saw the original would have when watching this. There were several moments where I cringed at just the pacing of the film. I felt how off it was. It was weird and uncanny, moreso than the character design.Overall, this film isn't really worth watching. It's gonna make millions of dollars off the nostalgia alone, but seriously, just find the original movie online streaming somewhere and watch that instead. Have a party where you watch the original, and call it the 'Spite Disney Party'. I'm not going to hold it against you if you do watch the remake. I mean, I watched it, I'd be a hypocrite if I made a moral judgement against people who watch this version, but seriously, don't do what I did. Save a bit of money and rent the original. This movie isn't bad, but there's a better version of it already out there.",5,6,10,22 July 2019
Logan," A Beautiful End to Wolverine's Saga
","Bryan Singer's X-men hit cinemas back in 2000, when the superhero genre was still recovering from a certain case of 'Batman and Robin'. It was hard to take comics seriously, but Singer brought the X-men, a team of superheroes that faced problems not many other heroes face (that being discrimination) to the big screen in a grand sort of way. An allegory for the struggle many minorities, especially the LGBT+ people, face in the real world, audiences empathised both with Charles Xavier's pursuit of protection of the Mutants, and the education of the masses that these Mutants aren't as bad and scary as they may seem at first, and Magneto's pursuit of vengeance against the people who abused him almost his entire life.And in the centre of this broader narrative is Wolverine, a man that, while youthful in appearance, is hundreds of years older than any of the other main characters in the story, but cannot remember his past beyond a name. An unstoppable killing machine fuelled by rage, pain and distrust, he is brought into the fold as a broken man, with the promise that Xavier would help him rediscover who he really is.Hugh Jackman's Wolverine is arguably one of the best cast and most famous characters brought from comic book to screen. Even in the films that were brought down by mediocrity in other areas, Jackman played Wolverine with power and precision. But no matter how good he was in his past movies, nothing matches up to his performance in Logan.Logan is the last Wolverine film. Hugh Jackman said so himself that it would be his final portrayal as the Wolverine, and while it's entirely possible in the cynical Hollywood market that produced three different portrayals of Spider-Man within 10 years, I highly doubt Jackman would go back on his claim.The plot of Logan seems to be separate from the broader X-men franchise, sort of like how Deadpool wasn't really a part of the established continuity. Unlike Deadpool, which was a goofy, vulgar and crass film (still good though), Logan is gritty, sincere and tragic. Both films have the same amount of violence and gore, but while you laugh as Deadpool cuts a man in half, you don't laugh here. You feel every single cut and bullet in this film. Both physical and emotional.The heart of the film is the relationship between Logan, Xavier, and a new character named Laura, who is revealed to be Logan's biological daughter, and exhibiting similar powers. Laura, having just escaped from a government facility, is being chased by Pierce, a mercenary with a robot hand. What follows is an action packed road trip across the continental United States from New Mexico to North Dakota. I won't spoil the details, for this movie is worth watching all the way.Logan is what I was hoping for in every way when I heard of an R- Rated Wolverine film. It is not simply an excuse to add some CGI blood and limbs coming off Wolverine's victims (although there is plenty of that if that's all you're looking for) but it also works as a fantastic culmination of Wolverine's character arc throughout all of his portrayals. Logan is a beautiful film in all the best ways. Emotional, visceral, and entirely separate from any extended universe of films. There is nothing hinging on this film, canonically speaking. You should enter this film not expecting something that will play into later films, but as an entirely separate film that allowed everyone involved to explore a story and characters in an isolation chamber of sorts. It is one of the best superhero movies of all time, and definitely the most mature and grounded one since The Dark Knight.10/10",10,2,8,1 March 2017
Midsommar," How to make flowers and sunlight scary
","Midsommar is a very atypical horror film, at least in presentation. The plot is not entirely unique, about outsiders stumbling into a small village run by a cult (reminiscent of other folk horror films like The Wicker Man) but the way it's filmed is incredible. Ari Aster has done something very special, mixing beauty with horror in a seamless fashion.The plot goes like this, a college student named Dani suffers a massive trauma due to the sudden death of the rest of her family. The next year, her boyfriend and his friends are planning on going to a remote village in Northern Sweden to observe and study the village's strange midsummer festival. Dani wants to tag along too, wanting to escape from her life and trauma for a little while, but when they arrive, they get more than they bargained for, as the town's festivals prove to be much more strange and horrific than originally anticipated.The film has a lot in common with Aster's previous film Hereditary, in that it explores themes of death, trauma and family connections, as well as the occult. However, Midsommar takes a very different angle to the concept, both in presentation and in plot. While Hereditary did have a great story, and did veer off the beaten path that is horror, it is still a fairly typical horror film in other ways, especially that film's climax, which very much fits in with more mainstream horror films like the Conjuring. Midsommar, however, avoids typical horror tropes for the most part, as the film is set almost entirely during the daylight hours (which makes sense, since in Northern Sweden, midsummer days stretch on for hours, while the nights are incredibly short), so hiding things in the dark of the night proves to be much harder when there's sunlight for most of the day. Aster solves this with the use of visual effects simulating the feeling of being on a bad drug trip, shockingly vivid portrayals of gore and death (that at the same time isn't too gratuitous like the Saw films) and the strange perplexing customs of the cult village that gives both the American main characters, and the audience, a growing sense of unease and dread.I don't want to spoil the ending, beyond saying that things don't go well for the tourists, but there was a certain level of ambiguity in how the story ends, similar to the ending of Hereditary. It's obvious that there's plenty of things to analyze and interpret on a rewatch, and it's a film that's ripe for Youtube channels to dig through and analyse frame by frame.While I wouldn't say I liked it as much as Hereditary, Midsommar is a wholly unique horror film that deviates a little from horror norms and expectations, to create a surreal and uneasy horror experience.",8,1,6,15 August 2019
The Witch," Not scary, but worth seeing anyway
","Horror is inherently a very subjective genre. It is about as subjective as comedy, perhaps even more so. Both comedy and horror are ruled by emotions that vary widely from person to person. For example, most critics hate Adam Sandler comedies (with a few exceptions) but audiences still receive them. Why? Because they find it funny. The same can be said for horror. Paranormal Activity has gone stale for most people, but there are still a lot of people that watch it. Why? Because they think it's scary. There are going to be people that like the new Ghostbusters movie, and people that are going to like the new 'The Ring' reboot that is coming out this year (seriously).The Witch, like 'It Follows' and 'The Babadook' before it, follows a trend of critically acclaimed, slow paced psychological horror movies that perhaps unintentionally market themselves as epic monster pieces that are full of scares. The Witch isn't full of scares. The concepts behind it are scary, but you won't jump in your seat. I didn't at least. The Witch is a mellow piece that builds tension over time. The cinematography is beautiful, the writing is moody and matches the time period, the music is amazing (probably my favourite part) and the young leading actress Anya Taylor-Joy was incredible in her role as Thomasin.I liked it a lot, but it didn't scare me. I won't be having nightmares because of this film, and that is slightly disappointing. If you're able to appreciate this film for its story, watch it, but if you're looking for a movie to scare you out of your skin, this isn't it, unless you're afraid of Christian fundamentalism and/or naked old women.",8,1,6,31 March 2016
Sausage Party," Prioritizes Crude Humour Over Plot, But Does Crude Humour Well.
","Sausage Party is a prime example of doing Crude Humour right, in that it's not necessarily the jokes themselves that are funny, but the source of said jokes. The creators were onto something when they decided using food and condiments as the characters, as due to this separation from reality, the creators could get away with creating one of the most incredibly sexual, crude, violent and drug fuelled comedies I've ever seen, all with just an R-Rating. The crudeness of humour, while different stylistically, is definitely on par with films like Team America or the South Park film, perhaps even more so.My main issue with this film is the plot structure. The first trailer to this film (the one that first drew my attention) is structured very differently from the final product. The trailer implied a sudden and almost unexpected ramp from kid-friendly romp to food-related horror. However, the film showed us the violence and sexual innuendos from the get go, making the scene from the trailer less impactful and shocking than it could have been.The film also relies heavily on racial stereotypes. I personally don't mind this in particular, at least within this film's context, but it's something to keep in mind. Each respective food-type represent a very stereotypical member of the culture of origin (Taco=Mexican, Bagel=Jew, etc.). This film is very irreverent and unforgiving in this regard, so if you are particularly sensitive to such subjects, you won't like this film.I personally also had a problem with a couple of scenes that could be interpreted as 'rape'scenes. These scenes aren't particularly made fun of, but the mere fact that its food and condiments that are doing these things makes it perhaps less serious on the get-go than it should be.Overall this is a really good comedy, and I enjoyed watching it. However, it's a film that is deliberately trying to offend your sensibilities, and it won't pull any punches. Take that as you will.",7,17,37,11 August 2016
It Chapter Two," Nowhere near as good as the first, but still has a lot of good stuff
","Probably the best and most horrific moment in this movie is the opening, where the gay couple gets brutally attacked, one of them being thrown over a bridge into the river only to be eaten by Pennywise. That scene is horrifying and great, and the closest we get in this film to the Georgie scene from the first film.After that great opener, the film doesn't seem to know what to do.I haven't read much of the book, but from what I've heard, the Adult scenes in the book are not the main focus of the story, and the child sequences are given a lot more development. Which makes sense, as the story is about overcoming childhood trauma and how trauma impacts you years after you grew up. However, when the films were originally pitched where the first film is about the kids, and the second film is about the adults coming back, I think the screenwriters weren't quite prepared for how much of an undertaking that would be.The movie rushes through the intro scenes where we see where the adult Loser's Club ends up, seemingly in a rush to get them all back to Derry and have more Pennywise shenanigans, but when they all get there, the film turns into a fetch quest, where each of them has to retrieve an object from their past to sacrifice in a 'Ritual of Chud' in order to defeat IT once and for all. This fetch quest takes up most of the almost 3 hour movie, before a 1/2 hour climax in the sewers.During each character's mini adventure, it cuts between a previously unseen scene from their childhood (ie, a newly filmed scene with the kid actors between their breakup and reunification to save Beverley) and a scene with the adult versions coming across a similar scare. These scenes range in quality, my personal favourite being Beverley's scene that was mostly shown in the teaser trailer a few months back. Save for the ending where the creepy grandma turns into a CGI monster that isn't scary at all. Bill's mini adventure is also decent, and the longest, as he meets a young boy who reminds him of Georgie, and attempts to save him from Pennywise. The other scenes are either okay or completely forgettable.Speaking of forgettable, the bully Henry Bowers, who kills his dad and attempts to kill the Losers in the first film, comes back after breaking out of a mental asylum. I thought he would be a bigger secondary antagonist then he ended up being, because after stabbing a couple of people in non-fatal areas, he ends up dying rather quickly after being introduced. A wasted opportunity for sure, not to mention why Pennywise needed his help in the first place? Who knows.Finally, the climax, where Pennywise reveals its true form. In the book, It's described as a giant spider, which the original 1990's miniseries attempted to do with mixed results. For some reason, though, the film instead made Pennywise's true form a Spider-centaur, where IT still looks like a clown on the top half, but has long spider legs on his body. I guess they wanted to keep Bill Skarsgard's great performance as IT and not overshadow him with a CGI spider, but again, it's a missed opportunity to just go crazy with a really fun design for ITs final form.Overall, this film has several missed opportunities, but there are definitely things that are worth praising. The casting of the adult versions of the kid characters was incredible. All of them look great and act the roles well. The acting overall was incredible, and if casting directors could get Academy Awards, they would get all of them for this film. There were still quite a good few horror moments, and a few good laughs.As good as the first? Not at all, but a good bit of fun in the cinema? absolutely.",7,1,1,10 September 2019
Mother!," A Film Expressing Interesting Ideas, if Nothing Else
","As I scroll through the reviews of this film, what I'm getting a sense of is that people don't like the movie because it's gross, weird, shocking and controversial. If you think those traits a bad movie make, I don't know what to tell you. There is a massive legacy in film history of people making weird gross controversial films that are loved by critics and film snobs, as it were, but not the masses. mother! is definitely one of those films, a film that is going to go down in history as a cult classic.I think everyone knows at this point what the movie is about. It's allegory from start to finish. It's Biblical allegory, like Pilgrim's Progress, but unlike that story, mother! is very anti-bible and anti-god. Darren Aronofsky is a Jewish Atheist, so much of his work is centred around a very critical view of the Bible. We saw this before with his big-budget adaptation of Noah (which I also like, so you can sort of see why I would like this as well)In this film, Aronofsky frames God (known in the film as 'Him' or 'The poet') as a blathering idiot who is so caught up in his own legacy that he ignores the constant pleas of his wife, known as 'mother', played by Jennifer Lawrence. Mother, or Mother Nature's sole purpose is to protect what is hers. She desires to live alone with her husband the poet, but He denies her that right, and invites unwanted guests in again and again, who bring nothing but arrogance and destruction to her house, representing humanity's arrogance and wanton destruction of the world and environment.At several points in the later half of the film, the unwanted guests say that the 'home' is everyones and that they should share the home. This parallels a real life phenomenon of many people using religion as a justification for their greed and exploitation of the world's resources.There is a lot to think about in this film, and I think it's worth discussing as to what the story is trying to say about our world, our relationship to God (whether real or not) and how we use religion to justify atrocities.However, I wouldn't say this film is perfect. I think it does get caught up in itself sometimes, and there are some weird contrivances within the story that muddles up the allegory. The presence of a phone that can call 911, especially, doesn't make sense. What do the police represent in this allegory? It's hard to tell. What is ridiculous, though, is that this film was nominated for several Razzies (worst director, worst actress, and worst supporting actor) which is entirely perplexing because the acting and directing aren't what makes this film 'bad' in any respect. People who have issues with this film have issues with the writing, so if you want to say something in this film deserves a Razzie, make it worst writer (although I don't think that's a category in the Razzies, which would explain a lot)This film isn't for everyone, and I respect that. People should understand though that just because a film isn't for them doesn't mean it's bad. You have to think of something more concrete to explain why something is bad beyond you simply not liking it or thinking it's gross and controversial.",7,1,2,21 May 2018
The Greatest Showman," An Immensely entertaining, if unfocused, musical
","I can easily imagine this film being an issue for some people. It takes a controversial historical figure, and invents an almost entirely fictional version of his life that portrays him not as the flawed capitalist who exploited people to make his riches that he was in real life, but as a passionate entertainer that gives the 'freaks' in his show an opportunity to express themselves.Also, the music is very separated from the tone and the setting of the story itself. The film is set in the mid 1800's, but all of the music is post-2010's pop anthems. Every song feels out of place within a true historical world, and most of the music feels more like Top 40 stuff you hear on the radio.But...I still like it. It's fun. It's really fun. It's a movie motivated not by plot or history or character, but by pure emotion. The music especially portrays this incredibly well. Songs like Rewrite the Stars, The Other Side and For Now On are just fun to watch and listen to.If you don't like the music, there's nothing for you here. This movie is kinda bad when you separate it from the music, but hey, let's just call this film a not-guilty guilty pleasure of mine. It's just fun.",7,0,3,2 April 2018
Lucy," An Entertaining Film based around a Preposterous Premise
","This film is about a woman turning herself into God.Really. According to Luc Besson, 100% Cerebral capacity=Omniscience. At the end of the film, after transforming from a naive young woman, to a telekinetic, to a telepathic, to a ultra-computer, she disappears, gives all her knowledge to Morgan Freeman (in the form of a Universe USB) and achieves ascension.It's crazy, stupid, but altogether fun and visually engaging.From what I've seen, Luc Besson is quite a master of visual appeal, and its no different here. The film is also quite diverse. The villains are a gang of Triad drug dealers, and the film is mainly set in Europe and Taiwan.The 10% idea is a complete fallacy, but the script runs with it, caring not for legitimate science, and makes the movie they want to make.My main gripe with the film is the dialog. Luc Besson is French, and it seems rather apparent from his writing (he wrote and directed this film) that English isn't his forte. Scarlett Johanneson does wonders with the script though, especially at the beginning, where she is practically a different character then what she is at the end. She loses a lot of emotion throughout the film as her ascension progresses, but I think her character arc excuses that.In conclusion, Lucy is an entertaining film that's worth watching, perhaps with your brain at 10%.",8,3,9,22 November 2014
V for Vendetta," My Personal Favourite Movie of All Time
","It's been quite a few years since I first saw V for Vendetta. I didn't see it at release, because I was far under the age demographic at that time, but I managed to catch up to the film at around 2011-2012. Not sure the exact year, but I was a teenager at the time, and I loved the Matrix (still do), and heard that V for Vendetta was written by the Wachowskis, so I thought I'd give it a shot.It blew me away in many ways, and I credit the film as being part of the reason I became less homophobic and bigoted in many ways. It was the first time I saw homosexuality in a direct and positive light in the media, and it helped me immensely in establishing my more left-leaning views in the Christian world I was raised in.It's for this reason I have a very deep and personal relationship with this film, but I love the film at a more enjoyable level as well. This film oozes with style. Everything from the cinematography and sound design, to the ways characters speak and act. The rather sparse use of fight scenes (in comparison to other action films of its ilk), opting rather to use political thriller tropes and character development, surprised me the first time I watched it, but even though the film wasn't as action packed as films like The Matrix or Equilibrium (both of which have massive third act spectacles) the action I feel is much more effective and emotional than either of those films (ironic, since Equilibrium is about emotion). While short, the final fight scene between V and Creedy's men is an incredible burst of ecstatic visceral action that makes the entire film worth it.You can say there are three main characters in this film. There's V, the titular anarchist vigilante, Evey, the young woman who is kidnapped, and slowly falls for V in a more violent twist of Beauty and the Beast, and there's Detective Finch, a government employee tasked to finding and unmasking V, and during this task discovering that his beloved government isn't as noble as it may seem. Each of these characters is given a fair and due amount of screen time, and they each have a full and satisfactory character arc. I find how well written and edited this film is to be incredibly impressive, and writing this I want to watch the film all over again just to appreciate it more.There is something to be said, however, about the differences between the film and the original graphic novel written by Alan Moore. I haven't read the original comic, but judging by Alan Moore's distaste of films inspired by his work, and the fact that he refused to watch the film after reading the script, maybe this film isn't for fans of the original work. There's a great comparison video by CineFix on Youtube comparing the film to the novel, and they are very very different from each other. One notable difference is that the portrayal of V vs the dictator Sutler is much more nuanced and less Black and white in the novel than in the film, and that is a very well deserved critique of the film. I do not claim that V for Vendetta is the best film ever made. I haven't even scraped the surface of world cinema and cinema history to ever make that claim. However I can definitely say that V for Vendetta is, at least for the time being, the most personally meaningful movie, and the most enjoyable movie, I have ever seen. Mad Max Fury Road did get close though.",10,63,74,31 October 2016
