The Blair Witch Project," Ehh...
","This movie wasn't as scary as I thought it was going to be.  I thought they could have set up the legend of the Blair Witch better than they did.  I thought the filming techniques they used were great - the whole 'home movie' camcorder thing was interesting.  However, there are only so many shots of trees I can stand.  I thought the emotion was very real, but a lot of the story was confusing.  (The rocks and stick figures they found in the woods - what was the meaning?)  The ending shot was fabulous!  I really liked the abrupt ending.  See the movie because it's interesting, but don't expect to be scared out of your wits.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Final Masterpeice is Flawless
","Stanley Kubrick's final film, EYES WIDE SHUT, is a breathtaking story of a marriage plagued by jealousy and a husband seeking revenge.  Tom Cruise shines in his brillant potrayal of Dr. Bil Harford as he searches for answers in a haze of sexual confusion.  Nicole Kidman plays his wife in heartbreaking scenes where she tells Cruise of her fantasies of another man. Some scenes will haunt you, such as the well-publicized orgy scene.  Every moment is flawless.  The acting is fabulous, the scenes are eerie, and you find yourself delving whole-heartedly into the escapades of Harford. EYES WIDE SHUT is characteristically Kubrick, and his final movie is just as good, if not better, than its predecessors.",10,1,2,17 July 1999
