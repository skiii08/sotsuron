Blade Runner 2049," Way too long!
","As someone who hasn't watched the first movie, I feel like I can (in a way) be more lenient on my score. Or at least that's what I was led to believe since a lot of people I know (and don't know) mention the first movie was a great watch. Blade Runner 2049, not so muchI really liked a lot of the things this movie did on an individual level, like the concept of this world, the visuals, the soundtrack to a certain degree, and even some of the questions it poses (what does it mean to be human?). However, you add everything together and things start to get a little shaky. Our main plot for this movie seems to be searching for the child of a now dead replicant, which shouldn't even be possible since replicants aren't technically human, and to erase themI suppose the biggest thing this movie suffers from isn't content because just these few things have me interested, or even visuals because some of the stuff we see is amazing, but length. This is nearly a 3 hour movie (2h 44m) and I don't think it needs to be this long. There are moments that I think could have either been cut (since it's all just pretty scenes) or moved along quicker. The topic of being human is also only brought up at the beginning but it ends up not amounting to anything in the long run. In terms of characters it was very hard for me to truly care for anyone because they just felt so bland to me (I know they're replicants but come on). I did however, really like Luv and how passionate she was (plus that girl knows how to fight!)I would only recommend this if you have time to spare. I'd probably also wait until it wasn't in theaters anymore",6,6,12,21 October 2017
It," Enjoyable watch, Not very scary
","Another movie that was being hyped!! I just had to go check it out even though horror movies aren't my thing. Lucky for me, this movie ended up being less horror and more drama/character drivenIn IT we start off with your typical horror-esque situation with the kids going to the scary basement, all the lights are off, mother is playing creepy piano music, and there's a clown in the sewers. It's everything you see in the trailers and everything everyone is raving about. But then we fast forward a month and we're dropped into a completely different mood. Instead of scary we are now in a middle school setting following the Losers club as they spend their summer doing kind of dangerous things but also fun stuffIn a way this is where the movie could get boring if you walk into this thinking you're going to be scared. The scariest part happens in the first few minutes of the film and from there it's mostly us getting to know these kids and by the way, there's a killer clown on the looseThis had a very Jeepers Creepers feel + facing your fearsOverall I really did enjoy this movie to the point where I was okay seeing it twice. (By the way, if anyone is going to watch this I recommend it in Dolby. Really makes the experience different). I don't know what the original was like and I haven't gotten around to reading the book but because of the title, I feel like Pennywise was supposed to be more of the focus of the movie, except he wasn't. In a way, he was like an afterthought but I didn't mind. I liked him as the representation of fear and how each character went about overcoming their fears. I am curious about how the sequel will be presented and when it will be done",8,3,5,30 September 2017
Baby Driver," Surprised I enjoyed this so much!
","I really enjoyed watching this movie. I'm a huge fan of car racing type shows and even though this isn't technically one, Baby does car race against the cops. I loved Baby's character and how he was portrayed and his little music making quirks. In terms of cute couples, I feel like part of me want to give the trophy to Baby and Deborah but there was just something so passionate about Buddy and Darling (I mean, that guy went nuts when she went down)The story was really nice. Nothing complex, no surprising plot twist at the end, or original, but there was something about the atmosphere of it that really made it feel unique. Extra points for the soundtrack. I'm not a huge oldies person but I really liked the songs that were picked out for this movie and how they were integrated into the story. Also the disabilities of the characters was interesting and I liked that they weren't used as weaknesses but strengths (and not even that, it was just another part of who they were)Wouldn't dub this movie one of my favorites but I do recommend checking it out",8,7,14,30 July 2017
Dunkirk," Something is missing...
","I think a 9/10 suits this movie even though I can't call it a favorite of mineI decided to check this movie out because it was about a war and the idea of citizens helping out soldiers was interesting to me. However, as soon as I sat in that theatre I was confused. What exactly was the story here? We ended up following a couple people in the movie but none of them could really be called 'the protagonist'. Add to that the point of the movie didn't feel like it was to entertain us, instead it felt like it was trying to say 'this is one of those things that happened at the time, these are the things people did in order to survive, to try and get home' and so forthAside from that I really formed an attachment to certain characters and was SO SAD to see them die. The sounds and panning made it all feel very suspenseful and it added to my feelings for the events and charactersEnjoyed it even though it's a much slower and different kind of movie I watch",9,2,8,30 July 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Tried to cram too much into one movie but a decent watch
","One of the more obvious reasons I wanted to watch this movie was that I'd been watching all the (more recent) Harry Potter movies in theaters and this was, in a way, a Harry Potter movie, so I felt an obligation to myself to go and see this. Another was that the setting was in America. While location was never a concern for me, because magical word, who cares? just saying this was going to happen in America got me curious. Would it be different? How? Would we see some of the people from the HP series when they were younger?! (You have no idea how much I need this)In a way we did get slight mentions of Dumbledore and Hogwarts, but they were never really the focus of the movie. The one character that did overlap both worlds, however, was Grindelwald. I won't really go into too much detail here because that would mean SPOILERS and honestly, I hadn't known about him until this movie.In terms of human characters, I was rather disappointed. We have our main protagonist, Newt Scamander who has a bunch of nearly extinct creatures in his suitcase, is studying them, and is trying to get one to Arizona, its natural habitat. But other than this quirky habit of caring for them and doing strange mating rituals, there's not much else to him. Yes, he's brave, yes he's got some connection to Dumbledore, but not much else.Even his suitcase had more personality /sigh/We also meet Tina who is part of the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) and the one who ends up arresting Newt when he first arrives in NY (his niffler escapes and causes mayhem!). Of course, her arresting him and taking him in clue us in that she's been demoted and is no longer supposed to be arresting wizards (for some reason). Instead of letting Newt go, she becomes his shadow and 'helps' him recover his suitcase, which had been taken by a No-maj (muggle) who mistook it for his.I initially didn't care much for her because she was just doing her job, but as the movie progresses she becomes more annoying. I also felt it was harder to connect with her because she was the more selfish of the characters. All her actions were less because she was worried about exposure and more about trying to get promoted/recognition. Even at the end, when she had a change in character, I still didn't like her because her change came from self-preservation.Then we have Jacob Kowalski (aspiring baker) and Tina's sister and roommate, Queenie Goldstein. Jacob is the no-maj who just happened to be at the wrong place when Newt's niffler causes mayhem in NY. I think I was particularly attracted to Jacob's character because he was a no-maj and was just so fascinated by the magical creatures. He helped out Newt care for them in the suitcase, he got chased by a huge Erumpent that wanted to mate with him, and still didn't freak out because technically this stuff isn't supposed to exist, right?And then we have Queenie, who seems to be pretty lady of the series. She looks good and knows how to use that charm to her advantage! She is also well versed in legilimency, a sort of mind-reading ability, which I absolutely loved. I actually didn't think she'd be a main character but she surprised me in actually taking action (unlike someone else in this movie)Just going to say that near the end she has a scene with Jacob that legit broke my heart.Overall I think the movie was OK. It really tried to cram so many ideas into a 2 hour (ish) film, which I felt was its biggest downfall. I mean, the majority of the movie was spent finding the creatures that had escaped Newt's bag, which I felt should have been enough for the one movie. But then they had to add the whole exposure aspect, which was less detailed and more rushed.",7,0,0,30 September 2017
Logan," One of The Best Movies I've Seen In Theatres So Far
","I ended up watching this movie at the insistence of my brother and I'm super glad I did. I feel like I usually think a movie is OK but this one was really good! Worth the $15+ I spentI didn't grow up with these movies and I haven't watched any of the wolverine ones, so I had a lot of questions while watching this. It's probably also because of this that the ending didn't hit me as much as it did others. There were a lot of good fight scenes where I didn't know who the real winner would be, and I LOVED how Logan wasn't your typical good guy. Yes he was a good guy but he was also selfish, didn't think twice about killing others, and didn't care if you were an old man or a little girl (he treated everyone nearly the same)I especially loved all of Laura's fight scenes. There was something really visceral about them. I'm curious how things in this world will pan out with her as the next main character of the series",9,4,10,11 May 2017
Wonder Woman," A Good Watch, But No For the Gender Rep
","I managed to go and check out Wonder Woman soon after it came out and I'm having mixed feelings about it. Part of me likes it, part of me isn't too convinced about the ending and the ending is really important in helping me figure out if I like a movie, and another part is saying, 'well what did you expect from a superhero movie?'If the scene had action in it, I really liked it. I think my favorite parts so far were at the beginning where the Amazons fought the Germans, and when Diana is at No Man's Land (the part we see in the previews). I really liked how Chris Pine portrayed Steve Trevor. It was really simple but there was something really charismatic about him. It was enough for you to notice that he was one of the main characters but not enough that Diana was pushed to the back. As for Gal Gadot's acting, I liked it. I'm a fan of hers and she didn't disappoint this time either. Aside from action packed scenes, the movie also had some funny moments during the down times. So why wasn't I feeling this movie? Spoilers start here!At the end of the movie Diana ends up killing Ludendorff because she thinks he's Ares. Throughout the movie she'd been going on and on about her duty to stop him but when she does kill him nothing happens. The war continues and she's left confused. We later learn that Ludendorff wasn't actually Ares but the part that bugs me is that it takes Steve Trevor for her to understand and to take certain action. Not to mention the mini-tantrum she had because she was wrong. 'What there's a bunch of dangerous gas out there that can wipe out millions and you need my help? Uhm no thanks, let me sulk here because I was wrong'It's only after Steve talks to her and (basically) tells her that humans have an inner evil that she starts to understand. It's only after Steve blows himself up that she finally loses control and it's only after she remembers what he tells her (that he loves her) that she finally understands that humans are evil but that they are also capable of love. That love is the answer. It almost makes it seem like she didn't know what love was until Steve Trevor came into her life...This might not seem like much but considering this movie is supposed to be about Wonder Woman, one of the few female superheroes, I was expecting something more. Something better. But Diana starts off as a naive girl, ignorant about the world and then she meets a man, can finally see the world because this man gave her the excuse to leave, and finally understands human nature thanks to said manI usually don't care about representation but that's one of the reasons this movie was supposed to be such a good watch and it wasn't for me on that end. It was a good watch because it had good action, but other than that, it's your typical PG-13 superhero movie. I gave it a 7/10 because I liked the action and because Gal Gadot was pretty cool",7,0,4,8 June 2017
Mother!," Great if you get it, Not so much if you don't
","I decided to check this movie out because we got it at my job but I went in thinking this was some horror film and found I was very much mistaken. I would probably call this a thriller or even a psychological one because this got under my skin like no other movie has ever done so! It's creepy and strange but also mysteriously good?Still, at the moment I can't really say much more about the film because I don't get it. On the surface there's people who destroy Mother's (apparently that's her name) home and after some time she just can't take it anymore, even when her husband preaches about forgiving people. But on another level, there's some symbolism relating to the bible and the Earth/world going on that I think ended up being too vague for general audiences, which is the majority of people who watch moviesI think this would be perfect for a school essay where one gets some clues about what the movie is about, and I would only recommend this movie to someone who has done a bit of research on the symbolism of the movie or someone who is open minded about reading between the lines",7,1,6,30 September 2017
