Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The foundation for things to come...
","This movie ROCKS!! Don't let the critics detract from your experience. There *IS* a plot, there *ARE* characters who develop somewhat. Sure, it may be one long 'trailer' for the next two, but it it certainly a good starting point for the new trilogy. Critics make it out to be something that is weak and thin in plot & development, but you have to know Star Wars enough to really appreciate what's going on. Look past the special effects and you can see where Lucas is going to take this thing.It may not be the best episode in the slate, but it doesn't have to be. It gets things going. You find that there's more to this episode than meets the eye. You have to see it a couple of times to fully appreciate the details. Some people may criticize it for not having certain characters like a Han Solo for instance. But they're baseless critiques. It doesn't have to have such things that the original trilogy had. It's a totally new trilogy that makes sense once you accept it for what it is.Just remember, the critics say what they say so that you can make a choice about what new, unknown movies to see. But since we know what we are dealing with, we don't need them to tell us whether or not to go. We know what we're in for. Embrace it. And enjoy... :)",Null,0,0,20 May 1999
