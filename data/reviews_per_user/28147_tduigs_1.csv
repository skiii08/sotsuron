Moneyball," Good Movie, misses some important points about the '02 A's
","I enjoyed the movie and I would recommended it to others to see. Good enough to go to the theatre and not wait for the DVD. Brad Pitt does a good job of making Billy Beane into a likable guy.Two problems: 1. Movie ignores that they had three stud young pitchers, that were the true reason for the 20 game winning streak in '02; 2. The movie tries to create the perception that David Justice was picked from the Yankee's junk heep because they did not realize he had value for his ability to get on base. Brad Pitt confronts Justice and makes a statement, that 'New York' is paying 1/2 his salary not to be there (it is made to seem that 'New York' was the 'Yankees.') In reality, the Yankees had traded Justice to the Mets for Ventura, and their salaries were a wash, so no money changed.But it was a good movie!",Null,1,1,3 October 2011
