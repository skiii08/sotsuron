Blade Runner 2049," You Really Need To See This One In The Theaters
","If you wait to see this at home, you're really going to miss out on the full experience. You need to see this someplace where you can crank the sound with big sub woofers, along with a screen that does well with low light situations. The film is lit very darkly and the outdoor shots are often in rain or overcast skies. The director uses musical base notes to create a constant droning thunder that continues throughout the entire movie. This movie is worth seeing just for the cinematography alone. The story is great, but the movie is like a constantly changing work of art. It really is in a class of its own. I highly recommend it.",10,2,8,10 October 2017
