Frost_Nixon," Masterful interpretation
","When actors are asked to play real people in films, the results can be mixed. In this case however, Michael Sheen and Frank Langella produce two of the best performances as real historical characters that I have ever seen on film.Langella's Nixon is brilliant - I had been concerned that he didn't look enough like him, or that he was too tall etc. but all that becomes secondary as he breathes such compelling life into this controversial character. And I found Sheen's Frost to be absolutely pitch perfect, so much so that I was never distracted by thoughts of a misplaced vocal quirk or gesture. His performance as Tony Blair in 'The Queen' was similarly accurate and I await his portrayal of Brian Clough in 'The Damned United' with baited breath.But aside from the performances, the massive strength of the film is its ability to find balance and harmony with the characters, and the marvellous way in which a film simply about a political interview is made gripping for two hours (and could easily have been longer). Both men are presented at times as troubled, careless and flawed but also funny, generous and steeped in integrity in equal measure. There are times when we see Nixon as a money-obsessed bigot, and other times when he is a contrite and courageous soul. Similarly, we see Frost both as a happy-go-lucky playboy and as a feckless, unreliable showbiz type. Our minds are not made up for us as to which of these is the more accurate portrayal of each character.The supporting cast is largely excellent with the glamorous Rebecca Hall well-cast as Caroline Cushing, and Oliver Platt and Sam Rockwell as Frost's colleagues. I found the only slight mis-step to be Matthew Macfadyen's John Birt, whose stuffy English producer role was rather unlikeable and tended to add little to the scenes he featured in. However, Kevin Bacon's loyal-as-a-dog aide to Nixon is always interesting.Even if you are familiar with the story and the interview, the film is always tense. The interview scenes are unbelievably so, even at the times when you are only seeing the expressions on the faces of the protagonists. As it reaches its climax, it is impossible not to feel a heady mix of emotions toward both men, not to mention feel somewhat drained at its climax.Whilst I would say an interest in politics would help in watching this film, I would also say that anyone who simply appreciates brilliant acting and wonderfully scripted exchanges should make an effort to see Frost/Nixon. You are not likely to be disappointed.",8,3,5,30 January 2009
Alexander," Not the film it should have been
","I have to say that I was really quite alarmed, not to mention disappointed, at how poor this film generally was. It would have worked better as an epic, historical action film which examines the true character of the film's main figure. However, Oliver Stone attempted to incorporate several confusing, drawn out personal incidents and strained relationships into the film, with the incidental backdrop of war and the conquering of enormous countries. As a result, Stone essentially neglects to tell the story of how Alexander came to be such an all-conquering warrior, and gives the illusion that his conquests were made simply by turning up.One of the main issues with the film is that the central characters - despite their lengthy screen time and the numerous incidents each is embroiled in - are never stripped bare for the viewer for long enough for them to be more than two dimensional. For example, Alexander's volatile relationship with his father is baffling throughout the movie, swinging as it does between mutual affection and abject hatred. Similarly, it is never explained fully as to why his mother is quite so scheming and harbours so much anger towards his father.All these things aside, the true problem with the film is the standard of the acting. Being a high-strung drama, it requires performances that are sincere whilst also not patronising or over-cooking it for the viewer. Unfortunately, the film does not possess a single strong performance. Colin Farrell is uncomfortable, if willing, in the lead role, a fact not helped by the Director's decision to make Alexander's male friends and generals speak with Northern Irish accents so as not to draw attention to Farrell's own accent. Val Kilmer is hackneyed and perhaps mis-cast as Alexander's father, and Angelina Jolie's performance as Farrell's mother is bordering on the catastrophic. Despite her wicked beauty, she demonstrates that she has neither the versatility nor earnestness to act at this level.Finally, the simple presentation of the movie is flawed. The opening scenes, which show Anthony Hopkins in one of his more pointless roles, are set against a computer-generated backdrop which could not have looked less real had it been a charcoal drawing. Later scenes, whilst expensively produced, give the impression, perhaps deliberately, of theatrical stage scenery. If this is intended, then it is negated by the lengthy scenes outdoors, which again feature unwelcome CGI.On the whole, the film is actually rather dull. It does not present its subject matter with sufficient power to hold the viewer's interest and the 2 hours, 30 mins running time leaves you longing for an end. The one scene that is worth seeing is one in which Alexander and his horse square up to an Indian soldier on an elephant. Unusually for the film, it is beautifully shot and wonderfully engaging. But it lasts only a few seconds.",3,5,6,6 August 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Unexpectedly important
","I resisted watching this film for a long time. The media hype it received over what I perceived to be hackneyed subject matter was off-putting and the raving over two young actors acting out a forbidden love story was something I felt I could do without.I'm somewhat ashamed to say the death of Heath Ledger is what forced me to take the plunge. I had to see what all the fuss was about. Still, I approached it with trepidation, haunted by phrases such as 'the most important film for years' which seem to be applied to anything that can be construed as left wing these days.Thie first 30 minutes or so left me uncomfortable. I guess, like many people, I was afraid of the graphic portrayal of the two men's relationship and didn't know how I would react to the first signs of it. And yes, I did find it tough to start with. But I soon realised that the reason for that was due to the characters I was watching, and the fact that neither knew how or why it was happening, and would never have considered this kind of union in their normal lives. Ledger's character, particularly, is a massively introverted and silent soul who cannot process the feelings that the relationship generates.The rest of the film is simply a study of isolation and deeply-stored feelings that are universally understandable. I had been concerned, prior to seeing the film, that its premise would be absurd and there would be an impossible depiction of two queens living it up in secret amongst dour cattlemen. But what the film portrays is far more real, a confused mesh of feelings and hopes, and the fierce and brutal opposition to it that lurks continuously.So having seen it, I can agree that this film is important. It's important because it doesn't particularly say one thing or another. It's not a wail against homophobia, it's not staunchly against the social politics of the American South, it's not a protest for freedom and understanding. It's just a story. And a brilliantly delivered one at that.RIP Heath Ledger.",8,14,16,13 February 2008
Terminator Salvation," Some great effects, but this isn't Terminator
","As someone who is a big fan of the first two films and certainly not disparaging of the third, naturally I was looking forward to the fourth instalment in the Terminator series. Of course, I had my reservations when I saw it was to be directed by someone with a made-up name whose greatest achievement to date was the Charlie's Angels films, and that the key catalyst of the previous three (Arnold Schwarzenegger) would not feature. And, it seems, those reservations were well founded.Firstly, let's get some things clear: I like Christian Bale a lot and think he is a superb actor. I also think some of the special effects/CGI in this film are as good as I've seen. And I think the film-makers have been very creative with some of the variances of Terminators and Hunter Killers on show. However, for some reason, Terminator Salvation is scripted as some kind of brain-dead action flick rather than the intriguing science fiction which is prevalent in the first three. Character development is pretty much ditched in favour of cheap story links and lame references to the existing franchise, while the action sequences, whilst entertaining, are rarely fully explained and often interrupt any semblance of plot which might be developing.Bale himself is intense and tough as the iconic John Connor, but we are told very little about how he went from hiding in a Presidential bunker with Kate Brewster in Terminator 3 to being the god-like leader of the resistance. Speaking of which, the character of Brewster is developed even less, and is purely used as a very superficial love interest for Bale. Similarly confusing is the portrayal of Kyle Reese, here depicted as a scrawny street dweller with a small, mute black child as a sidekick (presumably for tokenism, he has no relevancy to the film whatsoever). Again, we have no real idea how this character became the Kyle Reese we see in the first film, which is surely one of the main objectives of Terminator Salvation - or it should be.And then there is the character of Marcus Wright, who is essentially the lead role. We see at the beginning of the film that he donated his body to Cyberdyne Systems for research and was eventually re-invented as a prototype for a new type of Terminator. Wright believes himself to be human however - a twist that is never fully explained - and this creates much conflict between himself, the resistance and the enemy Skynet. Whilst it's a reasonable idea, it simply isn't interesting enough to carry the film, and the ludicrous relationship that develops between Wright and a female member of the resistance is alarmingly cheesy.With regards to the effects, some of these are truly awe-inspiring - particularly a helicopter crash that Bale suffers near the start of the film, and some of the battle scenes involving enormous Hunter Killers. There is a flaw though in the way that the Terminators themselves are depicted. The androids that roam the streets picking off members of the resistance are certainly frightening enough, but do not resemble the T-600 models described by Kyle Reese in the first film, an error which I expect is deliberate to make the newly developed T-800 models (Schwarzenegger's character from the previous films) appear far more advanced and threatening.But the main problem with this film is that it is not, in any real sense, a Terminator film. All the previous three were synonymous with a chase element, and the near misses that went with it. There is none of that in this film, and it appears as almost a snapshot of the war with Skynet, rather than the beginning or end. Pretty much all the previous threads and possibilities that were created in the franchise have been done away with and a banal plot, a poor script and a frankly nauseating finish have been thrown together together to make an action film for the masses, rather than a satisfactory new chapter for the fans.",5,2,6,20 June 2009
Kick-Ass," Enjoyable, but lacks balance
","For a film that has received so many rave reviews and seems to appeal to varying audiences, I was surprised I didn't like Kick-Ass more. It has comedy, drama, action and some great visuals, but it feels that there is not enough of a balance struck between these aspects to make the film truly excel.Still, it is fun and pretty enjoyable. The story concerns an average kid (Aaron Johnson) attempting to become a superhero with no idea how to achieve this and the ensuing adventures that take in a notorious mobster, his son and two genuine superheroes, amongst others. The film is angled as a kind of black comedy superhero caper, which is admittedly original, but it seems to compromise on the comedy which doesn't really suit the film's premise. At times, the drama is far too overbearing and serious for a film concerning a bungling superhero.On the subject of the comedy, one feels it relies too much on shocking visual moments than on sharp scripting - the amusing casual banter in the vein of Superbad etc. that you might expect is not strong enough and the film never delivers the one-liner laughs that it intends or threatens to. Many of the laughs come from Hit-Girl, a school-age superhero who has been trained by her father, Nicolas Cage, in the arts of self-defence and weaponry. Her foul-mouthed and ultra-violent killing sprees are funny and impressively showcased, but one feels too much emphasis is placed on the Hit-Girl 'shock factor' at times.The reason given for Hit-Girl and Big Daddy (Cage's super alter-ego) becoming superheroes is flimsy at best, and a rather odd scene where their crime-fighting is blamed on Cage's character being framed in the past and his wife dying while he served the resulting jail sentence is a fairly lazy and unoriginal plot device which doesn't add the spice it perhaps could. Speaking of lazy plot devices, we are subjected to a pretty lame, slow-burning love interest for Johnson's character which doesn't really add much and, if anything, implodes the idea that he is a talentless loser, one of the main aspects of the basic story.It's not that Kick-Ass is a bad film - it's actually entertaining for the most part and certainly not formulaic or predictable. And whilst it's somewhat of a letdown on the comedy front, it's not unfunny. And the action and visuals are as good as they could be. It just seems to lose its way between trying to be a gross-out teen comedy and a dark, violent comic book thriller. At times this makes it pretty uncomfortable to watch, which one feels is unnecessary for something so apparently light-hearted.Still, there's a lot here for audiences to enjoy - albeit more for the Kill Bill/Sin City crowds than the more general audience at which it appears to be aimed.",7,3,11,12 April 2010
The Hurt Locker," The Dramatic But Ultimately Confusing Locker
","Like most people, I chose to watch The Hurt Locker off the back of its pretty sizeable hype and because of the awards the film was showered with in early 2010. To be honest, I was expecting it to be pretty hard-going, gritty, shaky-camera-and-battle-scene-heavy stuff, not to mention dripping in political posturing. However, the film is not really any of these things and, for several reasons, is actually very average.The first thing you notice about The Hurt Locker is that it doesn't actually have a recognisable story. I'm sure this is deliberate to a degree, but it is clear that failed attempts have been made to involve the viewer in the characters. Some fairly tepid dialogue and run-of-the-mill-TV-drama performances contribute greatly to this, and give the film a feel of something less than an award-winner. In fact, some of the tense and dramatic scenes in the film are very well engineered and look great – but the fact I didn't care much about the characters involved made the outcome of these sequences less important.Other reviewers have noted that the film jumps around from dead-end storyline to dead-end storyline with no explanation. This is true. There is absolutely no reason for most of the diversions the film takes, and to be honest they're not even that interesting, both due to the lack of character development and their hackneyed tone. For example, a selection of scenes towards the end of the film when one of the main characters returns home to find he cannot connect with everyday life as he once did is both utterly pointless and completely unoriginal as a plot device and social message.Overall, it is pretty obvious why this film has been rated highest on IMDb by the younger demographic. There is a good amount of action and plenty of visual drama for those less likely to be concerned with plot holes and phoned-in performances. For those of us who are more discerning however, this film lacks an awful lot and it is hard to see how it can have won the Oscar for Best Picture. Sound and editing? Fine. Screenplay? That's pushing it. Direction? Questionable at best. Best Picture? Definitely not.That said, all of the above were better than in Avatar, which is possibly why The Hurt Locker did win. Still, Kathryn Bigelow must have some friends in high places to have achieved what she did with this, a fairly routine yet oddly disjointed effort.",5,0,2,16 June 2010
Green Street Hooligans," Not the best representation
","I actually ended up liking this film more than I thought I would. However, it still misses the spot in a few areas, which will be picked up more by British audiences than the US market. Firstly, Charlie Hunnam's London accent is appalling and extremely distracting. Also, some of the references made to football and hooliganism are not accurate. At the West Ham game, the team they are supposedly playing is Birmingham, who Bovver calls 'dirty Northern b*stards'. For the record, Birmingham is not in the North of England. Also, the organisation of the GSE is not realistic. For a start, all the members are very young which simply would not be true of a firm for a club the size of West Ham. Second, hooliganism is much better organised than is depicted here. Everyone would know exactly who, where and what was likely to happen days before a game and would be prepared. A scenario of anybody 'rushing' an opposing pub is very uncommon and almost impossible in the current era of stringent policing. What is actually shown in this film is a group of lads who like a scrap and love football. Real hooligans are not particularly interested in football, simply the buzz of so many people and the thought of taking on rival firms. I would also say that Elijah Wood, although suitably timid and fresh-faced in his role, takes away from the credibility of the film. If a firm were ever to accept an outsider (particularly from the US) into a firm he would have to prove himself by more than simply landing a couple of lucky punches in a brawl. Wood simply does not show enough of the requisite toughness which would grant him respect. On the whole, the film is well-paced and thoughtfully shot. But it doesn't really capture anything real about hooliganism - or anything we didn't know. I would recommend it as an alternative to the lighter-hearted 'Football Factory', but would not endorse its content to the British viewer.",3,4,6,30 May 2006
Alice in Wonderland," Not bad - but is this what Burton intended?
","Tim Burton's Alice In Wonderland is essentially a sequel to the original story, featuring an older Alice revisiting the familiar characters in Wonderland and charged with saving the Mad Hatter et al from the rule of the evil Red Queen.It is probably to be admired that Burton did not try to regurgitate a story that has been told so many times and instead created a new chapter. However, the execution falls somewhat short and whilst the CGI world and its inhabitants are impressive, the film seems to lack solid foundations, meaning the outcome of Alice's adventure is not particularly gripping or suitably interesting.Much had been made of Johnny Depp's performance as the Mad Hatter, but in truth it is a fairly routine performance from a talented actor who spends far too much time in quirky, off-beat roles like this. Some of the voice contributions are enjoyable - Stephen Fry's Cheshire Cat springs to mind - and Mia Wasikowska is not out of place in the lead role. What lets down a lot of the incidental roles is the lack of a sharp script - several of the allocated 'comedy' parts are either underused or simply not funny enough, Paul Whitehouse's March Hare being the most clear example of the former, Barbara Windsor's Dormouse a case of the latter.It must be said though, that the opening three quarters of an hour are pretty enjoyable as we meet the characters and see the outline of the plot unfold. However, somewhere around the hour mark we lose a fair bit of the obscure fun typically associated with Alice in Wonderland, and are drawn into a fairly formulaic post-Lord Of The Rings 'good vs. evil' yarn. It also becomes increasingly obvious that this is a film for children, and that Burton has sacrificed the typically darker hue of his films for this reason, as well as, sadly, much of the substance. Towards the end, the Mad Hatter character performs a CGI-enhanced dance to a cringingly modern dance beat, at which point those who wanted to give Burton the benefit of the doubt will have surrendered.There's nothing particularly wrong with making a new Alice In Wonderland with a recognisable story line for children. But is this really what Tim Burton was trying to achieve? Perhaps - but it seems unlikely that something any experienced Disney film-maker could have produced is what the director was aiming for. There is also the fact that Burton stubbornly continues to use his wife, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Johnny Depp in pretty much all his films, and that - coupled with his perennial dark fantasy motif - is going to get old whichever way you slice it. The task for him now should be to find a new approach and, preferably, some new stars.Alice In Wonderland is great to look at and enjoyable for the most part. But it's not a classic and should indeed mark a crossroads for Burton and Depp, from where they need to decide whether they want a new challenge or not.",5,2,6,7 March 2010
Avatar," Ground-breaking stuff, but not necessarily new
","I'll admit I was slightly hesitant about seeing Avatar, saturated as it was with an enormous build-up and crazed reviews heralding it as the next great step in film-making. However, I think it's important to have one's own opinions of movies like this, as it would be easy to become prejudiced against them owing to the deluge of commercial hype. And I was pleased that I did choose to see it, especially as James Cameron's terrific special effects are surely best viewed on the big screen with the aid of 3D.And surely the special effects are the key feature of the film. The sheer time, skill and - of course - expense that has gone into the creation of the visuals in Avatar must be unprecedented, and the way in which live action and CGI are brought together is completely new. Rightly, these effects are made the focal point of the film and as much time as possible is given over to showcasing the amazing animation. Some of the action scenes are truly awe-inspiring.However, it would be wrong to say that Avatar totally lived up to its hype. In many ways it's a very basic action film and whilst it will undoubtedly be festooned with awards on the technical side, the actors are unlikely to get anything more then reflected praise. In some ways, I think it was a deliberate choice to make the actors almost a secondary part of the movie so as not to take away from the visual experience. Sam Worthington is a reasonable tough-guy leading man, but is pretty much personality-free, while Sigourney Weaver is probably miscast as his experienced scientist mentor. That said, they are not helped by a grimly banal script which falls down in all its attempts at humour or wisecracks. Honourable mentions should go, though, to Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang who are both highly watchable in the two lead bad guy roles.But I think what really stops this film from truly excelling is the plot. Some might argue that the story is not vital in this type of film, but I can't help but feel that a more original and gripping plot could have pushed this film into a higher echelon. Without giving too much away, Avatar has an extremely strong resemblance to Dances With Wolves in many ways, yet in a kind of watered-down and more superficial way. Understandable, I suppose, as the target audience for Avatar is younger. But for an older audience hoping to see a wholly original piece, this may prove a stumbling block.I suppose the final point to make about Avatar, and films like it, is to wonder just how far films really can be improved by CGI and effects in general. In this case, hundreds of CGI technicians and animators have spent an inordinate amount of time creating an amazing visual world with characters to inhabit it and for that they should be applauded. But have they actually created a new film? Something we hadn't seen or considered before? Personally, I don't think so. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it does suggest that there are limits to what great effects can add to a film beyond what human beings and their emotions can.Avatar is a ground-breaking venture in many ways and delivers solidly as a mega-budget, formulaic action adventure with literally stunning special effects. Will it prove as influential as Star Wars? Probably not. Will it change cinema forever? Unlikely. But the hyperbole that surrounded its release shouldn't stop anyone from appreciating what it does have to offer.",7,0,2,30 December 2009
Invictus," A fumble from Eastwood, but this scrapes over the line.
","Before I watched Invictus, I'd never seen a bad Clint Eastwood film. And having seen it, I still haven't. But although Invictus is not actually a bad film, I couldn't help but feel that Eastwood dropped the ball slightly here (if you'll pardon the pun). The temptation to make a film about someone as iconic as Nelson Mandela must have been huge, and to tie it in with a rousing story of sporting courage against the odds was likely to be a successful formula. And for the most part, it is.Morgan Freeman was born to play Nelson Mandela, and he does it here superbly. Freeman has presence of almost mythical stature, like Mandela himself, which is clear on-screen. In fact, you could almost be watching a film about Morgan Freeman – and I mean that in a positive way. Due to the premise of the film, the role of the South African captain, Francois Pienaar, is key and needed to be played by a top actor, which is why Matt Damon was cast. However, Damon's presence inadvertently causes one of the main downsides to the film, which is the actual rugby action. Due to his size, pretty much all the other protagonists are pretty short themselves, making the games look pretty odd. Anyone who has watched international rugby will note that every team has players, barring perhaps two or three, over six feet tall and in a few cases closer to seven feet. This size issue, and the fact that most of the players simply don't look like international sportsmen, takes away from the realism of the rugby scenes.It is pretty clear that Clint Eastwood was not a rugby fan when he began making this film. The climactic scenes of the World Cup final are actually a bit of a mess and could be confusing to someone not familiar with the game. I guess we have to remember that the majority of people watching this film (i.e. largely Americans) will not know a great deal about the game of rugby and will not notice most of the inaccuracies. But for someone who does know the game, the genuine footage shown of Jonah Lomu tearing through the England defence in the semi-final somewhat shows up the choreographed play elsewhere in the film. Oh, and let's not get started on the frankly ridiculous CGI crowd, which looks no more real than it would in a video game.Generally, the film has some really good performances. Damon is solid as Pienaar, even if his physical presence (or lack thereof) is distracting. Freeman is excellent, and some of the incidental characters are good also, even if they are somewhat formulaically scripted. The film hits all the notes you would expect it to, which is pleasing to the viewer, but never really challenges or surprises. Ultimately, this film probably unfolds exactly the way you would expect it to. The country is divided, Mandela steps in, the rugby team are victorious and everyone is united. It's nothing particularly unsatisfactory; it's just not very exciting.In hindsight, I think Freeman may have been better off sticking with his plan for a full Mandela biopic. But either way, we have the performance we hoped for from Freeman in this role, and that's as good a reason as any to give this film a chance. Rugby fans may just have to exercise some suspension of disbelief.",6,1,3,27 July 2010
The Godfather: Part III," SPOILER: A two-part masterpiece sadly tarnished by the third instalment
","It is difficult to know where to start when commenting on this film, owing to its many points for discussion, but I will try to address the points in turn.Firstly, the casting of this film, in contrast with the first two parts, is generally awful. Robert Duvall was sorely missed and Francis Ford Coppola and his cohorts must surely regret not meeting his pay demands. Talia Shire reprises her role, completely pointlessly, and is totally unconvincing as the matriarch of the family. Of the newcomers, George Hamilton appears not to have an actual character beyond reading the lines of Michael Corleone's lawyer, Bridget Fonda is equally meaningless and Andy Garcia is hackneyed, if willing, as Vinnie Mancini. Sofia Coppola is a disgrace. The film stalls every time she is on screen and she is not capable or attractive enough to fulfil her role.Secondly, Al Pacino had changed so much since part II that he almost appears a different person. At times he is so far removed from his persona in the first two films that he seems to be playing another character. And whilst his performance is easily the film's best, his better moments are offset by a couple of cringe-worthy incidents, such as his hammed-up stroke in the kitchen scene.The film itself does entertain at times - but at nowhere near the level of the first two. Much of the story is lifted and turned around from the previous films and consequently is not as interesting. The script, much like some of the cast, simply does not possess the hunger of the originals.But the worst moment of the film is how it chooses to end the trilogy, moving as it does from the awful, to the excellent and plummeting back to the diabolical. Firstly, we are treated to a final turn from Ms. Coppola as she dies unconvincingly on the opera house steps. We then see Pacino's finest moment of the film as he expresses initially silent agony at her side - a truly great few frames. But then, for some unfathomable reason, we are transported forward 20 or 30 years to Sicily, where Pacino is wearing some of the worst make-up in movie history, and he falls out of his chair and dies. To call this final scene rushed, crass, unimaginative, comical, insulting, lazy, pathetic or arrogant would be to understate things greatly. There simply could not have been a worse ending to the trilogy.All this said, the film is watchable if you are able to put all of these points out of your mind and simply let it wash over you. There a lot worse films. But I awarded it five stars owing to the unbelievable mess made by the men that created the two original masterpieces. My advice is to watch this once, but in future only bother with Parts I and II, as they were intended.",5,1,3,31 July 2007
