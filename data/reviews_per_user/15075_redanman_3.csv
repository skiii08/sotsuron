Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disappointing
","I heard so much, expected half of it and got <5%.Sad that this passes for comedy. I was not offended at all, laughed hardest at the two naked gentleman (not to make a spoiler), but the movie overall was a poor rip-off of Dumb and Dumber in several direct and oblique ways.More of a yawn than anything else. I kept waiting, but it never came.The humor has all been done before, making 'Jew Jokes' even by a Jew is old hat.It was not shocking. It was not original. It was not a new method of presentation.",4,4,9,3 December 2006
War of the Worlds," Incredibly, laughably disappointing, stupendously awful -other than that, just OK
","Stephen Spielberg has gone nothing but downhill since Jaws. A.I. had hope until Dr Know showed up, but after 20 minutes of good special effects to start this movie (War of the Worlds) it became so bad I literally laughed out loud - repeatedly.Bad scare tactics, re-hashed monsters, ridiculous characters and product placements (One example - A brand-new $4000 Omega chronograph watch on a ruff-tuff NYC crane operator as he lives in squalor?) The improbable logistics of travel by the characters, the incongruous implausibility of the ending and the complete and utter devastation of the world being ignored because now that mummy and pop and the kiddies are at cleaned and polished granny and grand-dad's who are on a devastated street, but emerge looking as if they've come from an upstairs downstairs episode makeup session? The complete ignorance of the laws of physics and water mechanics? All the cars on the freeways were perfectly out of the way for Ray to zoom through in the only operating vehicle in the tri-state area? When is Hollywood going to create another original script? Awful, awful, awful, awful,awful, awful, awful.Funny, it still seems just as awful as before.",1,12,25,5 July 2005
Casino Royale," Best Bond?
","Played completely straight, pulling even the punning, this Bond is as satisfying as a a meal in your favorite Parisian restaurant, a great steak, the freshest sushi - choose your simile.Daniel Craig kept reminding me of a strange but satisfying combo of Sting and Steve McQueen; that devilish smile in his eyes and that killer ready to go on a moment's notice. Compared to the abysmally horrid Roger Moore tired farces of the 1970's we have another apex to contrast to the abyss. This will go down as either the best or the best of the rest depending on your loyalty to Sir Sean Connery. (I haven't decided yet.) This is a very satisfying escapist movie-making blockbuster. Something Bond fans have waited decades for. Some will not care for it because the genre does not appeal to all types, but few with interest in spectacular and varied settings, action escapism and fantasizing 'the stories behind the news' will have two hours of first-class 'as you ordered'.Isn't that what we go to the movies for anyway?Does it look like I give a damn? I'm going again. Soon.Cheers. I'm a happy mate with this one.",10,3,6,23 November 2006
