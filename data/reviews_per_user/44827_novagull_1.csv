Source Code," Seriously.....
",I can't quite understand why this movie is getting some rave reviews - it is absolutely terrible. Very predictable and an ending that is so ridiculous that my 4 year old daughter could have thought up something more interesting. Very average acting and found myself dozing off to sleep after ten minutes of watching this utter garbage. If only it were true and the source code were to be applied to my own life - then I could go back in time and choose another movie to watch. Worst movie this year by far - and to think that it scores so highly in Rotten Tomatoes!Don't waste your time or money :(,1,42,85,18 April 2011
