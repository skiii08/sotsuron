The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," What a movie
","I have read the book a few times and was a bit disappointed that the first dance at the wedding and other small things did not make it into the movie. BUT like with Eclipse the book is the detail and the movie the highlights. I loved this movie. I never really liked the character of Jacob and in this movie he actually has a purpose and I can stand him a bit more. The scene with the wolf pack talking was amazing.. The honeymoon was a bit short but still beautiful. Bella looked great on her wedding day but I felt she could have look prettier as she is a beautiful girl but then realized that her transformation trough the movie to the point where she becomes a vampire is the point. She is stunning when she becomes a vampire and the way it was done is amazing.. I have never seen anything like it.. Absolutely amazing. The movie felt a bit hurried although it is nearly 2 hours long, I am definitely seeing it again to catch all the detail I missed the first time. I hate the idea of having to wait a whole year before seeing the conclusion.. but other than that it was worth loosing the sleep for a midnight showing.. LOVE IT..",10,21,45,16 November 2011
