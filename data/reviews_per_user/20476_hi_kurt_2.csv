Raiders of the Lost Ark," A cliffhanger classic of cinematic expression

As Good as It Gets," As Great As It Comes
","An ABSOLUTELY wonderful film! The story.. The cast.. The heart of it & how love makes positive changes.. (I could go on & on);
I don't watch many love story type movies (not that I don't like them) yet this one is my favorite & I couldn't tell you how many times I've seen it/maybe 50+
