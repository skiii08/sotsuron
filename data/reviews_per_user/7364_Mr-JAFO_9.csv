E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Part funny, part moving, entirely original.
","I saw this movie on its first release in 1.982 (when I was 6) and a lot of times since then (the last one, last weekend on TV), and my feelings didn't change at all: it's a pleasure for me to watch this movie. It can be childish, as some users may say, but it was essentially made for children (when I first saw it I was a kid), and, like some user said, for good-hearted people (that's a thing that can't grow old).First, I found it funny for some special moments (the first meetings between the alien and all -one by one- of the family members, when ET got drunk and caused an identical effect on Elliot, and the following scene in his classroom -kiss included-) that are simply great. Especially good was the boy who lay down to make Elliot arrive to the girl's lips, and the ride on the streets in the Halloween day, how he confused a fake 'Yoda' with his 'home'.Moving, because of ET's 'humanity' (when he saw Elliot's finger wounded he immediately cured it and he made a sacrifice trying to save Elliot's life), his powers (especially when he made Elliot's bicycle and later all the boys' lift and fly), his feelings (his desperation for finding himself lost in a distant planet and not finding an answer to his calls, that made him sad almost till death), and the final farewell, the final top to the movie.Original, because it shows an alien in a different point of view. Most of the 'aliens' films before (e. g., 'Alien') and even after (e. g. 'Independence Day' and/or 'Mars Attacks') show evil aliens that try to invade the Earth and/or exterminate Manhood. This alien is good, has his feelings, and a great heart inside.Like ET (the character), ET (the movie) has got a great heart. Watch it.",9,2,4,1 March 2004
The Others," Amenábar at his best.
","This is really a great masterpiece where a Spanish director shows there can be quality out of the Dream Factory that Hollywood actually is (I don't only say that because we share nationality). This movie shows how really great movies should be, and it has a hard to confuse classic taste. The way things are treated, the lack of explicits, and especially the lack of blood and/or gore makes this movie become a real classic since the first theatrical release. It's obvious that Mr. Amenábar just drank from the best sources (especially Hitchcock). Since 'Poltergeist' I didn't see less killings in a whole movie, and, however, it's still chilling. Take example of these, you new filmmakers.",9,0,2,18 November 2005
Forrest Gump," Greatly overrated mix-up
","I must confess that the 2 first times I saw this movie (its theatrical release and its 1st television issue), I loved, even adored, this movie. But then, looking back more calmly, I started thinking: what does this movie really have? A mix of historical situations (in chronological order, of course), a lot of songs (especially from the 1960s & 1970s), an incredibly lucky idiot whose strange quote 'life is like a chocolate box' entered cinematic pop culture and, behind it all, an irresponsible depiction of points of view (typicall from the 1990s). This movie was actually the perfect excuse to play a ton of oldies (remixed and remastered to fit the strange 1990s likes), use innovative technology (especially digital) to place this boy everywhere and revisit recent history. (Almost) nothing more, and nothing less.",Null,1,3,22 November 2005
Schindler's List," Good, but extremely overrated.
","I must confess that when I first saw this film in theater, and the followin' few times I saw it on TV, I became a passionate defender of it and so I tried 2 tell everybody who asked me Y I liked it. But, in time, I became disappointed: the film is good, compared with the trash we're accustomed 2 watch these days (& almost all last decade), but it doesn't deserve the consideration of an 'All-Time Classic', because it isn't. It's a subjective story told from a personal & subjective point of view (Steven Spielberg is Jew), & it tries 2 emphasize the violent side of it, but payin' few attention 2 anything else. Some scenes R disconnected from the rest of the plot, it contains nudity & sex scenes that don't fit 2 the tale (sexual relationships among Mr. & Ms. Schindler, between Amon GÃ¶th & her lover) & make the movie become rather vulgar instead of true classic. It's got sometimes the taste of a documentary, but the connection between the general scenes & the fictional (particular) ones is not very well made. The violent scenes (especially shootin') R too explicit (there's no need 2 place a camera & stop it above a dead body bleedin' 4 showin' us the crimes that were committed). The idea of shootin' the film in B&W, I think it's actually because that was very 'in' those years & it only took a good excuse 2 do it. If Spielberg really wanted 2 make a rigor approach 2 the matter the same way it was told by those media, he would have also made the film with analog Mono sound, & with less explicit violence. Definitely, watch it if U want, but don't expect a timeless classic.",4,1,9,20 February 2004
Psycho," Probably, the greatest movie ever because of 2 people especially...
","...and these people are the director (Alfred Hitchcock, whose work is simply matchless-everything can be copied, but the quality-) and, particularly, the leading actor (Anthony Perkins), absolutely insurmountable. It's a real pity (I'd rather say a shame) that he didn't earn either an Oscar nomination, because his work was perfect. That's my point of view: without Mr. Hitchcock, 'Psycho' wouldn't have been the same; but without Tony Perkins, it simply wouldn't have been at all.",10,0,1,18 February 2004
The Sixth Sense," Powerful and unusual thriller with chilling depiction of classic horror.
","This is one of my favorite movies from the 1990s and all times. I had received very good reviews, so I went to watch it by myself (it's not the first time that a below average movie is unfairly overrated, and the opposite thing as well): I was far away from being disappointed. The beginning appears to show just another ordinary story, but that's just one of the cheating things from the movie (another one is the ending, but of course I can't reveal it). It's got all the ingredients for a perfect combination between drama, horror and thriller. I remember the fears of the boy (perfectly performed by Haley Joel Osment, who, by the way, was a few years older than his character Cole as well as the desperation of his mother, who can't understand what's happening to him (even when he tells her what happens), and just can't believe he contacts spirits (she things he's only victim of school abuse). I also remember the restless psychiatrist, trying to help the boy as well as he tries to save his marriage, but it's only at the end when he realizes what ACTUALLY happens. The great interaction between both characters, trying to help each other, is priceless. The dramatic story of Cole's grandma and his contacts with her spirit, which are only believed by his mother at the end, when he reveals a special thing. Well, just watch it.",8,0,0,23 November 2005
Munich," S. Spielberg at his worst.
","I saw this movie about 1 week ago, expecting to find a sort of chant or hymn to human values, an excellent screen development and a story really well told in order to keep audience's attention at every single moment. However I found just the opposite: unconnected and senseless scenes, boring argument and lots of explicit violence that sometimes changed my boredom to a disagreeable taste. I found this movie really chaotic and tasteless. Sometimes it really reminds me 'Schindler's List', with lots of tasteless violent scenes, some scenes of documentary or similar, many stories being told at the same time (I know in real life many things usually happen simultaneously but trying to tell different stories at the same time makes the audiences loose all points and able to follow none of them). Steven Spielberg did lots of better movies and I hope he finds again his way in the future, with a movie that can really capt the attention of the audiences 'from the first 10 minutes', as he said sometimes.",3,0,4,16 February 2006
The Birds," Really disappointing stuff for a really disappointing movie
","I must confess I always wanted to watch this movie because I saw other classics of Sir Alfred Hitchcock, until I actually saw it. Really, the movie shows what a movie shouldn't ever have: extremely poor special effects and VERY sappy dialogs and situations. The plot seems to make ABSOLUTELY no sense at all: no-one knows why birds attack, if they finish attacking somehow (even at least because they're bored and/or tired). They join, they attack and they just go away no-one knowing REALLY why. Some things are good, however: the camera is quite well used in almost all scenes, and the soundtrack is really good sometimes, but both the script and the production have got a lot of flaws and lacks, something that Sir Alfred Hitchcock should not allow.",3,8,16,10 January 2006
From Here to Eternity," Brilliant and powerful.
","I´ve recently seen this movie (once again, I can't remember how many times I saw it) and it feels great every time. There's a detail each time that makes it so good even today. This movie shouldn't only be remembered by the love scene of Lancaster-Kerr on the beach: it has much more attractiveness. The whole cast is very efficient (and especially Clift). The scene where Clift plays 'Silence' after the killing of 'Spaghetti' (greatly performed by Sinatra) with tears in his eyes remains as one of the most powerfull ones in the movie. The love affair is also truly effective and it 'burns' even out of the screen, and the passionate fight performed by M. Clift and E. Borgnine (also very good as the 'bad guy') shines in all its splendor in the screen. That film simply couldn't be better done, even if it was shot in color and a multichannel sound system of the time (4-track Stereo, 70 mm-6 Track, etc.). Brilliant.",Null,1,1,3 August 2004
