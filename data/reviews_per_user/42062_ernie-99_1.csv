The Blair Witch Project," You must see this movie
","This is both the scariest and most inventive film I have ever seen. I was completely blown away. It is also the longest line I have ever seen for a movie. It was longer than the line for Godzilla, Jurassic Park, and any Batman movie I've seen. There had to be at LEAST 500 people in line for it. A group told me that they drove five hours from Mexico to see this movie. I've been hearing a lot of critics saying that twenty-somethings were not going to enjoy it because it didn't have blood and guts or Jennifer Love-Hewitt. Everyone in the theater was probably under 30, and it got huge applause at the end. People were walking out crying. Everyone loved it. Immediately went into my top ten best film",10,1,2,18 July 1999
