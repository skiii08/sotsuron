Angels & Demons," Too Dark!
","While the plot and story were pretty good, I was really disappointed in how dark the movie is. What's up with so many directors lately filming everything in the dark? I'd say at least 60% of this movie was filmed in the dark or at night and in a lot of the scenes it's hard to make out what's going on. The part with the flashlight in the dark hole is just too much. I want to go to a movie to relax and enjoy it and I'm tired of having to work to make out what's going on. It seems that directors have opted for darker shots so they don't have to work as hard on the scene make-up. I for one am tired of it! I was also a little disappointed that this movie didn't have the depth of interest and intrigue as the first one. Instead of dealing with symbols and solving puzzles, this one seemed to be more of a history lesson and didn't seem to be much of a challenge for the main character.",2,2,7,26 May 2009
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Would have been a good movie if it had an ending.
","I really hate watching movies that go along fine and you're enjoying it and then suddenly it just ends. It's like they ran out of money and just decided to call it a day, even though they hadn't gotten to the actual end of the movie! This movie is like that. I enjoyed most of it. It's funny but dark and I enjoyed the acting.... right up to the point where it ended and the credits started rolling. What the heck. No resolution as to if they go through with what they've started, and no resolution as to who the killer is. How do you make a movie about someone being killed and the victim's mother trying to do what she can to get the killer caught and then they never show it. Very disappointed! I feel like I wasted 2 hrs of my time for nothing.",3,4,7,22 January 2018
Pitch Perfect 2," Really, really disappointing.
","I absolutely loved the first movie. It was laugh out loud funny, the music was great, and the story line was good. I was really excited to hear that they were making a sequel and couldn't wait to see it. Oh was I disappointed. I hate to say it, but the music didn't move me (other than the last couple songs), I hated the story, and other than a couple chuckles, I certainly didn't find most of it very funny. The attempts at humor were so bad that I really question if they used the same writers or for budgeting reasons, hired some kids from a high school. Not only were these 'jokes' not funny, but there were many times when I cringed at the dialog and felt sorry for the actors having to deliver the lines... especially for Becca in those awkward scenes with the woman from the German group. That was just stupid.I really wanted to love this movie but ended up just wanting my money back. To me the only redeeming parts of the movie were the final scenes with the 2 rival groups performing. Those were really the only musical numbers that look like someone spent some time on the music and choreography. The rest were just thrown together and certainly nothing special.",5,6,25,24 May 2015
