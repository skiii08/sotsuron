Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Can a movie actually get any COOLER?
","Can a movie actually get any cooler?  Highly Unlikely!Uma Thurman playing a deadly assassin out to restore honor to her lost daughter's name in a QT movie?!  I can't think of anything better!  This film simply reeks of solidity, style, and most of all coolness.  It is OOZING with coolness and badassness!  So many things are explained that once left you hanging in Volume 1.  Black Mamba is fleshed out as one of the greatest cinematic heroines in history, as well as Bill an evil, sadistic villain.  The Showdown between Black Mamba & California Mountain Snake is outlandishly dirty and tough - it's improbable there's a fight scene between two women out there as vicious as this, or as COOL.From the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei, to Budd's disturbing submission techniques, to coming face to face with her daughter, and *gasp* Bill, this movie may very well be my favorite movie of all time.10 / 10",10,0,1,1 July 2004
Alien 3," 'This is a maximum security prison, and you have no weapons of any kind?'
","ALIEN 3 is difficult to explain, but I feel I should put in a good word for it.  Being a highly visual person, I tend to veer towards pretty movies, instead of movies with character depth.  Some might see this as shallow, but it's just the way I am.  Not to say I don't care for Ripley or Newt or Hicks - they are GREAT characters.  I consider ALIENS to be perfectly done (10/10).When I was young, I used to watch this movie all the time, and it was the first of the ALIEN series that I viewed.  Since I've grown to undertand movies on a little bit of a deeper level now, it seems like ALIEN 3 still holds up.  I consider ALIEN 3 to have the COOLEST OPENING CREDITS OF ALL TIME.  So stylistic, so gothic, so sad.  But COOL.  The rest of the movie is pretty intense and will have you seeing orange the entire last half.  I really don't think David Fincher could have done any better with this storyline. ALIEN 3 reminds us that even the greatest triumphs (Newt's rescue and the destruction of the Queen) always turn into the endless sadness that the universe is basically made of.  Plus, it really does bring closure to the story by Ripley making the ultimate sacrifice in order to save thousands.7 / 10 for sure!  A very decent effort.",7,0,2,5 April 2003
Alien: Resurrection," A Shameful Disgrace to a Legendary Saga
","I honestly feel cheated out of a good movie experience by watching Alien 4.  I think this is because the first three films were so tasty and classic that this just could NOT even hold a candle to the others.  Sure, at times this movie is pretty and colorful, and that's why I gave it a 3/10.  But where is the Bad-A Ripley I once knew? She's not herself, and it just doesn't cut it.  Go buy the Alien Legacy on DVD, but give the 4th movie to your poor friend...As far as I'm concerned, Ripley's story ends on Fiorina 161...",3,0,1,1 February 2003
Alien," A Dark, Strange, Fabulous Journey!
","The very beginning of the Alien Saga starts off in 1979 with Ridley Scott's ALIEN.It's really quite doubtful that the moods in this movie, though often imitated, will ever be effectively duplicated.  I think that the actual mystery of seeing this creature for the first time is quite marvelous.
At its core, Alien is technically a horror movie - and, though I'm not a fan of the genre, this movie got to me (I now own all three on DVD).  It's stylistic, dark, and unforgiving.This of course being the first movie in the saga, will be when you're all introduced to the most bad-assed sci-fi heroine of all time.  Lt. Ellen Ripley, though not a soldier or warrior, is more assertive and tough than you might think that average warrant officer might be... and you will see her endless battle throughout Alien, Aliens(1986), and Alien 3(1992) - I don't care what they tell you - they did NOT make a 4th one.  Well it just does not exist... IMO.Although the sequel, James Cameron's ALIENS, is much better, this movie is where it all started, it is REALLY GOOD and... oh hell just go see it already!",9,0,1,5 February 2003
Aliens," 'I knew you'd come...'
","ALIENS really does have it all.  Perfect direction.  Beautiful cinematography.  Intense characters.  Big guns.  Action.  Heroism. Courage.  Battles.  Friendship.  Bravery.  It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history, and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by the badass Sigourney Weaver), a warrant officer, and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.  No one else could have done it like her.  Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature - set to a pulsing military score (James Horner delivers in a big way!).  Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.There's not really much else to say - just go watch the movie on DVD, and you will not be let down.  You're in for a wild ride!!!ALIENS:  THIS TIME, IT'S WAR",10,243,324,6 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," The Greatest Film of All Time
","From the picture perfect opening shot to the tragically poeticending, Crouching Tiger reeks of style.  It oozes style.  Each frameis just like the pictures of a storybook.  The first time I actually sawthis film in theatres, I thought it was a decent film.  The secondtime, it made my top ten, and from there on out, I've grown to placeCrouching Tiger in my #1 slot!  I think many might automatically discount CTHD because it is aforeign film, has subtitles, and people fly.  First of all, your mothershould have taught you how to read quickly and efficiently! Broaden your horizons!  This is a martial arts fantasy film.  Theflying is parallel to the inner strength of the characters.  Reallyamazing when you start to wonder....The fight scenes in this movie may never be matched!!!  The finalconfrontation between Shu Lien and Jen Yu in the dojo issomething that I'll never forget.  The only fight scenes that comeclose are the fight scene in the courtyard (Also CTHD) and Ripley'spowerloader fight against the Queen Alien (Aliens, 1986).Acting, Cinematography, Fight Scenes, Story, Everything,PERFECT.There's really nothing else to say about such an amazing film.Run to your local DVD retailer and buy!!",10,1,2,16 February 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Yellow-haired warrior, avenge thyself!
","From the desperate, cold inhumanity of a Bride awakening to find she has been shot in the head and lost her baby, to the bloody carnage that ensues, KILL BILL vol. 1 reeks of style, tribute, and intrigue.  Our heroine, Black Mamba, slices her way through the first half of her 'Death List Five', restoring honor to her lost daughter's name, in true Samurai old-school fashion.  The mere outline of all principle characters in this truly dark tale is %100 pathetic - these ruthless people, these scum-of-the-earth assasins, some even sadistic, deserve to be hacked apart for what they have done with their lives. The sheer brutality and satisfaction which arises from each gruesome battle will actually creep you out.  Thurman fleshes out the Bride as a lethal, hardass, yet vulnerable international hitwoman. A cult classic the day it was first shown in theatres.KILL BILL VOL. 1 WILL TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY!",10,0,2,11 June 2004
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," JUST PLAIN EXCELLENT
","From the disturbing opening scene and ballad intro to this gory martial arts tribute, to the Showdown at the House of Blue Leaves, Kill Bill Vol. 1 shines as a bright star of cinematic glory!Uma Thurman dazzles as The Bride, a woman shot down by her former boss, Bill, on her wedding day.  Waking up four years later from a coma, she realizes everyone at her wedding was killed, including her fiance, as well as her unborn child! From there on out, you know it's time for REVENGE, samurai style BABY!Great little cliffhanger at the end leaving you craving Volume 2!!!Kudos to Uma and the other fighters for their relentless diligence in their martial arts training - I kind of know how you feel guys!  They are all great fighters, at least on screen!Run to see this movie while it is still in theatres, and when it hits DVD, run to the store to buy it!9 / 10",10,0,1,13 November 2003
Grindhouse," You haven't experienced anything like it.
","Ah, Grindhouse. No words to quite describe it. For me, there is nothing more valuable or intriguing than trash AS high art. This movie is just that...in SPADES. Want to escape your life for 3 hours? Do it. But be sure not to go to the bathroom or even miss one second of this ultra violent, exploitative tour de force. Remember the 'NOW OUR FEATURE PRESENTATION' title card from Kill Bill Vol. 1? Grindhouse basically feels like that all the way through. I can honestly say that, after viewing this masterpiece, I walked out of the theater shaking and smiling - a REAL smile. They say movies produce drugs in the brain, and after seeing Grindhouse, I have no doubt my dopamine levels were severely upped. Planet Terror, the first in the double feature, is just plain fun all the way through. That's really all I can say. The ending TRULY feels like a B movie. The fake trailers are fun too, but the real star of this entire effort is by far DEATH PROOF.. Pure Tarantino from beginning to end, the only complaint I have is a little bit of excessive dialog (reminiscent of the Superman speech from Kill Bill Vol 2) - but it's not as bad as people try to convey. Wait it out folks...wait out all 3 hours and 11 minutes of this feature and I promise it will be worth it. After it was over, people were actually cheering and clapping, something I haven't experienced in years...maybe ever. Rodriguez and Tarantino's egos DO show through the film, but who cares? These guys are so talented and passionate, they couldn't make a real B movie if they tried. At least they've contributed SOMETHING to the world. GRINDHOUSE. Don't walk to the theater to see this...RUN!",10,2,7,8 April 2007
