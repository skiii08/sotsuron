Casablanca," As Time Goes By...
","What else can I say about 'Casablanca' that hasn't already been said? Truth is, there isn't much; but there is a lot to be said about this movie, so I'm gonna give you my opinion on this legend of a film.'Rick's Cafe Americain', 1941: War erupts throughout Europe and the US. Cynical bar owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) will not help anyone in need of assistance: He 'sticks his neck out for nobody.' He is visited in his Cafe by a German trouble-causer by the name of Ugarte (Peter Lorre) who is on the run. Ugarte asks Rick to safeguard two letters of transit (or VISA's) to leave Morocco which have been reported as stolen. Rick holds these in the piano of his entertainer and good friend, Sam (Dooley Wilson).Ugarte is tracked down and immediately killed by the authorities. Meanwhile, French resistance leader Victor Laszlo enters the bar with his lady, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), Sam panics and hopes that Rick stays out of the way - knowing that it will only cause a fuss - Ilsa also knows this, but she desperately wants to see Rick, so she asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By' (a song that Rick banned soon after his and Ilsa's break-up). Rick storms out of the back, he goes berserk; only to look up at Ilsa. He gives a shy smirk, and in that 5-10 second freeze the audience feels their pre-existing passion and love for each other as the camera switches from face to face.Ultimately, the decision lies with Rick as to whether he takes the two VISA's for himself and Ilsa, or for Ilsa and Victor. His subsequent decision to leave himself in Morocco is a heartbreaking, but nevertheless honourable, one.Everyone and their cat should know that 'Casablanca' is one of the most often spoofed/quoted movies in film history. Here are a few of them:'Play it, Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'. You played it for her, now play it for me!''Round up the usual suspects.''Here's lookin' at you, kid.''We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we got it back last night.''Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.'(Rick) 'This gun is aimed directly at your heart.' (Captain Renault) 'Lucky for me, that is my least vulnerable spot.'(Rick) 'I came to Casablanca for the waters.' (Captain Renault) 'The Waters? You're in the middle of a desert.' (Rick) 'I was misinformed.''I stick my neck out for nobody.''I'm the only cause I'm interested in.'(Guest) 'What nationality are you, Rick?' (Rick) ' ...I'm a drunkard.' (Captain Renault) 'That makes Rick a citizen of the world.'...So now you see why this movie is a major motion picture classic? It sure does speak for itself. the 60-some years since it's release has brought some of the greatest cinematic minds lots of inspiration; and for this, we thank the makers of this wonderful film.Excellent Film - *****",10,0,2,16 July 2008
The Breakfast Club," A Summary Of Every By-gone Era
","While 'The Breakfast Club' appears on the outside to be a one-dimensional high school comedy about five misfits who are each spectacularly different, the truth is actually far deeper and much more intriguing...Each person in 'The Club' represents each group in schools across the board. We have 'The Athlete', 'The Basket-Case', 'The Princess', 'The Brain' and not forgetting 'The Criminal'. Each of these students believe that they are simply there to be disciplined, but the truth is an eye-opener seeing as detention is possibly the best thing to happen to them in their educational lives. It helps them garner an understanding of each individual and, while some of them don't exactly see eye-to-eye on their first meeting, they grow and crawl out of their typecast shells and see the characters for what they really are: Individual.This may be an obvious insight, but rarely have we witnessed a movie so spectacularly spellbinding and riveting as this one. Another point of note is that the viewers and the characters and confined to merely a few rooms in this, at times, claustrophobic school which is characterised as some sort of prison for these no-hopers. Thus leaving the movie hinging on it's dialogue and acting (a la '12 Angry Men', 'Dial M For Murder', 'Rope', etc.), which, for a group of young thespians is spectacular... One to be seen to be believed. Thoroughly recommended. Two thumbs up.",9,0,0,9 June 2008
