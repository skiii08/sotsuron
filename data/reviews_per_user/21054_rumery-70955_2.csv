Ford v Ferrari," Thrilling action and high drama
","This is the most entertaining and one of the most satisfying films I've seen in years. Don't let viewer reviews by racing snobs deter you from seeing it. Two and a half hours flew by. The script is tight and efficient with great pacing and just the right amount of drama, the racing scenes are thrilling and all the performances are excellent, with Christian Bale the standout. My husband and I have very different tastes in movies and this is one of the few that had enough action for him along with a captivating story for me; we were both riveted throughout. The whole film is as exciting and fun as the previews conveyed, which is rare in my experience.",9,4,8,22 November 2019
Spotlight," 5 Years Later Spotlight is Still Great and Relevant
","I just watched the movie again, in 2020. The message is perhaps more relevant now: the need for searching, patient, in depth journalistic research and stories, especially when challenging authority, powerful institutions and ingrained assumptions. The film is fascinating, low key but suspenseful even though you know the story...and the fact that, almost two decades after the Boston Globe published its series on the cover-up by the highest levels of the Boston Catholic diocese of decades of sexual abuse of children by nearly 100 priests, it is still reverberating worldwide today. The script, direction and acting are excellent. Can't wait to see a film soon about how dogged, moral, heroic journalists bring down the current corrupt presiden and his enablers.",10,1,2,15 February 2020
