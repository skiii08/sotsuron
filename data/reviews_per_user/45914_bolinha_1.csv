Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hype Victim
","Only a few days ago i saw this movie, since here in Portugal it arrived a little late. But the feeling i had after i left the cinema was that Episode 1 could have been really an excellent movie with an immersive atmosphere, but... Jar Jar was there. Yes it may be a common place to say this but that character is so childish it ruined the whole script. As an Star Wars fan i felt disappointed because to me clearly George Lucas has 'Merchandising' on his mind and as consequence all those stupid (and rip off from old movies)sequences had an target: Children. Since i´m not a child Episode 1 doesn´t cut it for me anymore.",Null,0,1,2 November 1999
