Skyfall," One of the best Bonds ever
","Sensational addition to the Bond series. Again, we see Daniel Craig as a raw and gritty 007 whose relationship with M takes several interesting turns. Personally my favourite Daniel Craig Bond. Sure, the girls and corny gags have dried up a little, but the storyline, coupled with a brilliant villain in Bardem make this a Bond classic. The addition of a new Q and the work of Ralph Finnes really add a special something to this. Finnes shows a lack of respect for M's judgement and is of the belief her opinion is compromised when she sends Bond back in the field. As they have been with all Daniel Craig Bond's, the opener is brilliant! 10/10 - maybe the franchise's all time best!",10,1,6,24 December 2013
