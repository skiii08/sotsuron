Black Swan," 'Perfect'
","I had the opportunity to see Black Swan in one of the 18 theaters that it opened up on this weekend, although I generally do not do so, I was compelled to write a review of the film.From top to bottom, this film is at the height of what it means to be true art in cinema. The various elements of the film, the mise-en-scene, was so incredibly structured by filmmaker Darren Aronofsky that one need only sit back and admire at the fluidity of his camera movement, or the marvelous hue of colors amidst a film which has it's color scheme largely dedicated to the symbolism of black and white.The performances where spot on, Vincent Cassel was terrific as the suspicious teacher, whose brilliance and lust for the dancers in his show are both quite reputable, one often beating out the other. And Mila Kunis truly shines in this one, bringing out a side of her many probably didn't know was possible. She is absolutely beautiful and aptly portrays the black contradiction to Natalie Portmans white, a terrific contrast of good and evil. Kunis, however, as many may assume, is not meant to be there to spark a general conflict of good vs evil, but to emphasize the side of Portman that we have not yet seen. A side that will drive her to the brink of insanity to obtain.And therein lies the true theme of the film, obsession and physical strain over all else. Much like 'The Wrestler' we have the main character dedicated to an unappreciated form of physical art. Here, it is Portman's obsession with becoming the lead of the ballet Swan Lake which drives her into madness. You enter her mind as her teacher pushes her to become perfect, pushing her to let go of her fragile White Swan and become the loose and destructive Black Swan. As you follow her through the stages of her audition leading towards a booming finale she becomes less and less aware of what around her is distortion and what is reality. As she loses grip, Aronofsky's ability to depict psychological deterioration shines through.And make no mistake, this film belongs to Aronofsky and Portman. As stated, Aronofsky captures everything beautifully in frame, his movement of the camera is almost as fluent and beautiful as the very dancers on the screen. His use of behind the head vantage shots has been a bit of a trademark of his, allowing as to see what the character is. And his use of lighting is nothing short of extraordinary. But now comes the true star: Natalie Portman. She blew me away, from start to finish, she displayed her transformation for the sweet girl to the physically and psychologically obsessed, all the way through attempting to embody the white and black swan when necessary, literally trying to become them in her mind, driving her towards insanity in the pursuit of perfection. Words cannot describe Portman's performance here, to say it is Oscar worthy would be a vast understatement, as the depth of her character goes so deep it would nearly be worthy of playing two separate roles. So fragile at time that you fear for her life, and so corrupted at others that you hate her. Acting at it's finest, Portman deserves an Oscar.All things considered the film is nearly perfect, one of the best dramas I've ever seen, and one that is as iconic and intense as it is horrifying at times. Just to mention a few other things, Winona Ryder, in the small amount of screen time she had, was spectacular, and truly terrifying during particular scenes. And as always, when Aronofsky and Clint Mansell team up, the score is both epic and eerie, somehow simultaneously. The overcasting score of a distorted and intense version of Swan Lake itself brilliantly compliments the atmosphere throughout the film as these two artist have done before. It could nearly work as a silent film, that's how brilliant it is. If you get the opportunity once this film undoubtedly expands to other theaters see it, it's harrowing and at times difficult to watch, but that combination of beauty and horror makes it impossible to turn away.",10,644,943,5 December 2010
Miracle," An inspiring, amazing, and dramatic portrayal of American Pride
","***THIS CONTENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** This is most definitely a movie that will make my top ten list. It is such an incredible movie that came a great time. Much like the actual event this movie came out during a time when Americans needed pride the most. The movie tells of the historical event of when the 1980 US Olympic Hockey Team comprised of a bunch of kids from rivaling College Hockey teams beat the seemingly unbeatable Soviet Union Olympic Hockey Team that had all been together for over 15 years. Gold Medalists in 1960, 1968, 1972, and 1976. This team of misfits because a conditioned and disciplined team through the help of their tough couch, Herb Brooks. Together, they defeat the Soviets and win the Gold Medal.I am a huge hockey fan, I've been playing since i was 4, and i was very pleased, finally to see a hockey movie made where the goaltender has a very important role to play. Jim Craig, if anyone has seen the actual game, truly played phenomenal, there was absolutely no exaggeration in the movie as to how good Jim Craig played. To me as a hockey fan, this movie is absolutely magnificent and inspiring.The performances throw off the movie a little bit, but for pretty much all of the players in that movie, it was their first time ever actually acting in a major motion picture film. Taking that into consideration the performances were rather well. Kurt Russel who plays Herb Brooks drives this film with his stellar performance as a man who wants to take what he lost 20 years ago.The sports action in this movie is more realistic, more intense, and just flat out better than any other sport film. For those of you who don't like hockey, you've been missing out for some time now.This movie really is just amazing, inspiring, and it really give you the sense of American pride. To Walt Disney pictures, i solute you for making one of your best movies ever.FINAL ANALYSIS: 10.10 ...amazing",9,0,0,5 April 2005
The Ring," A terrific and intriguing white-knuckler that will keep you thinking...
","Horror movies in this century are staying at the PG-13 level, I've expressed this before but this one is terrifying. The images in this movie are gruesome and haunting, they will stay in your head for a while. The little girl Sumara, oh my God she's creepy looking. She glitches every once in a while and that scared me. The acting is good, Hayden, the little boy, I did not like him, but this movie is compared so much to the sixth sense, and he doesn't quite match Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense, but that's because Osment's role in the Sixth Sense had a greater depth. But still Hayden's part is played quite well. Naomi Watts has always been a good actress and she was a good choice for the part. All in all, a good scary movie. 8/10",7,0,1,29 August 2005
Inglourious Basterds," Fantastic, by far the best movie of the year so far
","Inglorious Basterds was hyped as a wild ride gorefest by the legendary Tarentino. QT slipped up a bit with his last few films, but he has created what I believe is his best film since Pulp Fiction. The dialogue is not nearly as cartoon-like as Kill Bill's, it just felt uch more real, but it had that same elegance that all Tarentino films are suppose to have. And that is what makes this film, it is as elegant as it is brutal.The opening scene was one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched in theaters, it was extremely tense, not so riddled with jokes. The performances were all fantastic, down to the smallest characters. Of course the big name here is Brad Pitt, and he truly delivers a great performance, funny, and exciting. Eli Roth surprised me in this one, giving a good performance as the Boston native known as the Bear Jew. Even the smaller roles, Mike Myers and BJ Novak delivered in what manner they needed to as well.The highlight is the dialogue, Tarentino truly delivered what I consider to be his most exciting and real dialogue ever. The music was fantastic also, perfect placement, from the very beginning to the end you don't even realize how long you have been in the theater due to the fact that the movie grips you so much.All and all, what a fantastic movie from QT, he is back and I can't wait for his next on already.",9,4,12,25 August 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Terrific sequel
","In my eyes the third best Disney movie ever created only to Miracle and its predecessor The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's hard to make a sequel worthy of such an extraordinary work of art as the original 'Pirates' was. However this movie more than does it. Everything about this movie is incredibly done. And I believe that if it were not in fact, a sequel, it would be considered even better. But don't look at this movie as a sequel, it's not really much of a follow up on the first movie except for some famous lines taken from it and a couple of cameos and familiar names that show up but I won't ruin any of the surprises. As always in this movie you never know where allegiance lies, that is why both movie will be a success.If there were any mistakes in this movie it was trying to make Orlando Bloom funny. It's not the writers' fault, he's just not funny. He does a good acting job other than that, he becomes a bit more like a pirate as well which is good to see. Kiera Knightly is stunning and delivers the goods as usual. Her character develops more into someone who takes charge as you will see in this movie if you haven't already seen it. You'll be surprised at the incredible effect she has on this movie. And as always Mr. Depp delivers and this time he delivers coming back as the witty, drunken, ladies man, pirate, yet courageous good man Jack Sparrow. The character is a gem of a character that has never been matched before in any other movie ever created. The other thing about this movie that may anger some is you'll wish there was more of a resolved plot, it's a bit sketchy but pay attention, and it'll all make sense. The reason the plot is unresolved is because the movie is a complete set-up for the third movie.All in all, this movie is terrific, go see it. 9/10",7,0,1,9 July 2006
Constantine," Very interesting idea that could have used development - A good comic book adaption.
","This movie was very interesting I thought. The plot is very confusing but if you pay very close attention then you can understand it. Basically what this movie is about is Heaven and Hell. John Constantine had visions of demons as a child and soon tried to commit suicide, which is considered a mortal sin. However after the attempt doctors revived him. He was dead for 2 minutes and he spent those two minutes in Hell, and basically after seeing how horrible Hell was he never wanted to go back. So in a desperate attempt to buy his way into Heaven, he fights off the demons that are trying to cross over into the real world. The story tells us that there is a demon in every bad man and an angel in every good one. So when the demons attempt to come through, Constantine kills them off. But this still isn't good enough to get into Heaven. In the beginning an angel named Gabriel tells John that he can't buy his way into Heaven. John asks what he can do and Gabriel said self sacrifice. And then she tells him he's f***** which I found funny because she's an angel. But anyway...In the end just before the spawn of Satan is release, Constantine meets the devil. (Quick reminder that Hell wants him) The girl he's been with, Angela, has a sister who did the same thing that John did, committed suicide because of the visions she had. Constantine said that as long as she can go to Heaven instead of Hell, he'll go to Hell with him. However that is considered a self sacrifice and before the Devil can take him, He dies and goes to Heaven...briefly. Satan revives him, say that he's going to keep Constantine on the earth until he shows that he belongs in Hell. Cliffhanger, No? OK well I enjoyed this movie. There could have been more action but it actually was much more a suspenseful movie than it was action or horror. However if that is what Hell is really like I'm afraid to go there too. No folks this is no 'Little Nicky' Hell. This is a terrifying portrait of Hell. It creeped me out at least.CAST CONSTANTINE: The acting is okay. Keanu Reeves, although I honestly think he could use some acting lessons, is the perfect person to play the part of Constantine. He's not tormented by the things he sees, he almost sees them as playmates. Just more fun. And he does portray that well. 8/10 ANGELA: Rachel Weisz does an okay job in this movie. To be honest I appreciated her role in the mummy more than in Constantine. In the end she just had no effect on me. I wouldn't have care if she died. But she did an okay job in showing how much she cared for her sister, and how much she really wished she could have helped her. 5/10 CHAS: Shia LaBeouf is going to be a big star when he gets older. He becomes a bigger part of this movie towards the end and he didn't really have much to portray, but he plays his part perfectly. An eager kid wanting to be like John Constantine. 'If you're sitting on the bench you gotta be ready to play, right?' -Best quote in the movie. I was like 'YES! Shia's gonna play a bigger part.' 9/10 So all in all, good movie that could have used development around the plot points. 7.5/10",7,0,4,23 July 2005
The Bourne Ultimatum," Bourne to be Bourne
","After the release of The Bourne Idenity people started referring to the movie as the better Bond, the psychological Die Hard. When the second movie was released Bourne became an international superstar of an action hero who's name is not unknown by many. And now, with the release of the Bourne Ultimatum, it has been confirmed that Matt Damon has taken a name and turned it into an unforgettable phenomenon. The Bourne Ultimatum not only exceeds its predecessors, but it also makes an attempt to be considered the best action movie ever made. Well done on this third time around, they just keep getting better, I hope they continue up with the Bourne Legacy.",9,1,2,10 August 2007
The Matrix Revolutions," Part 3...Good finish
","Okay, I can see why people would dislike this movie. Because I agree, it doesn't live up to the first or second. However my style of approach on movie is to watch a movie for the movie you're watch, not for others. For example, Ocean's Eleven, the remake. I personally didn't think it lived up to the old one, but I based my vote on the movie. If you take this movie and watch it as if its the first of the series, like there was no other Matrix movie, you would probably like it. It is a bit slow at times, and the acting is just OKAY. But all in all a good, dramatic, and conclusive ending to the Matrix Trilogy. It's almost sad. I fitting end to what will be a legendary Sci-fi trilogy. We'll certainly miss the Matrix. Congratulations to the Wachowski brothers for creating a legacy.",6,0,0,24 July 2005
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A new version of American Pie with the age twist, making it funnier.
","I'm probably not smart in comparing this to American Pie because really they are two different types of movies, American Pie is about teens trying to lose their virginity before high school ends. The 40 Year Old Virgin is about a man (Steve Carrel) who has long past graduated from high school, and college. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that he's a 40 year old virgin. Is the movie funny? Absolutely. Have I seen funnier? Yes.The performances in this movie are what really kept it going. Steve Carrel is I think, one of the funniest men in the business as of now. He was good in Bruce Almighty, and probably to most a favorite character in Anchorman, and now his biggest role, in the 40 Year Old Virgin will be talked about as a symbol of his comedic genius. Really just a funny funny movie with a great all around vibe.P.S. This movie has to make EVERYONE feel foolish, either that or you have a really big head to carry on your shoulders. You gotta laugh at it and yourself.8.5/10",8,1,3,30 August 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," This movie had such an opportunity...
","This movie had a great opportunity to be a dark, sorrowful movie that would have left fans and audiences stunned. But no, because Singer left and Ratner took over, you can just tell the difference in directing styles. Plus the screenplay was terrible. David Hayter should have never left as screenwriter, that also did a number on the film. This movie has a lot of death in it. And for a movie with so much death, there were just too many 'trying-to-be-funny' moments. Maybe trying to lighten the mood and make the mood not too serious or something. But who knows what Ratner was thinking. The movies previous to this were incredible and really had a serious, personal turmoil edge to it. This film focused on the turmoil of all mutants, and honestly, there are far to many of them to think about to feel bad for any of the ones that died. Even the important ones. I tried to feel bad. I wanted to feel bad. But I couldn't feel bad because of the terrible surroundings of the movie. Had all this death occurred in one or two, forget it, everyone would be stunned. Not here. Also the movie was all packed into a short 1 hr. 40 mins. If it'd been longer, maybe it would have been better.The positives are that the action sequences really are very cool. The final fight was great and one of the best scenes in any of the three movies. Storm has a more prominent role in this one. And again the main focus is on Wolverine.I think (POSSIBLE SPOILER) that many of the characters were not fittingly thrown out of this movie (ie Cyclops Xavior Mystique especially...) but you'll see what happens and get to decide for yourself. You didn't get into the characters as much as you did the first two installments, this film had the opportunity to be a dark, gloomy, action thriller that left audiences stunned, but wound up an unsatisfying, unfinished, and ultimately a disappointing wannabe film.4.5/10",5,2,4,27 May 2006
The Dark Knight," Whalah! Magic...
","The perfect film has finally been made. I can not express how much this film has surpassed my most dire expectations.First off, Christopher Nolan has made four big movies, and three of those four are in the top 250 for a damn good reason. Nolan has somehow managed to create films with the intensity that one wishes to experience in any film labeled as Dark. And The Dark Knight lives up to its themed title and furthermore surpasses it due to the marvelous acting throughout the entire film.Of course I am going to speak of Heath Ledger but let me hold off and say that every single person played their character to perfection. Gary Oldman is once again the all intensive good guy who you feel for, relate to, empathize with, and he earns the audiences support with another stunningly spectacular performance as Gordon. Replacement Maggie Gyllenhaal enhances the role of Rachel Dawes and takes it to a level that Katie Holmes did not have the capacity to reach. Aaron Eckhart steps in as the biggest surprise of this film and delivers the goods as the guest good guy gone bad as Harvey 'Two Faced' Dent. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, what can I say they constantly deliver the goods.On to the two main men, the men of the hour. Christian Bale returns as Batman, and gives a performance that should not be overshadowed by the truly Oscar Worthy performance of Heath Ledger. Bale's loose cannon stature as Wayne is perfectly contrasted by the hard nosed do good nature of his Dark Knight.Now to the Oscar contender. And I say this, not because of the buzz, but because I saw the film, I am not one to be biased based on sympathy for the man, but I have never been more wrapped up in a character as I was with Heath Ledger's portrayal of the comically insane Joker. His opening scene with the mafia shows it all, you see his talent through the pencil trick, you see his humor and wit through his eerie speech, and you see his insanity. At the same time, you feel sorry for the Joker, who repeatedly, and sternly denies that he is insane. When he is called a freak, a loon, his seriousness in saying 'No...I'm...not...I am not.' Is frighteningly discomforting. Such terminology can describe Ledger's stellar final performance, completely and utterly... frighteningly discomforting, and darkly humorous.From the pencil to the end, the Joker, along with all of these characters, will keep you wanting more. I can honestly say I did not want it to end, this is literally the best movie I have ever seen, there is no doubt in my mind, and it deserves its high spot in the top 250.By the way, if you have not yet seen the movie, it should be up for more than one Oscar, easily could be a Best Picture contender in my mind, Best editing, Score, Sound, Effects, Director, Screenplay, Makeup... of course Ledger will probably be up for Best Supporting Actor, but this film should receive its high recognition for what it truly is. For it is not only Heat Ledger's final and finest performance, but the entirety of the film makes it one of the greatest cinematic achievements in history. Truly...Magic.",10,1,4,18 July 2008
Avatar," Mind blowing experience at the movies
","Avatar grew in my expectations as its release date got closer and closer. Seeing the trailer at first I thought it would be a cool looking movie but nothing I would see. Then I found out James Cameron directed it and everything in my head changed. Suddenly all of the fantastic reviews came out and come the time I went and saw it my expectations had soared for this film. I am glad to say, I was not let down.The story is a bit generic and the script is filled with some of Cameron's trademark corny-ness, but that doesn't take away from anything. Though the plot is generic it is still intriguing, and original in its own very special way. The acting was spectacular throughout as well.As everyone knows however, the main reason for this movie was to push the limit on the world of special effects in Hollywood. Needless to say, Cameron got it done, this film will revolutionize film-making from this stage forth. The effects were stunning, quite simply, unlike anything I had ever seen before. And in 3D it was an even more unique and beautiful experience. Cameron has always been and remains so particular about what goes into his shot, and therefore every shot of every scene is just fantastically visually crafted to make this made up world seem real. It was shocking to see how expansive and how gracefully Cameron's world interacted with the various character's in the story, and it made for a truly one of a kind experience.This film will mark a turning point in the genre, as most all of Cameron's movies do. I would be stunned if Cameron didn't nab another best director Oscar for this one. See it, it is an experience more than a film, you won't regret it. 9/10.",8,2,6,20 December 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," More action...Less story...And that's just fine
","Basically this movie has so much action it's incredible. The FX are even better in this sequel and so is the action. The story isn't as good as the first but I think the reason for that is that the first one sets the stage so well that all this movie has to contribute to the story is a little bit of development. This movie does a good job, it's unlike the original but I believe it does justice to it. The acting again is pretty good, but Keanu Reeves doesn't do as well as he did in the first one, which I think was his best movie. He looses some steam in this one but other performances do as well, so it doesn't really show. Another good Matrix movie. 9/10",7,0,1,24 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," How funny can a movie get?
","This is my new favorite comedy, it used to be There's Something About Mary. this movie kills that movie. Wedding Crashers just has it all. Its very raunchy at times but there's a lot of situational comedy where you're like 'oh my God, that's so funny, I could never have thought of that' Some very good twist took place. Don't go based on the previews, Vince's girl is no virgin, I was shocked, she's actually a sex hound and a half. I could not stop laughing at this movie. And hey for all you ladies out there, there's a good love story to it. And I'm currently single ;) Owen and Vince's chemistry is incredible, perfect, they were great together, definitely the best comedic couple in movies in a while. AND I'm SO GLAD that they did not pick some hot-shot big and famous actress to play the part of Claire, who is Wilson's 'lover'. For once there's no Kirsten Dunst, Cameron Diaz, Jen Aniston, whoever else is big as far as real hot/famous actresses go. Job well done to the casting crew, I think in this case they were the most important factor in the making of this movie.Overall...Absolutely Hysterical...10/10",9,1,6,19 July 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars Is Back To The Way It Used To Be!
","***may contain spoilers*** The New Star Wars Movie is a mirror image of the way the Old Star Wars used to be. This movie is very well paced. There are great action scenes, with the space fights, and the light sabers, they were all done astoundingly well. The movie has a great balance of action, romance, sorrow, everything the old star wars movies pack in so well.George Lucas...to you I must say, well done. Finally, you have redeemed yourself. Episode I: I must say one of the most anticipated movies of 1999. This movie could not even come close to comparing with the original trilogy. Episode II: Though I found Episode II to be much better than the disastrous Episode I, it still could not match up to the original trilogy. When I was going into Episode III, despite the great reviews I had heard, I was expecting an upset yet again. Might I say, I was pleasantly surprised.This movie started off well, with an intriguing space battle, leading into the ship full of droids that the Jedi would have to destroy in order to capture the droid leader and regain the hostage. To top off the great battles, Anakin and Count Dooku duked it out in a classic saber fight. Thats when I realised this movie might be worth paying attention to. Anakin's crossing to the dark side was done amazingly well. What Lucas does is make you believe that he is doing the right thing in trying to obtain the power of the dark side to be able to save his wife Padme, but it turns out that because he crossed, she lost all will to live and died in child birth. Thankyou for the irony Mr. Lucas.Which leads me to my next point. Natalie Portman. She did such a great acting job in this final movie. Her last scene with Anakin is tragic to say the least and also in that scene I give props to Hayden for being such a good insane person. Ewan McGregor FINALLY does what I knew he was capable of doing in this film. He at last depicts Obi Wan Kenobi as Lucas did in the originals. Samuel L. Jackson does the same old good that he did in Episode II, his final scene had me on the edge of my seat. Overall good acting was put into this movie, despite a cheesy script.Finally the connection this movie makes to the originals. This movie gives you the reason for the separation of Luke and Lea, the reason for the lack of Jedi, the beginning of the Empire, and it was just exciting to see each connection.If you don't like the final battle scenes of this movie you are just not normal. The last saber fight between Anakin and Obi Wan, Darth Sidious, the Clones and other Jedi, the Wookies, they were all just amazing, especial the Obi Wan/Anakin fight. Long lasting and fun.Conclusion, this movie has great story, great acting, great special effects, great soundtrack (as always), great action, great transition, great great great great great everything. Star Wars goes out with a bang...Thankyou, Mr. Lucas, for 25 years of stellar entertainment...10/10",8,1,4,22 May 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Excellent Work of Art
","This movie is simply one of the best. Winner of 11 Academy Awards and well deserving. This epic conclusion to the story should just make everyone happy that Peter Jackson and Company even decided to make this trilogy.Story: 10 Graphics: 10 Action: 10 Acting: 10The only thing about this movie is that the ending is too drawn out. When you think the movies over there's still about a half hour left. But that doesn't really contribute to you not liking the movie. The ending, though it is drawn out, is happy. After three movies you are glad to see that everything turns out for the better in Middle Earth. An amazing display of film making.Amazing, 10/10",9,1,2,12 March 2005
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The best horror movie of a decade famous for bloody, gory, and terrifying horror movies.
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was all by myself one night and it came on an HBO channel. I remembered hearing it was a good scary movie. Holy ****! Okay, if anyone has not seen this movie, try doing what I did. I was probably 13 when this happened. Try to get this movie, wait til its about 11:30 at night when everyone else in the house is asleep, shut off all the lights except for maybe one in the next room so it creates a creepy floor shadow...and turn this movie on. Needless to say I didn't want to go to sleep after watching this movie because I didn't think I was gonna wake up without those claws jutting out of my stomach. After watching this film that really made Wes Craven, I was horrified. This is by far one of the greatest horror movies ever. Made in the decade of some of the best horror films ever made. Made in the era of blood and gore. This movie perfected every little thing the 1980's were all about. I was afraid for 2 weeks after watching this movie. I had to watch it again just to try to convince myself it could never happened. It didn't work but eventually I got it out of my system. One thing I didn't like...the ending...because it lead to Freddy's Revenge (sucked)...leading to Dream Warriors (not bad)...leading to Drewam Master (bad)...leading to Dream Child (WORST)...leading to Final Nightmare (at least its over? nope)...leading to New Nightmare (good)...basically any movie with Nacy as the main character and Wes Craven as either Director or Screenplay is decent horror...everything else tries to hard to be comedy...'A Nightmare on Elm Street' TERRIFYING THRILLER FROM WES CRAVEN! 9/10 P.S.-If you want untraditional Wes Craven, but still a good movie...go see Red-Eye",9,1,2,22 August 2005

","This movie is one of the most complex and interesting science fiction films to date. This movie is slick, sexy, and has so much style its amazing. Guns, leather, blood and gore, slow motion, flips and all that cool stuff that everyone wants in an action movie. The reason this movie is such an achievement is because it achieves all the cool things that people want to see in movies, but at the same time, is NOT mindless. The story behind this action packed thrill ride is one of the best ever told. Job well done to the directors, cast, and Special FX team.10/10...one of the best",9,0,1,24 July 2005
Click," Fantastic in so many ways...
","This is a movie that is unlike any other Adam Sandler movie you will ever see. Not only is it funny, but it is something to learn from. This movie, unlike many of Sandler's, delivers a powerful message about loving the simpler things in life. The movie starts off a bit slow, but quickly picks up once you get into it. The movie is very funny, most of the situations and jokes you can very easily laugh at. Towards the end you start to see what skipping the bad things in life can really make you miss. The movie will make people realize that the bad times are worth living through because good times lie ahead. If you don't pay attention to the little things you love in life, like a daughter, or a son, or a beautiful wife, things some people take for granted, you may lose them. It makes you understand that so many people don't realize what they have until it's gone and 'Click' drove this message into your head with it's almost tragic ending.As for performances, as always, Beckensale is stunning, and delivers a good performance for the given character. Every age of son/daughter of Sandler's character Newman gives a good performance (especially his son at an older age). Walken is a little bit creepy, I've never found him to be too good of an actor, but I suppose he plays the part well. As for Sandler, surprisingly, his performance was the best in the movie, along with the Fonz...This is Sandler's best performance (along with Punch Drunk Love). He comes at the audience surprisingly, delivering the goods in his comedic, and stunningly heart-wrenching performance in 'Click'.See this movie, you will be changed.9.5/10",7,2,10,26 June 2006
