The Blair Witch Project," Teens set out in the woods of Burkittsville to document the legendary Blair Witch
","The Blair Witch Project....a movie that re-sparked the found footage genre. Maybe it was not quite 'dead' but this movie definitely set the standards for found footage films for years to come. The biggest challenge horror movies face is whether they can actually scare the audience. And it becomes more difficult when you are showing little or next to nothing in terms of things 'jumping out.' The Blair Witch Project hits all the high points suspense, terrifying, edgy and has you on the edge or your seat wondering what will happen next. If you haven't seen this film already, or if you are looking for a great found footage film I would put this at the top of your list.",9,2,4,27 April 2017
