Blade Runner 2049," Just more violence against women
","The most grotesque display of violence against women I have seen in a while. Nudity and grotesque show of sex. a woman is birthed out of a zip-lock bag and two minutes later is sliced through the stomach to make some sort of point. What it was, I cannot say. The main 'villain' chick is choked and drowned by the main 'hero'.Just a terrible movie. Worst $18 i've spent in quite a while. This goes in my 'bad life choices' column.",2,14,30,7 October 2017
