Mission: Impossible III," Good.. But could be better
","I just returned home from the theater and I have to say that I was impressed with the film but I think that it could have been a lot better. There were many 'coincidences' that really took away from the overall effect of the film. For example, Hunts girlfriend being a Nurse, Ending up in the hospital in China and needed a defibrillator to fry the explosive chip in his brain. That whole series of events took away from the originality of the 'chip-in-the-brain' idea. Also, it seemed that the originality of the writing fell short of the previous two films. I felt like the writers were pulling many elements (Like equipment and 'moves') from the previous two films without coming up with new and inventive ideas. It seemed to me that the 'Inside guy' was VERY VERY predictable. On the plus side, I think that the casting of this film was perfect. Tom Cruise (whether you like him or not) is perfect for these roles, Hoffman was THE PERFECT villain, and Fishburne played an excellent part. Overall, this will fit well into the MI franchise, but it does not live up to it predecessors. Mission Impossible was defiantly the best in this series. I recommend that you see this in the theaters - you will not be able to appreciate this films special effects and action sequences without the big screen atmosphere.",7,0,1,6 May 2006
