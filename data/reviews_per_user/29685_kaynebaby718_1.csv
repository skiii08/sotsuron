The Benchwarmers," This Movie Was Awesome!
","If you're a Jon Heder fan and you liked 'The Bad News Bears' (with BillyBob Thorton) then you will love this movie! It was hilarious! I thought it was gonna suck huge and be a typical weird junky movie. But after I watched it at an advanced screening of it the day before it came out, I was like 'Whoa!'. This movie is so random. You never know what's going to happen next! If you're stiff, stingy, uptight and boring, don't watch this movie. If you're crazy, a big fan of Jon Heder, a big fan of David Spade, and a big fan of Rob Shneider then watch it! You'll be surprised on how good it is! So go out and waste ten bucks! It's worth it!",8,0,3,9 April 2006
