Requiem for a Dream," Simply The Best
",This has to be the best movie ever made. I've never walked out of a theater that stunned. I tell people this movie will blow your mind and break your heart. Can't wait for Aaronofsky's next film. I can't imagine how he can top this one although I know he will prove me wrong.,10,0,0,24 May 2001
Chicken Run," Hysterical
",I bought this video for my nephew and could not resist watching it before I gave it to him. I found this movie to be one of the funniest things I've seen in a long long time. The animation (claymation) is flawless and the dialog is brilliant. I'm so glad I did not see this in the theater; I was laughing so much I would have been asked to leave. Chicken Run - its not just for kids!,Null,0,0,11 December 2000
