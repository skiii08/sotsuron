The Avengers," Definitely a movie I can watch 1000 times over!!!!
","Having seen the previous Marvel movies, I have to say this was probably their best work so far. This movie caters to all ages with plenty of laughs and OMG moments. Sure, the beginning had a bit of a slow start, but once it got on its feet, WOW! Iron Man had a big part in this, being the hilarious, immature playboy to Thor and Captain America's more serious nature. Scarlett Johansson played the part of Black Widow perfectly and Hawk-Eye and the Hulk were both splendid. The villain, Loki, stepped out of the 'typical bad guy' shadow and made the perfect enemy for these amazing heroes. The effects didn't have that sick, CG look a lot of other hero movies have and the plot was believable. I'll admit, I shed a few tears in some scenes, but seconds later, they brought the laughs right back. Overall, an excellent family movie!",10,7,15,10 May 2012
