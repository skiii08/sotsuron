The Blair Witch Project," Next to 'Summer of Sam'... the worst movie of the Summer
","The only thing frightening about this movie is I paid good money to see it. Let me sum it all up for you.  Three fools go out into the woods to find some evidence of the Blair Witch.  After a couple of days and nights they determine they are lost and cannot find their way out of the woods.  These three losers couldn't find their way out of a paper bag with both ends of it opened.  There was nothing in this supposed real footage to lead a rational mind to believe there was anything strange or unexplained going on out there in the woods. That three people could wander off into the woods, get lost, place the blame on each other, and begin seeing things which weren't there (nothing showed up on the film) is believable enough.  I believe what really happened is these three shot the video and film and left the video and film in the woods where an accomplice could find it.  Then playing on the old Blair Witch stories and their own staged disappearance (remember no one was able to find any trace of them, their camping gear or cameras) the video and film were sold to the movie makers and at last count this  no budget movie had made over $30M!",1,0,2,2 August 1999
Catch Me If You Can," I Caught the Show...I'm Glad
","Top-notch job of acting by Leo, Tom and Chris.  A different type of story for Steven Spielberg, but the story was very interesting (made all the more so because it all really happened).  Leo was much more believable in this role than he was in Gangs of New York.  This movie will sell lots of tickets and break the $100M mark during its run.  Catch it while you can...a strong 9.0 out of 10.",9,0,0,26 December 2002
Lost in Translation," Just Lost
",I rented the DVD and I kept watching for 102 minutes trying to make sense of it.  What I saw was a nineteen year old lonesome female and a fifty-four year old lonesome male staying in the same hotel in Tokyo.  I wouldn't expect anything real dramatic to happen between two people at opposite ends of the age spectrum in the real world and absolutely nothing happened between the two main characters in this film.I find it laughable so many people who commented on this film categorized their words as 'spoilers.'  How can you spoil a film which is rotten from minute 21 to minute 102?P.S.  Bill Murray still has not performed in a dramatic role worthy of critical acclaim.  Stick to comedy Bill.,5,0,1,15 February 2004
Man on the Moon," Wait for the Video
","Great performances by Jim and Danny...possible Academy Award nominations. No new info in the film...just reruns of SNL, etc...some with the original players/some with different players.  Did anyone else notice the absence of Louie in the Taxi recreations?  Guess they couldn't find anyone to play Danny's part.  The movie is certainly worthy of your money, but be thrifty and wait for the video.",7,0,0,3 January 2000
Seabiscuit," The Biscuit Wins It Going Away
","My wife and I had the pleasure of seeing this movie at a preview showing in Colorado Springs on 7/22/03...many thanks to the sponsors.Best family drama based on a true story I have seen in a long time. Superb acting by Tobey, Gary, Jeff, and Chris.  Tension-breaking performance by William H. If you read the outstanding book of the same title, then you won't be short-changed at the theater...only some of the more seedy elements of horse racing and of the jockey's lives have been left out of the screenplay to ensure a PG-13 rating.This movie will make over $200 million hands down.  It probably won't do as well on the international market based upon the British guy's comments ahead of mine, but then this is an American story.
P.S.  This movie and its actors will win Oscars.",9,0,0,22 July 2003
