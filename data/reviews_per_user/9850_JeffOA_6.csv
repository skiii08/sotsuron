Ford v Ferrari," Dumbed-down but fun
","Le Mans '66 is a fun movie despite having an overly dramatized plot. In a way this is your usual Hollywood action/drama flick with little to no regard to respecting how events originally occurred. Lifting inspiration from incidents happening around its main people - Miles and Shelby - and integrating them into their story making it more thrilling but also less believable. Ken Miles' life had enough for a whole movie but they rather incorporated made-up drama than telling about his war experience or perhaps showing that the other drivers are not just there as simple antagonists. The handling of the 'Ferrari deal' is also laughable, distorting history for the sake of extra drama. I am the first to point out that Le Mans - the '71 movie - was a kind of special something, going to the extreme with its focus on motorsport while FvF went to the other extreme where human drama is the most important and the writers did not hesitate to alter facts and sacrifice character integrity in order to serve a thrilling story. In my book this is an inferior attempt at a historic biography/racing film.",6,1,1,20 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," A mishmash of ideas
","Ragnarok while being a fun movie felt extremely dull regarding overall tone and execution. Two stories mashed into one movie.
It has fun moments like the arena planet scenes, but the Ragnarok part of the plot is rather tone deaf. Odin's 'scene' is rushed and void of emotional impact. Acting is weird at times, especially Loki's lines were delivered weirdly at a few places and the writing/humour falls flat often throughout.
Moreover the directing is rather mixed too, resulting in failed moments and causing some of the problems mentioned before. Because of this action scenes often shot in a way that eliminates tension and impact. The army massacre scene was particularly unbelievably weak. The CGI is rather inconsistent too. Some of the scenes were really unimpressive, felt half-complete while others looked cool.
I would also add that the visual and musical style also felt weird, the film having a kind of 80s vibe, with almost game-like sequences with pumping 'rock' music then of course the usual mythological-superhero crossover music came in at a few places. This further adds to the confusion whether this supposed to be an action oriented, fun movie or a more cataclysmic story of destruction and loss. In the end the dual story line might have been the biggest issue in the movie. These are two very different sides of the same universe and does not add up to a coherent experience.
My favourite scenes from the movie that I really liked are definitely from the arena. Though there are problems there aplenty too like Hulk being advertised as a killing machine then after the fight showing him as a sobered down version of himself joking around and being adorable. This is weird as hell. I would even call this lazy writing which is nothing new in this genre.
Another thing which is not really an issue for me but which can be a kind of lore-breaking decision is to cast a mixed race woman as a valkyrie. Though once again I am not sure how accurate this based on the comic books but mythologically it seems to be rather conflicting. Nevertheless it was not a huge thing overall, and on the other hand I am quite happy with Heimdall's portrayal to be honest.
Overall based on my first watch Ragnarok felt a rather rushed movie with mixed execution. The Thor series is the weakest of the standalone ones (on the level of the Hulk movies maybe), Ragnarok being the latest and possibly the best so far. I am sure that the character and related universe can be used to come up with a great story but so far the Thor franchise was let down by filmmakers. This film was a great chance to prove the worthiness and relevance of it but they wanted a little bit too much and tried too hard to be bigger and more filled than the previous resulting in a chaotic mess.",6,1,2,8 June 2018
Legends of the Fall," Overrated, melodramatic
","My girlfriend wanted me to see this movie for a while now. Well, after checking it out a few days ago I have to say I have mixed feelings about it.
Without going into spoilers the film lost its seriousness right in the first 30 minutes (with the war scenes and stuff). It is dumb and overly dramatic. The context is extremely bare-bones and badly presented - similarly to Ad Astra. Some of the scenes are actually laughable, like the death scenes which I would call downright ridiculous. Maybe 1/4 of the movie worked for me, everything else was more funny than not which includes writing and acting too. Perhaps LotF is not for me, even though I really liked Joe Black with some of the same cast. Perhaps the story is rushed which makes some of the character moments seem illogical, or I just cannot understand what drives these people to do what they are doing. Perhaps this is a movie about stupid people and how good Brad Pitt looks and that he can get everything while still being a jerk. I don't know.
What is actually good in Legends of the Fall though is the music, which while not going to be one of my favourites definitely adds a lot to the movie. As I see it also got an Oscar for cinematography. That came as a surprise to me. Maybe the bad writing took me out too much to see the artistry here...",5,1,2,17 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," Surprisingly average
","It took some time for me to get around this movie. Was really looking forward to it, maybe that was the reason it took so long, finding the appropriate mood and day to check it out in 4k on my tv.
Finally I managed to watch IW a few days earlier and it went by rather fast and felt to be an unfinished movie, like it should be. But it felt to be lackluster too and also highly inconsistent in terms of writing. Like how the movie starts and how it progresses regarding the villain's actions. Like his personality is shifting based on the part of the movie, being overly violent, then dismissive later on. I sympathize with Thanos' character but the movie clearly wants to make him an indisputable evil lots of the time, however I look at it, and wanting you to understand him at other times, which just feels highly inconsistent once again. In addition all the new tech/powers associated with either side are breaching into the territory of 'anything goes' leaving lots of plot holes and leaning into convenient writing. There are no rules anymore, the story dictates what happens to whom which breaks the suspension of disbelief a bit. Lots of stuff is going on here, and the disjointed nature really shines throughout. There are too many people perhaps featured in this film. It might feel rushed but it definitely cannot leave enough space for development. The humour felt rather tacked-on in a lot of cases. Like almost every scene has to include a few jokes at least. It felt tiresome by the third one.
Overall, without going into further rumbling, I can tell that I enjoyed IW but felt nothing especially special towards the end. The whole movie feels so unimportant and it heavily goes overboard with some (supposedly temporarily) actions. I liked Avengers much more with its more grounded approach and these huge risks, like the fate of the universe are really outdated at the moment and just make for dull movies overall.",7,1,3,20 November 2018
Mission: Impossible II," Hard to watch, easy to forget
","I did not really watch the Mission Impossible movies until lately. I only saw some of the earlier entries in TV many years ago. Recently I started from the beginning. The first one was a good film overall. The second however is a different story. Some of the trademark elements are on the top here, like the frequent use of lifelike masks and the top-notch action scenes. Still, I had a hard time watching this title throughout. Somehow the directing made it a chore to enjoy. Melancholia was a daydream compared to this. Otherwise, the story was pretty dull, the whole character and romantic progression was awkward. I did not feel the connections believable and rushed. Of course, this is an action movie, but still it needs to be coherent. If one part of the experience is weaker than it is needed to be put on the sidetracks, not in the front as the main motivation.",5,3,4,25 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A movie of extremities.
","A note before the actual stuff: I did not see the movie in the theaters as it is almost impossible to see anything in its original form (regarding audio language) in my country. I already had bad experiences with Ultron for example, which was quite bad due to the misuse of voice talents. Although I would not say the movie was actually any good either. Also, I had the pleasure to watch the extended cut, which is half an hour longer than the theatrical version. Getting to the point the whole movie is all over the place due to the extremely inconsistent writing. It is not unusual nowadays when movies like Prometheus come out with extremely dull plots. Most of these films feature a few scenes which are good, while the whole thing just would not add up into a coherent overall. This is the exact case with BvS, as it is pretty much about a few over-the-top scenes. These parts are good, they are well directed and realized on film. If someone goes for the story, well it is the most simple thing that you can possibly think of. Faithful is another word I would not say when talking about the movie as both Batman and Superman seem distant compared to the ones portrayed in earlier movies and comics. I personally enjoyed the movie, it was not too long even with the 3 hours long playtime. It had enough space for characters at least, even if the motivations and other stuff was not realized too well. I am really starting to hate Eisenberg, as I pretty much see the same acting over and over again from him. Extremely irritating. Speaking of the casting, the young Bruce Wayne also seemed out of touch. The more bad-ass Alfred is another thing, but he fits the darker mood well. While the god thing was pretty much underdeveloped, it had a few decent moments mostly due to the visual style. It is something always nice to see. I would not call this movie bad, but it is definitely not a good DC movie. One of the most developed universes out there, and still cannot produce a decent plot for a movie which already has a great premise. I had big problems with the story of the seventh Star Wars, but I would say that was a worse movie overall. BvS is just the movie I would rate 6.5 if I would be able to. For now I would settle with a okayish 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,23 August 2016
