The Avengers," Very average action film
","All I can say is that I am very unimpressed with this film.The action is not too satisfying and very predictable, the acting is passable, the dialogue is at a strict minimum and the story is pretty much non-existent. In short, it's a whole bunch of CGI and explosions put together. Similar to Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The only strong point of this movie is the cast, but in my opinion this goes to waste because none of them are really given any interesting material/context to work with.I suggest you avoid it unless you're a die-hard comic fan or if you really want to see Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and RDJ together on screen and fantasize about them.",6,5,11,7 January 2013
