Walk the Line," Good, but not great!
","It's a known fact that director James Mangold makes great movies. With 'Cop Land' he set a new standard for cop films and with 'Identity' he blew us away. Now he takes on the life of one of musics most influential icons, Johhny Cash.First off Mangold cast moody actor Joaquin Phoenix as Cash. Phoenix's performance as Cash is so convincing, you think you're watching the real Johnny Cash. As for Reese Witherspoon, she took on the role of June Carter the longtime love interest of Johnny Cash. Reese is so incredible in this movie, especially as she trades one liners back and forth with Joaquin.The only flaw in the movie is the plot, that's been done so many times in movies. Instead of showing a unique look into the wild life of the famed singer, director James Mangold instead has made a movie about fame and drug addiction. By ignoring actual events that happened in Cash's life, this movie just comes out looking like another watered down studio flick.",5,2,11,20 November 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Another Successful Mission For Tom Cruise
","After waiting years for the third installment of the Mission:Impossible franchise, it has finally come. Since the last film, Tom Cruise has had several hits at the box office.But after getting bad publicity about his love life and his aggressive way of promoting Scientology, many people didn't think M:I3 could live up to the hype. But with a great script and brilliant direction from J.J. Abrams, Cruise has once again proved that he's Hollywood's most untouchable celebrity.Mission: Impossible 3 is a well put together action thriller that rivals the first two films. The Film shows Ethan Hunt as more of a regular person who's put in a tough spot, instead of a cockey secret agent. Overall M:I3 is a well directed action thriller that is worth watching over and over again.",8,0,1,5 May 2006
The Bourne Identity," One of the best spy films around
","This story has been done several times in the past, most recently in 'A Long Kiss Goodnight'. It's also true that Doug Liman and the producers created their own Jason Bourne mythology,since this movie is different in many ways to the book. But the truth is Liman takes an old story and puts a new fast paced spin on it.Matt Damon stars as the enigmatic assassin who just wants to figure out who he is. As he travels from city to city he's followed by CIA agents who want to dispose of him to save their own jobs. He's helped along the way by Marie played by the brilliant Franka Potente. Together they come face to face with the people that want them dead.The cast is great and so is the story. This film should be on everyone's top ten list.",8,93,121,23 October 2005
The Machinist," A mind bending thriller
",The Machinist fist gained popularity from the record setting weight loss that lead actor Christian Bale under went to film this movie. Bale looks like a talking zombie and because of that it gives his performance a more twisted edge. In this twisted story Trevor Reznik is a machinist whose physical appearance and attitude begin to concern his co-workers. When a mysterious southern man begins to appear everywhere in Trevor's life it sets off a chain of events that causes him to question his sanity.Bale transforms himself into Trevor so brilliantly that you forget it's him just playing a role. Jennifer Jason Leigh helps the story along as a prostitute named Stevie and is a good equal to Bale's intense presence on screen.,7,1,1,4 August 2005
Batman Begins," The best movie of 2005
","'Batman Begins' is the best batman film made so far. While Tim Burton's 1989 movie is already a box office classic, Batman Begins has all of the gritty power that made Batman famous in the first place. Chris Nolan has done what Tim Burton and Joel Shumacher couldn't do, which is make a comic book film true to the actual comic. While Nolan's direction is amazing David s. Goyer's script is great. The film starts with a tortured Bruce Wayne traveling the world, when he meets his soon to be mentor Henri Ducard played by Liam Nesson. his training wins him a spot on Ra's Al Ghul's League of Shadows. Bruce decides to pass on the proposal and heads back to Gotham. Soon we see Bruce transform into a fierce hero bent on cleaning up his city.The film's supporting cast including Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine make Batman Begins far more than just a kids movie. The only mediocre part of the film comes as Katie Holmes's performance as Rachel Dawes. Other than that, this picture is worth watching over and over again.",9,5,6,24 July 2005
Saw," One of the best thriller's of all time
","When this movie first appeared in theaters 2 years ago it was dismissed as nothing more than your average slasher flick. But as people started watching they realized it was much more. Rookie director James Wan manages to tell a story that not only keeps your attention but has you hanging on every word the characters say.With a small budget and a cast of second rate actors 'Saw' managed to bring in a surprising $55 Million at the box office. The film starts with two complete strangers waking up in a filthy room together. They soon must figure out who put them there and why. The film takes you on a roller-coaster ride from start to finish.Overall, 'Saw' can be ranked up there with thrillers like 'Physco' and 'Seven'.",8,0,2,2 February 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A fun action movie with great chemistry
","Director Doug Liman, who's gotten famous for making fun movies like 'Swingers' and 'Go' has successfully blended together action and comedy.In 'MR.and Mrs.Smith' Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt star as John and Jane Smith a mild mannered couple with dark secrets. But while on a routine mission the two discover they're both assassins working for two competing Agencies. The film them becomes a fast paced chase movie filled with high octane action scenes and rapid fire comedy one liners. But then there's the plot that kind of disappears with the explosions and fight scenes. The story seems rushed and flawed with a hint of a typical spy movie. When it comes down to it the only reason to really see this movie is to see Jolie and Pitt share the silver screen.",6,1,3,24 July 2005
War of the Worlds," A disappointing film from the team that you Minority Report
","Spielberg said this film is based on the H.G. Wells novel, but it just comes out looking like a cheap sequel to Independence Day. While the script was changed to take place in modern times it took away the raw chemistry of the book. As far as casting goes, Tom Cruise gives his regular pretty boy saves the world performance. Besides the silly special affects and the strained script, the best part of this SCFI blockbuster is Dakota Fanning. Fanning who's only 11 years old upstages the great Tom Cruise with little trouble.But with this in mind, Spielberg still manages to keep the audience's attention like he's always managed to do. Overall 'War of the Worlds' may top $200 million, but that still doesn't make it an instant classic.",3,9,14,24 July 2005
Wedding Crashers," This movie was yet another hit from the 'Frat Pack'
","Wedding Crashers follows the same formula that made hits out 'Dodgeball: A true underdog Story', 'Old School' and ' Starsky and Hutch'. It flows with fast paced humor, great comedic acting yet it has a predictable plot. But this rude and crude comedy brings you back to the classic days when comedies like 'Animal House' ruled the box office. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn bring a strong presence to the silver screen, with Vaughn's motor mouth humor and Wilson's surfer guy comedy. This movie also has a great supporting cast like Rachel Mcadams, Christopher Walken, Jane Seymor and a few surprise guests. This film is worth every dollar.",8,1,3,20 July 2005
Fantastic Four," A mediocre comic book movie
","When this movie was first set to be made in the late 1990's with Chris Columbus attached to direct, it became every comic book fan's dream come true. But after years of delays and script rewrites Columbus dropped out and the studio had the brilliant idea of signing a untested director to head the picture .Tim Story's only major film was the lame comedy 'Taxi' and yet he landed the job to direct a movie based on comic's first family. Story's fist mistake was casting Jessica Alba as Susan Storm. Her weak and wooden performance makes her co-star Chris Evans, who was badly cast as The Human Torch seem as a small problem. But then there was Michael and Ioan who were cast as The Thing and Mr. Fantastic. These to actors made the movie a little better to watch.But when it comes down to it Tim Story trades in action for a lame family comedy. This film had the potential to be a great action adventure film but it turns to be just another so so comic book movie.",5,0,1,24 July 2005
The Runaways," The Runaways- A very well directed, well written film.
","I'm a big fan of Joan Jett and her hit singles Bad Reputation and I love Rock n Roll. I do have to admit I had no idea that she was in a band called the runaways early on on in her career. When I first began researching the origin of the group I became fascinated who the idea of a big screen movie based of the band's story.The Runaways got my attention because it was about one of the first all girl rock band's assembled. Dakota Fanning plays the band's lead singer, Dakota is always good but I have to say that in this film she was overshadowed by actress Kristen Stewart who plays Joan Jett. When I heard that Kristen Stewart would be playing Joan I was very disappointed, we have to admit that she's not one of best new actresses we have, but in this film she definitely proved me wrong.Overall, Runaways is a good film with a little bit of The Doors mixed in with a teen movie all rolled into one.",6,0,7,19 June 2010
The Island," Another fast paced action film from Michael Bay
","Michael Bay goes deep into the world of science fiction with 'The Island'. The plot starts with Ewan's character discovering that the perfect society he's living in isn't real. He soon sets out to prove this theory with his love interest played by Scarlett Johanson. They escape and become the target of a city wide manhunt.To prevent the world from discovering the secret that clones are being created, a government commando is put in charge of the chase. They're helped out by regular people but soon must face the corporation that wants them back. This movie has everything a action junkie could want, amazing mind blowing action scenes and a beautiful female lead. The only thing that doesn't live up to expectations is the thin plot.",7,42,79,24 July 2005
