Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good, but I like Volume 1 better
","I feel that alongside Death Proof and Hateful Eight, Kill Bill Volume 2 is one of Tarantino's weaker movies. It's a good watch, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't really hit me the way Volume 1 does. I'll talk about the positives. The acting is amazing, as is the dialogue, direction, and action scenes. My main negative is the scene where The Bride steps on Elle's eyeball after gouging it out. It was an extremely unnecessary shot to cut to. My second to main negative is the anti-climactic death of Bill. I would have preferred a sword fight over the 'nerve poke' or whatever it was called. Other than those two, I recommend this movie big time.",7,1,1,9 April 2020
Sin City," Very cartoonish looking
","I love the minimal use of color. The acting is good. The black and white really adds to the gritty tone. However, the fighting scenes look very cartoonish and unrealistic. Some of the practical effects look cheap as well. I'm giving it a 7/10 because the story is amazing, but it's a little rough aesthetically.",7,0,1,7 May 2020
