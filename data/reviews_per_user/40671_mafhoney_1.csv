Ali," ALI Okayest not Greatest...
","Might I first say, I am a huge fan of Michael Mann and Will Smith DESPITE this film.WHAT WENT WRONG WITH THIS FILM?Well, first the movie was way too long, almost three hours total (the last thing this movie needed were slow motion sequences, but Mann felt differently and put them in at any chance he could).Second the movie was way too muddled and jumbled to be enjoyable to the novice viewer. It could never quite make up it's mind whose story this was about. Was it's Ali's story? Malcom's? The Islam Nation's? The U.S. Army's?
Third, Will Smith is a more than fine actor but in this role he never quite reaches the mark. There are times he has Ali's rhythm of speech and nails him 100% and then other times he is so off the mark you are reminded of his Fresh Prince days.  Physically you can tell Mr. Smith dedicated himself to changing his body to look more like Ali but in the fight scenes he is still so significantly smaller than Ali was that he looks silly. (FOOTNOTE: There is one bearded actor who is a photographer at the fight scenes, this man looks EXACTLY like Ali that at times it's terribly distracting. I found myself screaming 'HIRE THAT GUY-- HE'S YOUR ALI!')Fourth, Jon Voight is good as Howard Cosell but the makeup is so terribly distracting that you are reminded at every moment that its really Jon Voight in heavy make-up.The out-and-out winner of this film is Jamie Foxx, who was excellent in this break though role. It might also be added that another impressive actor in a smaller role was Van Peebles as Malcom X.Overall, let's just say you learn nothing new in this movie about Ali's life.  I knew very little of Ali going in to the theater and even less going out. Sadly, as a viewer you are really left more confused then enlightened about this great American sports hero.",Null,0,0,27 February 2002
