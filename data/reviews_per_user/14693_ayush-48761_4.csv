Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvels Blueprint
","Do you guys know about the marvel blueprint or formula that these movies are known for? you know the action packed movies with enormous amounts of jokes within them. Yeah well this was the catalyst of it all, but this is the orginal and James Gunn brought his A-game. The themes explored are so touching like family, motherhood, loss and friendship. Jokes are all on point and probably the funniest in the entire marvel cinematic universe. Great CGI and amazing action.
