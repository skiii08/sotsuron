The New World," long story
","I love history and both my boyfriend and I were excited to see this movie. We had heard and read many good comments about it. But when we actually got to watch it, it was 2 1/2 hours of wasted time. Yes, the scenes were beautiful, but that cost the story line. Sometimes I didn't know what just happened. And if we had not had the closed captioning on, almost half the movie would have not been heard or understood. They speak so soft that one may have missed half the movie that way. If you want to see it for the scenery, go right ahead, but I did not benefit by watching this movie.",4,5,8,16 May 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not as good as the first one....by far
","Well, seeing as I saw someone actually say something good about the Pirates of the Caribbean 2....um, I'd like to let everyone know that if you have any good expectations for this movie, you will be thoroughly let down. I was completely let down and have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life! I LOVED the first Pirates of the Caribbean but this one was like 'we've lost all our money soooo...lets end right about.....HERE!' Oh, and Keira Knightly forgot how she even talked in the first one and has a completely different accent lol. The friends that went with me couldn't believe how the movie ended up being. We went the first weekend it was out. Pirates of the Caribbean failed to make any good impact on our good time together. I thought it my duty to not let people think that movie was something that it was not...which is good.It's a 2 just because Johnny Depp is still decent in the movie, so it's not a 1.",2,8,16,13 July 2006
