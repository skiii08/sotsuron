Iron Man 3," Just a Great Movie! The Best Solo Marvel Movie.
","I have to admit that I loved everything about this film but I did fall in love with the character the first time around. This movie is every bit as good as the first but even better in my opinion.They say luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity. Well, Avengers gave this film the opportunity to move beyond what has come before and it appears there was a lot of hard work and thought that went in to making it because it's exceptional in every way. And, we are all lucky to get to see it. Iron Man 3 is exactly where and how the character should appear after the events of Avengers. I love the idea that after the Avengers Tony basically goes a bit crazy with paranoia and builds MANY new suits of armor just to be ready for anything. This really speaks to his mindset and where he is going from this point forth. It's true character development and advancement. Sometimes it's not all for the better but that's life and that's certainly what sets Marvel heroes apart from all others. The flaws and feet of clay are on display but the emotion and relatbilty are off the charts in this film. I can say the same thing about the action. There were some thrilling things that happened in the first two Iron Man films but NOTHING like we see in this movie.It's certainly on a par with Avengers. Iron Man 3 is the best solo film Marvel has made and that's high praise indeed.",Null,3,21,25 April 2013
Captain Marvel," Yeah, real fans HATE this waste of film
","I'm sorry but this character is simply awful. A one dimensional Mary Sue with all the charm of an old shoe. Brie Larson is horribly miscast and politics take center stage over actual entertainment. If this is truly the future direction of the MCU then I weep for the ending of the greatest era in studio history. It was a great run that apparently is coming to an end so as to virtue signal. That won't be pretty. Mark my words, a sequel will not do well at the box office. Word of mouth is rightfully harsh on this one.",Null,19,37,12 May 2019
We're the Millers," Funny and Entertaining for what it is
","This certainly is cheesy and nonsensical but there really are some genuine laugh out loud moments. Some concepts they took too far (the idiot RV/DEA couple) and that really hurt the overall tone of the film. Still, you can tell that a lot of the funny lines were adlibbed based off the rather funny blooper reel they ran before the credits. Everyone was cast perfectly and you leave the cinema smiling just as you should for a goofy summer comedy. Some stuff was crass and over-the-top and I think that's why critics are all over the place with this one. Plus, Jennifer Aniston is as hot as ever and what about the young man actor that got to kiss the three TALENTED actresses in this film. He'll never get a better role in his life.",Null,2,15,13 August 2013
Avengers: Endgame," Fitting End But Very Flawed
","After re-watching yet again and digesting it all, Endgame has flaws but is a satisfying enough conclusion to the greatest movie studio run in history.Pros
<ul><li>Went back and forth on whether Cap going so out of character and choosing to be selfish at the end of the film is a positive or a negative. As of now, I like the fact that Steve chooses tits and happiness over morality and honor. The ramifications of his choice are vast and whatever the case paints Steve in a bad light when you think about it. Yet, it calls back Frigga's talk with Thor. Even heroes fail and make bad choices.</li><li>Thor and his flaws/journey. Love that Thor becomes comfortable with who he is at the end of his journey. That scene with Frigga was powerful. Thor is NO Odin and doesn't want to be.</li><li>Tony's sacrifice and his final taped goodbye. Part of the journey is the end and what a way to go out. Frankly, it makes no sense why Dr. Strange couldn't have used the Time Stone to reverse the damage to just Tony's body. Putting that aside, it really was an emotional and powerful end to the MCU as we know it. Given the downward direction of the future of the MCU, it may grow even more fitting that there is now a clear classification and border. Everything pre- RDJ Tony Stark and everything after RDJ Tony Stark. 'I AM IRON MAN' indeed.</li><li>Fanboy Fangasmic Action: Cap calling and using Mjolnir!!! Wanda's take out of Thanos! Giant-Man's left cross KO's one of those flying Leviathans from the first Avengers film.</li></ul>Cons
<ul><li>The use of 'Hippie Hulk' and his baffling lack of action and inclusion by the Russo's. Professor Hulk is a great concept but used mostly for comedic purposes sits wrong with most fans of the character. It's clear the Russo's didn't know what to do with the Hulk.</li><li>Asinine social justice seeds were so unnecessary and moved beyond annoying. Small scenes yet they were awkward and signal exactly why the future of the MCU seems to be headed in the wrong direction.</li><li>One that note, Captain Marvel being shoe-horned in to the movie was completely awful. Thank God her character was given little to do and didn't ruin the overall quality of the story. Yet, she remains a HUGE negative to anything in the MCU.</li><li>Lack of notable action until the final act and even then everything descending in to chaos and wild CGI madness. They spent far too long on the CGI massive battle and not enough time on the Thor/Iron Man/Cap VS Thanos showdown.</li></ul>",Null,0,12,12 May 2019
Thor: The Dark World," Marvel has out done themselves again. Great Film!
","Infinitely better than the first (which I liked) because of better action, humor and emotion. All those people who were worried about Thor being underpowered are going to be pleased. The effects are wonderful and it is indeed a very funny and a very moving movie in places. I'm happy to report that neither factor is overused or gets in the way of the feel or story. It's the right amount of humor and right amount of angst. Cinematography is great and the score is amazing. Whoever scored this film should do so for the rest of the Marvel movies in my opinion.I knew they would nail the pathos but was pleasantly surprised by the creative fight sequences. They are phenomenal. Not overly long but when they rage, THEY RAGE. Also, Kurse can rival the Hulk in terms of scary power. He was better utilized than the Destroyer was in the first film. Loki is the scene stealer that was all hoped to see! Jane and Sif add more than eye candy but you would expect no less from Marvel. Hemsworth has cemented his legend as Thor with this effort. My only real disappointed is a minor one. They didn't really show the nine realms in any real detail. It seemed a cop out that hey're just open landscapes. Yet, maybe they didn't want to commit to anything for future movies.Overall, this is a wonderful movie and maybe Marvel's best solo film.",Null,126,254,30 October 2013
