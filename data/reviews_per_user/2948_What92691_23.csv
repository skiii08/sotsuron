Scarface," An interesting plot, and story, with a thrill beyond usual
","Scarface has an interesting plot, and story, with a thrill beyond usual. The fact that there showing the story from a bad guys side is very interesting, this movie puts you in the brain of him, then showing that he's doing job, by job to get to the top of the drug empire reall showes how powerful he is. This story is just a bang, bang play, it's very dramatic to, a lot of yelling, the columbian cartel scene. The thrill goes up because it's like a ladder, you see him poor, having nothing at all, then one day he gets a job, he does bigger, and bigger jobs, not just the character is working his way up a ladder, but the thrill is because the bigger the job, the more dramatic, bloody it gets. Four out of four stars, good movie.",10,0,1,20 July 2003
Chinatown," A private detective who moved from Chinatown because of superstitions to L.A. gets caught up in twisted family, and what at the start was a small investigation turns out to be a big investigation, with setup
","I give this movie a 10 because it thrilled me like hell, there's great writing in the script, great camera shots, outstanding acting, and kept you thinking through out the movie, what will happen next, or maybe this will happen.",10,3,5,21 January 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Extremely interesting, a blast of fun, and not one yawn will come through your mouth while watching.
","This movie is extremely interesting, a blast of fun, and won't put you to sleep, some pirate movies are so boring because all they do is show how the pirates live. This one they accomplish that objective, and accomplish a very interesting obstacle, with a thrilling ride to keep you awake. The acting in here is another great part of the movie, Johnny Depp does a great job because every other second his eyes get bigger, then smaller and etc. Johnny Depp also walks weird the whole movie. Orlando Bloom does a tremendous job of a man who loves a woman, you can see that when he looks at her he doesn't care about anything else. The woman (i forgot her name) does a great job, she to showes that she doesn't care about anything else while she looks at him. They both really show there amount of chemistry in this movie. Captain Barbosa had a real job of it, being tremendous as a bad guy, having the accent that most pirates have, basically he plays the role of a bad guy pirate extremely good. Another great part of the movie is the script, while coming with an action sequence, the movie has bit parts of comedy, showing how much pirates like rum, how much pirates do wrong to woman, and sometimes how stupid pirates are. A great script also because of the use of language. The directing job by Gore Verbinski (also did a great job on The Ring) was tremendous again, also a big help to the actors by telling Johnny Depp to move his body a certain way. Telling each actor the way to act. Overall this movie turned out a masterpiece, thrilling, comic, interesting, dramatic, and romantic. Ten out of ten I gave it, I would suggest you see this one to if your up for a blast of fun, and a thrill.",10,0,1,19 July 2003
Ed Wood," An Inpspiration To Filmakers CAUTION SPOILERS
","CAUTION SPOILERS. If you don't want to be in the filmaker when you grow up I don't think this movie is for you because the lesson learned in the end is only for filmakers, and how to make their movies. But thing is it isn't exactly telling you how, it's telling you to do your movies however you want. Who cares what other people think about it, make your movie the way you want to make it. The last scene with Orson Welles can't be missed for you filmakers, I'd say I'd put it in the top maybe 35 best scenes of all time. All though not epic, it's amazing to bring old Orson back to life, to see him, and to hear that voice again in a movie. What a tremendous movie. I liked it because I want to be a filmaker, and I give it all stars it could be judged, according to this site ten, according to ebert two thumbs up, according to the four stars system four stars. Martin Ladaue is great as Bella Lugosi, Jonny Depp is great as Ed Wood, very funny to, then Tim Burton does a tremendous job directing it. What a brilliant idea to put it in black and white color, I though it was one of the best things about the movie.",10,0,0,10 November 2003
The Terminator," A classic Sci-Fi thriller, that took Science Fiction to a bigger height
","The Terminator is now a days a film that people judge there thrills with. After they've walked out of the theater from seing a thriller, they compare it to this one. The Terminator took the Thriller genre to an even bigger height, the Terminator to Science Fiction to a bigger height, The Terminator took cinema to a bigger height. These kind of movies started out with Alien (when I mean these kind of movies, I mean Science Fiction Thrillers, with a whole bunch of guns, not like Invasion of The Body Snatchers) went to The Thing, and then came The Terminator. The Terminator changed cinema by the stunning special effects, the tremendous plot, and story that can't get better, the creative villian that won't stop till he kills. Also in most Science Fiction films you don't have much romance, in this one you do. This also continued with a woman being the heroe in a Science Fiction film, before Alien (the movie that kind of started for woman being heroes in Science Fiction films)there wasn't a lot. The Terminator also like Alien, kept you guessing till the end, thinking is he going to get killed now, or who will get killed. Other compliments for the film are the acting, which is tremendous, Arnold Schwarzenegger makes you really fell that the villian is really bad, he makes a good job of playing a computer. Linda Hamilton is excellent because she does a great job of being scared. The writing is great, this film created a line that everybody knowes: 'I'll be back,' one of the most famous lines, right up there with 'Bond, James Bond.' If you haven't seen this film, and you love shooting, and Science Fiction, then I suggest you rent this one. Out of four stars, it's a definite ****. I'll be back.",10,0,1,4 July 2003
Alien," An SOS mining ship explores a distant planet, and when there not looking aliens come on there ship, and when the time comes they terrorize.
","I though this movie was tremendous, the best SC-FI saga of all time, I couldn't believe when the alien popped out of the guy's stomach when he was having a seijer. It's probably the best movie in SC-FI besides A Clockwork Orange, and The Terminator series.",10,0,1,21 February 2003
Taxi Driver," 10 Stars Out Of 10
","Taxi Driver really shows the mind of a criminal, why people lash out, and be violent. Of course not every criminal has the same reason as Travis Bickle, this film is brutally truthfull, which makes it a tremendous film. One of Micheal Moore's favorite films, you can see why. This has a great relationship to what the kids of columbine must've been thinking. Not to kill the bad guys, but they must've been sick of all of this scum. It's all to show this movie has a great affect, and was tremendously underestimated by the academy, as they might think this is just another New York film others think this is a tremendous film. 10 stars.",10,0,0,19 October 2003
Full Metal Jacket," A story of how Vietnam changed a mans life.
","Caution: Spoilers          This movie is a definite ten, Full Metal Jacket showes how terrible it was in Vietnam, and how Vietnam changed the lives of many. Stephen King once said to always tell the truth, and this movie is doing exactly that. It had the background of Vietnam (prostition, prejudice killing) and showes big racial differences, not only with the Viatnamese, also with blacks, and whites. You here slang put downs on black people, again and again, then when the black person dies they don't help him, but do help Cowboy, and the other white person. It showes how the Leonard changed his life, at first he was a clumsy, filled with mistakes guy, but he turned his whole life around, and made a suicide attempt. The music was carefully picked, especially Paint It Black at the end. The biggest thing is that it showes how one persons life changes just because of war. The only thing I disliked in the movie is the pessimistic look on society, when really everything isn't bad.",10,0,0,10 May 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terrible
","You come into the movie thinking well Ebert didn't like it, but Roper did, on the second thought Roper is a little easy on judging movies. So you start to think well maybe this will be a good movie. You come out of the theater saying, I HATED THIS MOVIE, there was way to much destruction, way to many chase scenes, it's a total dissapointment to all Terminator movies, it barely anything changes anything in the Terminator saga. I gave it a 5 out of 10, the only ting that made me give more points to it, because it captured me to say 'I bet you the next one will be great,' this one leaves you an ending to make you think what might happen next. Out of ****, it would be a **.",6,0,0,4 July 2003
The Shining," Jack Torrance of the Torrance family gets invited to a hotel to write a novel over the winter, which almost of all of the people at the hotel are dead.
","REDRUM, REDRUM. I would call this almost as scary as the Exorcist, once I read the book it freaked me out but to put this into images with the perfect directing from Stanley Kubrick is amazing. I would call this one of the most thrilling, and scariest movies of all time, even if this movie is over two hours long it thrills me right from the start. I would seggest if you absolutely love Stanley Kubrick this is up there next to A Clockwork Orange, Dr. Strangelove, and 2001: A Space Odyssey.",10,0,1,14 February 2003
The Exorcist," The scariest horror film of all time, and most interesting horror film of all time
","Horror films these days aren't interesting, all there is, is a guy with a mechede chasing after you trying to kill you. To many kills these days, and no scares is what I'm trying to point out. These days no horror films scare me at all, you have Jason Vorhees, and Freddy Krueger, they don't scare me, because in the movie they don't bring anything to reality. Instead this film brings the fact that you could get possessed by the devil to reality. It makes you think: 'Oh my gosh what if this happened to me,' which never happens anymore. Another wonderful thing about this film is that it remains a commercially succesful film while also showing an interesting plot, and story. Everybody's acting, and actressing is fantastic in here. I couldn't believe that Linda Blair was actually playing the role, a little girl playing an evil spirit trapped inside of a body. I know the voices of her weren't real, but her, the faces, lip talking. The special effects were fantastic, they really make William Peter Blatty's novel come alive. I saw The Sting, and I thought this was much better than that, it kept you entertained, while The Sting was constantly boring. I'm not saying this should've won Best Picture, because to tell you the truth horror films aren't the academies style. While I'm a big fan of horror films, I know what's scary, and what isn't, and this is the ultimate scare. If you aren't a big fan of the horror film genre forget seing this because this is truly for horror film lovers. This movie should be looked back at horror films to come. Four Star movie, see this right away if you haven't, and you love horror films, but be prepared for a scare.",10,0,1,22 June 2003
Gone with the Wind," A young woman tries to find love in the 1860's
","Warning: Contains Spoilers, If Haven't Seen Movie PLEASE DON'T READ Gone With The Wind is my favorite movie of all time, I'm here to discuss the reasons I love it. The acting is great for the parts, because after the first fifteen minutes you start imagining Scarlett O'hara not as Vivian Leigh, but as Scarlett O'Hara, jealous, and selfish. The same thing happens with the other characters, actors, and actresses dissapear, and the characters come in. The directing, producing, and writing is fantastic. First of all by picking the actors and actresses, second of all by taking the chance of practically putting the whole book in the movie (not the whole book, but most of it) the writing is fantastic because not many movies have been adapted like this, and I think this is the first of it's time to have each scene actually mean something. Another thing is that rarely a commercially succesfull movie is great. This is also the first epic of it's time (maybe second but close to first) and not many people have done a movie like this. Also it was a great idea to keep the audience waiting three years, that's a tip for producers who are reading this, make them waiting a long, long, long time for a great movie, then you'll get big box office money. The story is fantastic showing a young girl, selfish, jealous, of everyone who has a man, then she becomes nice, and carefull when she's poor, but once she's rich again, she's back to her selfish, and jealous self. Then at the end with nothing left, no daughter, no son, no husband, nobody to love, she see's what she has to do go back to Tara, the place where she lived her childhood, and had a great time, the place where she got through the civil war, the place with her memories in it, the place that she loves.",10,0,0,17 June 2003
Big Fish," Fantastic movie, and a tremendous adventure.
","CAUTION SPOILERS This movie had me held right in it's hand. Some of the things I saw were visually amazing, it went to a place where movies haven't gone before, it has total originality, and has great satire to it. With a lot of chuckles, especially the bank robbing scene. Most of the movie was great, and bringing you through a heart grabbing adventure, just watching all of the adventures, there very ineresting. The ending scene was great, but just the scene, the feeling wasn't that good, throughout the movie it gave you a tremendous feeling. The ending wasn't sad to me, yet just wasn't good. I can't think of a better ending because throughout the rest of the movie they close everything. He shouldn't of died though, it ended just you not wanting it to end. Which meant to me the rest of the movie was spectacular. I give this movie 3 1/2 out of 4 stars. The ending is a lot to a movie, 3 1/2 stars is great yet the ending can bring it down that half. I suggest you see this movie, if you're a girl, or in a tremendously good mood I'd say this is a tearjerker for those kind of people.",Null,0,0,31 January 2004
A Clockwork Orange," A teenager part of a crime gang gets arrested, and tries to get out of jail by being part of a change of life, and the teen doesn't know it really will change his life
","This film is brilliant, filled with satire, art, and dramatic ways shown differently. This is really the only film that showes how society is cutting down people, not people are cutting down society. Before, and after this it changed the way of film forever. The way a movie would be done, what the lesson of a movie is, and how much art does it have in it? Nobody knowes how Kubrick adapted such a brilliant thing, nobody knowes how it showed this result. I've read the book, it's tremendous as a book, but even better as a movie. It changed the way the audience looks at a character, and as funny as it is it changed the song forever Singing In The Rain. Most films are hard to see a change in a person, but I could see the change easily. Malcolm MckDowell does such a great job showing the change of the character, happy, sad, happy, he does a great job of showing this criminals whole life. The script does a great job doing that to. Kubrick made this film a mark on cinema forever, believe me this isn't the only film of his that changed cinema, but this is the movie of Kubricks that changed cinema the most. 10/10 rating, go see this once you get the chance, maybe disturbing, and if it is the first time, see it a second time, it's better.",10,0,0,19 June 2003
A Clockwork Orange," A teenager who beats up, and rapes people gets caught, brought to jail, and volunteers for a brainwash that didn't know was going to transform him, and tries to live through life.
","CAUTION: INCLUDES SPOILERS. A Clockwork Orange is a classic of all kinds, this movie points something out in society, films no longer do that, they never give you entertainment and still have a moral, or classic films give you entertainment, the best entertainment, with no moral. The only film recently that has done that is American Beauty. The book is really were everything comes from, but Stanley Kubrick did a great job adapting it, he cut out the right parts, and added the right parts. I would say the film is better than the book.Most people protest of it being brilliance because they think all this has to offer is stuff that playboy does, but no. Playboy doesn't have a reason for nudity, A Clockwork Orange does. The nudity shows how bad they are, nothing else, it's all simply for a reason. The moral in this is that everyone should get a free choice between good and evil, everyone does evil every once in a while, how could you go through your whole life without at least a punch at somebody, joking or not. A lot of movies show violence (The Matrix, The Terminator) how could you go through life without at least seing one act of violence. You simply can't, you can't watch the channel four news, or whatever channel it is.Also, everything is superb, one scene where Billy Boy, and Dim beat him up, they play the theme, and every hit, Kubrick makes sure the sound is at the exact time, I've seen all of his films, and not one of them have one mistake. Maybe in his earlier films, but Kubrick didn't notice yet what he had to do. Not even speilberg does it as perfect as Kubrick. Kubrick makes sure there's the best cinematography ever, in his films, which I like, and these days I don't see any good cinematography, ever since Conrad Hall died, he's one of the best. Kubrick noted that a film should be like music, expressions, and feelings throughout the movie. In A Clockwork Orange it was, happy, sad, happy. I pointed out another thing, there's been no film where the character started out where he was, and ended up in the end where he was. I do think Kubrick should've added the chapter to assure everyone that Alex won't go through his whole life, raping, and hurting people. And it would be a better ending, because you know that's all he's going to do for the rest of his life, get a wife, and have kids. A Clockwork Orange is a masterpiece, the book and the movie. I advise you to read to do both, not in any order, it doesn't matter. So goodbye, amen, and all that cal.",10,0,0,23 April 2003

To Kill a Mockingbird," About a family of three, prejudice, hatred, and childhood innocence
","This movie is tremendous, outstanding, excellent. One of my favorite movies of all time. I love movies that have a lesson to be learned in them, and this certainly does. The lesson in this one is to not be prejudice, and do not hate, even if there's so much in the world. You probably think I'm gay, since I'm a guy, and my screen names What 92691, which definitely is misfit for talking like this. But I'm a big movie buff, and I realized how stupid the screen name was. I'm surprised this didn't win best picture, but I'm happy it won best actor, because Gregory Peck made one of the best performances of all time. It's a short comment but that was it. I've commented on this recently the only reason I said this again is to see other comments.",10,1,2,16 June 2003
To Kill a Mockingbird," This movie is about one family the father trying to defend a black falsely accused of rape, and two kids, one a boy, one a girl who are there to show childhood innocence, and to show the point of view by the
","There are many compliments, and comments I can give about this film since it's so great. The acting is superb, each acting is perfect for showing there part of the movie, especially Gregory Peck. The characters are great, and if you've seen AFI's 100 Heroes & Villians Atticus Finch (played by Gregory Peck) is #1 on the list for heroes. The character of Atticus Finch is so great, standing against all the prejudice, and hatred in the world standing along the side of the black man. Not just the book is great, but the screenplay is tremendous, Horton Foote does a great job from getting the characters out of the book and into the movie, and does a great job showing how falsely accused the black man is. The directing is excellent, and producing. Everything is excellent creating one great movie. I would see this right now if you haven't, nobody could refuse this movie at any cost. You may find some parts sad but the children clean that up right away, plus the ending would wipe the record clean. So see this movie and at the end you'll know you haven't wasted $5 on a crappy movie.",10,0,1,15 June 2003
The Green Mile," A security guard in death row makes friends with a man that was wrongly accused, and has magical powers.
","After I saw this movie, i was definitely in aww, how great it was, the philosophy that it taught, the perspective of life it was. Most of you thought it was long, but I thought it went by to fast, some people thought the ending was corny, but I thought the ending was great, and Stephen King found his best muse (in the book: On Writing, by Stephen King, it's good you should read it) and none of his movies could compare to this one. Frank Darabont did a great job, and brought back as much drama as he did in The Shawshank Redmemption. I thought that Michael Clark Duncan made a once in a life time performance, and I would be stunned if Duncan ever acted better than this. Then Tom Hanks was great, his western accent. Even if they don't tell you he was a western folk, you can just tell by his every move. Then the screenplay was great, personally, my favorite line was: 'We've never gone four times in one night since we were nine teen.' And the art direction, oh the art direction was great, it made everything worth the movie, if you didn't have that art direction then the movie wouldn't give you a feeling like you were there. And the guy who playes Wild Billy made a once in a life time performance also, I don't think this actor will get another good role, because if you look at him, he seems sort of punkish, and probably is hard to get him to play the right role. But Frank, did a great job, and the cast director picked definitely the right people for the job, that's pretty much what I've been trying to say through these lines. Then the producer definitely did a fine job, but he did take a risk by putting the sreen time that long, because other people thought it was to long, I read the zagat book and they stated a lot of people thought it was to long (I know it's 3 hours and 8 minutes, but when you are into a movie so much, it goes by so fast). So really what I'm trying to state is that his is and excellent movie, and don't miss out on it, don't care what other people say about it, because I kind of didn't want to see this at first because I heard it was pretty long, and the ending was pretty corny, but I loved, just go for it. I gave this movie a 10, and now I'll shut my skinny white face up.",10,1,3,13 April 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best trilogy ever, spoilers
","I entered the film of the theatre expecting a tremendous film. My friend whispered in my ear 'Ready for almost the best 3 hours, and 20 minutes of your life,' I exited the theatre feeling just that. It was the best 3 hours and 20 minutes i've spent in a movie theatre, the best film I've ever seen. It's epic entertained, how great it was. The acting was spectacular, and it some of the best scenes ever composed in there, the scene where Golem falls down with the ring is one of the best scenes in movie history. The Lord Of The Rings should be remembered as the best epic of all time. Plus, what some other films don't do, it stays true to the book, instead of cutting out a lot of scenes. Finally it's done. 3 hours and 20 minutes may seem long to you, but every minute you'll be loving it, you'll lose track of time, it'll go so fast. Just make sure not to drink to much water. 10/10, you can't make a better fantasy/ epic film.",10,1,2,21 December 2003
The Matrix," A computer hacker named Neo is recruited by other computer hackers to fight the war of the war in The Matrix.
","This is my absolute favorite movie, every detail of it is done perfect. What you have to notice in this movie is that it's almost so fantasized (beeds to choose your destiny, a computer generated world, slo-mo) but yet so realistic. If you just think about it for one minute a computer generated world is so complicated to do. Since these computer hackers are from the future they could have beeds to choose your destiny, they could make a whole different world, computer generated. Since there expert computer hackers, from the future, they could do every surreal thing in here. But what most people do is think for one second or two and say 'Oh this would never happen'. It's a great movie, and it accomplishes what a Sci-Fi movie should- surreal, but real. For those of you that think I should keep dreaming, just think about it. Plus the people who jump roof to roof are aliens, the human jumping roof to roof, is from the future. This movie has definitely set an example for the Sci-Fi genre, and you definitely shouldn't think oh that got this off of Terminator, or Alien. Maybe the gun part comes in very well like Terminator, or Alien, but none of them think up of a whole different world. Maybe Star Wars, but that's in a galaxy, far, far, away. The Matrix made a connection between Earth and whole different world, which hasen't ever been done yet. I bet you there will be tons of movies that will copy off this one, not Alien, or Terminator.",10,0,1,1 April 2003
The Godfather," The innocent son of the don of a mafia gets hooked in the family business when the father gets crittically wounded.
","The Godfather is the best movie ever, also the best adaptation from a book, Francis Ford Coppola did a great job on knowing what to put in, and what to put out. I would like to point out that characters in the book have the last names of some of the people part of the movie, Anthony Coppola is one character obviously the relation is with Francis Ford Coppola, I forgot the first name but there was a Mancini as one character, the relation is the guy who did the them song's name is Henry Mancini. Also the producer did a great job of picking all Italian people, I heard somewhere that they almost picked Robert Redford for the job as Michael Corleone, somewhere on television, once I heard this I new it was one of the worst picks ever, I don't know how the producer could've picked that but the rest of the cast is tremendous. This is also great because nobody thought of the mafia underworld idea until Mario Puzo came out with the book, nobody knew how to make the book into the movie, and some people didn't think of making the book into the movie. A lot of people say the second one is better than the first, I would say no on that, because there's nothing better than the oringinal, the second one was excellent, but not as good as the first because it was as entertaining as the first, the things that almost bored me was the family situations, family crisis, not a lot of action, and shooting. In the first one the kills were more out of no where, and surprising me, like when the man went to take a leak, and on the way back the guy killed the guy, a brilliant set up. This movie is tremendous and wonder why would anybody give it a one, because I saw on the voting charts there was a 1.6, for the ones, maybe they don't recognize the excellence, and art of this movie, but I would like to say the movie is brilliant, I gave it a 10, and I hope you do to.",10,1,3,23 May 2003

The directing, producing of this is perfect, some of the best acting ever, the art directing is fantastic, costume designs fantastic, perfect is the word. This film is great to me because nobody had an idea like this one before the film, this film included great drama, not like other crime films which are just there for the explosions, and gun shoots. To me this film has the best ending ever, no ending has ever come near this one, maybe the second one came close, but nothing else. If you haven't seen this movie, and you're a big movie buff, I suggest you see this because this is the movie you can't refuse.",10,0,2,11 June 2003
