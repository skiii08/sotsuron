The Avengers," A family friendly summer blockbuster
","This would be a good movie to take the family to for a movie night, it has everything you would expect from a big summer blockbuster - lots of eye candy with fancy special effects, a simple and understandable straight forward plot, the good guys and bad guys are well defined and in stark black and white so its easy to know who to root for and against.The best part of the movie is the humor, it has a tongue in cheek type style and there are some good laughs in the movie. Its definitely a light-hearted movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.It loses some points for basically being too oriented for a kids audience, it was not really my kind of movie because its almost like a Disney theme park ride, and simple minded in a sense. It's over-rated for sure at IMDb, but not surprising, many of the comic book movies are over-rated at this site because of their wide spread popular appeal.",6,3,9,10 May 2012
Blade Runner 2049," Super slow, like watching paint dry for 3 hours - way overrated
","Blade Runner 2049 is already in the top 100 movies by rating, and this is very undeserved. I had to warn people that this movie is way, way overrated, and not deserving of all the gushing praise.First, the best points of the film are there are some good futuristic city designs and special effects, with flying cars (finally!) coming to America, and it doesn't look too CGI and fake, like in so many other films these days. They were true to the spirit of the first movie in this aspect, which is a good thing. Though its hard to understand why its always raining in L.A. in this future, which is weird, and feels artificial to give a depressed tone to the movie. There are several huge negatives going on within the film that make a terrible impression. The movie's biggest problem is the cast. The main characters are mostly played by actors who are charisma-free black holes at the center of the film. Ryan Gosling is one of them. It's really hard to care what's going on or to not have your attention wander with this guy getting so much screen time, and in so many scenes sucking the life and energy out of the movie. Another one is Jared Leto, playing one of the lamest villains seen in years. This is another guy who has no screen presence whatsoever. The other huge issue is the plot. It's both boring and uninvolving, and the pace is glacially slow. This will be one of the longest 3 hours you spend in the cinema in a very long time. Everything moves as slow as molasses, with some scenes being ridiculously long and drawn out, and for no apparent reason - no good reasons anyway.The movie only picks up a bit at the conclusion, when Harrison Ford makes an appearance, and he brings some much needed energy to the film at a very sprightly 75 years old. But it just serves to remind the audience how bad, charmless, and low energy the other actors are in the film.",3,9,19,15 October 2017
3:10 to Yuma," Russell Crowe gives a brilliant performance
","This movie shows once again Russell Crowe is the leading actor of his generation. He was incredible in giving a multi-faceted and complex role where he is a bad guy to the core but then finds redemption with an unusual friendship with a good man.The ending was a work of genius, so much going on. Christian Bale also was superb, and this is the first time I have been impressed by him.Major Spoilers**** In the end, Russell Crowe realizes he still has some good left in him, and kills his entire gang in vengeance for his friend as well as to kill the evil that was within him.Also, both major characters made confessions to each other, Crowe on why he became a bad man and Bale on the shame he had hidden from his son.The son (of Christan Bale's character) makes the decision to be a good man like his father, when he could have killed Russell Crowe and went on the bad path.Christain Bales sacrifice reawakens the small part of goodness that was left in Russell Crowe, and also cements that Bales son is going to be good like he was.There is a lot going on in the ending and it is all done beautifully.A great western.",9,1,4,9 September 2007
The Expendables 2," Better than expected, great action
","The Expendables 2 is a vast improvement on the first movie, and was surprisingly good. Some snappy action scenes deliver what the movie promises, and all the favorite 80s action stars are here, aging and old but still able to pack a punch, despite the passage of time. I think the movie lives up to expectations and then some, with good camaraderie among the cast and some funny one-liners peppered throughout, with the best ones reserved for Schwarzenegger (appropriately enough). The plot is secondary, and just an excuse for the bullets to fly. But that is OK when the action is as good as this. Definitely should be seen by all those who were into the action movies of the 80s.",8,1,8,4 September 2012
Source Code," Enjoyable thriller
","Nice science fiction thriller with good performances by the actors, worthwhile to see this in the theater.Jake Gyllenhaal seems to have hit his stride lately, picking good roles that suit him with the last couple of movies he has starred in. He does well here, as a reluctant hero who starts to piece together what is really going on in a mission to discover the details of a terror plot and identity of the terrorist in Chicago.The film is shot in an intelligent style, giving brief but significant snippets of various characters on board a commuter train and red herrings tossed in liberally to keep you guessing.It's not that original or groundbreaking, but made with high standards and care to give the movie-goer good value for their dollar and a pleasant entertainment that delivers on expectations. Its refreshing to see a movie made with these principles in mind.",8,7,14,2 April 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," A disappointed fan, a mediocre movie and the 3D was a fuzzy mess
","I'm a huge fan of Milla Jovovich and the Resident Evil movies. The last one - 'Resident Evil: Extinction' - I thought was a great movie and the best in the series so far.So I had to see this latest installment, what a disappointing and mediocre movie it turned out to be. The 3D was so fuzzy and distracting throughout the film but even if it hadn't been in fuzzy 3D it still was badly directed and poorly written, with hardly any of the signature action scenes, and all the actors were very pitiable and amateurish, with an exceptionally lame lead villain. Most of the action was blah and boring, in routine slow mo cuts. Don't go to see this movie if you want good or creative action scenes or an interesting story.Most of the actors made no impression whatsoever, with the exception of Milla and Wentworth Miller of 'Prison Break' fame. And even Wentworth Miller was given little to do, he didn't have but a handful of lines in the movie and it was a waste of his considerable talent. I really hope that he does better movies and roles in the future. I think he could become a major movie star, but not with appearing in crappy movies like this.I am giving it a generous 5 rating, and that is from a fans perspective. If I wasn't a fan I would give this movie a 3.Please let the next Resident Evil have a different director than this sub par effort had, and please let it not be in horrifying 3D.",5,67,124,11 September 2010
Hereditary," It's only horrifying to consider going to pay to see this! Warning.
","'Hereditary' is total garbage. Don't be like me, and fall for the misleading advertising surrounding this turkey. This movie is not really horror, by the way, but much more of a 'black comedy'. Many of the scenes are done in such a way as to make you laugh on purpose. But the comedy is pretty bad, even allowing for the low standards of this genre. I won't even go into the lame story - suffice it to say that its the usual setup for a horror film centered around a cursed or satanic-like family line. The story is superfluous to the movie, really, only serving as a way to setup cheap jump scares. Very cheap. I was also not impressed by the actors performances. The mother of the troubled kids in the movie seemed to be trying way too hard, and was overacting like crazy. The weird little girl was one dimensional as can be, and was obviously chosen because of the unfortunate way she looks, (like an elderly person in a child's body) The son character acted like he was 5 years old, even though he is supposed to be a high schooler. It was also very odd that he appeared to be swarthy or of Hispanic or middle eastern descent, when both mom and dad in the film were both very obviously white people. But I guess that is Hollywood these days, diversity trumps logic or even common sense!3 stars -- only for some good cinematography of the outdoors in certain scenes. An awful, over-hyped garbage horror film, that lacks real scares or atmosphere, and is more of a black comedy, but where nothing is funny.",3,23,58,9 June 2018
Star Trek," Weak science fiction movie with little relation to Star Trek
","This is a movie very loosely connected to Star Trek, they basically took the character names from the original series and threw in a cameo by the original Spock and then wrote a lame action movie screenplay that has nothing to do with Star Trek themes.But even as a dumb action movie set in the future this has little to offer. Sure, there are a few good action scenes in it, but the story is so stupid and distracting with most of the main characters being very dull and played by bad actors that the movie quickly becomes a bore to watch.The cast is largely terrible, with only two bright spots, Karl Urban as Dr. 'Bones' McCoy and Anton Yelchin as Chekov. Urban is especially entertaining as Dr. McCoy, he plays it as a homage and does an excellent imitation of the original character, voice and mannerisms. But he doesn't get much screen time, and once he goes off screen the movie loses much of its fun. Yelchin as Checkov is good too, with a hammy Russian accent and a mischievous gleam in his eye and he plays it up to the hilt.Still, these two can't stop the movie from being a failure. A confused and disjointed story line doesn't help. And with the villains being some of the lamest in history, they are dressed up as gangster thugs and dumb as rocks. Who ever thought these characters would make interesting bad guys should be fired from screen writing.",3,6,9,3 February 2011
World War Z," A thrill ride for most of it, only let down by an anti-climactic ending
","World War Z starts out with a bang, and just keeps upping the thrills from the opening scene onwards. Brad Pitt is a special UN agent who has retired and is now spending time with his family. Then in a mundane setting, they are stuck in traffic, when all hell breaks loose. Chaos and mayhem ensues, and its all done with a great sense of pace and style. Special effects are stunning, and look real. They don't have the 'fakey' look like so many of CGI does these days in most movies. It is a real summer blockbuster popcorn type movie.The ending is unfortunately a let down, and everything slows way down with a much too long scene set in a disease research facility. But for most of the movie, it is a thrilling roller coaster ride with superb special effects and a mercurial pace. Brad Pitt is excellent in the reluctant hero lead role, and this is the first time I have really liked him in a movie since '12 Monkeys'. And that is good, because he is on screen most of the time and in just about every scene, and carries the movie. The other characters all have minor roles, but the actors do well with what they are given. An atmospheric soundtrack adds just the right touch. A movie that will probably rank among the best of the Summer!",8,1,7,25 June 2013
The Hunger Games," Somewhat average and routine action adventure
","The Hunger Games had a lot of hype so since I missed it in the theater I had to see it when it came out on the DVD. Well, I thought it got off to a promising start and enjoyed the first part, up to when the village girl volunteers to take the place of her sister in the Hunger games, but after that, the movie went downhill and became increasingly boring and routine. The story line didn't have any twists and turns and was uninteresting, and the acting was just 'OK'. The only character who I thought had any spark or interest was the world-weary adviser and mentor to the kids, played by Woody Harrelson. He should have had more screen time and that would have made the movie more interesting.Besides him, I thought Lenny Kravitz did a good job in a small role, and didn't recognize him until after looking up the credits. But the other characters didn't make any impression and were all pretty much flat and one dimensional, including the stereotypical villain played by Donald Sutherland.That said, the movie did have nice wilderness scenery and some suspense when the kids are stalking one another, and is not a terrible film. Though I also didn't like how the ending was so blatant in setting up a sequel, I dislike it when movies do that. Still, overall it is a passable entry in the action-adventure genre.",6,0,1,6 January 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Better than expected
","My friend dragged me to this movie, I am usually picky and wouldn't have seen this on my own but there I was in the theater on my friends insistence watching Prince of Persia. Surprisingly it was pretty good for a summer movie meant to entertain. I was never a fan of the main actor in this movie, but he was good in the role as the Prince of Persia who was not royal born.There are lots of jumping and sequences that remind of video games where you have to do fancy acrobatics to get to the next point, and good action scenes in the movie. It kind of reminded me of 'The Mummy', but of course wasn't as good, but did have a similar vibe going on.The computer generated backgrounds were excellent and showed exotic fantasy architecture of middle eastern flavor and normally I would hate that a lot of the movie had computer graphics as backgrounds but this was done so well I have to make an exception.For other picky movie goers like me I can give you a recommendation for this movie, it is a fun lightweight summer movie and you will have a good time watching it.",7,11,17,1 June 2010
The Mummy," A great mix of comedy, adventure and horror
","I just got around to seeing this movie and was surprised at how good it was. It kind of reminds me of Indiana Jones, but has a unique feel all its own. Brendan Fraser is really good in it, I don't think I have seen a movie of his before and he was perfect in this role as a droll man of action. My favorite aspect is how the director deliberately plays the movie for laughs and is winking at the audience with some of the lines. Like when Brendan Fraser says in reply to what should they do next - 'We have to rescue the damsel in distress and save the world'. I loved that. This movie is just plain fun and actually has some really funny moments as well.'The Mummy' doesn't take itself seriously and knows that its just an entertaining comedy adventure and plays to this with no pretensions. The horror parts are all in good fun and aren't meant to be scary, this is a perfect film for families. An old fashioned movie that knows what it is and delivers on what it promises. I rate this highly because movies like this seem rare for some reason and I wish directors of today would take a look at this movie and make some more in this style.",9,6,6,8 March 2010
Terminator Salvation," Some good action but with a muddled and confused story
","Terminator Salvation has some good action scenes, with nice special effects but the muddled story is distracting. The characters are unmemorable and uninteresting, including Christian Bale as John Conner. He gives a mediocre performance, along with the rest of the cast.The story is muddled and seems thrown together, as if the writers just said 'to heck with it' and jammed it all together into a jumbled mess. It is by far the weakest of the Terminator movies.As an action movie its decent, but not spectacular. I guess if you just want to see a few action scenes with well done special effects, this will fill the bill. Don't expect anything more though.",5,3,4,3 February 2011
Resident Evil: Extinction," Very good action/horror movie
","This was a surprisingly good movie. Definitely the best one out of the three made. I think this film is somewhat under appreciated and under rated. In fact, the more I think about this movie the more I want to see it again, its that kind of movie.It had scary parts along with well done action sequences. Milla Jovovich was really good in it, you can tell she was in great shape for the movie. It was an entertaining movie to watch throughout and never got boring.Nice cinematography in the filming of the desert, and a world that was devastated in the future was presented in a believable way. The evil villain was played well by the actor and was memorable. The story moved at a good pace and made sense in the 'universe' the movie created. Some good performances by other actors also, the acting all around was better than expected. This is a movie I would consider buying and I don't think that of many movies.",8,15,28,19 November 2009
Silent Hill," One of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
","I had to write a comment upon seeing all the praise for this train wreck. This movie was about as scary as the Flintstones cartoon, but even the Flintstones could be entertaining unlike this crap movie. I'm a long time fan of horror, and this is yet another awful movie in the genre by Hollywood.Dull, plodding, and way too long, this movie actually made me sleepy. The story is incoherent, and most of the time is taken up by the female main character running around empty movie sets, looking fearful. The rip off of the Hellraiser villain Pinhead with the chains ripping people apart in the climax was especially laughable. But at least Pinhead had some witty things to say, the creature in this one just sits there with a stupid look on its face, struck dumb and mute apparently. I can't blame them, being in this movie must have been torture.TRULY AWFUL",1,9,20,23 April 2006
Molly's Game," Surprisingly good movie, more than meets the eye
","This movie is unexpected in its level of depth, for sure. I went to it thinking it would be a typical poker type thriller movie, and the advertising is a little misleading for the film, because I think it gives this impression. Instead, we get a complex and intelligent 'deep' type of film, about important, meaningful things such as family relationships and how the past can have lingering effects on peoples lives, and lasting consequences. If you like drama type movies with lots of character depth, and a movie that has lightning quick dialogue - you have to always be paying attention - the movie assumes the viewer is intelligent and is not watching it for cheap thrills or for shallow reasons, if seeing it in the right frame of mind, you will find this to be a very interesting movie.",7,0,3,16 January 2018
The Expendables," Meets expectations but could have been better
","The Expendables is a decent summer action movie, and a lot things blow up real good as expected. But it doesn't do anything that great and is really just an average action movie. It is far behind this summers best action move - Salt - and I'm baffled at how it has an IMDb rating that is much higher. This movie demonstrates that all our favorite action heroes of yesteryear have grown old, and the only one who is a modern action star of note in the movie is Jason Statham. He seemed a bit subdued in this movie and I would have rather seen him in an action movie that he starred in by himself, instead of this ensemble of washed up action stars. However, if you are feeling nostalgic and want to see long scenes with a lot of gunfire and explosions, this movie delivers in that respect.",6,3,9,23 August 2010
The Town," Great movie, Ben Affleck gains respect in a big way!
","I was one of the many folks who didn't respect Affleck's acting and when I would see he was going to star in a movie, I would avoid it. He was kind of a laughingstock in this regard. But no longer. He impressed me big time in this movie with his brilliant performance as a blue collar criminal in Boston, and was so compelling to watch in the role. I don't know what happened but his acting is top notch here and I can see him even earning an Oscar for this performance. Plus, the other main character in the movie, who is his sidekick and best friend, that actor also gave a worthy performance as a tough, loyal thug. Very good acting from both of them and it made their interplay fascinating to watch. And another good performance was Affleck's love interest in the film, played by an actress I have never seen before. She did well in her role. (Though not up to the standards set by Affleck and his buddy in the movie) This movie has some heartrending scenes and is touching at times, but is not without its flaws. I feel there was some material that was unnecessary, like the long drawn out shootout at the end. It reminded me of the movie 'Heat', but was not nearly as good. And the ending is also copied too much from the Shawshank Redemption. I'm guessing Affleck is a big fan of that movie, because he directed this movie, and the ending is basically an echo of Shawshank's ending, though with some minor differences.Still, overall I have to give this movie high marks as a crime drama with depth and great characters, with an especially great performance by Ben Affleck. Yup, I am now a fan of his and am anxious to see him follow up with more powerful and meaningful movies like this one!",8,3,7,18 September 2010
The Bourne Ultimatum," Incredible action movie
","This is the best action move released in a very long time. I read the reviews here beforehand, complaining about the shaky camera. I was prepared to hate this move because the complaints sounded legitimate and real.They were wrong. The shaky camera is there, but I found you get used to it after a short time. If you deliberately look for it you will see it, but if you just watch the movie normally its not a factor.Some of the best action scenes I have seen for many years, especially the fight with the first assassin. Later on there is an incredible car chase that also is awesome.The movie is almost non-stop action with a story that is simple but well told. Matt Damon is outstanding in the role, and easily outdoes his performance in the first two films.This was by far the best Bourne movie of the three.Highly recommended",9,1,2,6 August 2007
Knowing," critics got it wrong on this very entertaining movie
","Most critics panned this movie. But sometimes a movie can be quite entertaining despite its flaws. Knowing is one such movie. Normally Nicholas Cage I find annoying but he did a decent job in this one (surprisingly) as a drinking burned out world weary math professor.Special effects are spectacular at times although the aliens ships are lame and so are their light-halo-emitting see through bodies. Still, a subway accident disaster scene is really jarring and left me gasping for breath it was so well done.Yes, there are scenes so full of religious symbolism that it hits you over the head with a sledge hammer, and could have been toned down.Contrary to many I liked the ending. It was sad I thought, yes it was corny, but it also was a perfect vision of a dream 'brave new world'.I found the movie to have an emotional punch and this is unusual for a science fiction movie.Above all it was an entertaining movie and recommended for science fiction fans.",7,1,3,13 April 2009
Salt," Impressive action movie with a fine performance by Angelina Jolie
","I always regarded Jolie as a beautiful woman who was fun to watch in movies, but didn't think much of her acting ability. Well, this movie changed that. She gave a fine and riveting performance as a spy who is under terrific pressure by both her supposed friends as well as her enemies. She was very compelling to watch as an action star, and fit the role well with her athletic moves and lithe body along with her notable acting as a ruthless, cunning and deadly woman. This movie keeps you guessing, and has a good and interesting story line along with explosive action. Some people complained of many slow parts I noticed in other reviews, but I didn't see this at all, the movie runs at a quick pace and keeps the tempo high. As far as I'm concerned this is the best action movie of the summer and Angelina Jolie's best movie in years. I hope to see a 'Salt 2' in the future!",8,2,6,6 August 2010
District 9," Absurd ratings...just a little better than GI Joe - rise of the Cobra
","Recently saw this and GI Joe on successive days. I was blown away... by how overrated this movie is on IMDb. #26 at the time of this writing, one of the best movies ever - yea right. What a mockery of the ratings. Pretty average and mostly bad movie with a lot of cheesy action and trying to be profound with 3rd grade 'subtle' social commentary.As others have said this movie is not sci fi at all. Its irrelevant that these are supposedly extraterrestrial aliens - just like the alien ship is basically a backdrop piece of scenery. Its mostly just a marketing ploy 'Lets stick in aliens and that will draw in the crowds'This is a typical summer action movie and not even done well, about on a par with the movies Stallone used to put out. It is very annoying that the movie thinks it is saying smart things about humans cruelty to other humans as if this is some revelation.As bad as GI Joe was this movie was a bit better but its not saying much. Keep rating these crap movies in the top all time rankings and it will make IMDb ratings meaningless and amusing.",3,36,72,17 August 2009
Non-Stop," Somewhat over-hyped thriller
","I became a Liam Neeson fan when he started his new turn as an action hero in the excellent thriller, Taken. But I think this newest entry in his recent action roles is more routine and by the numbers than what some of the enthusiastic response is giving it credit for. It is a 'bog standard' action thriller aboard an airplane, and to me, it seemed a bit too goofy in places and overly contrived. It's not terrible by any means, but nothing special. I hope to see more interesting movies in this genre from Neeson in the future, because I still haven't seen any of his other action movies rise to the level of 'Taken' yet.As far as special effects and set design, the movie is strong in those departments. I think the movie is actually best in its first 3rd, there is a nice style and atmosphere built up, and the movie seems quite promising at that point. Then it slowly goes downhill at an increasing rate from there. By the time the ending rolled around I found it to have become very silly and a disappointment.",6,1,2,2 March 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Not bad
","Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol is a decent action movie/spy thriller (even with an odd title that sounds like some kind of video game) but not something necessarily to see in the theater, would make a good DVD rental I think.Tom Cruise stars once again but this time with a slimmed down team of only a few associates, with a hackneyed plot about some mad man who wants to set off a nuclear war by launching a nuke and hoping a chain reaction will occur. Really? How unoriginal can they get. Come on already. Surely they could have come up with something fresher than this.Despite the boring villain and retread plot, the movie shows off exotic locations in a nice panorama and the action scenes are on the whole pretty good, but not mind blowing. Tom Cruise still has star power, but the other actors in this film came off as dull to me and their characters were a letdown. I didn't really care about any of the characters except Ethan Hunt. To sum up - M:I 4 is worth a rental, but not something required to rush out and see right now.",6,2,8,2 January 2012
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Good but not up to the hype
","This movie has had universal acclaim and while its a good movie, it doesn't live up to all the hype in my view.The apes take too long to get smart and when they finally break free and form their army, the movie is almost over. The ending was anti-climactic and the build up too slow to get there.That said, the special effects are excellent and the apes do seem real and not just CGI cartoons, really remarkable and certainly some of the best effects I've seen in a long time. There is a definite wow factor going on in this movie for that element.The story was decent, but standard fare. No surprises and the story line was plodding along. The human actors were OK, though I didn't think any of the performances were outstanding. Workmanlike job all around is the word that comes to mind. I would be interested to see a sequel even though I didn't think the movie was all that great.",7,2,3,22 August 2011
Gone Girl," Like 2 and a half hours of fingernails on a chalkboard
","I was reading some other reviews with people saying how shockingly bad this movie was and I had the same reaction.This was the most annoying movie I have seen in a long time. The lead woman character has this really annoying and nails on the chalkboard sounding voice, and she narrates long stretches of the movie with that horrible voice. It's not just the way her voice sounds either, her vocal style and the way she uses words compounds the offense and insult to the ears. I was thinking that instead of using torture, they could just put this actress's voice in the film on repeat with a loud speaker, and strap a terrorist suspect in a chair, and he would confess to anything within a half hour! This movie is also very slow and boring, with the actors seeming to play their roles in a hammy fashion, not taking any of it seriously. It fits the movies plot though, because it is utterly ridiculous and contrived, one of those types of movie plots that no one would ever imagine happening in real life. 2 and a 1/2 hours of this was torture.",1,2,8,20 January 2015
Insidious," Cheesy
","This was pretty bad all the way around - acting, story, scare factor. If you are a horror movie veteran this can be safely skipped. The only good part was there is a hilarious scene about a seance with a goofy psychic and involves an unexpected accessory she puts on. It was laugh out loud funny. But besides that, nothing interesting. The effects are bad and very cheesy. You can tell this movie didn't have much of a budget. Nice house though, its amazing a teacher could afford a big house like that in a place like California. Yea, right. I'm being sarcastic here. This is a typical crappy horror movie like they seem to constantly make.",3,2,2,23 October 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Mediocre
","I gotta agree with those who thought this was disappointing and just blah. The script and plot were terrible, jumping all over disjointedly, and there was no sense of excitement at all, or thrills. This is supposed to be a thriller with action but it doesn't deliver on either one. The action scenes were meh and lackluster. No big payoff at the end like you might have expected either. Jeremy Renner could be good as an action star in a better movie than this, but not this one. There were several scenes that seemed shoe-horned into the movie just to have some of the stars from the earlier movies get a cameo. This was not even close to the same league of the earlier Bourne films.",5,3,9,20 August 2012
Unknown," Not so good
",This movie isn't worth seeing in a theater. It might be an OK rental. The story is semi-intriguing at first but when the main twist occurs its fairly cheap and disappointing. Liam Neeson was much better in 'Taken'. Here he is merely average as a bumbling and dull amnesiac. Its supposed to be an edge of your seat thriller but I found it lacking in excitement. I would have waited for the DVD rental if I had known the quality of this beforehand. The characters are not interesting to me in this movie. The story should have been more jazzy. I'm not saying the movie is total junk but its generic and has a made for TV feel to it.I find it hard to give this more than a rating of 5.,5,2,4,27 February 2011
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Splendid action scenes and Milla, you can't go wrong
","Another Resident Evil movie that I feel is under rated. Not as good as the third movie - Extinction, but worth watching for some crack action sequences as well as good creature and special effects. Milla Jovovich again is great in her role, and as usual a very pretty presence on the screen in her cute outfits. This movie has a lot of eye candy and is plain fun to watch. People who like science fiction, action, or horror movies would all find something to like here. I especially liked the Nemesis creature, and all the tricks it had. It was like a super 'boss' from a video game. This had some nice production values in the various sets, and it was convincing in making a futuristic setting appear plausible.",7,2,4,19 November 2009
Evil Dead," A dull and stupid exercise in gore, and more gore
","This movie is just buckets of blood and gore. Nothing scary or remotely interesting, no story or plot to speak of. All the characters are cardboard throwaways, with dumb dialog. It is hard to blame any of the actors, because they were given such terrible lines and literally nothing to work with character wise. This is the worst horror movie I have seen in a long time. It is made as a 'gross out' movie only. And that gets real boring, real quickly. I was misled by some of the reviews to go and see this, which I now think must have just been pure advertising hype malarkey. It feels like a long and drawn out two hours plus movie, even though it was only 90 minutes. Any horror movie fan can safely skip this, you won't miss a thing.",1,106,217,9 April 2013
The Adjustment Bureau," Good story but lacking chemistry
","The adjustment bureau has a pretty interesting story based on familiar science fiction themes however the main plot revolves around a couple who are supposed to be madly in love with each other but this isn't reflected on screen. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt play the lovers and the lack of chemistry between them is awkward and uncomfortable. I never felt they even liked each other let alone being crazy in love. In fact, it seemed to me Emily Blunt's character actively disliked Matt Damon's character in many scenes. Since this love story was very unconvincing and is the main focus of the movie as the story develops it takes away from the fairly intriguing story of Matt Damon accidentally stumbling into a hidden world of a Matrix-like dimension.Terence Stamp plays a powerful chief enforcer type character and I thought he was excellent in this role. By far he had the most interesting character in the movie. Another problem is there are too many celebrity cameos in the film. Well known news people like James Carville and CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Mayor Bloomberg, all these appearances are brief but still make the movie feel artificial. I'm trying to watch a movie not CNN political news.The story is a good one, if a little unoriginal and too familiar of other more successful movies in the past such as The Matrix. This movie is worth seeing but the two actors at the center kind of let down the story line.",6,1,2,13 March 2011
Black Hawk Down," Wears out its welcome
","This movie is two and a half hours long, and even though its full of non stop action and war scenes, it gets boring and drawn out. After about an hour and a half, the action started getting stale and tedious. But it just keeps going for almost another hour and its the same thing, the same kind of battle scenes, it got really dull. Also, I never got the feeling these guys were really in the action, most of them seemed to come out of the many battles unscathed and there was no real sense of them in danger.The movie is well done in its production qualities, and the camera is used to good effect with nice shots and overall its a pretty movie in the way its filmed. But the movie's tone seems to think that it is much more serious than it really is and has a fake gravitas that it gives itself, when its basically a very superficial movie.The patriotism angle is played too hard and is without subtlety, its like the movie says - look at all these heroic American soldiers and they all are so noble and brave, fighting against these black savages who appear to have endless numbers and who want nothing more than to kill them - I mean, seriously, give me a break. Plus many scenes were too composed and almost looked like a music video or something with slow-motion and corny 'African' music playing over the scene. In sum total, an over-rated war movie. The recent sci-fi/war movie Battle: Los Angeles was better than this in both the action and being fun to watch.",4,2,7,31 October 2011
Elysium," Damon gives it a good go, but the movie disappoints in many ways
","I had several problems with this movie. The ending went on far too long, leaving a bad after-taste. I also hated how the politics of the current day were injected so blatantly into the movie - I don't go to a supposed science fiction movie to get lectured about political issues (illegals). I want escapism from a sci-fi movie above all. Damon is the only thing good in the entire film. He gives it a good college try, but he can't save this movie from failure. A very awkward story line about a childhood sweetheart runs throughout, and the love interest is cold as a fish, and there is no chemistry between Damon's character and her. None of the other characters make an impression.This movie felt really clunky and unsubtle and just awkward is the best way to put it. Recycled robots from other better sci-fi movies didn't help matters. The space station, Elysium, was kind of cool, but that is about it. 5 Stars only because Damon is always an engaging presence to watch, even in a lousy movie like this one.",5,8,17,11 August 2013
Drag Me to Hell," Not bad for a comedy/horror
","This is mostly black comedy with very little horror or suspense in it. But there are some good laughs in the movie despite some weak performances by actors playing the main characters. The special effects are not scary but meant to be funny in a gross out kind of way and it generally succeeds in this aim.This movie reminded me of the old series 'Tales from the crypt' TV show. That is the kind of atmosphere in the movie, a wacky, over the top and darkly humorous plot. I did wish there was more real horror elements but all in all it is a decent lightweight movie for some laughs.",7,0,0,20 January 2011
The Descent," Overrated horror movie that is average all around
","Compared to most of the horror coming out of Hollywood these past few years, The Descent is a good movie. But that is because the horror genre has been hitting new lows courtesy of idiotic and no imagination Hollywood writers/directors for awhile now.The movie isn't a total waste of money, but is certainly no masterpiece and is merely an average film that has a couple good 'jump out of chair' moments. The creatures are OK, but silly too. There also is stupid logic in the movie. Like when the female Asian leader of the group secretly takes them to an unexplored dangerous cave system and she knows they have novices in the group who have never gone caving before?? And she has no idea of where the tiny crawlspace leads that they descend through at one point but she leads them through it anyway just for the thrill? Give me a frigging break, totally unrealistic.If you have low expectations then The Descent isn't a terrible way to spend time at a movie, but is not memorable.",6,1,4,7 August 2006
Jack Reacher," Not bad, DVD worthy viewing
","I thought Jack Reacher was decent entertainment, with Cruise doing the best he could as the main character, even though he was not really an appropriate choice for the role. I would have expected a gruffer and tougher appearing actor to have been Reacher, such as Jason Statham, for example. Tom Cruise is kind of too much of a 'pretty boy' for the role, but at the same time he does try his level best as the character, and it's a good try at any rate.One thing I appreciated about the film is the variety of locations in the scenes, from wide cityscapes to an industrial gravel pit site, to a gun range/store, there was always something interesting in the background and the movie moved along at a good clip, and didn't feel like its two hour running time.I also liked that the movie didn't do the automatic cliché romance interest that might have been expected between Cruise's character and the blonde attorney character. Often times film makers will do a romance in movies in a seemingly lazy routine, but in this one they just completely refused to do that, which was a nice change of pace. This is workmanlike movie making and that is something I enjoyed. I also thought Robert Duvall's character was entertaining playing a former marine, as a cranky but lovable old man.",7,3,9,24 December 2012
30 Days of Night," Another terrible horror movie
","This was another in a long line of recent horror movies that are very boring, crappy, and have nothing but gore in them. A bunch of badly made up vampires terrorize a town, and high jinks ensue. I'm not going to even comment on the stupidness of the plot or characters because it has been done enough already by others panning this piece of junk. If C- grade makeup and a total absence of tension or scares sound good then this is a perfect movie. What were the actors thinking? Maybe it was a good payday. The script probably brought some chuckles when they read it and then they shrugged and said what the heck, its good money. I can't believe anyone involved with this mess could have thought this would be good at any point, and it shows big time. Even the gore wasn't anything special and that is all the movie had going for it.I'm glad I got this from netflix, but honestly its not even worth a rental.",1,2,9,27 May 2008
Inception," Silly, overrated, convoluted and tedious movie
","Somehow I knew when I checked IMDb this movie would get a ridiculous rating, and sure enough... This movie is silly, tedious and way too convoluted for its own good. Not entertaining and mainly an exercise for the director to say 'Look how clever I am! I can throw in twists upon twists!' The actors were uniformly dull, and no one stood out. The story line was well, just forget it, its not worth going into.'Memento' by the same director is far superior to this mess. This movie isn't even in the same league as that. Also, the movie was too long, I was praying for it to end several times but it just kept going. It was a relief when the movie finally ended. I can't stand movies that wear out their welcome, and this movie should have been cut to 90 minutes.I'll give it a 5 just because it was an intelligent movie, but that is about all it had going for it.",5,10,29,17 July 2010
Murder on the Orient Express," A Fantastic atmospheric classical style mystery - with great actors/actresses!
","Wow, I didn't see this coming! I had seen previews and since I'm a British mystery book enthusiast, I very much was interested in the movie. But my expectations were not very high, because of all the disappointing drek that Hollywood has been churning out in recent history. Hollywood seems to have been having a really rough time in trying to make good movies lately.So I was very surprised at just how good this movie turned out to be. It's filmed in a very classical style, and reminds me of older movies, when they knew how to make good movies. Great atmosphere of a luxury train in the 1930s, and the train interior scenes are done in a way that doesn't feel cramped at all, like you might think. It all feels very natural. The ensemble cast is excellent. My favorite characters and performances in the movie were Kenneth Branagh as the esteemed detective Hercule Poirot, Willem Dafoe as Professor Gerhard Hardman, and especially Michelle Pfeiffer as Caroline Hubbard.I don't know what it is about Michelle Pfeiffer, but I have taken a real liking to her as she has become an older actress. I used to not like her at all when she was 'young and hot', but now I think she is a really good actress and I'm excited to see her name in a film. Here, she is really superb playing a mature woman who still has a wild streak in her, and she almost steals the entire movie all by herself.But Kenneth Branagh also gives a sterling performance, and I was very impressed by his portrayal of the detective Poirot in the movie. He was pretty amazing in how authentic the character came across as, and had a hell of a presence in the movie, basically anchoring the whole movie around his performance.Willem Dafoe was solid, as usual, as a fine character actor. And he had a really good reveal type scene near the end of the film, I thought. That said, the acting from all the characters in the movie, both major and minor, was of a very high caliber overall.The film's mystery is based on the famous Agatha Christie novel, which I must confess I never read. So, the entire plot was a surprise to me, and I have to say it was a damn fine mystery! I now know why this book is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mystery novels, its quite fantastic! I didn't see the solution coming at all, and even though I have read numerous detective books and seen a ton of mystery TV shows, the climax even surprised me, which shows just how special this mystery really is -- definitely written by a master.My only real criticism is that the film is shot in 65mm, which gives the film kind of a fantasy, story-book like look to the whole film. A lot of the landscape shots especially looked fake and like CGI because of this. I prefer the more realistic look that you get from normal 35mm film. A minor complaint is the film feels a bit rushed to me, and maybe should have been half an hour longer. This is a very unusual complaint coming from me, because I don't like and often will criticize the too long running times of many movies these days. But this movie felt like it could have used another half hour to expand upon, and not feel so rushed.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys traditional style mysteries, it really is a must-see!",8,9,25,13 November 2017
Centurion," Routine but enjoyable movie focused on Roman legion
","I thought this was a good action and adventure movie loosely based on ancient history about a legion of Roman soldiers manning a remote outpost who end up being overrun by their doggedly determined enemies the Picts.The movie moves along at a quick pace, with good if bloody action pieces at various intervals. One thing that was annoying is the overuse of CGI blood effects which made the sword fighting action look a bit corny with blood spurts being too cartoon like and happening too often to take seriously.The best aspect is the agreeable acting of the small group of men who must band together to try and overcome steep odds in their quest. Competent acting performances by the character actors give the movie some unexpected dramatic heft and substance. The ending of the movie ends up being a stereotypical disappointment, but on the whole a diverting enough experience to get there.",7,1,3,25 May 2011
The Conjuring," Not good
","I had read positive reviews about this movie, with some saying it was really scary and others giving it high praise. So it was with some anticipation as I sat down in the theater to watch this,since I am a horror movie aficionado, thinking I was in for a treat. Well, instead of a treat, the trick was on me. This movie was not scary in the least, and it was not even a good horror movie. I found myself laughing at some of the scenes, instead of feeling scared or spooked. The only thing I felt was spooky was the weird doll, which was well done and freaky looking. Besides that, this is a bog standard ghost horror movie that many movie watchers have seen a thousand times before. It brings nothing new to the table. Not sure where all the glowing reviews are coming from.",4,7,14,9 September 2013
Prometheus," What a letdown
","Prometheus is a highly anticipated movie, and many were looking forward to it, expecting a sumptuous steak, and instead it turns out to be no better than a common fast food hamburger.The plot starts out slow, and makes little sense, to the point of it being confusing understanding what is going on. This feeling is pervasive throughout the movie, with an incoherent plot, and it never makes much sense. When the real 'villain' pulling the strings is revealed, its almost laughable. Some no-name actors in the major roles don't help matters. Michael Fassbender is the exception, and tries his best, but even he seems to make little impression as an enigmatic android. He is given too little to work with, it wasn't his fault.The only really good element in the movie is the scenery, which is visionary and occasionally awe-inspiring, with desolate and rocky vistas on an unknown planet, its quite well done. The advanced futuristic tech is pretty interesting as well, with cool gadgets and neat ideas about how the technology might be in the future.Everything else besides this is disappointing, and its a shame they couldn't have made the story and characters live up to the mysterious far away planet vistas and the distant lonely space atmosphere they created.",5,4,8,8 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," High expectations not met, but worth seeing
","I bought into the hype surrounding this, and unfortunately it was not as good as I had hoped.The mutants were mostly boring, with the exceptions of Magneto, Professor X and Mystique. I thought some of the mutants powers were really lame too, like the mutant who had wings or the guy who could scream sound waves.The makeup was very bad on a couple of the mutants, with the Beast looking like a big blue fur ball with a goofy face that made me chuckle. Azazel was funny looking too, with bright red makeup and looking like he bought a Devil costume for Halloween.On the bright side, the performance of Michael Fassbender as Magneto was a highlight, and made the film worthwhile to see with cool powers and action scenes featuring him. He was definitely the most entertaining thing about the film. Professor X was good, but a little bit sanctimonious and preachingly sitting on a high pedestal to take seriously. I also liked Mystique, and felt the actress gave a good performance as the character, which was more interesting than many of the other mutants.The Wolverine cameo was a brief throwaway scene and they shouldn't even have bothered. Overall, the special effects were well done and what you might expect from an expensive Hollywood film, so no complaints on that score. The ending is exciting and sets up a sequel nicely, with Magneto leading the evil mutants.The movie has a goofy charm about it which makes it easier to overlook its drawbacks and I would recommend it to comic book movie fans.",6,1,5,5 June 2011
The Wolverine," Great entertainment, made for adults
","This is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This movie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight scenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies lately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine. I thought it was unexpectedly good, with Jackman doing a superb job in the lead role, as a tortured hero, who seems as if he no longer wants to go on living his near immortal existence because of deep regrets and guilt he is feeling about things that happened in the past.But it is not all doom and gloom, there are indeed fight scenes, and they are what you would expect of a summer blockbuster type movie. The last fight scene involving a giant robot-like Samurai is especially spectacular. Just don't expect the fight scenes to be the main focus of the movie, this is more about the Wolverine and his inner struggles of conscience. I liked it very much.",8,71,146,30 July 2013
Mother!," A 2 hour ordeal - movie torture
","First off, this felt (at least) 3 hours long, but was only 2 hours, to my great surprise. Ugh. Where do I begin. My friend dragged me to see this, I warned him ahead of time that it was directed by an artsy type director. We had seen another truly awful movie by this same director many years ago - Pi. This movie is one of the worst movies of the decade, if not the century. It's painful to see how self-important, pretentious and eager this movie tries to be, as if its some sort of artistic film. It fails totally.Jennifer Lawrence - what was she thinking? Worst career move in recent history. I just hope this movie doesn't end her career - yes, it is THAT bad. I really liked her acting and performance in the Hunger Games movies, but here, even her star power can't even barely make a dent in the utter awfulness of this film. I can only say that watching this movie was an ordeal, and I'm shocked more people didn't leave the screening earlier, but like me and my friend, most stayed and watched it all the way until the bitter end, waiting for a miracle that it might get better - it never did.",1,23,36,18 September 2017
The Purge," Really good thriller
","This was surprisingly good, and delivered in the suspense and thrills dept. with a wallop. The direction was no nonsense and lean, with no unnecessary padding or scenes. I think this didn't get as much attention as it should have, and will be a good movie to rent if you didn't see it in the theater. Ethan Hawke is good as the devoted father, who just wants to save his family, no matter what the cost. But all the actors give good performances, from the kids to the strange neighbors, to the black guy who is on the run and trying to escape with his life.There are some nice and suspenseful scenes with a building tension, and no cheap scares. I really liked the ending as well, with its neat twist. This is much more of a thriller than a horror, but does have some fairly graphic scenes of violence, so that is something to keep in mind. Anyone who likes thrillers with an intriguing science fiction-like premise shouldn't miss 'The Purge'.",8,1,5,15 July 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Wow, an amazing sequel that outdoes the first one in all respects!
","I must say that Catching Fire blew me away in how good it was, I didn't expect this. I was not impressed with the first movie - The Hunger Games - but this sequel raises the bar significantly and its stunning at just how entertaining the film is, and very surprising what they accomplished here. Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal in the lead role, showing a great range of emotions and intensity, it was one of the best performances by a lead that I have seen in a long time. But this movie is full of great acting, with all the parts being played to a high level, and it goes along with a suspenseful and exciting plot, which draws you into the movie with ease and skill. I know I sound like I'm gushing, but it's just that kind of a movie, where you leave the theater excited and with an afterglow of having seen a first rate piece of film making. I can't wait to see the third movie, the anticipation is already building to see what happens next. I applaud all the actors and directors and special effects people, they really excelled and made quite a movie!",8,2,21,24 November 2013
300," As stupid as it gets
","A really freakishly bad movie. The scenes were so ridiculous and boneheaded with all the nuance of a World Wrestling Federation story line. I can't believe this is the same guy who made the great horror remake 'Dawn of the Dead'. It almost makes me think he was given credit wrongly and someone else did that film.I felt embarrassed for anyone who was in this movie as it went on. The actors probably were laughing at all the stupid scenes they had to do. Heck, I felt embarrassed I was watching it! It brought to mind the image of a 12 year old boy sitting in junior high school class and day dreaming about a movie in his head and thinking to himself this would be so cool and everyone would love my movie! That is about the maturity level this movie aspires to and delivers.",1,4,8,20 July 2011
Fast Five," Better than expected
","I went into this movie not having seen any of the previous ones, and was pleasantly surprised to find a fairly good action movie. Lots of beautiful exotic sports cars and video game-like stunts using them to make crazy jumps and turns and chases. The shootout scenes weren't half bad either, with people realistically going down after being shot once instead of the usual routine in most action movies where everyone seems to be wearing heavy duty bullet-repellent suits on and it appears to be impossible to hit anyone despite hails of bullets in the air. Though some scenes admittedly do get rather ridiculous, with speeding cars skidding around a heavily populated city and yet everyone seems to get out of the way in time, but oh well. You have to give a certain amount of leeway to a movie like this to enjoy it. Vin Diesel and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson both turn in their standard tough guy performances, and I don't think fans of either one of them would be disappointed.For a pre-summer season action movie, it could have been a lot worse, and is a fun and light diversion.",7,0,1,17 May 2011
The Cabin in the Woods," Pretty fun and imaginative horror
","I won't spoil anything, because this movie should be seen with little information. I didn't even watch the trailer before seeing it. It is an imaginative take on the typical horror movie, with some surprises. Overall, I would say it's a little over-rated, and not quite all that, but to horror aficionados it will be very entertaining. At least it is something different and creative than ordinary horror fare, even if the ending is flat and lackluster in my opinion.It has great special effects for sure and the actors are serviceable, if somewhat nondescript and uncharismatic. It is a movie filmed with some style, but if you don't go with it or find that quirky style appealing, you may dislike this. I enjoyed it in any event, with the caveat I'm an enthusiastic horror fan.",7,4,12,27 April 2012
Braveheart," Oh my god, howlingly bad
","I just watched this, although it took me days to finally finish watching this 3 hour bloated boring movie in its entirety. I would watch one hour and then had to take breaks because of how bad it was, but I was determined to watch it to the end. Its the kind of movie that is so bad, so amazingly goofy, that its funny.I don't know anything about the history of Scotland and don't care, my review is on the movie itself. Mel Gibson, I liked him in the Mad Max movies. But in this movie, he is nutty and just totally ridiculous. He wears weird blue makeup in a battle scene, and then after killing all the enemy he stands there covered in blood and gore, and looks at his men, and screams 'YAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGGGGG' It is so ridiculous and laughable! Then it gets worse! At the end of the movie he is brought in on a freakin' CROSS, like he is Jesus Christ! I have to say I lost it at that point. What in the world were they thinking? I was blown away by how loony and silly this scene was, with Mel looking at all the people throwing things at him, and he is pretending to be holy like a Jesus or somethin'. When he screamed 'FREEDOM' at the end, I wanted to scream too - in agony! I can't believe this movie won awards, except for if it had won a raspberry award for worst picture!",1,42,96,11 January 2010
