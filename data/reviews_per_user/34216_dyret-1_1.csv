Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Starwars is still a Trilogy!
","I am not one of those Die Hard fans of the original ones (Only saw them some 20-30times), but after seeing this movie I now claim that Star-Wars is a Trilogy, and always will be. I saw this in a Norwegian Cinema and the first disappointment came as early as when I noticed that they'd translated the text disappearing into space... Poorly!! This is a clear indicator that this movie is meant kids, not grown ups who speak English, why else would they bother to translate this, taken into consideration that English is thought in Norwegian schools since 1st grade. In my opinion child actors (with very few exceptions, 'Annie' not being one of them) are best at acting for kids. I am rather embarrassed at most of the acting in this movie, even though I have to give them some credit, this is more like a cartoon, and it couldn't have been easy standing before a blue-screen while imagining being in space. George Lucas probably thought he could camouflage it with some special effects?The clear gap in Technology is too obvious, R2D2 can project amazing 3d (an ability he looses some 30yrs. later?). The ships from the original trilogy look like they are from another dimension. The ships in the original one were made in the 70's, but they had the look and feel as if they actually could work, and it gave the whole feel of 'Adventure'. I just don't get the same feel from what for me looks like a 'silver dildo' floating through space. It's almost as if they've made a poor attempt at attracting Star-Trek fans. And besides all these flaws in technology, what happened to Obi-Wan being trained by Yoda? In 'The empire strikes back' Obi-Wan says it TWICE- and still George Lucas forgot. How could this help us sort things out? If anything I am more confused!Not was this movie made for kids, but it through telling it as if a kid would tell it, it is a kids movie. This pretty harsh criticism, but bear with me :) Imagine a kid telling you about his day; 'First were on a ship, then that happened, then we were on this planet, then we left for that city, and we were in space, and we went to a city, and then we went pod-racing, and then, and then, and then.' For some it might be a bit difficult to notice, but George Lucas has cleverly left out all the adventure, all the fantasy, all the trivia. I never once wanted to 'be there' like I wanted in the original ones. This movie has no soul, no feel, no appeal. This is from the Star Wars universe, but it is not a prequel. Why didn't they hire some of the guys responsible for Knights of the old Republic (VG)? Or why not the ones who made Battlestar Galactica? Fire George Lucas, that might bring Star Wars back to its former glory!",2,0,1,19 May 2005
