Ford v Ferrari," Finally a (Real) Movie.
","First of all if you haven't seen the movie what are you doing in your life?
So I will this short, Christian Bale is one of the best actors today. He gave a wonderful performance in this film! And the relationship between him and Matt Damon is what makes this a masterpiece. Other thing is the racing shots and sounds of the cars was absolutely amazing. And by that I can say this is one of the best movies in this year.",8,2,3,30 November 2019

Bohemian Rhapsody," Best 2018 Movie with an amazing acting!
","Rami Malek killed it in this Movie,I think he deserves an Oscar for this movie.
The way they act the characters was so real and that is why I gave 'bohemian rhapsody' 9 Star rating.",8,5,7,19 December 2018
Avengers: Endgame," A Marvel Masterpiece. holy Moly what did I just watched!
","OMG Guys !
This was the best Directed, edited and everything in a marvel movie ever.
I love how they play with our emotions one moment you are sad and the next one you are laughing.
In addition, they gave every character the perfect screen time !
I Must say that everyone should see this MASTERPIECE On IMAX to see the beauty of it.",9,2,5,24 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Great! But not the best.
","I think that Toy Story 3 was a little bet better than this.
I don't know why I see that they are trying so hard to get an idea to make the film longer.
And the one thing that I hate in this movie was the villain , she and her Boys Had not scared me at all.
I think they knew the villain wasn't that good so they added old Jumpy scary things.
Anyway it was Better than Toy Story 1 and 2.",8,0,1,24 June 2019
The Fault in Our Stars," Wow ! I know I'm too late but wow.
","It's the best romantic Film I have ever seen , the relationship between Augustus and hazel is so beautiful.",9,1,2,16 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good...But not that good for a Tarantino Film
","This is a short Review : Beginning with the advantages which was the Oscar Acting From both DiCaprio and Brad Bitt. Second was of course the directing can't talk about directing because everybody knows Tarantino's Directing. But for the disadvantages it's of course that the movie don't have a story! I know he want us to see Hollywood in 60's and know about Sharon Tate murder but come on we wanted a good story, what was Margot Robbie doing along the film ? Just dancing in every song in it. All in all it was good and I love Tarantino Films.",7,1,1,22 August 2019
Aladdin," It's quite good !
","I really loved it specially the songs like A whole new world-Spechless , but the one thing that I didn't like was the actor of jafar was bad.",7,0,3,14 August 2019
The King," 8.5/10
","*This is a short Non-Spoiler Review*
I was shocked how the film was so good, I believe that this is the first Netflix movie to be that good. The performances from the cast was Nearly perfect and I see that the hero of the movie was the one who casted them. War shots were too good and they Remind me of Game of thrones war shots. All in all, this is a must see movie of 2019. Bravo Timoth√©e Chalamet!",8,72,121,1 November 2019
