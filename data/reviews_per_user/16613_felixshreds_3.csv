Catch Me If You Can," Inspiring.
","<ul><li>This review contains spoilers. - I've watched this movie several times. I remember seeing it the first time. Being astounded by the brilliance of DiCaprio's character and by the intelligent storytelling, I directly decided to write this review.</li></ul>Frank is a rebel. He thinks outside the box and therefore realizes the weakness of the system. With a morally questionable attitude towards authority and routine, he decides to live a dangerous and permanently altering life. The life of a genius, however a liar - an ambivalent personality whose actions can be evaluated and assessed controversially.The story is developed nicely. Starting with a funny exposition in which Frank's unusual, yet clever behavior is shown, Spielberg continues by illustrating the inciting incident to a rare career. A divorce! This is the aspect of this movie that is the most interesting one. Divorces have become such a regular thing. Why would such a daily happening event effect so greatly on an intelligent person? This circumstance can only be reasoned by the idiosyncrasies of Frank Abergnale's character. Although his brilliance and his rebellion let him appear as an emotionally cold, completely rational person, the cause of all his decisions lays in a very psychological and emotional event. Suddenly this movie seems to be rather a psychological study on an insurrectionist, than a regular crime story.This is the point where Hanks' character comes into play. This character implies antagonism, thus adds a whole amount of suspense to the story. Let me ignore all the often discussed coincidental scenes of confrontation in this film at that point. Hanks' occurrence adds a duality to the story. And at the end, somehow Hanks and DiCaprio become friends and partners. Despite the fact that they act against each other, there never is hatred or greed in their relationship. They just play their social roles as a rebel and as a detective. It's a socially required rivalry. This is also the reason for which they are able to peacefully work together at the end. The movie documents the genesis of a rare friendship, which was used to be avoided by the existence of social roles.I comprehend this movie as a sociological study, due to the fact that it shows extraordinary characters in typical social roles, as well as social dynamics that we all know.Visually this movie is well made. Well directed, well written, well acted - but cinematically there is no specialty that needs to be pointed out especially. The brilliance of this piece consists in the topic it deals with.Thanks for reading, watch this movie and relate yourself to the characters and it will inspire you!",8,1,2,6 October 2013
Drive," A suspenseful romantic thriller a la film Noir
","The movie 'Drive', starring Ryan Gosling in the leading role and written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, tells the story of a stunt show-driver, who earns himself some extra money by helping criminals to escape from their robberies. The main character is visibly loathed to keep on his criminal activity, but also requires the financial advantages of it. One day, he gets to know his female neighbor and decides to do his last job. But not before he the neighbor's fiancÃ© returns home after a long imprisonment... Nicolas Winding Refn did a terrific job directing 'Drive'. Asthetically, cinematically and effectively, he chose the best possible visual style and directed his actors. He did a truly amazing direction without exceptions. He manages to create a great harmony between the atmosphere of the visual aspects and the story's characteristics. The acting is conspicuously great. Ryan Gosling's minimalistic performance of the tough but deep stuntman, who is fed up with criminality and in a kind of experimental love with the girl next door, blew my mind, so did Carrey Mulligan's sensitive interpretation of the young lovely mother.The car chases are the best ones in movie history. The movie's problem is that it failingly tries to convey a general criticism of materialism, which is transported, but not at all convincing and also absolutely displaced in the story. Being indeed stylistically well and authentically made, it does not meet its requirements of successfully criticizing materialistic values.",10,1,7,10 June 2013
The Game," an incredibly well made, thoughtful and intelligent thriller
","Warning: this review may includes contents that foreshadow contents of the movie (spoiler alert!)! Michael Douglas plays an investment-banker, who is soon to become an immoral, reckless and lonely man. In order to avoid this development, his brother makes him a present that remains to be the central theme of the movie. 1. Plot: Numerous unexpectable and intelligent twists, especially at the end, in combination with a lack of information that is well placed throughout almost the entire movie create a suspenseful and exciting atmosphere. This plot, in which I see the excellence in this movie, has all it needs: a philosophic topic that can be found in the raised question of whether we are capable of knowing whats real and whats not; the protagonist's great motivation and desire to comprehend his surroundings and to survive; and last but not least: the high amount of absolutely great twists that keep the unpredictability steady. 2. Acting: I personally was very impressed by Sean Penn's performance that in the end effect brilliantly conveyed his characters motivation in a very subtle way. Douglas delivered a very authentic performance as well, but is not to be especially mentioned in my eyes, even though I would be incapable of spontaneously criticizing his acting in this movie. Furthermore Armin Mueller-Stahl brilliantly portrayed Anson Bear, the co-founder of Bear-Grant Publishing, who is soon to be made redundant. 3. Direction: One just has to hear the name David Fincher and it is clear that this movie is beautifully shot, absolutely aesthetic and simply outstanding concerning the direction. Once more David Fincher's sense for symmetry, beauteous colors and timing made a movie nicer to watch (at this point: thank you, Sir!). My standpoint is that these are the things to mainly mention about this movie. There is neither an outstanding score, nor genius editing etc.. It is legit and solid, but not superb. On the other hand there is a great plot, along with a brilliant direction and nice performances that compensate these aspects and even make it one of the most intelligent and suspenseful movies I've seen so far. Conclusion: The Game is an incredibly well made, thoughtful and intelligent thriller.",10,2,4,24 December 2012
