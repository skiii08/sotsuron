United 93," well made
",I had some reservations about seeing this movie. Not sure why. Finally I realized that I needed to be reminded about 9-11. We have a tendency to forget. This movie was done in great taste and with respect. I am glad I went. I am glad that I was reminded once again what happened and left with a clearer understanding of what may have taken place on flight 93. I Left the theater with a mixture of sadness for what had happened and also a sense of pride for those it happened to and their families. This movie will stick with me for quite a while. I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that they have forgotten and want to remember. There was complete silence in the theater upon exiting. This movie is not for all but I think most should see it. It is good to remember and reflect on a very important part of recent history.,10,9,18,28 April 2006
