Sucker Punch," So awful, I don't know where to start...
","I'm being generous here with a three-star rating, mostly because I can see that the video-game violence and scantily-dressed teen girls (even though they're all played by 20-somethings) might have an appeal to a certain audience.First off, how on earth is this a PG-13 movie? Oh, that's right, you don't get a R these days unless there's some bare tits, or an actual disembowelment shown. Don't be fooled by the 'fantasy' violence claim - sure, it's not Saving Private Ryan realism, but the violence is still presented in a realistic manner (sidestepped with the 'but it's only a dream' shtick). There's also more than enough 'shake-your ass and tits for the camera, girls' action to disqualify this from any semblance of modesty - let's face it, this is blatant sexual exploitation and gratuitous sex, all presented with a veneer of clothing to make it past the MPAA.The CGI is passable - it's at the quality level of a good XBox 360 game. The fight scenes are ludicrous (not even really entertaining in an over-the-top way). The settings are ridiculous (even for a 'dream' sequence) - how's a 10-foot tall traditional samurai with a MINIGUN fit in? It doesn't, it's just there to look cool, which fails - it's just ridiculous. Dialogue - well, I guess, the best thing that can be said is there's little of it, so we only have to cringe occasionally when some clich√© movie quote is tossed out like it was from Moses on the Temple Mount.Finally, there's no plot. None at all. We're presented with an interesting premise at the opening, then it really goes nowhere. No character involvement either - each of the girls is a cardboard cutout, with the supporting cast as a bunch of stereotypical bad-guy (or bad-girl) roles filled by real actors who must have been either paid a huge amount to debase their skills in this thing (I can't call it a movie), or were simply bamboozled by the script.Don't see this. More importantly, don't let your teenage son or daughter see it; I'd classify this thing as more damaging to a teenager than watching a full blood-and-sex film like Shoot Em Up.In the end, this comes across as what a 13-year-old boy (raised on XBox) thinks is cool, what at 15-year-old boy who (who surfs internet porn) thinks is sexy, and what a 17-year-old Emo boy thinks is deep and meaningful. The sick thing? It's made by a 45-year-old 'man'.",3,1,6,30 April 2012
