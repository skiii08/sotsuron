The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A Lackluster Follow-up to a Promising Franchise
","If Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2012) was an archetypal example of how to one-up an original movie and create an enthralling and captivating movie franchise, Mockingjay Part 1 is the all too typical way of crushing that excitement. What was shaping up to be a memorable franchise that would become logged in the public discourse and be mentioned in the same breath as Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia was unceremoniously extinguished by a completely lackluster third installment. Disappointing in many regards, it lacked so many of the things that made the first and, especially, the second movie so fun to watch. Whatever momentum the series had before this was lost in something that was simply a mediocre sequel.What made Catching Fire so good? It was the intense and unique action in The Games that never let you relax for a moment. It was the reliance on heavy hitting talent in Jennifer Lawrence, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Donald Sutherland. It was the beautiful imagery of The Capital and the contrast to the bleak existence in the cities. It was the sense of fulfillment in seeing an oppressed society rise up against its oppressors. Most of this was lost, or at least made bland and boring in Mockingjay Part 1.One of the most unfortunate critiques in this movie compared to the last is the fact that it is entirely generic and forgettable. It feels like you could plug this movie into almost any science fiction fight-against-the-man type of film series. Was this The Hunger Games or was it Maze Runner? Or was it Divergence? One could imagine a nearly identical course of events in almost any anti-establishment narrative. Clearly, the story couldn't just repeat the Hunger Games for a third time or it would become stale, but these are not the only things that make the world unique. You have the exorbitant extravagance of The Capital Citizens. There is the uniqueness of each of the 12 districts and how they interact with each other. There are the Gamemakers and their sleuthy, creative killing methods. All these things and more were forgotten in place of a plug-and-play rebel alliance story.Another disappointment was the onscreen chemistry of the actors and the lack of use of some amazing actors. In Catching Fire, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and Finnick (Sam Claflin) play a strong supporting role to Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence), who puts in a masterful performance in being a broken, scared girl to growing up and accepting the challenge and becoming the heroic figure. Plutarch (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) is an enigmatic wildcard with a sly smile who keeps us guessing. In Mockingjay Part 1, Lawrence gets very little time to shine. The intense action scenes which she does so well are few and far between. Hutcherson is rarely in scenes and when he is, his acting abilities are subdued. Hoffman is made to take a backseat as only a mere pawn in the grand scheme of things. And unfortunately, Julianne Moore (who plays President Alma Coin) put in a less than inspiring performance as the aspiring leader of a rebellious uprising.Catching Fire gave us a sense of purpose as audience members, when we could cheer for the gradual uprising in the districts mirrored by Katniss' success in The Games, both her physical defeats of Capital sympathizing stand-ins from the first districts, and her emotional grapplings with killing and its repercussions. Once we are introduced to District 13 and the underground rebellious movement, headed by Alma Coin, it seems to lose its luster. This is no longer Poncho Villa versus the oligarchical dictatorship, it's the Allies versus the Axis, a feeling of an even playing field. Gone is that feeling of an underdog that's building up to something special, led by an unexpected hero. Instead we jump-cut to the point where the Districts have an established military system and a next-in-line dictator who doesn't seem to care much about her people. It's a fight without a face and heel, just machine against machine.There is something that feels artificial about Katniss and her Mockingjay persona in this film. The film itself is almost a meta-critique of this. The Mockingjay is quite literally an artificial construct used by District 13 to inspire the rebellion. Katniss, however, wants to be genuine and passionate in the propaganda videos and has the opportunity to make grand speeches in the face of real crisis. However, even these moments of supposed truthfulness feel like a reenactment. This whole idea of having film cameras follow around Katniss, and especially the propaganda films they make, feel like something from a cheesy satirical comedy. It recalls images of 'I'm doing my part!' from Starship Troopers (1997). Starships Troopers has the benefit of not taking itself too seriously, being purposefully lighthearted in contrast to the dark reality. Mockingjay Part 1, on the other hand, attempts to be only darkness, a bleak reality of war. Scenes with that comedic spin feels forced and out of place rather than tension breaking.In the end, what we all wanted this movie to be, and what the studio needed it to be, was a setup to the inevitable conflict and resolution in the final movie that we all already knew was coming. The audience should be on the edge of their seat in anticipation for the finale after watching this film. However, that feeling is not something I expect many people would be left with. Having split the final book into two parts, the film is left with many voids of space compared to the first two films which were so jam packed with action and plot progression it almost felt rushed. It is a slog to get through this, and the final film can only hope to compensate in some ways.Writing this review a few years after the movie was released, and looking back on it in retrospect, it seems unfortunate that the series has exited public consciousness for the most part. You never see Hunger Games themed toys at the store, and people don't usually bring it up in conversation. This pales in comparison to the extreme hype when the first film was released. Perhaps this is the natural progression of things, that a series should run its course and have its day in the sun. Not everything can last like certain stories. It is just disappointing to know that something that started with so much promise will end with a whimper and not a bang.",5,2,2,13 May 2020
The Hunger Games," Visuals Out of Texts: The Beauty of Adapting
","If you wanted to watch a faithful adaptation of a novel for the big screen, then The Hunger Games is a perfect starting point. The film is able to capture not only the main story and important details, but the feeling and aesthetics described in the book. The dialogue, characters and scenes feel like a translation into visual media, without any need for re-imagining or reworking. The novel is what captivated audiences and launched the story to its lofty heights, and so an accurate representation was necessary. Unlike many films in the past in which directors can take many liberties with relatively less popular novels, The Hunger games follows on with the trend of young adult literature, think Harry Potter and Twilight, which is so universally well-known that nothing can be changed without provoking the ire of wanting young audiences. In this regard, The Hunger Games has done its job and given the people what they demanded.One interesting, but not entirely novel, problem faced with a film adaptation was the first person narrative in the novel. Katniss is the narrator and main character, and much of the exposition happens in her head. The novel is relatively sparse on dialogue for a large chunk of it, but we have Katniss to help guide us through the various newly introduced details. In the film, however, we don't have her inner monologue. Instead, the film opts to have Caeser Flickerman and his co-host act as elucidators during the Games, and the intermittent flash-backs inform us of the backstory for Katniss and Peeta. The film is not over-the-top with its backstory, giving us only the bare minimum of what we need to fill in the blanks. This is okay, because they know that many of those who come to see the movie have already read the book and know the details. However, any new fan coming into the series starting with the films might have their work cut out for them to understand the finer points.The visual representations are also stunning. On one side we have the districts, garbed in 1940s style clothing as a symbol of living under totalitarianism mimicked from our own often sad world. They are lacking of all luxuries and indulgences. We get a short glimpse of this austere world in Katniss's household and the depressing village she lives in. Then suddenly we are shocked by the image of Effie Trinket, a fluorescent china doll in a gray world. It is like coming out of a dark room and seeing the sun for the first time, it blinds you. The contrast between the people in the Capital and those in the districts could not be any clearer. It is hedonism versus survival. The pastries and parties and petticoats and an insult to the lifetime of struggle faced by the peasantry, and that comes across astutely in the film.Despite the nearly two and a half hour length, the film still feels as though it were somewhat rushed. The important setup is skimmed over in favor of getting to the Games quicker, but still arrives there at the one hour mark. This is sensible from a marketing perspective, you want the action to take up the majority of the film. It is somewhat of an unsolvable problem. The film must necessarily be the entire plot from start to finish and not broken up into two parts (leave that to the final installment after your audience is already emotionally invested). Yet it still needs to summarize a relatively complex plot with an entirely new world in a short amount of time and satisfyingly display all of the important action. There isn't enough time to flesh out certain things, like Katniss's love triangle, or Haymitch's true character, but the film does as best as it can. In this regard, it gets a passing grade.Another limiting factor is the desire to make the film available to all audiences, that is to say, to tone down the violence and allow for a PG rating. This story is another unfortunate casualty of the MPAA and the need for as wide a reach as possible. What is this story about, really? It's about teens tearing each other apart in bloody gladiatorial conquest. It is violence to the umpteenth degree. If ever there was a film that deserves as much blood and gore as possible, this is it. This is not the fault of the filmmakers, they did their due diligence in trying to show as much as possible. This is more of a 'disgruntled critic shaking his fist as the system' type of situation.The film is not perfect by any stretch, as it comes from a rather imperfect book. The novel did not reach its zenith on the back of Collins' stupendous ability to create lifelike characters. Nor was it on her convincing ability to make a romantic subplot. These faltering details are present in the film too, though somewhat compensated by the acting abilities of Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, among others. The story is amazing because of its premise. It is a collectathon mixed with a battle royale with an intriguing political subplot of fascism and cultural revolution. It feels like something that can inspire us and give us refuge from our own world. Despite its fantastical elements, it feels like something you could place yourself into, and it almost makes you wish you could be there to see if you could survive.Where this film succeeds is in its ability to take an already successful and interesting novel and put it into visual terms that everyone can enjoy. Where it fails is paradoxically in the same way, where it was too true to the book when it could have improved or reinterpreted. Dialogue that works in text doesn't always feel lifelike coming from a real person, nor does an exciting action sequence look as exciting on screen. That being said, The Hunger Games should not be overlooked in the ever-growing genre of teen-fantasy novel adaptations. It is not a masterpiece or a hidden gem, but it is fun and worthwhile. Not everyone can be Peter Jackson and create something as monumental and consistently lauded as The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but we can hope not to go too far and become The Hobbit. Settling for a solid middle grounds of Harry Potter is a pretty good place to be.",7,0,0,30 April 2020
Moana," A Classic, Without the Substance
","Moana is exactly the type of film you get when you want a movie with an acceptable amount of entertainment for adults and children, a cookie-cutter plot that could be subbed in to any time period and culture, a minimum of challenge and character development, and catchy tunes that people will get stuck in their heads. It is the simulacrum of Disney's hundred year plan, to develop and distribute the easiest and shallowest media to the greatest masses of consumers. If you simply wanted a victory lap of the collected anthology of Disney princess odysseys, this is a perfect film. If you wanted anything new that you hadn't seen before, consider a different film.I should start with the plot, or lack-thereof. This film has every hallmark of the young adult adventure down pat. A sense of disconnect between the hero and their community. A magical item. A cheesy sidekick who serves solely for comedic relief and adds nothing to the plot. The death of a loved one. Being 'the chosen one'. And finally, a journey into the unknown to save their community/country/the world. You will find all the classic tropes in Moana. It is the very face of predictability. In some ways, you really can't go wrong with a classic arc like that, but after seeing it so many times, you crave for more. You want something different that you didn't expect. Disney will throw in the occasional mild twist or turn, but nothing that's going to make you think for more than 5 seconds, and certainly nothing that's going to confuse or alienate any young, timid minds.It felt like there were several missed opportunities here. We get the majority of the second act hyping up this idea of mythical creatures, monsters and super powers. Maui is a demigod with a magical hook and the power to give humans the very lifeblood of existence. I was dying to see what awaited in the realm of the monsters. And then as soon as it began, it was over. We got all of ten minutes and one song in the underworld before it was over. I was craving for more. The most intriguing point of the whole movie and they glossed over it in an instant. We got to see, in total, three monsters, including a throw in of the 'there's always a bigger fish' trope. The other missed opportunity was the adorable (so I thought) sidekick of Moana, Pua the Pig. The cute little white pig got only a few minutes of screen time before being shunned by Moana as she set off on her adventure. I was waiting for him to pop out of the underside of her boat, but alas, we didn't see him until the closing moments of the movie. So much for being a loyal supporter. You get left behind, and Hei-hei the idiot chicken gets the come instead. That being said, Hei-hei did give me the biggest laughs of the film.Despite all the criticism, there are some important parts that make the film enjoyable and at least worth one watch. Disney once again knocks it out of the park with their music. What can really be said that hasn't already about Disney musicals? They are the gold standard. They manage to tell a story while at the same time being catchy and fun. There is always at least one song in every Disney movie that you have to download and listen to on repeat for a week after you hear it. It has a set up piece, although perhaps a bit blunt and obvious, with Where You Are. A comedic song with You're Welcome, that will leave you saying 'I didn't know The Rock could sing...' And of course, the heavy hitter, How Far I'll Go, that I can safely admit was stuck in my head for a long time.The attention to detail is also something rarely missed among these classic animated features. The richness in the presentation of Polynesian culture is certainly something to be admired, and it is always nice to see a film that explores a seldom seen corner of the world. The animation is always beautiful and well done. The colors throughout the film are warm and subtle when they need to be, aquatic and fresh without being over the top or overpowering. The little easter eggs and subtle graphical details are always a special charm when watching a Disney film.Moana is exactly what it needs to be. Not something that is going to challenge or polarize anyone, but a fun, light-hearted adventure that will keep everyone, young and old, engaged for 100 minutes. And certainly, it can be said that not every film needs to be evocative in order to be good. Where Moana lacks is in character development and a compelling plot. You never grip the arm of your chair and wonder if they will really make it in time. The climax and resolution are known from the moment you see the characters formulating the plot in the 10 minute mark. Everything will be fine. Truly, it is fine. Just relax and take in the summer breeze and the light spray of misty salt water as the waves roll by.",5,0,0,14 January 2020
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Coloring the Mind, Exhilarating the Soul
","Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse didn't need to be this good. In 2018, superhero movies, especially Marvel movies, have a reputation which precedes them. People know what to expect when they walk into a superhero movie, and with little or no marketing involved, even a mediocre origin story can rake in a billion at the box office. Instead of delivering us some generic filler movie in between Avengers flicks, Into the Spider-Verse sends us on an exhilarating joy-ride into jaw-dropping visuals and story. This film is more than a film, it is a roller-coaster ride for all the senses; it genuinely left me feeling breathless and exhausted, in a good way.From the very first moment of the film until the very last moment, the film is a visual masterpiece. I am not even saying the beginning and end of the narrative portion of the film, but even the opening title screen and end credits. Not a single inch of this canvas was left untouched. It is a Hieronymus Bosch painting in the form of a film. The effort that went in to creating a compelling and interesting world is mind-boggling. It almost seems impossible that any team of people could produce something so fabulous.It reminds me of Princess Mononoke (1997) for its attention to detail, in which Hayao Miyazaki is said to have personally gone through each frame to perfect the backgrounds and make it lifelike. Take Time's Square, which we only see in the briefest of flashes. They had every right to phone it in on the details as the city hurtles past too quickly to be really taken in, but instead they jammed each frame full with colorful imagery, jokes and references. The close attention to detail makes it so fun to watch at every moment. Usually I am one to stay at least for part of the credits scene, but in this film it's not even difficult because through to the rolling of the cast credits, it still maintains the engrossing colors and imagery.The most obvious visual work going on in the film is the comic book nature. If we have a spectrum with Hulk (2003) at one end, representing the overuse of comic-book style to create campiness, Spider-Verse is on the polar opposite side, using the comic-book features so well that it is a work of art in itself. It is so tastefully done and compliments the story so perfectly that it feels like so much more than just a film. It is all visual mediums condensed into two hours. We get insights into characters thoughts through dialogue bubbles, we get brief and entertaining backstories as the flipping pages of a comic, the villains are made to be so much more cartoonishly villainous, and so much more.We are given such an amazing variety of interesting characters. Miles is a healthy mix of believably awkward, funny, charming and shy. He is one of the most realistic teenagers in film and somehow his situation, as unbelievable as it is, feels right. Peter Parker is a balance of heroic crime-fighter and derelict bum. He has flashes of brilliance as a mentor to Miles, but he has been through extraordinary trauma, and we see that at the proper moments to make him down to earth. Aunt May is usually just a helpless old-lady, but now she's a badass. Even Kingpin has an emotional arc that makes him a sympathetic villain, but we can still hate him as the antagonist. All of the other Spiders and villains only compliment each other and never go over the top. Peni, Noir and Spider-ham could have been nothing more than hilarious comic-relief, and they did that exceptionally, but they were used sparingly enough to not overpower the mood of the story or get in the way of the action. In fact they added to it and gave this movie a unique twist that other superhero movies don't have.I could just go on and on about all the amazing work done in this film. The sound design and song choices are spectacular. The plot is interesting and unique. The dialogue is so on point with its wittiness and intrigue. And oh my god, the visuals. I know I talked about this already, but good lord it is just beautiful. It's cyberpunk mixed with Dadaism, mixed with a kaleidoscopic, on acid, thrown into a blender and then molded by Michelangelo into a statue of the gods of Olympus. This movie attacks you from every side all at once and is relentless in its wonder. I could just go on and on about it, but it must be seen to be believed.Sometimes it can almost be difficult to critically review a film when it is so good and it has such an emotional resonance with you. This is how it felt with me during this movie. I don't want to just write about this movie, I want to experience it again and again. It has transcended my normal viewing pleasures and gripped me so wholly that it almost seems personally and purposefully constructed. Sometimes you just need to take a step back from something you love and take a breath. You can get lost in it if you look too long. This is so much more than a film. It is a monument to art and cinema. This is not just superheroes, this is sensory heroin.",10,1,2,22 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Lacking some of Pixar's usual magic
","Toy Story 4 is certainly a fourth installment of a franchise. Whether you believe this to be a good thing or a bad thing is up to your opinion of rehashed ideas and the merit of original ideas. While a fun watch, this film lacked a lot of the magic and world building, character development and interesting side characters that we are so used to in Toy Story films.The world we are put into in this Toy Story film is unfortunately shallow. Where in previous films we saw a wealth of interesting locations that have their own magic in each of them, the scope of this film is far more narrow. We are introduced to the carnival quickly and that is our home for 75 minutes or this film. It felt like the grand aspirations of an interesting world were not realized at all. I kept waiting for the next act, the next stop in the road trip, but it never arrived. We are also not given nearly enough of some of our favorite characters, in favor of drab tired side characters who lack much purpose. Potato Head, Rex, Slinky and Hamm have little more than a cursory mention, and Buzz is left with little to do besides act dumb and provide a small bit of comedic relief.And where was the tension? The fear? The subtle darkness that made the first few films so wide reaching in its entertainment. There was no Sid, no incinerator. Never was I afraid for these characters. It was too easy for them the whole time. I was never on the edge of my seat and wondering what might happen next.The stars of this movie were the small toys who were unique and colorful. The Canadian Daredevil, our high-five craving soldiers and the psychopathic horse were the stars of this movie and got the biggest laughs. They are a testament to Pixar's ability to have fun in the peripherals without overshadowing the main cast.And what more can be said about the animation that everyone hasn't said about Pixar a million times before? The effects were superb. It felt so real and lifelike and yet cartoonishly fun. The ability to make a fork who is sympathizable and relatable cannot be overstated. It's really the little details, the reflection of light off the water, the way a book falls off the shelf, or a lightbulb explodes when crashed into. These are where the magic happens.Was this movie fun? Yes of course. Was it the weakest of the franchise? Also yes. It didn't hit all the notes we have become accustomed to in Pixar films. Bring your kids, they will love it. And see it if you're a Pixar and Disney nerd, but I won't be putting this one on my shelf for my future children to watch as they grow up.",6,4,9,2 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A Dive into Cinematic Pseudo-History
","Tarantino is a master of his craft. That probably goes without saying at this point. We have seen it 8 times before and we have seen it for a ninth time now. I think whether you enjoyed the plot of any of the films is one thing, but to not see the cinematic artistry would be a sad oversight. Each scene and action and piece of dialogue is crafted in a meticulous and careful manner. It's really clear to see that Tarantino pays close attention to almost everything he does.What is the most impressive and interesting to me is the ability to set the period. From the cars to the building facades to the music to the clothing, everything feels like it should be in that time period. I have to be honest, I didn't live then and there. As with anything set in the past, there is the lens through which we gaze back and the nostalgia or criticism that clouds our judgement and makes us see it differently. We will never be able to perfectly recreate the times in the past, but we can try. And Tarantino has done an incredible job of it. It feels like 1969 in every way that it possibly could, and never strays from that.The sound design does an incredible job in this regard. It is often hard to tell the music from the sounds of the world. Is that song coming from the radio? Can the characters hear it or is it just me? It keeps you in the world and in the frame of mind of the characters. What did they hear in 1969?As for the actual story-line, I see from other reviews that there is disagreement around it. I understand that. Tarantino films can be polarizing. Sometimes there is too much dialogue and drawn out scenes. Sometimes people say that there is no point of a scene or that the story is too slow. I don't personally agree with that, but I accept and understand it. Sitting through a nearly 3 hour dialogue heavy movie is not for everyone, and that's okay. But to me the payoff is worth it.Knowing about Sharron Tate and Charles Manson's family is immensely helpful in having fun watching this film, as others have pointed out. It helps to create that dramatic tension and the build up, questioning what is going to happen. Tarantino is masterful at defying expectations, even in seemingly historical events. As we saw in his 2009 film Inglourious Basterds, we cannot take anything for granted and we cannot predict where Tarantino is going to take the plot. This makes it so exciting and thrilling to watch.We got what we expected out of Tarantino. Amazing dialogue with slow and drawn out soliloquies and conversations. Out of place dubbing that somehow works with the film. Gratuitous violence and blood that makes you laugh at the ridiculousness of it. Amazing acting from an amazing cast. For me, it's what I wanted and what I got. I wanted something more from The Hateful Eight (2015) and I got it in this film.",8,12,19,26 August 2019
Sausage Party," Raunchy Morons, And Nothing Else
","Sausage Party is based on a singular premise. 'It's a cartoon but they swear and do sexy things! Isn't that crazy?!' You needn't delve any deeper, because the writers evidently didn't either. And they also evidently have never seen any cartoon from the 90s or 2000s, or they would know that this style of comedy has been done to death by so many others that we, the audience, are no longer shocked or amused by the simple utterance of a swear word. If they were intending to pander explicitly to 13 year olds who have just learned the full array of swear words available to them, or to youths too high to formulate coherent thoughts (and let's be honest, these guys are no stranger to these audiences), then they've done their job, but at the cost of dumbing it down to the level of pure cringe inducing, over-the-top idiocy.This is quite disappointing coming from these writers. Rogen, Goldberg and Hill have certainly been around the block when it comes to stoner comedy. Superbad (2007), Pineapple Express (2008) and This Is The End (2013) were all goofy and ridiculous, but they were able to pull it back just enough to leave room for something else besides swearing and sexual innuendo. And that's important. You can make a movie where swearing and dick jokes are the only source of humor (and they did), but it's going to suck. I won't mince words here. This humor is puerile, idiotic and takes no skill or effort.This movie feels the need to constantly bash you over the head with it's comedy and it's metaphors. 'Do you get it? The sausages are penises! Do you get it?!' This is what it felt like watching the movie. It wasn't an enjoyable experience. It was a chore to wade through the overt and pointless exposition. Does every character need to be extremely horny, drunk or a babbling moron? The song at the very beginning could have been gold, but they chose to go the easiest route of literalness, with not even a hint of subtlety. It seemed like they weren't sure that people would get the religious metaphors, so they made sure to slap you in the face with it. There is no trust in the audience to get anything not spelled out in giant glowing letters. It's not only childish, it's insulting. I mean, the evil character, the one that is a huge jerk the whole movie, is literally a douche. Come on.Where do you go from here? It's seems like the writers and directors have exhausted the very limits of low-brow. You cannot get lower than this. The brow has sunk below the feet, under the earth, burned in the core of the earth. The same place where every copy of this movie should be, lest anyone suffer as I and many other have. The creators need to rewatch some Cartoon Network, brush up on how to do raunchy animated comedy, and then try again. Or better yet, stick to live action.",3,0,1,4 February 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," The Unexpected Flow of Elegance
","And I did get what I wanted from this film, even so. Having heard of this film and its continuous uncut structure, I remained skeptical, but left pleasantly surprised. Innaritu is able to deliver such a captivating story with twists and turns and progress despite it never feeling like there is a break in the action or a moment to catch your breath. This constant continuity kept me riveted and focused on what was happening, always curious to see that next 'scene'. In a way, this unbroken stream also creates an anxiety that allows the audience to really get inside Riggan's mind and feel what he is feeling. There is no time to pause and reflect before the next piece of dialogue or the next preview of the play, and so the audience is constantly holding their breath and waiting to see what will happen.The music score cannot be understated enough. Never did I expect that so much could be done with so little. The drums never stopped or faded entirely, only took a backseat during the dialogue and then thundered back in when needed. Their constant beating underscored the flow of time as it continuously marches forward. The way that it flows in and out of the actual scenes in the movie is beautifully done, as we always wonder where the drums are coming from. Are they around the corner on the street? Or are they all in my head? The classical music used to accentuate Riggan's hallucinations were wonderfully timed and jarring in their abruptness.This film won't be accessible for everyone. It is laced with ambiguity and caters to an artistic film audience. The meta-narrative of film critique and the industry may be lost of some people, but that doesn't stop the film from having a strong emotional impact on nearly everyone. With the end of the film, you will be left to wonder and speculate on your own, as any great film should make you do. Birdman captures something so uniquely human and yet so foreign and fantastical that everyone needs to see it first hand to experience this feeling.",8,1,2,13 August 2019
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," How to Do a Sequel Right
","There are two types of sequels. On one side you have The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The The Dark Knight (2008), and on the other you have Jaws II (1978) and Terminator Genysis (2015). Thankfully, Catching Fire falls squarely in the first category. After an exciting, if not entirely fleshed out, first film, Catching Fire delivers on all the promises of intense action, compelling and intriguing story-line and dynamic relationships between the characters that we were all waiting for. The Hunger Games is a series which, conceptually, deserves a well put-together film series. It is a fun and interesting concept which matures with the audience from a usual action-filled romp into a political thriller which can inspire almost anyone. We got what we needed thanks to this wonderful sequel.In the first film, one of the key issues was the pacing. Many things felled rushed, especially the backstory for the characters which was more or less only seen in brief flashbacks and allusions. The lead up to The Games felt like a formality that they needed to get through so they could show us the action. This is understandable. Everyone wants to see people fighting, not sappy emotional moments from characters we don't even know yet. In Catching Fire, we get a much more fluid arc which gives us the perfect amount of set-up before dropping us into the second installment of The Games, which now have considerably more meaning than just staying alive. In some ways, it is allowed to because now we are familiar with the premises and characters, but the film goes beyond that to an extra level.Take for example the character of President Snow. In the first film, we get only fleeting glimpses of this menacing character (which, I should add, does mimic the books). In the novel, this is okay because it's from Katniss' point of view. In the film, we need an antagonist, and Donald Sutherland puts on a menacing performance in this role. In Catching Fire, we get to see that in its full development. Snow is at the same time fatherly and forbidding, gentle but powerful. He has that same appeal as Emperor Palpatine or Xerxes, ones who have no accountability and all the power and thus are beholden to no law or morality but their own. This comes through perfectly thanks to the phenomenal acting and fitting script.At the end of the day though, we get out of the house and go to the theater for a movie like this because we want to see action. It's not shameful to want to see a bit of blood and battling every now and then. Well, let's just say we are not left disappointed. The Games have taken on a whole new life in this installment, and it feels that way. In the first film, The Games are nearly quaint. It is just a simple scenario for the combatants to do what they will, free mostly from egregious deus ex situations. Primitive and effective. In the sequel, it doesn't just seem like person against person, but instead the heroes versus the machine. It is the spark of the rebellion even before it is fully revealed to us. There are enough tricks and surprises of The Games to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time, wondering how our protagonists will get out of this one.Predictability is something that a film can suffer or thrive on. Have too much and your audience becomes bored, but too little and you risk raising the brow too high and going over too many heads. Catching Fire seems to find that perfect balance. I found myself often saying 'Ah, I know what's going to happen here.' and nearly immediately having it happen. I am not saying that as if I have some clairvoyant ability. What this film does it set the scenes up so tightly that you are rewarded for making guesses and allowed to feel like you've won by seeing the action in advance. It is not a cheap tactic either. They hit the mark here by giving you enough to work with but still leaving room for you to be excited and cheer when Katniss does the right thing. At the end, we are given enough of a cliffhanger leave us wanting more from the next sequel.Catching Fire is what sequels should strive to be. It didn't fall into any of the traps of a well-known series with a good original. It took what made the books and the original great and built on them. It helps that the actors seem to feel natural in their roles and with each other, likely the product of much more time working together. A perfect mix of action, thrills, mystery and socio-political drama, Catching Fire is simply altogether a great film. With this trend in the series, I am excited to see what Mockingjay has in store for me.",9,3,3,5 May 2020
Sin City," Know Thyself, and Stay True
","One important aspect of any media that keeps coming up for me as of late, and appears to be somewhat overlooked, is the ability for a film, TV show or book to know itself. That is to say, they should understand the type of media they are trying to produce and stay faithful to that, not get bogged down in unnecessary cliche and exposition, and use every aesthetic and storytelling tool to realize the premise they started with. The ability to stay true to oneself is up there with dialogue and visuals in terms of its importance in creating a believable and impactful film. There's a reason that everyone from early morning children's cartoons to Lady Gaga tells you to just be yourself. One film that does this exceptionally well is Sin City.In one respect, Sin City starts with some advantages in this way. To begin with, it is an adaptation of an exceptional graphic novel. The film needed only to stay faithful to the original and it was bound to be something special, and that is exactly what they did, keeping the stunningly contrasting aesthetics and largely including the dialogue. Graphic novels have had a great ability to keep this authenticity. They can take the neo-noir visuals and translate them well onto the big screen in order to keep that feeling of turning pages and viewing something real but not too real. V For Vendetta (2005) and 300 (2006) are some of the best examples of this. The colors and the landscapes are not quite realistic, and the fighting is almost believable. They are clearly comic books in the form of film. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) has very literal moments of comic visuals, and the fight scenes make no excuses, they are wild and crazy just as we would expect. Sin City captures both of these concepts beautifully. The colorful blood, the ridiculous fighting, the wonderfully overacted dialogue all remind the audience that they are watching a comic book. There are moments to make you say 'What the hell!' enough for five films.This is in contrast to comic book adaptations, which are significantly more malleable. Take the Marvel universe. Surely, there are wonderful and revolutionary films, but they take many forms. Ant Man (2015) is a comedy film. The Avengers series is epic sci-fi fantasy. And the Daredevil series on Netflix is a gritty crime drama. This is the advantage of having a huge amount of source material and an extensive canon to work with. You can pick and choose pieces to fit as you need them. Graphic novels are generally a lot more limited, and their ability to stay truthful to the source material is incredibly important in creating something that both new audiences and die-hard fans of the work will appreciate.The second advantage was having Robert Rodriguez as the director and Quentin Tarantino making a guest appearance. Rodriguez has an excellent ability to keep a film true to its intentions, even if the film itself is not particularly amazing. His later projects after Sin City show this pretty nicely. Planet Terror (2007) is a masterpiece of camp and gross-out horror. It is cartoonish and sarcastic without making any excuse to become realistic or heartfelt. Machete (2010) is a non-stop highlight reel of carnage. Just like the 'fake' trailer that inspired it, it was ridiculous and amazing. Spy Kids (2001) and Spy Kids 2 (2002), which are altogether mediocre films, should have had no staying power whatsoever. Yet the film's names still resonate with many and the thumb people and guy with four heads still give me nightmares, at least. Somehow the success of these films was enough even to convince a studio to make a fourth installment ten years later.Sin City stays aware of itself from top to bottom, and from start to finish. The musical accompaniment is perfectly noir. Every actor has bought into the concept as so each character, no matter how minor, plays an important role in making the world (un)believable. The sets are clearly built in some studio, but it doesn't matter. We know that behind the walls is just some wooden paneling holding everything together, just like we know that a book is bound together by glue and threads, but it doesn't stop us from being totally engrossed.
Many films fail to maintain this truthfulness, and that brings them from great movies to something simply good or acceptable. Take, for example, nearly any major Disney Studios release from the last ten to twenty years. The Disney execs are so intent on keeping films inside of a basic and successful formula that they lose their sense of authenticity. They have to shoehorn in romance, rebellion, an evil villain and the hero's journey into any film whether it fits or not, because that is what the audiences want. These movies will always be successful, that's Disney's power, but they rarely get discussed in top lists during the years in review.Sequels also especially fall into this trap because they stray too far from what they originally intended. Perhaps there is a change in directors, producers or writers, but even when they stay the same this can happen. Take IT (2017) and IT: Chapter Two (2019). What made the original so terrifying was its portrayal of the monster and the feeling of helplessness that was inspired in every audience member. Thirty minutes into the second film, though, this feeling is lost. IT is no longer omnipotent or villainous. He is more mischievous and manipulative. These traits would be okay if the whole construct of this universe didn't hinge on the monstrosity of the villain. IT: Chapter Two has none of the authenticity, and therefore none of the power of the first film.Sin City is a fantastic film in its own right, but it is a lesson too. A lesson on how to take a concept and run with it for two hours to the very apex of that idea. Perhaps some artists are worried about taking something too far. Well, I say not far enough. Push it to the extreme and see what happens. Let your characters become caricatures if the framework is already a caricature of reality. No one will blame you for making something silly and weird if it makes them think. The feeling of Sin City resonated in my mind for years even before I rewatched it recently. This is not because it stuck to a formula and made some generically marketable, but because it took the truth of itself to the very extreme that it could and made something so cartoonish it became a lifelike work of art.",8,0,1,13 April 2020
