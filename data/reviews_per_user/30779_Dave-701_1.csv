Alien 3," Damn Good!
","Okay so Alien 3 wasn't quite as good as Alien or wasn't nearly as good as Aliens but in my own opinion it was far better than that bloody terrible Alien Resurrection. First off it had that creepy Alien atmosphere, you know that claustrophobic feeling that you felt in the previous two. Another reason to why I like it was it was much darker in a way (Ripley killing herself), and David Fincher delivered it well. It was well acted and again Sigourney Weaver was great as Ellen Ripley. There is a lot of mixed reviews about this movie - mostly bad but I say check it out! If you were expecting something greater than Aliens you will be disappointed but like I said it's better than Alien Resurrection! You either like it or you lump it!",Null,0,3,30 September 1999
