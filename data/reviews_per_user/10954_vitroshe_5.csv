50 First Dates," SWEET
","I recently saw 50 first dates on an airplane. Usually i don't rent movies on planes but i heard a lot about this movie and it was a long flight so i did. I thought it was a cute, sweet movie, but pretty basic. I did not like Rob Snyder in it and thought he totally over acted! He was not believable at all and I think he hurt many scenes and was very annoying. Adam Sandler played a slightly more serious character than his usual character that you see in all of his movies. I have never been impressed with his acting. Drew on the other hand carried the movie as far as I was concerned! She had the toughest part as the one with amnesia and she really pulled it off. I also liked the story line which kept the movie together. I am glad i saw this on the plane as i would not have been happy if i rushed to the movies to see it. I think it is a nice, mindless video rental movie when you can't find something better on the shelf.",Null,0,0,26 September 2004
Meet the Parents," A laugh a minute
","Well, I finally rented Meet the Parents and know why everyone loved it and can't wait for the sequel to come out which i understand will be out soon. First I love Robert Dinero and everything he does since Taxi Driver. Again, he was magnificent, but this time his character although straight, was one of the funniest, believable fathers i have seen on film. Knowing a friend in the CIA, i can truly believe how he went about interrogating Ben Stiller in some of the funniest moments i have seen in a movie. Ben Stiller was equally as funny as the son in law to be trying to impress the future parents, but only getting into trouble every step of the way. I loved the story, the characters and I really felt bad for Ben. What a fun movie and I will not wait until video for the sequel!",Null,0,1,26 September 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Very scary movie!
","I usually don't go to horror movies, but i wanted to see Shawn of the Dead, so I decided to see Dawn of the Dead first. I thought the movie was scary and it kept me on the edge of the seat. The zombies and special effects were very good and I kept telling myself that it was only a movie. I am not sure I actually enjoyed the movie as it felt more like a roller coaster ride, thrilling, but not real enjoyable! I thought the acting was average, but the movie kept my attention wondering when would be the next time I would jump out of my seat. I thought it was also very gory, and would not let my children see it. I hope I don't have nightmares! But I guess as far as horror stories go, this movie does what it is supposed to do.",Null,0,0,26 September 2004
Shaun of the Dead," SCARY MOVIE OR COMEDY?
","Well, I thought I would watch Dawn of the Dead before I saw Shawn of the Dead, which a friend told me I should do first. My friend from UK saw it and said it was one of the best movies he had seen. I am always suspect of UK humor as he was a big Monty Python fan as well as Benny Hill and I did not like either one of them. Anyway, in this case he was correct and I did agree. Shawn was a very good movie. It was strange in that I laughed and was scared all in one movie. I liked Shawn and really felt for him. The special effects of the movie were very good and I thought there was more gore, blood, guts etc...than some of the scenes in Dawn of the Dead. I liked some of the crazy humor, but some I thought was stupid. It seemed like teenagers really liked the movie in the audience. The bottom line is that I was entertained. As with Dawn, this is not a movie to take the kids to.",Null,0,1,26 September 2004
Radio," GOOD MOVIE!
","I really enjoyed Radio and think it was one of the nicest movies I have seen. I think it a movie for everyone and teaches many lessons about life. I was also amazed to find out that the move was based on a real man. With all the tough road blocks Radio came across he continued to move forward even though the future was uncertain and he didn't have the mental capacity to understand much around him! I thought that Cuba Gooding Jr. played a tremendous role and should win an Oscar for this. I felt for him so much and it made me cry because of some of the hell he went through. I also thought Ed Harris played an incredible role as the coach. This movie really moved me and made my laugh, cry and ultimately feel good at the end! What a movie!",Null,62,73,26 September 2004
