The Legend of Bagger Vance," Sometimes, people just need to pull the stick out of their ass
","This isn't really a 10 star movie. But after reading all the magic negro stuff and complaints about the characters are too wooden, and that Matt Damon and Will Smith can't act, I gave it a 10 to balance out against all the bitter people who like to go on the internet and slag stuff, I bumped up what in reality is probably more fairly scored as a 7 or 8.In my opinion, Will Smith is excellent in this film, possibly one his best performances ever. Is he a bit young to be a guru to anybody? Maybe, but I find him utterly convincing and as the film reveals, it's not really ultimately important how that character looks. If anything, I think it adds more strength to the story by not giving that role to someone like Morgan Freeman and for the 1930's South, a black man caddying for a white golfer is fairly reasonable. And I think Damon does a good job of conveying his inner turmoil without saying too much. Anyone who has ever had a crisis of self can relate to this film, I think.Without spoiling the film or ending, I will just say that if you like movies about people overcoming adversity and putting their burdens behind them, it's a quality film for you.",10,0,1,21 July 2014
The Hangover," The problem with this movie is that it just isn't funny
","I'm not above juvenile humor. The 40 Year Old Virgin and Forgetting Sarah Marshall were at times tasteless, often juvenile, and hilarious. Knocked Up, less so, but with more heart. Wedding Crashers was laugh out loud funny a lot of the time as it continue to go way too far.I laughed maybe....*maybe* three times at most during this movie. Including the supposedly 'laugh so hard' sequence during the credits. The characters are unlikeable, the plot is basically 'Dude Where's My Car' in Vegas, and the jokes fall way flat. That several notable critics think this movie is great either means that I haven't had nearly enough drunken misadventures to relate to this film or that there is a 'stupid' pandemic in this country that puts swine flu to shame.For anyone who hasn't seen this movie yet and is unsure whether to trust the negative reviews or the positive reviews, I say this. Find someone who has seen this movie whose opinion on movies you almost always agree with. If they say you'll like it, go and see it and join in with the stupids who find this rehashed tripe hilarious. If you're going based on hype, you may end up as disappointed as I was.Oh and BTW, there's no way this movie belongs anywhere near the Top 250 of all time. It's not in the Top 250 of this decade, though it's solidly in the Top 10 of worst movies I've ever paid to see.",1,49,100,3 July 2009
