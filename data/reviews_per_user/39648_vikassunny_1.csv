Blade Runner 2049," What did I watch.
","Watched this movie, it was pathetically slow and hardly any storyline. 8.1 rating...must be done mistakenly...worst action movie so far, slowest in such a way that you can doze of and woke up to see story hardly have moved. Post movie I asked myself...what did I watch.",1,5,15,9 September 2018
