Antz," Animation is terrific, and so is the writing
","This is a great movie, it is almost more for Adults and Teens than Children, I think many jokes might go over younger viewer's heads, they will probabbly enjoy A Bug's Life better, and that was also suprisingly good..",Null,0,0,13 February 1999
Catch Me If You Can," Easily one of the most entertaining movies of 2002...
","This movie was great.  The acting was great and I sat there just waiting for what Frank would pull next.  This movie deserves to be nominated as one of the best movies of the year, but I don't think it will be nominated, only because it seems the Academy will go for a darker, more serious film (The Hours, About Schmidt), still Oscar or no oscar, this film was probably the most entertaining movie of the year and one of my favorites.  The films pace really picks up at the middle of the film and just takes off from there. Tom Hanks' character of Hanratty is a great change from his usually characters and Leonardo DiCaprio is great as well as Frank.  Christopher Walken, Amy Adams and Martin Sheen have GREAT supporting roles which really tie this film together. Very Entertaining, Very good.. A",Null,0,0,27 December 2002
Minority Report," Steven Speilberg is a genius...
","I really, really enjoyed this movie. It was engaging and very interesting. The last movie Speilberg did was A.I., and I greatly enjoyed that as well, but I think as a whole this movie has a better ending and its more in depth. They are simmilar though, the lighting in both films are simmilar and both have some cameos in them (AI had Chris Rock and Robin Williams' voice work while there are some fast cameos in M.R.-William Mapother (Tom's cousin), Cameron Diaz and Cameron Crowe.) But anyways, the story is terrific and the acting is very well done. I think of this movie as a mixture of Matrix and Memento with a little bit of The Fugitive. All in all, this is one great movie, hopefully it will catch on.",8,0,0,24 June 2002
Meet the Parents," --Hilarious, a must see--
","Talk about a great way of getting people to see a great movie. This movie has great comedy and the whole idea of it is terrific. Its like 'There's Something about Mary' and 'Father of the Bride'. I can totally see why this has gotten such great reviews and done so great at the box office. Ben and Robert are very funny in this. The only bad thing about it is that in the previews they gave away too much of the funniest scenes, but its still great..So if you want to see a movie that is very funny, see this!",Null,0,0,10 November 2000
Unbreakable," --Fantastic, but don't listen to any negative comments from anyone...
","-Many people were dissapointed by this movie, however, I thought this movie was very very well done. What do people have against this movie anyway?? its terrific, and very original.I think that the reason why some people are disappointed by this is because it isn't the sixth sense, its different.The Sixth Sense was very very good, but so is this. People go in the theater expecting the sixth sense, but they get something just as good, but different and they are disappointed..go figure.

Inglourious Basterds," Just Watch It.. Its Tarantino..
","After watching the first hour of this movie, I came upon a theory that I think makes a lot of sense as to why the movie Grindhouse wasn't a hit: They don't know how to market Quintin Tarantino. The previews show Inglorious Basterds as a fun, gory, thrill ride and in reality, it isn't. It isn't that I didn't like the film, it was just that I was expecting a Kill Bill style action-fest and it was pretty talky. The good news is that since Quintin Tarantino can write like no other, that makes the movie very entertaining. What I really love about this movie is the brilliant performances. I usually hate the saying that something is 'a revelation', but Christof Waltz really is. I hope he wins a best supporting actor Oscar for playing the charming and mostly evil Hans Landa. I also thought the two actresses, Melanie Laurent AND the overall underrated Diane Kruger were fantastic.QT is just awesome B++++",7,0,4,10 January 2010
Finding Nemo," Is there anything that Pixar Can't do? Finding Nemo is Spectacular!
","Pixar is my favorite animation company, I think its superior to what Disney is now, but when Walt was in charge, Disney was better. I think the smartest move Disney's made in recent history was teaming up with Pixar because without Toy Story and the others, who knows where Disney would be.I can't wait for Pixar's next movie- 'The Incredibles' to come out, because the trailer that is shown at the begining of Finding Nemo is absolutely hilarious. Finding Nemo is brilliant. Everything about it is interesting, Marlin is wonderfully voiced by Albert Brooks and Dory provides funny, but in some times annoying commentary from Ellen Degeneres. I love the look of Finding Nemo, there are some scenes that its hard to believe they aren't real. The Shark's 12 step program is great.  Another great highlight of Finding Nemo is the scenes in the fishtank in the Dentist's office.  I loved all the unique and funny personalities of all the fish: the fish afraid of germs, the one that had mulitiple personalities, the one that loves bubbles, the dirty one, the crab that loves cleaning, the starfish who's the lookout, etc. I also loved how the fish are really interested in the dentist's work and give commentary about what procedure's he's doing. The fish were great, in fact those animated fish in that little tank have more characterization and personality than the entire mean cast of '2 Fast 2 Furious'.Well, I could go on and on, but I think you get the point. I loved Finding Nemo, and I can't wait for 'THE INCREDIBLES'..

The Mummy," Could have been better, but it wasn't a total waste of time
","The Mummy, had some exciting parts, and some other funny moments, but to be honest I was a little disappointed because it took way too long for this film to get going, I don't think I wasted my time or money on this film but I expected more.  Brendan Fraser is very good in this, don't get me wrong because I think he was right for the role.",4,0,0,11 August 1999
The Others," Overrated..
","I rented this movie after hearing how great it was.  I went in thinking it would be like the sixth sense, and maybe that was a mistake, because that was a masterpiece and this, well, was not.  The film isn't terrible, and I think its worth renting, and maybe it was just me, but I didn't really think it was scary or very interesting at that.  I will say, however, that the ending is very well done and ALMOST makes up for the whole thing, but not quite. It just seems unbalanced, like the ending was awesome, but the rest of the film is a let down.  Overall: Possibly Worth a rental, but its not the 'Sixth Sense' that everyone says it is..I'd give it a C.Thanks",Null,2,4,15 February 2003
Elf," Cute and Humorous but not hilarious- This coming from a HUGE Ferrell Fan.
","First off, I think Will Ferrell is extremely talented and is no doubt going to become a very successful comedian and hopefully ELF will be looked upon as a launching pad for his career. I didn't have THAT many problems with Elf- mainly is that I never thought it was hilarious. It made me laugh in some scenes but the previews once again gave away too much.  I thought the begining started out very promising but dropped about halfway through.  The ending (involving Santa and the chase scene in Central Park) didn't seem to fit the movie. But anyways, I wouldn't say ELF is a waste of time, just not the 'HOLIDAY CLASSIC' everyone is talking about. If you really want a funny, good hearted comedy go see 'SCHOOL OF ROCK'.Thanks",Null,0,2,18 November 2003
Lost in Translation," Scenic view
","I enjoyed bits and pieces of this film more than I did the whole thing. I don't know, maybe it was the mood I was in, but it was a little too slow paced for me and never really went anywhere.  But, thats the end of my negative critique on it.  I enjoyed the scenes when they were in the streets, or when Charlotte goes into an arcade and just observes the scenery.  The scenery to me is what makes this film memorable. Sofia Coppola rightfully is nominated.  One of my favorite parts in this movie is when Bob is having photo shoots done, very funny.a solid B.",Null,0,0,13 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Fantastic Fantasy
","First Off- I have read the first Book on which this is based on, and I greatly enjoyed it. Second of all, It took me a while to convince myself that I wanted to see this movie, but after reading the book I knew I didn't want to miss it. This movie is spectacular. It is my favorite film since I saw A.I. (*A very, very, very underated work of art) Its really hard for me to chose which film I enjoyed more, but I think I will have more support if I say Lord of the Rings, so I'll just say that. Even so, Peter Jackson is BRILLIANT in bringing this film to life, a task so difficult I couldn't even imagine. The cast is top notch. All of the Hobbits are funny and inteteresting.

Cast Away," Without a doubt one of the years best films.. no question about it.
","Unlike last year, this year didn't have as many good movies as last, but this year is definately not a bad year.  Last night (my birthday) I saw 'CAST AWAY' and let me start by saying that I expected A LOT, I've known about this movie for a little over a year and I couldn't wait to see it. I thought I may have been dissapointed that it may be too long, or even too boring, but it was far from it.This is a wonderfully created picture, I thought it was done so well on so many levels.  Many people I heard were not happy with the ending, but I won't say anything except, I wasn't..thats all I have to say about that (the ending)Like always, Tom Hanks is fabulous in this, not only does the audience feel like they are on the island with him, they feel his emotions, especially in the scenes with Wilson (who deserves an academy award for best supporting object)This movie is defiantely one unforgetable picture and if not number one, one of the top five best movies of the year.Thank You",7,0,0,28 December 2000
The Village," I REALLY liked it, except for 3 things..:Contains Spoilers :
","---This contains Spoilers, don't read if you plan to see the movie---First off, I really liked 'The Village' and I think its M Night's best film since 'The Sixth Sense'. I heard a lot of people saying that the beginning was boring, I thought it was all very interesting. I do, have 3 minor problems with the film, they are:-The lack of suspense and or scary scenes- I know M. Night doesn't want to show us too much, but I think he could have scared us at least a half dozen more times.  I thought the scenes with the townspeople were interesting, but I wanted to be scared more.  Show more scenes at night with the creatures or something.The second problem was: -Plot Holes. Sure there's probably a dozen if you try hard enough, but the major one for me is with Noah. Why in the world would he go after Ivy in that suit? That never made sense to me. Did that costume take control over him? He was in love with her, they say. If you have an answer to this, please email it to me, because I'd really like to knowand lastly: -What happens to Lucius? They never say, and that bothers me. I wish it would just be resolved.I did like a lot of things in it, like the music, and I even liked the twist ending, even though some people didn't. Bryce Dallas Howard is fantastic in this, I was really amazed. She really has great presence on screen and she brings so much to this film. A",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
Spirited Away," The Best Animated Film of 2002..
","This movie in my opinion is the best Animated movie I saw in 2002.  It deserves a nomination and a win in the 'Best Animated Feature' category at the Academy Awards, because its very good.  The film has a great feel to it with amazing visual effects.  The story is SO original and its beautifully told. I saw the Japanese version with subtitles, so I don't know how the dubbed version is, but I was amazed with what I saw.  The setting was so magical and the characters were very interesting.  This is one movie not to be missed.",Null,0,1,28 December 2002

Man on the Moon," The 'Man On The Moon' is definatley smiling
","One Word to describe Jim Carrey's performance in this movie: WOW!..Jim WAS Andy Kaufman, his motions, voice, and characteristics looked and felt like it was Andy Kaufman, what a great job on that.  I've only seen Andy on TAXI, and also on SNL, and an ABC special (im only 15, I wasn't born when he was a big star) but I learned a lot about him from watching this. 
I think Jim Carrey gives the performance of his career, which is even better than his terrific performance in THE TRUMAN SHOW.Jim deserves an oscar nomination, and I think and hope he'll get it.9 out of 10(it also inspired by IMDB NICKNAME) -formally ADAMSAND-",7,0,0,23 December 1999

","Seabiscuit, so far is my favorite movie this year. I love the way it was made and the acting and race scenes are very well done. Seabiscuit should be recognized in March for the Academy Awards, but knowing how they have short memories, it might not be, but that doesn't matter, because this really is a great movie.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Very Well done, but not quite as good as the first..
","This film is of course the second of a trilogy and the biggest problem is that it really doesn't have a beginning or an end, but I think I will enjoy this film when I see it along with the other 2 as a whole.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this film and the special effects scenes easily surpass the ones of the original, but I just thought the story wasn't with this one as much as it was with the original.  The characters are great of course, but I was disapointed that Ian McKellan's Gandalf didn't get much screen time and I was even surprised that the film focuses more on Aragorn than Frodo. I admire this film because it is very different and the scenery is excellent. Its a very well done film and I would definately say that this film is one of the best films of 2002.

The Incredibles," GREAT on SO MANY LEVELS!
","This has got to be one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in a long, long time. I loved pretty much everything about this movie. I LOVED the retro feel to it. The characters are SO well written and Syndrome is probably one of the greatest super villains i've seen in a movie, just because he combines comic relief with pure evil and his reasons for seeking revenge is both interesting and original. I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie, because it works for just about anybody. Men, Women, Kids, Grandparents (I think). It works as a comedy, adventure, suspense, and as a cartoon. This just proves how much greater PIXAR is than dreamworks. I mean Shrek was...cute, but it definitely doesn't have the depth that the Incredibles has.Would it be strange if I said that this should be nominated for Best Picture?A",Null,0,0,20 November 2004
School of Rock," The funniest movie in years! SO ENTERTAINING! I hope Sandler is taking notes..
",I LOVED this movie.  Finally a comedy comes along that doesn't give away all its funny parts and it entertains for the entire movie.  Jack Black is amazing. He's likable and hilarious and there is NOBODY who could have played this role better.  Another genius part of this movie is the kids. Having the kids actually playing the instruments adds so much to this and they are INCREDIBLE. Every one of them.  Basically this is a nice refreshing change.  This movie has a great message- be who you are and its very well done.  Call me crazy but I think its the best movie so far this year.  I loved it.Thanks For Reading..,Null,1,1,23 October 2003
Gran Torino," A really good movie that shouldn't be nominated for anything.
","Gran Torino was a good, solid movie. By reading my review (First review in over 3 years, by the way) you might think that I didn't like this movie, but that isn't the case.Gran Torino is a good movie, just not a great one. I think that is because it WAS predictable and rather cartoonish. A lot of stereotypes were used in a movie that wants to abolish stereotypes and I don't really get that. I think the ending was something that people could have predicted about 40 minutes before it actually happened (or maybe even sooner) That being said, I liked this movie. It never lagged and was always interesting. Eastwood was great and he is a fantastic director. That is enough to recommend it.",7,1,5,28 December 2008
Toy Story 2," WOW!
","Toy Story2 was excellent, I mean it was so entertaining and it seemed that most everyone in the theatre enjoyed it, I know I did..The characters were soo funny and interesting.  The actors who supplied the voices were very good, and I give BIG credit for the people of Disney and Pixar for making such a terrific movie.  The cameo from Geri (if you didnt see A BUGS LIFE, you proabably dont know but, he was the guy at the beginning playing chess in the short movie before the actual movie) was great and the new characters and the old characters made this movie spectacular, and I totally recommend this film to the toy lover in all of us.",Null,0,0,27 November 1999

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A magical holiday classic
","First off- I really, really enjoyed this movie. Very much. It had the same feeling of the book(s) but of course it couldn't cover as much as the book could (it would be near impossible to do it). For instance, a lot of the characters didn't have as much screen time as they are mentioned in the book. (It seems that Snape, Quirrell, George, Fred and Percy Weasly had bigger roles; and Hedwig, I can't even remember the name being mentioned) But really, that doesn't matter. What matters is that the movie is good or not, and it is.There aren't a lot of family movies that capture the kind of humor and adventure/drama that this one does. Just for record, I've read all the books, so that might make me a bit biased, but really its a good adaption.The acting is superb. I honestly think there should be Academy Award nominations for this movie, both in acting and the movie itself.-Richard Harris, Maggie Smith,Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane are PERFECT!!, they are so good at capturing the essence of their characters, that shouldn't go without a nomination.-Also, Daniel Radcliffe does a very, very good job as Harry. I liked him in this part because you can tell he wasn't overly acting like some child stars do; instead his shy/quiet nature was exactly like Harry Potter -Emma Watson and Rupert Grint were also PERFECT as their roles of Hermione and Ron, respectively. They really have a talent.-Great Movie.",6,0,1,22 November 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," -They're improving! Thats great..
","I liked the first Harry Potter. I thought it was a very good children's movie and this one is even better.  Ok, well the first thing is that people shouldn't expect these movies to be like the books, because they aren't.  I think the cast (especially Daniel Radcliffe) finally felt at ease in their roles in this version.  I think the first film, he was a bit nervous and now he's getting into the character more.  Out of the 3 kids, I think that Emma Watson is the best actor. She IS Hermione and she is perfectly cast.  This movie is a Bit long, but it is good. My favorite scene of the entire movie is the WONDERFUL scene at the end involving Fawkes the Phoneix.  The part where he cries is so inspiring and so wonderfully written and with the music, its just fantastic.  The scene is one of the best scene's in the whole entire Potter franchise so far. Overall: I look forward to the next Harry Potter movie and those that follow.  Hopefully the new director (i forgot his name, Sorry) will do as good of a job, IF NOT BETTER than Christopher Columbus.

Now, I never saw the Shawshank Redemption (but I now want to)so I can't compare it.  Althought I think the cast couldn't have been better. Michael Clarke Duncan totally blew me away with his acting abilities, and of course so did Tom Hanks.  David Morse was good, so was the rest of the supporting cast (James Cromwell, Michael Jeter, Bonnie Hunt, Dabbs Greer, etc.) Now, If you didn't care for it, I guess its an opinion, but I just thought it was a terrific work of art.*****",8,0,0,11 December 1999
Sherlock Holmes," Underwhelming
","Jude Law is one of my favorite actors and I'm starting to really enjoy Robert Downey Jr after Iron Man. Guy Ritchie is stylish and can create a FUN experience at the movies (LSATSB). But after watching the first previews for Sherlock Holmes, I admit I was a bit underwhelmed. It seemed like they were going for style and very little substance. I think that is a shame, considering the substance is Sherlock Holmes, a character with a lot of potential. There is no doubt Robert Downey Jr. is charismatic and fun, but I never really saw him as Sherlock Holmes, but rather Tony Stark playing Sherlock Holmes. For me to recommend a movie, it has to stay with me, but with a boring plot that I didn't care about, this movie was forgettable. The occasional bits of humor aren't even close to recommending it.

Bruce Almighty," One of the weakest Jim Carrey films..
","I didn't care much for Bruce Almighty for only one reason: It wasn't really that funny. I mean, sure some bits were funny, but like MANY comedies they show all the funny parts in the trailers.  I really didn't find Jim Carrey that funny, I mean, all the jokes were very obvious and the story fell flat. Morgan Freeman was great as God, I also liked Catherine Bell in there, even though she was pretty much useless. Carrey and Aniston (Who plays the same character in about every movie she's in sans 'The Good Girl) were pretty much wasted. The movie  didn't really take any chances, instead it went for the obvious jokes and was too careful not to offend anyone, and it was obvious of that.  I think the concept would have been better with a better script. I think some jokes like when Carrey turns into Clint Eastwood was great but obvious jokes about the dog peeing were pretty stupid.C- Thanks for reading",Null,1,2,25 May 2003
Signs," Creepy and Intelligent, a good movie..
","I am a huge M. Night Shymalan fan. I think he is such a great director. It bothers me to hear such bad remarks about this movie, only because people expect WAY too much from movies nowadays and it seems like with EVERY MOVIE there are always people that complain about how bad the movie is. I mean if you look in here on IMDB and look under the comments from people on your personal favorite movies, I can almost bet you that you will find some that don't like the movies. I've checked my five favorite movies of last year and the five oscar nominees and all of them have TONS of bad reviews of them, and I don't know why. But, I really enjoyed this movie, the feel of it, the look of it and to be simple: It was VERY scary.**Warning: Minor Spoilers ahead, please don't read if you dont want to know some key elements of the film, I dont want to spoil it for you**-Ok, first of all, if you want to see a film that shows guys chasing aliens around back and forth and so on, go see 'MEN IN BLACK', because in this movie, the scariest parts are when you don't see the aliens.-One of my favorite parts in this movie, was probably the scariest part in the movie. Its the 'video birthday party' scene. The reason why this part is so scary is because it seems so real. The look on the children's faces look frightened beyond belief and the camera moves just like an actual video taped segment.  This scene was so creepy, its one of my favorites in the film.<ul><li>I like how M.Night does NOT pander to the audience. He doesn't show us too much so we get sick of it, he shows us just enough, wanting more. If I can make one point of critique, I would ask that there were more scenes in the cornfield and the aliens, I enjoyed it so much, I wanted a little bit more, but all in all, this was a solid good movie.

X2: X-Men United," A flawed improvement..
","Without a doubt, the best part of the entire X-Men franchise (Comics, Movies, Cartoon Show, whatever) is the characters. I find them FACINATING. I think that this movie is much better than the original, but it is not perfect. The film drags, mostly near the end. It almost gets boring, but luckily, just when I was about to give hope on this movie, it does a turnaround and gives us ONE HECK of a good ending. The new characters introduced are very interesting, especially Nightcrawler. I think Allan Cumming was a great choice for the role. Also, the fight between Lady Deathstrike and Wolverine was pretty cool. I also enjoyed scenes with Rogue, Iceman and Pyro. Well, I'm glad to see that they have improved over the overrated X-Men 1. HOPEFULLY X3 will feature my favorite character- GAMBIT.

A Walk to Remember," Actually not all that bad..
","First off- there are things that I liked about this movie, and there are things that I didn't. First the things I did like: -Mandy Moore's first starring role in a main movie was a bit of a stretch (At least she wasn't playing herself; instead her character worked for me, as the shy girl- Compared to Britney Spears' upcoming movie, her part seemed a lot more different than her regular persona) -The chemistry between Landon and Jamie seemed to work and they seemed right for each other. -Landon's friends all seemed stuck up and jerks except for the black guy, he seemed like he really cared and was a nice guy and provided some funny lines. -Jamie's father- Peter Coyote seemed perfect for his role as the father of Jamie. - A very smooth move made by Landon- I won't reveal what it is but heres a hint: It involves the 'state line'.Okay, now some stuff that I didn't like about the movie--The tension between Landon and his father- it could have been out of the movie and wouldn't have been missed. - There were some sappy moments, but not as many as there could have been - The fact that I knew the ending before the movie began. (My friend told me)Anyways- this was a pretty good movie, not the best but if there is nothing better to see, its worth it. It really could have been a made for tv movie, but that doesn't mean its a bad thing.Thanks",Null,0,0,10 February 2002

They used to be funny.'The Breakfast Club' cares about its characters and embraces them. There aren't scenes that make you want to puke from disgust like in some comedies now a days, instead you learn from the characters through what they say- the way it was supposed to be. Also- this movie doesn't require a lot of special effects, none at all, but is still more entertaining than some movies that are filled with it. 'The Breakfast Club' is a great comedy, but it isn't filled with raunch. All characters are well defined and they fit stereotypes, but they all work. Its hard to say who my favorite is, but Allison definately steals the show! =A Classic=",Null,0,0,29 April 2002
