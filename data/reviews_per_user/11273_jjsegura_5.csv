The Hangover," Todd Phillips' best movie yet!!!
","Similar to actors, when a director puts out several movies that I enjoy (e.g.; Eastwood, Spielberg, Bay, etc.), I tend to follow their projects closely. Not only their current projects, but also their future ones. Phillips is the next great director and his genre is comedies. His first movie I enjoyed was Road Trip (2000) which he then followed with what I considered not only his personal best, but probably the funniest movie of my generation Old School (2003). These were followed by a couple of so-so movies Starsky & Hutch (2004) and School for Scoundrels (2006). These two were not terrible, just not up to par with his prior gems. Well, my friends, Phillips is back and with a bang with The Hangover. Unlike his prior movies, there are no bona fide star, but I can assure you that this movie will launch the four main characters, Cooper, Galifianakis, Helms and Bartha, into stardom. The movie has a simple premise; four friends go to Vegas to celebrate a bachelor party only to have everything go completely wrong. Like that hasn't been done before. But what makes this film special is that from the time you sit down to watch the movie, until the very end (make sure you stay for the credits), you are laughing non-stop. The dialog, the situations, etc. had me laughing hysterically. The other thing that makes this movie great is that even after you leave the theater, you might be watching TV, working or doing some other activity, a couple of lines from the movie will cross your mind and you'll start laughing again. That is what I consider a great movie. When you think about a movie and enjoy it as if you were watching it. Of course the movie is not for everyone, as Phillips tends to push the envelope (some people may consider some of the scenes offensive), but I think it really works. This movie won't win any Oscars, but others will now be following Mr. Phillips' career very closely.",9,1,3,26 June 2009
The Ring," Really Scary!!
","After watching countless horror movies (13th Ghost, The Haunting, etc.), it's been a long, long time since I've experienced the gasping and hair-raising sensation from watching the Ring.  The director did an excellent job at elevating those tense moments without giving it all away. I even rented Ringu to see how they compare, and not to sound like a 'homer', the U.S. version was much better.  I felt it was more intense. This movie is so good, I have to list in as one of the top 10 horror movies I have seen:1. The Excorcist 2. The Omen 3. Night Of The Living Dead (1968) 4. The Sixth Sense 5. The Ring 6. The Blair Witch Project 7. The Thing (1982) 8. Poltergeist 9. A Nightmare On Elm Street 10. The ShiningLet's just hope that unlike the Japanese version, this doesn't lead to a slew of sequels.",8,0,1,31 March 2003
I Am Legend," Very moving and well directed
","I was really looking forward to seeing 'I Am Legend', from the moment I found out earlier this year. In preparation to seeing the movie, I watched Vincent Price in 'The Last Man on Earth' and Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man'. Even though the main ideas of the two prior versions were the same (last man, virus, night creatures, etc.), the delivery varied for their particular time. So I was intrigued to see how the storyline would be adapted to our time.Boy, the first thing that struck me was the set. Being born and growing up in New York City, it really hit me hard to see the devastation and isolation of the city that 'Never Sleeps'. The streets, the abandoned cars, the bridges, the U.N.,etc. It really hit home. Then we see a much slender, leaner Will Smith trying to cope with the fact that he was alone. His portrayal of Robert Neville is Oscar worthy. Very moving. I find the origin of the virus quite interesting as it comes as a side effect for a cure for cancer. The prior two movies used a plague (The Last Man on Earth) and germ warfare (The Omega Man) to explain the virus. The use of a cure that transforms into a virus gives it an ironic twist.The movie runs for about an hour and forty minutes, but is very fast paced and well directed. The creatures, even though they are CGI, were creepy and mixed well into the movie. I'm not sure they could have gotten the same effect from live actors. I will refrain from giving any more details to avoid spoiling the movie.Very entertaining.",9,6,11,19 December 2007
Transformers," One Hell Of A Ride!!!
","I have seen other movies directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock and Armageddon), so I knew going in that there would be non-stop action and explosions from beginning to end. Boy, the man doesn't disappoint. The action scenes were impressive, the actors were good and the CGI was top notch. I also have to say that just like her last name, Megan is a 'Fox'!! Of course some people are going to kill the movie because of the script, clich√©s, etc., but when I go to see an action movie I expect to be entertained, which the movie does from beginning to end. Usually in movies that run over two hours, you have lull moments, but that was not the case in 'Transformers'. I can't wait for the DVD and I will be first in line when 'Transformers 2' comes out. I give it a 9 out of 10 (I gave it a 10 to boost it up).",10,2,5,13 July 2007
300," Another Timeless Masterpiece!!!
","What an excellent piece of cinema. The visual is stunning, the actors are great and the directing incredible. I have seen Gerard Butler in other movies, but in 300 he dominates the screen. His character, dialog and sheer power place him with the likes of Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. The supporting cast is phenomenal. The movie is fast paced and does not contain any lulls. The battle scenes are well done. I saw myself cheering for the 300 Spartans as they faced incredible odds. Truly a stunning movie that will definitely become a classic. I know it is only March, but this definitely has to contend for a few Oscars, including Best Actor for Gerard Butler.",10,3,8,22 March 2007
