The Perks of Being a Wallflower," To Help Stabilize The Score
","Really great vibe. Many teenage films I have watched. This one stands out in several perspective. The cast is glamorous, though Emma do look a bit old fashioned (but hey, the movies set in the 90s right? It's not like popular girls are always the same through out the years) Miller as Patrick is funny and has weight. The plot is great, even though I hear there were a lot of deletions from the books. Important characters arc are very well developed, and I have to say this is probably the furthest step a teenage film production has taken.In many ways, The Perks Of Being a Wallflower succeeded. Delivered great messages, gags, and heartfelt moments. Go watch it!",8,0,0,29 May 2019

War of the Worlds," Well made
","Just to be fair, this film's brilliance and shorts are quite extreme. The generally bad impression made about this movie is because of the lack of story and character depiction. To be honest, for a bored young adult like me, the horror and the disturbance delivered by this blockbuster is refreshing. Who needs a story when the world is about to experience something so chaotic and grand? I know I don't. This whole film's approach to the event is appropriate. A bit more whining from the characters would definitely bore me. And I definitely don't want to take life lessons from a action movie.Honestly, this film serves its purpose. It was a good ride.",8,0,1,12 May 2019
