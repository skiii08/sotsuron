Requiem for a Dream," In memory of a dream
","The movie is based on the novel wrote by Hubert Shelby Jr. It was a good movie ,good directed by Darren Aronofsky ,I think he capture very well the particularities of each of the characters.The actors were chosen very well: Ellen Burstyn incredible in this part deserved the Oscar nominee, Jared Leto also probably played his best role in this movie,Marlon Wayans showed that he can play in other movies than comedies. The title of the movie is very symbolistic and leave place for many comments, requiem meaning in memory represents all that has been left from the characters dreams. I recommend this movie to all the people that want to go on the dangerous way of the drugs.",8,1,2,3 March 2005
City of God," Good, very good
","Wow,really good movie. The action of the movie is placed in the rough hoods in Rio and presents the hard life there or how the narrator says:'City of Gods has nothing to do with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards' It has everything-love,war,revenge,crime,funny.The movie can be seen in two opposite ways- of the child who wants to escape from the rough world and of the rest of the children from there who think the only place to make something in life is there. The actors match very well with the story ,also the director Fernando Mirelles done a very good job. In conclusion this movie deserve his spot in the top of the best movies ever made.",9,6,12,28 February 2005
