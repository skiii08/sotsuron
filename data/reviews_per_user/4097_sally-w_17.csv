The Finest Hours," A wonderful story
","A wonderful awe inspiring story based on a true event. Casey Affleck is wonderful as the ingenious engineer and Chris Pine is fantastic as the silent expert coast guard. Heart warming and earthy if a bit exaggerated (it is Disney after all) when tugging at your heart strings.2 hours passed really quickly and even though I knew what the result was going to be I felt engrossed with it.Well done a great watch, fabulous photography and scenery. Add to that good acting and production.An excellent watch.",9,1,8,5 February 2016
The Danish Girl," I read the book - this is a great rendition of it
","Brilliant acting. Eddie Redmayne deserves another Oscar for his performance as Einar Wegener / Lili Elbe. He transforms from the artist to a woman in a wonderfully engaging way that is so realistic. Well done. Beautifully filmed with all the richness and glory of the book I absolutely loved it.Alicia Vikander portrays his wife with amazing poise, grace and charm exactly as she is portrayed in the book. She must have been an incredibly brave woman in real life to manage to be so normal in such strange circumstances.Engaging and involving - a wonderful watch. (His other book the 19th Wife is also a good read:-)",8,2,5,5 February 2016
Ready Player One," OK - however you have to suspend your knowledge of the book completely
","The movie deviates majorly from the book which when you are expecting to see the book as a movie, disappointed my movie buddy something terrible. I however find it much easier to split the two and see them as separate.Some of the graphics were amazing however some of them were a bit lame and the plot changes meant the characters lost their depth.The movie was enjoyable and the music great. Once you have seen the movie read the book and you will enjoy it too.",8,0,1,31 March 2018
Closer," Complete crap
","This is what a friend of mine calls a train-crash movie. There is nothing to be understood and nothing to stop the plot just a bunch of people going down a road and they are all too stupid, lazy, idiotic to stop. Why would you want to watch it? Nothing made sense ever. Either the play was much better or there is too much hidden in this movie that I just don't get. (I also hated No Country for Old Men - in case you wonder what else I don't like.)There is absolutely no chemistry with the characters they are all like paper cardboard cutouts - I am guessing at least in part because there is nothing to like about any of them.",1,3,8,10 March 2012
American Hustle," O so slow
","The plot is a good one, very convoluted and quite cool. The movie is excruciatingly slow. It just doesn't keep you engaged. I loved Silver Linings Playbook and have watched it a couple of times. Of all of the cast Amy Adams who usually drives me nuts acts really well in the movie. Christian Bale is pretty good too but the plot and the pacing is tedious. I can't believe it rates a 7.8 - it just goes to show you have to make your own mind up.The story is a sting just like 'The Sting' and the fact that it is, is pretty easy to pick right from the beginning. That doesn't help either because all I could think of is I know how it will end you are just taking your time getting to it.",3,2,5,24 January 2014
Oblivion," I loved it
","I really liked this movie. It made me think and you had to concentrate to keep up. The plot has twists and turns and Tom Cruise was just the man for the job. He comes across as genuine and real which is great in a movie that takes several twists and turns. The photography is amazing - there are scenes of desert and water, hills and outer space and all are meticulously created with a very real feeling about them. They are all really engrossing. The other actors are believable and convincing which helps makes it convincing. I like movies that engross you in the way people are feeling and how they have to change the way the believe and what they do.",9,6,8,12 October 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Wonderful gripping moving and convincing
","I love slice of life movies and particularly ones that tell a real tale. I lost friends in the 80's in Sydney from AIDS. This movie brought it all back. My friends started disappearing, then there was AZt the saviour - well not quite. They disappeared but slower. I hung out with a bunch of gay guys, me and my straight partner. It was an accident of association. A bunch of mostly kiwis then one climbed out of the closet and we all became friends with a new group of people, gay people. I frequented gay nightclubs, The Laurels a take off on the academy awards for gays behaving badly, social events, weekends away, fabulous. I met Larry who the lead in Priscilla Queen of the Desert is based on. I also met people just like the queues at the clinic young, old, promiscuous and devoted loving couples.Anyway I wander. This film, which I saw with my 23 year old straight son was absolutely reliving it, right there, experience. I have read the book and I think the enactment was fantastic. Intelligent, unenlightened and working on it - amazing.The portrait of the fight with FDA was so good, haunting and a reflection on USA big brother knows best. Incredible to think that all this happened before the internet. He has to search through physical books and articles.I was also impressed that this didn't wallow into a pity party. It was at a time before AIDS was really understood so it could have easily.A great movie - I hope it gets a chance at an Oscar but then lots of movies I love never get anywhere near it and things I think are pointless and stupid do - who knows. My 23 year old loved it too. Well done Matthew McConaughey I think you did a great job and so did you Jared Leto as the role of the person who just can't give up the drugs.",9,1,1,21 February 2014
No Country for Old Men," This movie is horrible
",OK not everyone likes all movies. I hated Closer and this and the Star Wars I II and III. This for me was a meaningless load of drivel - what was the point? Either it is just so clever that I missed it or it really is crap. Javier Bardem goes around killing people and your point is? For me acts of random violence are just that meaningless acts of random violence. David Grey shooting people - if you were one of the people shot it would be terrible but there is no story in it for me - it just happened and this is how I see this movie. Sorry Coen Brothers and as for Oscars well I know they are a complete farce after this won one.,1,8,16,10 March 2012
Fifty Shades of Grey," I liked it
",Good on you Sam Taylor-Johnson. I have read the books - just think Mills and Boon. Flawed guy meets girl who helps him solve his problems. While it isn't exactly like the book it is close enough. I am a romantic female who likes a soppy movie.If you don't fancy a soppy love story for goodness sake don't go and see it. If you need a guide I hated 'No Country for Old Men' I love French and English movies where the watcher gets to think for themselves. I try not to watch movies with random violence and plot less (Fast and Furious).So forget what other people say go and enjoy it if it is your thing and it was mine:-),7,8,21,13 February 2015
Before Sunrise," Utterly engrossing
","Just my kind of movie - their relationship starts at a chance encounter and continues from there. It is just beautiful. The scenery is lovely. I really like the way they do normal things like drink coffee and eat meals just like we would if we were living this movie.The dialogue is fantastic - how amazing to have the memory of the relationships to create the dialogue and I love the phone scene brilliant. I wish I had thought of that when I was going out with guys.I am a complete romantic at heart so I found the way the story of their lives, likes and dislikes developed heart-warming and inspiring. Both this and the other movie appeared briefly at my art-house cinema and I didn't get to see them. Thanks Fatso for renting them to me.",9,0,0,17 June 2014
The Purge," Not bad
",Great idea - that one night of the year you can kill anyone you like. The problem is the rich think they are safe but are they? I am not sure why this lists as horror - it is much more of a Larry Niven sci-fi based on a premise that this is allowed under the American Constitution.The acting was very good including Rhys Wakefield as the chilling American student with 'rights'. This reminds me of all the KKK and other people who have rights based on the colour of their skin.I really liked and I am not much of a horror fan. Its shows society gone made.Worth a watch.,8,0,0,25 January 2014
Looper," An awesome science fiction treat
","This is a great science fiction story in the genre of Philip K Dick.This portrayal of a bleak future has a very realistic feel to it. There were lots of background intrigues which gave the story a very real feel. The characters were complex and interesting making it interesting to watch and there weren't many holes to distract me from the primary story.The story is complex, which makes it interesting, but not too complex to follow. It is involving as the background is filled in as the film goes along and some things remain a mystery which is not a bad thing.I think of it as a science fiction version of 'Animal Kingdom'.I hope they go on to make more like this. I also liked 'Source Code'; 'The Hunger Games'; (Battleships but the plot has a few problems); 'Inception' since I find that what else you like helps make me figure out whether I like what you like.",9,3,7,13 October 2012
John Wick: Chapter 2," I am so sorry this is pitiful
",In the first part of the movie everyone is martial arts fighting and no-one has a gun - how weird given there is a garage of bad Russian guys and the rest of the movie is nothing but guns. Yes I know you have to suspend judgement and logic some times at the movies but that really got to me. I love Keanu on any day and a movie with him in it is worth watching so I made myself forget that whole first part and watch the rest.My movie buddy had told me there is a #3 so I knew he didn't die.A pity really as #1 was excellent.,3,11,25,27 May 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," Tui moment - kiwis will get this
","Fantastic photography amazing car chases and vision of the apocalypse is chillingly realistic. Think Robert Heinlein and the religious nutters he thought would take over the world and you won't be far wrong.However the scene in the desert where the skimpily dressed women in white are bathing in a hose is a Tui moment (yeah right) use google to search for tui billboardsHere for foreigners if you want to understand the reference.The scenery is amazing and the creation of the world post gene fading explosions was amazing and for anyone who has seen outback Australia incredibly believable.I had a few heart stopping moments, however it was worth it.",8,0,7,4 July 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Dear Mel - it was brilliant
","While I will never forgive the absolutely unforgivably terrible way you have behaved in the past if you keep making movies like this I might renege just a little.A wonderfully human and humane story based on real people that warms the heart to watch and renews your faith in human kind.Andrew Garfield does an amazing job of being Doss and the script writer deserves an Oscar they didn't get one and to see the real people at the end is amazing especially when you find out some of the lines in the movie really did come out of people's mouths.Well done Mel, Sam, Vince and all the rest. Having been an extra myself I also pay tribute to all the extras who spent a long time in make-up and patiently lying around. Stunningly good. Amazingly human. Aroha to you all for telling such a great wonderful real story.",10,2,3,5 February 2018
Me Before You," Fantastic
",I have read the book and I will be interested to talk to my friend who hasn't. My only criticism is could you not have used one of our great kiwi actors - seriously you had to use an Australian pretending to be a kiwi badly. However the movie is lovely. I don't think I have seen a theatre in Masterton New Zealand as full as the one tonight and every one of us was thrilled to see it. They have kept the movie pretty much to the book which was great although I treat a movie as different from the book. Well done Sam Claflin I didn't see a single movement out of character. That must have been a tough thing to do so an impressive effort. I don't watch GOT so I had no preconceived ideas about Emilia Clarke and I thought she was great.A difficult subject and one that we have had several notable kiwi's go through. Well done Jojo Moyes.,9,7,10,18 June 2016
The Martian," Brilliant
","The 3D was some of the best I have seen - never intrusive and adding to the story. A hard science astronaut rescue. My companion is far more picky than I am and he only commented on 2 inconsistent things, I only 1, really high praise from him. 2 hours 20 of engrossing movie - I loved it.We were in a movie theatre that really great surround sound for pretty much $20NZ a ticket and it was worth every cent. Well done Reading Wellington - and the seats are comfortable for a long movie too and the place was packed.I loved the filming of the Martian scenery - it made for an emotionally captivating experience.",9,2,59,2 October 2015
