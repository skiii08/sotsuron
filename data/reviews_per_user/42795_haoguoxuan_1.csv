Blade Runner 2049," the movie sucks!
",i'm wondering if the director is a psychic. three women got killed and most importantly the killing process is depicted way too much detail and violence. You don't want to put that onto screen. Some jerks in the theater laughed for no reason. Only part is of interest is when Ford comes out.,2,7,17,8 October 2017
