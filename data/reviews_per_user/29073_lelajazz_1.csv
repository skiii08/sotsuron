Hereditary," Toni Collett is PHENOMENAL
","This movie broke me. I do not understand anyone who says it was not scary. Were you asleep? Is it because it wasnt all blumhouse jump scares? It was mentally and visually terrifying. I saw it twice, the second time was to make sure my friends saw it too. Can't be traumatized alone... Well written, great performances, visuals amd affects were outstanding. I had trouble sleeping... Very similar to the witch where at first its slow, then it slaps you in the face with crazy imagery. Give it a chance, then sleep with the lights on",9,2,6,20 October 2018
