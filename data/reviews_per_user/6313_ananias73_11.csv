3:10 to Yuma," Good old-fashioned entertainment
","Remake of a 1957 film (Delmer Daves directed, with an excellent performance from Van Heflin as the rancher and Civil War veteran). Here Mangold give us a real good entertainment without the ambition to make something epic or glamorous (imagine Gibson or Costner directed this one with their 'wanna be De Mille style' to present us The Final Epic Tale of Old West!!). Great costumes designed from Arianne Phillips (especially those of Crowe and Foster), outstanding music score composed by Marco Beltrami (Academy Award nominee), a compelling plot, some riveting action scenes (especially the last one), and a pair of great performances from Russell Crowe as the amoral , famous outlaw Ben Wade and and Ben Foster as his loyal and psychopath buddy (he almost 'steals' every scene with his great costume, his crazy face expression, he reminds me Richard Widmark in Garden of Evil or Warren Oates in The Wild Bunch)",7,0,0,21 March 2010
Orphan," Female Damian manipulates
","Trying to forget that this film remains another version of an old 'formula' (psycho ' child' and a family in danger) and the stupidity of the main male character (even though it's obvious that something go wrong with this child from the beginning of the film), there is still a good effort from an unknown (to me) director with a nearly clever twist at the end and sub plots that focused on the characters and their reactions. An entertaining psychological (and horrible in a good way) thriller with an above-average believable performance from Farmiga as the adoptive mother (and very sexy too). P.S. I prefer the alternate ending",6,1,3,11 March 2010
Taxi Driver," 'Loneliness is following my whole life...'
","'Loneliness is following my whole life. In Cars, parks, sidewalks, everywhere. There is no escape. I'm God's Lonely Man...' Martin Scorsese gave us the most frightening landscape of the city through the eyes of a desperate man who wants to be someone. A great screenplay (by Paul Schrader) , the most chilling music score from Bernard Herrmann , a tour dew force from Robert De Niro (I think that was the most aggressive and silent performance of his career), this is the best American film in the 70's (with no doubt that was the most sincere and 'elegant' decade of the American Industry). A must to see (not to read about it) more than once to discover the insanity, the loneliness and the depression under the surface of the city 'till the extremely violent but not cathartic end.",10,0,1,1 October 2007
Shutter Island," descent to madness
","From this suspicious beginning of the film (Teddy & Chuck standing on a ferry on the way to the island) to the chilling end ('which would be worse, to live as a monster or to die as a good man?') this film remains a totally stunning experience. A scary descent (similar with those in Kafka's stories) to the catacombs of memory, insanity and loneliness, a lot of haunting dream sequences, a complex story of pain & tenderness (for the main character) which reminds me Parker's Angel Heart. Most of all another great film from Marti (incredible open sequence, a very frightening ferry's approach to the island). Admire also the consequence of the performers to the characters (even though what is obvious about them collapse at the end), especially Ruffalo and Kingsley (a near safe-bet to the next Academy Awards). Marti still directed films for the audience (and not for the critics or film buffs) and deserves our applause",9,1,4,9 March 2010
The Number 23," Morality against tension
","So, this starts with at least an interesting and promising basic idea, goes on and on with tension, Carey in a good untypical role but in a less than you expected performance, weak direction from Joel Schumacher match with some plot holes, the 'detective scenes' show us the luck of creativity. If you don't have great expectations (because of the negative reviews) maybe you will enjoy this . At the end they offer to us a lesson about morality (for those who remember 'Falling Down') and the 'Family Joy and Cure' that ruins every possibility to be kind and find the film watchable P.S. It's obvious who is the 'killer'! I wonder why W.Sparrow (Carey) didn't resolve the mystery from the beginning of the film...",3,1,3,30 October 2007
The Hurt Locker," A great character study from a great filmmaker
","The return of Bigelow (from her last film in 2002) is as a great political thriller as a skillfully created (and acted), emotional character study of a team of bomb experts in Iraq (film shootings in locations of Jordan), their daily 'face to death' activities disarming bombs, their concerns about the meaning of every war, their inability to rest peacefully when they return home as they can't understand any other world except this one they can handle. Intense and thrilling in every scene (what a great opening sequence!), the script (from Mark Boal) allows the characters to be judged from their actions, a star making performance from Oscar - nominated Jeremy Renner (also Anthony Mackie near to perfection, Bigelow, Boal and Renner all deserved Academy Awards, probably best film of this year",9,1,6,5 March 2010
Clash of the Titans," Clash of Nothing
","Why this film called 'Clash of the Titans' even though it has nothing to do with the Titans of Greek Mythology (and the word Titans mentioned only once in the whole movie?) How much did they paid to have Neeson with a ridiculous 'disco-ball' costume and his brutal voice as Zeus and Fiennes with his creeping face in the -supposed to be- evil role of Hades? Is Worthington an Avatar or he has already transformed to green-eye demi-God with clean face and marine hair-cut? This film is as bad as the original from Desmond Davis back in 1981 (to be honest the original looks very cheap these years and it has at least an interesting love story between Perseus and Adromeda). Here we have a group of brave and full of stupid courage men (not to mention the demon or something like that who support them) in their epic journey (they have scorpions as vehicles!) to kill snake-head Medusa and save the ancient city of Argos (and Andromeda too). The script lines (full of brave words) are laughable, the music score not even memorable, the costumes trashy, a whole movie , must to avoid. Only bright spots, Draco's figure mostly because he is more silent than the others, and a lovely performance from Pegasus",1,9,22,1 April 2010
Black Snake Moan," An odd blues film
","A weird story about a former blues man, now a farmer, in his mid-life (his wife left him for his brother!) and his faith's crisis who find a young nymphomaniac girl, abandoned nearby his farm, beaten and almost dead, bring her at his home and keep her chained to control her and fight against her sexual appetite. Very convincing performance from Jackson as Lazarus (maybe his finest among with these in Pulp Fiction and A time to Kill) and an impressive and mature from Ricci as Rae, once an abused child, now a fully emotional and immoral nympho. The whole script looks like a dark fairy tale (with happy ending even though this couldn't help the movie to get any success in theaters) about hope, faith and blues of course (incredible scene where Lazarus plays his guitar in a rainy, full of thunders night and his his 'personal' passport to find peace and faith hold tight his foot). Strange enough to find it great but overall an interesting experience",6,0,3,2 April 2010
Victory," Huston's worst, silliest movie
","A tolerable film only if you don't take it very seriously. Most of all the worst and meaningless film in John Huston career (it's a pity to have a great director in a silly and unrealistic script, it's obvious a bad choice before 'Under the Volcano' and 'The Prizzi's Honor'). During the Big Football Match between the evil and very, very mean Germans and the prisoners of the war the football players organize their escape from the camp. We have also Michael Caine in the worst mess he ever played and Sylvester Stallone with his 'monkey' accent as the goalkeeper in a Steve McQueen- type role in 'The Great Escape'. No script, no fun, not even a realistic plot (it's obvious! Germans organize football matches instead of taking care about the war in Europe). Have its spiritual moments because of Pele's presence...",2,5,11,28 October 2007
Mystic River," Clint's Masterpiece
","Three friends from the Irish neighborhood in Boston, one of them was abused when he was child, the other, an ex-convict, now the local mob whose daughter was kidnapped and murdered and the third one is the police officer who investigates the murder. Clint Eastwood's (at the age of 73!) darkest and most depressing film is a psychological character study, superbly directed, written and edited which focus on the community relationships and the way these persons lost ourselves. Sean Penn (Jimmy is a truly Shakespearean hero) and Tim Robbins (Dave, the child who was abducted and abused) won well-deserved academy awards for their performances but the unique cast (including Kevin Bacon as the third friend, Laura Linney as Jimmy's tough wife and Marcia Gay Harden as Dave' wife) is equally great. Best film from the American Film Industry for this decade ('till now...)",9,4,8,8 October 2007
The Mission," 'but now abideth faith, hope, love...these three. But the greatest of these is love'
","An emotionally journey in the South American villages of Brazil where Father Gabriel wants to bring Christianity to the natives and ex-slave hunter Mendoza to his mission in order to find peace for killing his brother. An inspiring, powerful movie about forgiveness, guilt, freedom of human will, redemption and most of all about love and how people are crucified for the protection of every human being. It is also a film with 'torn in different thoughts' heroes, torn between learned duties (as a priest for Mendoza) and his past, a conflict between catholic ideals and love as the only spirit and feeling who will live after all (a great final scene , a sunny and silent day in the jungle). 6 Academy Awards Nominations (including Best picture, Director for Joffe, a remarkable original music score from Morricone,for the incredible editing in the battle scene for Jim Clark etc) ,one win for the outrageous cinematography (once again) by Chris Menges, and a pair of -should be AAN- great performances from Irons and De Niro. A masterpiece",9,2,2,5 April 2010
