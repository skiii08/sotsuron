Ford v Ferrari," 7000 RPM, that's where everything fades!
","The best racing sport drama I've ever seen after 'Rush'. Car Maniac's will love this film. I know one or two about regular cars and I've no idea about racing cars but from zero to end, the film was exhilarating and i got to know how 24 hours le mans event goes. Christian Bale and Matt Damon's friendship in movie was funny yet beautiful! Even one liner jokes worked out very well. I specifically want to appreciate Sound Design crew and Director for this movie, boy what a feel they've given to this film! Watch it even if you don't know anything about racing cars, it's explained very detailed in the film.",10,4,9,16 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Marvellous
","What's with the hatred for this movie? I nearly believed the movie's quality was not good by negative rate bombers and fake reviewers(spoiler free ones)... They were actually wrong and i enjoyed the movie. Brie fitted the role for this. Samuel and Goose the cat moments worked out well(you'll know why after watching the film) and Ben(Talos) was really good(I won't spoil it). VFX team did a tremendous job for this film, it's balanced, just as Thanos says. The only drag i found was that the story was not up to the mark(atleast imo), like it was above okay-ish(say 70-80%) but other than that, it's totally worth the watch. Post credit scenes were lit. There's no surprise even if this review gets downvoted by many as i smell many haters for no reason, peace.",7,9,19,8 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disney made this into a joke
","First of all, this movie was neither perfect(10/10s) nor very worst(1/10s). The Last Jedi was very bad on the Star Wars Saga but The Rise of Skywalker was watchable. Because of Rian Johnson's ilogical story telling on TLJ, TRoS is facing heavy criticism.The visuals were great and fun to watch. Kylo Ren and Rey's plot was okay-ish(weird kissing scene just like Rose & Finn's on TLJ). Other than that, there's not much to it. So many characters were wasted. The story was too rushed, especially first 1 hour of the film. The ending felt like RotJ(Darth Vader turning to light side).The whole movie didn't disappoint me but it didn't satisfy me either, the feeling is like a wooden log is in the middle of the ocean,neither settles on the ocean bed nor comes up to the surface of the ocean.You'll either like it, hate it or feel nothing after watching the film.",5,68,179,21 December 2019
Avengers: Endgame," The endgame we deserve.
","I can't review it, cannot be described with words, experience it yourself on theatre guys! It's really THE ENDGAME! Whatever the expectations i had, it had gone even beyond that whatsoever!!! Just watch it without knowing any spoilers! 11 years of hardwork paid off, GG Marvel!",10,2,4,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," I'm not a toy! Ahhh!
","Eventhough this part wasn't necessary, the emotional happy ending to this film was fulfilling and amazing in my opinion. This is more than just the story of toys messing around. It's got every element to satisfy us and make us realise what life really is. I thought this movie would be like Toy Story 2 but i was wrong. Pixar again proved they are one of the best animation film makers! So long, partner.",8,2,5,21 June 2019
Aladdin," Don't believe the critics!
","Phenomenal movie! This is one of the best live action disney movies I've ever seen to be honest. What's wrong with the critics, bashing the movie for no reason? The movie was beautiful filled with joy, comedy, story, it got everything! Mena Massoud, Naomi scott and Will smith gave their best on this. Guy Ritchie made this movie possible, thanks to him. It's a Disney movie, so there will be more songs(it goes along with the story, you won't get bored). Watch with your family, you'll love it.",8,7,17,3 June 2019
Joker," Worth the hype!
","Joaquin Phoenix, what a performance, he really made us liking him. Felicitous for the Joker role! He lived as Joker, very empathetic one. Critics just like to whine about the movie that it's bad just to get attention for their sake. You know what? This movie is and will be one of the phenomenal movies of 2019. The message the movie tried to convey via cinematography at climax is an art, pure excellent art! The movie is so raw that it's actually disturbing to watch some scenes(Violence/Gore). This is how a dark movie should be made. One of the best movies to portray what a man/woman can go upto based on how society treats him/her. Just ignore the critics and watch the movie!",10,4,10,2 October 2019
It Chapter Two," We're losers and we always will be
","Many of them compared Chapter 1 with Chapter 2 but didn't realise they were all in one book. It's nearly 3 hours long but it's necessary as it's 1100+ pages novel, it wasn't even boring. Cast, screenplay, direction, cinematography, bg scoring were felicitous. Pennywise's performance was great. Many jumpscares were there, not just for name sake but it was along the storyline. Many bashed the movie just because critics did, trying to be intellectual. There were cons in the movie like very silly jokes on a serious shot(atmost 5 times), few poor choices of dialogues. Watch it if you're horror fan/have fun watching a movie.",7,16,29,7 September 2019
