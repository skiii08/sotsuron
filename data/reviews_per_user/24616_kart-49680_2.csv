Joker," Just average and boring.
","The making is just bad and pretty boring. Not sure in what dimension ppl think to like it. If you are capable to tolerate such a movie and still appreciate it (I would say you are blessed with a strong mind) , well, first go back home to tolerate and understand your loved ones heart on. This will improve our life and relationships for good.",5,2,14,15 November 2019
