10 Cloverfield Lane," Tense, and Unpredictable
","10 Cloverfield Lane had a few appealing features, but didn't seem as though it was poised to be as good as it was. Seeing the trailer the film looked odd, as it was a sequel to a found-footage disaster movie that was set in one location amongst only 3 characters. 10 Cloverfield Lane is tensely confining, well-written, and takes the franchise in a totally different direction. That being said this film could have been great if it had not been part of the cloverfield franchise, however it also did well within that universe.The film is very tense, similar to last year's Room, in that it's very confining and isolated. The film benefits from good performances all around, but most notably that of John Goodman who plays the sympathetic yet deranged Howard. Goodman's cold yet soft performance helps build tension as the character clearly controls the situation, but is unpredictable and often erratic. With a brilliantly dark and somewhat nightmarish tone, the film plays out like a human version of mice in a rigged maze.The story in the film is unpredictable and very well written, most likely due to the fact that 'Whiplash' writer and director Damien Chazelle co-wrote the script. The story unfolds with one twist after another, with each twist bigger than the last, until the film builds into its climax perfectly. Another element that was very well done was the character development, as each character is well-rounded, and given a good arc. With a good story and great characters 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well-written sequel to Cloverfield, that even improves upon its predecessor.One thing to note, while it may seem obvious, 10 Cloverfield Lane is very different from Cloverfield. Where Cloverfield was a found-footage disaster film with a huge scope, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a very confined traditionally shot thriller about people trapped in a bunker. That being said fans of the original may not be as fond of 10 Cloverfield Lane, whereas some who disliked Cloverfield may enjoy 10 Cloverfield Lane. However, they are very different films, with 10 Cloverfield Lane more focused on character development, and drama.In the end, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a well crafted thriller, that delivers, mostly due to great writing. The film is very tense, well-acted, well-written,unpredictable, and very different from its predecessor in size and scope. The end result is a great film that is in many ways better than the original Cloverfield, because of the effort and care of the people making it. For those that love tense thrillers, or just in general great films, this film will surely entertain.",8,2,4,18 March 2016
War Dogs," Somewhat Funny, but Riddled with Clichés
","War Dogs seems like a film with a ton of potential, because of the people involved in it, but lacks the spark to make it anything other than okay. The problem seems to be that the crew wanted to tell a true story and make the audience laugh but didn't fully understand, given the source material, how to do that. War Dogs is intermittently funny, but relies too much on clichés, and fails to pack any kind of a punch. If you're trying to figure out what kind of a movie this is, picture The Big Short with a slightly lesser known crew.War Dogs did have a lot going for it, namely the talents of Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, as well as the direction of Todd Phillips (The Hangover Trilogy.) Above that the trailers for this film looked fairly funny, but note that almost all of the genuinely funny parts of the movie are contained in the trailer. That being said the film often tries to take a more dramatic approach, and fails to ever generate a hilarious moment. That being said both Miles Teller and Jonah Hill's performances are great in this film.While Teller and Hill are great in this film it really feels too familiar, as if you've seen it before. That shouldn't be the case with a film about two men in their twenties running guns in the Iraq War. That being said it ends up making it's characters into clichés, and tells an overdone storyline about rags to riches idiots, and betrayal of best friends. It really is a shame because, as I mentioned before, this film could've been very original and interesting, but ends up being like most other films of today, more recycled than anything else.Above that the film fails, at what it ultimately wants to do, which is pack a punch. It seems self evident watching it, that the director and writers wanted to expose a scary problem in America, and at the same time generate a few laughs. In that sense it's a lot like The Big Short, however War Dogs fails to ever do what it strives to do. Where The Big Short was informational, funny, and in the end terrifyingly honest, War Dogs is not. This movie may have a moment or two, but seems to miss it's intended mark on both ends, in that it's not as funny as it'd like to be nor is it as damning. In the end War Dogs feels like more of an average film, which is disappointing because it had the potential to do everything wanted to. If you expect a great comedy, it's not really that, if you're expecting a great look at true and terrifying events that led to two young immature men running guns for America, it's not really that either. War Dogs is funny, well acted, and has a story to tell, but relies on clichés, stereotypes, and doesn't offer very much thought provoking material. This is a good film if you want a few chuckles but it doesn't supply a ton of laughs.",6,7,13,23 August 2016
Citizen Kane," A Beautiful Portrait of a Tragic Character
","Citizen Kane has often been considered one of the best films ever made, and for good reason. The film uses complex and expert composition, camera work, and pioneered new techniques like deep focus, and elaborate camera movements. However, the most impressive part of Citizen Kane is the subtle meanings that can be taken from the composition, if viewed closely enough, it can drastically change a viewer's opinion of the characters. All the while using the life of William Randolph Hearst as a blueprint for the character and story.When discussing Citizen Kane there's a lot to talk about, some of which is more obvious than the rest. One compositional trick the film used was the use of low angle camera frames. This meaning the camera was below Kane quite often to imply power, this often helped reinforce that Kane was a man of great power. The use of camera angles did help reinforce that Kane was a man of power, but was most likely used more for leading audiences to show the duality of the character. Another obvious aspect is that of Deep Focus, and elaborate camera movements, both of which were groundbreaking at the time of release. Citizen Kane's most impressive achievement was that of Deep Focus, a method in which everything in the foreground and background is clearly in focus. Deep Focus was used effectively to show that Kane was important even in frames when he was seemingly trapped. Despite the fact that Kane was a powerful man he's consistently shown as being trapped, helping reinforce the duality of the character.Charles Foster Kane is besides his superficial facade a very tragic character, but it may take a few viewings to realize this. In multiple cases throughout the film composition implies a further meaning, most often the composition is made to make Kane look trapped. The two best examples of this are in the beginning with his parents, and at the midpoint of the film, when Kane is in Susan Alexander's room with Boss Gettys. An understandable question is why Kane shown as being trapped?The answer is given in the beginning, and throughout until the end 'Rosebud.' Rosebud has it's literal meaning, and the figurative meaning of a lost childhood. However, the film consistently shows the audience that Rosebud represents that Kane is a lonely character, looking for a love he was deprived of before he had a say in the matter. Multiple lines in the film reinforce this for instance when Kane says 'A toast, Jedediah: to Love on my own terms. That's the only terms I've ever known.' It would seem logical that Susan Alexander paralleled Rosebud, as their affair, is the only time Kane doesn't look lonely. Rosebud being Kane's lost innocence, and love, may have been filled by Susan Alexander, the best evidence of this is that Kane admits he's looking for Rosebud before he meets her, but is distracted by her, symbolizing that she represents the same thing Kane that Rosebud does. In the end however, Kane loses Rosebud again, and he loses Alexander as well. It's impossible to ignore the tragic look of an old lonely Kane who sits in an empty Xanadu, probably wishing he could give it all up for another life, one where he had Rosebud. Rosebud is also theorized to be a reference towards William Randolph Hearst. Film reviewer Gore Vidal theorized that Rosebud was Hearst's nickname for a private region of his mistress Marion Davies, other theories were that it was Hearst's nickname for his childhood bike, either way it seemed to connect to Hearst. It seems obvious that Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life despite what Welles said. The evidence is that Xanadu is remarkably similar to Hearst Castle, both characters were media moguls who helped start wars, and both had mistresses.Regardless of whether or not Citizen Kane is based on Hearst's life it is still a great film full of meanings. It is so full of meanings, and elaborate compositions it's almost impossible to address all of them, but that's only a testament to the film's sheer quality. At the time the film changed the way filmmakers approached framing, and movement. It seems that still today few films have been so dense with literal, compositional, and figurative meanings as Citizen Kane did. It will forever remain a masterpiece of American Cinema.",9,3,4,8 October 2015
Zootopia," A Great Reflection of Today's Society
","With Pixar being owned by Disney, there seems to have been a nice amount of bleed over between the two, Pixar is more consistent with the quality of their films, but every once and awhile a movie of Pixar's quality comes from Disney. We should remember that Disney was once, and in many ways still is the premiere animation company, but not that long ago they had been struggling to put out great films. Zootopia is smart, funny, and is mature in its storytelling and in its message. It's very nice to see a movie directed at kids that has respect and treats kids as people who can understand complex themes, not mindless creatures that need simple clichéd messages.In that respect Zootopia is more like a Pixar film, where Pixar has shown an understanding that complex messages can be the most emotionally powerful and while being complex can be presented in a simple, and straightforward way. Much like Inside Out taught us so much about using our emotions, especially sadness, Zootopia has a great message about fear and the treatment of entire groups of people because of that fear. It's ironic, because the movie indirectly latches onto an issue that is relevant today, with an air of innocence and purity. On top of that at a deeper level, the film is witty, in that everything ties together and that the audience is forced to think as the movie progresses.The humor is witty as well, in particular the scene about the DMV which is so funny because it's spot on. The witty humor and complex messages make this film enjoyable for everybody, not just kids. Every character in the film is given a great amount of thought and development, making it so that they all have moments to grow, and are extremely relatable. Unfortunately the film's villain has good motivations, however at the end when they reveal who the villain is they come across as campy and over the top.The movie does a great job creating an inventive world where animals from all different habitats can coexist in one city. The film then proceeds to partially waste it's inventive world on various scenes that are plucked straight out of other films, namely the Godfather. However, those scenes are only a small takeaway from the movie as a whole, because they don't last very long and are admittedly clever. That along with the overall maturity the screenwriters used still makes the film a great accomplishment.Zootopia never really looked like a film that would be this good, but after seeing the amazing amount of craft and effort, it seems this may be one of the better animated films of the year. The film does what every animated film should do, it tells a solid story with a lot of emotional depth, and a message that can hopefully teach kids important lessons. The film is also funny, smart, beautifully animated, filled with great characters, and features great voice work. If you have kids, and they haven't seen this film yet, it's safe to say they'd enjoy it, but they may possibly take an important life lesson away from seeing it to.",9,9,19,21 March 2016
Creed," An Exhilarating Showcase of Talent and Heart.
","Ryan Coogler's Creed delivers on everything that a great boxing film should, and represents a full return to form for Rocky. Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.From the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is 'a fighter.' The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.One reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing 'Creed' and 'Fruitvale Station' I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.Some may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. The way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it's a terrific 2 hours to spend.",9,151,223,25 November 2015
Spotlight," A Scary Story, Because it's True.
","This is easily one of the best live action films of 2015. At the end of the year this movie will likely get a lot of Oscar attention, and it truly deserves it. Spotlight holds nothing back, features an ensemble of amazing performances, and tells a haunting true story. This story is recent enough that many people probably still remember, but old enough that many people will probably find it educational.Perhaps the film's greatest strength is it's story, which is incredibly dense with information. Not to spoil the film, but to give context the film is about a large scandal involving the Boston Catholic Priests in 2001. The story is so dense that it would have been easy to hold back information or gloss over plot elements, but somehow the filmmakers behind this film were able to fit it all into the film, in just over 2 hours. The film is unapologetically real, despite the occasional moments of theatricality, which all films have.The entire cast is magnificent in this film, lead by Mark Ruffalo and Michael Keaton. Both of which will probably receive Oscar nominations for back-to-back years. In a film that relies on a slow-burn approach, with a more emotional grip on the audience, the acting was paramount, and the entire cast delivered. It's most impressive, because they are able to every moment and make it feel important through their portrayals. These performances also help to make the characters feel more real, and relatable.The performances support one other major strength of the film, which is the haunting tone of the film. The film is scary in an very real way, as the film showcases that even in large hubs with millions of people, massive secrets can be hidden. At a time with drones, and widespread public mistrust it makes the film even scarier. It's the haunting story and tone that helps elevate the acting, to form a truly great film.In the end the film tells a relevant story that every American should know, without compromising its source material. Spotlight is a film so good that even the churches it condemned had to admit that it was great. The film will likely receive a lot of award recognition, and rightfully so, as it stands as one of the best movies of 2015. It's a haunting film that tells a story so compelling and unbelievable it becomes a must see film.",9,2,4,28 November 2015
Concussion," A Well-Acted, But A Little Generic Sports Drama
","In the last few years, awareness about the problems retired football players are facing has risen. Just a few years ago a large group of retired football players sued the NFL because they all had concussion-related issues, Concussion is about the beginning of that. Concussion is well acted, tells a well-timed story, albeit it being a little generic. The best thing about this movie is Will Smith, especially his performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu. Will Smith anchors the film as Forensic Pathologist Bennet Omalu, and he flourishes in the role, even handling Omalu's accent pretty well. The film features a talented ensemble including Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks, and Gugu Mbatha Raw. The entire ensemble is great, even the actors only appearing for short periods, despite some weak characters. Perhaps the only caveat is that Smith and Raw's romance feels more awkward than romantic at times, but it seems that was intentional.The film also does very well portraying a timely story, that will undoubtedly be relevant for years to come. The film brilliantly shows the story of one man against one of the biggest corporations in America and the cover-up of a major issue. That is not an overly original storytelling method, but the film definitely portrays the NFL as an 'evil' organization. Much like Spotlight earlier this year, the film shows the scary true story of how when an organization gets too much power it can cover up terrible truths.The film does have some problems, namely, that is somewhat generic and slow. Concussion follows the sports drama formula and struggles pushing the story along. While the film is only 2 hours, it feels more like 2 and a half hours. Because the film tells a story that is still unfolding, it's ending is a little anti-climactic. On top of that, the dialogue in the film isn't very good, and the film has next to no humor.Concussion is a very entertaining sports drama featuring a great performance from Will Smith. The film's story is interesting, because of it's modern appeal, as well as the fact that it pulls no punches, and ambitiously accuses one of the most powerful corporations in America. However, the film struggles it feels long, is a little generic, and limps to the end. In the end, sports fans will more than likely enjoy the film, but beware the film has a lot of football criticisms littered through it.",6,1,5,3 January 2016
The Hateful Eight," A Funny, Gory, Beautifully Shot Western
","Quentin Tarantino, whether you like his films or not, deserves credit as one of the best directors of our age, because his films are so consistently great. Tarantino's 'Hateful 8' should be experienced as he intended, in 70mm film showings, because average theaters can't quite do the film justice. The Hateful 8 is blood covered fun, with a story that is surprisingly unpredictable, and features truly beautiful cinematography. A note for anybody not aware, Tarantino's films are extremely gory and feature strong language, so if you don't like that kind of subject matter, this film isn't for you.Tarantino's is notorious for his use of gore and language, but he always finds a way to make it fun. The Hateful 8 is no exception as the film is both extremely gory, and often hilarious. One of the biggest reasons the film is so funny is Tarantino's iconic, and witty dialogue. It is widely discussed that Tarantino is one of the best writers of dialogue and 'The Hateful 8' is a great showcase of that. Before seeing the film, I was curious, because the film was advertised as a story of 8 people trapped in a cottage during a blizzard, while that is a part of the story, it is far larger than that. The best example is that entering the film Channing Tatum was confirmed to be in the film, and it seemed unclear what role he could have, however he has a pretty significant role in the film. In many ways the plot unfolds like a game of clue, and the story is unpredictable in what turns the plot will take next. The unpredictable plot helps save the almost 3 hour running time, which is a little too long.An example of why the run time is just a little too long, is a lot of the film focuses on the cinematography, which is why the 70mm film showings are truly worth the time to see. Most of the film is set in the gorgeous snow covered mountains of Wyoming, and the use of 70mm film gives the entire film a sleek and classical look. While the film could have been tightened up a little, if there wasn't such a focus on the cinematography, the film would lose a little of the spectacle that makes it so special.In the end The Hateful 8 is a spectacle, that should be experienced the way it was intended to, in a 70mm film showing. The film is beautiful, funny, unpredictable, and extremely violent, but it all blends in a very clean way. Tarantino has once again made a great film, and considering his resume, it seems logical to say that he is one of the best modern directors. If you like Tarantino's previous films, or films similar to Tarantino's it would be a good idea to check out The Hateful 8.",9,16,47,30 December 2015
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A Hilarious, Biting Satire of the Cold War
","Out of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading 'Peace is our Profession', or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film 'Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room.' All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it's time.",9,2,3,22 October 2015
Black Mass," A Chilling Mob Biopic
","Black Mass is a completely enthralling biopic about one of the most violent mobsters in Boston history, but even more impressively represents a return to form for Johnny Depp. This film hinges on Depp's performance, if he's not good the film would come across as slow, but even when the film slows down Depp's chilling performance as Whitey Bulger keeps you interested. The film had to compete with the fact that the man James 'Whitey' Bulger was a heavy inspiration for Frank Costello in Martin Scorsese's 'The Departed', however the film did a good job looking at the character in a different angle. Many of the other characters lack development, and the story wears thin at times, but for the most part the film is well constructed, and even better executed. Depps performance, the beautiful cinematography, dark humor, and the perfectly dark tone make Black Mass a really solid Mob drama.",8,1,13,18 September 2015
Suicide Squad," A Talented Cast Trapped in a Rushed, Crowded Mess
","Suicide Squad, the next entry in the ever bleak DC Cinematic Universe, is here and frankly I was disappointed. The hype for this film was big and expectations may have been admittedly very high, but this film fails on a level deeper than just a bad movie where a good movie was expected. Suicide Squad features a great cast, but falls flat in terms of story, and rushes through its already thin story. What's so sad is that the formula for a really good movie was there and the filmmakers ignored it completely.With a film that has so many talented stars in it, and Jai Courtney, it's not surprising that the expectations were very high for the film. Will Smith is not immune to bad decisions when it comes to his films, but he's pretty good at rising above them and making films better all on his own. Jared Leto is pretty great in this film, he'll undoubtedly be judged by comparisons to other Joker performances, but just on his own merit he was great. The entire cast did a good job, Smith, Leto, Viola Davis, and Margot Robbie were all excellent in their performances, but they were failed by a poorly crafted film.The biggest problem is the fact that the screenwriter and director seemed to not be on the same page, when it came to what this film was about, or more precisely who this film is about. To me, it's about Rick Flag and the Enchantress. However, clearly somebody in the process missed that and felt that every character needed an appropriate amount of backstory, which they don't. The result of this confusion is two cardinal sins, the first is that the audience is given a lot of needless scenes of backstory that we don't need that waters down the story. The second and far more egregious is that the better story was very clearly sitting within this watered down, and crowded mess that we ended up with.Without spoilers this film rushes through introducing all of it's characters and giving backstory, for almost every one of them. Frankly there are more subtle and effective ways to show us something than 5 minute flashbacks for every character. Above that we can't care about the characters, besides Amanda Waller who you will grow to hate because Viola Davis gave an amazing performance, which really hurts the film because they were on to something. The painful thing is that if the filmmakers had looked at what they had, they may have noticed that certain alternative plot points would have been far more emotionally impactful, and they just missed them.It's easy to see how some will enjoy this film, it's not boring, or unenjoyable. This film just suffers from the same problem that Batman v. Superman did, the better film rests within the mess we were given. In the end Suicide Squad is rushed, crowded, features a weak villain, and feels like a poor man's Guardians of the Galaxy. That being said kids may enjoy this film and comic book die hards like will too, simply for the spectacle.",5,1,3,5 August 2016
Doctor Strange," Funny, Action-Packed, and Mind-Bendingly Creative
","Doctor Strange, Marvel Studios newest entry in the marvel cinematic universe, is here and it is really good. Doctor Strange may not be as well-rounded as this year's Civil War, or some of the other Marvel gems, but it is a really good film on it's own merit. Doctor Strange features mind bending visuals, entertaining thrills, and a fresh look at the Marvel cinematic universe (MCU). Doctor Strange is yet another strong entry in the ever impressive MCU, which makes it harder and harder to argue, that Marvel is the premiere film studio today.This movie described simply is like watching the avengers while on acid, and the special effects are perfect. In this film the characters dance between many different realities, and essentially within these realities everything can be manipulated by the mind. The special effects are amazing in this film, which is a true compliment, because many films this year struggled with overly digitized special effects. In this film, it's obvious that there are special effects, but they look very realistic.The acting in this film is very good, as Benedict Cumberbatch brings his usual intense personality into his character. The action sequences are very well shot, and the film is subtly very funny. It's admirable that Marvel refuses to step away from humor, because it's become their true signature. One weak point about this film was that some of the characters were very flat, the villain especially so. Unfortunately, Mads Mikkelsen gives a great performance, but his character is yet another generic evil character, consumed by a bigger evil force, with little development as to why. That being said this film wasn't all that original, but it didn't feel recycled either. This is most likely because this film introduced viewers to the more cosmic side of the MCU. Much like Guardians of the Galaxy took viewers off earth, this film takes viewers out of normal reality. It's impressive that Marvel can have so many characters in so many different atmospheres. In the end this film is yet another solid Marvel film. It's not the best marvel film ever, but it's a very entertaining, funny, well-acted, and creative film that is perfect for viewers of all ages. The film struggled a little with a clichéd villain, some marvel clichés, and the occasional overly- expository dialogue. For those with children this film is perfect for them, and for those who love action or comic book film, give this film a look.",8,2,4,12 November 2016
Ant-Man," Funny, but A Little Generic
","Ant-Man is funny, nice to look at, but a little too clichéd at times. As per usual Marvel Studios has put out a film, that is funny, especially with the comedic chops of it's lead actor. The film boasts a talented cast, including the very talented Michael Douglas, and most of the cast members deliver, especially the very talented Michael Douglas. The special effects are good, but that's no surprise, but a big surprise was that most of the characters had good development, and while the villain wasn't a great villain he was serviceable. All in all the Ant-Man is led by good acting, a good story, albeit a little clichéd, and a good sense of humor. While Ant-Man isn't Marvel's best it's still quite entertaining.",8,6,17,16 July 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," A Little Formulaic, But Admittedly Funny.
","Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping never looked all that appealing to me, but I must say it was surprisingly better than I expected. Seeing the trailers I thought the film was another in a wave of ultra dumb comedies, but up front, it's really not. Popstar is a little formulaic, but is admittedly funny, and finds a way to even be witty. Even more impressive, although not all that surprising is that some of the songs in this movie are actually pretty catchy, albeit mock-ups.For those who love This is Spinal Tap and other films of that nature, this film is a little derivative. That being said, it's not as if this is just a rehash of other better films, that entire genre does require modernizations every few years. Because this film is spoofing not only the musicians of today, but everybody in the entertainment world. That being said this film does list as another Judd Apatow film and does have some formulaic moments that appear in all of his films.The most notable 'Appatowism' in this film is the overdone comedy trope of today, where the film lingers on jokes far longer than they should, under the illusion that lingering over a joke makes it funnier. It's kinda like when a goofy kid makes a great joke everybody laughs, and then the kid gets confident and keeps pushing the joke until everybody around is just wishing he'd shut up and go away. That being said, the film doesn't live off the annoying lingering joke, and succeeds at being genuinely funny, all the time. It's not the funniest movie this year, and it may not even be hilarious, but the film is consistently littered with raunchy funny jokes, that often deliver.The film was marketed poorly, in my opinion, because it came across as an ultra dumb comedy, and in reality isn't half as dumb as it comes across as. The film occasionally wanders into the dumb comedy area, but often finds it's way back into the land of witty comedies, making it somewhat of a mixed bag. For instance, the songs are catchy, they are witty reflections of our pop stars, but they are also a little too on the nose, making them come across as a little dumb. That being said, underneath the thin exterior of a dumb comedy is a really witty reflection of our current music industry, and the pressures, idiocracy, immaturity, selfishness, and chaos commonly associated with it.Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping is filled with cameos from famous musicians and comedy actors, some of which even lend their singing talents to the musical pieces. At times it feels like the entire music industry is in this film, as they play along on a mockumentary making fun of them. However, the film is never really mean spirited, or all that damning it just grooves along, spoofing everybody from the musicians to the fans. For those who like the lonely island, you'll love this movie, and for those who are seeking a funny comedy, regardless of rating this is also a movie you'll love, but there should be a note, this movie really isn't for kids or the weak spined.",8,29,43,8 June 2016
The Revenant," A Non-Traditional Western
","The Revenant isn't like most westerns that have very straightforward moral dilemmas and are fun tones, it is dark, and it is complicated. The Revenant is a movie with a lot of backstories that makes, it even more impressive than it already is, and it is impressive. The Revenant is brilliantly acted, features beautiful cinematography all the while showing deep narrative heft. The film is poised to receive major awards attention, and rightfully so.The first piece of back story surrounding this film is fairly well known, and that is that Leonardo DiCaprio is still fighting for his first Oscar. After seeing this film, it seems safe to say that his performance is Oscar worthy. DiCaprio carries the movie as long stretches of the film feature DiCaprio alone, acting in an isolated surrounding, which is even harder to do. DiCaprio often balances soft-hearted empathy and stone-cold revenge within small stretches, and every emotion is well accentuated. While the focus is on DiCaprio, because he's the cornerstone of the film, Tom Hardy and Domhall Gleeson are also brilliant in this film as well.Another piece of back story that may not be as well known is that Director Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu and Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki decided to shoot the entire film with nothing but natural light. To go a little deeper, considering exposure and reciprocity this gave the filmmakers only a few hours to shoot per day in order to get a good exposure. Even more impressive is that the film is stunningly gorgeous, and by that I mean that the film looks professionally lit, despite the use of no lighting. This is Lubezki's third consecutive cinematography masterpiece, and he'll probably end up winning his third consecutive Oscar for cinematography.The other impressive aspect of the film is the story. Most westerns tell straightforward stories, with simple characters (good guy vs. bad guy), that's not bad it's just easier to follow. The Revenant mixes traditional western conventions such as the use sweeping panoramic vistas, and the typical setting, but has far more complicated and deeper characters. All of the characters in this film are relatable because their motivations are easy to follow, just not always pleasant. The end result of the realistic character development is that the story is far more realistic and thus thought provoking.In conclusion, The Revenant is brilliantly acted, and may be the film to finally get Leonardo DiCaprio his much awaited Oscar win. The film is beautifully shot and will, more than likely, win the Best Cinematography Oscar. The story is uncompromising, and graphic when it needs to be. For those who love artistic films, this is right up your alley, and for those who love westerns, you'll probably enjoy it too.",9,3,8,8 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," A Well-Acted Cold War Thriller
","Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.",9,63,108,18 October 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A Great Spy Action Flick
","Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation Is a funny, action packed, and just in general good spy action flick. The film features terrific action sequences, made all the better by Tom Cruise's devotion to doing his own stunts. In particular the motorcycle chase is my favorite single action sequence of this year. The film takes some liberties, and has a few inventions that don't seem technologically possible, but at the st seems as though Mission Impossible has become the Fast and Furious of spy films, where it may not be the most realistic, but it remains aware, and constantly tries to up itself. As well the film has a few too many clichés, and has a somewhat weak villain, but due to it's engrossing plot, great action, sense of humor, and it's nearly non-stop pacing these flaws are in general forgivable.",9,2,5,31 July 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Funny, Smart, and Great Character Development
","Captain America: Civil War is in my opinion the best Marvel Studios film to date, I do not say that lightly. I loved Captain America: The Winter Soldier and The Avengers, but Civil War does everything that Marvel has needed to do for a while. Civil War is perfectly written, crafted with care and heart, and feature brilliant character development. All things considered Civil War is a feat, because it finally shows that Marvel is willing to take some risks, all the while remaining true to what has made their films so enjoyable.When looking at Civil War, in specific the story, it's almost perfect. The story serves as a culmination of all the events that have occurred in the ever expanding marvel cinematic universe. The great thing about this film is it's the first comic book film to intelligently address the issue of how do people respond to the seemingly endless carnage created by the main characters. Such a simple idea is perfectly applied create a thought provoking movie where every action has a repercussion.The brilliance of this film can't be understated, because the politics within the film are fictional, but feel realistic, and are dominated by shades of grey. The film finds a way to be more brave than any of the previous marvel films by taking risks and attacking deep issues, but keeps the iconic sense of humor marvel has become known for. It should be noted that the film's not dark or anything, but it does attack complex themes, and conveys a surprising amount of emotional depth for a summer blockbuster. When you consider the density of the story and the amount of characters featured it's amazing that the film worked as well as it did.That brings me to what I consider the most impressive element of the entire film, the character development. It's difficult to have a film with as many characters as this film has, and make every character feel well developed, but this film does that, more so it makes you feel for characters who are brawling with each other. The acting was one reason the characters feel so well developed as the actors brought small nuances that sold the characters that much more, and while Chris Evans is great in this film the real superstar is Robert Downey Jr., who brings so many emotions to his performance in this film. This is in my opinion the best portrayal of Iron Man since his original film, but the irony is that the show stealer is Spider-Man who marvel nailed.For those who enjoy films that are funny, touching, action-packed, or just good stories this film won't disappoint. This film is what Batman v. Superman should have been, however is even more impressive because the film finds a way to juggle so many different tasks, and does it well. Captain America: Civil War is one of those great films that everybody can watch and enjoy for different reasons. If you like movies of this genre, check Civil War out because it's one of the best in recent memory.",9,9,19,5 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," A Genuinely Scary Sequel
","The Conjuring 2 is one of those extremely rare horror sequels that doesn't fall victim to copying it's predecessor. While The Conjuring 2 isn't free of clichés and isn't better than it's predecessor, it's a really solid horror film separate from the original. The Conjuring 2 is chilling without relying on jump scares, features really good character development, despite being a tad familiar. This film may prove that James Wan is the modern king of horror, because every horror film he does is solid.One thing to learn from this film is that while jump scares are a cheap way to get scares, they can be very effective when used sparingly. Many modern horror films rely solely on jump scares to scare the audience, but this film has a truly chilling tone, and many scenes are terrifying without jumping the audience. That being said there are jump scares littered throughout this film, but Wan is clever when he uses them, and is often effective when he uses them. I'm proud that most horror films don't jump me, that being said multiple times watching this film I found myself jumped.One major reason this film succeeds is because of the character development, which really helps the audience care about the characters. Every single character in the film is well fleshed out, and given a moment of relatability. Even the ghosts in the film are generally scary and have a really good design. However, the film's characters represent one of the film's major problems, the fact that it's based on true events. After seeing this film it would seem to say that the phrase 'based on true events' was only included for dramatic effect.The story of the film is based on the actual events of the Enfield Poltergeist in England in the late 70's but the problem is that half the film uses moments from that investigation and the other half feels like an exorcist rip off. It's unfortunate because there's a terrifying story, despite the evidence that it was a hoax, in the Enfield Poltergeist that gets lost in the shuffle. Simply put if the filmmakers hadn't felt the need to match The Exorcist, the film's ending may not have felt so different from the rest of the film.In the end for horror buffs, this may be the best horror film of the year, if nothing better comes along. For those who want to see a great horror film regardless of its faithfulness to the actual events this is a great film, but for those who want a faithful adaptation of the Enfield Poltergeist this film definitely takes some liberties. That being said this film is genuinely scary which is rare today, and above that is just a good film in general, so it's most definitely worth seeing.",8,1,4,19 June 2016
Inside Out," Funny and Touching.
","Inside Out is a funny, heartwarming, and deep journey into the human mind. Pixar has a filmography that's hard to match, and things will remain that way if they keep putting out films of this caliber. As per usual the story is well crafted, and inventive, but the most impressive thing is the use of humor to help the moments of true drama. By that I mean the film has a relatable humor, that anybody can laugh at and have a good time with, so when the film decides to get serious it hits the audience even deeper. This something Pixar's always been good at, but this movie has some of the most touching moments since Up. On top of the brilliant use of humor, the visuals are stunning, the voice acting is perfect, and the characters are surprisingly well crafted. In the end Inside Out is one of Pixar's best films in the last 5 years, and is worth seeing on the big screen.",10,5,28,19 June 2015
Lawrence of Arabia," One of the Best Epics of All-Time
","Lawrence of Arabia is a classicist Epic directed by David Lean, and starring Peter O'Toole as the titular character T.E. Lawrence. In many ways Lawrence of Arabia exemplifies an Epic, but what may be most impressive about the film is it's use of character development and themes. Lawrence of Arabia may be the best epic of all time, because it is grand in scope, long but never boring, and beautiful to look at. It truly is a masterpiece.When one thinks of what defines an epic, they could point to Lawrence of Arabia as a perfect example, it literally sets the standard. For example Lawrence of Arabia contains many Extreme Wide Shots of a vast panoramic landscape, this is one of the most recognizable elements of a epic, reinforcing how large in scope the story is. Most epics deal with stories that have a sense of spectacle, and therefore use these huge landscapes to show that, Lawrence of Arabia does that as well as any other film.Set against the Arabic dessert, which lends itself to large panoramic landscape shots, the audience is treated to seeing a beautiful picture, and in the middle we see these characters trying to navigate their way through it all. The film liked to use mostly wide shots, so much so that when they use a close up, it truly feels like it has meaning. On top of that Lawrence of Arabia contains some of the most luxurious set designs, and costumes of the time. High production values is of course is another common element of an epic, but the most impressive thing about Lawrence of Arabia is the pacing and the character development.At almost four hours it's hard to imagine a film that wouldn't feel long, but somehow Lawrence of Arabia manages not to. This is most likely because the themes and characters are both relatable, but also larger than life in some ways. Seeing a normal man navigate his way through massive desserts, and through foreign cultures may make him seem larger than life, but to his core the film keeps Lawrence human, so the audience never feels detached from him.The film deals with age old themes such as the 'fish out of water' theme, which is used quite often, but arguably never better than in this film. As with most of the best films, the story and character development is mostly visual. In the beginning we quickly see how out of place Lawrence is, as we see his Arab escort shot for stealing water, Lawrence is outraged, as to him killing is taboo, and water is a common commodity, yet to the Arab culture, Water is so precious it's worth killing for. As the film goes on Lawrence learns the cultural difference, and learns not to treat other cultures as barbaric, because to them he is the barbarian.Utilizing beautiful grandeur Lawrence of Arabia still stands as one of, the best epics of all time, and a true masterpiece of cinema. Embodying all of the characteristics of a classic epic film Lawrence of Arabia is truly impressive because of it's masterful pacing and character development. It truly is an epic experience.",10,2,5,22 October 2015
It Follows," Terrifying to the Bone.
","This film is like if slender man were an STD, and it's terrifying. The reason I bring that up is many people, myself included, have been calling for a slender man film. The music helps feed the tone, and it feels like a true homage to 80's horror films (the best time for horror, no doubt.) The film has a way of always making you feel uneasy right up to the final scene, as the villain could be anybody who's walking at an average speed. This leads to everybody being a potential candidate for this creatures form. Despite undeveloped characters and a slight lack of humor the film completely delivers. Hopefully filmmakers use this and the Babadook to save the genre.",9,49,97,6 May 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Disappointing from Script to Special Effects
","X-Men: Apocalypse, the follow up to X-Men: Days of Future Past, is finally here, and frankly i'm disappointed. The film suffers from a plethora of problems, and struggles to limp through which is shocking considering how great Days of Future Past was. X-Men: Apocalypse is entertaining, but suffers from terrible special effects and post production, and a very weak villain. The most sad thing about this film is that it had so much potential to be great, and just took a long walk off a short pier.The biggest advantage this film has going for it is it's super talented cast, who show up and give it their all, despite a weak script. Lawrence, McAvoy, and Fassbender all make this film as entertaining as they can, and the action sequences are fun to watch. However, the script has serious problems, many of which are too hard to overcome. Put frankly the story isn't well crafted at all, it's choppily thrown together more resembling a set of disconnected scenes following each other not a story.The film's biggest crux is it's special effects and post production. This may sound odd, but they are, in some cases, so bad that they are distracting. The dialogue is one major problem, as clearly there was a lot of ADR (Automatic Dialogue Replacement) or dubbing, and it often doesn't match the lips or doesn't sound like the actor has the rest of the movie. Above that the special effects, whether practical or digital, looks bad. The CGI isn't very good, the sets are noticeable and flat, Apocalypse's makeup is obvious, not very good, and distracting.On that note Apocalypse, the titular character is one of the movie's biggest weaknesses. Noted as one of the comic's coolest villains with an unflinching belief in darwinism, the film's villain more represents a shell of that. Oscar Isaac isn't the problem, as he gives the performance his best effort, but the character has weak motivations at best, and isn't all that menacing or memorable. A product of a lazily crafted script where the character that binds it all together has no real dimensions and is essentially a flat shell of a cooler idea.It's ironic that Fox spent almost 200 million making Apocalypse, and spent just under 60 million on Deadpool, a far superior film. The best way to describe X-Men: Apocalypse is a mixed bag, because it's not a terrible movie, but it's not a very good movie either, it's just mediocre. The film is obviously the product of a poorly crafted script, which is a shame, because it could have, and thus should have, been better.",5,4,11,27 May 2016
Ex Machina," Great Acting, but a Little Familiar
","Ex Machina is a really good and extremely smart Sci-Fi drama. The performances given by Alicia Vikander and Oscar Issac are great, and the film makes you feel as if the relationship between man and machine is more real than most romances between real people. I loved seeing the robot and man relationship, and at first the film makes the audience feel for the machine. However, as the film progresses it sways more to the thought provoking and complex themes, which then make some of the machines feel less relatable, and more familiar with today's modern clichÃ©s. Also the film lacks a sense of humor, and feels a little too much like Frankenstein meets Her.",8,2,6,6 May 2015
Jurassic World," Very Entertaining, and Surprisingly Fun
","Jurassic World is an entertaining time at the theaters, that uses a surprising amount of humor and depth to keep you interested. While Jurassic World is not as good as the original, not even close, it is a good movie in it's own right. As to be expected the plot wasn't very original, but take that with the grain of salt that going in you don't expect too much originality. That being said while not very original, the stakes in this film are higher than in the original, as the first film dealt with 15 or so people on the island, this movie deals with thousands. In the end I found the plot to have enough twists to keep me interested, the movie had a surprising amount of humor (including a hilarious Jimmy Fallon cameo), and an awesome climax.",8,12,28,12 June 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Not as good as The Avengers, but still great.
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is fast paced, funny, and is filled with awesome action sequences. Most people will enjoy watching this epic comic book collaboration. Ultron, the film's antagonist, serves as a great villain with an interesting god complex, and the movie is surprisingly deep. However the film suffers from some spotty special effects (which is surprising considering that Marvel had one of the best visual effects companies in the world working on it), some uneven tone, and rushed pacing (especially in terms of Ultron's creation). That being said, while it's not as good as The Avengers, Age of Ultron makes up for it's shortcomings with great dialogue and a gigantic climax, and is a great time at the theaters.",9,17,37,6 May 2015
The Dark Knight," A Modern Masterpiece
","A modern masterpiece of 21st Century Cinema. The Dark Knight combines great direction, with brilliant acting, and beautiful cinematography to create a film that transcends it genres and becomes a great film. This will remain a perfect example of why film is still worth shooting in, why practical effects should not be a thing of the past, and why the Oscars should pay attention to comic book films as they can be art in their own right. It serves as a comic book film, but also a tragedy of Shakespearean quality, with one of the best villains of the last 20 years. On top of that Christopher Nolan's unflinching faith in practical effects creates a truly realistic and beautiful experience.",10,3,4,6 May 2015
Everest," Beautiful, but Not Powerful.
","Everest is beautiful, well acted, and exciting, but reverts to clichés and lacks characters to care about. All movies based on a true story, about fighting the weather has the opportunity to be great. The premise lends itself to make an engrossing, emotionally gripping, and sometimes heart wrenching story. However Everest, lacks the character development necessary to be all of these things. The cinematography is stunning, and the actors are great, but a small piece is missing, and thus I feel the characters are clichés, that you struggle to feel for. To make an example, when I watch Casino, at the end when Joe Pesci's character dies, I get emotional, despite that the character is a murderer. I never felt truly emotional about the struggles of any of the characters in this film. Some characters die, and the way you know is you see a frozen corpse, there isn't an emotional moment for the character or the audience. In the end the film, is beautiful, and does a lot of things well, but I can't help feeling they missed the mark.",7,3,6,28 September 2015
Don't Breathe," Suspenseful and Clever, Despite a Few Plot Holes
","In a year with a string of impressive horror films, Don't Breathe is yet another good entry. Directed by Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead, 2013), this film shows that he has a talent for horror, and may be a rising presence in the genre. Don't Breathe is hold-your-breath scary, and features a clever premise, despite a few small plot holes. It is worth mentioning that the title and posters seemed a little ambiguous as to the plot, but watching the film the title seems appropriate.The first thing to mention about this film is that it is full of twists and turns, but does take a relatively practical approach to it's plot. The film's story is very smartly constructed, as it is full of tension from the opening moments, right up to the end. The film's biggest strength is its simplicity, as it makes the most of a very straightforward premise. That being said, the film is constructed in a way that obstacles are consistently thrown at the main characters in creative ways.Simply put the fact that the writers and directors were able to tell a story with such a clever yet simple premise makes it easy to follow. The impressive thing about this film is within a short period of time, the characters are well established and the premise, which is quite clever, is introduced. With all of the clichéd horror films today, putting empty characters in clichéd situations, it's refreshing to see relatable characters put into a straightforward premise. However, as happens in all horror films, the characters find everything is not as they expected it, and quickly discover they're in over their heads.The only problem with the film, is that it does cater to a few too many horror clichés and has a few glaring plot holes. While the obstacles in this film are creatively thrown at the main characters, a few of them don't make sense, with a little thought. The story at times, neglects to explain how something happened, and relies on a few Deus ex Machinas. The irony is that many of the plot holes, end up helping the villain character, as he seems almost inhuman by the end of the film. In the end, Don't Breathe does a brilliant job keeping the audience on the edge of their seats, with a combination of ingenuity and simplicity. The film offers a refreshing entry in the horror genre, which has seen a nice revival this year, from the typically clichéd horror films we get. The film isn't great, as it has a few too many plot holes, and clichés, but is still very entertaining. Horror buffs looking for a good film to get them into the Fall/Halloween season will likely enjoy this film.",8,5,10,30 August 2016
Sicario," A Stylish, Engrossing, Phenomenal Thriller
","Sicario is a completely engrossing, beautifully shot, terrifically acted thriller that exceeds expectations. I didn't know what to expect from this film, but I was surprised that from the opening shot the film had me hooked. I won't give away the opening scene, but I'd find it hard to believe that you're bored after seeing that. Emily Blunt and Benicio Del Toro are easily two of the better performances I've seen this year, and as per usual Villeneuve get's terrifically dark performances from his brilliant cast. Villeneuve's taut direction, combined with beautiful cinematography, and an amazing score, make Sicario one of his best in his constantly growing filmography. The end result is a great movie, that will almost definitely get recognition at award season.",9,1,5,3 October 2015
"McFarland, USA"," A Really Good, but not Great Sports Movie.
","I'm not going to criticize a film for being too sappy, to me that means the film makes me smile even when it's not funny. While the film is clichéd (like most sports films today), from the characters to the story it's very funny, and entertaining. The film is based on a true story so there's only so much room for originality, but it makes up for it's unoriginality in it's heart. Costner is good as the father/teacher/cross country coach, but the characters that steal the movie are the cross country runners in the movie. The film is funny, heartwarming, and filled with interesting characters. This is one of those films sports fans will love, so if that's your genre check this movie out.",8,5,16,6 May 2015
Psycho," A Terrifying Horror Film, and A Compositional Masterpiece
","Psycho is a classic horror film, directed by 'The Master of Suspense' Alfred Hitchcock. Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying. All-the-while setting the standard for how filmmakers would develop characters for years to come.",9,1,2,1 October 2015
The Witch," Unnerving, Wacky, and Super Realistic
","The Witch is a good movie, but it also has a very narrow audience. For those that love slow, yet tense, horror films that are as bizarre as they are scary, this film is for you. The Witch is unnerving, super realistic, and wacky to a fault. I will say that the film's writer and director Robert Eggers did an amazing job for a directorial debut, and he is undoubtedly a force to watch in the future.From the opening scene of the film to the very end the film is unnerving. The film is quite slow, but never really boring, because the filmmakers did a great job creating a very tense tone. The tone is essentially formed from three major elements of the movie, the bone-chilling music, the ominous cinematography (especially in the forest), and the always noticeable presence of darkness lurking. In this film the titular character isn't in the film often, but their presence is felt. Combine that with the excruciating attention to detail, and the film takes on a sense of reality.The film is extremely realistic, and that is because Eggers took the time, and had the attention to detail to make the film as realistic as possible. While the dialogue may distract some, it is exactly how people used to talk in the colonial era. The lighting is usually dim, but is to is realistic as the film is literally made to look as if it's being lit by candlelight or moonlight. The actors were on point, most likely due to great direction, and the sets were almost exactly what one would expect things to look like back then. That kind of dedication, deserves respect, but it also helps the audience get lost in the filmic world.However, the film is downright wacky, and in some ways that's great, and in others it hurt the film a little. The film is unlike anything I've ever seen before, in an interview Eggers said his original pitch was 'too weird, or too obscure' considering the film he made, I want to see that film because this one was wonderfully obscure and weird. However, the film was a little hard to follow, at times it felt as though too many things would happen in a short period filled with moments of confusion, which did help reinforce the insanity the characters were growing into, but made it harder to follow.It may not have helped the film, but as an observation, the film was devoid of humor. In the end, the film is original, unnerving, realistic, very well made, but does have an obscure feeling to it. The cinematography is beautiful, the filmmakers had an amazing attention to detail, and horror fans will most likely like the film. If you like the wacky, weird, obscure horror films that don't rely on clichés and jump scares, check this film out.",8,13,28,24 February 2016
Steve Jobs," Brilliant Acting, Character Development, and Pacing
","If you go into this movie expecting a film about Steve Jobs numerous achievements in the world of technology, this isn't quite that movie, this is more a movie about Steve Jobs the father. The film is anchored by terrific acting, character development, and pacing, which help make the film quite enjoyable. The story revolves not around Jobs entire life, but 3 separate events, and the minutia of the rest of his life, the structure to clarify is similar to last years Birdman, and the film is very different from 2013's Jobs.The acting in Steve Jobs is superb, perhaps most impressive of all is Kate Winslet's performance, as through most of the movie she transformed into her character, as did Michael Fassbender. Michael Fassbender will surely receive an Oscar nomination for this performance, as he literally transforms before the audience's eyes. Jeff Daniels is as was expected reliable and equally as great, but may get drowned out by the other performances. The other notable performance was that of Seth Rogen, who made a turn for the dramatic, and hit a home-run, completely selling himself as Steve Wozniak.The plot of the film is character driven, and in many ways the greatest strength of the film is the character development, especially that of Steve Jobs. Boyle and Fassbender perfectly capture the psychotic, frenetic, genius, bipolar attitude of Steve Jobs, while also showing a great character arch, as he evolves as a person. The film could have been a little too melodramatic, but the direction and acting save it. The acting and character development also help form the surprisingly frenetic pacing of the film. The film is paced like a day in a beehive, where every character is running in circles, never taking a moment to breath.On top of all of the acting, character development, and pacing the film is also funny, at times touching, and different from the other Jobs films. The film represents an award caliber performance by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle, and most of the cast. The only complaint may be the film's computer and business lingo is occasionally, not often but occasionally, too confusing for a non computer whiz to understand. Using great character development, acting, and pacing Steve Jobs is another great entry in Danny Boyle's ever impressive filmography.",9,0,3,23 October 2015
Sausage Party," If Pixar Had a Problem Child.
","Sausage Party, Seth Rogen's appropriately named Pixar-spoof/raunch fest, is here and it is actually pretty entertaining, if you're a sarcastic adult who enjoys shitting on everybody. Much like Deadpool did to the comic book genre earlier this year, Sausage Party takes aim at the animation genre, finally making an animation for adults. Sausage Party is as funny as it is clever, gleefully filled with profanity, but is also surprisingly thought provoking. Sausage Party never quite reaches the level of quality, of that which it pokes fun at, but does manage to do everything it set out to do.Watching this film it's incredible the ensemble cast that Seth Rogen was able to gather for this film, featuring James Franco, Jonah Hill, Paul Rudd, Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and so many more. The plot of this film is actually a fairly entertaining one, but the real strength of the film is it's humor. That isn't surprising, considering the group behind it, but the film in essence jumps from one joke to another never leaving a dull moment. The main reason that the film is so funny is that the film is clever in how it pokes fun at the world of food.Another reason that the film is so funny is that instead of trying to be politically correct, the film almost revels in it's ability to insult whoever it can. Animation has, over the years, proved to be a genre mostly directed at kids, besides a few exceptions (South Park, Family Guy, the Simpsons.) That being said the use of excessive profanity within that genre is so rare that it often elevates a raunchy animated comedy. Seeing a bunch of talking hot dogs, and buns that are animated to look like sexual images, and then swear non-stop ends up being one of the funnier elements of the film.It seems surprising that Pixar didn't beat Sausage Party to this story though, because it could've been an even better Pixar film. By that I mean that the story of this film is actually quite clever and thought provoking, when you say to yourself, what food think if it could talk. The plot is not as focused as a Pixar film and the characters are not as emotionally involving, so Sausage Party feels more like a cheaper, raunchy Pixar film. However, this film does manage to attack a fairly thought provoking and deep storyline.In the end, Sausage Party is a really good and often entertaining spoof of the animation genre for adults above a certain age, and of a certain mindset. The film tries to remain clear of racism, simply by insulting every group of people, without prejudice, we'll see if that method works. The film is clever, funny, thought provoking, and gleefully profane. It should be stated that not everybody will enjoy this movie, but that's partially the point.",8,20,44,15 August 2016
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," A Powerful Protest, and a Tragedy of the Failed System
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was a social protest film that attacked the social stereotypes and tragic failures of the mental health system. The film pulls no punches and is often hard to watch, but is so powerful in it's message that it remains a classic film of the 1970's. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a complex film, about complex people misidentified as simple. Much like other modern protest films One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest applies to one societal problem, but can transcend its subject matter and represent more modern problems, making it truly timeless.Many films have approached the community aspect of human life, some attacking it some defending it, this film seems to do both at the same time. The film contains a major paradox, both criticizing those who shun people from society for their differences, while showing that community is part of the human way of life, and that even society's rejects need community. Most of the shots throughout the film are medium or close ups, which most likely represents what a close group the patients are. It's both tragic, brilliant, and heartwarming to see how a group of neglected and forgotten people can band together, when society turns its back on them.The most impressive aspect of the film is the treatment of the characters, which is most likely a representation of the time it came out. Many of the characters in this film are connected by the fact that they have mental health issues, and they are rejects, but the characters are all distinctly different characters, and not just stereotypes. The treatment of the characters is impressive in it's own right, because today critics would probably say that the film is insensitive, it's humor is occasionally a little crude, but it's the exact opposite, the characters are treated as normal human beings, which is the most equal way to treat any character in any film.The movie contains a very angry message pointed at the methods of treatment for the mentally ill, and is an extremely powerful, albeit a little hard to watch, because of it. Simply put as the film progresses we see all of these characters, go through the horrific treatment they were subjected to, all the while following one main character, Randle. By the end of the film the main character is a vehicle for the message being sent, as the story takes Randall, a broken man, and breaks him permanently. By the end the audience should realize that they have watched a film, exemplifying the tragedy of the failing system.In conclusion One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a powerful, social protest film that uses great characters to send it's message. Beautifully acted, tragic, and infinitely complex, its message transcends its subject matter and represent a tragedy of the system's ineptitude. It's also one of the few movies that can tackle such a tough subject with care, respect, and finesse, it's just in general a great film.",9,2,3,21 October 2015
Pitch Perfect 2," Funny and Charming
","Pitch Perfect 2 is one of those sequels that isn't quite as good as it's predecessor, but uses the formula to remain entertaining. Much like the first film the cornerstones are the musical pieces and the humor, despite some racism/sexism. A good area of growth was the character development, as many characters are questioning their place on the team, and their futures which is interesting to watch. One problem I did have was with some of the jokes in the film, as they were a little repetitive, and at times too crude. In essence Pitch Perfect 2 is a fun, Glee Inspired, Musical with a few too many crude jokes, and clichés, but remains an entertaining sequel, that will please fans of the original.",7,3,4,22 August 2015
"Hail, Caesar!"," A Subtle, but Crowded Comedy
","Hail, Caesar! as a film feels very much like an attempt by the Coen Brothers to make an old-fashioned Hollywood film, in a day and age where it is not accepted. For those who love the films of 1950's Hollywood, and the general history of Hollywood this film is a great way to spend time. Hail, Caesar! is funny, well shot, but lacks the memorable stature of the previous Coen Brothers films. For those who love Coen Brother's films this is not there best, but is still enjoyable.Not that it is all that surprising but this film has quite a few moments that are truly laugh-out-loud funny, but the humor is more subtle. It should be noted that the film is not as funny as The Big Lebowski, so those hoping for another Coen Brothers comedy classic it may not be that funny. Another small problem with the humor is that while the film is funny, many of the funnier jokes are in the trailer, and naturally the film lacks surprises.Another trademark of the Coen Brothers is there beautiful cinematography, thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins. It seems ironic watching it because the film is set in 50's Hollywood and the film reels they watch look like some of the cleanest film of today. The overall look of the film is mesmerizing, and may be honored a year from now for it's cinematography. However, in many aspects the film falls short of the expectations that the Coen Brothers deserve today.While the film is a good and solid entry it has a few too many weaknesses. The villains of the film are a little weak, and because of the crowded story are never really fleshed out in a realistic way. On top of that the story is a little weak, often taking detours that aren't necessary, and often feeling as though what we're seeing isn't all that important. The film also seems to gloss over the consequences of characters actions, and tries to just be funny, but not over the top just subtly funny, which doesn't quite jive.In the end Hail, Caesar is a comedy for the thinking man who doesn't like the modern comedies that are often dumb and overbearing. Hail, Caesar is a film that looks back at 50's Hollywood lovingly, and for that reason is a great film for film buffs, especially those that love classic Hollywood. However, if you're expecting a great comedy that is both subtle, and brilliant like The Big Lebowski, this isn't quite that.",8,5,13,6 February 2016
Finding Dory," Funny, Touching, and Beautifully Animated
","Finding Dory, the long awaited sequel to Finding Nemo is here and while it's nowhere near as good as the original it's a pretty solid follow up. It should be stated that a solid follow up by Pixar is still a great film, as they've shown that they have making amazing films down to a science. Finding Dory is funny, beautifully animated, and often touching. It should be stated up front, that Finding Nemo is a nearly flawless film, and that when comparing them, Finding Dory doesn't quite live up, but on it's own merit it is still a great film.One major reason that Finding Dory is so good is that it's hilarious, and not just a few moments of humor, but hilarious throughout the entire film. Much like Finding Nemo the film gives voices to animals we see and throws their own wit into what those characters would say and do, much like the crabs and seagulls from the first film. It isn't as consistently hilarious as Finding Nemo and never reaches the same range of pure hilarity and heart stopping moments, but it does have quite a few of both. Above the humor of the film another major element that worked so well for the film is the animation which is gorgeous.This is true for both the film and it's short, both were gorgeously animated, so much so that it's becoming more and more realistic. Animating people still seems to be a work in progress, and we may never get that right, but when it comes to animals, Pixar seems to have a firm grip on making them look flawless. The only problem I have with this film is the story, which is okay, but coming from such a talented studio that consistently focuses on story, the story had some liberties and plot holes that aren't common from Pixar. That is the major area where Finding Nemo was so great and Finding Dory fell a little flat.However, Pixar's greatest strength over the years has been it's ability to make mass amounts of people feel something watching their films. This is an amazing accomplishment, because some people are easily invested in a film and get immersed easily, while some find it very hard to get immersed in films, but Pixar seems to know how to make everybody feel something watching their films. There are multiple moments in this film that do that, and convey as with many other Pixar greats an amazing amount of emotional depth. I typically say if a film can make somebody have a visceral reaction then it's a great film, I wouldn't say this film does that but it comes very close, which is impressive in it's own right.For those who loved Finding Nemo I wholeheartedly believe you'll love this film to, but restating the obvious don't expect it to match Finding Nemo. This film is hilarious, beautifully animated, touching, well paced, and features great voice acting. The film isn't as good as Finding Nemo, as it's story isn't quite as good and frankly was probably never going to be as good. That being said for all who love Pixar films, families especially, this is a great film to go see.",9,3,11,21 June 2016
The Big Short," A Funny, and Educational Drama
","The Big Short is one of those films that everybody could enjoy, and everybody should see. While the film is not perfect it is very funny, probably because the director is comedy specialist Adam McKay, and is also a somewhat important film because it's very revealing. The Big Short is interesting and educational, features a great ensemble, but is subject to some distracting camera-work. For anybody interested in the 2008 Housing Market Crash this film is perfect.The film begins with narration that addresses the biggest problem the film will have, which is that the Housing Market Crash of 2008 was an extremely complicated issue, that is why so few saw it coming. The story is so complicated, because it requires some understanding of how the housing system worked at the time, which apparently most of the people running the system at the time didn't even have, so the film ends up teaching the audience how the crash happened. That sounds boring, but the film does a brilliant job by doing it through hilarious cameos and lacing the overly informational pieces with humor. The film accomplishes the very hard task of making the mess understandable, and even teaching those interested enough about how it went wrong.When looking at it The Big Short clearly had a great script, with dialogue that just rolls, but in such a complicated movie the acting had to be good. Christian Bale is very good as the wacky Dr. Michael Burry, often embodying the odd personality he was tasked with, and even handling the task of showing a misunderstood genius. The other performer who was terrific was Steve Carell, who has consistently proved that he's not just a great comedy actor. While Carell is known for films like The 40 Year Old Virgin, last years Foxcatcher and now The Big Short prove that he can give a performance with emotional depth, and a sense of humanity.The only thing that the film really doesn't well is it's camera-work, which in such a complicated story seems too distracting. The Filmmakers felt they needed to rely on Close-Ups, rack focuses, and shaky movement. To be clear the film only feels so shaky, because much of the film is shot hand-held, and in close-ups, which will accentuate movement. It's easy with a lot of soft focus, which this film plays with a lot, to be pulled out of the film, and thus it requires even more effort from the audience to follow what's happening. To make an example it's like if somebody pointed at something in a dark cave at night, and then pointed a flashlight in your face, as you looked for it.In the end, The Big Short is a funny, intelligent, well-acted, and interesting view of the few men able to make money when everybody else was losing money hand over fist. The entire ensemble of talented big name actors carry their own weight, and some even rise above expectations. To be honest everybody should watch this film, because it tells the ever important story of how ignorance caused a worldwide meltdown, and we're apt to do it again if we don't learn from our mistakes.",8,3,6,13 January 2016
Straight Outta Compton," A Blast with Great Music
","Straight Outta Compton is a terrific journey through the music, and culture of the 80's and 90's despite it's stereotypes. This movie is fun to watch, for multiple reasons, but the biggest is the music. While you watch and jam out to the awesome music, you also get to see the culture and society of the 80's and 90's. Besides the music, the acting is also surprisingly good, as all of the actors are given moments to shine. My biggest complaint is the portrayal of police in the film, I understand that a large majority of police in Los Angeles were corrupt, but not every cop was a racist pig, I think the racist cops would have been even more resonating if we saw a normal cop every once and a while, not just a bunch of growling, racist, asses. In essence Straight Outta Compton is a funny, well acted, engrossing, music jam fest, that chronicles one of the more important rap groups of all time, but could have layed off of the stereotypes.",8,7,41,20 August 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Very Well Done Action, but Crowded and Rushed Story
","Batman v. Superman is finally here, and it's now official that DC is trying to match Marvel, but lacks the skillfulness. Batman v. Superman is probably one of, if not the most, hyped films of the year, where 2 of the most iconic comic-book characters finally come together on the big screen. Batman v. Superman is action packed, crowded, and rushed making it a true mixed bag. For those who want to enjoy a great action film, and don't care about some of the finer details, this will probably live up to expectations.As with it's predecessor Man of Steel, Batman v. Superman handles the action sequences really well. The film's special effects are also very good, and the character designs are very well done. It seems with this film most of the positives revolve around Ben Affleck and Batman, as he seems to be the main focus of the film. Batman's characterization seems to be the not just a shining spot in the cloud of carnage that is this film, but possibly one of the best Batman characterizations ever.On that note Batman saves this film, because the rest of the film is in a word, a mess. The film tries to do too much, which seems odd since Marvel's The Avengers was able to handle the same task perfectly. When looking at it Superman, Lois Lane, Wonder-Woman, Lex Luthor, and other various characters are underdeveloped simply because they aren't given enough screen time. Not only are they not given enough screen time, but the writers rush through shoddy plot points simply to get back to Batman, as if they know the only thing they were getting right was Batman.The issue with that is if the focus is Batman, then they made the wrong film here, and the film comes across as a wasted opportunity. The problem is the objective of the film, which was to do too much, and therefore rush through the underdeveloped story. Looking at it they either should have done a Batman standalone film or a smaller version of this, which focuses on Batman and Superman, not Wonder-Woman, Lois Lane, Perry White, and countless other throwaway characters. This is where Marvel gets it right and DC still hasn't figured it out.In the end Batman v. Superman is a decent popcorn flick, that contains amazing visuals and action sequences. The film isn't really bad, it just isn't great, when it really could have and therefore should have been. It should be said that while the film is rushed, crowded, paper-thin, and a little repetitive Ben Affleck and Zack Snyder did do a pretty good job getting Batman right, and that leaves potential for this franchise, but it's hanging on a thread. In the end if you're on the edge about seeing this film, it depends on what you want, if you want great action and visuals this is your film, if you want great story and characters, this is a weaker film.",6,0,3,24 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A Glorious Return to Glory
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens is everything we could have wanted and more, and feels like a return to glory for the franchise that needed redemption the most. Going into the film, the hype was insane, but whether or not the film would live up to it was to be determined. The Force Awakens is surprisingly funny, filled with stunning visuals, and features a lot of surprises in an age when spoilers rule. Some may have issues with decisions of the writers, but the filmmakers deserve credit for their devotion to the story.The most surprising aspect of The Force Awakens was the sense of humor, something the original trilogy and prequels had struggled with in different ways. The actors have a great chemistry, which helps the humor, especially between Chewbacca and Han Solo. The humor is brilliant, because it blends with the tone of the film, is very subtle, and is littered throughout the entire film. However, humor is not a trademark of Star Wars, at least not like visual effects are.The entire look of the film is gorgeous, this is because of various things, but the most important was J.J. Abrams and Disney's devotion to honoring the approach of the original films. The film was shot on film, while there's some debate, my opinion is that film looks far better than digital, and the film accentuates my point. Another decision that helped the film was the use of practical effects, which always look more real than digitally created creatures. The perfect mixture of CGI and Practical, along with the use of film makes The Force Awakens beautiful, and stunning to look at.The last element that stuck out to me, was the plot. I refuse to give away any elements, as I agree with Disney that this film should be viewed knowing as little as possible, but I will say there are tons of surprises in the film. While the plot did recycle some elements from earlier films, it did feel original in a lot of ways as well, and the few clichéd moments are forgivable in the grand scheme of things. The Force Awakens does the job many had hoped The Phantom Menace would do in 1999, and it does it well. It is truly subjective about what Star Wars film is your favorite, but for me The Force Awakens rivals that of the original, and even putting it in the same category is a compliment all it's own. Considering the fanbase for this film, and it's franchise it's good to see that Star Wars has finally gotten back to the quality we all knew it could.",9,5,20,17 December 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A True Science Fiction Masterpiece
","In 1977 Star Wars changed the film world forever, one could even argue that no film has had the same effect that Star Wars has. Star Wars represents many aspects of an Epic, but is at it's core a classic example of Science Fiction at it's peak potential. Star Wars stands as one of the best Science Fiction films because it in many ways exemplifies the Science Fiction genre, terrifically uses visual storytelling, despite not being the most original work ever made. Star Wars in many ways defines Science Fiction, because it has since the late 70's been copied endlessly.While Star wars encompasses many elements of an Epic, such as the iconic score, grand scope, lavish costumes, and use of a large panoramic backdrop, but it is more Science Fiction. When defining Science Fiction there are some major elements that are all present in Star Wars. Star Wars contains the most famous unknown force in film in the force. It deals with lots of futuristic technology such as Space Ships, and Light Sabers, and it contains the ultimate Science Fiction villain of all time, Darth Vader. The villains while a great example of the Science Fiction elements are an even better example of the visual storytelling. Film, being a visual medium, is always more impressive when the story is told visually. The villains in Star Wars will be seen as bland characters, that are very uniform, and wear either white, black, or gray. Watching Star Wars you can clearly see a parallel between the Evil Empire and the Nazi Party, which makes them seem even more sinister. The use of color and parallels makes villains identifiable, on the opposite end the heroes dress diversely and colorfully, representing the difference. The film also used great visual acting to tell its story, in that the actors mannerisms are more powerful than their words. The film is also a visual effects masterpiece, partly because of an emphasis on practical effects, and location shooting. The story has one other major reason that it's easily told visually, and that's the familiarity with other films. Star Wars is far from original, it took many elements from Akira Kurosawa's 'The Hidden Fortress', Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis, and Frankenstein. An example of this is that Darth Vader is essentially a robotic version of Frankenstein's monster. However, Star Wars proves that a change in genre, location, and overall look can make an unoriginal film seem original, for instance the light saber seems very original but is essentially a variation on the samurai sword. On top of that the characters in Star Wars are variations of the archetypes, like the old mentor, hero, and rough escort.Despite that Star Wars wasn't the most original film, it has been copied numerous times, making it one of the most influential films ever made. Containing some of the best visual effects, of its time, and one of the best scores of all time the film boasts plenty of reasons it remains timeless. In the end Star Wars will probably remain timeless because of it's visual storytelling and variations of age old themes, characters, and plot points, while making them seem original.",9,0,1,27 October 2015
Deadpool," Hilarious, Smart, and Well-Paced
","Fans of Deadpool have waited at least 7 years for the 'Merc with a Mouth'to get his own film, and finally we have it, but even better is after the wait it delivers. Ryan Reynolds is perfectly cast as Deadpool, and his dedication to getting the character right forms a true portrayal of a character that is very hard to get right, as we learned 7 years ago. Deadpool is hilarious, bitingly smart, and paced like the foul mouthed energizer bunny from hell. In an interview Reynolds said this film has been in production for 11 years, it would seem that the long wait helped the film, because by the time they finally made it, everybody involved wanted to get it right.Deadpool is genuinely hilarious film, by that I mean there are multiple times where everybody in the theater laugh hysterically. The film is even funnier for those that love, and know all about comic book films, because it makes snide comments about the studio and the genre all throughout. Fans of the character will appreciate the fact that Deadpool doesn't pull any punches, it's hilarious from the opening credits to the post credits scene. On top of that Reynolds comedic chops are perfectly complemented by the foul mouthed anti-hero.It shouldn't come as any kind of a surprise that Deadpool is a meta film, as the character's trademarks are breaking the fourth wall, and poking fun at other comic book characters. The film manages to avoid being clichéd, because of it's meta film approach and while not dodging all clichés it winks when it uses one. For those that have seen or genuinely obsess over comic book films, the film is littered with snide pokes at the genre, and a warning for those interested these pokes come early and often. The film is witty to a fault, and honors the character perfectly.From the hilarious opening of the film to the post credits scene the pacing of the film is frenetic. The film begins with a bang, and brilliantly tells it's story in a non-linear format that keeps the film from ever feeling slow. It would have been nice if the low budget hadn't been so noticeable, despite the fact that it gives Deadpool plenty of fodder. One thing that seemed poorly done was the Colossus character, because he's featured in the other X-Men films as a completely different character in look and personality.In the end lovers of the deadpool character will love the film, because it's faithful to everything the character embodies. The film is smart, funny, well-paced, and builds off Reynolds performance to make a genuinely entertaining film. The film has a few small flaws that are few and far between, but overall succeeds in respectfully bringing 'The Merc with a Mouth' to the big screen. Note that this film is very mature, but when looking for a great film for an adult's night out this film is perfect.",8,6,19,11 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," When Bond met Vaughn.
","This is essentially a fun, modernized, homage to the 60s bond films. It's really nice if you love the old bond films more than the modernized bond and you wanted to see that again. However, do not confuse this with the old bond films it's far crazier than any bond film I've ever seen. That being said the films self awareness makes it a fun movie to watch. The humor, action, pacing and villain make this movie a blast to watch. All in all Samuel L. Jackson and Colin Firth are great, and Taron Egerton carries the film well. So if you've ever wondered what a modern, fun, crazy bond film would be like this is your film.",8,2,9,6 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Almost Flawless
","Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great.",10,2,4,28 October 2015
Spectre," An Entertaining Film, with A Weak Narrative.
","Spectre, possibly Daniel Craig's final Bond film maintains the approach of departing from the older tone of Bond, while also lovingly referencing them. The film came at an inopportune time, as it has a similar plot to recent films such as 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' and 'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation.' Spectre is entertaining, action packed, but a little too formulaic. In the end though the film is a good time at the theaters.Spectre maintains the tone and feel of Skyfall, also directed by Sam Mendes, but lacks the finesse of Skyfall. Daniel Craig, Lea Seydoux, Christoph Waltz are all good in their respective roles, and help make the film more entertaining. The film also does a good job remaining serious, yet funny much like Skyfall, but despite good acting, humor, and tone the biggest strength of the film is that it is action packed.The film is a little too long, but the action sequences are entertaining to watch, and fairly well shot. The best action sequences are those between Daniel Craig and Dave Bautista, mostly because Bautista embodies the silent powerful henchmen. The film does suffer from many weaknesses though, and is nowhere near as good as Skyfall. The biggest problem with the film is the plot.The plot is a little too formulaic, as many plot points are straight out of other bond films, or other recent films, and thus become a little too predictable. The character development is bad, as they are given little development, and some characters are only in the film for minutes. The story is thinned out a little too much, and the villain is a little weak, despite Waltz's performance. It would have been refreshing to see Spectre be as carefully crafted as Skyfall.In the end Spectre's tone, acting, and action are good, but the plot of the film is very weak. The film will likely satisfy Bond fans, and some casual fans, but is a little formulaic, and a little predictable. At the same time the film is not the best Bond film ever, and is probably the weakest of the Daniel Craig filmography.",7,7,20,5 November 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Non Stop Action Fest
","Mad Max Fury Road is a non stop action thrill ride that barely pauses, and never disappoints. I would feel remiss if I did not mention that if you're a person who dislikes the wacky and weird this is not for you. The characters are all very interesting and well developed, the action sequences are amazing, the pacing is almost non stop, and the villain is almost like a combination between Darth Vader and a possessed Santa Claus. While the film may not be quite as good as Road warrior, it comes very close which is an accomplishment in its own right. In essence Mad Max Fury Road is a great time at the theaters, one that I suggest you see in theaters, because it's such a great experience.",9,3,8,15 May 2015
Warcraft," A Rushed and Messy Film
","The film adaptations of video games have, up to this point, been bad but there was hope for the gamer community that Warcraft could break through, but it was, in my opinion a disappointment. The potential impact of this film was obvious, gamers who are hungry for high quality film adaptations of their favorite games, are still waiting for a film to prove that it can be done. Warcraft is clichéd, poorly written, and not as entertaining or deep as it could and therefore should have been. I don't want people thinking I hated this movie, because it did some things well and plenty of people have said they enjoyed it, I simply didn't.The most painful thing about the movie was that it had a lot of good aspects, but as a whole the film felt a little weak. One major problem I had with this film was that it reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit. Regardless of the agitation that statement will incur out of die hard fans, one prime example is the main antagonist of the film, the orcs, ride around on giant evil looking wolves, just like in Lord of the Rings. Above that the film as a whole looked too digitized, where in certain scenes, everything in the scene looked digitally created.The movie was directed by the immensely talented Duncan Jones, and to be honest the world he creates, is very intriguing. However, the script was a major weakness of this film, because inside this film is a cool story worth telling but it was overcrowded with weak characters and muddled storytelling. The film leaps around so much, trying very hard to tell a dense story, that it becomes very hard to follow, and almost impossible to care about any characters. From a technical standpoint it jumps around so much, that at times the film disregards explanation.The weak story, and rushed pacing make the film feel overcrowded, and hard to really enjoy. While some of the characters had very cool development, many of them flash through for momentary exposition and then disappear for 20 minutes. The orc villain is admittedly cool to look at, albeit a little one dimensional, but the overall evil force in the film is essentially an unexplained force. The film really never feels like it entertains or challenges like Jones' other films (Moon and The Source Code), it just trudges forward.It isn't a terrible film, and I'm guessing many will enjoy this film, if for no other reason than that it is a good 2 hour escape from reality. That being said for those who are looking for a entertaining, witty, original film this just isn't really that, as it never allows itself to delve deeply into any scene. The film features a great amount of potential, which only serves to make the muddled end result even more depressing, as the film clearly could have been better. All-in- all I think kids will like this film, but for those who want a great film, this just isn't quite that.",5,3,11,13 June 2016
13 Hours," A Ver Patriotic, But Complex, and Clichéd Film.
","Michael Bay in every film he's done has shown that he bleeds red, white, and blue, so go into this film knowing it's very patriotic. For those who want a war film that is patriotic, action-packed, and honors its heroes stop reading, because this is the film you want to see. For those looking for a great war film, 13 Hours is an action packed film, that offers little clarity on the complex subject, and is filled with clichés. My opinion is this film came way too early, and if this film had been made in 5 to 10 years, the story would have been more fleshed out.Michael Bay is a great director when it comes to framing and shooting action sequences, this film showcases that. The film is loaded with action and uses very effective practical effects, making every explosion feel and look real. For a war film, it has a pretty good sense of humor, which helps lighten up the mood at times, and the performances are spot on. As well the film does a great job honoring the heroes of that day, in essence, it's a very patriotic film.However, for those looking for a film that was going to delve into the controversial story of what happened on September 11th, 2012, and give clarity, this film doesn't do that. In fact, the storytelling in this film is quite weak. The first act of the plot focuses too much on irrelevant subplots that dilute the film, and glosses over crucial moments, like for instance why the fighter jets in Italy didn't come for assistance. The film ends up being, even more, confusing because the filmmakers were too afraid to offend either political party that is eagerly watching the impact of this film. Another problem the film suffers, independent from the fear of political ramifications is the fact that the film is loaded with clichés. On top of that many of the characters, are either clichéd stereotypes or underdeveloped. Even more disappointing is that the terrorist characters are weak, as the film doesn't go in depth on who they are, or why they attack the consulate in the first place. So the true story of 6 brave heroes, becomes more of a shallow action/war film, and less a true story about these heroes. In the end, for those who want to see this movie because it's a true story about 6 soldiers who courageously fought to protect American lives, in hostile Libya, this film won't disappoint. For those who want a film that tells a story that is well-crafted and easy to follow, while delving into the ever complex details, this isn't that. This film is still very patriotic, and it seems as though that's the biggest reason to see this movie, not to politicize, but to honor heroes, both fallen and alive. It's truly a discretionary call on whether or not to see this film.",5,13,46,15 January 2016
The Martian," A Thrilling Journey Into Deep Space
","The Martian is a thrilling journey into the deep space anchored by amazing visuals and great acting. In the recent past Ridley Scott had been struggling to make a great movie, but he went back to his basics, and churned out one of the better Sci-Fi movies not just of this year, but of the past few years. While all actors are good, this movie is the Matt Damon show, and he shines as a desperate man stranded millions of miles from home. The film will undeniably be compared to Interstellar, because the cast and some of the premise are similar, but these are two very different movies. The amazing special effects, and constant obstacles make this movie truly thrilling. The Martian is my favorite of the Space Sci-Fi movies in the recent years, more than Gravity or Interstellar. The Martian is truly a theater experience, so see it on the biggest screen you can.",9,15,75,3 October 2015
Furious 7," Fun, Dumb, and Touching
","Over the Top car stunts, combined with a great sense of fun, and fast paced action sequences make Furious 7 a great example of dumb fun done right. Perhaps the greatest strength of Furious 7 is that it takes the stunts of the last film and ups the ante even more. Even more impressive is that while the whole film thrills the part that will hit you the hardest is the unavoidable ending. Which is what I want to focus on, yes the films funny, yes it's fast paced, and yes it over does the family themes, but the ending of this film as I'm sure you've heard, if not seen, is what makes this film so good. Being a filmmaker your single greatest achievement is to make an audience feel emotional, whether it be sad, really happy, shocked (not gore shock, but shocked by the plot), or any other great emotion. The ending of this movie makes just about everybody feel something, which is a massive accomplishment.",8,1,4,6 May 2015
