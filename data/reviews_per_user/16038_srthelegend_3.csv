Blade Runner 2049," So 35 years of wait is finally over... Was it worth the wait???
","This is my updated review as I feel I did not do the movie justice and I have also increased my score of the movie...
I was one of the lucky ones who got to see an early preview.... And the more that time passes by and the more the story of Blade Runner 2049 sinks in the more the gravity of the story hits me... First of all it really was not what I was expecting... I had watched many trailers and interviews and I feel like I had done quite a successful job in staying away from spoilers.... 
And....
Without spoiling it for anyone else and giving too much away.... Whatever you think you know about the film... well, forget it.... You're way off the mark... 
The best advice I can give though is however dark you think Blade Runner 2049 is.... It's darker than that.... It's much darker than the original... And the original was quite dark.... The cinematography is beautiful... it really is stunning... but the film itself.... did I mention it was dark??.. I think this is amplified (excuse the pun) by the movie's soundtrack... The work of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch was for me... at times.... malevolent... And perhaps if the music wasn't so dark and hostile the movie itself wouldn't come across like that also... But then what do I know?... That's not to say the music is bad... It was for me.... like I said malevolent.... As for the movie itself... Again without giving too much away.... It's a story of loneliness.... A story of wanting nothing more than to be accepted... It's a story of desperate hope and anguish... Wanting for a better life.... Replicants being more human than humans, being more perfect than humans.... but not being human and wanting nothing more than to be human... even for all the faults the human race has and the perfection of the replicant race... Still the desperate hope and anguish of wanting to be human.... Are you keeping up??... And this whole time living in a dystopian world.... where the future of the human race is a lost cause and Mother Earth has never looked so heartbroken.... 
Speaking of heartbreak... again without spoiling the story... be prepared... the whole story is a story of heartbreak and literally at every turn Ryan Gosling is having his heart broken.... whether that be his relationships with others or his life in general... For me Ryan Gosling has a knack of playing the lonely leading role... and he has done this on a few occasions now.... both in the movies - 'Drive' and 'Only God Forgives'.... which I hope he doesn't end up being typecast in... but saying that... I don't think there is an actor alive today who can play the role of being totally isolated from the rest of the world better than Ryan Gosling.
Blade Runner 2049 did have some nice surprises... which again... I won't spoil... 
In closing.... Ryan Gosling is excellent... It is Harrison Ford's best work for years.... This overall review may sound like I'm being negative about Blade Runner 2049... But I'm not... I'm really not...I should also mention the performances from the female leading acts in the show. Ana de Armas, Robin Wright and Sylvia Hoeks are all very, very good and each and every one of them. Including all the crew should be proud of such a beautiful sequel. As for where it stands next to the original... I never thought I'd hear myself saying this but I think as years pass by it will stand next to the original Blade Runner quite easily.... It's not the same movie as the original but it is as good as the original in its own right...
I think Ryan Gosling said it best in an interview
The film is incredible... it's.... haunting...
With this in mind a few days have passed now and I am still left with a feeling of being haunted by Blade Runner 2049.... 
So much so that I want to see it again and I will go and see it again... and again... and again....
Just like I did the original...
Blade Runner 2049 'is' incredible....
It's...

It," It is a hit... or is it??
","I didn't really have much interest in seeing this, but I was bored and decided to go and see it....And....I was pleasantly surprised... I may be repeating what other people said, but I try not to read other reviews as to keep an open mind...I felt very much a - 'Stand By Me'... 'Goonies'... 80's kind of vibe... which I believe was the goal in this movie... I found myself very much on the side of the kids... in particular the character played by Jeremy Ray Taylor and Finn Wolfhard... These young actors really stole the show for me...However as for 'it' being scary... Is there such a thing as an actual scary movie anymore?? Bearing in mind I am getting old now... I couldn't take Pennywise seriously and didn't find him scary at all... Bill Skarsgård played the part well.. but he wasn't as good as Tim Curry... He was good... Just not as goodWithout sounding cliché 'it' is nothing compared to the book... But then again what film is?? Anyway, the film was good... it just wasn't great",6,0,3,5 October 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," 'If you only go and see one movie at the cinema this year... go and see this'
","Where do I begin...?I was a kid born in the 80's... My parents I believe had a good taste in music raising me on the likes of Queen and Pink Floyd... to name a few... I was lucky enough to experience Queen at Live Aid and on the 'A Kind Of Magic' Tour and I have some wonderful memories...Now 30 odd years later my Mum had mentioned to me a few times if I'd like to go and see the movie... I had watched trailers and I actually thought... this looks quite funny. I quite fancy it.What can I say...?I would say, 'Forget the negative reviews from the critics and go and see this movie'It has everything... Laughs... stupidness... seriousness... but perhaps most importantly... sadness.It absolutely broke my heart and after a week I still find myself singing the song, 'Love Of My Life'Yes... the movie is more of a Freddie Bipoic than a Queen Biopic... it may bend the truth in parts I won't argue with that... but it is still a wonderful movie.For all the fame and money and everything else Freddie had he was a desperately lonely and lost and sad soul and if he was alive today and I had the opportunity to bump into him I'd give the man a hug and tell him you're a good person and don't let anyone tell you different.The rest of the cast work so well together and if I didn't know any better I'd say that the guy who plays Brian May was his sonI am so glad I went to see this movie and it has really left a mark on meI thought they didn't make movies like this anymore... I was wrong... they do... and I've never been more happy to be wrong",9,2,4,5 November 2018
