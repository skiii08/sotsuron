The Blair Witch Project," All the hype and no umph
",I saw the movie and wasnt too satisfied with it. All the media that said it was up to be and it didnt scare me. My friend just got dizzy. For all the fighting and the cussing I thought it was one of those trips that 'The Real World' (series) has.,Null,0,1,14 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Wow!
","This movie is wonderfully made with special effects, great acting and great writing. I so far, have seen it once. All the actors and actresses are great. Natalie Portman playing two parts was wonderful. > Jar Jar Binks was so funny I almost fell out of my seat. The effects were made outstanding as usual. Thanks to George Lucas and the rest of the cast and crew for the hard work. I was very satisfied with the whole movie.",10,5,7,22 May 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," Another Great Movie
","I am not much into action movies but this one is my favorite of all time. First film of super young actress Natalie Portman. Wonderfully acted and talented as a child who becomes orphaned and befriends a hitman. The Cleaner is a good guy, kills only bad men 'no women, no children'. Has some funny bits and sad bits in the movie. I enjoyed where she always got the two kicked out of the hotels/motels. The part where they both act like movie stars and singers. Portman did a great Madonna and Ms. Monroe. Great movie director. Love all his latest movies he has made.",10,1,3,22 May 1999
Toy Story 2," Better Than The First One
","Toy Story 2 is way better than the first one. Even if I do have the first Toy Story on VHS, Toy Story 2 is funnier. I was laughing so much I thought I lost my voice at the end of the movie. I recommend the movie to to be seen by everyone. Young or old it doesn't matter who you are. You have to see it!",10,0,1,7 December 1999
