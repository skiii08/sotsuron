Lucky Number Slevin," Lucky # indeed, The world needs more movies like this!
","I thought that this movie was absolutely brilliant. I went in just expecting an average action movie, maybe with a bit of humor as well (judging from the trailer). What i got was something completely different. In the best way possible.The whole movie all the way had me engrossed entirely in the film. There were twists and turns galore. The entire time your watching you think you can predict things that are going to be revealed later. The results are completely different and mezmerizing. At least in my case i got surprise after surprise. Bruce Willis was the show stealer as World Class Assassin Mr. Goodkat. Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley were brilliant as always. Not to mention, surprisingly, Josh Hartnett hasn't been this good since i can remember. He was great.So if your looking for a movie with twists and turns galore, great action sequences, witty dialogue, and is a film you'll have in your mind for weeks to come. All i could think about after watching it is how much i wanted to see it again.",10,7,19,2 April 2006
