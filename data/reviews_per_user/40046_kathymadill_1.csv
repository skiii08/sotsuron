First Man," How can you dis this movie?
","I finally saw this movie. I loved it. I cried. I laughed. It was beautiful. It was not the average space history movie. It was better. I always wondered about Armstrong being such a private person. Losing a child like he did would do it. How he over-came the obstacles in his life to accomplish all he did is a miracle. I lost my husband to leukemia almost 4 years ago and I'm still struggling. How this man made it back to help build our space program with all of the tragedy in his life I am amazed. Arm-
strong was a very private man when he returned from the moon. I was surprised by
that. So many astronauts have been public figures; but not Armstrong. This movie was a great way to tell America about this hero of ours that we hardly knew. I had read so many negative reviews about this movie I delayed seeing it. I regret that now. It was a great movie. Those of you who gave it negative reviews make me wonder where your hearts are. It wasn't supposed to be another movie like APOLLO 13. I figured that out when Neil's little girl died near the start of the movie. If the ending is true, it's amazing. I loved it.",9,2,5,25 February 2019
