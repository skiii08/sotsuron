Kill Bill: Vol. 2," So much better than Vol. 1.. SPOILER!!
","Personally, I thought that the second movie was better than the first one. Vol 1 didn't have a plot, just massive killing and the revenge to kill Bill. I fast forwarded through the whole fight scene in the restaurant when the Bride was going to kill O-Ren. The scene was ridiculously long and the killing was so dumb. Like when the Bride cut off a person's arm the blood squirts out like a water fountain... unrealistic. Also I thought the whole anime scene was bad. Yes, unique because not a whole lot of movies incorporate cartoon drawings to the movie but c'mon. The second one actually had more plot than random killing. There was emotion and a story. The whole situation came out as to why Bill tried to kill Bea Kiddo. But there was still awesome action so it balanced out. I loved when she crawled out of the grave and went to the diner for a glass of water. Hilarious!! Not many movies can pull off a better sequel but this one has!! One thing I didn't understand. Why didn't she finish off the girl with the eye patch (sorry I forgot her name). She poked out the eyeball but why not finish her?? Or did she?",10,0,1,26 February 2005
