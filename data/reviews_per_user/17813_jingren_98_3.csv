Changeling," 'And I have the envelope, the Oscar for Best Picture goes toÂ…'
","Despite the movie's length, this can be said as Clint Eastwood's 2nd best movie of 2000s following 'Million Dollar Baby'. After watching this masterpiece, I was left speechless although there were a million thoughts and feelings in me about the movie.I personally think that it's either Angelina won a 2nd Oscar for her role in this movie or her only Oscar is for this role. Despite her age, she played a single-mother: Christine Collins, so well that I would spend $663942719372489 to fly to US and give her an Oscar straight away.As usual, Clint have us another masterpiece of his. Only this time round, more influential, to me at least. Why? Because it's based on true events of 1920s' L.A. 'Chsngeling' was a true story filled with immorality, cruelty, vengeance, corruption, tragedy, tears, blood, justice and finally, the great love of any family on Earth.Although I feel that there are many parts of this movie that are way too cruel, or rather difficult to watch, I was satisfied with how the writer ended the movie. Yes, we didn't know whether Christine and Walter reunite, but the ending gave us something: hope.If 'Slumdog Millionaire' and 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button' weren't released in 2008, I truly think that this would've won Best Picture, at least get nominated and Clint Eastwood might also have at least been nominated for Best Director.In conclusion, if you're a person who can stand tragic dramas and if you're a righteous person, you would love this movie. Go watch, it's worth it and you won't regret! Just bare the length of this movie in mind.",10,2,3,10 December 2012
Gravity," Just when one thought that 'After 'Alien' & 'Aliens', Sci-Fi goes generally downhill', there's 'Gravity'
","'In space, no one can hear you scream.' In the past, this ALAWAYS symbolizes 'Alien' for me, arguably the best Sci-Fi film ever. Next came 'Aliens', the movie which puts James Cameron at the A category. However, after these 2, I thought 'What a pity, Sci-Fi is such an amazing genre, but from here, it's going generally downhill.'Then came the year 2013.Somewhere around late August or so, I came across this ad with the trailer, an upcoming Sci-Fi film called 'Gravity', starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. I thought 'Hey, even if this won't be a great Sci-Fi, it'll still be a box office hit.'THEN, I watched the trailer and as god be my witness it was one of the fastest 2 minutes of my life and goosebumps went all over my body. I thought 'God, please bring back the awesomeness space movies used to have.'FINALLY, I was lucky enough to catch a sneak preview in my country yesterday night. Boy, did I regret!?Starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, with Ed Harris. I dare not say that this is as good as or better than 'Alien' and/or 'Aliens', but I won't be surprised to see 'Gravity' at next year's Academy Awards.Essentially, if you're a Sci-Fi cinemaniac, and you enjoyed 'Alien' and/or 'Aliens', welcome back to space with zero 'Gravity'!!!10/10",10,2,5,6 October 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Just an opinion, feel free to disagree, I know you'll
","*NOTE: In the event you find any part of this review rude and/or offensive in tone and/or language, here's an apology, sorry.Allow me to say: unless you find something illogical, unreasonable, unfair, etc, don't disagree and/or criticize what other people said, everyone has the right to feel and think differently.I think by now you should know that I didn't quite think about all perspectives before reviewing this movie but I've to say: to me, watching a movie, depth and meaning are more significant than entertainment. And you can expect me saying, movies like The Hobbit, LOTR, The Dark Knight trilogy, The Avengers, have absolute entertainment, I can't disagree. However, as hard as I tried, I couldn't find a lesson to learn from such movies when it comes to life, humanity, kindness, etc. If you take in consideration for the mere theme of good vs. evil, I'm sorry, I can't and I don't wanna buy that. How many movies are based simply on good vs. evil? It doesn't stand out, take for an example a movie like 'Forrest Gump', I believe that as much as you wanna disagree with me, you just can't lie to yourself by denying that it wasn't inspiring. Movies, to me, depth and meaning are more valuable than entertainment. This also sort of answered a question I first asked myself many years ago: why does the Oscars rarely honors movies as such (other than LOTR) with Best Picture? Oh yes, they lack depth and meaning, no wonder 'Forrest Gump' won Best Picture.But like I said, I'm no one to defy and/or offend (etc) anyone just because I disagree with him/her/them, but I've the right to express my views. So, disagree with me, dislike this review, I'm perfectly fine. I just hope that at least we all go through each other's words while holding on to our own views and opinions. Have a nice day!",1,17,37,14 December 2013
