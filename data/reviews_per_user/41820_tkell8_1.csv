Raiders of the Lost Ark," The way an action movie should be made
","Early eighties movie that was great. Despite the dated special effects (melting faces, reflected snakes, bouncing rocks) this is the best movie made to date. It was a good decision for Spielberg to opt out of making 'For your eyes only' or whatever Bond movie that was next. The plot is 30's dashing and derring do? The villains are gumptious and the ending is out of the Daliesqe imagery. Without digressing to the obvious the main character is not dead and acting like a ghost, or crawling through ventilation ducts. Rather he is a normal archeologist who does not like the Nazis or snakes or the same leading lady.",10,0,0,2 July 2004
