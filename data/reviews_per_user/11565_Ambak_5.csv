Skyfall," Bang, Crash, (Cods)Wallop
","The usual 21st century Bond demolition derby with lots of ear shattering explosions and general destructive mayhem. The attempts at injecting humour generally fall flat and the villain is more of a puppet than The Hood from 'Thunderbirds'. Not very exotic locations, all seen at night anyway, Daniel Craig looks more like George Sewell from 'Special Branch' than ever and since when have tube trains run on the District Line? (It's a sub surface line and uses normal height rolling stock). The Aston Martin DB5 makes a re-appearance but, as in the Brosnan years, still lacks the revolving number plate box on the front bumper (it has a normal plate screwed to the bumper instead). Oh well, back to the Blu-ray box set!",5,18,43,26 October 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Bad reboot II
","Well, it's not saying much but this a slight improvement on the first reboot. At least the characters develop a sliver of recognisability. The problem, of course, is that we know that the crew will not die, otherwise there couldn't have been an original series, which rather neuters the tension. All thats left is a lot of noisy CGI effects (what happened to those nice quiet phasers). The movie seems to come to a natural conclusion but then carries on for another thirty minutes of headache inducing action as if somebody suddenly realised that they hadn't used all of the CGI budget. As for the title, it's pretty meaningless but I suppose that they couldn't call it Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan II (or is that minus one)",5,40,70,9 May 2013
Rush," Better than Driven!
","As Hollywood recreations of real events go, this is not too bad. Of course liberties have been taken with the facts, but this is inevitable when the events of several years are compressed into a couple of hours. The recreation of racing in the seventies is generally well done but for those who lived through the 1976 season the movie lacks dramatic impact. Hemsworth and Bruhl do a good job as Hunt and Lauda, but the other roles are virtually bit parts. The portrayal of BRM's Louis Stanley (a notorious tyrant) is particularly poor. If you know nothing of seventies racing you may enjoy it, but if you are not a racing fan it probably has little to offer.",7,8,26,4 September 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Overlong fantasy
","This is a lengthy sanitised version of what actually happened when Walt Disney finally managed to get P.L.Travers to allow him to film Mary Poppins. Tom Hanks' avuncular 'Walt Disney' is a long way from the reality of the chain smoking mogul (unsurprisingly). Emma Thompson, as usual, plays Emma Thompson (in the same way that Colin Firth always plays Colin Firth). Nothing wrong with that if your name is John Wayne, but this is supposed to be a character piece. Thompson neither looks or sounds like P.L.Travers and is far too young for the role (Travers was in her early sixties at the time and looked it). As the taped conversations featuring the real Travers over the end credits show, she was far less irascible than the Thompson portrayal. The boring and badly acted 'Australian' segments (which look like the wild west complete with American train) are largely irrelevant. The period setting is realised without too many goofs, although the same '57 Ford is seen at least three times and why is Travers shown aboard a BOAC aircraft (correctly) but all reference at LAX (and on her ticket) is to a fictional 'British Transatlantic Airways'? This might have made a good ninety minute TV movie, but as it is, unless you are a massive Mary Poppins fan, is not really worth two hours of your time.",3,33,67,3 December 2013
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Carry on murdering
","Thanks to Blu-ray, I've been revisiting the Indiana Jones movies and have just sat through The Last Crusade. Now, I never much cared for this when it came out, but how on earth this claptrap can have such a high rating on IMDb is a mystery. Maybe Spielberg was trying to make a 'Carry on' film. This could have been titled Abbott and Costello and the Holy Grail, with it's pathetic attempts at humour. Connery is about as convincing as Ford's father as Jessie Royce Landis was as Cary Grant's mother in North by Northwest. And strange though it may seem, in 1938 it was illegal to kill German soldiers in cold blood, which Indiana Jones does with reckless abandon, and without any official sanction (at least James Bond had a licence to kill). Groan inducing scene follows groan inducing scene until the thing grinds to a halt, unfortunately at least forty five minutes too late.",1,25,53,8 December 2012
