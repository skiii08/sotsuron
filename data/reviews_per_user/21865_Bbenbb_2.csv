The Avengers," Best Marvel Comic Movie Yet!!
","This is definitely one to see in theaters.The clashes, unworldly displays and explosions are impressive enough, but the director's unique presentation through camera angles and gut-wrenching motions can only be appreciated on the big screen, and with big surround sound speakers.Joss Whedon's philosophical prowess is a perfect match for the comic book genre. The moral thread that ties each character together as a team is subtly challenged. The clashes between epic characters if considered as a battle between personal philosophies matches the booming fireworks we see on the screen.An essential element for tying each character together is to give each character their 15 minutes. Whedon has a talent for this. We are drawn to the less powerful super heroes who aren't so fantastic but whom we can relate to. From there we eventually relate to and appreciate a demigod.It is a spectacle from beginning to end... more so near the end.",9,1,4,5 May 2012
The Conjuring," A Ghost Story Done Right
","This kind of story has been done many times before. But The Conjuring captures a vital element that most others fail at, something absolutely vital to a horror film. And it does it without excessive swearing, sex, or gore. And that vital element is family relationship. You are immediately wrapped in a by-gone era when siblings are close and parents are doing everything they can to live the American dream. James Wan brilliantly reinforces the warm atmosphere with subtle camera work, pacing, and music. The relationships are put to the test when malevolent forces threaten what they hold most dear.Powerful writing like this is very rare in films these days. It plays on the paranoia everyone feels at some point, as a child, as a mother, as a father. The acting is magnificent. And the production solid. It all comes together to create a very terrifying experience.",9,0,1,30 July 2013
