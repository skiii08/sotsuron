Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Movie trashed by years of expectations
","Main issue with the movie is that it's often boring. Dialogues are wooden, sometimes saved by delivery and craft of the actors. Third act of the movie definitely saves it.",6,1,2,19 December 2019
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," 'A fine addition to my collection'
","Movie that takes obscure idea and somehow manages to be the most competent coherent Star Wars movie that's released by Disney. Ties in the universe without causing much mess, though not without bumbs.",6,0,3,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Glorified mess of a movie
","Movie that delivers amazing ending to a story that begin with the first Star Wars movie, yet fails at almost everything else. It's a fun ride for most of the parts, but compared to previous entries it lacks good movie structure or fresh story.
Predictable yet satisfying. Some characters are getting pushed into background (ekhem, Han Solo ekhem) and serve almost no plot relevance and have no arc.
A movie that seem to be more focused on wrapping things up than delivering meaningful story and seems to be written as an excuse for one very long, amazing sequence.",6,1,2,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Has almost nothing to offer.
","It's a movie that feels like a retcon of previous entry of the franchise, written by someone desperately trying to please the fans with nostalgia, quick story fixes and forcing emotional resonance that wasn't earned and appeared out of thin air. As a result it's an incoherent mess that deliveres only on humour in early stage of the movie - after a while even humour becomes forced to the point the whole project seems like a failed attempt at parody - and starts to be funny in a whole different over-the-top ridiculous way.
Movie juggles with characters forced backstories and motivations, seemingly more out of obligation than a real need to tell a story.
Plot seems to be a monstrous mix of double-what-The-Force-Awakens mainly consisted of - double the coincidence, double the in-your-face exposition and double the bland-interactions-between-the-characters-that-mostly-consists-of-shouting, dialogue that makes the prequels seem like they were written by Shakespeare.
It treats audience members as idiots or people that have severe lack of ability to focus or process information - thus need to be told IN A VERY DIRECT AND LOUD WAY through both visual and sound what is going on, and why characters behave the way they do.
It's similar to Game of Thrones Season 8 finale - it takes a deep drop to the ground level in terms of quality and characters' motivation and coherence, but when in case of Game of Thrones it's 10-storey building jump that has a serious impact, here it's like stepping off the curb - previous entries of the Trilogy has not much to offer either.",3,45,95,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Average movie with painfully overblown romance story
","Phantom Menace, but without Liam Neeson to carry it, and while in Phantom Menace we had a lot of 'boring' here we swap it for 'cringe'.",5,0,1,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Movie that confuses poking you in the eye with a stick with being clever.
","Competent, yet having serious pacing issues. Contradicting setting it takes place in and adding tons of plot holes. Seems to be written by someone who doesn't care about the source material. Extremely edgy tone.
Main issue is how pointless all of the story seems, how tone deaf the movie constantly behaves and that it can't fit into the Saga it is trying to be a part of - seems like a pretentious alternative take on the universe, written by a drunk.",4,6,7,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The most underrated Star Wars movie
","There's an amazing tragic story here, hidden behind clunky dialogue and not that great of an execution. But it makes up for it by some of the acting and a smart, yet messy writing.",7,5,6,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Safe corporate product to deliver nostalgia
","It deliveres on what it is trying to be.
Though plot's a rehash of original Star Wars' plot, but this time almost everything is run by coincidence and galaxy seems to be the size of a small town, judging how easily everyone runs into each other.",5,8,11,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Mystical, darker expansion on original Star Wars, and emotional rollercoaster at the same time.
","This movie is pure magic, grim and mystical compared to it's predecesor. It manages to glue your eyes to the screen with atmosphere and all characters' plots. And that's all I have to say.",9,0,0,19 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Emotional rollercoaster that expands on the story and universe
","This movie is pure magic, grim and mystical compater to it's predecesor.
It manages to glue your eyes to the screen with atmosphere and all characters' plots. And that's all I have to say.",9,0,0,19 December 2019
