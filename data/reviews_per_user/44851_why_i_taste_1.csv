The New World," I was so excited too . . .
","I saw some previews and commercials for this movie and it really looked like it was gonna be a blockbuster. I mean, come on, Indians shooting arrows, hairy Europeans shooting muskets and half naked natives . . . what more could you ask for, right? Wrong!This movie starts off going nowhere and ends up nowhere. There have only been 4 films that were so bad . . . I had to leave in the middle of watching it at the theater and this film is one of them!The other films so bad I had to leave are :<ul><li>From Justin to Kelly - House of Wax - Son of the Mask</li></ul>I am so surprised this film currently has a rating of 7.1! Come on, really? This film has 2 WHOLE scores higher then Pearl Harbour?!?!",1,1,5,14 August 2006
