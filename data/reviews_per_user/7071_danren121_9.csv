The Monuments Men," Should be way better
","This film should be far more engaging than it is. It is about six men selected to retrieve art works stolen by the Nazis, and Bill Murray is in it. That should be enough to make it a near classic. However it never really reaches the comedic or dramatic potential promised in the trailer which is in fact a better experience than the film itself. Part of the reason for this is the lack of momentum caused by the story being spread between the different stories of the cast. Things seem to meander along without a great sense of urgency and as a result the audience may be compelled to feel slightly disinterested. If any art is going to be saved can everyone involved hurry up. Considering the cast and the plot this film could have been allot more fun. The editing itself does not grip the attention. Just one good map reading scene and a couple of arguments between the characters about what they were up against would've made some difference. Instead it sort of ambles and bundles its way towards the end with Matt Damon's contribution more like an extended cameo. Ultimately this film could have been allot better.",6,1,4,3 February 2018
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Loads of Spoilers
","This is a film about a man sent to investigate the identity of a senior member of the British secret service who is in the pocket of the Russians. The film looks great. This is a time before laptops so there is a lot of paperwork, smoking indoors, and suits done up to eleven. The atmosphere of the film is very good. There is a scene where Benedict Cumberbatch retrieves some files. Why he doesn't shove them down his trousers is anyones guess. There is an office party that keeps taking place filmed in what looks like a school hall where the words dress casually have never been muttered. There is also a school that has a very laid back recruitment system that enable's Mark Strong's character agent Jim Prideaux to batter a bird to death in front the class, live in a camper van on site, and allow the pupils to drive his car around on the playing field. Obviously this is a different era when senior intelligence officer's would go and take a dip in a pond on a rainy weekday instead of that swimming pool nonsense. Grime, red buses and telephone boxes, ashtrays, hard liquor, files, neglected corridors and ties are the predominant visual aspects. There is a world weary cynicism that hangs to the garments worn by most of the characters. There is even a scene at the end where an assignation takes place in broad daylight on the grounds of what looks like a school by a man who makes no attempt to disguise his identity. This is a film that really works but also has a lot of aspects that do not resonate with reality.",6,1,1,30 March 2016
Black Mass," A bit on the slow side
","Jimmy (Johnny Depp) and his associates form an Irish American crime syndicate. This film certainly doesn't glorify cold blooded murderous killers, quite the opposite. However what useful information Jimmy actually gives the FBI as an informant isn't entirely clear except one scene where John Connelly (Jimmy's FBI confident played by Joel Egerton) turns up to the office with a load of snaps of Jimmy's rival gangster clan hanging out. The film looks great but the audience never really get to know any of the characters. Towards the latter stages of the film Joel Egerton acts every scene as if he's on his fifth shot of whiskey which is mainly caused by the introduction of an FBI investigator keen to pursue Jimmy's criminal activities. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Jimmy's brother, who is also the state senator. After the perimeter's of the film have been established the pace slows and a scene by a beach that caused me to hope there would be a tsunami was a reminder the action was on gangster movie cruise control.",7,2,2,10 December 2015
Oblivion," Interesting
","OK. A giant upside down pyramid decides to pool earth's resources together for its survival, and uses the clones of a couple of astronauts it kidnapped in outer space to run the daily chores of world domination, whilst convincing these astronauts they're acting in their own interests by concocting a story involving scavs and a eventual refuge in a place called Titan. (Naughty pyramid.)(Titan was a moon the astronauts were originally investing, ahh..)The opening hour of the film is well directed and engaging. Its only when a space craft carrying the sleeping passengers of the original mission (Investigating Titan) is intercepted by Cruise that the lid on his past is lifted. (But intercepted originally by the scavs who are really humans who want to defeat Tet.) He ultimately discovers he is a clone but the memories he retains enable a relationship with his wife (who was on the original mission too but got cut loose upon being detected by Tet - where the pyramid lives.)Trying to keep hold of a wriggling fish feels an apt analogy for the plot. The opening premise is quite promising, there is a day in the life of a star trooper feel as the daily maintenance of North America is carried out. The survivors are an honest bunch, but come under attack by three drones when they open the doors. What they survive on is perhaps not addressed, so we have to assume its snow and baked beans. Morgan Freeman sort of gets his wish to see 'the look on its face' when the bomb detonates but his emergence from the capsule surely must have been tempered with a little disappointment when he finds himself facing a huge inanimate triangle.",7,1,2,17 November 2013
Bird Box," The ending, not so good
","A mass epidemic of some kind breaks out whereby a nebulous entity is manifest in the air which effects people's behaviour dramatically when they look at it; unless you are inside a house or a building with the blinds down in which case the malevolent entity cannot reach you. Still there? Yeah don't know if the film's producers were when the premise was read out. They were probably as bothered about the plot as John Malkovich appears to be about his wife who gets into a burning car, he has a moan for a few minutes and then moves on. When the children end up in the tumultuous rapids one is safely deposited on the shore the other a rock. As the lawyer in South Park exclaims to a bemused Jury, 'that does not make any sense!' The films ending is what didn't quite stick. It just doesn't really add up. Where do they get their food, what is it supposed to be? A utopia? And what's with the bird in the box? So the birds get flappy when danger approaches, so why go to the school?",6,1,3,23 December 2018
The Revenant," A film that looks great but ...
","This film takes to long to reach the end, and when it does you have to wonder if you really care that it did. It begins brilliantly. The landscape is stunning and the attempt at conveying mayhem through a style of cinematography akin to realism makes the action sequences real spectacles. There is a breathless energy to the opening half hour. Its just when the plot is established it simply begins to feel laboured and predictable. The locations are visually stunning and it was this aspect of the film that I found most engaging. Your enjoyment of the film really depends on your capacity to be interested in the principle theme which is revenge. Once the fuse has been lit for this eventual outcome it just seems to go through the motions until this is finally realised. Overall the film looks great it just takes to long to reveal to little.",7,12,22,16 January 2016
La La Land," Lala indeed
","The opening scene features a women singing to the camera whilst sitting in a traffic jam, however it really looks as though she is miming which in a way is quite fitting because after all the film is called lala land and in many ways the makers of this one had carte blanche when it came to putting it together. The best thing beside the walking baselines in the soundtrack are probably the references to the 1950s Hollywood cinema as the whole spectacle is very much a self addressed cinematic love letter. The aesthetic is pleasing, but this is all form and no substance, if you want to see something truly unoriginal then you should give this a try. Really this is like watching a computer game trailer for a classic movie.",6,1,2,3 February 2018
Moonrise Kingdom," Not just an awesome trailer
",Having seen the trailer I was sure that I would be in for a film that looked great but maybe at the expense of actual substance. However the characters and script are brilliant and the plot doesn't stray one bit. The running time is just about right as one of the film's strongest points is that it doesn't overcook anything meaning the comedic value and drama are not overstated. The other facet of the film's quality is the soundtrack which really imbues the film with the era in which it is set. It's actually quite annoying that the review has to be ten lines long as I have included everything that I feel relevant already and would rather have ended the review in the previous sentence as opposed to the one that I am writing now as I feel this is fault that should at some point in the future be rectified by whoever sanctions these reviews.,Null,1,1,14 January 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," No plot spoilers
","Water is a scarce resource so when it is dispensed and made available to the populace it is by opening a valve of some sort that allows it to cascade from a cliff face and down onto an arid dry dessert floor bed. Some people have cups, mugs and buckets to catch it in, so hey it's not a total waste. We see some water in the film, but no sign of food apart from the two headed mutant lizard Mad Max stamps on and eats, there really isn't any implication of how anyone gets a meal in a dessert with no water and the occasional lizard or bug. Despite this there is a demigod like figure who is worshipped by a populace of thousands. Not really the every man for himself, dog eat dog world of the future one may have been expecting then.And as for where the gasoline is coming from, well what does that matter, even though oil was the principle cause for conflict in all previous films as it was the most valuable commodity it's not even an issue here even though it's the stuff that sustains the film's entire action sequence.The flashbacks imply Mad Max's past, we see them at the beginning when he's being pursued by some sort of dance troupe in make up, or the bad guys. What the dessert lack's in water is compensated by a tremendous amount of white powder and dark eyeliner. But really the film just becomes very monotonous and even giving the film this amount of attention is quite undeserving of the film itself.",1,108,218,29 May 2015
