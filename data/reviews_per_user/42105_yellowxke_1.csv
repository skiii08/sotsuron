Black Swan," Psychologically frightening
","Black Swan is a complicated movie that has numerous issues that I believe can by psychologically damaging to many persons. I am a 'shrink' who has worked with patients for over 20 years and have found that persons who are emotionally fragile can be re-traumatized from movie scenes like many in Black Swan. The graphic scenes of emotional and sexual abuse, eating disorders, delusions, attempted murder and self-mutilation are so disturbing I need to label them psychotic. Persons who have a tendency to disassociate and/or have Post Traumatic Stress Disorder should NOT see this movie. I know this movie is headed to the Oscars and has critical merit, however it has so many negative aspects to it, I URGE you NOT to see it. I fear many will have severe nightmares and a great deal of trauma, or much worse, if they see it. Please talk to your therapist before seeing Black Swan.",1,31,56,7 January 2011
