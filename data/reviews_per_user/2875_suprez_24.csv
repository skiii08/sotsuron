The Incredible Hulk," Great action packed movie
","After reading some of the haters in the first page , i decided to give it a 10 and only comment about the positive of this movie.First , this is hulk . The green behemoth . It's not a hard-thinking story . It's a popcorn movie with big stunt.If you enter in the cinema you will see what you expected . It's Hulk after all .The sequence of action are awesome.Worth spending your little 10 dollars to see that on a big screen.Don't think like the hater.They probably comment on every cgi movie of how bad they think they are.If you love this movie and you're older than 10 years.Trust me it's normal .. It's internet here . Don't listen to the hater.The acting is great . Hulk he's hulk .Green huge and powerful . Hulk it's about action and brute sheer streng. Not about some emo teenager gaining power and trying to find their place in society.That it",10,3,8,13 June 2008
The Ring," You don't expect much . You end up sleeping with the light on
","Some Friday night.We decided to go watch a movie at our local theater.Without much option left , we decided to take a risk and we picked THE RING.When the movie started , none of us was expecting much.The movie was recent and we're not the kind of peaple to read critic and review before.The Movie started and like everyone . We had already prejudice before the first image.Thinking it's was again some kind of movie with a lot of nudity mixed with blood and scream(don't forget the cat).I'm not a fan of horror movie , because horror movie are the close parent of porn movie.Most of the time empty of storyline.The first scene give you already the cill , even if you expect her fates to happens , you don't expect the way she die.Curiously there's no blood.Just a tortured face of a teenager.Tortured by Fear.The reaction of her parents give you the chill.THinking to ourself , what she have seen?The first image was enough to make me tremble . Have we discovered a horror movie actually giving us reel horror and not surtaxing us with blood and scream?This movie from the first scene to the last build up the fear of knowing what these peaple must see before dying.Watching this movie at 00:00 alones at home really could scare the more brave viril man.It's not about believing or not.It's really about giving you the feel of what horror could really be.So far we've seen a load of movie trying to copy the RING.But they failed.Also . Tortured Kid and demoniac children really work on us Adult.GIvinh us fear and chill.Children are the symbol of innocence.When they start acting the opposite , we really start pissing in your pants.The Ring with The first Exorcist are really the movie that i would classify into HORROR.",10,1,2,18 August 2007
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," We have to understand E.T
","Before E.T Most of the movie involving Aliens was about them invading our planet.Most of ugly creature were portrayed violent and evil creature.Than come A Charismatic Aliens.That what E.T is .The acting and everything is superb into this movie.The Story . The Friendship between a little boy and a Aliens.This was never shown before on a screen.Everything was against Steven.The Odd was not on his side.When i was young (3-4 yearsold) and i watched E.T . I was scared of E.T . My mother told me i even cried .E.T for me was just another evil creature because he was Ugly .I watched it again at 10 years old and i fell in love with E.T . I understand why E.T was so popular , why it's a masterpiece.Everyone know about E.T.It's the movie you have to re-watch and re-watch again.It's never get old and will never get old.How can someone hate E.T?If you hate E.T you're not Human",10,0,1,21 August 2007
Terminator Salvation," They try ed but Failed
","Everyone remember the epic beginning of Terminator 2 . Unstopabble T-800 walking toward the resistance , firing laser ... with human struggling for their survival .Trying to stop such overwhelming force.Now the robot don't fire pulse rifle.But old decrepit machine gun and yet they can't aim.Now what we get?A Movie that look very similar to the video game Fallout 3 . The Terminator T-600 reminded me of the super mutant in Fallout 3.Walking very slowly and very dumb .Using canon rifle but looking like they can't aim.Trying to find straggler in town ...Geez ..Even though they are robot using assisted targeted system.They just can't frigging aim.Or huge Robot ship that can be destroyed by a little Ball of steel.Where was the Crull cracking?The Techno apocalypse Music?The Sound of Metal?Nothing.Absolutely nothing.The acting was very vague.The best acting was actually Marcus .Bale seemed to be constipated during the whole movie.T2 remind my favorite movie of all time..Because it's gave us a vision of the post-apocalypse war between human and robot.Now this movie seemed like a rat chase more than a war.Remember how bad ass was Arny in T-2?Imagine 1000 of them advancing toward your camp.That would be a frigging Nightmare no? The T-800 in the movie .. I remember the T-800 being super bad ass.A John Connor in front of ARNY would not survive longer than 4 sec.Unless COnnor used some kind of super High-tech weaponry.Well .. They just use old decrepit gun.It's was not a *good* T-800 this time with no intention of killing.But a machine who had to kill John Connor.Yet he walk slowly toward him and give the poor Connor enough time to do whatever he want.He just throw him around and walk very slowy toward him.I don't see that intention of killing.Personnaly i would have made this movie in the era of the t-800 and the human struggling fighting them.Not some cat and mouse game.The first 30 minutes was fine.But after that .. it's go downward and fall into mess.The story has potential.But the atmosphere and the bad ass robot was not here.",5,2,5,24 June 2009
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Not for everyone
",Il be honest . I rented this movie only because of Johnhy Depp.It's also only because of Johnny Depp that this movie feel so great for many people.Without him it's would in my opinions. Be just another annoying musical movie that you would never watch again . At the middle of the movie.I was yawning and more concentrated about how much time was left to finish it so i could do something else.Sure some people told me .. How i could not like this movie?Because it's was boring ? Because i hate musical movie? i prefeer musical theater than movie .. I just don't know.It's was bloody and creepy .. sure . But the movie was just boring and the creepy romance annoyed me.The Gore was more funny than creepy actually . This movie just seemed fake .People think or try to find inspiration in dull thing.What might be unique or disturbing or boring might be awesome.But a movie that pump your adrenaline and show nice chick it's boring?To each is taste.I go watch again the incredible Hulk at the cinema . At least it's was what i want from a movie.A movie and not a theater inside a t.v.,3,0,2,22 June 2008
The Godfather: Part II," How to rate such a movie?
","After reading a good portion of comments here.I'm truly sorry . This movie was not great enough .It's maybe the high expectation i had from it , seeing that everyone seem to ejaculate when they think about the godfather movie.Have seen some people falling asleep during this movie.But the movie is good!Because it's the GODFATHER! LOLIt's could be because the version i watched had no sub-tittle.With all the Italian conversation in this movie(which is around 30% of the movie) i could barely not fall asleep being i don't understand Italian and i had no sub-tittle.It's sure does not help.The acting is superb .But the role don't seem to be much complicated to play.Everyone keep telling me that this movie is the best.But what make a movie the best?The acting?The story?The Action?I'm quite happy godfather 2 for me was boring.I'm an intelligent person that most of the time enjoy great story.But this movie just seem to give retard a reason that they are indeed intelligent and love great movie.I LOVE THE GODFATHER SO I LOVE GOOD MOVIE WOWOWO.When i watch a movie.I want to have some show and not some chatting during 2 hours and pretend that i love this kind of movie because the *acting is superb*.Give me a freaking break.Ace Venture it's a stupid movie.But at least it's entertainingThe music is also over-used.I was quite tired to hear the same background music each frigging time just because they want to enhance the *emotion*.",6,3,13,19 September 2007
Knowing," The good the bad and the horrible
","Let's start by the horrible.<ul><li>The Children . First of all they were not believable at all.The lead kid seemed cold-hearted and not once , i believed in his acting.To the scene he watch a old video of her mother , to the final scene where he dance in paradise island with the other kids.Don't forget he's named Caleb.Wooah.You still follow me?</li></ul>-The Aliens We don't know anything about them.Where they come from , who they're and why they want to save us.They love us enough to watch over us .But they only care about 2 little kids and no one else (oh and 2 bunny also) . OK so we see many different spaceship.But we all guessed it.It's probably some piranha and red fish.Or Maybe a apple tree?How they inform us about the end of the world?Talk in the head of some children and freak their parent out.Take the time to predict every damn catastrophe with a code on paper but they can't predict a way to save us?The Father can't follow them because well .. he can't decipher the sign?What sign?Anyway.They find for the little brat a nice .. sorry a very nice looking planet.Just for them!!The other human aren't worth that place!Because it's Paradise island! Just throw them here and they will dance happily in the herb while flaterring the super bunny of doom! The end-The end ... Cliché cliché and cliché.The brute and selfish human pillaging everything before they all burn.The Children dancing in paradise island while the earth is burn and everything they ever believed in or cared about don't exist anymore(Don't forget the bunny). But eh they're happy now!!! Also how their children will procreate?Do you picture what i'm saying?The end reminded me a lot of that movie with the meteor..It's so cliché.Also why they always need to show New-York getting destroyed?Why not the amazonia?Why not the Ocean?Why not our forest?Noooo.Because our skyscraper are so important!!Why not the first sign of the sun ray blasting through the ozone and after the whole planet burning?The lead female 's so stupid.But if we go in my little cave we will survive!! Even though her death was predicted ..WoW...The end prob just melodramatic for the poor New-Yorkains.My Poor Madisan Square Garden! Ohhh Noo!Don't forget that the president is safe!!He will rule the world after the apocalypse and currently hide in nuclear bunker!The bad ... The last 25 minutes.The good .. The first 40 minutes(Until the subway crash)The lead female character was only there for ... i don't know why exactly.She was just horrible and she was annoying like Hell.Although i don't blame her.The movie went downhill after the subway crash.I loved it .. but than it's just was so terrible.When you put all the piece together you realize how bad the movie was.But we watch movie to be entertained right?This movie do the job right but it's still stupid. filled with no sense and cliché.",7,1,3,26 June 2009
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," my English ain't good but this movie was
","I'm 29 now.I still remember when i have witnessed this movie at the theater with my dad,mom and sister.After the flick we went to a restaurant and all we did was talking about terminator 2 and how awesome it's was.My father who was not a film enthusiast liked it very much.I think i've seen this flick well over 200 time.Around 100 time the first years and 100 more time until now.My uncle kept me for 1 week at some point and he had to throw me outside because all i was doing was watching terminator 2.It's was my *movie* .So why there's no more movie like this one?Well after all those years i realized why.Because the action and the story aren't trying to link themselves to much.You never know what's going to happens because they don't elaborate anything.They don't make a plan to how they should take over Cyberdine.John don't think about what he should do when the terminator attack him.We're always amazed because they don't strategies 10 minutes before doing it.They just do it and it's flow so well.It's does not impact the story line and it's give plenty of time for it while leaving the action apart from the rest.So each action scene just link together and all you can do it WOOO AMAZING,AWESOME.Even after so many years .. the action scene never get hold.Because you don't have to go through anything before it.They're just here and it's give a real atmosphere to the movie has a whole.Just like when Sarah try to escape.She don't think the how of the when.She just want to get the hell out of there.Action flick today try to hard with all the strategy etc.So it's become stagnant and you're just waiting for what you expect.It's become boring.Not many movie equal terminator 2.It's my favorite movie of all time for that simple reason.Because the action and the story .. are just 2 movie in 1.",10,5,7,5 June 2009
Independence Day," What can we expect from such a Tittle?
","This movie is entertaining.The humor of Will Smith never get old even if sometime you wonder if it's not him the aliens.Movie like this are often making the individual some god-like fighter saving the entire planet.Escaping all the ennemy attack and laughing about it.The Earth is collapsing but let's kick some aliens Butts!I'm Will smith! We see the Aliens has Powerful , Ruthless and imprevisible being.But all it's take to shut down the menace it's Will smith with his partner riding to the space onboard a aliens ship( on the firs try he can pilots it) I stop right here.When you can't believe in the story you know it's a sci-fiction movie.When you can't believe in the character you know it's a shitty movie.When both are mixed you know it's American .THis movie is like a little box of chocolate you hurry to open but after it's open it's just taste like chocolate.Nothing new , nothing fresh .All it's take it's some savior.If you want to watch a movie where you really feel that us human everywhere in the world are really nothing important compared to the invader.Watch War of the World.Independence day it's a movie good with popcorn.But after the popcorn bag is empty , it's not worth watching anymore.Since only the pop corn taste something.",6,1,3,18 August 2007
District 9," It's was supposed to be
","The most *reaslistic* sci-fiction movie of all time. This contains spoiler so stop reading.What i loved in this movie .It's the simple fact that the extra-terrestrial are that .. They don't try to befriend us or reveal their secret . They just want to go back home! Because obviously .. The mother ship module haven't been discovered and only an independent society manage the E.T and dumped them in a slump beneath the mother ship.Probably because they're ugly and eat cat food.Who know.The superpower don't care about them ... leave the Africans gangster cannibals deal with them and eat them.I loved this movie .. But i'm gonna talk about what i disliked. First why our hero .. call his wife with a cell phone?Yeah he stole it.But come on.Everyone know today how cell phone work.Also a stolen cell phone will work for several day .. Whatever .Everyone seem to understand the extra-terrestrial languages .. For some mysterious reason .. But they can't talk it..For some mysterious reason.So they give them American name ... For some mysterious reason(Even though it's in Africa)The mysterious Fuel bottle that transformed our hero.His Kept in a building with minimal surveillance and protected by a simple .. glass box.The E.T accept their live condition .. They just want to go home and survive.Who know.They're extra-terrestrial so they're not like us.Us the Evil human who do anything to be respected and feared!My Porsche own by the way.Everyone know that the media are controlled.But this movie felt like a big media tour that tell us how evil we're .. That every government only care about profit and weaponry(Not in this movie , because the government don't care at all) .. No one care about the poor aliens because we're like this.It's true we tend to be scared of what we don't understand.They don't understand the aliens .. so they reject them.The human only care about their good fortune.Who care if the world burn .. If i have a roof and my H.D T.V i'm alright .. has i feed on the media and believe everything they're telling me.This kind of movie remind me how bad our society's .. We're far from being perfect.But let's start with yourself and worry about the next guy later .Yes lot of plot-holes and non-sens in this movie.But i still enjoyed it.",9,2,4,24 August 2009
X-Men: The Last Stand," Fast movie
",The big problem with this movie it's the fact that you're left with a sensation of emptiness.When the movie end.You have already forgotten most of it.Or you don't feel like talking about it.When someone will ask you about X-Men 3.You will probably say . - Yeah that *part* was good.That was cool!THis is bad because the story was well put .But because of how the character are introduced and developed you really feel abandoned.A lot of important character lose their power during this movie or just plain die. It's would have been easier to accept if not everything was thrown inside one.Everything go fast.You just don't dispatch important character quick like thisAt the end of the movie you're already thinking . What? It's already the end?Sometime it's a sign of a great movie.The Movie is pretty fun regardless.But it's simply not one of these movie that you talk about 1-2 hours with friend after viewing it eating a good dinner.You will remember 1-2 part They should just have mentioned to us directly that they don't want to continue the movie sequence.THis movie is better if you watch it right after the 2 other.It's might not leave a sensation of emptiness.But when you wait 2-3 years for this.You feel abandoned by the production,6,1,2,18 August 2007
The Mist," The end made this movie bleh.
","I'm not the kind of guy that research only movie with good ending.But why the urge of killing yourself and other after so many struggle?Lack of intelligence?I would certainly not think it would be everywhere on earth.It's started at the local military base so you assume that not everywhere were invaded but only the selected area.I guessed the end and it's happened.After he killed everyone , a tank appear.To dramatic for my taste.Maybe if they waited a couple of hours or at least made an attempt outside the car but no.If the car were attacked by 1000 super blood sucker than yes.I for sure would never agreed to be killed when you don't KNOW on WHAT scale this invasion of *bug* is.It's was also only creature.Not super alien with spaceship and laser.So you guess that the army can handle such a situation with military equipment and do not panic.I'm certainly someone that don't panic.I also finished (funny) the video game half-life 2 a couple of day ago.The *portal thing* and the invasion.BTW does the military lab was black Mesa?But at least in Half-life . The invader were more than creature.The Fanatic acting was brilliant because myself i was getting really tired to hear her prank during the movie. I for sure would had tie her and send her into a pit before crowd became brainwashed by her.We also don't have much answer of the size of the crisis.Which leave the movie with a big hole.But by judging you know it's was simply in this area , since the army went directly there.I also think too much time was dedicated to that prankster.I think without the fanatic the movie would have been better.",6,0,3,25 March 2008
I Am Legend," Great movie
","It's was one of the best apocalypse movie i have ever seen.It's the story of a doctor who think he's the sole survivor after a virus hit the humanity .He work hard to find a cure and find quite strange hobby to kill time.Like flirting with a mannequin.The attachment also displayed for his dog.Being the only *normal* living companion he still have.The people affected aren't zombie.Nor they are undead.They are simply affected.The character development s well enough.I got tired to read some know it all 13 years old crying no character development when they have no idea of what they are talking about.The movie was not made to tell us what Smith love to cook.The sole purpose was to feel how it would be if we were alone.I did feel sorry for him.Will showed a great performance showing us , how we could feel at his place.The scene with his dog was painful.For someone like me that love dog and having to kill your only remaining companions would destroy me.The claustrophobic feel when he have to confront the affected and search for his dog.You really feel like him.But what it would be without my dog? The affected are computer generated.The only thing that amaze me.Each time you're affected you become superhumanly strong and agile.Would not it be the opposite?Sick slow and weak?Now you can go and rant how this movie ain't perfect or don't suit your taste.Your personal opinions should never be used to rant about a movie in general.I hate the movie titanic.But i can see why it's a great movie in general.Rant off",10,0,2,6 January 2008
The Hurt Locker," Good movie but not a documentary
","Reading through some review here and some ex-soldier yelling out loud that this movie was bad , because it's not close to reality.Well guess what , it's a movie not a documentary.Some scene was added exactly because of that reason.The actor performed well.I really enjoyed the prestation of the black guy(forgot his name) . The specialist reminded me a lot of my ex companions.You wonder how the hell they never panic and never show any emotion or fear , but they're the first to understand you when yourself panic and always remain calm .You never know how ya would react to some death situation.Fact is.No one can really explain it.How human being can be so cruel and warmonger among each other.It's like a drug and a reason to live for some.How they're educated and raised by their parents/siblings.If you were one of those people watching the EOD disarming the bomb.Would you blame them?Whom risk their life to disarm it?Or would you simply think the reason there's bomb after all it's because of those same people trying to disarm the bomb?Or for who they work? The scene in the grocery shop was very well done.It's give that sensation that everything's so easy in America.Children died from starvation,violence and are used has human bomb in other countries.We know it , but we claim we can't do anything about it.We live in a difficult and weird world with all kind of problem.We simply close our eyes .... What can i really do?Go to Irak and anger ppl who will put more of those?Or do nothing and complain about the situation in other countries? This movie deliver well this message . We're just human with limited capacity.But we can start with the closer one before attempting to disarm a bomb in Irak.",7,2,8,5 July 2009
Transformers," Average Movie with a High budget
","How to describe this movie?.When you start watching this movie and the attack of the the military base begin.THis is indeed spectacular ! You really think - They are super powerful . Be ready for a disappointments.In this scene.The Decepticon completely own the human.Giving really you the chill that they are bad ass.But more we advance in the movie and more you feel they are just cheap Terminator bigger version.For example Magatron.In the comic he can blow out a complete city but he can't reach a 17 y o little human running away with the famous all spark.Megatron have to ask him! Can you believe that?Megatron . The doom of Cybertron ask the 17 yo punk the box.He don't attack him .No ,no,no !He ask him gently - Give me the all spark little punk! He's indeed Powerful.. no?This is how you feel when you watch the Transformers.Not to mention how it's seem quite easy to destroy them.At the beginning they seem invulnerable.But by the end, a little human can dispatch one with one shot sliding over him.OK .. You get it right?The acting and the dialogs was ... poor.The Auto-bot want to protect the human but don't care about the protection of them-self.They are just machine after all.These robot have been friend for millions of years but that OK dying for the sake of human who are still considered chimpanzee by the norm of the universe.You really don't believe in this.Simply because there's almost no character development in the Transformers.It's just a shoot-em-all. Like Rambo with better graphic.Mister teen Sam suddenly become a super brave soldier and give directive to the army.Hell yeah , We all know that a teen would be given the fate of this world on his bare hand . Why do we have army , scientist and powerful organization when a teen can do it all?When Optimus Prime said to Sam *You saved my life* .That when i started crying.My friend close to me started to cry also and we both laughed.Without mister 17 year old this world would be doomed.Not to mention how the robot are supposed just to give away their life for the chimpanzee since the start,But Optimus Prime got saved by the 17 yo little punk.He have to be grateful.That OK if so many civilians die during the city fight.That a lot of military die .That a lot of Auto-bot die.Because Little Sam is the boss here since he carry the all-Spark.We have to give the credit that he escaped a 50 ft tall robot who's considered the most cruel evil and powerful robot of the universe.Who was there for millions of years and rage war everywhere in the universe.SUper Teenager is here! You just can't believe everything.Even the story is unbelievable.It's so badly shaped.The girl that Sam love is indeed a super mid 20's top-model.She's Wise and perfect looking.I'm sorry but when i was 17.Girl of my class were not shaped like some mid 20's top model woman with the brain of Einsteins and the courage of James Bond.SPOILER A 17 yo guy standing by a 50,000$ sport car kissing that supposedly normal girlfriends teenagers was really the end that we wanted.Not only the robot surround him.The government don't care about them.The teen have the control.Sam got the Powah.I hear the beat in my head.OK , it's a sci-fiction movie after all.Don't you agree?The action is intense and the robot are well done.That all i think off when i think about what i enjoyed about this movie. If you want to see a movie with actually a story and a normal human that face the reality of this world.Go watch Spiderman III . You watch the Transformer for the special effect.That it.It's was like watching the same plot of Hercule in New-York using 150 Millions of Budget",3,1,4,18 August 2007
The Evil Dead," The craziest movie ever made
","Just for the fact of watching this movie you start thinking you're a psycho.THis movie was banned into several country and the uncut version took 20 years to come at our screen.Most of us haven't watched this movie in 1980 but more in the 90's when a cut version was released.This movie is sick , violents.You somehow ponder how the director could come with such nasty idea of violence .With low budget they managed to build such a nasty atmosphere.Especially the tree rape.That just plain gross.The production of this movie lasted 2 years out of a budget of 300.000 dollars ( and not 50 000 like someone said.There's a limit for stupidity) Most of the cast had left before the end of the production.Why do they left?The movie was for most of them impposible for any success.Because of the violence put into it.Only the main actor managed to stay till the end .THis movie is just disturbing.They really tried everything to make violence gore and sadism put at the maximum limit.When you watch The Evil dead you have to throw away your humanity for 90 minutes.",10,1,2,20 August 2007
Clash of the Titans," Awful
","A remake of my favourite childhood movie.Clash of the titan.The original movie , outside of the special effect was not very plot-driven . But it's was enough to amaze my child eyes.Some day i started to read about Greek mythology.I had a dictionnary that explained everything(A gift from my sister) . This movie like the original , barely follow the original myth.But unlike this remake , the original had a 'mystic' feel to it.The acting was very bad . But can't really blame them.The movie ain't very long but seem even shorter.No , no . It's not because the movie's awesome.You think something will happens.The story might progress you keep asking yourself.Because there's absolutely ZERO character development. You start to think that maybe you're dumb and you don't understand something.But at the end at the final scene with the king of the god .. Than you let's out a big huge noisy sight and you walk out of the theater and regret those 15.00 buck wasted .TIt's sad . Because there's so much potential to create epic story with Greek mythololy and that what they do with a huge budget.If Zeus could see this movie . We would hear him laughing and we might deserve to be screwed by the Kraken ;) .",4,4,5,14 April 2010
The Happening," I really tried
",Before watching the happening . I had to read some review.Since most of them were bad.I told myself .It's imbh anyway . You can't really trust all those people reviewing something from their computer screen.But after 20 minutes . I know this was really a bad movie.I did not get the role of the GF of our hero . I was really pondering the question .What she's doing and why she's so stupid . All the dialog between her and him are pathetic .I though maybe i was too dumb to understand the meaning between him and her.Or that she was just a psycho.But at the end.It's was just the screenplay that was horrible and had no meaning at all.At some point during a drama scene . You could see a children smirking behind . Trying desperately to look scared .But she was just looking like someone trying to look scared .So again i pondered the question if there was any direction for the actor and the other less important role.Actually .. There was no direction for the figurant and probably close to none for the actor.It's was pitiful to watch .I wonder if the actor them self know what they were doing.A lot of cliché.I'm so tired of the good ol cliché of old woman completely out of their mind simply because they have some wallpaper of Jesus.Do you get the picture?Or some plant lover that first are considered psycho but end up telling the truth.That so overused.i laughed when the gf of the protagonist did a crazy gesture pointing at the plant lover old man.At this point i was like.I though she was the one completely crazy.Because each word coming from her mouth was completely crazy and made no sense at all.This movie is a big failure mostly because of the screenplay.,5,5,10,6 July 2008
The Departed," Brilliant Movie .
","Be warned before you decide to watch this movie.Personnaly i'm not a big fan of such movie.Which most of the time , are popular among teenager seeking violence with lot of cursing since they think it's cool . Lot of material in this movie that can shock people.Especially with such great acting.What made this movie so enjoyable?The Acting.The plot . The brilliant direction . I know it's been said a bazillion of time already . But there's some scene where you really feel for the protagonist.For example when Dicaprio is interrogated by Walberg.Both of them are just genial in that scene.You really feel the anger and the pressure of Dicaprio , while you really feel Walberg is toying with his emotion.Dicaprio face turning red because of pressure.You just know how he was feeling.Such brilliant acting and performance.That just hallucinating Feeling the same has Dicaprio.Wanting myself to go inside the T.V and kick Walberg ass .I'm no big fan of Walhberg.But you have to give credit when it's due.He did a terrific performance.Everyone did a terrific performance.THis movie is so exciting.You don't have a clue of how it's will end.Everything happens when you don't think.This movie is a bomb.There's no cliché in this movie.There's no guy who can decimate an entire group of enemy.There's no superheroes .There's no super car chase and super explosion.No , there's just people trying to survive",8,0,1,24 August 2007
War of the Worlds," Underrated Movie
","I loved this movie . Tom Cruise was splendid . It's about a man who want to survive the invasion of aliens on Earth.Don't want to be a hero , he just want to survive.It's remind me of the movie the pianist . Where all he care about it's his own survival.I hear a lot of complaining about the bacteria killing every aliens.Hollywood lack originality?Maybe.I also don't know why this film got the same rating than Independence day.Which i think was , a far worse movie.What i disliked.Well first the aliens . Why they always have to look scary and disgusting?Because they're bad?Because we're good? Let's me tell you , you would not recognize a murderer on the street.He would not look more ugly or scary than someone ordinary.This is why children taking role of evil being are very scary.Because children should be innocent being and not the reincarnation of Satan.The bacteria cliché.Well how a super advanced extra-terrestrial race going to lose?Please find me something to put on my script because i want to know.The whole shield is getting old.The aliens don't know how to strategize their offense/defense.Who care!They have shield protecting them and the second you know how to drop their shield down .. you have won!(independence day) But in this movie it's fine.Because it's was not a computer virus or Will Smith six pack that saved the world with the USA flag floating behind him .. Sure it's cliché and you think the aliens would have figured it out.But eh , the human have to win.Also the American were not the savior Don't you agree?They were just human like every other race and wanted to survive.This movie was great.Much better than independence day.So why only 6.6? Unknown.Eh i have come to a solution.The best solution that the human species would survive a extra-terretrial invasion it's being saved by another extra-terrestrial race.Leave me alone with bacteria and macintosh uploading a virus.",10,3,5,4 July 2009
30 Days of Night," dissapointement
","This movie spare us all of where the vampire came from.But they did not spare us of their bloodthirsty instinct and scream.OK they are vampire but they don't really have to be so retarded?Why scream and look retarded each time they want to drink your blood?Vampire in this movie have the brain power of my chiwawa.Or that vampire with the blood on his face.OK they are vampire but do they shave?i know if i was a vampire i would shave that blood off my sexy face.The acting was pathethic.I just could not believe him in every situation he was put.And all the little input of the vampire boss was kinda pathethic.A vampire hundred of years old (apparently) got pwned by a newborn vampire.Yet, when the vampire fight the other civilians they look superhumanly agile and strong.But when they fought our hero they are .. normal.Also the chick saying - i should never have quit you.I almost got a tears here*NO*.The script was horrible.In the last decade since Dracula from bram stocker haven't seen any vampire movie worth buying .Vampire are immortal and suck human blood . But that does not mean they have to be retard",4,0,3,6 January 2008
Iron Man," Predictable . But what can you expect!!!!!!!
","French guy From Montreal salute you!I have watched so many movies in my life.Since 1980, i have lost the count of them.Iron man, if you don't already know .It's the story of a genius called Clark .After he's kidnapped choose a new path . Instead of creating weapon that can fall in the hand of bad guy.He decide to devote his *second life* to protect good.Nothing new here.I have lost the count of movie,book or video game with good guy fighting evil.But this is what people love.Everyone want to be identified has a Hero.Be it a fire-worker or a POLICEMAN or superhero that can fly with superpower .If your girlfriend lose something important to her ! You will be happy to be her HERO and find it! :)Before you go watch HERO movie you know 2 crucial thing . 1:The Hero will defeat the bad guy 2:There's always a superwoman with long leg falling in love with the Hero.The Chick does fall in love with the Hero.But at least it's does not turn into a cheap Harlequin romance.Something that i appreciated. I'm quite tired of the *I always loved you* *blablabla* *kiss kiss* * sex sex* Leave the cheap romance and work on the HERO aspect of the movie.They did it correctly.The CGI are overused today and everyone will agree with me.It's easier to accept when you watch a HERO movie.When the CGI is used in IRON MAN.It's used correctly.The big *robot* don't look real.But does that make so much difference?I'm not here to believe what i'm seeing.I'm here to have fun.It's just when they cross that barrier and simply overuse it.Than , the movie turn into an anime movie.Thanks god it's was not the case with Iron man.I have never read IRON man . But i know there's difference between the two.It's was in Vietnam and not in Afghanistan that Clark was kidnapped.But when Iron man was created.It's was during the Vietnam War.So you understand why they choose Afghanistan.The base of the plot is still intact.So the fan i'm pretty sure will be pleased.The Movie is predictable but every super-hero movie is predictable.The HERO win the first big fight and at the end decide he will continue.I don't even know if it's a spoiler or not.If you're angry because i spoiled something.You really have to watch more movie.If you think the movie was predictable.YOU HAVE WATCHED A SUPERHERO MOVIE.What did you expect?",10,2,8,5 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Epic adventure begin!
","THis is the *ADVENTURE* of the 80's.Just like Lord Of the ring is the adventure of the 2000-2010's.I remember when the theme song started.I was so excited.I know i was ready for star wars.Ready for a truly epic tale with charismatic character.This is the kind of movie you watch 3 time in one days and you still talk about it.The Kind of movie that make you feel good after watching it.For day to come after watching Star wars you just talk about star wars.The acting was not perfect.But the character are so charismatic that you forget about the bad acting sequence .You forget that you watch a movie . That what an adventure should be.The first time i watched this movie i was 8 years old in the middle of 80's.The Movie was still one of the best special effect still of the time.My parents wanted me to watch it . They told me , son we have seen it several time.But guess what?I watched it 4 time that day and my parents also.After this , my parents went to to video club and came back with the 2 others.Than i watched the three movie three time in a week end.It's was one of the few time my parents did not throw me outside and let me watch the TV all of the week end.THis movie never get old.Even in 70 years this movie will still be watched by the son of your son.THis is just the *MOVIE*. You just can't say any bad thing about star wars.If you say a bad thing about star wars. You just don't understand what a tale is.",10,1,3,19 August 2007
300," What can you expect?
","This is the kind of film you watch and at the end you think to yourself - THAT what i CALL a MOVIE . Don't expect much character development or hyped tender romance coming directly from the mouth of a emotional disturbed 16 years old girl seeing love everywhere.The spartan are over stereotyped has they seem coming directly from a Bodybuilding contest.This movie is about a battle .The enemies are brutal and violent and seem to be mindless slave of the god-king . WHile the spartan are forged since young age for battle.Their only weakness is their number.There's no intrigue.But this movie is not about how killed who or why is the why.It's about 300 man vs millions of man during 3 long day.You know they will die , they know they will die.They just fight hoping that their battle and why they fought would be remembered.THis is not a thriller nor a romance flick .But the vision of someone portraying the greatest soldier of that time.Born for battle.You simply love or hate.If you want a story and plot twist that not the movie you need.I have read several other review and most of the negative seem to come directly from ppl only seeking Titanic like movie.If only titanic like movie existed that would be hella boring .Sometime you need movie like 300 . You don't need to think or whine about why there's so much cliché.It's simply the vision of someone put on tape.Love or hate you choose.It's not a bad movie for people that just want to watch a show and not start writing the CHaos THeory",10,1,3,20 August 2007
