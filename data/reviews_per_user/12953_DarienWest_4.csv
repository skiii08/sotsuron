Ford v Ferrari," Mediocre and Oscar bait
","Ford v Ferrari is the most average and mediocre film to release at this point in the year. There is nothing great, good, bad, or terrible about this movie. It's just okay. But considering that great movies do exist, mediocre movies feel unsatisfying by comparison.The acting is by far the best part of the film. Matt Damon is amazing, Christian Bale is pretty great, and everyone else is just average, which is disappointing considering the notable cast. The child acting wasn't all that good.The writing is pretty unspecial and average. It takes the classic American underdog trope and does pretty much nothing original with it. There's almost nothing to say on this subject because of how little substance the writing has.The editing was alright but nothing special. The shot composition was alright but nothing special. The soundtrack... I've already forgotten everything about it, only a day after it came out. The adr was super noticeable and terribly implemented.Watch this if you are into racing or this story in particular, but for me it felt like a futile attempt at sweeping the Oscars.",6,5,19,18 November 2019
Captain Marvel," Feels like an unpolished script, not a film (spoilers in second half)
","The movie wasn't entirely bad. The CGI was overall very exceptional. The blasts, the ships, the age decreasing on Samuel L Jackson, was overall pretty good. However a few scenes did have noticeable green screens which you wouldn't expect from a movie of this budget. Some of the acting was also pretty good. Samuel J Jackson and Ben Mendelsohn did very well, and Brie Larson did alright for what she was given.Those are my only positives on the film. The rest of the acting is very lackluster, especially from Maria and her daughter. The fight scenes were boring and had absolutely no tension. In every scene people get shot out and die instantly or just get knocked around harmlessly. There really aren't any stakes for Captain Marvel and doesn't develop throughout the story. That's my main problem with the film, even though Thor 1 was a much worse film, at least Thor as a character is much more dynamic compared to Captain Marvel.Spoiler area: Maria is a terrible character. We keep getting told that Maria is Captain Marvel's best friend, but we are only 'shown' this in literally less than 10 seconds worth of flashbacks. The acting of her was also pretty terrible but I don't see how many actors could've pulled it off with this level of writing.The plot twist of the Skrulls actually being the good guys and the Kree being the bad guys is completely meaningless if you were invested in the first Guardians of the Galaxy. I've heard people defend this by saying 'it's just an origin film and of course we would know what happens, it's all about how it affects the main character.' But there's absolutely no reason to have sympathy on this since we already know what happens! It doesn't mean anything!The last thing I want to talk about is the ending fight scene, where Captain Marvel fights all the Kree at the end of the film. I want to compare this fight to the battle between Captain America and Iron Man at the end of Civil War. Aside from Iron Man cracking a few jokes to himself, the fight is very emotional, especially to Captain America, who is forced to fight his friend. In Captain Marvel, however, they turn this into a poor attempt at a James Gunn fight scene with pop culture music playing in the background, trying to give the scene a very light-hearted feel, even when Captain Marvel is literally fighting some of the only people she remembers. But I guess that doesn't matter, now does it, since we are only ever 'told' that they are friends.There's a lot more to say, but most other people have already said it. A dumb fun movie if you turn your brain off.",3,41,69,9 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The most mediocre, average, and unspecial movie of the entire year
","Star Wars, one of the most famous franchises to ever exist on our planet. And it ends with one of the most mediocre movies possibly ever made. There are some really good aspect, some aspects that could've worked if done differently, and there were some aspects that merely existed.The pacing is all over the place. They fit more rushed content into the first act than Episodes 7 and 8 combined, and the ending drags heavily. The 2 hour 20 minute runtime isn't even that long but it still doesn't feel justified.The plot is so predictable at times it gets painful. Whenever a new plot point is introduced, if you think you know how it's going to end, you definitely know how it's going to end.Some of the parts of the soundtrack were good, some were terrible, some were just remade versions from previous movies.Most of the computer generations looked amazing, but some of it looked atrocious. The main parts where it sucked were some of the funky looking aliens, and there's a scene at the end - you'll see what I mean when you see it.Most of the character arcs are way too rushed as well. Characters just change sides or have a change in heart with the flip of a switch.There were several attempts at comedy, but there was only one moment that was intentionally funny. The movie was overall very inconsistent in terms of tone, some parts are trying to be a sitcom but other parts are trying to be a dark thriller.Despite all these problems this movie does have redeeming qualities that balances it out. The acting across the board exceeds expectations. As mentioned earlier, most of the computer generations and soundtrack pieces were good as well. And the movie certainly wasn't boring. I've seen it once, and I won't see it again. Definitely the most mediocre and unspecial movie of the year, and possibly even the most mediocre movie I've ever seen.",5,1,1,21 December 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Best film to come out in 2019 as of now.
","The acting is completely perfect across the board. The characters are captivating. The dialogue is intriguing. The comedic scenes are hilarious. There is truly nothing bad to say about this film, and you can tell that Tarantino has set very high standards for himself with this one.",9,2,8,25 September 2019
