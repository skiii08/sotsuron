Despicable Me 2," What would Gru be without his Mignons...Mignons FTW!!
","They are back, even when I did not know how much I missed them. The sequel of 'Despicable Me' was none of my most anticipated movies of this year. Neither has the original movie been the big milestone of animated movies. Still the story around the super villain Gru, three little orphans and above all the little yellow helping fellers, his mignons, was entertaining and had some unforgettable scenes. I just say 'fluffy'. Now the creators had a hard job to do. Gru became a 'nice' father, ended his evil career and became business man. Ordinary problems like annoying neighbors and hyperactive kids can only be managed with his army of clumsy yellow guys. But his past reputation gets Gru a job at the AntiVillainLeague, where his know-how should be used to catch another bad guy. The story beginsWithout spoiling anything, because I guess everybody knows that Gru will succeed, this sequel shows how it is done! Creators really listened to the fans and did a remarkable job. They took everything what was great in the original movie, what had the highest potential and bundled it together to create a hilarious and enjoyable sequel, bigger and richer in variety, similar to the step 'Shrek'/'Shrek 2'. More of big eyed Agnes and much much more of mignons are the main pillars which prop the new adventure of Gru as Secret Agent. What is more, new characters like Mr. RamsBOTTOM and crazy Lucy, Grus big fan and more than just a helping hand, enrich this story tremendously.To sum up, 'Despicable Me 2' shows in special graphic style how movie ideas should be developed and how entertainment potential can be used effectively. With more screen time, the mignons may finally live up to the importance they deserve and I would not be shocked, if a mignon-spin off would follow. In short, great fun for every age!",7,1,4,14 July 2013
Ready Player One," Happy Easter...Egg
","Ready Player One may be criticized and reviewed out of many perspective. Let me summarize it like this. Alongside a quite weak and superficially installed story where virtual reality becomes standard daily life, a mediocre cast pulls through 140 minutes try hard writing including all the modern e-sport wordings they could collect. So most of the general viewers would rate it as an ordinary fantasy/action movie. Still, I have never experienced such pop culture celebrating festivity for the joy of 80is and 90is kids. If you have a little nerd in you, have been playing video games and watching movies during your life time and feel happy to see Ninja Turtles alongside with Halo fighters supporting Japanese anime characters and hints for our all-time favorite movies like 'Back to the Future', 'Jurassic Park', 'Breakfast Club', 'King Kong' or many more, well then enjoy smiling to the screen, looking out for more hints and goodies in the background and jump on the quest of Ready Player One to rescue the OASIS. Steven Spielberg used his pack of licenses, contacts and that he is the creator of so many pop cultural artefacts to present us a never ending avalanche of lovable things we players and movie enthusiasts can relate to. Not an 'outstanding' movie, but a great homage to our inner kid!",8,1,4,7 April 2018
Moana," A typical Disney princess story without the prince...
","Disney did it again, an amended princess story. Queuing into the load of critics, I may not add spectacular insights, but summarize my opinion for those who are undecided to see Moana in the cinema or not.Let's keep it short and simple. Moana (Vaiana in Austria and Germany) starts a world rescue mission within her mythical world of Maoris and Oceania in the best possible way. Disobeying her father the chief she starts a visually beautiful journey to help her people with the support of a likable demigod, sweet or funny sidekicks and not always comprehensible reasons within the story. As usual, the 'princess' of the island sings her way through mythical creatures and magic tricks. So far so good, but unfortunately nothing new.Let's take the ocean scenario away and agree on the key argument the creators spread in every interview, namely there is no romance as main motivation. OK, that's fine, but still I have seen this story a dozen times.What does it mean for you? Just that you see Merida, Arielle or what have you in a new disguise. New but similar songs, new but similar characters and new but similar characters. It's up to you to decide if you prefer sailing between the islands or riding a horse in the Scottish highlands. So Moana is a well-made, funny and nice feel good movie, but nothing you don't know yet.As a result, decide on the trailer. Do you like the scenario, then go for it but don't expect a big Disney surprise.",7,4,9,9 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Rise of the good Villains
","Let's face it, many critics have been published splitting the community of movie lovers and DC fans in many fractions. So I want to join those appreciated colleagues, who tried to give you an honest feedback of Suicide Squad and its story of really bad guys who can do something good.As neither a DC nor Marvel hardcore fan, nor more than a mainstream comic book reader, I was still as thrilled as many with the promising picture orchestration the various trailers showed us. A new set of remarkable characters in the dark universe of Man of Steel and Co should entertain the wannabe super villain in us, who wants to cheer for the bad but cool guys. The new interpretation of the Joker alone, kept us on the edge of the seat in awaiting the best movie experience ever. Well, here we have the problemthe hype.As always, expectations were tremendously high and people set unreachable hopes into the follow up after a disappointing Batman vs Superman. People expected the Joker to be a main character and a legendary movie to be created. I tell you the truth, if you leave that away, the movie is really good.In a short living action flick, with a really innovative compilation of pictures and soundtrack, the viewer experiences a straight origin story of a team of strange but somehow likable guys. From the famous crazy Joker sidekick Harley Quinn, over the human reptile Killer Croc, to Will Smith as Deadshot, we see a more or less loose newly created team growing together to kick some  well whatever the henchmen are. Additionally we see guest characters to make the DC universe more believable like the Joker, Batman or the Flash. To be honest, of course the story is fast pacing and not much individual origin story of the main characters is told. Yes the dialogues and story line has gaps, highs and lows and yes I understand that people wanted more of the Joker. BUT if you are open minded, the balance of all the issues with the focus on action, entertainment and fun will turn out as absolutely fine for the level a comic book movie may have. The Joker as side character has much more screen time than in most critics stated, as well as the story does not give so many mistake possibilities as reviewed mostly. For sure, the reason for that is the simplicity behind the movie, which could have a deeper story, as well as not all scene cuts were done very clever. Still the two hours will run by and keep you smiling. Please try to be forgiving for the fact, that maybe Harley Quinns relationship with the Joker is misplaced as too romantic, Deadshot is too focused on his daughter or how could this squad ever stop Superman if each of them can be hold back by five police men with a Taser Gun. As a result you see an awesome summer movie, which my twelve year old me can recommend with peace of conscience.In short, better than reviewed most of the time. Not the best movie or story, but a great spectacle and show!",7,0,1,19 August 2016
Beauty and the Beast," Disney, the professional
","Well, let's be honest. The beauty and the beast, a tale as old as time, even as most of us know it since 1991, is a story that maybe never needed a remake, never needed any improvement from the iconic original Disney movie and especially will split viewers in haters and lovers. Here is why.Emma Watson, a heroine for the whole Harry Potter generation with acting skills one could discuss but a charm and beauty you cannot ignore, embodies the new Belle in a way the story fits to our society. Luke Evans sticks out with perfect role fit, awesome skills and IS and will always be the real life Gaston. Dan Stevens as a CGI overloaded beast, Josh Gad as funny, gay and sympathetic companion on the bad side, and many stars more to fill the flick with life, music and fun. They all are a cast which let you agree, yes, if it was real, that's how the people were!But, and there is the split, what never is emphasized that much in a comic movie, is how fake and kitschy most of the backgrounds, costumes, dialogues and if you want the musical scenes are looking. Critiques are already summarizing missing singing skills of some cast members, the bad CGI and the fake atmosphere and I agree, still I absolutely loved this movie. You cannot expect a copy of the comic movie with talking closets, candlesticks or watches, a horse that finds the way and obviously stupid villagers doing illogical stuff all the day without looking fake. What was easier in Jungle Book, were the only week spot was the human, is not comparable with the more musical oriented script of Beauty and the Beast. Yes maybe the wolves and the beast could have been better, but if you are ready to jump into the musical entertainment show with all your kids heart from the 90ies, you are going to feel with all characters and situations the way Disney want you to and smile at the screen with every melody you could sing along immediately. If you were never one of these guys, then Disney could have done whatever you want and you would not have been satisfied. To summarize, chapeau for Luke Evans, thank you dear filmmakers for showing character and sticking to small gay gags and erasing a lot of illogical things out of the comic movie to make it 'more' realistic and consistent, congratulations for Emma Watson enchanting the next generation of kids with a beloved story and melodies and I pay all my respects to the so often criticized Disney company for just knowing what they do for fans. Besides company policy or whatever I am not the one to judge, in filmmaking they are professionals, period.",8,4,14,17 March 2017
