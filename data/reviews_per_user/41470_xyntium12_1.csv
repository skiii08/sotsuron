Skyfall," Skyfall: Different, Refreshing, and Surprising, Just a little lack
","This new James Bond Film in Daniel Craig tenure is somewhat different. The plot is the thing that can be said excellent, of course very much different. This movie has been matched with the current global issue dealing with more modern threat. The villain played by Javier Bardem can be said very good. He gives the villain character some differences from other villains That's for the plot. For the actors and the actress, the principal casts (James Bond, Eve, Q, Tanner, M, and Gareth Malory) have their parts almost equal. That's the first time ever in Bond Franchise that the Principal Cast do so. If you're a Bond Fans, you can refresh your mind about the previous Bond Film by watching Skyfall, since there are some direct references to the previous films, maybe for marking the 50th anniversary. This movie is also very surprising, that's why I urge you to watch if you haven't watched it yet.Somehow, this film is lack of what the series always have in the previous film. Among the principal casts, Berenice Marlohe as Severine is the weak part. She should have been given a more central role, even though she's in the opposite side of Bond. It's unorthodox, since any Bond Girls in the Franchise are given more central role, no matter of where they stand. The Bond Girls is the integrated part of the series, lacking their parts just seems like A tea without a sugar.For conclusion, this new film is a boost from the previous one, very different, Refreshing, and surprising, just lack what this film should have more.My Rating 8/10",8,2,9,13 November 2012
