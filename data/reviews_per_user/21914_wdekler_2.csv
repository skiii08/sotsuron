The Blair Witch Project," Avoid! Even police academy is better!
","I generally tend to like low budget movies, they have to rely more heavily on the script and acting than the big budget movies. So after hearing some good things about it I saw the movie on a friday evening.... and I have to say that the movie has one good feature: it's only 80 minutes you have to wait for it to end. All the people that I could overhear afterwards were telling each other how much they disliked this movie. You can compare this movie with the standard highschool horror movies, its only much worse and it adds nothing to the genre at all. Don't be misguided by people who say this all is ok because its art. It is not.The Blair Witch project has it all: bad script, bad acting, bad camera work.
Warning:  small spoiler aheadIf you're very scared of stones being deposited next to your tent at night, then you might actually like the Blair Witch project....",1,3,6,2 November 1999
Gone Baby Gone," Executing someone is a good thing... ?!?
","This was a reasonable enjoyable film for me, up until about 1 hour into the movie when I walked away after seeing the following things:*** spoiler *** The main character (an inexperienced detective) enters a room with the body of a dead child and a guy who claims responsibility. He says (crying) that something went very wrong.This makes him the suspect of a horrible crime... but no justice is served because the detective cowardly shoots him through the back of his head!! Excuse me?!? A few moments later he is comforted by his wife who tells him that the killer deserved to die anyway.And... the movie just seems to continue without the detective being arrested and sent to court for the murder he has just committed.Excuse me?!? I'm sure that there's a job opening for them in a Guantanamo Bay style prison to bring 'justice' to more people.",4,12,23,17 February 2008
