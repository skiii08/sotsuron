Deja Vu," This could have been a great Sci-Fi thriller
","Unfortunately could have been a great movie but this thriller wasted too much time on inconsequential facts, most of the movie focused on these little pieces of drivel which in the end did not even matter for example when Denzel Washington was shot in the shoulder and Paula Patton was cleaning his wounds she thru the gauze in the trash can. They focused on this twice once when Washington first went to her home and second when he wash shot and Patton cleaned his wounds. Script writers made sure to focus on such trivial things all through ought the movie. The ending did not seem to match since much of the movie tends to suggest that you can't change the past. If you did not see this film please don't waste your time! The ending would have been great if in the end nothing changed but that is just my opinion.Sorry to say this but true Si-Fi thriller fans should see this crap for what it is, the script is week like watered down coffee and goes from bad to worse. I noticed a lot of 'rave reviews' I feel sorry for the reviewers they don't know poor films when they view them their was just no; and I mean no continuity in the plot line, which was littered with to many Swiss cheese holes. I hate to be harsh but the film seemed to suggest on thing and deliver something totally different. The scenes where he was hit by a semi and survived was just bull and of course we have the total disregard for the safety of the drivers when Washington was playing chicken, following the terrorists; bull, just pure bull. What about all the loose ends which are never addressed such as the ambulance winding up on the barge, and the terrorists with his flack jacket and many guns. Well anyway I would not see if again if I could go back in time, there was no 'DeJavu' about this film.",1,7,14,10 June 2007
The Good Shepherd," Dreamy account on the creation of the FBI
","The Good Sheppard, seems to be a very surrealistic, dreamy account on the creation of the FBI, this film was kind of light on action. I would have to say that Robert DeNiro did a good job as director. I was not happy with the time jumps which seem to happen a lot in today's films (examples this film and All The Kings Men). This kind of film technique requires the viewer to seriously interject him/herself into the film, but this is not the kind of movie which lends itself to serious on the fly study, simply put it is long and drawn out. You can get up walk out and come back and feel like you haven't missed much. But I liked the wide screen version for the excellent scenes. I was just hoping for some more action. If you look on the back of the DVD case it states that this film is 'The Godfather' of CIA Movies' well in truth this film could in no way achieve that statement.",6,0,2,1 July 2007
