Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," What went wrong!? *sob*
","I can remember being a fairly big fan of Star Wars after my parents took me to the cinema to see 'Return Of The Jedi' when i was only seven. I was awe struck and instantly started to collect the weekly 'Return Of The Jedi' comic book. Round about 1984 in the comic it said that there were plans to make the 3 prequels but it was all hush hush. I remember thinking how awesome it would be. Well, as we all know the Star Wars prequels were along time away from being made in 1984 so when 13 years later i heard there were plans to actually make them with the latest effects i was over-joyed. Hmmm, i think you know where i'm going with this. I waited for two more years and when i finally got to see the first of the long awaited prequels. That's the day i lost my faith in George Lucas and CGI.I was extremely disappointed. I mean it is called 'Star Wars' and it has Jedi's and light sabre's in it. It also has the Emperor in it but it totally did not feel like a Star Wars movie. I really don't know where to begin.The Structure was poor for a start. The first couple of minutes at the beginning was fine then it just lost it. Talk about rushed scenes. One minute Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are sitting in a room on a Trade Federation starship and the next they're on Naboo with Jar Jar and then 30 seconds later they're in an underwater city. I was like 'what's just happened?!'. The plot is weak as heck too. Darth Maul was under-used and had very little depth to his character. There was far too much CGI used which made me feel like i was watching an animated movie. The film is just so very shallow. I didn't even care when Anakin blew up the Trade Federation ship at the end. Also, there is Jar Jar Binks who is by far the most annoying character ever! He is so much the definition of something that was supposed to be funny but ended up so not being. What was Lucas thinking!!!? About 95% of people who have watched 'The Phantom Menace' hated that floppy eared t**t! This is probably the reason why Jar Jar is hardly in 'Attack Of The Clones'.I basically think that the actors did a decent job, all the blame is Lucas's fault. I really was disheartened. I watched it again the other day just to see if i was really being too harsh on it and y'know, i disliked it even more. As a movie on its own it's average but because it was the first ever Star Wars episode and that i had waited about 15 years to watch it it was quite poor. The pod race was pretty cool though. 'Attack Of The Clones' is better but not by much. I just pray to god that 'Revenge Of The Sith' gets it right. 'The Phantom Menace' in many peoples opinion is a let down. 5/10",5,2,4,8 December 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Nothing can be as original as this.
","I've never been a huge fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus as most of it is far too over the top with blunt humour to boot. Wasn't too keen on The Meaning Of Life either and as for The Holy Grail, well that was pretty good but still was rubbish in places. Life of Brian on the other hand is extremely watchable and quite funny for the Monty Python crew where the humour still isn't the sharpest but it doesn't need to be. My favourite part has to be when Brian is being took away by the Roman soldiers and Judith starts to smack the back of John Cleese's Roman centurion character and her final smack knocks his helmet crooked and he turns round and says 'stop it' but it was the way he said it which had be laughing my head off! Just little things like that which makes this the best Python movie. Graham Chapman as Brian is great as he plays his charachter in a similar way as he did Arthur in Holy Grail (being funny by being serious), shame he died a while back as he is one of my favourite Pythons. Has to be admired for its originality and i think Life Of Brian is for anyone and yeah the song at the end 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' is a nice way from stopping the movie having a tragic end which would have been a terrible thing for a comedy spoof flick but the song is annoying so why they released it into the British pop charts in the early 90's is beyond me even though Eric Idle's performance on Top Of The Pops was funny. Funniest film ever? Nope. A very funny film? Yes indeedy. 8/10",8,2,6,7 April 2004
Final Destination 2," Very Inventive
","I take my hat off to this movie for having the most inventive killings ever in movie history. The guys behind them must have thought long and hard to be original and they succeeded! Almost every death shocked me and even though Final Destination 2 was a little scary, what made me the most scared (and paranoid) was the fact that any of these accidents could happen in real life! I still managed to leave my house this morning though hehe. What made this film fall short for me was the dodgy end. If you look at it with the information we are given throughout the movie that kid at the end shouldn't have died and the chick from the original died a cheap cheap death. Anyway, great movie, shame about the end. 8/10",8,1,2,10 February 2004
Predator," Everything a sci-fi/action fan could ever want.
","With the release of Alien Vs Predator i decided to watch the original Predator movie today. I've seen Predator many many times since i first watched it back in 1989 and i love it each and every time. I think Predator 2 has a slight edge over this but Predator has a slight edge over Aliens BUT i think they are all extremely excellent films.Just in case you don't know, it's about a big alien whose race lives to hunt worthy prey and Arnold Schwarzenegger's team of commandos are that such prey. The commandos are sent into a South American jungle to find some missing airmen who are being held by guerrilla's. They do what they got to do which attracts the attention of the predator who is hunting in the area. So the predator goes and hunts the commandos with the aid of his kick ass weapons and cloaking device. The commandos also have a female prisoner.I think the whole sub-plot about the so called missing airmen isn't too important to the viewer but makes it possible for the commandos to be there. The entire concept of Predator is really clever and it certainly made me sit on the edge of my seat while watching it the first time. It is kind of spooky in a terrifying way as we don't see the predator properly for ages but see through his eyes which adds to the tension.The effects are great, the acting is OK and the story is cool too. I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator. This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions. It really does have great atmosphere. Everyone who likes sci-fi and/or action movies should like this. If you don't then your taste in movies suck! This in my humble opinion is probably the second best sci-fi movie of all time.Alien Vs Predator has little of what made this so excellent so if you haven't seen Predator and thought AVP sucked don't think that this will. Predator is absolutely fantastic viewing. 10/10",10,246,320,23 August 2004
Dark City," A very good overlooked movie.
",I remember when Dark City was released. The trailers and advertising never made me interested so up until now i wasn't that bothered. I had the opportunity to view it yesterday so i thought 'why not'. I was expecting a stupid twisted movie that made no sense but i was wrong. I found it very enjoyable from start to finish and yeah it was kind of twisted but not too twisted for me to dislike. Just enough twistiness for my liking. It is very similar to The Matrix so that has to be a good sign of its calibre. I would say it's like The Matrix without the kung fu action scenes and instead of machines ruling a fake world we have aliens instead. Dark City came and went very quietly back in 1998 which is good because it's not a mainstream film and wasn't meant to be and to be honest non-mainstream movies are more respectable because they don't care about what the majority of the audience thinks. A 'Watch it and if you enjoy it then so be it' attitude. What i'm saying is that is was made for the pure film making experience aspect of it and not mainly for the almighty dollar so it wouldn't appeal to the mass market therefore it wasn't diluted.  Dark City could have had a little more detail about the aliens themselves and what makes them tick but this is a pretty good movie. 9/10,9,1,2,2 March 2004
Aliens," One of the best movies ever.
","This movie simply rocks. I think it was unfair of Cameron to make an Alien movie this great because it's a hard movie to follow up as the next two Alien movies prove. James Cameron knows what makes a great movie, it's like he's a movie fan more than a director because he knows what we want. Instead of having a few Aliens which would have been acceptable (because the first one had only one) we get treated to hundreds of aliens and marines with lots of guns! If i had it my way the guy would be writing and directing every sci-fi movie on the planet! Brilliant! 10/10",10,1,2,15 February 2004
Hellboy," A nice dose of fun.
","Ron Perlman of course makes this movie great and the special effects are excellent but the ending is quite muddled. Perlman has always been good in every movie he has been in so i knew if this sucked it wouldn't be his fault. I found the main monsters in this looking like something out of Men In Black so i wasn't too impressed by their design but how the government can possibly cover-up Hellboy after the fight in the subway is beyond me. An out of focus picture is one thing but sheesh! That Nazi guy with the blades was cool and i liked that helpful zombie near the end, very funny. I did find Hellboy slightly similar to Spawn but i won't split hairs here. A nice fun film which doesn't disappoint. 8/10",8,2,2,28 July 2004
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," not just for kids.
",I have always been very scepticle of Harry Potter and i have never read any of the books. I have ignored other people's (usually adults) recommendations of it and have no kids to use an excuse to see it and being a male adult in his late twenties i thought i would hate this movie! BUT i watched it and was quite bewildered at how much i enjoyed it. Richard Harris and Robbie Coltrane are of course the best actors in it and the children's acting is ok even though Daniel Radcliffe's acting is unconvincing at times with his words. But i did feel like a kid again while watching it and i can see how easy it could be to get immersed in such a world! Was a little disappointed that Alan Rickman didn't get more scene's as he's always awesome to watch no matter what film he's in. On the whole Harry Potter is for anyone who likes fantasy even though i have to admit it did seem a little too sickly sweet at times. I Like it but it doesn't make me want to read the books though :P 8/10 Oh yeah i watched the second film and Harry and the gang jump to the wrong conclusions about who the culprit is once again! You would have thought they would have learned from this one. DUH!,8,0,0,5 February 2004
Zombieland," Good film but where are the zombies?
","I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time and for the most part it is good. The comedy is quite clever, what little gore there is is good, the acting is OK (Woody Harrelson is excellent). The story could be better but i found the two girls tedious and annoying. You can always trust a chick to get in the way of a decent horror flick. But OK this is a zombie film so let's not look too deep into this. It is fun but my one big gripe is that with the exception of the first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes there are very few zombies at all. It's mostly them just driving along with no view of the living dead in sight and we get to Bill Murray's mansion with no view of the living dead in sight, OK the zombies are in it now again but the zombies might as well have been the cameo instead of Bill Murray. If i watch a movie called Zombieland i expect to see a load of zombies throughout.Otherwise this is a fun, cheesy and stupid horror flick that relies on pretty much Woody Harrelson to carry it which he does well. I give it an 8 because i'm a total zombie fan but if this was as good as the rating it has on IMDb i would have easily have given it a 10.",8,0,0,10 November 2009
Shark Tale," Just as good as Finding Nemo if not better.
","Yet another fun animated movie which unfortunately will live forever in the shadow of Finding Nemo. Shark Tale has got fishes and sharks in the ocean just like Finding Nemo but that is where the similarities end. Finding Nemo doesn't really have a true villain where as Shark Tale does. Finding Nemo is based more on reality where as Shark Tale isn't. The animation for Finding Nemo i would have to say is slightly better but i enjoyed Shark Tale slightly more.In Shark Tale the humour is quite good and a couple of subtle jokes for adults to laugh at. The characters are all pretty good especially the shrimp. Funny how that shrimp sounds a lot like Mr Hankey and Towelie from South Park! The Jelly fish also kick ass!My only little annoyance with Shark Tale is how Oscar looks too much like the guy providing his voice, Will Smith. Did they really need to do that? Don Lino looks a little like Robert De Niro but Will Smith's character is really taking the p*ss! Also the ending where Christina whats her face and Missy something or other (sorry, not big into pop music) come on as fishes and do a song. I thought that tarnished what is otherwise quite a great movie. Oh well, can't have everything. 9/10",9,2,4,19 October 2004
The Wizard of Oz," Ahead of its time.
",I haven't seen The Wizard Of Oz all the way through since i was a little kid and watching it again certainly made me feel like i was 7 again. Somethings about it were amazing for 1939 and i bet it cost a pretty penny when it was being made. It's nice and colourful but the thing that left me the most impressed was the tornado's in the first black & white segment. How did they put them in there back then? If it was now we would just think that they were CGI. I guess they just filmed a tornado and put it on a screen in the background and because it was B&W you couldn't tell but still very impressive. All in all it's a film that withstood the test of time (unlike Judy Garland R.I.P.) and will still be watched by all ages for centuries to come. Magic. 8/10,8,2,3,24 February 2004
Evil Dead II," The best Evil Dead.
","Evil Dead 2 is by far superior to the original Evil Dead which was pretty poor indeed. Despite what a few people say about this movie it IS a remake of the original but made so much better in every single way. Ash is cooler, there are some comedy elements but still has a twisted horror feel to it that no other horror movie has. Some of the effects are a little bit dodgy but this was made slightly before the days of CGI. Ash is darned cool as a normal guy coping with the pressures of demonic spirits and without this man the film would be mediocre at best. I love the way the demons (not zombies! morons!) walk, very twisted and scary. The follow up to this called Army Of Darkness pushes the comedy even further which in a way spoils it. Evil Dead 2 is a horror with comedy element but Army Of Darkness is a comedy with horror elements which is about as scary as an episode of Hercules or Xena. Watch this and then Army Of Darkness and forget about the first one. Evil Dead 2 is fantastic in nearly every way and should be watched by anyone who remotely likes a bit of horror with a side dish of comedy. 9/10.",9,2,3,13 May 2004
