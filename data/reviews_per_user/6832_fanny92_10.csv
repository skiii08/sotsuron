Walk the Line," Not A Personal Favorite, But Definitely Iconic
","I always heard of Johnny Cash growing up and I've listened to a couple of his songs before, but I have never really known much about him. Watching this movie, I was able to learn more about him and who he was. I'm not sure why, but this movie is not really my favorite. It was definitely interesting, but it's just not my type of movie. Aside from that, the movie was very well made and had great acting. A great scene from this movie was when June Carter and her family are staying at John's house trying to help him recover from his addiction to drugs and they chase his drug dealer off his property with their rifles.
The plot of this movie is just the timeline of Johnny Cash's life and all that he went through. It starts out when he was a little boy and continues on to when he becomes really famous.
Before I watched this movie, I didn't really know a lot about this time period, or about Johnny Cash and his life. The history part of the movie was interesting to me, because I was able to learn a little more about the time period, but also learn the history of Cash. I have seen a few civil rights movies that were also set around this time period (50's to 60's). There wasn't really anything in this movie that made me question its accuracy, but I didn't know a lot about Johnny Cash before. This movie, even though it was set in the 50's and 60's reminds me of some famous people now who do drugs like Cash did. I hear a lot about certain movie stars who overdose.
The director of this movie is James Mangold. I've only seen one other movie by him, Kate and Leopold. The two main actors in this movie are Joaquin Phoenix, who plays Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon, who plays June Carter. I have seen Reese Witherspoon in another movie, but I have never seen Joaquin Phoenix in any movies besides this one. They are both great actors. My favorite scene in this movie is the first scene where Johnny Cash performs after he makes his first record. The atmosphere of the scene was really cool and really set the mood for a concert.
This movie was very well made and had great acting. I liked that it had the nitty gritty of Cash's life as well as the good things; that made it more realistic. It's not a movie that I would watch on my free time because it is not a personal favorite. I would recommend it to others who like Johnny Cash or that type of music, though.",7,3,4,6 February 2019
Miracle," Go Team U.S.A.!!
","The first time I heard about this movie, I had no idea what it was or what it was about, but when I watched it, I loved it. I had never watched hockey before and this was the first time. I was actually really interested in it and it was fun to watch. It was also interesting to learn about the story, too, which I had never heard of.
This movie is about the American olympic hockey team in 1980 coached by Herb Brooks. The team was made up of college hockey players, who ended up beating the Russian hockey team, the greatest hockey team in the world. They ended up winning the gold medal in hockey.
I honestly do not know how accurate this movie is, but it seemed pretty believable to me. I thought it was very interesting, because it did not just have to do with them winning the best hockey team in the world, but also having a victory over the Soviet Union. This movie was set during the Cold War, so to win the Russian hockey team was kind of like a little victory. Another thing I found interesting was how Herb Brooks picked and coached his team. It does not have to do with world history, but the history of the hockey team. Brooks did things very differently, but in doing so, created a strong team. He not only wanted them to have great endurance and stamina, but to bond as a team and work together.
The director of this movie is Gavin O'Connor. He did a great job with this movie. It is a good mix of serious and fun, with a little bit of suspense, which I like. Some of the main actors are Michael Mantenuto, Kurt Russell, Eddie Cahill, Noah Emmerich, Patricia Clarkson, and Nathan West. I really loved all of the characters and thought the actors did a great job. I loved the chemistry between the team and the coaches; it made for a great movie. My favorite scene in the movie was when team U.S.A. played Russia in the olympics and beat them, especially after they had lost to them at Madison Square Garden previous to that. It was very suspenseful at first, but victorious at the end.
Overall, I just thought it was a great movie. The first time I started to watch it, I wasn't sure if I would be interested in it or not, because it was a movie about hockey and I had never watched hockey before, but I loved it. It gave me more of an interest in hockey. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.",9,2,2,9 May 2019
Captain Phillips," On the edge of my seat
","Before I watched this for the first time, I had only heard the name of it, but I did not know what it was about. When I first learned about what it was about, I had never heard of Somali pirates and I had no idea that they would ransom boats to make money. It was very interesting to learn about that.
This movie is about a ship captain, Captain Phillips, whose ship is taken over by Somali pirates. His crew ends up being fine, but he gets taken hostage by the pirates as ransom.
I did not know anything about this story before I watched the movie. I am not sure how accurate it is either. I would have to do more research on it. It was so crazy though! I know there are a million crazy things that have happened throughout history, but for some reason I just found this one really crazy. It blew my mind that just four men with machine guns could be a threat against a whole crew of men. I had my mouth open the whole time I was watching this movie.
The director of this movie is Paul Greengrass. He did a really good job of creating suspense and tension in this movie. I was literally at the edge of my seat the whole time, and my muscles were super tense. The main actors in this movie are Barkhad Abdi, Tom Hanks, Faysal Ahmed, Mahat M. Ali, Michael Chernus, and Barkhad Abdirahman. I have not seen any of these actors in any other movies except for Tom Hanks. They did an amazing job. It was kind of scary. I love Tom Hanks; he has always been a great actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Captain Phillips was trying to get off the boat he had been captured in by telling the pirates that he had to go to the bathroom. Instead of going to the bathroom, he pushed one of the men off the boat and jumped off, trying to swim away. It was so intense.
This was a crazy and intense, but really good movie. Every scene left me wondering what would happen next. It was kind of nice that I did not know the story, because the suspense was even better. I would recommend this movie to anyone who also likes suspense and is looking for a good realistic action movie.",8,0,0,13 May 2019
42," 100% On My Movie Meter
","I always remember learning about Jackie Robinson in elementary and how he was the first African American man to play in major league baseball, but that is about it. We never learned about what he really went through. My first experience watching 42 was at school. I loved it and it became one of my favorite movies. I immediately had my family watch it and it became a favorite for all of us. I have watched it several more times and love it every time. One of the greatest scenes in this movie reminds me of when I was in elementary school learning about Pee Wee Reese putting his arm around Jackie Robinson. Learning about that as a young kid, I never really understood why he did that, and I never really understood racism, but watching that scene when I was older, I understood.
The movie follows Jackie Robinson as he makes it onto the Montreal Royals baseball team and then goes on to be the first African American in major league baseball as a Brooklyn Dodger. It also follows Branch Rickey as he breaks the color barrier in baseball.
Like I said before, I already knew that Jackie Robinson was the first African American to play in major league baseball before watching this movie, but that's all I really knew about him. After I watched this movie I was able to see what he really had to go through and the courage that he had to have to not fight back. I love the history in this movie and always find it amazing to learn about very courageous people. With every historical movie, I always question the accuracy because you never know if everything portrayed in the movie will be right or not. With this movie, I didn't ever really question the accuracy. I would still need to read up on Jackie Robinson's story more to see if this movie is really accurate, but what I have read of his story, the movie follows. I really love that this movie can be applied today. Racism is still going on around us and this movie helps to fight against that. There are also many people in today's world that have to be courageous like Jackie Robinson because of discrimination whether they are in a group being discriminated or whether they are being discriminated against personally.
The director of this movie is Brian Helgeland. I have never heard of him before, and haven't seen any of the movies he's directed besides this one, but I am familiar with some of them. He did an amazing job directing this movie. The main actors in this movie are Chadwick Boseman, Harrison Ford, Nicole Beharie. I love Harrison Ford and Chadwick Boseman as actors. I have never seen Nicole Beharie in another movie, but she was a great actress in this movie. My favorite scene in this movie was after Ben Chapman had been bad mouthing Jackie on the field. Jackie almost couldn't take it, but he kept on going and fighting for what was right.
I really loved the acting in this movie and I loved the message that was given to keep fighting for the right thing. I could watch this movie a million more times and not get sick of it. I love learning about the history of civil rights and the civil rights issues and I love this movie because it shows how those issues were fought against, but in a different setting than a lot of other civil rights movies I have seen. I recommend this movie for those who love history, specifically the history of the civil rights era, and for those who just love baseball.",10,1,2,6 February 2019
Remember the Titans," I have loved this movie since childhood
","I grew up watching this movie and it has been one of my favorites for a long time. When I was really young, I used to say that I liked it just to impress my dad by liking a football movie (he loves football), but once I got older, I actually did love it. I just love the feel of it, the characters, and the growth that the team goes through.
The movie is about a high school football team that is put together right after the desegregation of black and white students in schools. Throughout the movie, the team grows closer and become a really good football team.
This movie is based on a true story, but it is not very accurate. I think it may be accurate in portraying what it was like after schools were desegregated, but not totally accurate in portraying the specific story of this high school football team. I think a lot of what it shows still applies today even though that event occurred in the 70's. Today, there are still people fighting against change and against people who are different than them. There is still discrimination among many groups all over the world.
The director of this movie is Boaz Yakin. He did an amazing job directing this movie. This is the only movie I have seen that he has directed. Some of the main actors in this movie are Denzel Washington, Ryan Hurst, Wood Harris, and Will Patton. They are all great actors and played their roles well. I have seen Denzel Washington in other movies and I love him as an actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when Gerry and Julius become really good friends after hating each other. I just loved the connection that they had.
Even though this movie is not very accurate to the story it is based on, I still love it. I thought it was really well acted, and the characters worked well together. I liked that it brought out serious themes like hard work, equality, and treating others with kindness, but was also fun and entertaining. This is a movie that I definitely recommend.",9,1,2,8 May 2019
Hidden Figures," Always A Favorite
","I love this movie so much! I only saw it a little while ago, but I fell in love with it the moment I saw it. I knew before I watched it that there were women at NASA that did a lot of the hard work and never got the credit for it, but I had never heard any individual stories of these women. Watching this movie, I was able to get a taste of what it was like for them and what things they did at NASA.
This story is about three African American women: Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan. They all worked at NASA in the 1960's. This movie is featured around the launch and orbit of John Glenn and shows the amazing work that these three women did to help with his launch.
I never really knew much about this part of history. I didn't know much about the space race, the Cold War, and I didn't know about the hidden figures helping out in the space race. It was amazing to see how smart these women were and how brave they were to fight against unequal treatment of women and African Americans. I don't know if this movie was completely accurate or not, but it did give a shout out to these women and really helped to reveal what they did for NASA.
The director of this movie is Theodore Melfi. I have never seen any of his other movies, but he did an amazing job with this movie. The set, the music, the atmosphere of the movie, the character development, helping us to get to know the characters and see their bravery. It was a very well put together movie. The three main actors in this movie are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae. They are amazing actresses! They did a great job acting in that time period and they really brought out the good qualities of the women they portrayed. One of my favorite scenes in this movie is when Mary Jackson goes to court to get permission to go to classes at an all white school to become an engineer. She is just amazing.
This movie, again, is one of my favorite of all time. It really makes me proud to be a woman when I watch it and it just amazes me what these women went through. It also amazes me how smart they were. This movie is a great history movie, but it is also a very entertaining movie. I definitely recommend it.",10,0,5,20 March 2019
Selma," Beautifully Made
","I love this movie and have seen it many times. It is beautifully acted and the picture is beautiful as well. I love this movie because I have always been interested in learning about the civil rights movement. During my elementary years, we vaguely talked about civil rights, and so it wasn't until high school that I started learning more about the movement. It really interested me and this movie has helped me to learn even more and understand what went on and what is going on. It helped me to visualize it better.
This movie is about Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement that he led: a peaceful, non-violent one. It follows him as he and the others helping in this movement marched and petitioned for their rights, specifically in a city called Selma, in Alabama.
Like I said before, I've always been interested in the civil rights movement, but I haven't always been very educated about it. This movie helped to educate me on a few of the many events that happened during that time period. Nothing in this movie made me question its historical accuracy. It was interesting for me to see the different civil rights groups and how they interacted and did things differently.
This movie was directed by Ava DuVernay. I have not seen any of her other films, but she did an amazing job directing this one. Some of the main actors in this movie are David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey, Carmen Ejogo, Tom Wilkinson, and Stephan James among others. I have seen quite a few of these actors in other movies and think they are all great actors. They all did a phenomenal job in this film. My favorite part of this movie is when they are going on their second (I think it's their second?) march to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They end up turning back and not finishing the march, but it's just really cool to see how united everyone is in a great cause.
I really love this movie. It is well filmed and well acted. I love the history it shares and uses to educate. I love the historical characters it portrays and I love the courage and conviction it shows in the film of everyone in that movement. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves history, especially civil rights history.",10,0,3,14 March 2019
Thirteen Days," Lots of Talk, But Intense
","I've never really known a lot about the Cold War, besides it being mentioned, and when I did learn about it in my history class, it wasn't taught in very much detail. Watching this movie helped me to understand what was happening during it a little bit more. This movie is mainly focused on the Cuban Missile Crisis, so just a part of the Cold War, but it still helped me understand it better and be able to visualize what was going on. This was a great movie. It was well acted, and I liked the scenes with President Kennedy and Kenny O'Donnell. It was interesting to see how they interacted and to see what they were like under such great pressure.
Again, the movie is about the Cuban Missile Crisis. It follows the president of the United States and members of Congress and shows what they went through to solve the missile crisis.
Like I said, I did not know much about the Cold War and I did not know anything about the Cuban Missile Crisis before I watched this movie. Even while I was watching the movie, I didn't quite understand everything that was going on, but I still really enjoyed it. I just really like history even when it's confusing. This movie was a lot of talk and not a lot of action, but it had the action feel to it because of the intense situation that everyone in the movie was working to try and resolve.
This movie was directed by Roger Donaldson. I haven't seen any of his other movies. The main actors in this movie are Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, and Steven Culp. I'm not familiar with Greenwood and Culp, but I have seen other movies with Kevin Costner in them. I think he is fun to watch in movies and is a good actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when the airplanes were flown over Cuba and they took pictures of the missiles. It was a really quick scene, but it was intense and interesting to watch.
I feel like a lot of people don't like movies that are mostly talk and they probably find them boring, but I like movies like that that are history related. They really interest me, even when I don't understand them, which is probably weird, but I do. I really liked this movie. It was interesting to me to see how everyone in congress working on the Cuban Missile Crisis interacted and the different opinions on how things should be done. I would watch this movie outside of school and I would recommend it to people who are interested in that kind of history and like boring movies like me.",8,1,2,13 March 2019
Apollo 13," Good to Know the Story
","I've always heard the name Apollo 13 and have always known that it was a space mission, but I have never actually heard the story. Until I watched this movie, I had no idea what had happened or what their mission was for. I never knew that they were trying to get to the moon again on that mission. Because I never knew the story, I was in suspense the whole movie, which I like while watching movies. Unlike in other history movies where I know what is going on, this one was interesting to watch because it was almost like history unfolding right in front of me which was cool.
This movie is about NASA's Apollo 13 mission to try to get to the moon after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had gotten there the first time. Three astronauts are sent on this mission: Jim Lovell, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert. Some things on their mission go wrong and they and their team back on earth do all they can to get the three astronauts safely home.
Before I watched this movie, I did not know this part of history. I had no idea that there had been another mission to try and get to the moon after the Apollo 11 mission. This part of history is really interesting to me because we put men into space which is really awesome. Even though the technology back then is not near to what it is now, it still amazes me that they were able to put people and even just things into space. It blows my mind.
The director of this movie is Ron Howard. I have seen a couple of the movies that he has directed. I really liked them. There was only one I watched that he directed that I didn't like. The main actors in this movie are Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, and Bill Paxton who play the three astronauts. I have seen Tom Hanks and Kevin Bacon in a few movies, and I think they are great actors. They are always entertaining to watch and I like the type of movies they have been in (at least the ones I have seen). My favorite scene in this movie was when the astronauts were trying to stay on target with the earth, but had to keep the earth in view from their window, instead of using technology because most of the technology in their shuttle was down.
I really liked all the scenes with the astronauts in space, especially after everything went wrong. It was interesting to see how they acted and reacted in their desperate situation. It was also interesting to see how their team on earth worked together to get the astronauts safely home. This was a great movie and the space scenes were really realistic. The acting was really good too. I would watch this movie outside of school.",8,0,1,20 March 2019
Back to the Future," Childhood Movie
","This movie is a classic and one of my favorites. I used to watch it when I was little and it has always been a family favorite. It has a fun story line and a very interesting concept. It has many great scenes. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Marty, the main character, realizes that he is in 1955 instead of 1985 and he meets his dad and Biff.
This movie is about Marty, a high school student, and his friend, Dr. Brown, a scientist, who creates a time machine in the form of a car. Marty gets transported from 1985 to the past in 1955. He meets his parents who are then in high school and he has to get his mom to fall in love with his dad so that he will still exist in the future.
The history in this movie is interesting because it kind of compares the 50's era with the 80's era. I knew about both eras before; mostly what the styles in clothing were. I really like the way they compared the two eras using the contrast between Marty who was from the 80's and his parents who were from the 50's and how they interacted with each other. It made me wonder what it would be like if I went to the past and met my parents.
The director of this movie is Robert Zemeckis. I have seen a couple of the movies he has made and thought that they were well made. The main actors are Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, and Crispin Glover. I haven't seen any other movies that I know of with these actors in it, but I am familiar with the actors Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. I enjoyed all of these actors in this show and thought they did a great acting job. My favorite scene from this movie was when Marty gets hit by his grandpa's car and meets his mom for the first time as a teenager. It was a well done scene because it set up the problem that Marty had to fix.
I just overall love this movie. It brings back great memories from when I was young. It is fun to follow and it has a different plot that really makes you think about what it would be like if something similar happened to you. I would recommend this to people who like science fiction and who just want a good laugh and fun movie to watch.",10,0,0,6 February 2019
