50 First Dates," A Truly Great Movie
","It's rare for me to enjoy a movie more than once, so I rarely buy movies. But I've watched this movie probably every time I see it on the TV, and I'm pretty sure I also saw it at the movies when it was out. I saw it yet again over Thanksgiving, and that's it, I'm going to buy it, and I should have bought it a long time ago. Yeah it's a romantic comedy, but hey, it's funny with a good and interesting story. I'm not really sure why I'm not giving it 10 stars, because for what it is, it just might be perfect.I really like Drew Barrymore, she's hot and is my favorite actress, and Adam Sandler is, strangely enough, probably my favorite actor... seems weird calling him an actor, but he is. Anyway, if you like one or both, you're bound to like this movie a lot. Enjoy!",9,0,1,2 December 2008
Click," Excellent Indeed
","OK. I knew I liked Adam Sandler movies, even Spanglish, and yet I never saw Click at the movies. The preview made it seem kinda stupid. Yes, I know it's an Adam Sandler film. Anyway, about 2 years after they make it, I get it from Netflix... and was blown away.I was truly shocked. This isn't just another funny Adam Sandler film, it's freekin awesome. I'm thinking awesome as in Star Wars, Shawshank Redemption, Pulp Fiction awesome. A serious film whose TV ads/previews didn't do it justice. I saw the movie thinking I was going to see something like Happy Gilmore or Waterboy or maybe even 50 First Dates, but no, it's a movie definitely worthy of 10 stars and better than 99% of the crap that's put out these days. As Siskell and Ebert used to say, 'Thumbs up, way up.'",10,0,1,2 December 2008
