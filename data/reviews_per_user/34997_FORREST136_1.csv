The Sound of Music," Sing-A-Long with Julie and the Gang!
","Recently had the pleasure of seeing the reissue of this timelessclassic at the Zigfeld Theatre in NYC! Except this time the words to the wonderful songs were written at the bottom of the screen!  What a great idea!  People camedressed as characters from the film,and even Charmian Carr was in the audience ALL GROWN UP!  A bautifully restored print and wonderful msic made thisa most enjoyable evening!  Even in 2000! Thirty Five years after it was released! TIMELESS!!",Null,0,5,21 July 2001
