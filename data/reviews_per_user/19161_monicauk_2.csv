Blade Runner 2049," I just love this movie
","I saw this originally at the cinema and felt the need to write this review after 2nd viewing on Netflix. I just love it. It evokes such a variety of emotions. Melancholy, fear, excitement, tenderness, love, sacrifice. The score is amazing and renders you immersed and absorbed in the Bladerunner world. Ryan Gosling and Sylvia Hoeks, perfectly cast. Congratulations to everyone involved in this masterpiece.",10,1,9,22 September 2019
Passengers," Loved this. Made me cry.
","I love sci fi and I love a good love story so as this combined the two so I couldn't go wrong. Wanted to watch it with my wife but she is so anti sci fi, she passed up the opportunity. The cast is tiny, but what a cast. Really enjoyed it. Nough said.",9,2,3,7 January 2019
