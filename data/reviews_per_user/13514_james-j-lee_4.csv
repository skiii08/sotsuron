Changeling," A Missed Opportunity to Make a Classic
","How I wish I was Clint Eastwood's Editor! Changeling had all the makings of real classic - great story, excellent period location, solid actors, good score...etc, etc, but as usual with Clint, he's overcooked it, takes it one more step and the work skirts with the pornographic.He should take a leaf out of Hitchcock's book and realise that less is often more in movies. Scorcese also talks about the missing frame on celluloid being planted into the viewers mind (for examples see Tarantino's ear cutting scene in Reservoir Dogs or Danny Boyle's Shallow Grave burial scene.)What we have with the Changeling is a well produced, well detailed, well acted drama, but it goes to far.The drawn out execution scene was completely unnecessary, as was the over blown asylum scenes.Angelina Joli does well in a meaty role, but you can't help feeling she is going through the motions at times and not varying the emotions enough to make it interesting. At almost every dramatic turn we see her face crumple, a few tears fall, then the hands shake, the trembly bony fingers and soon it's the head in the hands and cut to next scene. It all looks a bit formulaic - the method gone sad if you like.Malkovic puts in a decent shift as the militant preacher fighting police corruption and bad cop Jeffrey Donovan is also pretty good if at times a bit too stupid to be a top cop with his completely narrow view of events.It's worth watching this movie for the sets and the good storyline, Eastwood delivers fine production values but he needs to get a grip of a decent editor to avoid these dark indulgences that we witness far too often in his movies - Mystic River (a terrible final scene), Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby to name but a few.Changeling? Watch on TV or rent don't buy the DVD as it's unlikely to invite a second viewing for most.One final side note - Eastwood might have introduced some typical 1920s entertainment in the back drop - i.e. there was no radio, no source music and the town and townsfolk seemed to be completely lacking in any form of entertainment - bear in mind the film is set in LA during the boom of cinema, live theatre, live music and speakeasies full of flappers - but there is not a sight of any of that. Eastwood's 1920s LA is like Moscow 1950. Disappointing because he had a big opportunity to capture the mood of the 1920s v the contrast of this dark story. All in all worth watching, but once will probably be enough!",8,1,3,22 January 2012
No Country for Old Men," Very watchable but lacking originality.
","A good film, well produced and some decent performances but hardly original. Here we have an everyday man stumbling upon stolen loot and a massacre scene in the desert. Sound familiar? Yep it was an identical premise (and scene) to the plot for The Good The Bad and The Ugly. Only in the GB&U it was the 'tip off' of where loot was hidden. Similar theme in It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and Shallow Grave and many others.Back to NCFOM and the main protagonist who takes the law into his own hands also has many parallels with too many other film characters to mention - but you could toss in the likes of D-Fens in Falling Down, Butch and Sundance, etc etc.Enter the psycho who just kills everyone for the hell of it. Or as the bounty hunter Woody Harrelson says 'he'll kill you for the inconvenience' Yep we've seen all these types before also - Arnie, Rambo, Mr Blonde from Reservoir Dogs, etc etc...Then comes the straight Sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who doesn't use a gun if he can help it - yep we've seen this type before too - see High Noon, Shane, etc etc.So the characters are fairly stereotypical and the plot not the freshest to ever grace the screens. But there is an added dimension, the psycho is in fact haunting the Sheriff and in fact will haunt him forever - this is fairly well done but it is pretty odd. Why? Well the sheriff isn't the main protagonist in this film, he only really becomes 'part' of it in the last third, by that time most will not really care about him. It would have been better and made more sense had the Psycho haunted the couple forever.Cinematography is excellent, the direction pretty good but on the whole this is just a re-hash of several films with the Coen stamp over it.There are a few very stupid moments. Like Josh Brolin waiting for the psycho to come into his hotel room. Josh sits on the bed right in front of the door. Surely the sensible thing would have been to lie down behind the bed or move over to the side of the room to reduce the risk of being caught by the bulletfire. Also in another later scene, the way Josh Brolin enters Mexico pretending to Border Patrol he is a drunk was silly. Only outdone on the silliness scale by him re-entering America with few clothes on having escaped from hospital. He tells the Border Patrol guard he's a Vietnam vet but shows no ID yet he's gets the all clear to enter. Very silly indeed but I am willing to retract these remarks and apologise to the Coens if in fact such occurrences do happen on the USA/Mexican Border.Yet despite all the flaws this movie does work. It does create tensions and most viewers will get caught up in the cat and mouse games.There are times when the dialogue is a bit slow and with no soundtrack sometimes it seems an age to get through a sequence especially when it is sometimes difficult to follow because the accents are so thick.In summary,NCFOM is a bit overrated but is certainly good, watchable cinema and though the ending may leave some feeling cheated it is at least a bit different unlike the rest of the film which seems very similar to a lot of action films based on greed and lawlessness.",8,1,5,22 January 2012
The Artist," Like Someone Has Just Uncovered A Lost Masterpiece
","It may have been a cold January night in Leicester Square when I left the cinema but inside I was glowing, my faith somewhat restored in film having just seen this heartwarming classic.There's little point going through the deeply romantic/dramatic plot set in stark contrast against the shallow world of 1920's Hollywood as it may only spoil it for those yet to see, but in summary this film is a real gem, a true joy to behold with a clever little unpredictable twist at the end. Fabulous acting, superb score, great cinematography and look out for a star turn from a little performing dog which is quite amazing at times.With lots of classic touches woven throughout this movie, expect to laugh out loud, cry real tears and go through a roller-coaster of emotions as you will no doubt watch in fascination, the vivid recreation of an exceptional time in the history of cinema (the advent of talkies)and the history of the America (Wall St Crash/Great Depression).Though it is a silent film, sound is used in a very clever way. Similarly the director meshes subtle modern cinema techniques with some classic framing and detail. This is a glorious mixture of the old and the new and has great balance between light comedy/entertainment, intense romance and at times dark drama. The result being interesting characters that engage on many levels.It's worth mentioning the nods to some of cinema's all time classic films like Singing in the Rain, Sunset Boulevard and Citizen Kane(and several Chaplin classics) but it's not plagiarism, parody or irreverence - it's a beautiful pastiche of the cinema's finest. Watching The Artist, feels like someone was clearing out an old Hollywood Studio and stumbled upon one of the greatest silents (if not films) of them all and suddenly the lost masterpiece is revealed to the world.Emerging from the Cinema and into the crisp night air of Leicester Square, my thoughts were on one thing...how many Oscars will this instant classic win come February? The Academy certainly didn't disappoint as it picked up 5 Oscars including Best Actor, Best Picture and Best Director. A big thank you to all who were involved in this magnificent production, a truly wonderful film, delivering a great cinematic experience.",10,18,26,13 January 2012
The Wrestler," A moving and insightful drama
","An excellent film with outstanding performances from Mickey Rourke and Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood.In essence, this film is a reflection of working life as it really is for the masses - i.e. work for low pay until you die and/or until you are too old to enjoy life, and while doing so neglect the important things in life like developing and maintaining relationships with family and friends.It all sounds a bit corny but the story of Randy 'the Ram' Robinson is not that different from many people in jobs they hate but have to do either for money or because they can't let go of the only thing they really know and feel part of. It sounds quite sad and The Wrestler is indeed a fairly sad film.Though sadness for Rourke's Randy might be forthcoming, the real sadness is for the two women in his life - Marisa Tomei - the would be girlfriend who works as a stripper/dancer but is a single mother trying to balance her double life - professionally a sexy dancer and privately a mother just trying to escape the sleaze of her profession. She sees Randy as a man she could maybe feel for and in the end she does care for him unlike his daughter Evan Rachel Wood who has been let down once too many times to care any more for her father.Where The Wrestler really works is in the intimate direction and pacey storyline. There is no flab in this movie except around the waistlines of some of the musclebound mountain men wrestlers. It's very well done with steady cam shots and sure editing. The story and characters quickly hook us and though the wrestling scenes are a bit too graphically gory, it's a journey we have to go through to fully understand the man and his motives.Though the film plays on pathos and is quite brutal (and not just the wrestling scenes)The Wrestler does have some very funny moments and a good tight script. It's a very watchable movie and in some ways enjoyable. The underpinning theme of loneliness is woven around each of the three key characters and in the end you'll probably want to be better to those around you and maybe contact those you've neglected for a while.I don't often like sporting movies but The Wrestler is one that has to be one of the best sporting movies ever made as it gives a real insight into the sport/entertainment industry. It's certainly worth watching for Rourke's outstanding performance.",8,0,0,19 January 2011
