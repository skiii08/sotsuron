Marie Antoinette," Overlong, boring and inaccurate
","Watching this movie, I was repeatedly reminded of the fifties 'Sisi' trilogy starring Romy Schneider. Only, that had a plot. Here, all you get are the endless sweet-colored pictures, the occasional pomp&circumstance scenes, and the idealized, soft-focus versions of the real characters. And then all of a sudden (yet, still at least half an hour too late) it's all over, exactly at the point where the action, i.e., the Revolution starts. Okay, so Sofia Coppola was not aiming for a historically correct depiction of Marie-Antoinettes life. She must have realized that historical accuracy was not an option in a film that has Louis XVI's Parisians dancing in the foyer of an opera house that wasn't built for another 100 years. The question is, what WAS she aiming for? I must confess that I have no idea. Unless she was trying to convey to the viewer the boredom of the Queen's life. That worked - I was magnificently bored. The repetitive scenes of M-A's gambling, drinking and dressing are very colorful, but you fill up on them pretty quickly. The attempts at sketching a historical context are so perfunctory that I can't think why they bothered at all. And the much discussed use of pop music in the score is utterly random, a mere gimmick without any deeper meaning. There are no characters to identify with. Most of the cast never rises above caricature, with the gay hairdresser as the absolute nadir. Unbelievable that somebody still has the guts... Louis XV is not far behind, the acting verging on the amateurish. Dunst, too, has hardly more to offer than vague smiles, dimpled cheeks and perambulations in dazzling rooms; it is not like there is a script full of brilliant dialog that offers major acting opportunities. Instead, there's another box of shoes, another glass of champagne, another party. It's the cinematic variant of muzak. Anything positive? Well, one thing that is spot-on is the way the film shows how the lives of M-A and Louis were lived in public, and the often ridiculous and/or embarrassing consequences of this. Also, Coppola at least had the decency to grant M-A that she never actually said 'let them eat cake'. But it would have been so much nicer to see such accuracy embedded in a film that takes its subject seriously overall, and not merely uses it as an excuse to indulge visual sweet-tooths.",3,45,91,4 June 2006
The Day After Tomorrow," Very silly
","I'm not averse to sensationalist disaster movies that have special effects as their main plot-motivation. I actually liked Independence Day. But at least that contained some humour. This movie takes itself so seriously that you're constantly aware exactly how silly it all is. Or have you ever seen a TV-anchor reporting live while standing a few hundred metres from not one, but TWO tornado's. I say, he deserved to get hit by that piece of debris!The characters are all utterly uninvolving, so that you really don't care a hoot what happens to them. Random subplots are inserted to add interest, but fall completely flat. What's it with that sick boy the scientists wife is looking after? And oh yes, while the whole nation is crumbling under an unprecedented natural disaster, they're sending an ambulance through the blizzards especially to pick these two up...!? (Not to mention the army of helicopters flying into NYC to save daddy and son - as if that is all they have to do). The ship drifting into the NY streets is ludicrous, of course, but worked in a surrealistic way. The wolves however are the movie's worst idea, and badly done at that. I must say that in general I did not find the special effects particularly impressive, with the exception of the tidal wave flooding New York. All in all I found this pretty boring and instantly forgettable.",Null,0,1,12 October 2004
Cloverfield," Emperor's new clothes
","Spoilers... Really now, what's to spoil? Story lines don't come any thinner than this. Synopsis: Huge monster appears out of nowhere, destroys city, everybody dies, the end. There isn't any sense of commitment to the main characters, who after the random, gratuitous intro spend their time running around screaming. There is no suspense, no explanation, no point. Predictably, the full view of the monster is saved for last, when even the appalling camera work (yes, I KNOW it's intentional) can't disguise the mediocre CGI, nor the lack of inspiration among the monster-designers. Equally predictable, the nasty foot-soldiers it drops look like big spiders Â– contact with which will make you feel ill and eventually reduce you to an Alien-plagiarism. One does wonder why American filmmakers are so eager to destroy their big cities, especially after 9/11 has provided us with bone chilling imagery that will make any movie of this kind look silly in comparison for decades to come. Not just silly, actually; the way 9/11-like images are opportunistically recycled in this cinematic non-event struck me as rather tasteless. A BBC reviewer quite rightly called it 'plain 9/11 porn'. The makers have worked under the false assumption that 'live', shaky camera-work in dark surroundings will lift it all to a high level of hip artistry, but really, all it does is give you a headache. Any inexperienced klutz suffering from advanced Parkinson would get steadier handycam images than the guy supposedly holding the thing during these exasperating 75 minutes. It's all a very poor Blair Witch rip-off. Add to that the prevailing darkness and half the time you simply haven't got a clue what you're looking at: as a viewer, I felt insulted. This isn't 'intriguing' or 'artistic' or 'novel', it's just sheer, lax arrogance. Avoid at all costs.",1,83,130,22 February 2008
Paranormal Activity," Amazingly overrated
","I've heard people say you won't sleep after seeing this movie. I almost fell asleep watching it. Though PA is often compared to the Blair Witch Project, and though superficially it may seem to share a few of that earlier movie's strengths, in fact it makes the one mistake that BWP so carefully avoided: of showing too much. BWP doesn't show you a single thing that is obviously supernatural; but PA goes all out on fleeting shadows, self-incinerating ouija boards, swinging lamps, billowing sheets, windy living rooms and demon-victims being dragged across the hallway.This is all so terribly over the top that instead of being scary I found it quite ludicrous. Of course the haunted couple never does the obvious things, like switching on the light, closing the bedroom door, or changing sides in the bed (the girl is the one targeted by the 'demon' yet sleeps next to the open door.) I'll grant that the actors aren't doing a bad job, but a lot more is needed to make the antics of this particular demon even remotely believable. Especially as some inconsistencies are pretty glaring. e.g., the paranormal expert Dr. Fredrichs makes it clear he can't do anything for the couple, yet the demon is very angry at his being in the house. Why? The fact that at least three different endings were filmed doesn't say much for the integrity of the entire concept either. It feels pretty much random; a lot of things could have been added or left out without it making much difference. From what I read the original ending is probably more in keeping with the concept of the film than the one now shown in cinema's, that has a demon that's a bit too keen to play for the camera and provide a good, old-fashioned shocker.Great hype. Big yawn.",3,7,13,8 November 2009
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Garbled and unfocused
","To this non-reader of the book, the plot line in this film hardly made any sense at all. There is a great fuss about 'a prophecy' Voldemort needs to get his hands on, but what it is or why he needs it remains unclear almost until the end. And once found, it basically appears to dispense the tacky morale that Voldemort is the true weakling because he'll never know love or friendship. That eventually either he or Potter must die is again not an insight that seems to require any great prophetic gifts. Before these stunning pieces of wisdom are revealed, towards the finale of the movie, the viewer has sat through a prolonged but lame attempt to psycho-dramatize HP. Though Potter ended up as the hero in each of the previous movies, we here find him all of a sudden an inexplicable outcast, old friends suddenly picking fights with him. Are his buddies that fickle? Themes of loneliness and first love crop up, but are handled in a hackneyed and rather embarrassing way. There's much ado about The Kiss, yet at the first setback HP apparently drops his girlfriend like a brick, and without a question asked or a word of explanation offered. The adolescent shouting matches might have been just bearable hadn't the acting been so wooden.Worse, the attempts at realism compromise the mood of magic and surprise that was maintained in one way or another throughout the previous installments. Moments of quasi art-house spareness and puerile introspection do not sit well with the undeniably dazzling visualizations of the magical world - even though some of the latter (the great hall with its magical ceiling; the moving paintings; the brooms etc.) do pale somewhat on their fifth outing. On the other hand the design of the Ministrry of Magic is spectacular to say the least.Many characters merely seem to put in an appearance to remind us that they are still around. New characters do not generally improve matters. Helena Bonham Carter was better as the Corpse Bride; here, she merely overacts. Imelda Staunton, though, is a joy to watch and makes the most of the twisted Umbridge.It all ends with a big wizard fight that looks like 'Lord of the Rings meets The Matrix', and no doubt will satisfy viewers hungry for spectacle. None of it, though, struck me as particularly original, nor very exciting to be honest.Inconsistencies abound, of course. I wondered how it was that nobody could see the thestrals except those 'who have seen death', yet later on Ron and Hermione who couldn't see them before are suddenly flying on their backs. The idea of Umbridge letting herself be lured, all alone, into the woods by the youngsters whom she knows to be her sworn enemies is way of track. And if it is as easy to kill with a spell as we see here, why didn't Malfoy sr., or Voldemort, or Potter for that matter, die ages ago? As I see more of the movies, I not only wonder where it's all going, but I rather get the impression that Mrs. Rowling was wondering the same while writing it all. In the final reckoning, I'd rate OOtP below GoF, and way below PoA, which remains in my view by far the strongest installment to date.",4,1,3,19 July 2007
Pride & Prejudice," Not as authentic as the series, but thoroughly excellent in its own right!
","I went to see this film with a friend who, like me, is a confirmed addict of the BBc 1995 version of P&P. We were utterly prepared to dislike this new version (talk about prejudice...). And we both came out raving. Given the limitations inherent in a 2 hour running time, I find it hard to imagine a more enticing, entrancing way of bringing P&P to the screen. Authenticity is no option in such a time span - if you want close adherence to the book, stick with the series. The movie is not nearly as meticulously researched and takes ample liberties with the sense of propriety and etiquette that governed Austen's genteel circles. In fact, the approach taken in the film is contrasted to the TV-series in almost every aspect, but this has it own rewards. Whereas the series sticks to an authentically early 19th century idiom, and the intimate and provincial feel that is pure Austen, the movie inserts modern day phrases and emotions in Austen's text, and is altogether more worldly, cosmopolitan even. The people are more beautiful by our standards, even though I'm sure the BBC Lizzy and Jane are far closer to the type of woman that would have been considered very beautiful in Austen's days (just look at portraits from that time period). In the series the Bennet's are a seriously dysfunctional family with an aloof father and a hysterical mother, but with a sense of standing intact (as they are in the book); in the film they are a scruffy, chaotic, but lovable and, actually, loving bunch. Brenda Blethyn tones down Mrs. Bennet's madness to a level where she becomes a believable and even sympathetic character. It is not what Austen wanted her to be - her disgust of the character is obvious throughout the book. But it makes for a more involving movie experience. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet is a pleasant surprise, too, even though the make up department might have made some effort to disguise the fact that he has a very good dental plan. Keira Knightley is an excellent Lizzy. Feisty, effervescent, and melancholy in turn, she gets you involved in the character right away. Nor does Matthew MacFadyen need to fear the competition from Colin Firth. He is as dark, brooding and intriguing a Darcy as you could wish for, and his sudden emotional outpouring when he first confesses his love (set amidst the wide rainy vistas of Rosings (in fact, Stourhead) park rather than in the intimacy of Hunsford parsonage) is totally gripping. The movie very much pivots on these two characters, and the achievements of these two actors ensure that the essence of the story is there, completely. Where you loose, inevitably, is in the minor roles. Tom Hollander is, again, a more humanly believable Mr. Collins than we got in the series, but he is also somewhat flat, and does not erase memories of David Bamber's bizarre, yet peculiarly endearing rendition (and, again, Austen meant for Collins to be a comic caricature). Lydia and Wickham are reduced to devices needed to unfold the plot, and even Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is relegated to such a position. Her final confrontation with Lizzy was to me the most disappointing scene from the movie, and is no match for the power Barbara Leigh-Hunt brought to this scene, that ought to feel climactic. (An aristocratic lady of those days, by the way, would never have had such a tan...). All this is more than compensated for by gorgeous imagery. Locations, costumes, crowd scenes, landscapes: they are all stunning. The two balls in the first half of the movie are way more festive, inviting and crowded than the understated formal occasions they are in the series - raucous, too; though again, the series is probably closer to the kind of atmosphere in which people like the Bennet's and the Lucasses would have moved. Burghley as Rosings and Chatsworth and Wilton as Pemberley are way over the top, of course - no matter how grand Mr Darcy and Lady Catherine may look from the Meryton perspective, they most certainly do not belong to the circles of high aristocracy that would in actual fact have lived in houses of that size and splendor. Again, the series is more authentic; but what a feast for the eye these locations offer in the movie! In the end comparing this to the 1995 remake is as pointless as the endless discussions between proponents of period performance in classical music versus those preferring big orchestral versions of Mozart and Beethoven with modern instruments. For Beethoven as Beethoven knew it, you need the former; but the latter can offer no less, and sometimes even more musically and emotionally rewarding experiences. Both are valid in their own way, and we have the luxury of not having to choose, but being able to enjoy both. All in all, and judged on its own merits as a movie, this P&P is wonderful, and very much worthwhile to go and see!",9,6,12,26 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," This time, the magic only comes from the computer
","Let me begin by saying I haven't read any of the books, nor do I plan to, so I'm judging the film for what it is by itself. Basically, after having seen it twice, I remain unconvinced. It lacks the stylistic and narrative coherence of PoA, which remains easily the best of the 4 present HP movies. The first half of GoF in fact was a major disappointment: it seemed HP had fallen to the level of the next thirteen-in-a-dozen CGI action movie, and I expected Bruce Willis to turn op any moment. Sure, the special effects are more than a few notches up from the now endearingly clumsy efforts in part 1, but as we all know by now special effects alone don't make a movie. Fortunately, the second half is rather better. Beautiful imagery all through, and believable and touching emotions accompanying the much anticipated 'Death'. I wish, though, that Radcliffe and Watson would act with a little more spontaneity; maybe HP should stop clenching his jaws all the time? There is a lot of humor in GoF too, which in a way is nice, though incongruous at times. It's also a symptom of this movie trying to be too many things at once. The rock-band at the Xmas ball was one tongue in cheek joke too many, IMHO, and detracted from the believability of Hogwarts. Believability, on the whole, was my main problem with the film, and I suspect that may well be J.K. Rowling's fault rather than anyone else's. Of course the HP stories require 'suspension of disbelief' - but that does not imply that all sense of logic and consistency can just be thrown overboard. Just a few of my niggles:<ul><li>HP is a wizard, isn't he? So why, at crucial moments, doesn't he use magic? </li></ul><ul><li>*spoiler*: The whole point of the plot was to get HP over to the graveyard where Voldemort could get to him. For this aim Barty Crouch Jr. (alias Moody) has changed the Triwizard Cup into a 'portkey'. Why didn't he simply change any object HP would touch into a portkey? - he could have done without the entire tournament, it would have been so much quicker and easier! </li></ul><ul><li>*spoiler*: Why, if Voldemort needs HP's living blood to revive himself, does he force him through a potentially deadly tournament? </li></ul><ul><li>Prof. MacGonagall is deeply shocked when Moody turns Malfoy into a ferret to teach him a lesson - 'We do not use transformation as a punishment'; yet she apparently sees no problem in sending several students into a potentially deadly contest.</li></ul><ul><li>How come HP doesn't recognize Wormtail, whom he met in the previous episode as Peter Pettigrew?</li></ul>Et cetera, et cetera. I'm also bothered by the 'deus ex machina' device that Rowling constantly applies to get HP out of his predicaments - in this case, the sudden and unexplained appearance of his parents. It makes for very unsatisfying plots. The believability of Voldemort isn't helped either by making him into one of those verbose villains who are compelled to give a speech and explain, explain, explain, before coming to the point (after the hilarious gag made of this in The Incredibles, no movie-maker can afford this any longer). Why would an evil man like Voldemort bother?? (Nor could I believe in Crouch Jr as a villain, but that's due to the fact that I only knew David Tennant as the incredibly silly hypocrite Mr. Gibson in 'He knew he was right'...)All in all: good entertainment for viewers who like visual thrills and are focused or sleepy enough not to look too far beyond them.",5,1,2,24 December 2005
Final Destination," Mildly entertaining, but silly and inconsistent
","The beginning is actually quite good, though not recommended for those with fear of flying. Main character Alex gets a vision of the plane he's in, and that's about to airlift him and his classmates to Paris, exploding. He panics, and together with some of his friends gets kicked off. Of course, the plane then explodes as foreseen. Alex has cheated Death. But as he finds out, this simply means that the survivors are still listed to die, and to be sure, soon enough one after the other gets killed in the gruesome and unlikely ways befitting, I suppose, of this genre. It's up to Alex to figure out Death's rules, and to thwart his plan. That's where things become silly. It is the usual problem in horror movies with supernatural forces: the supernatural world behaves so utterly banal and childish that it stops being scary. Why on earth would Death play a game like this? Logic is obviously thrown overboard entirely. Why would a girl who knows she's next in line to die, go outside in a raging thunderstorm where broken, live power lines are lashing about, to rescue her dog? How do Alex and his chums know so exactly where and how they can get into the morgue at night? Why does Alex repeatedly almost die when sheltering in a wood cabin, and why does the strange wind that presages a death blow through the cabin, even though Alex figures out a minute later that it isn't actually his turn yet? How come the three survivors eventually go on for six months without trouble, even though it turns out they are still scheduled to die? Did Death need a break?? I don't even care to wonder about the psychology of the characters, who are able to deal with one friend's gruesome death after another without shedding a single tear. Worst of all are the obligatory FBI men, who for some strange reason do not arrest a kid who is repeatedly found at the scene of violent deaths, and whose fingerprints are found on a knife sticking in a dead body. They do pick him up when a scared teacher sees him in her front yard, but then - ...just let him go again. Huh? And oh yes, of course: when they finally do decide to arrest him, in the middle of the night in a dark wood, they obviously turn on their sirens and lights, so that he can see and hear them coming a mile away, and has plenty of time to escape. In short: if you are feeling in the mood for something fairly dumb, with an occasional effective scare thrown in, as well as a few cute kids to look at, this will do. If you are looking for intelligent entertainment, look elsewhere.",4,2,3,24 October 2005
