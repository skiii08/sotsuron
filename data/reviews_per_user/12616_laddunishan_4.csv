The Hangover," What a Movie between 3 different Characters
","Phil, who is the genius with two other jerks named Stu (the Crazy Doc) & the Stupid but Genius Nerd Alan. OMG, I can't stop laughing when they open the car's Dicky & Mr Cow hits all when he comes out. Fantastic screenplay, Story & Audio effects. Actually I realize that this could happen with anyone, who drunk a lot. but stealing a police car & getting marry with an prostitute.....:O :O :O. People are doing craziest things only when they are drunk too much. And unfortunately that's true & that's what they wanna do in their real life. Doug, who was the first character of movie isn't doing a big part unfortunately. but if he does, may be the movie may be a mess. Any way I would like to thank the CREW of the movie, to making me laugh. Overall movie is a magnificent effort that made me laugh than any other movie.",10,2,3,24 September 2013
Uri: The Surgical Strike," Kya super cool movie.... <3<3
","Can not give 10/10 for this movies and if it is that's call jealous. I gave my full votes and it is because the techniques they used. Vicky Kaushal, the main charactor done the best of best for the movie an the rest is legend..",10,0,1,28 February 2019
The Hangover Part II," Messed Again
","Oh yeah. Here comes the Nerds again.... Common men, have you messed again ???? I can't believe this!! Again, it's Alan. :D :D :D .... Nice trick Alan. If I was there, I would Kill him. Bloody shitty dim bat. The craziest part is when they found Chou & once he ready to tell what happened last night....he stuck on the table.OMG teddy cut his finger himself :(. Again, it's Stu to realize where teddy is. At the end, Chou's speed boat was the only hope. And one thing here. Teddy remembers where is the boat, but non of the others can't. Any way, nice make again. CREW, thanks again. Keep it up. Overall movie is a top rated for me.",9,1,1,24 September 2013
The Croods," Snap-Shot
","OMG, what a movie. Thanks to Kirk De Micco & Chris Sanders for their great effort to make us laugh. Obviously, the whole movie theater was laughing continuously. Funniest thing happens one after one. The team at 'The Croods' used very simple scenes and simple style to make crowed laugh. I was gone crazy when that stupid boy said 'Dad, I don't have a BRAIN' and when they found 'Snap-shot'.I can't stop laughing. And about 3D modeling, they have done maximum effort to touch audience. I saw a little boy is trying to touch trees & asking from his dad 'Dad, why I can't touch those trees. I wanna touch them....'. Finally, I'm crazily awaiting to watch 'The Croods 2' Thanks again.",9,0,0,2 May 2013
