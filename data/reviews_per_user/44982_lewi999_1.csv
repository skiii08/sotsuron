Hereditary," Worth a watch, but don't believe the hype!
","Acclaimed horror of the year?! I thought it was a good dark comedy laugh out loud moments at naked old people and intense silences that became awkward, topped with floating bodies after been possesed. Great acting though! The little girl in it will give you the creeps with that tongue click. Few jumpy moments too but overall disappointed, certainly not scary! Ending disappointing!",5,0,3,1 September 2018
