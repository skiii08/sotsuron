Iron Man 3," A new era in Superhero movies
","I had read many negative reviews about this movie before watching it but now that I have seen it myself, I beg to differ. The problem is that a superhero movie is stereotyped to be an action comedy movie for kids or teenagers. However, the trend is now changed. The superhero movies are now getting more into Drama and emotions. Iron Man 3 and Dark Knight Rises are same in this regard. In both movies, the superhero is seen as a normal person 90% of the movie and wears his costume in the end. But it is bigger than this. Iron Man 3 shows that a superhero is also a human. They can have emotional troubles like other people. Tony is suffering from Panic Attacks, he is having trouble in his personal life as well â€“ Just like normal humans! I think there is a lot to be learned from this movie, if you watch it with an open mind. Don't expect to see Iron man flying here and there killing the bad guys throughout the movie. There is enough action at the end of the movie. I would recommend it to Iron mans, it's a must watch!",Null,1,3,10 June 2013
Now You See Me," Not Bad, Not Great - Just an Average
","When I watched its trailer, I thought it is similar to the Prestige and Illusionist. (By the way I loved both movies). Magic/illusions always fascinate me and it influenced half of my decision to watch this movie, while the other half was supported by the strong cast of this movie like Morgan Freeman, Jesse, Ruffalo, Woody and Isla. Although it does not stand anywhere near Prestige and Illusionist but that doesn't mean it is not a good movie. The movie started off very strongly and created interest immediately. However, as the plot unveiled, it turned out to be an average- Not bad but not great even as expected. As this is an illusion based movie, it keeps the viewer confused for most of the time and reveals answers in end. The acting was good, although the character building was weak. The movie still entertains till the last seen.",Null,0,4,10 June 2013
The Hangover Part III," A big disappointment.
","From hangover 1 to 3, it is a constant downward graph of entertainment. I loved the first movie and somehow accepted the second as an average but this is truly a disgrace. The storyline was very weak, although acting was good but that was not enough. The plot was too stupid and short, hard to believe that it came from same brilliant minds who made the first movie. It seemed like everyone in this movie were forced to work on this project. Although there were some funny moments by Zach, who was the main character in this movie. Other characters like Bradely and Helms were merely a supporting cast in this movie. Everyone can easily skip this movie and watch the first Hangover movie again!",Null,1,2,10 June 2013
