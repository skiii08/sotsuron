The Avengers," A fantastic Marvel adventure
","I've always watched Marvel films but I've never been the greatest fan of them. I find them entertaining but they are often similar and rarely deliver quite such the memorable and action-packed experience that 'Avengers Assemble' offers. Seriously, whether you are a Marvel fan or not, give this film a chance, it may very well surprise you.I can't think of any particularly large faults to this movie that are worth mentioning, the plot isn't exactly unique but that's not what I saw as the purpose of the film. The film's plot tied together the previous Marvel films featuring heroes such as Iron Man and Captain America very well, it then went on to set up and deliver a roller coaster ride of sci-fi action unlike anything I've ever seen before in a Marvel film.'Avengers Assemble' certainly beats the previous films in terms of CGI, action, characters and memorability. From the opinions of friends, I know that the film has even appealed to those that aren't directly a fan of sci-fi action. There is certainly something about the film that simply stuns the viewer and impresses them with up-to-date visuals and a fast-paced storyline. A fact worth mentioning is that, unlike previous films, 'Avengers Assemble' doesn't take itself too seriously. It's not a comedy, or a parody, but it does allow for humorous moments that actually made me smile more than some actual comedies have. This allows you to enjoy the film further I feel, rather than taking away the more serious elements.If you haven't seen the film already, make sure to find the time to watch it, it will entertain you in some way or another and is definitely worth at least one viewing. Truly one of the better movies of the past decade.",10,6,11,12 August 2012
Ted," A standard comedy - but with a teddy bear
","Whilst I did not dislike 'Ted' I cannot say I was overly impressed by it. The hype and popularity that built up towards the film's release had me expecting something fresh, something that would keep me laughing days after. To my disappointment, 'Ted', to me, turned out to just another Rom-Com, its only real unique twist being Ted himself. Having said that, 'Ted' did provide some good laughs, whilst they weren't exactly side-splitting the film was entertaining and I did watch the entire feature without getting bored or uninterested. The animations for Ted were of a good quality, doing a good job in making it seem like Ted was actually there with the actors, rather than just a computer-generated 3D image. What I felt let 'Ted' down was it's predictability and lack of memorable or unique laughs. Being rated as a 15, 'Ted's plot didn't seem to suit it's targeted audience, I have seen similar story lines in films rated PG or even U but the explicit content of 'Ted' was clearly intended for more mature audiences, therefore I felt it deserved a more mature plot. Overall, I'd recommend 'Ted' to those who are looking for a relatively light-hearted story with a few giggles added in and a cursing, yet somehow still lovable, teddy bear. It's good, but nothing overly special.",6,68,120,12 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," A brilliant end to a brilliant trilogy
","Christopher Nolan's version of the Batman universe is truly one of the most realistic and immersive versions I have seen. Whilst I'm not a major Batman fan, Nolan's trilogy had me hooked from the beginning. The films are mature and well-made, the characters are relatable and believable, the villains can be genuinely terrifying and the plot flows beautifully, never giving room for dull moments.'The Dark Knigh Rises' is, in particular, the best of the trilogy and rightfully so, being the conclusion it certainly deserves to be called a grand finale. The cast, as usual, were perfect for their roles, new introductions such as Tom Hardy giving top performances and those from previous films, such as Christian Bale obviously, kept the standards high, if not raised them.The movie definitely has the greatest scale to it, the shear size of the cast on screen at certain times shows how much effort and manpower has gone into making the film the stunning experience that it is. The movie takes elements from the previous films and combines them, raising the stakes in every way it can. The plot itself is even more gripping, the action more intense. For those that have seen the entire trilogy, you are made to feel this world that Nolan successfully draws us into over the course of the three films is in peril and you, as the viewer, begin to feel for it as much as those in the movie itself.Once again, the plot is not as predictable as you might think, containing plenty of twists. It isn't always simply spoon-fed to you as with many hero-based films. I recommend watching the previous two films before this to truly appreciate this epic conclusion, however, even if you don't, the action-packed journey the movie takes you on should still have you greatly satisfied by the end.This series stands out to me, from many other hero films, due to its maturity, its scale and the effort put in that can clearly be seen in all aspects, including the performances from the actors themselves. As a movie, it delivers everything you could expect and more, so even if you aren't a Batman fan, this film should appeal to you, providing you can appreciate a well-made film when you see one.",10,7,14,12 August 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Just what the horror genre needed
","Over the years, the horror genre, particular the 'slasher films', have slowly deteriorated, with the odd shining star now and again. Needless to say, many of the films placed into the horror category follow virtually identical plots, only differing in location and characters. The reason 'The Cabin in the Woods' succeeds therefore, is because it recognises this cloning of horror films and turns it on its head.The writers of the film took the clich√© genre and made into something very clever and unique, taking many viewers by surprise and giving me hope for the future of the horror genre. The film wasn't riddled with scares and I won't be losing any sleep because of it, but 'The Cabin in the Woods', despite all its twist, is still a horror. It has blood, tension, killers and a nice dark, clever plot to glue it all together.To begin with, I found the film's concept quite confusing and, before realising what the writers had done, found it rather far-fetched. If anyone is unsure of what goes on in the film, watch it first and then look it up if you still aren't sure as it may change your opinion of it.I don't wish to ruin any of the story, so I shall finish by saying 'The Cabin in the Woods' was a refreshing experience, written by creative minds and featuring a well-formed cast, supported by well-made special effects. If any of you are tired of watching the same old slasher-horror movies, you will certainly appreciate this film.",8,9,17,12 August 2012
