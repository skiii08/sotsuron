The Avengers," Great Superhero movie for Kids but nowhere near what I expected!
","OK glad to start doing reviews on IMDb. The Avengers 'WHAT A MOVIE' seems to be the line on everybody's lips. Well I am going to say after seeing it both 3D and 2D that I can make an honest objective opinion.The special effects which whether you like it or not is one of the movie's highlights. YES they are GOOD and nicely done BUT why the 3D? Why did I pay for a 3D movie where the 3D was never used in his pure awesomeness? Yes it's cheesy and cheap to see boulders, pieces of buildings tires, arrows explosions and all sort of stuff flying towards you but it's ALSO FUN & that's why you go to see it in 3D. Well let me tell you this movie HAS NONE of that. No Sir it's just simple digital 3D shots of New York and other stuff! NOTHING SPECIAL...sad to see that after 3-4 years AVATAR still holds the CROWN it should give you an idea about this.Acting is good all the way to great. AND YES Tony Stark (Robert Downey JR. steals the show) which can be good if your a fan like me but can also be bad for the rest of the crew. He is great the others are OK. HULK is amazing but then again he is CGI!The story and here is where it starts to get annoying. Guys some of these characters did not have they're own movie so it's hard to relate to them get to care for them especially when you won't have enough time to do so...So why so much Black Widow? Then again why no drama no connections between them. I honestly expected to see Captain America fall for Black Widow as the comic books say. Still it's the 1st part so there is time but make's you feel like you haven't been treated with the whole cake but a cookie.Going to the action scene is where I get disappointed! Alien Invasion??? Where in the middle of New York with no real damage to the city. What happened to the BIG BOOMS and explosions. Where the hell was the ARMY? Where were all those special weapons STARK created for so long. Where the hell was WAR MACHINE as the Air Force Commander. No Sir here you will only see a bunch of cops (fat ones also) fighting alongside our 6 fellas to protect the city. And the only idea the government has is to NUKE the city 10 minutes after the invasion. Very ORIGINAL it was one of those sad moments in my life as a movie enthusiast where I actually did MISSED Michael Bay and his explosions and action scenes. Again you can make an idea about the War Scene.Ending this review with my last disappointment! I know I know it'a a PG movie but PLEASE stop making it so if you going to loose every bit of drama left in the movie. Yes you won't see swearing in the movie or blood or naked women or at least people dying. NO NO this is a kids movie with superheroes that is no where near as good as IMDb score is now. I felt cheated because my expectation for this movie were huge!Final conclusion both the new SpiderMan & Batman are going to swipe the floor with this movie so PLEASE stop calling it the BEST SUPERHERO MOVIE OF THE YEAR!",7,4,12,7 May 2012
