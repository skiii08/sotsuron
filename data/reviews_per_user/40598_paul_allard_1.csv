Blade Runner 2049," Half-hour too long and over loud music - even for a partially-deaf person
","Just some criticisms Music far too loud, especially compared to the dialogue. Half-hour too long, possibly caused by too many long looks at post-apocalyptic landscapes (yes, they are well done but still ...) and definitely because Ryan Gosling walks everywhere at a snail's pace!Enjoyed the film and it's well worth a look but cut it down, director",7,4,10,9 October 2017
