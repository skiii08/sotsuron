Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More complex than the trilogy plot-wise, and highly underrated.
","I don't understand why people think the plot of 'Phantom' is infantile compared to the other entries of the trilogy. I mean, the others hardly had a plot. A New Hope was simply a shoot-em-up, with the ultimate goal being to destroy a big battle station. ESB was a chase movie. ROTJ was similar to the first, but with more plot. What worked with the series is the fact that it had interesting characters and, of course, the whole Anakin/Vader subplot. However, TPM's plot works on many levels, it's just that people can't seem to understand it. If they did, it would probably make a lot more sense. First off, everybody's asking: 'Why did the Nimoudians blockade Naboo?' The answer is simple-in case you haven't figured it out yet, Senator Palpatine(The senator who Amidalia confers with on Coruscant) is in fact, Darth Sidious. He wants Naboo blockaded so it will generate strong sympathy towards him in the Senate, so he can become Supreme Chancellor. If the occupation treaty is signed, he'll get even more pity. However, it's not necessary to his overall scheme that the Neimoudians win-it would just *enhance* his chances. As for Maul, he's sent to reassure the Nimoudians, and also to get rid of those pesky Jedi, since Palpatine hates the Jedi anyway. Either way, whether the bad guys win or lose, it all goes down in Palpatine's favor. As for Jake Lloyd, the kid honestly wasn't that bad. Look at it this way-at least it wasn't the Jerry Macquire kid. The only major problem with the film is Jar-Jar, but George Lucas has taken notice of this and has lessened his role and toned down his character for Episode II. Anyway, most of the problems this film had-honestly problems people are complaining about WAY too much when they could be doing something productive-will probably be fixed with Episode II, as it appears from early reports.",Null,0,0,18 December 2000
X-Men," Great even if you're not a fan of the comic book
","I used to read the comic a few years ago, but ultiametly lost interest. However, I decided to see the 'X-men' movie to see if Marvel had finally managed to create a decent live-action adaptation of one of their superhero series('The Incredible Hulk' wasn't exactly true to the comic, and who can forget the disasters of 'Captain America' 'The Punisher' and 'The Fantastic Four'?). As it turns out, they've suceeded in putting together a great film, which works far much better than the 'Superman' and 'Batman' films. Featuring great acting and SFX, you can't miss this one.",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," An excellent finale to an excellent series.
","'Return of the Jedi' wraps up the original trilogy of 'Star Wars' films with incredible special effects and quick pacing. Although not as deep as Empire, it's still an incredibly fun movie. Following the events in Empire, The Rebel Alliance is poised to strike a Deathblow to the empire, which has constructed a new Death Star. Meanwhile, Luke, Leia and Lando infiltrate the fortress of Jabba The Hutt in order to rescue the frozen Han Solo. 'Return' has some amazing action sequences-we get to see the Lightsaber used in other ways apart from dueling, and also a stunning multi-level battle which sets a new standard in cinematic spectacle(And which was emulated to a degree in Episode I). As for performances, they're a little less focused than in Empire, but there still is greatness, especially in the supporting characters. Denis Lawson, the surviving pilot from the first film and who also had a cameo in Empire, gets to shine here, as does Ian Mcdiarmid as the fierce Emperor Palpatine, a character that will be expanded as the prequels continue to unravel the backstory.",Null,0,1,8 January 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Like The Phantom Menace, a misunderstood follow-up
","'The Lost World' is actually not a horrible film, and will probably be healed by time, just like Spielberg's other follow-up to one of his blockbusters, 'Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom' or his buddy George Lucas's 'Phantom Menace', which people are finally starting to accept. In fact, two of the top review sites, have implied that The Lost World is actually BETTER than the original. After all, what were your expectations anyway? The film had to have a sequel-the first film made nearly a billion dollars, and the door was certainly opened for a follow-up (Unlike 'Titanic'). Anyway, if you remove the gymnastics scene, The Lost World is pretty good. Heck, even the T-rex in San Diego scene is kind of entertaining, especially when you notice all the visual jokes. I mean, what were you expecting? The T-rex to start belting out showtunes? If I'm not mistaken, people were expecting Dinosaurs on the mainland, did they not? Well, you asked for it, you got it. The film features some well-crafted action scenes-particually the trailer scene. While some may argue that it's simply a redux of JP's T-rex break-out, there is enough originality in this scene to make it stand out on it's own(such as the glass cracking scene). With the addition of the scenes, the film fares much better. As for the plot, it suffers mainly from a lot of cut scenes, some of which have been restored on the DVD. Mainly, scenes mentioning exactly why Ingen needs a new park, an intoxicated Ludow accidentally crushing the infant rex's tail, the introduction of Tembo and Arjay, etc. As for the acting, I thought Jeff Goldblum did an okay job, although apart from the one-liners he barely resembles the character from Jurassic Park. Vince Vaughn and Richard Schiff are entertaining as the supporting characters, and Pete Postelwaite captures the character of Roland Tembo perfectly. Julianne Moore and Vannesa Lee Chester could have done better though...also, they could've touched on the relationship between Ian and Sarah a little, how she nursed him back to health after the JP incident etc. I'm not saying this film is flawless, but I think calling it one of the worst films ever is a little harsh. BTW Jurassic Park III will arrive soon, and for those naysayers, initial reports are that the script is well done and Sam Neill and Laura Dern will return to their roles, and also they've fired TLW's screenwriter....but with the negativity that has surrounded JP of late, it'll take a lot for it to succeed.",Null,0,0,14 December 2000
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A superb foreign film
","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a superb film that once again proves that Asian cinema is not just badly-dubbed Godzilla and Jackie Chan films. Crouching succeeds on three levels-it's a captivating drama, a great love story, and also a superb action film. The superb performances of the actors manages to cross launguage barriers and give us very believable and sympathetic characters. It's really hard to hate any of them, even the villainous Jade Fox. The visual effects and choreography bend the laws of physics and make even 'The Matrix' look like an amateurish effort. The cinamatography is also very beautiful-there are glorious views of bamboo forests and desolate mountain ranges. A superb film-GO SEE IT!",Null,0,0,11 March 2001
A Bug's Life," Good, but Pixar can do better
","Although it's well done and infinitely better compared to the highly overrated 'Antz', I couldn't help feeling dissapointed by this film, especially when compared to other Pixar offerings. Perhaps it's the fact that the jokes are forced compared to Toy Story, or maybe the fact that ants don't look as convincing as toys do. Dave Foley sounds a little too starry-eyed, which is a little out of character for his usual, pessimistic self seen in 'Newsradio' and his various 'Kids In The Hall' characters. He was clearly uncomfortable doing a film like this. Anyway, better than Antz, but not as good as the two 'Toy Story' films.",Null,0,0,18 December 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A true classic
","The popularity of Star Wars has been slipping somewhat lately-there was this tremendous build up to 'Phantom', but now things have fizzled somewhat as people have walked out of the film either enthralled or really dissiapointed. There's still quiet hype for 'Episode II' though. The original-Episode IV-still holds up well, and the revelations in Episode I help enhance the movie somewhat, and raises a few questions. It's especially shocking to see Vader and Obi-Wan duel, after their first meeting in Episode I, and also it's interesting to think that the villanous Darth Vader was a young kid who raced in pods. Weird! The acting of Hammil and Fisher isn't exactly Oscar caliber, and the Imperial soldiers sound for the most part like their voices haven't broke yet-but there are some superb persomances by Harrison Ford, Alec Quinness and Peter Cushing. The film is a roller-coaster ride from beginning to end, although it drags in the rather unnecessary first half of the Trash compacter sequence, which is also the most annoying part of the film. The 'Special Edition' enhances some of the dated effects, and adds some unnecessary new ones(Jabba and the Greedo shot), but it failed to fix the most obvious mistake, when Obi-Wan's saber suddenly shrinks during his battle with Vader. Overall, a fun and exhilirating film, enhanced by the revelations in Episode I, but those looking for more serious fare should look elsewhere.",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The darkest in the series...
","Empire takes us from the bright colors of 'Star Wars' to the desolate whites and greys of 'Empire'. The film takes place a few years after the first, where the Rebels have been forced to evacuate their jungle planet fortress for an icy hide-out. However, things get complicated when the Empire forces them to escape. As the base evacuates, Luke journeys on a quest to learn more about the force while his friends in the Millenium Falcon become hounded by an Imperial fleet directly under the command of Darth Vader and aided by a group of skilled bounty hunters. This all leads up to one of the most stunning conclusions in motion picture history. Although 'Empire' is, when you come down to it, a chase movie, it manages to rise above it with stunning visual FX(The effects are so good they were hardly touched up at all for the special editions) and direction by Irvin Kershner. Even Mark Hammil gives a powerful performance as Luke.",Null,0,0,8 January 2001
Gladiator," One of the best films of 2000
","In a year that featured more misses than hits, there were some diamonds in the rough. Among these was Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator'. 'Gladiator' is sort of a departure for Ridley, who usually is into features portraying a dark and depressing future('Alien' 'Blade Runner'). Gladiator is a period move, but is not exactly historically accurate-for instance, there was no 'Maximus' and Commudus ruled far longer than the span of time in the movie. But regardless of this, it's still a compelling story, pulled off convincingly with excellent performances by Russel Crowe(Maximus) and Waiken Pheonix(Commudius). There are also some nifty battle scenes, particually the Battle of Carthage recreation. I wasn't too big a fan of the Romans vs. the Germans battle at the beginning though-the editing was just a little too strange. But overall, the film is pretty good, and I wouldn't be suprised if it gets nominated for a few Oscars(Especially considering the slim pickings this year)",Null,0,0,17 December 2000
Princess Mononoke," This film should've been in Pokemon's place
","Princess Mononoke is an excellent anime film by one of the best animators outside of the United States, Hayao Miyazaki. Although this film is deriative of some of Miyazaki's older works(Nausicca, for example, has a female protagonist and a pro-nature theme), it still is very entertaining, with fluid animation, backgrounds, a capitivating story, interesting characters and so on. The characters are drawn in the typical Miyazaki style, which has remained the same for the last 20 years, ever since Miyazaki made his debut with 'Future Boy Conan'. This style is closer to traditional anime then 'Ghost In The Shell' or 'Akira' but it has it's own charm. Unfortunately, this film didn't do too well at the Box office, instead Pikachu and co., which are on the other end of the anime spectrum, got adaquete marketing and became a box office hit, scaring about half the USA away from anime in the process.",Null,0,1,14 December 2000
