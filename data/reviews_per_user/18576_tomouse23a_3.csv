Mission: Impossible III," Really a shame, could have been great...wasn't!
","I love LOVE mission impossible BUT!!! This movie I am SO sad to say is only worth seeing for the theme tune and the parts where they say 'This tape will self-destruct in 5 seconds' and 'your mission should you choose to accept it' Really, there's loads of pointless dialogue and stupid crappy gunfights, why couldn't they just make it good like the 1st one. Sure I love guns stunts and bombs but the only really good scene in this film was the Vatican cos it was actually suspenseful and clever unlike the rest of the film, I feel so let down by JJ Abrams whom I believe to be not as good as people say. I also think this film has a formula, it goes: Pointless Talk, Guns, Bombs, Pointless Talk, Guns Bombs....thats it; there are some decent parts but there's really nothing that makes this film special. Go and see it because I believe you all should have a say, but in my opinion its average at best....maybe even avoidable.",7,3,6,5 May 2006
Match Point," Amazing, A masterpiece
","I went to see this film knowing the ending after being told by a friend, I didn't expect much as I have never been a huge Allen fan, but this blew me away, the way it was written was original and engaging, the music 'clicked' perfectly with the scenes and the cinematography and every performance was top notch and some performances such as Johanssons were the best I had seen from that actor. The script made me feel as if I was there and the actions taken by the characters were interesting and gripping. Allen deserves an Oscar for writing and directing and John Rhys-Meyers deserves an Oscar for his part, what the hell!!! Oscars for the whole cast and Allen!!! One of the best films I have EVER seen without a doubt!",9,11,18,8 January 2006
War of the Worlds," Terrible!
","I was excited about seeing this, every time i saw a trailer i got more and more excited, i saw it and was totally let down, the special effects were nothing new, the acting was average at its best, the family were your typical TV dysfunctional family,Single Parents, Dad who never sees his kids, Rebellious son and brainy daughter, kinda like the Simpsons! Anyway its all run run run, a little emotion scattered here and there but that was all tosh, the aliens ruined the whole thing, they were all cute and big eyed. Playing around with bicycle wheels and falling over each other, and every time anything attacks Tom Cruise would escape; unscathed. I was let down a great deal, but keep my faith in Spielberg because of Indy!! I would say don't go to see this and expect to come back pleased, its two hours of your life you'll never get back!",3,14,34,2 July 2005
