Iron Man 3," ...i choose to see this movie as being misunderstood by fans of the comic...
","i see all the fans of the iron-man comics are all heated up and gave this movie very lukewarm reviews and meanwhile most critics liked it. i think i know why...you see...once upon a time i was a huge fan of comic books and iron-man was one of my favorites. as i recall the main gripe i have and every comic fan out there is that they really did injustice to the main villain, if you've read the comic then you'll understand.even though i use to be a comic book fan, i am also a movie fan too! i see this movie in the same light that the critics do and i would actually give this movie an 8. you see, if you just ignore the huge change they made to the main villain compared to the comic, then the movie stands up very well on its own.come on people, how can you not like a movie with a cast including : will sadler, miguel ferrer, rebecca hall, guy pearce, robert downey jr,don cheadle and more and everybody looked like they were having fun doing this movie. besides that you also have a very strong message about private corporation sponsored custom made terrorists. that is a very real and scary threat, all you need is one big nut-job in a high position to do so.the special effects are worth a mention, they were spectacular and for people that said it was slow and not enough action, i say phooey, it had as much as the previous two and the pacing i felt was better also.the movie had a nice intelligent script and very competent actors and if you are a fan of twists in movies, this one has a few.so...all you iron-man comic book fans have to try to cool off and watch this movie and see and relate to it as a movie and then give your opinion. for me personally, this is the 4th time i've watched the movie and unlike the other comic book movies this one seems to get better with every viewing.if you were to leave the comic book fans out of the voting( there is a lot of them it seems ) and just leave it to the critics and fans of movies then this movie would at least be an 8 on IMDb.",8,26,43,5 March 2014
Mississippi Burning," the truth was far worse
","my summary line is actually what another reviewer who lived in Mississippi( during depicted time) and gave this movie i believe only 3 stars wrote in his review. this reviewer i believe is white and the only reason he gave this movie 3 stars was because he...and i also feel this way, felt that ' the truth was far worse ' and the depictions of the movie didn't do the Evil justice. in other words it was a lot worse then the movie depicted. evil is not spread by the idiots that commit the hate crimes but by the people who hold the power and want to hold on to that power. the strong will always bully the weak and only in rare occasions does it not happen, which just goes to show that ' man doesn't learn from history( as much as hes studying it )and is doomed to keep on repeating mistakes made thru-out history. it make not be crystal clear today but i know for a fact that there is a lot of racism in southern America, its just hushed up that's all! hey look at it this way to prove my point of ' the strong bullying the weak...its not even about the color of the skin' take for example certain parts of Africa where there's no whites around...its black on black and what about north Korea, where its yellow on yellow.OK, i'm rambling a little now but the movie although it wasn't the truth-fullest depiction was still very very good and will stand the test of time as a classic. just movie-wise how can you not like a movie with ( hackman, dafoe and mcdormand in it. the movie gets a 8 because it had great acting, directing and was brave enough to touch upon a touchy matter.",8,0,1,2 March 2014
The Book Thief," ...pre thru post world war 2 as seen thru the eyes of a child
","every time you get hyped up for a movie even if its good it a lot of times doesn't live up to the hyped up expectations. well, these is one of those sweet times where the movie actually live up to those expectations.this is one of the best movies i've watched in the last few years. everything about the movie was beautiful...from the acting to the cinematography, to the well paced movement of the movie even though it was over 2 hours long.the 2 main child leads in this movie were spectacular and the boy that played Rudy, the book thiefs friend almost stole the show. almost...the main girl actress is even more wonderful and Emily Watson and Geofrey Rush as the book thiefs adoptive parents were their usual solid great selves.i see this movie as being an all time classic and played during the holidays especially in the future. very very good movie, don't miss out on it, it'll make you mad, sad, happy, sentimental...the works!",8,1,3,24 March 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," forget about how good the movie is...it teaches kids that everybody is different and special and to be comfortable in your own shoes
","everybody is raving about how good the movie is and i totally agree but there was a message in the movie for kids about morality, the choices we make and that everybody is different and special and that is what i felt most while watching this movie. i think every parent should watch this movie with their kids and have a talk afterwards and the world would be in a better place.aside from that the movie was AWESOME and this is coming from a 40 year old man. this is a movie for all ages, its funny and rousing and sad and touching all at the same time. Kudos to the people that came up with this movie. its entertaining and has strong life lessons in it for kids.",7,0,1,6 October 2014
Frozen," not frozened!...,it's a heartwarmer for any age
","just got done watching this on blu ray and i must say that the first thing that hit me while watching this movie was the animation and the cgi. both of those qualities were outstanding, but the longer i watched, i realized that everything about this movie was outstanding and top notch. i'm not a big fan of musicals and this i think is at least a semi-musical movie and the fact that it was didn't bother me at all. this movie was enjoyable from beginning to end and i would recommend this to fans of movies of any genre or any age...there's something that will appeal to everybody and as an animated motion picture it should rate at least a 9 out of 10. just want to give a special mention to the cgi and special effect....wow! for u guys out there into action and special effects, don't fret cause there is plenty here. they are as good or ahead of anything that is out at this time.frozen, i think...should warm everybodies heart and if it doesn't then they seriously got big problems and issues(sorry to say). this movie should go into a lot of people's favorite movies list and for sure a classic that people will remember. ENJOY EVERYBODY!!!!!!oh, btw...that song( let it go ) is so darn catchy hahaha, so...people, just let it go(no pun intended) and let Elsa and her sister take you and whoever is watching with you on a breathtaking adventure.",8,3,5,28 February 2014
The Lives of Others," My eyes couldn't stay dry for the last 4/5ths of the movie
","almost a perfect movie...mesmerized me from beginning to end. to me...it was a perfect movie. this is a movie for anybody who has a soul. please...please...anybody who sees this review...watch this movie. i promise that you will like and be moved by the story it has to tell. just finished watching it a little while ago...still stunned and my eyes are still burning. in my opinion...easily one of the best 15 movies of the 21st century...easily. don't know what else to write really....just watch the movie and get mesmerized by it. lose yourself in its world for 2 hrs. and 15 minutes, the time will seem to fly by. kudos to the director...N...especially for the actor who portrayed the stasi captain....what a performance...should've at least been nominated for best actors Oscar for the year 2006....a shame really that this masterpiece does'nt get a really really wide audience...this is a movie for everybody. if you read this review and watched the movie....please spread the word about this beautiful movie.",9,2,5,4 February 2016
Everest," ...what?..no good or bad guys in the film...uhhhh...Sandy Pittman Hill...
","the devil was there that day in the guise of Sandy Pittman Hill. if she was'nt there, there probably would have been a few less deaths or none at all. but i'm not going to write about that, you can all google that if interested...although even if you google, she is so rich and has so many powerful friends that there's not much bad written about her. the movie itself was a great watch, the special effects were awesome and just the place itself puts one in awe. this is the type of movie that will get your heartrate up, you can almost feel yourself there. when they had to gasp for air i felt myself gasping for air too. this is what an adventure action movie should feel like. all in all..a well spent 2 hrs living the adventure on mount everest...Bravo!",7,0,1,12 February 2016
Snowden," one of the top 15 films of the year
",filmed way different then the other movies Stone has done in the past. fascinating subject matter...i remember when this happened..it still doesn't get enough attention by the public mass and thats just what the people on the other end involved in all these events want. important to watch this film and awaken yourself to the fact that the u.s. gov't is not controlled and runed by the people for the people..but actually controlled by a faceless few who are more interested in keeping their profits up and controlling world power. J G. Leavitt does another bang-up job and should receive a Oscar nomination come that time of year. i was actually surprise and pleased at seeing how many big acting names appear in this movie in cameos...i particularly enjoyed nick cage and tim olyphant. this is scary stuff and it is a scary world we now reside in where a few shadowy people with nothing but their own interests in mind controll the political leaders of the world. what would be of best in the interests' and well being of the public mass is to upheave all politicians and start over...alas...that is not possible. even the good ones are controlled by the shadow people. funny how most people don't even know that the Federal Reserve is not controlled by any gov't but by private citizens with their own interests. both bushes...sr. and jr. should be in jail....shame on them. great movie...should help open more shut eyes and make us question more the motives of some people in our gov't.,8,3,8,15 November 2016
The Legend of 1900," critics be damned...
","...critics be damned...how can you work and get paid for watching movies and not like this movie? as a testament, even with the critics hating it the film is still solidly rated at 8.1 stars as i'm writing this review.no Oscar nominations for this film...in my opinion...best actor, supporting actor, best film, best director and best score..but alas...not one.the story itself has been reviewed to death already by other reviewers already so i wouldn't step there. what i can say is that the story moved me to tears on multiple occasions..heartfelt tears...i've watched just about all the good ones and plenty of bad ones too...none has moved me to tears so many times in one viewing. just about everyone that shed a tear watching this movie shed tears at different segments of the movie although just about everyone cried at the end.i watched the original version...close to 3 hrs. long and not the 2 hr. version. great story, cinematopgraphy, score and of course the direction.in my humble opinion...the director tornatore is a treasure on the global scale...i've watched a few of his films where i can find them and they have all stayed in my memory.againnnn....professional critics be damned for hating a masterpiece....not 1 Oscar nomination either...what a joke and farce the people in Hollywood are.",8,1,3,3 February 2017
Blade Runner," yes!...a good movie with every scene shot at night and with rain
","i know that there is like already countless reviews on this site of this movie, but i just want to put in my own opinion on this movie. i saw the final-cut of this movie and just want to know...why is there no sequel? with the ambiguous ending in the final-cut i now want a sequel expanding on Deckard and Rachels relationship.there has been so many arguments regarding liking and disliking of this movie and after 30 years if the debate is still going on its a great movie otherwise there wouldn't be a debate.i feel personally that this is director Ridley Scotts best film and that even though upon its initial release it bombed, he has not attained any standard even close to what he attained in this movie.for the people that said it was to dark and every setting was night- time, whats wrong with that, just make sure you have a good copy of this movie, hopefully the blu-ray and you'll be amazed at the color schematics of this movie and a lot of the effects hold up even in this day.John Woo, Luc Besson, Wong Kar Wai and even yes Michael Bay...i see in some of their works therein shades of this movie. so this is a very very influential movie and a lot of stuff in this movie has been oft-copied. those four i mentioned were just off the top of my head.finally, a movie consisting of almost all night scenes and with some occasional rain, that is a personal favorite of mine and very hard to find in a movie, almost impossible as a matter of fact. besides being set at nighttime the shots were so beautiful and haunting that it burns a vivid picture in your brain, you actually had to watch the movie and use your brain, so its a no no for like 50% of the general movie mass. the special effects were spectacular for its time and still look very good in this day and age. the movie also featured a great ensemble cast with good performances from everybody and i thought the stand-outs were Rutger Hauer and Edward J. Olmos. so in short..., we have a great ensemble cast with major Hollywood A- list actors included, great special effects for its time, a great sci-fi short story written by Phil K Dick, one of the most hauntingly beautifully shot films(in my opinion) and one of the greatest directors of ours or any time and a thought provoking and argument causing theme. so what is there not to like about the movie??? one of the great American films and in my mind a magical achievement which director Scott will never top.definitely requires multiple viewings and then multiple viewings on top of that.",9,0,4,9 April 2014
Identity," ...whores don't get second chances...
","...i've watched this film multiple times over the years and it never gets boring, there is always something new that i have not noticed before. first off, i would like to say that James Mangold is one of the best directors around who probably no one has heard of. you don't have to give him a big budget for him to make a good movie. he did ' 3:10 to Yuma ' on something like 20 million dollars and most of the money went to the 2 huge leads ( Christian bale and Russell crowe ), and that movie looked like a 60 million dollar picture...which still isn't a big budget.this movie in my opinion has so many good things going for it and i would give it a little higher then an 8 except Amanda peete's acting was just a little bit weak compared to everybody else's. i personally am a big fan of her's though and she's gotten a lot better over the years, where i think she can carry a feature film by herself now.the night scenes...the constant rain( less then 1 minute of the film had no rain or thunder and lighting ). i love that type of atmosphere and you can look high and dry and go blind before you find another movie with all rain and at night...trust me, i tried.the photography was great, there was a lot of tension and suspense. there are plenty of twist and turns in this movie and one great one. great mystery slasher flick...you are not going to find many of this caliber, one of Mangold's best if not his best.all in all you can't go wrong with this movie as a movie fan as it is so well done. i believe that if you do watch this movie and enjoyed it you will watch this movie many more times over the coming years. for some reason this movie just stays on my mind over the years. a great gem that i think not many people know about and to me a timeless classic ' who done it ?
