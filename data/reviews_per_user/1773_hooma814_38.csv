First Man," First Man
","First man was wonderful depiction of the grim reality of not only the Moon Landings but of an inspirational decade or so of Neil Armstrong's life. Being an astronaut (especially in this time) looks flippen hard! Not only knowledge wise but this film shows the impact it can have on your body, emotional state and well being, not to mention the well being of all your friends and family!Behind every great man is an even greater woman! Its excellent to see the story told of Janet's struggle and her boss moments of assertion towards NASA when the radio cuts out, leaving her in the dark about whether Neil was alive or not.This movie was a bit slow at times and got to the point where it felt almost done and then you realised you were only halfway. But if you can put up the slog and get on board with the grief the characters carry, then this is a solid enjoyable movie.",7,0,0,5 June 2020
Scarface," 'Say hello to my little friend!!!'
","This movie was epic!
Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to end. I had always wondered why Al Pacino was so highly regarded. After watching this and the Godfather its now clear why. He gave such an authentic performance, it was hard not to believe that Al Pacino was not in fact Tony himself. The opening and ending scenes for me were some of the best. The brillance of Tony's quick thinking mind to be able to stand up to anyone. He really was fearless, standing up to all these people. But at the same time he was so broken. There was so much character development in one story, unlike many I had seen before. The cast and the set design as well as the music all contributed so well to take this movie to the next level. And of course the ending, it was so satisfiying to see where the famous one liner had come from. Tony himself had me cracking up at different points too. 'You done boss? Can I go?' As his boss tries to intimidate him. Fantastic movie and more enjoyable for me than The Godfather.",9,2,2,23 February 2020
Darkest Hour," Goes well with Dunkirk!
","This movie was insightful to say the least. I feel like there are so many stories that come out of the war that I never knew. I expect many more to keep being told, and maybe some will never be told. But the story of Winston Churchill's rise to power and the struggles he went through was captivating to say the least.Being someone born 50 years after WW2 ending I always appreciate insight into what actually went on at this time. This movie has made visiting g the Churchill war rooms in London much more interesting, something I never really understood why it was a tourist attraction previously.The setting of this movie was well executed and fitting of the title. Different shots of London from a birds eye view, or the whole city covered in darkness really added to whole feel of the movie.I'd recommend using subtitles on this movie when trying to understand what Winston is actually saying. Although it's easy to see why Gary Oldman was nominated for some many awards for this role. He has played so many different roles that I've actually forgotten what he actually looks like. How can Winston Churhcill, Commissioner Gordon and Sirius Black all be played by the same actor. His facial brand isn't as highly recognizable as someone like Brad Pitt who can be seen in any role. Maybe this is a much truer mark of a great actor.This movie goes exceptionally coupled with Dunkirk, giving another insight into the life of what some of these political decisions meant for the soldiers on the ground.Great movie though and the roles are all played by some excellent actors.",8,0,3,10 March 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A sequel is always going to be harder to follow (unless its Lord of the Rings)
","Pirates does well do add an interesting story line in Dead Man's Chest, but it was always going to struggle to be better than the Curse of the Black Pearl. This story got a bit more outrageous and over the top. With Jack becoming the King/Chieftain of a whole village on a remote island, to some exaggerated action scenes with the pirates swinging in a giant ball and climbing up the cliff or the giant wheel battle. Although it does stick out in my mind as entertaining and memorable. But just a bit over the top. The characters all return in good strength, and the movie is enjoyable, not enough to get me fizzed and watch every movie in the series.",7,0,0,21 June 2020
Concussion," Interesting and captivating!
","Concussion is a very interesting watch! I was glad to find that most of it was accurate to the real story. Will Smith was a class act as always, securing another movie, as to why he one of the best.Its sad to think that since some of these findings in the early 2000's that sport hasn't had drastic change to the rules and penalising of players within all contact sport. I'd be intrigued to see whether these reports and movies have resulted in less sport participation, I'd imagine it hasn't really.Great movie to watch with a group, and right my alley in terms of a true story, excellent actors and you feel like you learn something once you've watched it.",8,0,0,28 March 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," Putting a Kiwi in charge was always a good idea!
","Ragnarok has such a different feel to it to the previous Thor movies and it was a move in the right direction.
Thor is easily more likeable under the direction of Taika Waititi. He was able to make sure that no one was taking themselves too seriously. The use of music was epic, especially the heavy rock at the beginning and end of the movie.Korg was such a funny character. I've loved every character that Taika has played in all his movies, and Korg is high up there. He does so much for his few scenes.
Thor vs Hulk was also a fantastic scene. Such good humour. There was a nice touch of having two antagonists with Jeff Goldblum and Cate Blanchett each with seperate motivations made a more interesting story other than good versus evil.Great to see a few kiwis brought along with Taika with strong performances from Karl Urban and Rachel House.The only loop hole in the movie for me was the fact the Thor could destory Surtur the fire monster at the beginning of the movie. But then Hela could easily destory Thor but then couldn't equally destory Surtur? This seemed confusing and we're left to put the pieces together to accept this is ok because Surtur grew much stronger (and bigger) by being born again with the eternal flame and also he grows through being in Asgard.Great work from Taika again and great to see the kiwi humour being on the big screen.",8,1,6,9 April 2020
Ready Player One," Great movie for when a group can't decide on what to watch.
","Ready Player One is a great film to watch in a group setting. Easy to follow, interesting story, not too many characters, modern, a crowd pleaser. I can imagine most camps enjoying or at least liking this film, apart from intense critic snobs who would ride this film off as predictable, average villains, and cliched, all true I would argue. But sometimes its nice to watch a crowd pleasing film, where you don't have to think very hard, the visuals are pleasing and you know the good guys will win. We're not always in the mood for dark, deep thinking, serious movies. This film seems quite likely considering I was helping children recently develop their own avatars. Interesting ethical dilemmas of actions in RPG's having real world consequences of people actually dying. All things we must be ready for in the not to distant future. Great film if you're needing to watch a movie in the evening with a big group and you've spent almost an hour scrolling through Netflix deciding what everyone feels like watching.",7,0,0,23 February 2020
The Hateful Eight," Too violent and gross for me
","The violence was just too much for me, the guy giving Samuel L Jackson head was uncomfortable and the whole movie just felt out of place. What is a kiwi accent doing in America in the 1800s? Hard to endure this movie. Great scenery though, that kept me interested",5,1,4,12 April 2020
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," It was everything I wasnt hoping for.
","This is just another average marvel movie. Cheesy one liners with weak corporate villains, lame sods characters and an ok main character. I don't know what it is about Captain America, but hes not the superhero I'd want to hang out with. Hes almost robotic, the patriotism and hero nature of his character over bears who he really is. His personality doesn't come through clearly. Which means you just watching another action movie where you know the good guy will always win no matter how ridiculous the scenarios get. At one point he gets shot in his back, at this point I wonder how on earth has he gone this long without getting shot? I thought they were playing on the fact that his body could repel bullets. Of he can be shot, why has no one ever gone to shoot his legs underneath his shield?And speaking of shield, these guys ruin the whole movie for me. I could not care less about villains on a hologram screen in suits telling one top dog all the ways they've gone wrong. The sooner they're out the better.You could miss this whole movie in the marvel series and not notice. In fact I did do this. This is the main marker in the fact that this movie does nothing for Captain Americas character development or the overall story!",4,0,1,10 March 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," Why did they bother?
","The only reason I felt compelled to keep watching this movie is that fact that its quite well known and the actors in it are all pretty good (minus George Clooney). But did they really need to drain every last drip of enjoyment out of the films by producing another Ocean's? Just another classic example of US producers making crap movies to draw people into get as much sales as they can. This film had no originality and seemed exactly the same as Ocean's 11, what was the point of making a copy? Things always seemed to go perfectly for Danny Ocean and the whole criminal world was centred in on American white boys. I'm glad more recent movies have branched out into including other parts of the world in a genuine way, unlike the racial undertones in reference to Shaobo Qin's character. It reminded me of movies like Transformers where the robots landed by chance in USA, bearing in mind 70% of the earth is water. I feel like this movie would've been better if wasn't just trying to take the piss the whole time and replaced the smug criminals with people that actually seemed like they could pull it off. I don't really get why this movie series has become famous, other than the fact that it has Clooney, Pitt, and Damon altogether on one screen.",4,0,1,3 June 2020
Doctor Strange," Marvel have found a way to keep their movies new and fresh again!
","Doctor Strange was a very unique in its style, and the powers available for the heroes. Marvel did a great job of moving the buildings in ways unlike any other movie I'd seen, other than Inception, I think Marvel did it even better. The ways the characters could run sideways along rooms or buildings, as well as jumping through time holes into new areas.The development of Strange's character was well done. His arrogance is constantly being broken down scene after scene until he finally relents and realises that its not about him.The CGI and camerwork was excellent. The cape that flies onto Doctor Strange was even humourous. They were able to make an inatimate object seem alive and interesting.It was great to finally have some settings outside of London and New York. Being in Kathmandu, Nepal was refreshing. It's arrogant to think that time and time again that Superheroes would only ever be found in USA or UK. Super hero movies are more often than not set in these western settings.The Eastern setting was a welcome change and the new cast was quirky and intriguing. Benedict Wong was funny and added a lot to the overall feel over the movie.The casting of Rachel McAdams felt like Marvel just trying their hardest to try and get as many famous actors involved in the MCU as possible. She was a key actor and did really well. But she could've equally been an actor that was not as well known. Movie after movie, it seems like they have a man as the main superhero and then try to have an attractive, famous supporting actress to try and get more ratings.Overall a much bigger improvement from some of the earlier movies in the Marvel universe. Doctor Strange easily becomes one of my favourite superheroes and he is full of dominating power. His story also advances the overall story with the inclusion of the infinity stone.",7,1,1,7 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," So many questions
","Emperor Palpatine, what? How? He's had sex? With who? How did this come about?There were so many questions I had throughout, I was so confused. How did Palpatine come back? How did they figure this out, and who did this?/ Exegol, if this is such a hard planet to get to then how the heck did those 1000's of Star Destroyers get there? Already I was off on tangents like who is running these ships and how do they get food? They'll be lacking some serious vitamin D. They must be sooo bored, waiting in formation for what must've been at least weeks.And Palpatine, really? Did this franchise really not have any new ideas other than Palpatine, Vader and a rebellion resulting in stopping planets being destroyed? Haven't I seen this, at least 3 times already. They really don't branch out from their story. There are so many things wrong with bringing Palpatine back, why does no one care that he potentially has a son and that this should've been known from the beginning going back to episode 1? It makes no sense. What it seems like is the writers ran out of good ideas and thought that bringing old timers back would put a plaster over gaping wounds and plot holes. But it just revealed it more and made a mockery really. I would be surprised to find a Star Wars fan who doesn't find the idea of Palpatine hard to get on board with.Having Lando come back was not a bad option, if you we're going to have all the others then why not?Although the movie just flops throughout really. It doesn't build much anticipation at all throughout the desert scenes. They're on the hunt for a dagger, you knew they were going to get to Exegol anyway, but I didn't really care in the build up. Rey going all Neo in the 3rd Matrix and healing the snake was just another example of rule breaking. I guess they can just do what they want?The remains of the Death Star was probably my favourite part of the movie. This actually felt interesting (minus the Rey succeeding in everything she touches - riding a boat in a tsunami like waters - Obviously the failures in something like Tom Hanks in Castaway would've been more realistic) Rey dealing with the allure of the dark side and a great battle with Kylo Ren. The waves and moody setting were a good backdrop to finally have some good battles. But the healing was again just too much.R2- D2 is again relegated to nothing more than forgetful lame droid. How can it be that if you only watched this trilogy you potentially might not even know who he is. If you're going to put R2-D2 in the films, don't sideline him and treat him like a hunk of junk, do his character some justice and show respect to that absolutely vital roles he played in the originals. Obviously just repeats the common trends of how today's society treats the old.Lastly is the Palpatine face off. He demands that she kills him for his spirit to pass into Rey. But then Rey later kills him and nothing happens? Rey killing Palpatine was pretty cool, it had a good summary of encapsulating the whole of the Jedi's. But this is overshadowed by the weird kiss between Rey and Ben? This was so out of place, even fans I've watched it with were outwardly expressing their confusion.But hey who cares? The resistance won and thats it, right? Just like at the end of 6. Obviously if there is a resistance that overcomes and wins there is no need for a resistance anymore, they fill the void. But somehow we ended up with the resistance being out of power again come Episode 7. So no doubt, even though the resistance won, there will probably be another worse trilogy where Palpatine comes back yet again and they need to stop all the Star Destroyers, because these writers are incapable of writing new content.Safe to say I'm done with Star Wars and they ran it into the ground. I think I'd only watch it if Taika Waititi was directing, he seems about the only one who can redeem this franchise, like he did with Thor.",3,5,6,6 June 2020
Ant-Man," A good laugh
","Paul Rudd was such a good choice for this movie! He is crack up and makes it a good watch. Marvel have done well in being able to keep reinventing themselves and never taking themselves too seriously. Ant Man is a great edition to the Marvel universe. It seems fresh, unique and quirky.Ant Man is the superhero we can all relate to. He's the fanboy being in awe of the Avengers, not feeling part of the team. He's clumsy and makes lots of mistakes, as a new superhero should.Michael Pena was also very funny with his mates. His one liners gave the movie a light jokey feel throughout. Evangeline lilly was also a strong supporting actress, although her hairstyle seemed a bit odd.Marvel does seem to have an odd increase in its advertising though by this point. From around these movies onwards it seems to inlcude a lot more advertising than usual. Most notably Baskin Robbins and the very obvious product placement throughout the whole movies.Ant Man is a great watch and helps to bring these later Marvel movies some of the best",8,0,0,3 April 2020
She's the Man," Lame!
","I've had to endure this movie 3 times now, and I think I enjoy less each time. Obviously at the time it came it out it would've been a laugh... if you were under 12. But these days its just classic Amanda Bynes cringe! This is only good to those who loved when they were kids.",5,0,0,3 June 2020
Dunkirk," Not Nolans best but still epic!
","This movie needs to be watched at least twice.The first time I watched it I went in with expectations high knowing it was another Nolan creation with him being my favourite director. He couldn't seem to put a foot wrong. But you do yourself a bit of a disservice if you go in to Dunkirk expecting to see something like Interstellar, Inception or The Prestige. If you do this movie can be easily misunderstood as slow, boring, no action. However it is definitely not. It all depends on your expectations coming into it.This is also Nolans first movie based on a historical event. Which means it is very much a stand alone work from his previous. But like all great Nolan films he plays around with time, and in this you see three stories told on three different speeds all converging in one event.It took me right until the end before I realised this was happening. Hence watching it a second time. Watching it twice gives you the chance to see the little clues and perspectives that start to overlap that can be missed on one viewing.What's interesting about this movie is the lack of character development despite the movie still remaining very interesting. There is very little background info on who any of these soldiers or civilians are. There is also no antagonist full present in one character. The villain is found in the German army but not in one person
The enemy is faceless and only appears out of the silence in the form of a very quick nose dive or bustling torpedo. Which seems much more accurate with many of the soldiers probably never really meeting their enemy face to face.Although these characters are fictional, the story is very real and authentic. The beach setting and plane especially.This movie is awesome and I'm glad I gave it another go.",8,0,0,10 March 2020
Captain America: Civil War," Better than Age of Ultron! Has enough characters to be another Avengers!
","This movies plays out the many who would win between ____ & ____? It was fun to see certain heroes combos fighting each other, and the introduction of newer characters was done smoothly. Spiderman, Ant man and Black Panther solid in their performances. The fight between all the heroes in Berlin was easily the best part of the whole movie. Even watching it a second time I was waiting eagerly to see this scene again.Captain America and his story seemed to play second fiddle to the over arching civil war. His romance was a bit a of a waste time, especially in the fact that his love story has hardly any return in the next few MCU movies. His bromance with Bucky was interesting enought to keep watching over the length of two movies.The humour was relatively absent from any scenes including Captain America. The only laughs to be had were when other characters were in the scene.Ironman almost gets more character development than Captain America through learning to submit and not be so proud. How does Captain America change as a result of this movie? He has asserted himself as a capable leader and a sacrifical friend. But I had hoped for a bit more. Although this movie is a much better Avengers movie than Age of Ultron. A better story and a much more relatable enemy, and even the enemy within your own heroes.",7,0,1,7 April 2020
Yesterday," Quirky and unique storytelling
","Yesterday was such a random story that honours the history of The Beetles in a clever and thoughtful way. After seeing it get a rather low IMDB score of 6 I was expecting a lot worse. But the humour throughout kept me well interested.I'd never spent much time admiring the Beetles music, so I too sort of felt like one of the members of the crowd learning the songs for the first time. Its great as you see the lyrics drop into Jack's memory as he struggles to piece them together. As someone who is not a songwriter it was intriguing to see this process played out in such visual ways - taking inspiration from everyday life.This movie shed important insight into the creative process of artists from grassroots to business management, and shows how sad it is the ways in which companies can completely take over and change the direction/vision of the original artist.The love interest is another classic of friendzoning and frustrating the audience with back and forward moments where it seems so close. Despite this it comes to a satisfying happily ever after, which is not the worst ending I suppose.",7,1,1,3 June 2020
Avengers: Endgame," This is what movies are all about!
","This was a film to be watched in the cinema on a first watch. The three hours flew by and literally felt like an hour and a half. It was everything I wanted and it was all for that last scene. For me there has almost been no greater villain to be triumphed over than Thanos. I was so emotional when all of the returned heroes come back to join Ironman, Captain America and Thor. The moment had been built up for so long and it was so rewarding to see it come through. I was able to hear a lot of this early enough before everyone was able to offload their expectations onto me.Is this movie the best movie ever? No. Does it have some big plot holes or over the top exaggerations? Yes. Time travel, Thor holding open and sustaining the blast of a sun, and the return of Gomorah and the fact that Nebula doesn't cease to exist when she shoots her past self in the head, just to name a few.But I dont care. This movie wasnt made to be correct. It was more to inspire and to uplift and boy did it do that. I'm able to excuse the faults for its fantastic strengths. Including Ironmans ultimate sacrifice, making him in my opinion the best Avenger.This movie was ultimately one of my best experiences in a theatre. It was so entertaining and needs to be what movies at the theatre are all about. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity to see something amazing.Upon watching it a second time it's not as good, especially out of the movies. Lots of plot holes and definitely didnt feel like an hour and a half this time.But still one of my favourite movies and definitely in my top 10. If you didnt see it in the movies it's still good but I think you missed your chance.",9,0,8,12 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Bringing back all the feels!
","My expectations for Toy Story 4 were low considering how the previous installment had gone. So I was super stoked throughout the whole movie when I realised how much more of a success this one was going to be.Toy Story 4 is the perfect blend of nostalgia for its original audience ('You've got a friend in me' goes without saying), combined with different settings and characters for its newer audience, as well as great character development and emotional investment. It wasn't trying too hard to bring back all the jokes and tip offs to previous movies, yet it still felt really familiar, being in a child's room at the start, flying out the windows, all the characters together. It still felt modern too, with new characters and significantly better animation when compared to the first Toy Story.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen were a class act as well. Great one liners as usual. Buzz's inner voices jokes esepecially. The emotion at the end of Buzz and Woody having to say goodbye was excellent, it felt like watching the finale of Friends. Saying goodbye to old friends (So much history).Bo Peep's reintroduction and character development was clever and kept it exciting. Her scene in the atinques store showing Woody up on many occassions was necssary as Woody had just gone too long on being the one in charge and showing everyone else what to do. Her almost bar like scene reminded me of Star Wars with the trumpets and all the aliens in the bar. Great chance to show off a variety of funny toys.Although, poor old Buzz was definitely side-lined in this movie and was much more of a side character, and that goes for the whole gang actually, they felt like they were not even part of the movie to be honest. Maybe it was for lack of time, but a few extra scenes of these characters doing something funny would've added extra roundedness to the whole series. They just felt a bit forgotten when compared to the first two movies.The new characters were mostly successful I'd say. Ducky and Bunny had some great scenes together and we're an easy win for the younger audience who no doubt would have went away recalling some of their scenes. Gabby was creepy enough with her minions (perfect choice of creepy dolls, who doesn't hate those things), her purposes were made clear and were pretty rationale. The build up to her being reunited with her child was made to be quite brutal when her child just threw her away. This was quite effective and hopefully got children thinking about not just wanting the newest and coolest toy to only use once or twice before throwing it away.Forky though was a bit of a hit and miss for me. It doesn't quite make sense that the human capabilities of the toys can be passed onto anything that is made and crafted. What about all the other things that are made in arts and crafts? It seemed to push the past the limits of what was reasonable in this world. Lastly, Duke was great fun, and hilarious at times., had to rate his jump when he surprsingly hit his head going for his 40 foot jump.Overall I found myself cracking up at the jokes, being quite invested in the story and satisfied with the finish at the end. Woody did have that annoying Batman quality to him where he always had to do the right thing. But it makes sense with his character. This movie for me was well worth putting the time and effort into and will be one I'll look forward to watching again in a few years time.",8,0,1,20 February 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," I forgot how good this was!
","Infinity war is fantastic!It and Endgame make watching all the previous MCU movies so worth it. The best part is seeing a villain be truly powerful and ultimately to the point of defeat. After watching movie after movie of the superheroes coming out top, never really losing anything meaningful to them. We get a much better look at who these characters are when they've lost all around them. Thor especially is interesting to see him continually getting broken down.Thanos' minions were a waste of time. They were quickly dispatched, especially the crew on the ship.Gamorah and Nebula were excellent again. I pretty much really enjoy any scene they're in. Their character arcs are again advanced well in this movie especially with the death of Gamorah. Lucky Thanos came with someone to sacrifice, otherwise he'd be a bit stuck.I appreciated the pace of the movie in the fact that it didnt drag out over two or three movies for Thanos to get the stones, instead it increased the fear by the urgency required as he gathered all six. As you knew more and more that they were going to lose, it forces you to be more invested and the anxiety is much more intense, with such a high point of ending.It was also so good having all the characters together, working together. This was well balanced and trumped Avengers 1 and 2. They moved on from trying to have cool 360 degree fighting shots to actually advancing the story. And in fact the fight scenes they did have were much smoother with panning from character to character.Good to see Paul Rudd and Hawk eye side lined for family that makes sense.All of this I picked up on my first watch and loved it all. However rewatching this two years later I had forgotten how good it actually was. This movie has a lot of rewatch ability. Some people are anti superhero movies but these last films are a different breed and a must watch.",9,1,2,12 April 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A little slow, although unique and enjoyable
","Not Tarantino's best film but I still found it worth the watch. The story is one that I'd never really considered 1960s Hollywood. To be honest I thought it was set in 1930s Hollywood when I'd heard about the Golden Age of Hollywood. However, the story did seem very random and strange. Maybe more for Quentins enjoyment than his audience? A film he'd always wanted to make, as part of his 10 movies.The story felt a bit long at times, but made sense as you slowly started to see what the point of the movie was. Which was, how do we cope with growing out of a role that weve been so well known and loved for. How do you reinvent yourself when you leave your career? Something all of us face, classically described as the mid-life crisis.The ending of the movie was probably the best part for me. Although very violent, it was the characters redemption where they again find their new path out of the mid-life crisis.The flamethrower scene was epic and actually left me quite shocked. A hard scene to stay quiet for watching on a plane.Margot Robbie was in the movie less than I thought she'd be, and the hippie scenes left me quite uncomfortable. But overall once you get the idea of the movie, how the three characters relate to each other and what this time was all about the film becomes quite entertaining, and probably worth a second watch in a few years time.Still one of the best directors in my opinion.",7,2,2,24 March 2020
Million Dollar Baby," Great acting and very moving!
","Hillary Swank is captivating to watch, her relentless determination is inspiring you almost want it to be a true story. Hillary has also done an incredible job to get fit for this role, she looks like she could take on boxing as a new career path. Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman were also very good. Although it was a little hard to heas the dialogue of these actors at times. The movie had a shock twist ending with Swanks death. The fact that Clint could get in and out of the hospital and kill a patient undetected was a bit ridiculous. Nonetheless their relationship was the true champion of the film. Their back and forward, honest and cheeky relationship was a joy to watch and gives you hope that it's never too late to make new friends or start mentoring someone. This is a great story about what a true family and friendship is and what it can look like to fulfill your dreams.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The last hope.... I've lost hope in anything quality coming from Star Wars
","Episode VIII was unsurprisingly worse than Episode VII. I had little hope going into this and I left it having even less belief in this franchise.The Last Jedi begins by majoring on the wrong things from the get go. Po, Leia and the space battles against the First Order. I already had baggage with this coming into these scenes. Po comes across way too snarky and immature, and the battles are just cliche, boring action scenes reminding me of Michael Bay. This is all topped off with the absolutely ridiculous Mary Poppins moment where Leia somehow survives being in space and flies back into the ship!!! I literally burst out laughing at this absurdity. How did this get the all clear for going ahead for the final cut?Things don't get any better with Luke and Rey's story. It doesn't make any sense why in a few minutes they would derail the whole point of the previous movie when Luke decides to throw away his light saber? This made the whole point of the last movie a waste of time. Luke comes across as a whiny teenager and although it's cool to not have a different actor to age and look like Luke e.g. like Young Solo in Solo, but you actually have the real Luke Skywalker aged perfectly. But just because it is the real Mark Hammel doesn't mean he will still be a good actor. Maybe there is a reason he hasn't been in other well known films.Kylo Renn and Rey's connection baffles me, how does it work? Why has there never been a connection like this between Jedi's or Sith before? If anyone has the case to have this kind of connection its probably Luke and Leia since they're flippen twins! Yoda also seems to have way too much power coming back from the dead!Then to make mattes worse, what the heck was up with this casino scene with Finn and Rose? This was way off kilter and felt totally out of place. Plus Rose's acting just really grinds my gears. It didn't feel slick or smooth, yet again.Holdo gets way too much screen time and is wasted when time could've been spent on the main characters. Again with the space battles, who cares?Then last of all is Snoke. Who is this guy? Where has he come from? And surely we will get to see such a big battle scene displaying his power, like something Star Wars has brought out in the past (some of the best villain battles of all time - Vader, Maul and Sidious). But instead we are left with some lame side character one hit kill, without any struggle at all really and some weird battle with red lego men afterwards. How on earth did they manage to go another whole movie without any serious light saber battles. I mean the old ones with worse CGI still made epic battle with Yoda. This battle should've been the big finale, but they major on some average teenage rant between Luke and Kylo Ren. How did Luke manage to make himself teleport as something more than a hologram, being able to fight! Why didn't he do this before?Rose and Finn kissing! What? When they're friends are casually being killed in the background, when in Rome I guess? This was odd and Finn was much better suited to be with Rey in my opinion. How did this romance develop so quick, over the space of a few scenes. Didn't they just meet?This movie was absolutely ridiculous and I have lost hope for anything better.",4,3,3,5 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Redeems Marvel!
","By this point in the Marvel Universe I'd really lost interest units predictable and boring plot. Captain America, IronMan and Thor were not doing it for me. I remember giving up on the franchise altogether at this point. That is until Guardians of the Galaxy. The first time I watched it, it seemed so new and such a change for Marvel. Although watching it a second time in the context of Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther and End Game (even Ant-man and Doctor Strange) it just seemed like the new normal. It didn't seem so new and outrageous.This movie helped to bring my interest back in the whole Marvel movies altogether. The strength of this movie is its supporting cast. I think all the previous Marvel movies had strong lead actors, this is even more true with Chris Pratt. But they always had such average supporting actors. They were boring, one dimensional and took away from the story rather than contributing to it. Guardians however, has an excellent cast. It goes from strength to strength with the wity humour, logical and clear motivations, character development and emotional investment. I actually care about these characters. Unlike Thors b team of friends.Guardians other strengths are definitely its villains that move outside of shield or Hydra. Man shield is so lame. And its use of music.Right from the start the music sets the tone of what you're in for and it feels so fresh and different. Its light hearted and anything but cheesy.It also moves the overarching plot along with some relevant clues towards Thanos and his motivations.Guardians is a great movie and redeems everything that marvel should be.",8,0,0,10 March 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The weakest avengers movie, but still good
","This movie is a bit hard to remember what even happened. A lot of it is quite forgettable. They story doesn't really get advanced at all for any of the characters apart from a general distrust for Tony Stark and the birth of Vision. Ultron was average. Just another bad guy who was always going to lose, no one really cares. This was just another chance for the Avengers crew to get together and film some 360 degree fight scene. You always knew that no one significant was going to get hurt. Iron man was always going to get hurt beyond belief and have all the gunshots come his way. But Captain America and Black Widow can go bullet free. The Avengers movies are always a chance to show the weakest links which are blatantly Hawk Eye and Black Widow. Both can be left out and it wouldn't make much difference to the overall fight. But the others really contribute to the overall strength of the Avengers.This movie is still a good watch, but definitely the weakest out of the four Avengers movies.",6,1,1,3 April 2020
2001: A Space Odyssey," What have I just watched????
","This movie was beyond me. It had some classic scenes that were obviously very well made, especially considering the time in which it was made. Before the actual moon landings!!! But despite this I got completely lost towards the end. I'm trying to write an honest review of my own thoughts before reading everyone elses to figure out what actually happened.The opening 2 minutes of darkness was an interesting start, I thought for a while something was wrong with my computer. I could imagine when this first came out it would've turned a few heads. The feeling of being lost in space and the music accompanying it was tense to say the least.Hearing The Blue Danube was fantastic. To be able to hear this piece of music used in such an epic way. No wonder it became something to be repeated in many other films and shows. So much so I had to google whether this movie even came up with the piece itself. This really exposed my lack of knowledge to see it was composed in the 1800s.From here the scenes involving the monkeys were awesome. Were those backgrounds hand painted? And were those actors in monkey suits? From here you could tell we were in for a wild ride. I began to think we were going to get a whole story of humanity. The quick development of the monkeys from individuals to tribes was an interesting take. And the introduction of the black rectangle/slab was complete surprise. I especially liked the part when the monkey was tenatively going back and forth trying to touch the slab, little by little. Oh so much tension. Just touch the bloody thing already!The quick switch here to the 'modern' day was done well and got quite exciting. A story I could follow. As it went on I was intriqued, even up until the cover up story about the slab being on the moon. The music here especially was so intense, I felt like I was about to pop. I could think of a few people especially who would've given up at this point, but I soildered on. Were the monkey scenes actually taking place on the moon millions of years before humans? Were these aliens taking over all the planets? My mind was racing.Next I was definitely impressed by the number of long scenes filmed with the actors walking up side down, going about their spaceship duties. How on earth did they come up with this sort of film trickery in the 1960's. This no doubt wouldb've blown the original audiences minds. It blew mine.The robot HAL was creepy and completely untrustworthy. The subtle camera shots to and from the red eye always watching or the circle lens shots giving us HAL's point of view were done very well. However these scenes were also very boring at times. I feel like I'd done well not to skip anything so far. These long drawn out scenes were tense, but without the music they would've been the most boring scenes ever. Men talking five minutes to walk down a hill. So by the time it got to just breathing, I will admit I had to skip the odd 30secs with no apparent huge plot going missing. Until HAL suddenly kills one of the astronauts. WHAT!From here for me, it went all down hill. It was great to see HAL be taken down. But the last act for me completely lost me and takes my overall rating from a 7 or 8 to 6. There was no solid explanation of the black slabs, and what was going on with the colours/dimensions? I thought he was going to Jupiter? Then the main astronaut ends up in the weird as mental institute looking room (Classic chance for jump scares). Here the man ages in three stages and then bam the rectangle is there again and he turns into a giant floating baby? The graphics were so old school I actually burst out laughing. And what? He then flies to earth and becomes the new alien spieces? I had no idea. Were the black rectangles aliens? Could they turn old men into giant floating babies in bubbles? Who knows?Overall, great soundtrack, epic opening scenes that are an instant classic and something that was an experience thats for sure. I'm looking forward to reading others' reviews to see if I got anywhere close to understanding this or if others felt the same way. No doubt it would of generated a lot of discussion back in the day. I know I'm curious and a bit on edge.",6,0,1,20 February 2020
Singin' in the Rain," Epic dance and singing scenes!
","This movie is full of talent. Best of all was Donald O'Connors solo, including unbelievable flips and plenty of carpet burn moments - I guess Homer Simpson didn't do the running in a circle on the ground first! Amazing all without a stunt man. I can see why some people take something like La La Land and say it doesn't have good enough dancing when you compare to something like this. This is so well rehearsed and choreographed that even if I didn't really get into the story as much it was just worth it for the dancing talent.Movies of this era seem to have some real issues with the pitch of a women's voice. Many of them sound very whinny and screechy! Gone with the wind would be another example.The story does get a bit weird throughout the middle part of this movie though, like La La Land with the flying scenes. But this was not that big of a deal in the end.Obviously the Singin in the Rain number was a great hit, and its nice to be able to see where a classic began. Would happily watch this again.",8,0,0,5 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," They've done it again!
","Marvel has made a superhero movie how it should be made! This movie again is fresh, funny and interesting the whole time. This is so much better than some of the earlier movies that come before it. And as far as sequels go, this does a great job of not sucking like most other sequels.The opening scene is so smart and unique, with focus being on baby Groot (who is such a great character, loved by many I'm sure) whilst the characters battle in the background. It was funny and it gets the main idea of what superhero movies need to be about, the characters! Not action. Action should always be secondary or in the background and the character development always needs to be central. The superhero movies that have all action have never been rated very highly.From here the movie goes from strength to strength with the cast being the real powerhouse. Every character is likeable, Drax for me especially I found hilarious! His laugh and dry honest comments were always appreciated.One issue I did have with the movie was the spaceship scene, flying through the comets, seemed like an exact copy of a scene out of the original Star Wars triology. Plus it then got quite far fetched when Gomorrah caught a flying Draw in the spaceship and then proceeded to hold onto a piece of the ship whilst holding Drax for a ridiculous amount of time. This was too far fetched and needed to be rewritten.Peter Quill and his father was an interesting story, and had some good twists and jokes throughout. The development of what it means to be a father vs a Dad was also playd out well throughout the second half of the movie.Rocket also gets some important screen time to rise up as a hero alongside Yondu. Both of these characters get redemption in the end and Yondu's sacrifice was emotional and made sense.The only other problem I had with the movie was the fact that they threw people out into space to die and they were dead with a matter of seconds, however when Peter Quill is thrown out into space in the previous movie he gets at least 20 seconds of life before being taken into a ship and still survives. This doesn't line up, but could be excused for Peter's god like abilities.Overall this was another great edition to the Marvel Universe and ultimately if it wasn't for these strong contributions, I would ultimately not care about Marvel at all. These characters play a siginficant part in making Marvel what it is today. Well worth a watch!",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Great action and humour! But not much overall story development.
","This movie was all about Harry, Ron and Hermione. They got all the screen time. Which was good and funny at times, with Ron and Hermione having some awkward interactions. However this was at the expense of telling the overall story of good vs evil. Both in the book and in the movie the dark magic just comes in too late for me. This needs to be present in a much clearer way. Harry has the odd moment of his scar burning and his reocurring dream.But the movie seems to waste a lot of time being interested in the dynamics of the main trio. Snape gets hardly any time, Moody gets one scene teaching, Dumbledore is here and there. The champions of the tornament have literally one line each. Karkaroff has no part in it. It really is just Harry, Ron and Hermione, which is enjoyable, but limits the movie from being great!A shame to see Dobby and Hermione's scene with her wanting to help house elf's cut, alongside Harry falling on the trick step and nearly getting caught by Snape, until Moody comes along. The movie did Harry's scene with the dragon way better though, its pretty much a non-event in the book. Although they rush many parts of Harry's training and development, alongside his being coached by Sirius and just assume that Harry now knows how to do these new charms and spells from reading it with Hermione. But, the movie is already 2 1/2 hours long so something has to give right? (I'd say less of the trio and more development of the overall arc of good vs evil).Ron was great at the Yule Ball, the costume design was hilarious!Overall, its enjoyable, but not great.",7,0,0,29 February 2020
Joker," This was such a good movie!
","What a great movie! I was very impressed with this whole movie beginning to end. Going into it I had heard mixed reviews, some that loved it and others that thought it was too dark. But I thought it was perfectly balanced throughout.I had been wondering recently about how some people like the Joker, are created. Is it a state of mind that is with them from birth, that's just who they are, or is it more to do with their environment, in those who shape and hurt them. Joker, does such a good job of showing how significant the environment around someone can bring out the villain in them. He loses everything, all of his significant loved ones, friends and heroes that layer by layer the Joker is pushed closer into existance. This makes for such a believable villain compared to cliche bad guys who just want to kill everyone and hurt people because they want lots of money or power. This type of story is boring and unrelatable. It doesn't force me to think about how to treat others, it just teaches me to look out for the odd person out there who is really bad.The joker however is such a compelling story that it forces you to consider how you treat every single person and whether your actions are bringing out the joker in someone else. The bullying from all those around the Joker and the way others mock and ridicule him, show us that they are actually the true villains.This movie makes sense, its smart and well thought out. I really struggle to come up with any plot holes of that let it down. This is such a nice relief and joy when compared to the sloppy movie making of many other directors and writers out there. Every one of the Joker's decisions is understandable, it makes sense why he shoots his attackers, or why he chooses to kill his hero instead of himself. The movie builds itself in logical steps so that when these things happen, its shocking, but it still makes sense. You can see why his character would choose to do this. Whereas many other villains often make terrible choices, ones that are unrelatable and do not make sense with his character.Joaquin Phoenix was a masterclass and put in such a great performance. It felt like he was literally in every scene. It looks also like he put his body through a huge strain to get it to a place where he is quite bony and looking unwell. He was so authentic and bold as well, in his dancing, laughing and even the spit running down his nose in one scene, he really commits everything for this role, regardless of what others will think. The supporting actors really help to drive the plot, but they are so secondary that it actually works well to contribute to pushing the focus back towards the Joker. His character development is the ultimate win of this whole movie, who he becomes from who he starts out as is completely different. He changes in almost everyway. He loses himself and becomes a new person, he becomes the Joker.Overall this movie is epic. It makes you think, its smart and shocking and definitely in my top list of favourite movies. In my opinion its not too dark, I think the Joker in the Dark Knight was darker and creepier. This joker is relatable and conjures up a lot of empathy. I hope this movie can teach us all to make sure we treat all those in society with the love that they all deserve.",9,2,2,25 March 2020
Finding Dory," Worth the reboot!
","This was a great adventure taking us back into a much loved world of Nemo. Finding Dory, delivered in many ways that made a great sequel where others have failed. It doesn't try to make the same jokes. By focusing on Dory and her short term memory loss, the story felt really fresh but still relevant as it absolutely nails the graphics of under sea life. The visuals are incredible and have no doubt given children across the world a sense of wonder at what lives under the sea. The story was interesting and it did a good job of introducing new characters that were helpful and not annoying, unlike something like Toy Story 4 where the new characters got too much screen time and drew away from the overall storyline.The second half of the film does struggle a bit when they are based in the aquarium and definitely gets way too far fetched when it comes to Dory and an octopus driving a truck down the motorway! But despite this it really hits home with a heartfelt message when Dory finally finds her parents as they are bringing back shells. It's hard to hold back the tears in this moment, and again you animation has come so far that it came make humans cry at the story of fish - it would seem odd to be staring at a fish bowl and begin to cry and be overwhelmed at the fish family! They really personify and humanise the characters. The whole movie really tugs at that question deep within us all of where do we come from, of knowing your ancestry. It's no wonder that so many people travel all over the world to make the same links as Dory does.Overall its a great side story. It was never going to be as great as the original, but it is definitely well made and adds rather than takes away from the whole story.",7,1,2,3 June 2020
Black Panther," Wow! This movie redeemed Marvel for me!
","Black Panther got me interested in Marvel movies again. Before Black Panther, I'd been completely put off Marvel movies for the fact that they were cookie cutter type of movies. The villain is always going to lose, the hero will always win, even to the point of falling of the cliff and have the hero handing on by one hand, no sacrifices ever really have to be made, its full of cheesy one liners and doesn't really break from method. It was the same recipe, repeat over and over.Until Black Panther, this felt completely new. It felt like anyone could be killed, no one was safe. The music was fresh and complimented the whole movie. The cast was awesome, they felt actually badass, like I would be intimidated if I came across Black Panther, compare this with other superheroes who seem so weak or lame.The costumes and technology used was exciting and kept me interested throughout. The cast was funny and well chosen. Right from Chadwick Boseman throughout to all cast members there were great strengths in acting. Letitia Wright was very funny, alongside Michael B. Jordan who was perfect baddie. Strong, ruthless and motivated for the right reasons.This movie was epic and so enjoyable from beginning to end. If you're over Marvel and their predictabilty then give this a go.",8,1,4,7 April 2020
Blade Runner," Enjoyable, but past its hay day now
","This movie was enjoyable enough. With older movies they either remain forever a classic whenever watched or sadly they can expire past their used by date and were only truly excellent to be enjoyed when they were first released. For me Blade Runner felt more like the latter. Not to say I didn't like it. But it's reputation went before it and my expectations were high. The change of fast 21st century pacing compared to 20th wasn't as much a shift for me to change to. For me it was more the main character and story just wasn't that interesting. Why had the AI come back? Where had they been previously? Although I must say the villain truly did embody the crazy antagonist. I feel like he alone made this film as well known as it had been. Popping his head through the bathroom wall was crack up.Although, I'm a bit confused on why the AI could bleed and not survive bullet wounds, in what way were they robots then? They seemed to be such close copies to humans that it was a bit too far. Looking forward to seeing the sequel though if the story can progress in more interesting ways. Great to see Harrison Ford not playing someone who has cheesy one liners too.",6,0,2,21 February 2020
Jojo Rabbit," A great laugh.
","Taika does it again!
My expectations were high after seeing some of Taika's previous movies, and I was not disappointed. Surprisingly emotional, actually. Jojo Rabbit is full of great acting, and subtle jokes for those who were watching closely, Jojo putting up a Hitler poster for instance and Taika's face changing as his hand moved over the image.Jojo and Elsa were awesome. Funny, and charismatic. Taika has had a good track work now working with young kids (Hunt for the Wilderpeople). Steven Merchant as always was crack up. Would've been good to see a bit more of him. The subtly of Jojo's mum's disapperance was also so well done, just as I started wondering where she'd been, BAM! Confronted with the reality of it all.Taika is so good at balancing humour and emotional rawness. He also provided a rare perspective in the child of Nazi Germany, one I hadn't considered. You can see his passion in this coming through for his heart towards Indigenous communities in NZ and the beauty of seeing life from another perspective or the humanness of us all. Great film!",8,5,9,17 February 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Marvel at their worst
","Watching the Marvel movies in chronological order has been quite interesting so far, but this movie is forgettable at best. I longed for it to finish so I could just get onto the next in the series.The romance between Thor and Jane is dull. Their reunion is almost a bit of a joke. What was even more frustrating though was the movie just assuming the audience wouldn't notice plot holes in the story or that we wouldn't care. It felt lazy in a few areas. The holes lining up over London of all places how convenient? And where have Shield been this whole time? The interns even mention this, as if this covers over the problem. Like putting a plaster on over a fatal wound. And I'm almost certain those planets Jane went to would not be sustainable planets for her even breathe air on and live! Plus she seems pretty chilled for the whole experience she has gone through. If I travelled through space and time to an epic kingdom like Asgard, I would be losing my mind! Jane is like 'meh', I don't buy it.The supporting characters for me I thought were below average. They felt like a weird mash up of The Hobbit and Star Wars characters. I think they had a chance to create some really memorable and important characters in Thor's story line. Instead we're just left with his lame friends and joke of a love interest that just bring the movie down.In saying that, it does have early hints of the success of Thor Ragnarok towards the end of the film where it starts to not take itself so seriously. Thor in the underground was a classic. Got to love the acting of Chris O'Dowd, little throwback to Bridesmaids seeing him again. And Loki was great to watch, he captures a lot of what I imagine Loki to actually be like. Just when you start to like him again and trust him, he rips it all away.In the end it was pretty predictable and cliched. These Marvel movies really start to head into that dangerous pattern of invincible heroes who always win, get the girl, and thwart the plans of the enemy. Totally cliched with Thor not knowing how to use the ship and randomly button mashing the controls as it magically turns on. This was just stupid for me. Even the mad scientist with no pants was a bit much. This recipe just killed the love of superhero movies for me over the next 3 of 4 years of Marvel movies. Only worth watching if you want to know a bit of the plot really.",5,0,1,18 February 2020
Apollo 13," Still worth a watch, 25 years later
","Apollo 13 was definitely worth the watch. It is such an outrageous story that it needs to be seen. The stories of human survival to its extreme always make for an interesting watch.Although it does drag a little in places where it feels like you just want them to get home already. But despite this, watching any movie with Tom Hanks in it most likely going to be good. In this case it is true, Tom Hanks again shows his masterclass. He just seems like such a nice guy, very trustworthy and a great leader in many of his characters. I'd be curious to see him play a character that is hated, or not loveable, seems like he's typecast himself into loveable characters.Not sure how accurate this movie really is, but it being 25 years old now, it hasn't aged too badly. Still worth a watch.",7,0,0,23 June 2020
The Great Gatsby," Much more interesting in the second half.
","This movie did some justice to the book I feel. Leonardo was a good fit for the character of Gatsby, as was everyone else who was casted. Perhaps Jordan felt different in my mind. Toby Maguire was a mixed bag really, Ih haven't taken him seriously in other movies, but his performance was ok.What really lets this movie down is the CGI and the music. Both stick out like sore thumbs and are hard to get by. The CGI was terrible, many of the backgrounds reminded me of the images you could use on Apple products in Iphoto. The whole movie had an odd translucent glaze over it and the quality of the CGI for 2013 was woeful. The music was also a huge let down. Why were they playing music from the 2000's? Rap and club songs in the 1920s? It looked and sounded more like a college fraternity house party, than what would've been a reality in 1920. It felt like giving machine guns to Ancient Greeks and expecting them to treat it normally. This did not fit, it was a missed opportunity to bring to life everything that a book can only do in imagination. The costume design was a better fit and did not distract as much.I disliked the first half of the movie strongly for those CGI and music reasons alone, which were especially obvious during the party scenes. The movie was much more interesting, as was the book I found, when it came to the big conflict in what was Daisy going to do, and the fall out of the events that followed.This was done much better and my opinion and saved the movie from being a complete fail.Overall a missed opportunity on what could've been a great film.",6,1,1,15 March 2020
The Godfather," Pretty good, not the best of all time!
","The Godfather! Known as the best movie of all time. That's about as high as the bar can be set, I think something like this will always disappoint when the bar is that high. Was it a great movie? Yes. Was it the best movie I've ever seen? No. Thankfully it reminded me that movies cannot actually provide as any sense of true purpose, real meaning, or long lasting satisfaction. They're an escape. This movie helped me to remember that movies alone cannot show me who I really am. It can educate and show new perspectives, and show part of who we are, or we can feel happy for a while, but this never lasts. If the best movie ever made couldn't do it then surely no movie can. I'd held out so long for watching this movie, always seeing it at the top of IMDB lists and imagining how good it must be, when it easily beats some of my all time favourites. But at the end of the day its just another movie. Worth watching. Not worth putting all your hope into of being the pincale of movie making. Great acting, great story though. It felt so authentic, very fresh and unlike movies that are made today. Sad that many western cultures today do not have such a strong sense of family and tradition - although in saying that this family and its traditions are not something I would want any part to do with.",8,0,1,23 February 2020
