Alien 3," Insulting to the Alien series
","There are few spoilers ahead, but trust me, it won't make this film any less enjoying, because it couldn't go any lower. I can just say right now that the first two 'Alien' films are at the top of GOOD sci-fi movies. They also had two talented directors(Ridley Scott and Jim Cameron) leading them. However, Alien 3 has nothing special about it. I can say right now that Sigourney Weaver is the ONLY good thing this film has.The story and the cinematography is what frustrated me the most. First off, the movie gives no explanation to how another Alien got into Ripley's ship. Strike one. Next, we find that the other three survivors from 'Aliens' die in their pods. Strike two AND three. This idiotic move was a team effort of a flashy film editor, the director, the writers, and the cheapskate producers who couldn't afford to have Michael Biehn in the film. Alien 3 is shot using orange/yellow light to make the corridors feel dark and foreboding. Wrong. It simply sickened me because all David Fincher was trying to do was mimic Cameron's clever use of blue-green light in 'Aliens'. One part in the movie was just so ignorant that it almost made me laugh out loud, until I realized the writers were actually serious. For the first 1/2 hour of Alien 3 a male lead role is built up rather well, and then all of the sudden, he is killed. Right then I knew that this film really blew it. Finally, I should comment on the actual Alien. I can understand that in the first 3 films all the aliens(except the queen) are only briefly shown because of lack of technological advances. In Alien 3 the beast is poorly superimposed onto the film, much like those dogs in Ghostbusters. I still prefer the body-suit aliens, cause at least then they wouldn't look so fake. That's all I have to say about that. 1-10 Overall-- 5 Direction--6 Photography--2 Acting--7 Music score--7 Visuals--6",3,503,549,16 July 2001
Akira," Overrated and nonsensical
","I don't care if I anger every so-called 'otaku' out there that loves this movie, but I must say that Akira is certainly NOT the best anime out there. Akira does have its qualities, such as the intense motorcycle chases throughout the movie, and as with all anime, the superb attention to detail is not lacking a bit.       However, Akira suffers from a severely disjointed story. I know that almost all animes have plots that are confusing, but Akira tops almost all of them. I could understand the whole government testing idea, but the plot present at the last half of the movie about psychic powers and stuff lost me. The movie holds up very well until the testing begins, and the climax is disgustingly absurd. The writers offer little to no explanation of half the events in this movie, and I feel that this is what killed the film, along with the badly-drawn Dragonball Z-type characters. If you want to see good anime see anything by Hayao Miyazaki. 1-10  Overall--5.5 Direction--6 Story--2.5 Visuals--8.5",5,8,17,29 October 2001
Snatch," Hard-edged British comedy
","Snatch is a stylish crime/comedy that excels in its crafty writing and spot-on direction from Guy Ritchie. Also, the performers are perfect for each of their roles and there's not a single bad actor in the bunch. Standouts include Brad Pitt as a speed-talking Irish gypsy, Alan Ford as the wicked Brick Top, and Vinnie Jones as Bullet Tooth Tony. Guy Ritchie improves greatly over his last movie, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which had several actors that appear in Snatch as well(look hard!). The only problem with the movie is that the fast pace of the story and the sometimes-hard-to-follow dialects will throw off people who just want simple laughs. Definitely worth a rental.  1-10  Overall--7.5 Direction--7 Writing--8.5 Acting--7.5 Music--7",7,0,1,17 December 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Epic Filmaking at its Best
","The Two Towers should not be considered as a sequel to the Fellowship of the Ring. It is the three-hour second act, with the upcoming Return of the King being the three-hour third act. That said, knowing what happened in the first film is necessary to understanding almost everything in the second film.      I have read the Lord of the Rings books, and I was not disappointed that certain things were cut out of the first film. However, I was a little upset with a few of the changes that Jackson made in The Two Towers, notably the exclusion of the giant spider Shelob, which will apparently make it into Return of the King. Also, the order in which things happened in the books are not all similar to how they happen in the movie, and the back-and-forth editing hurt the flow of the film and consequently made things feel awkward. As a movie alone, however, The Two Towers is nothing but fantastic. Jackson's direction is quite skillful, especially at the much-revered Helm's Deep scene, which features the greatest 'silence before the violence' moment EVER. The visuals certainly have outdone the first film in almost every way, mostly thanks to the CGI creature Gollum, who looks so very real. The acting was on par with Fellowship, but it could have been better if Gandalf and Saruman had bigger roles and more lines.      A few things I was let down by were the sets and locations, which seemed a lot less inspired than in the first film; the writing, which strayed a bit TOO far from the books; and the musical score, which wasn't bad, but wasn't as great as the Fellowship score. The only other thing that bothered me was the lighting. I had hoped the Two Towers would have been darker, but much of it took place in the daytime. Even so, these small flaws could in no way bring down such a marvelous epic as this. Definitely worth price of admission.1-10 Scale   Overall-9 Direction-8.5 Writing-7 Acting-8 Score-8 Cinematography-8.5 Visuals-9.5",10,0,0,30 December 2002
Heat," Well-Crafted Crime Movie
","Oh yes, the trailers all trumpeted the great coming-together of De Niro and Pacino in this movie, and to a lesser extent, Val Kilmer. True, Heat does boast above-average acting and character development, but that is not all the audience should pay attention to here.What's even better than the acting in this movie is the stark reality of crime in LA, although the infamous bank shoot-out may have went a little off the edge. Michael Mann seems totally comfortable letting the camera rest on someone or something for longer than most other modern directors can tolerate, because he knows that this not just a popcorn action movie.
The actual story is not the most original, but it is wholly enjoyable, especially when so many good performers on screen to deliver their lines. For the record, I liked Pacino more than De Niro here, and Pacino's unhappy wife also acted well. As for the rest of the cast members, any average moviegoer can probably recognize each and every one of them.Although the film needlessly drags on to around 3 hours in length, one ends up appreciating the time spent watching a crime movie of this scale and quality. It's quite a suprise that Heat didn't sizzle at the Oscars. 1-10 Scale  Overall-8  Direction-8.5  Acting-9  Story-6  Music Score-6 Cinematography-8",9,0,2,10 July 2002
The Thin Red Line," Profound yet confusing
","For those who compare this to Saving Private Ryan, I will tell you that although they are both WWII movies, they have little in common. Saving Private Ryan was a gritty, gory, intense action war movie. The Thin Red Line is more like Apocalypse Now, as it is more psychological than violent, with a more beautiful backdrop to it than Ryan. Terence Malick does a fine job directing a strong cast of men through their personal conflicts. James Caviezel is wonderful as a subtle, peaceful man dragged into a useless conflict. Nick Nolte is also superb as the typical disgruntled colonel who wants all the Japs dead. The stunning cinematography is a sharp contrast to the brutal battle scenes that occur throughout the film, and Hans Zimmer again proves he is the king of war movie composers. With all this praise, the Thin Red Line should not go bad. But it sours a little. Malick drags the film out heavily with voice-over narration that could've made more sense, especially after the raid on the Japanese camp. The film picks itself back up for the denouement, and I was overall very impressed by this thinking man's war movie. 1-10  Overall--7.5 Direction--7.5 Photography--8.5 Acting--8 Story--5 Music score--8",10,0,0,25 October 2001
