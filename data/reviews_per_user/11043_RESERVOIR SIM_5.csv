The Sound of Music," sorry, didn't do anything for me
","This film is one of those films I grew up watching at home, school etc.  I have never enjoyed this film.  I've tried to but I just don't. My whole family like it except me. I can't even stand to be in the same room when the video is on.  The reason I don't like this film is that the kids kinda annoy me in it and its too nice to be real, even though I think it's based on a true story. I can understand why people like this film, I have nothing against those people.",1,11,43,30 January 2000
12 Monkeys," Spine-tingling stuff
","This movie was so engrossing. The fact that you never know what is going on. I watched this movie at New Year - 1997 I was meant to be watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show, but when I was waiting for the film to start, I got bored with the documentary that was on so I flipped through the channels and started to watch Twelve Monkeys because I heard Bruce Willis was in it.  I became so interested in the movie that I forgot all about the Rocky Horror Show.  The great thing about the film is that you don't know if Cole (Willis) is imagining things or if he is telling the truth.  But it is Brad Pitt who steals most of the scenes as the asylum inmate. I love the twist at the end.  After I watched the film I kept thinking about it so I rented it. The second time I watched it, it seemed to make more sense. It's one of those films that you seem to notice different things each time you watch it.6 great things about this film:1  Bruce Willis was in it. 2  All round good cast. 3  I like time-traveling films. 4  The twist at the end. 5  Psychological thriller. 6  The theme.",10,0,0,21 August 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," good but could be better
","as a fan of the t.v show I was really excited about this movie I went to see it. I loved it so much I went 9 more times.  But I thought we were robbed because on the front cover it says 'uncut' but I didn't see what was so uncut about it. Certain characters should have had a bigger part in it ie Officer Barbrady, Chef, Ned and Jimbo, the Mayor and some characters should not have had such a large part in it; the parents, Big Gay Al for example. But apart from that I love it.",10,0,0,27 November 1999
Psycho," Best black and white horror ever
","I watched this movie  because it was Hitchcocks anniversary and it was one of those films I'd been dying to see and I thought it was great {I didn't think it was as good as a lot of people had told me though}. The twist about mother was cool, second  best in history next to the Sixth Sense. I thought 2 and 3 were cool too.  Anthony Perkins  was really good as Norman Bates.",9,11,19,24 November 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," The hat. The glove. The jumper. The scars
","In my opinion Freddy is the most evil and most famous movie villain. This is a  classic for any horror fan. The idea is great, a man goes into people's dreams and kills them with a customized glove/claw.  Freddy might scare the life out of me but he has also made me laugh - when he chops his fingers off with his glove and when he's attacking the girl and she pulls off his face to reveal a laughing skull.  I hate it when people talk about this movie and say it's just some old 80's horror film from the writer of Scream. Those people should give the film the respect it deserves.  What is the first thing that comes into your mind when you hear the name Wes Craven?",Null,0,0,13 January 2000
