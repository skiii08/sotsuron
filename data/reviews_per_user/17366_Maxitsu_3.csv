Kill Bill: Vol. 2," perfect example of a extremely overrated movie
","When i saw vol. 1 i was not really a fan, but the movie was watchable. so i wanted to see how the story ends. But vol. 2 was one big disappointment and there are more goofs then in any other movie. the bride can hold a sword in the air whit Pai Mei standing on the sword. When people damages there hands, get cut by a knife or sword, get shot in the chest. they all are healed in the next scene or shot. still i don't understand how you can escape out a coffin if you are buried a few meters underground. its impossible to swim to the surface in dirt. The 5th movie of Quentin Tarantino is a disaster. i give this movie 1 point out of 10.",1,4,14,7 January 2006
Armageddon," My favorite movie
","My all-time favorite movie. An All-Star cast: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan and Peter Stormare. A great soundtrack, a fast (not over-rushed) paced storyline, good action, adventure, romance, science-fiction, drama, nice visual effect whit humor better then any other comedy. What do you need more? don't know why its so under-rated!?Whit this movie, Michael Bay became one of my favorite directors/producers. Popcorn movies at its best. when hes making a movie its not hard to understand, its never annoying, great visuals, and always a great finishing touch -> Humor.",10,0,1,13 July 2008
Alien vs. Predator," I really like this one
","i have seen the Alien-movies and the predator-movies. i was immediately a big fan of this movies, when i heard they where making a movie whit aliens and predators together i was very surprised. But Alien VS predator has a bad story/plot. also the actors did a poor job. But then again, The Predators are very cool, specially whit there new weapons and new technologies. also the fights against the aliens are great(they had to put more AVP-fights into the movie). Also the special effects are great. the entertaining value is very high. specially because the movie moves on a very fast pace (maybe a bit to fast). for much people this is a bad movie because a bad story, bad actor, etc.., for me its a very entertaining movie. i really enjoyed this movie and i hope there will be a AVP-II very soon.",8,4,7,13 November 2005
