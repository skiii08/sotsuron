The Finest Hours," An Outstanding Film Combining Action with Human Drama
","If you are looking for a contemporary action movie with car chases, gun fights, and super heroes; this is not the film for you. Instead, it takes on the challenging task of capturing real-life people who do extraordinary tasks because they come with their job. Reality is always more powerful than fiction when it is captured with care, but we are not used to seeing this and unfortunately this film has therefore not met all reviewer's expectations. In part, this is a sad commentary on our times.The Finest Hours is about real people whose strength and courage come through but with honesty and subtlety. The film has a powerful love interest, but is nevertheless primarily about men ... unlikely heroes who rise to unimaginable challenges and subsequently return to worlds we can see in our neighbors. Visually it is a dramatic and technical masterpiece. Its original score is powerful but works with the unfolding events. There are no (as yet) big-name stars, but instead an ensemble cast that captures real lives and normal people. In short, it is a courageous movie about real people who despite their strengths and limitations do what must be done and emerge wiser and stronger for their accomplishment.",10,4,14,29 January 2016
