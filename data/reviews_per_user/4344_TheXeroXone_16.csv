The Avengers," The Earth's Mightiest Buddy Cop Film.
","I can't help but be a little reminded of Sergio Aragones' take on Marvel Comics where all the marvel characters had gotten together to face off against the Seagoing Soarer, only to be reminded that whenever Marvel comic characters assemble in large numbers they must always fight amongst themselves, regardless of the reason or the consequences.Its the same with most buddy cop movies. Such introductory films require a little adversarial tension in order for headstrong individualistic alphas to come together and overcome the foe that is bigger than either could handle alone. Lethal Weapon. 48 Hours. Tango and Cash. The Last Boyscout. Red Heat. Etcetera. Etcetera.This is the same basic formula that the Avengers follows. Its a buddy cop film with more explosions and the Hulk. The animosity here, however, tends to come from the machinations of Loki, and the general distrust of working with a secret organization, albeit one with our best interests in mind.The characters are not two dimensional caricatures. Each with their own emotional weaknesses and psychological strengths. The development is meager, but adequate for an action film. One moment of blatant Chekov's Gun exists where a character's devotion is called into question and then takes on a 'suicide' mission at the end of the final battle. I'm not quite willing to call it lazy writing at this point, but it is painfully reminiscent of the 'you're a valued part of the team, too' episodes that every 80's cartoon series had. Multiple viewings may be needed to come to a final verdict on that minor and relatively unneeded subplot.The only other minor gripe I had with the film is that there was very few scenes where the heroes worked together in a fight. A couple more well choreographed fight scenes involving multiple heroes would have been welcome, but its nothing more than a minor inconvenience.The Earth's Mightiest Buddy Cop Film.",8,1,4,22 May 2012
Skyfall," Serviceable, but Flimsy Bond Film
","Not much to say about this film's plot. All the scenes are appropriately emotional and the actors are all good at their respective roles, but the plot is just a standard revenge plot. The villain has the same basic storyline as the villain from GoldenEye. He's an ex-British spy out for revenge and Javier Bardem plays him like Heath Ledger's Joker, complete with a disfigured face and a complete nonchalance towards explosives.And the third act of this film was just spinning its wheels in reheated gibberish. The bad guy comes in referencing Apocalypse Now and the heroes counter with Home Alone.. Really? And even though MI6 knows exactly where Bond is running to, they can't send reinforcements, why? It all leads up to a fan service epilogue. Its not bad, per se... but its really just so paint-by-numbers at this point.I'm not going to say Daniel Craig isn't a perfectly good James Bond. He's a great Bond, but so far, his villains are really weak. I want the genocidal mad-men and sinister organizations back. What we have now just feels like a series of briefly enjoyable, but ultimately empty one-night stands.",7,2,10,12 November 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Interesting Nazi Exploitation
","The plot of the film is basically summed up by its premise. A bunch of Jews go and kill a bunch of Nazis set to Tarantino's unique style. There is lots of action, a little sex, decent conversation and interaction, interesting choices for music... and in this case.. history is thrown right out the window for the sake of telling a more interesting story.Unfortunately there were some noticeable flaws in the film that make it less memorable than other Tarantno films. For one, the characters aren't nearly as memorable, nor are they near as quotable. Second, the typography seemed a little disjointed and could have been planned a little better. Third, and only in one scene, the music was a little off for the scene. The lyrics made sense, but something about the music was not nearly as appropriate and it lacked a certain cohesion that we have come to expect from Quentin Tarantino.Ultimately this film appears to be yet another attempt by Tarantino to recapture and make mainstream the grindhouse epic and I must admit that a true return to this kind of cinema with modern resources appeals to me and despite the aforementioned flaws, this film is really enjoyable.8/10",8,1,6,4 September 2009
The Hunger Games," Stop Shaking the Damn Camera
","Who'd have ever thought that the USA would have to import its violence. But its true. In the quest to ever lower the bar for how far Hollywood will go to grab a buck, they finally made a movie about children slaughtering each other with a PG-13 rating.How did they accomplish this? By shaking the camera mercilessly and never showing any actual penetration. In effect, its about as violent as any three stooges movie without the zany sound effects. Dogs mauling kids; either off-screen or in the shadows. Killer wasps; more shaky camera work and muddied CGI. If it wasn't for the cannon blasts signifying the deaths of the contestants, there would be no way to know what happened to most of the characters in the arena.I'm not saying this movie is stupid, its actually pretty good. Its just not a good action film and its almost too juvenile for what should be a more dramatic piece. The violence is all done off-screen or through the use of shaky cameras so there's no sense of imminent danger. The other sacrifices are ignored so entirely that there's no feeling that the main character wouldn't make it to the end. There is a scene where a friend of the main character is impaled with a spear and there is no weight to the scene or the memorial scene that follows, its just another minor character dying off screen.This movie is more of a satire on reality TV game shows, but they don't do enough viewer reaction to important scenes (as they did in The Truman Show) to really monopolize on that satire. Only one scene attempts to capture that moment, but the gestures expressed between the character in the game and the audience are lost to those that haven't read the book. If you wish to find a better satire of reality TV game shows and socially acceptable violence, I recommend the movie Death Race 2000 with David Carradine and Sylvester Stallone.The best reason to see this movie is Woody Harrelson's character of a psychologically damaged and alcoholic winner from a previous tournament. He steals the show in every scene he's in.Its good, but it could have been better.",7,1,4,21 April 2012
Cloverfield," This movie was such a waste of time
","I hope this isn't the new standard of movie genre. If it is, its worse than torture porn.. and I know they're working on a hand-held zombie film using this same technique. *shudder* The reality is in order for movies like this to work, the characters have to be borderline, intellectually retarded in order to validate why they would even consider getting close enough to the monsters, or whatever enemy, to make for a good film. This makes the hand-held film maker's inevitable and formulaic demise so much more anticlimactic because anyone with any common sense would not be running in the direction of a giant unknown creature dropping monster lice all over the city. This tends to ruin any sense of empathy for the character.The guy shooting the majority of the film is, of course, a grand idiot. This is established very early on and it is the only character development in the entire film. His death is arguably the worst part of the movie because the guy has been saying the stupidest things throughout the entire movie, but right when his demise is looking him square in the face (for *far* too long, mind you), he picks this time to shut up. It was a waste of an already ridiculous set-up.The only really good thing about this movie is that they thought about why don't the survivors just wait for the creature to pass by. The answer they came up with is man-sized, monster lice that drop off the creature and attack people. However, that doesn't stop them from making these things ridiculous because these things will make you blow up if you're bitten once. Apparently an army of aggressive, man-sized bugs with giant mandibles just isn't enough of a threat.Its fairly obvious the people who made this film only wanted to use the technique to make a giant monster film and actually show the monster this time, instead of merely hinting at it like the Blair Witch Project did. The result is shoddy, predictable and obviously not well thought out.Final Grade: D+",4,97,151,28 January 2008
Fargo," This is, without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever seen.
",Who in their right minds could ever consider this to be a decent film? How the hell did Frances McDormand win an Oscar for this movie and how bad were the other nominees in comparison? How the hell did they advertise this junk? Frances McDormand takes on Peter Falk's role of Lt. Columbo as she tracks down yet another one of the Coen brothers' intellectually-handicapped kidnappers. Experience the oohs and ahhs as you hear Northern Minnesotan accents that were done better on Howie Mandel's kiddie show 'Bobby's World'. Can even the combined forces of William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi can save this film from certain mediocrity? I don't think so.Calling this movie a classic is the equivalent of calling a chunk of cow flesh (with skin and hairs intact) plopped between two mounds of uncooked bread dough a classic hamburger.,1,8,20,9 July 2008
Spider-Man," Finally..
","Marvel is starting to make some decent movies. Blade and Blade 2 were both good and Spider-Man is.. well.. amazing. I was a little skeptical when I heard Sam Raimi was directing it, but I was wrong. This is a great film.
Mind you, its not going to please the purists. I heard a couple of them as I walked out of the theater whining about how it didnt follow the plotline of the comic or 'Where was Gwen Stacy?' Personally, I don't give a rat's @$$ about Gwen Stacy or how they changed the storyline from the comics. You can't please purists, so why bother trying. This is definitely a movie for the true-believers. Sam Raimi should be proud of this achievement as should Stan Lee. I only hope that they learn from the mistakes of the Batman series and keep it one villain per movie and that they dont use the Green Goblin again until Spider-Man 3. If they are done right (and given proper funding), Spider-Man could easily last for 6-7 movies.My only complaint about the movie is that I wish Stan Lee had a better cameo.",8,0,0,5 May 2002
The Amazing Spider-Man," At least there's no whiny Parker anymore
","I resisted seeing this film for the longest time for two reasons. One, I refuse to encourage or financially validate the remaking trend in Hollywood. Two, the trailer made it look like a Twilight rip-off. But, after being told by two different theaters in one night that the late night showings for Man with the Iron Fist had been canceled, I finally decided to shell out a buck twenty at a redbox for a rental. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. It was basically a fan service film dedicated to everything that wasn't present in the first three films. First the good changes - Peter Parker is no longer a chronic whiner and as Spider-Man, he is a jokester which adds all the lightheartedness this film needs. Denis Leary nails his performance as Captain Stacy.The rest of the changes was mediocre to flatulent. The worst being the automatic vaccine dispensing computer that took less than 8 minutes to make a completely untested vaccine for a biological compound that specifically targets lizard-based (not spider-based... that's important) genetic mutations. Granted, in any science fiction film you have to make machines do magical things. I mean that's why they call it Science Fiction. There's just so much that's unnecessarily silly and it really depends on your personal ability to suspend disbelief. So go see it and make the choice for yourself.",6,1,2,13 November 2012
Saw III," Why Saw III failed to satisfy...
","In the first two Saw films there was something there that made the movie not just about the gore or the brutality that put it head and shoulders above all the other slasher films, there was intelligence and hope. The victims of Jigsaw were almost always given a modicum of hope that they could survive what they were given and come out breathing if they acted intelligently enough. Furthermore, the ending of each film was always brutal and yet hopeful at the same time. In the first Saw unanswered questions concerning Dr Gordon and Adam gave us hope. In the second Saw, the outcomes of the lives of Daniel, Detective Matthews, Amanda and Kerry may have been brutalized (emotionally or physically), but there was still hope.Saw III was not a depiction of a lack of hope, but rather a thorough extraction of it. None of the victims in Saw III had hope or the ability to get themselves out of the traps they were in except through the actions of others. It became more about the traps than it became about the lessons these individuals had to learn. And in the end all that's left is gore, misery and an innocent life taken needlessly.The plot of Saw III was Machiavellian in its design to be sure, but ultimately it proceeded through the movie like a sledgehammer instead of a jigsaw.",3,64,104,29 October 2006
Enchanted," Ultimately a victim of bad editing.
","I find this movie is hard to critique because there was a lot that was really good about this film with just a few moments of clumsy story editing involved. As a romantic comedy this film delightfully shines above most, but only because Amy Adams overplays every scene with a stunning display of storybook innocence. The film's use of the typical princess superpower of command over animals in the real world is extremely funny - watching anthropomorphic cockroaches cleaning an apartment is always good for a sight gag (as proved in Joe's Apartment). The instant song/dance routine generation is just a little too over the top, but is still enjoyable. There is also some things that are very bland about this movie. When the central idea of the film is to challenge romantic stereotypes and the filmmakers limit those stereotypes to just those within animated romances, the stereotypes and clichés that are used in live action romances stick out like a sore thumb. For example, the character of Robert Philip is shown to be faithfully attached to a woman for five years and even though there is no sign of emotional problems within the relationship, that connection is shown that it can be torn asunder by the introduction of a single female. Also, this movie fails to give the character of Prince Edward any time to really develop interest or explanations for why he does half the things he does. For example, why does he jump head first into a well when he has absolutely no idea what's down there or why does he jump on a bus and believe it to be a wild beast when they obviously have carriages in the animated world?Susan Surandon's character of the evil stepmother offers the movie little beyond her animated portrayal. When she shows up in the end, all she comes across as is a drug dealer and someone whose purpose is to spell out the role-reversals to anyone in the audience who just happened to be stricken with blindness within the previous 10 minutes. The unfortunate fact that her character does not come to terms with the limitations of her clichéd persona as the other characters do leaves a bit of a void within the story. Of course I couldn't possibly write a review about this movie without mentioning Nathaniel and the animated chipmunk, Pip. There, I mentioned them. Final Grade: C+ (nothing to cry about)",7,1,3,16 March 2008
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not Terrible, but nowhere near spectacular
","Bryan Singer's X2 may have raised the bar a little too high to reach again, but even so, I definitely expected more than what Brett Ratner had to offer.The movies starts out well enough in the first 10 minutes but when the plot starts to move, it stumbles clumsily for the next hour and then finally limps across the finish line with a whimper instead of a bang. None of the major plot points in this film are explored or used to its fullest potential, with the possible exception of Hank McCoy aka Beast and you wind up feeling just a little emptier than when you began. The deaths of two main characters are underwhelming, much of the discourse of the remaining characters is forced, Angel's involvement is meek and predictable, the social implications of using the cure as a weapon are brushed up against only lightly, and the problems that Magneto creates are eliminated with the dramatic intensity of flipping a light switch.There are some decent scenes in the film that helped make up for a lack of great scenes and other scenes were not as good in the eyes of the comic fans, but were understandably reduced for a mainstream audience. For example, the cosmic origins of the Phoenix and the Juggernaut were re-written from the comics to help ease their translation into the film. Rogue's re-write from the first film also played a part in the decisions the character ultimately, and unsurprisingly, made in the film. Unfortunately the emotional and social impacts of her decision were yet more additions to the list of items that were never really explored.As a stand alone movie, the film doesn't do much better than a standard 90's action flick with lots of special effects and a very basic level of drama. Its not terrible, but its not nearly as spectacular as it could or should have been for a final chapter.",6,0,2,27 May 2006
Hellboy," I liked this film.
","Granted, I could see how some scenes of this movie could be considered derivative (Alien, Deep Rising). Know what? Dont care. Lots of weirdness in this film. It has no real mythology to latch onto. Thats ok though, Hellboy makes its own, and it does a decent job. Hellboy is a good movie because while every character has his strengths, both physically and emotionally, they also have their weaknesses, both physically and emotionally. The characters are not driven by a single visual or biochemical motif, which I believe to be a plus for the movie. It shows that such a group does not simply evolve through normal circumstance and that each character is a true rarity and thus a system based on such rarity cannot function as normal teams would. Each player comes from an entirely different background; they each do their job and do it well enough that the group, regardless of personal shortcomings, are able to succeed more often than not.In the end, this movie is decent. The only problem that I had with it is the initial release of the monsters upon the city. Maybe I missed the reason, but I saw no real effect towards the ultimate goals of the main antagonists. I will have to wait until the DVD comes out so I can buy it and watch it again.Overall Rating: Solid 8",8,0,0,3 April 2004
Clash of the Titans," CLASH!! Ahh-Aaah! Savior of the Universe!!
","First of all, you have to acknowledge that the original Clash of the Titans was a weak storyline that focused more on special effects than plot line and this one, essentially, is no worse.The storyline is different than the original in that here the gods are the antagonists of all humans and humans stand upon brink of abandoning the apathetic gods who need human worship to survive. There is also a subplot that pits the gods against themselves, which is kind of cliché, but as I said, this film is more about the visuals.The majority of the main characters of the original are also in this film. The guards who follow Perseus on his quest are developed better and thus their respective demises are felt more. Calibos and Medusa are humanized more than their original counterparts and become more than mere antagonists, but extreme versions of the godly interventions upon man that Perseus is fighting to put an end to. The Kraken is a great menace, but somehow lacks the visual personality of the original Harryhausen masterpiece. However, the Stygian witches are wonderfully grotesque and Charon looks more impressive than the standard Grim Reaper.The playwright is woefully missing, but instead replaced with Io who guides Perseus with knowledge and wisdom. Also, instead of Bobo the Owl (who makes an obligatory cameo) we get a half-Ent with blue flames for eyes who rides around on giant scorpions and offers abilities above and beyond the average action figure.Perseus is also more developed in this film, however I can't say I like his new look. No longer is Perseus a Mediterranean pretty boy, but looks more like a mid-western jarhead. His motivations also mirror Batman's motivations a little too much (His parents are killed in front of him and he has an aversion to using divine weapons like the ones that killed his parents).All in all, this film is a lot of fun. There is a lot that is cheesy and over the top, but its a quality entertainment piece. I recommend it to all fans of the original.8.5 out of 10",8,3,8,2 April 2010
Avatar," High quality, Low originality
","This movie is the best it can be for being what it is. The film is extremely formulaic, taking from Dances with Wolves as well as Starship Troopers. However, regardless of how trite the plot is, the film remains nothing but absolute enjoyment from beginning to end. The scenery is gorgeous, the aliens lack in character building from a lack of dialogue but are still fun to watch, and the CGI blends seamlessly with the live action. This film is like going to a restaurant and getting a Five Star Spamburger. Yes its still Spam no matter how you slice it, but it'll be the best Spam you've ever had. So sit back and enjoy the taste.",8,0,3,27 December 2009
Thor," A couple of bad casting decisions aside, not bad.
","Thor is an interesting film, but I'm not sure whether to say its worth seeing or not. There is a lot that is good about this film and a lot that sank to the bottom of the barrel. The special effects are decent for the most part except that the Frost Giants' facial make-up looks like ass and the multiple Loki illusion scene looks like it was thrown together with a bad video editor at the last minute.The plot revolves around Thor being banished to Earth in order to teach him humility and self-control in the face of conflict. The best parts of the film are those that derive themselves from the whole 'alien in a strange land' motif that lends itself from '3rd Rock from the Sun' and 'Mork and Mindy'. Unfortunately the film lacks any kind of serious introspection that the aforementioned series each had that would bring about this kind of change that Thor needed. Instead we get emotional conflict and bonding that varies consistently between totally forced and half-assed.The most solid performance in this film is the role of Heimdall, played by Idris Elba, because he's the only Asgardian who isn't treated like a happy-go-lucky dork. Volstagg is the only one who should really stand out as a happy-go-lucky dork because that's who he is. Loki wasn't bad either, but it was difficult to follow his emotional turmoil as his goals and manipulations change throughout the film.Worst performance easily goes to Natalie Portman, who has absolutely NO chemistry with Chris Hemsworth and whose character does just mind-bogglingly stupid things throughout the film (think Lois Lane without the journalistic integrity). Another odd choice was Anthony Hopkins as Odin. Not that he didn't do his job relatively well, but only a few times, while watching Odin on screen, did I think to myself that I was watching a character other than Anthony Hopkins (in truth, his staff commanded more presence on screen).Overall Grade: C+",6,0,2,22 May 2011
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A step above the first one
","That's not saying much mind you. In the original movie the transformers were treated like punching bags and punchlines. No real interaction with the story or other characters at all. This movie, in that respect, is slightly better, but while, in a few scenes, where the transformers are treated like actual characters, this movie also does some really dumb things.The most glaring example of this added stupidity are the 4chan brothers; twin Autobots that do nothing but talk smack throughout the entire movie. The one scene where they aren't talking smack is so ridiculous, that its not even worth mentioning.A couple of less impressive moments include a paper-thin Decepticon that somehow manages to hold onto and hide a large chunk of the cube from the first movie, a female Decepticon that transforms into a human female with a three foot prehensile tongue (the tip of which remains as a tongue even when she is in robot form, because the audience is not expected to know what the long appendage reaching from her mouth is referring to), and a tiny Decepticon whose most treacherous act is to hump Megan Fox's leg for far too long. Bumblebee's stupidity was seen in the trailer so it should come as no surprise when he starts bawling like a 3 year old that doesn't get its way.Also the plot includes finding this key which five Autobot 'Primes' died to protect by merely burying it in a pile of rocks and turning their bodies into the shrine which housed it. This 'sacrifice' makes absolutely no sense except that Michael Bay needed, for the sake of the final fight, all the other Primes to die so that only Optimus Prime would be left to kill off the Fallen, which only a Prime can kill - its never explained why nothing else can kill this robot. Maybe its like the 4th directive from Robocop, I don't know. This is not a movie you can put a lot of thought into.There are a couple of good things in this film. Soundwave makes regular appearances as a communications satellite and is never found out during the length of the film - which is surprisingly good writing. Also, Shia Lebouf is far less irritating in this film than he was in the first one, which is a major plus.All in all, not bad. I was honestly expecting it to be much worse.",5,17,37,14 September 2009
