Scarface," Scar face review
","I like the movie scar face because it is an American reality still taking place in the United States today. Drug trafficking in America I nothing new to this country along with gun smuggling it is one of the largest profiting illegal business being operated in America today. The movie Scar face exploits this realistic view of how a Cuban refugee sought a better life in America and eventually lived what he believed to be the American dream only to die of greed, corruption, and abuse of power. Though he might have not used my suggested idea for his way to obtain his so called rise to power and American dream but where I am from that is a reality to the road that some take to provide and survive in their surroundings. This movie is a mere reality in some ways of living for some individuals who chose that particular lifestyle which eventually ends just as Scar face did..dead in the end.",10,0,1,3 November 2006
