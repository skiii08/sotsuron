The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Such a Masterpice
","Disclaimer: Personal Opinions Ahead.This movie made me fell in love with the idea of being a wallflower.
Firstly, the soundtrack is beatifull it matches the era of the movie. Also, it has a lot of famous songs from Great Artist.
Secondly, the acting in this movie is amazing. I mean what do you expect from a movie with actors like Emma Watson, Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller, Paul Rudd and many more.
Last but not least, the script is well written. It is not a secret that it made me identify with Charlie (Logan Lerman's role).Thank you,
SBPs. If you haven't watched this movie yet. I suggest watching it now.",10,1,2,6 June 2019
The Shining," This movie is NOT one of the best movies if all time
","It is a great 80's movie, but for today's standards its not well made. Even though the acting performance Of Jack Nicholsson is amazing in Shelley Duvall's counterpart in some instances its laughable. Last but not least, some scenes gave me the feeling of seeing a comedy and not a thriller.Thank you,SB",6,7,17,7 June 2019
