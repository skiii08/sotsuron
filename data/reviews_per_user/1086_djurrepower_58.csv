Ford v Ferrari," great
",I cant help but have a soft spot fore these kind of movies. post war engineering is just something incredible. its very much like 'First Man' but the cinematography is a little less sublime. this movie makes up for that with some better writing.8/10: great,8,1,1,5 January 2020
Moneyball," underdog
","Its a good underdog story but there isnt much great about this moive. so its kept simple. not much to say thb, nothing really happened that made me think, impressed or look surprised.6/10: fine",6,0,0,4 February 2020
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," 50/50
","Some moments felt genuine but most of the time it felt the people were in on the joke. this was sometimes the case and sometimes not, but this made me question the ones that were real. so sometimes it was just kinda cringe.5/10: eh",5,0,2,6 May 2020
Captain Phillips," eh
","Well made and performed. i cant help but get a little annoyed when it just becomes navy propaganda. its the only way to got borrow those ships, but cmon. apart from that, its a little too much action it feels like. almost no downtime.6/10: good but not subtle",6,0,3,26 January 2020
Sucker Punch," the big bad
",Dont get me wrong its a bad movie. but a good laugh for how ridiculous it gets. its funny even if its not trying to be. the over the top dramatic and the absurdity of it all just makes it a dumb movie in a fun way.4/10: movie for turning your brain off,4,3,8,22 December 2019
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," one of the best kids movies
","If you are watching as an adult, you wont really get much out of it apart from nostalgia. but that doesnt mean that its a great movie. this has basicly all the ingredients that a good kids movie must have. mistery, awe, imagination and lightheartness.7/10: joy",7,2,3,11 January 2020
The Big Lebowski," just ok
","A simple story for the nihilistic mentality. didnt laugh all that much but it has its moments. but i would call it a unique enough movie to give its praise.6/10: nice and simple, like the movie wants to be",6,2,3,20 December 2019
Inglourious Basterds," comedy??
","I dont know, some attempts were made to make you laugh but i dint feel it. the funky action was amuzing but not much else. its a well made movie and you dont feel like you are wasting your time, but at the end of the movie i didnt feel like i enjoyed my time either.5/10: not much to say about",5,0,2,27 December 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," good
","First, davy jones is a treat. i just smile whenever he gets on screen. aside from that, this is mostly just a setup movie. has some nice moments but falls flat when it comes as a standalone movie. is has all the quality of the 1st movie, but lacks the oomph.7/10: jones makes it a 7, 6 otherwise",7,0,0,22 June 2020
Argo," but nothing happens
","Its a movie build on suspence, but if you're not really affected by it, this movie is useless. in the beginning it even tries to be a comedy/drama and that does not work well in this case.5/10: useless",5,2,4,19 January 2020
Knives Out," cool
","I really like the who done it story when done right, in this movie did so pretty good. found the barf gimmic a little out of place, but i can turn a blind eye for that. i enjoyed the film, and find it a very good film.7/10: very good",7,1,3,7 February 2020
The Irishman," mafia movie in one of its best forms
","This goes right into the list of much see mafia movies. it can join the greats. its shines in character depth and the acting only further support that. even with the runtime of 3 hours, it feels like a complete coherent story that doesnt feel dragged out.8/10: honestly great",8,2,5,16 December 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," somewhat quirky but good nontheless
","It has many good moments, but it does get a little slow at times. but overall better than the 2nd movie but slightly worse than the 1st. if only it has more davy jones. nighy is just perfect in his role. and it did get tough to determine who is best girl. barbosa went absolutely bass to the ball in this movie, but davy just steals my heart every time, i just wish he has more great moments like in the 2nd movie, then this movie would be an 8. oh, and we dont talk about jack when it comes to best girl, no way. overrated7/10: it hold up",7,0,0,22 June 2020
Midnight in Paris," nice
",A little on the nose with some idea's. film feels quirky in a good way. owen wilson is a genius cast. it genuinely feels like a movie about a romantic by a romantic.7/10: best of its kind,7,0,0,4 February 2020
The Prestige," iffy
","I get the story and i get how cinema is a great way to showcase magic. but the whole tesla thing ruined it. the movie would have been so much better without him and its premise. but it was the only way the story/trick could work. so i would give it a 7, but the tesla thing brings it down.6/10: its pretty good, but has one big flaw",6,0,0,16 February 2020
Megamind," a little ahead of its time
","It has some childish stropes in it, but overall its not a childish movie. has some serious tones and good presentation. some good jokes some bad. but some ideas in this movie have found new attention in 2020, so i decided to rewatch it. and i got to say, it holds up pretty well.6/10: after 10 years still pretty fresh",6,0,0,29 May 2020
The Polar Express," oof
","Well it was nice to see this movie again after i saw it in the cinema. however the facetracing technology made the animations not age that well. not only that, but this is really tageted to kids, and most of the characters just made me sigh in dissapointment. but the soundtrack kept me fond.5/10: maybe no",5,0,0,18 June 2020
Lost in Translation," nah dude
","Movie is built on the alien nature of japan and the chemestry between the main characters, and both are not in my lane. there is nothing i enjoyed about this movie, and was glad when it was over.3/10: lel no",3,0,9,3 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," yikers
","The story is really bad. in short, the story is some generic heroes journey. and i felt bad for my boi palpatine. while the jedi are now OP powerhouses, with literal teleportation. my boi is stuck spamming lightningbolts. does some dualcast drainlife ONCE, and then goes back to channaling a skybeam with a low of bass. then when rey comes to fight him, guess what, back to smamming pissbolts.
aside from that. the technical stuff is pretty L9. good music, audio effects, set disign and cinematography. so at least is had someting to enjoy.6/10: good from a technical standpoint, but not a good story",6,3,6,23 March 2020
Lion," sure
","Feels a little cheesy but apart from that great movie. well made, performed and executed. i would give it a higher rating, but the movie doesnt really appeal to me that much.7/10: very good",7,0,1,4 February 2020
American Hustle," good
","Maybe a little too good to be true, so the story sometimes got a little sappy. but i had a good laugh. and the characters were amazing, solid acting right here. so ye, all in all good stuff.8/10: good movie",8,0,1,12 January 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," uh
","Fine with good action, child acting is bearable. tries to be an action movie and a drama at the same time, and end up lacking a bit of both. it comes down to an average movie.6/10: average",6,3,6,4 February 2020
The Killing Fields," strong
","Has some strong imagery, pretty good stuff. didnt really like the 1st half, but the solo story in the second made up for it. its a good movie that doesnt hold back on anything, but in terms of how much i enjoyed it, its a bit lacking6/10: good but didnt like it all that much",6,1,1,16 February 2020
Bridge of Spies," very nice
","It doesnt get too american, when you know they could have done so. there are some corny moments that are blown out of porportion but its tolerable. in the end its a lighthearted movie with a nice tone.7/10: a pleasent watch",7,0,1,19 January 2020
American Beauty," nice
","Its a nice story with great music. a little dull for me though. but i cant give it too much hate since its just a well rounded movie. its a nice and simple watch, that makes you think a little, but not too much6/10: yea sure",6,1,3,19 February 2020
Over the Hedge," nah
","Didnt laugh at any joke, and the story felt trivial. in a mad spree of rewatching animated movies from when i was a kid, this movie didnt feel worth it. some of the voice acting felt off place and i never really cared about the characters.4/10: dissapointed",4,1,1,30 May 2020
Silver Linings Playbook," average
","The love story felt pretty genuine, but its a love storty nontheless. a little predictable with a hint of cheese. movie is well made but just not my cup of tea.5/10: sure",5,0,2,7 February 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," interesting
","The movie kept me interested till the end, so thats pretty good. although the ending seemed a bit off, the rest of the movie was good. maybe the ears ringing was a overused trope, but overall the sound dising felt very well thought out.7/10: good",7,1,1,30 January 2020
American History X," sub par
","The flashback scenes are what keep this movie good. apart from the journey the older brother makes, its not much to look at. the story felt very short lived and rushed. the performances were fine i guess, but the camera work and editing we not. some jarred cuts and simple shots felt out of place and dont appeal to keep you interested.5/10: not much to care about",5,1,3,23 December 2019
No Country for Old Men," interesting
","Nice hunter/hunted movie with some dialogue. i didnt get all of it, but im sure it has some meaning. characters were really well made and performed. so a nice realistic action movie with suspence and depth.7/10: itsa fine movie",7,2,4,16 January 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Dont really know what to think
","I mean, what was the purpose of this movie. Is it to make you feel better about the actual murders that happened? So yea its weird. im sure it would all have a meaning. The jump cuts, the narriation, the skits ect. I just dint get it.
Its a very believable movie. Well shot, good props ect. But the movie felt hollow.6/10: nice and all, but kinda skattered",6,1,1,1 December 2019
Django Unchained," tarantino my boi
","All racial politics aside, good movie. this movie screams tarantino with its comedic zooms and overall camerawork. its a movie that doesnt shy away from being silly in between the serious stuff. and this movie hits a really good balance between interesting and funny.8/10: jolly good",8,1,4,12 January 2020
The Theory of Everything," emotional
","I dont often get mopey over movies, but this is one that stuck with me. the whole story arc i paced properly and well thought out. Only the ending was a little sub par, but i just cant say too much bad about this movie. its sublime.8/10: almost beautiful",8,0,1,16 January 2020
Room," good stuff
","I actually didnt mind the kid, and that sure is something. so yea, performances were pretty on point. story kept me interested, and sound and camerawork were decent.7/10: pretty good",7,0,1,6 February 2020
The Hurt Locker," okidoki
","Some intense action scenes held together with mediocre characters and story. the bomb scenes are well done and the shootouts are of the same class. but when its downtime, not much is keeping you watching. in the end there are some sharp points made but apart from those, not much.6/10: good action, but not all that new and interesting",6,1,1,26 December 2019
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," pretty good
","A coherent life story. it tries its best to capture the essence of life, and does it pretty well. ofcourse it misses some concepts, and otheres are a bit rushed, but you feel its there in some way.7/10: i nice life story, with some spicy originality",7,0,1,26 January 2020
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," sweet
","Sure i have a biased opinion. after watching this movie countless times on my mp4 player as a kid, this one is kinda special to me. so after all these years it still hold value to me. to me the dad is one of the best characters ive seen in a long time, and the movie feel genuine about its presentation of the beta personality. overall a personal gem.7/10: personal",7,0,0,30 May 2020
1917," well made
","Its a well made war movie, but falls into the blob that is war movies. it has some impressive shots but there are plenty onther war movies who have better ones. so in the gerne of war movies or just a movie in general, it lacks on quite a few fronts.6/10: not that amazing",6,3,6,13 March 2020
Lincoln," i sleep
","Too polished, too bombastic and too damn glorified. and the entire time i couldnt help but find the acting bad. Some performanced were fine, but overall i thought the dialogue was written by someone who doesnt know how to cast someone in a patriotic but human way.3/10: its just bad",3,0,4,16 January 2020
The Imitation Game," ok
","A bit by the books. you know the usual troubled mind and sorts. but all in all enjoyable, with some good performances. camerawork was a bit lacking, but sounddesign better. overall enjoyable movie7/10: enjoyed",7,0,0,7 February 2020
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," anime af
","Its corny in the fist chapter but then it find its footing. its over the top and beyond in its action scenes, and the movie knows this. halfway through it just stops the whimpy dialogue and goes full in on the music and fight geography. and brings a mix between a western and shounen.7/10: great at whats its trying to do",7,0,0,24 December 2019
Midsommar," claps
","Although i dont really like the story, let alone stupid people. this movie claps hard in the execution of everything. pacing is pretty fantastic and the camerawork doesnt shy away.8/10: ye boi",8,2,4,4 March 2020
Selma," cheese
","Gets a little cheesy in the beginning. but its becomes bearable halfway through. some acting was really bad though, and from a technical standpoint, not much was done. but in the end i think its a decent movie6/10: decent",6,1,1,6 February 2020
The Artist," a true homage
","Although i dont have much experience with silent movies , this one felt like it gives the best of its capabilities. if all silent movies were like this, i would certainly watch more. but for now, this one is one i will remember.8/10: wow",8,1,1,15 February 2020
The King," well made
","A well put together movie. it brings not much special to the medieval genre but does stand strong on the battle scenes. the movie has a high priority for realalism and accuracy, and devlivers on that front. but there is not much emotion sparked throughout the movie. it feels more like a documentary with high budget reinactments.6/10: well made, but kinda boring",6,0,1,15 December 2019
The Disaster Artist," wholesome
","I dont know how acurate it is to what really happened, but its a interesting movie.
not much to say about it as a stand alone moive, but as a follow up on the room, its quite a treat.6/10: wholesome but not too special",6,1,1,5 January 2020
Zero Dark Thirty," meh
","If this wasnt bases on true events, the movie loses a lot of its value. if you see this as a stand alone movie, not much is to say about it. just common above average performances and presentation.6/10: i guess its fine",6,0,0,16 February 2020
There Will Be Blood," ok
","I mean sure, its fine. but nothing that really cought my attention. sure its better than you average movie, but thats not enough for me. im just tired6/10: ok",6,1,9,20 February 2020
Joker," amazing everything
","A film really worthy of the batman trilogy. great acting, although sometimes seems a little over the top or too forced, but great nontheless. good message, and a good story.8/10: almost without flaw",8,1,2,13 November 2019
The Blind Side," too feelgood
","Gets a little too american for me. with its over the top happy tropes and downs. the story doesnt really offer that much originality. however, it does know what it wants to be, and succeeds at that.6/10: not really for me, but good at what it want to be",6,0,0,8 February 2020
Parasite," this aint it chief
","I dont see it. i dont see why this would be the great film everybody's talking about. the story isnt all that grand, the acting is fine, camerawork is sometimes good but mostly kept simple and the ending is also fine.6/10: good, but not great. imo overhyped",6,4,21,25 January 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," the jazz of movies
","Its a artsy movie, in the way that you can actually understand what its about. however its not for everyone. it could come off as a little bloated, or full of itself. but for me its what a great film should be from a practical standpoint.7/10: great but not in the interesting way",7,0,1,19 January 2020
The Big Short," nice
","A little documentary style story with some good performances. i wouldnt say its a substantial movie, but i enjoyed it quite so. sometimes the movie felt a little jarring with some tropes, but i didnt mind too much in the end.7/10: nice",7,1,3,7 February 2020
Marriage Story," well performed
","Action is on point in this movie. doesnt come over as over the top, and when you feel like it does, its justified. storywise its a bit stale. camerawork is done well, with the use of static and dinamic shots in the same scenes. overall a good movie, but not good enough for me to keep me interested 100% of the time.6/10: very good acting, but sub par story",6,1,2,1 February 2020
The Croods," ok
","Nothing too special, but not really bad either. just fine is how i would decribe it. somewhat unique setting, but not too much.5/10: not much to say about",5,0,1,13 March 2020
Jojo Rabbit," unique
",To combine war and comedy is a new one. but i feel like it was stuck between the two. i think the movie should have gone all in with the comedy and a little less with the romance. but in the end its a decent movie.6/10: ok,6,3,7,7 February 2020
Sin City," a true gem
","All the subtlety is thrown out the window and we are left with a unapologetic beauty. almost everything is over the top, and plays perfecty with absurdist humor. its almost perfect in what its trying to be. a satire noir film with over the top drama, action and story.8/10: what a beaut",8,0,0,23 December 2019
Up in the Air," its good
","Good bundle of performances, but it gets a little sappy for me. only the relationshiptwist for clooney felt thought out. i would say this is your average movie that wont dissapoint, but wont blow you away either.6/10: good",6,0,0,16 February 2020
