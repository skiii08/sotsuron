The Lobster," Surreal, Absurd, Endearing & Funny; THE LOBSTER is a Bizarre One I Highly Recommend
","The latest film I can obsessively recommend to my friends, knowing they'll probably never watch it, is THE LOBSTER. I think I first took notice of it when Cracked mentioned it in an article on (then) upcoming insane movies that weren't getting enough attention and the plot synopsis demanded I track down this movie and watch it as soon as I could. In THE LOBSTER, Colin Farrell is a man who is recently single and must attend a program wherein he has 45 days to find a new mate or he will be turned into an animal. He chooses as his potential future animal a lobster because of their long life, blue blood, and lifetime of fertility. The film, from Greek writer/director Yorgos Lanthimos, is set in a dystopian world where relationships are government- regulated and loners, those who manage to escape their transformative fate, are outcasts that live in the forests. People attending the resort in search of a mate can extend their time through a hunting ritual where they're released into the woods with tranquilizer guns to hunt the loners, garnering additional days for every loner they bring in for transformation. The film chronicles the desperation of our main character David (Farrell) as he does whatever he can to find a new connection before accepting more drastic measures and going the route of a fugitive loner, where he happens to meet a lovely woman (Rachel Weisz) who might in fact be his ideal mate, assuming they get out alive.THE LOBSTER is a surreal gem of a film that I can't seem to shake from my mind for a while after watching it. There's just so much here to break down and examine. I'm obsessed with the strange world that Lanthimos and co- writer Efthymis Filippou have created. We've got this bizarre world where the government mandates that everyone must have a mate to the point where, if authorities see you wandering a city alone, they can demand to see your papers verifying your relationship status. There's a strange recurring theme where you can only exist as either end of a spectrum with no gray area in between. For example, in addition to the outright relationship vs. loner existence, there's a moment at the beginning of the film where David is partaking in the resort's entrance exam and he's asked his sexual orientation. He claims as heterosexual but then admits he had engaged in some experimentation at a point earlier in life and wanted to know if he could be labeled bisexual but, no, this isn't allowed (there is some mention that this had caused some complications within the program at some point in the past). Each society exists by a strict set of rules that operate as polar opposites; masturbation at the resort will get your hand mauled whereas making out in the loner tribe will scar you with the 'red kiss'. It's all so strange and infinitely interesting with a hint of vague social commentary on relationships within.I find it difficult to make a case for people to check out THE LOBSTER. If you're not as intrigued by the strange world Lanthimos and Filippou have created as I am, you might find the movie dull. It's got a very dry sense of humor and all of the dialogue is delivered in a flat, matter-of-fact manner with little or no emotion with few exceptions. The characters are almost robotic in their behavior and the only ones who come across as near-human are David and Weisz's short-sighted woman. There's another strange element: Farrell's David is the only character in the entire movie with a name. Everyone else is defined by a trait. Weisz is short-sighted. John C. Reilly has a lisp. Ben Wishaw has a limp. The characters populating the world of THE LOBSTER define themselves by one outstanding trait and seek their mate based on that trait, to the point that some will even fake it just to avoid transformation; even when not trapped in the 'civilized' world, David desperately seeks that shared trait with the short-sighted woman to feel secure in his affections for her. I find more to love about this quirky little film the more I mull it over in my mind and I'm sure there's an audience for this sort of oddity out there but I know it could very well be off-putting for a lot of people. It's surreal, absurd, funny, and endearing, and now I kind of want to watch it again.",8,0,1,21 August 2017
The Avengers," A Major Win for Marvel, Whedon, and Fans
","Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have accomplished something that I never thought would've been possible. I am giving this movie a perfect rating and, yes, I'm aware that it is not the greatest film of all time and I recognize that it is not without its flaws. But it is a fantastic summer action movie with some of the greatest comic book action we've gotten so far in film and, when you really think about a movie with the scope of THE AVENGERS, this movie could've failed in so many ways. But it didn't. It amazed. It was beyond fun. It was an excellent finale to what Marvel has come to refer to as 'Phase I', which means we can expect to see more story lines and characters overlapping in Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's made me so freakin' excited to see what the future holds for Marvel's film franchises. The movie begins as we see S.H.I.E.L.D. in possession of the Tesseract from CAPTAIN America, experimenting in the possibility of unlimited clean energy. Unfortunately, the Tesseract has attracted the attention of Loki and whatever dark forces he's bargained with. Loki has plans on using the Tesseract to open a portal to another dimension and bring war to Earth with aspirations of enslaving the human race. Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are in over their heads but, thankfully, the past year has introduced a series of superheroes that might come in handy in just such a scenario: Iron Man, the Hulk, Thor, and Captain America. But can these super-egos work together toward a common goal without imploding on themselves?The odds were against this movie. There were so many reasons this might not have worked. Ensemble movies can be difficult, especially when you have a ton of stars and beloved characters to juggle. Every character needs ample screen time to justify their existence in the film and give each fan a chance to enjoy a hero moment with their favorite character. In addition to all of this, I was concerned that the villain for the film was a weak selection. Loki was the antagonist of 2011's THOR and, while this is only my opinion, THOR was the least incredible of the first phase of Marvel movies. Loki worked within the scope of that movie but I wasn't sure he could carry a movie of this size as the primary villain. Yeah, I was wrong. I thought Tom Hiddleston had done a great job in THOR and he pushes his character a little closer to crazier here. He's an ample villain for a first time teaming of these heroes and, for the final battle, he calls in more than enough reinforcements to give us the epic action we expect when you bring these four heroes to the big screen in the same movie. Joss Whedon is one of the few who could have pulled off an AVENGERS movie as well as he did. The man knows how to juggle a large cast and give everyone a chance to shine. He even manages to give Black Widow a healthy role while bringing Hawkeye into the mix (somewhat).If you're at all a fan of Marvel's movies leading up to this point, I'm all but sure you'll be satisfied with THE AVENGERS. One of Marvel's biggest strengths has been finding the perfect cast and directors to bring their heroes to life. Now we get a half dozen together at once. Robert Downey Jr. steals the spotlight for the majority of the film but, seeing as how Iron Man is the most established and a guaranteed crowd favorite, it was to be expected. Chris Evans continues to prove he was an ideal choice for Steve Rogers, and Chris Hemsworth is still the perfect God of Thunder. One of the biggest surprises was Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner. I was a bit upset when it was revealed that Ed Norton wouldn't be reprising his role, and I thought Mark Ruffalo was an odd choice to replace him. But, man, he was great. Seriously, I hope he jumps into the character in the same way Hugh Jackman's embraced Wolverine. He's a great Banner and an even better Hulk, easily the best version of the Hulk we've had at the movies. The special effects in the movie are great, the battles are epic, and we even get a few hero vs. hero fight sequences that they knew we'd be itching to see. The Incredible Hulk battling Thor? I'm in.On the other end of the spectrum, my complaints are few and far between. The movie keeps a great pace, only slowing down once near the middle following the massive Helicarrier sequence. The alien menace (I won't reveal their identity on the off chance someone reading this hasn't seen the movie yet) were nothing more than cannon fodder at the end but it made for a fantastic battle. Other than that...? Yeah, nothing. There's a lot I loved about this movie. It was a great culmination of everything we'd seen building in the previous movies. The chemistry between the cast/characters was great with a budding friendship between Stark and Banner and a bit of a rivalry between Stark and Rogers. There's a lot going on and plenty of action to keep the pace rocketing through the nearly 2.5 hour runtime. THE AVENGERS was a major victory for both Marvel Studios and comic/movie fans.",10,2,5,24 December 2012
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It's Time for the Bride to Kill Bill...
","The Bride reaches the conclusion to her quest for revenge! After the first volume followed the Bride's confrontations with the first two targets (Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii), the second volume shows her hunt for the remaining two DiVAS members, as well as Bill himself. We really struck me as odd about volume two was that it was a COMPLETELY different style than its predecessor. Where volume one was a bloody kung-fu exploitation film, volume two tones it down and delves more into the story. It goes into greater detail about what led up to the attack on the Bride, as well as where she received her training that turned her into one of the most dangerous women in the world.This volume has considerably less violence and less bloodshed. The fights are still spectacular with some of the greatest choreography I've seen in modern movies. The fights are brutal and still pack a serious punch. The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is basically an all-out brawl with elements of martial arts giving it some grace. As I said before, we are given more story in this volume so we get more information around the legend of the Bride. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be the chapter dealing with her training under Pai Mei (Gordon Liu); I really just loved the character. As a result of increased storytelling, the movie does move at a slightly slower pace than the first volume but it never fully stalls.Michael Madsen rocks in this movie, but then again I like him in pretty much every role I've seen him in. My favorite addition to this volume was Bill himself. David Carradine almost made me sympathetic for the character when he explains the rationale behind his actions. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit anti-climactic compared to what I went into the movie expecting. For an entire 4 hour saga revolving around the hunt for Bill, I expected something more explosive. It was still a satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's epic tale of revenge and helped make the 'Kill Bill' saga one of Tarantino's best pieces of work.",9,1,2,26 December 2007
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," The First MOCKINGJAY Feels Like a Major Departure for the Franchise
","The saga of Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and the growing rebellion against the capitol of the fictional nation Panem continues in THE HUNGER GAMES: MOCKINGJAY – PART I. A franchise aimed to teenaged girls and, here I am, three movies deep and undoubtedly going to watch the grand finale. Movies based on young adult novels generally send me running (I've never seen the Twilight movies or the Divergent movies, and I never intend to), but I can't deny that this series is actually done really, really well. I actually really enjoyed CATCHING FIRE (the second of the series) and it got me excited to see this one. The movie begins immediately after the previous events, where we saw Katniss being airlifted out of the Quarter Quell games after literally blowing the lid off the whole operation with an electrified arrow that shorted out the force field around the game field. We rejoin her in the mythical District 13; thought to be an unlivable wasteland following a previous rebellion, District 13 operates in tight military fashion from underground bunkers. Far from dead, the inhabitants are going strong and planning the next move against the Capitol. Support for the rebellion is growing in the other districts despite President Snow's (Donald Sutherland) declaration that any sign of dissent be eliminated with extreme prejudice. Now the rebellion wants to rally the people together under the symbol of the Mockingjay/Katniss. But Katniss is suffering a bit of post-traumatic stress from the games and she's worried about Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who we know had been left behind following Katniss's rescue. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the beginning of the end, where Katniss must rise up to meet her responsibility as a figurehead for rebellion even if it means earning President Snow's personal vengeance.First impression of MOCKINGJAY 1, it's a major departure in style from the previous two movies. HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE were vibrant films, with bright colors all over the scenes in the Capitol and then the beautifully shot wilderness in the course of the games. MOCKINGJAY 1 is the depressing opposite. This is a movie about flickering remains of hope and it wants you to feel the same oppressive dread as the inhabitants of District 13. Gone is the bright wilderness in favor of underground concrete bunkers where the population all wears drab blue jumpsuits. Even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks), the series' resident peacock and Katniss's personal attendant from the Games, is neutered, relegated to patchwork jumpsuits and scarves. All of the beautiful imagery of the Capitol's effluence is gone so that the audience can be brought down the reality of their suffering. While the first two films would probably be considered action/adventure with science fiction elements, MOCKINGJAY 1 is a war film (with sci-fi elements). No joke, this is a war film closer in spirit to PLATOON or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (though, of course, toned way down as to be appropriate for a younger audience). We confront the realities of conflict such as refugees, collateral damage, and self-sacrifice for the common good. It's nuts and nothing like I expected. At one point, Snow callously orders the bombing of a refugee hospital in one of the districts and we're right there with Katniss as, after everything she's already been through, she watches the incineration of men, women, and children and can do nothing to stop it. Heavy stuff for a teen movie.These movies have, no doubt, made Jennifer Lawrence's career. She is a talented woman and these movies brought her into the spotlight where she was able to latch on to bigger and better things; yet she still continues to return to the character that brought her to the top of her game and she still gives it her all. Katniss, in MOCKINGJAY 1, is at her worst. She's mentally-broken, she's terrified for Peeta, and she is constantly reminded of the pressure on her shoulders as the one person who can unite the districts against the Capitol. In the previous movies, she's shown the strength and conviction of her character but now she's getting angry. Lawrence handles it all effortlessly and brings the viewer along with her in what serves as her character's big transformation. On these same lines, it's worth mentioning the pedigree of acting talent these movies attract. In addition to the returning cast from previous movies (including Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland, Jeffrey Wright, and Philip Seymour Hoffman), MOCKINGJAY 1 adds Julianne Moore as President Coin, head of District 13 and the rebellion. She's the no-nonsense sort who oversees operations in 13 with military precision, but her intentions seem pure. She recognizes the importance of Katniss's involvement but she's rightfully hesitant at first to put all her faith into one girl and risk everything she's accomplished so far. Hoffman and Liam Hemsworth get upgraded to larger roles. Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee) has betrayed the Capitol and operates as Coin's head of propaganda, and Hemsworth (as Gale, Katniss's former flame from her time in District 12) is now a militant rebel intent on doing his part in bringing down Snow. Having been out of the picture during Katniss's time in the Games, the two of them reconnect but he's no longer interested in pursuing their relationship as a) he's got more important things to worry about now and b) Katniss has obviously developed feelings for Peeta. This not-quite-love-triangle is mercifully given little screen time whereas other young adult movies would probably make it the focus.MOCKINGJAY 1 is a drastic departure from the tone of the first two movies and I wouldn't be surprised to find out it may've turned off some of the younger viewers. It's a pretty good film but you can tell it's just killing time until MOCKINGJAY 2 for the big final battle. Despite some pacing flaws and the general aura of depression, it's a nice lead-in to the final act and an interesting progression for the franchise.",7,2,5,7 November 2015
Black Swan," Natalie Portman's Best Performance
","I've sort of fallen away from Darren Aronofsky over the past few years. I loved both PI and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, but the unenthusiastic reviews for THE FOUNTAIN kept me from running out to see it and I've still not gotten around to THE WRESTLER. I probably wouldn't have even bothered with BLACK SWAN due to my complete disinterest in all things ballet-related except all the critical buzz caught my attention. And it doesn't hurt that Natalie Portman is probably my favorite actress working in Hollywood at the moment. The film focuses on Nina Sayers (Portman), a dedicated ballerina who aspires to perfection in her craft at the constant encouragement of her mother (Barbara Hershey), a former ballerina past her prime who never reached the spotlight. When her ballet troupe is to set to begin rehearsals for Swan Lake, Nina is determined to acquire the starring role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan but her instructor (Vincent Cassel) finds her too controlled. Enter Lily: a wild child from San Francisco who urges Nina to unleash her wild side. Soon, Nina's psyche begins to crack under the pressure of her obsession with the role and her delving into the passionate mind of the Black Swan.I love a good film that deals with a person's descent into madness and if there's one thing Aronofsky appears to understand, it's madness. From the beginning, we see small signs that all is not right in the mind of Portman's Nina. Her mother is an obviously overbearing sort, living her ballet dreams vicariously through the successes of her daughter. Her mother's blatant mental abuse has taken a toll on Nina and it's made apparent when she nearly loses her chance to tackle the dual role of the Swan Queen/Black Swan in her company's rendition of Swan Lake. Thomas Leroy, director of the ballet company, feels Nina is perfect in technique but lacks the passion and ability to let loose for the role of the Black Swan. As Nina succumbs to Leroy's sexual tensions and the arrival of party-girl Lily, we watch as Nina suffers worse and worse hallucinations as well as bizarre transformations as Nina slowly embodies the Black Swan.I think what I found most appealing about this film was Natalie Portman. She's definitely a strong actress (see V FOR VENDETTA) but here we see her as a tortured individual whose grip on reality is slipping. She nails it here and, while I can't say for certain because I hadn't seen any of the other Best Actress nominees, she seems to me deserving of the Oscar she won (or at least worthy of the nomination). Mila Kunis takes an interesting turn. I'm so accustomed to seeing her in goofy comedies (FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL) that it was interesting to see her take on more of a 'bad girl' image and prove that serious drama is in her realm of talent. I am also to see that Aronofsky maintains the unique style of his filmmaking I loved in his early films and it's given me motivation to check out the few I've missed. BLACK SWAN is a taut thriller in my opinion, despite what nay-saying I've heard from friends and those online. It's a tense film and the final act in which Nina's mind finally crumbles in the Swan Lake performance is one of the best sequences I'd watched all year.",9,2,3,2 August 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A Better PotC Movie Than Most People Will Give It Credit For
","When a film franchise has made as much cash as Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean, you know it'll take more than the end of a trilogy to put it to rest. I guess I always sort of knew another movie would make its way to theaters, but I admit I was still surprised when Disney announced a brand new sequel four years after the complicated conclusion of AT WORLD'S END. Well, when a new movie is inevitable, all we can do is hope they fix the mistakes of the first few movies without making rather than just horribly botching what was once an entertaining, if overly complex, series. Captain Jack Sparrow returns to continue the journey hinted about at the end of the last film: the search for the Fountain of Youth. After narrowly escaping arrest in London, Sparrow learns that there is an imposter posing as him in an effort to scrounge up a crew. His investigations land him enslaved on the Queen Anne's Revenge as part of Blackbeard's crew. The infamous pirate and his first mate Angelica (his daughter and one-time lover to Captain Jack) are in search of the Fountain of Youth before a prophecy can be realized: it has been foreseen that a one-legged man will kill Blackbeard. That one-legged man is none other than Captain Hector Barbossa; no longer a pirate, Barbossa sails for England as a privateer. The race is on as Blackbeard, the English, and the Spanish hope to be the first to the Fountain.To start, I can't be the only one who doesn't think this isn't the worst film in the series. In fact, I actually really liked it. It's definitely better than AT WORLD'S END, and I'd say it's at least as good as CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. I enjoy this film because it doesn't over-extend itself with a multitude of story lines, dozens of supporting characters, or overzealous special effects. This movie feels more like a straightforward pirate adventure film. It does maintain a handful of supernatural aspects, but you expect a couple bits of mysticism in a good pirate movie. Whereas the first three movies always felt as if there was way too much going on, the story here is simple: a race to the Fountain. I admit it's a little sad to have a PotC movie without the Black Pearl and her crew, but the movie hints that we should be seeing her again in any future sequels (which I suppose are guaranteed with the roughly $1 billion worldwide box office this film pulled in). The movie is a lot of fun, with enough action scattered throughout to keep the adventurous pace. For whatever reason, I actually didn't care for the film when I first saw it in theaters (the wasted 3D didn't help the matter). I realized it's because I went in expecting another bloated, colorful PotC that I've grown accustomed to, and ON STRANGER TIDES breaks from that mold with a simplified, darker pirate adventure tale. I've since come to find the fourth movie as one of my favorites.You know what I really loved about this movie? No Kiera Knightley and no Orlando Bloom. Good riddance. Their characters, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, are primarily responsible for what is wrong with the first three movies, in my opinion. Those fact that these two incredibly boring individuals were such pivotal roles dragged the series down. But now they're gone! Thank God for the Flying Dutchman. Not only did they do away with the two weakest characters, but they brought back one of my favorites (Barbossa). Next to Captain Jack, Barbossa is the greatest part of the series (probably because he less goofy and more.uhmpirate than Sparrow). Ian McShane makes an even better villain as Blackbeard. If you've ever seen HBO's 'Deadwood', you know McShane can do stone-cold. Give him a cutlass and a supernatural pirate galleon and you've got yourself an awesome baddie. Penelope Cruz is Blackbeard's daughter Angelica. She's infinitely hotter than Elizabeth Swann ever was, plus she's got a fiery personality that Knightley could've only dreamt of in her time with PotC. The movie misfires a bit by giving a preacher and the mermaid he loves a little more screen time than necessary, but it only slows the story down minimally. I really don't know why more people enjoy this movie for what it is. Kudos to screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio who've been with this franchise from the beginning and took a chance to change up the routine we've all grown so used to. At this rate, I'd probably support a fifth installment if Johnny Depp is up for another round as Captain Jack Sparrow.",8,1,2,5 January 2012
Men in Black 3," The MiB are Back and Almost as Fun as Before
","The original MEN IN BLACK was awesome. I remember watching it and hoping it became a continuing franchise. Then MEN IN BLACK II came out and I took it all back. What a bomb. I can't say I was all that disappointed when it looked like the second movie might've killed the franchise. If that was the sort of movies they were going to put out, let the franchise die before it got any worse. Surprised doesn't even begin to describe my reaction when I found out they were making a third movie. It had been ten years since the second movie. It seemed a little late to go diving back into that well, but whatever. Ten years should be enough time to get a story right. I guess it wasn't though, because I'd read that the script wasn't even complete when they started shooting MEN IN BLACK 3. It wasn't a good sign. I guess there were a lot of problems during production, so I didn't get my hopes up. Regardless, I was hoping this movie might reinvigorate the series. The third film returns to Agents J and K doing their MiB routine. When K fails to show any form of emotion at Agent Zed's funeral, J begins to question just what happened to turn K into the cold man his is now. He'll get his chance when a criminal from K's past, Boris the Animal, breaks out of prison and travels to 1969 to kill K and negate Earth's orbital protection system. To save K's life and prevent an Earth invasion, J must travel back in time to save the future.I'm hesitant to label MEN IN BLACK 3 a total disappointment because there are some really good elements to it. I loved the time travel element, and 1969 was a great time to incorporate. The birth of America's space exploration and a time ripe with it's own brand of cheesy sci-fi movies. When J arrives in MiB HQ in 1969, all of the flashy, sleek aliens we're accustomed to are gone and replaced with rubber suits and glass bowl helmets. It was a great touch. I loved the early versions of popular MiB gear (e.g. K's corded neurolyzer with it's dial-up modem connection), and Bill Hader's got a great cameo as Andy Warhol. I wish more had been done with the 1969 environment but I guess the filmmakers could only fit so much into the movie while keeping the plot on track. Josh Brolin was a perfect choice as a young Tommy Lee Jones/Agent K. He totally nails every little nuance of Jones's character, adding some new life of his own. This movie wouldn't have worked half as well without Brolin's performance. The first half of MEN IN BLACK 3 was a lot of fun and hearkened back to the best elements of the first movie. I was ready and willing to forget the misstep that was MEN IN BLACK II. For the most part, I would call MEN IN BLACK 3 a surprising success but it wasn't perfect.The second half of the move starts to drag, right about the time a fifth-dimensional alien named Griffin arrives in the movie. The character isn't so much a drag; in fact, I thought he was a pretty unique creation for the movie and done well with a performance by Michael Stuhlbarg. It's just that his arrival signifies the start of the less exciting, more emotional parts of the movie. If I'm watching one of these movies, I want crazy sci-fi action and bizarre aliens with end-of-the-world intentions. I don't watch them for an emotional core. It slows down the fun. I can get drama from other movies. There's a big element in this movie about the relationship between J and K and it dominates the second half of the film. Then there's Boris the Animal. He's not a bad villain. He's not on the level of Serleena and her Johnny Knoxville henchman of the second movie, but he's nowhere near as cool or threatening as Edgar the bug. I think Jermaine Clement is a funny dude. He was the best part of DINNER FOR SCHMUCKS. But his Boris is just a snarling, over-loud mess. He's roars most of his lines and fires bone quills from his hands. Not bad, but there's been better alien baddies. With a little more effort into the script, this might've been as good as the first but, even with its flaws, it turned out surprisingly well. It's got me interested again in the chance of continuing the franchise.",7,5,8,30 January 2013
Scarface," A Drug-Fueled Epic on Greed/Excess
","It's almost pointless to comment on a classic movie like SCARFACE because it's one of those movies that just about everyone's already seen and formed an opinion on. And based on the cult status the movie has achieved, popular in rap music with loads of movie merchandise overflowing on the shelves at your local Spencer's, its love is pretty universal. Brian De Palma's classic is the ultimate depiction of the 80's cocaine scene. At nearly three hours long, it's an epic about the rise to power of one man through the ranks of the international drug trade. Based on the 1932 movie of the same name (and the novel from Armitage Trail), it follows Cuban immigrant Tony Montana as he arrives in Miami in 1980 as one of the Cuban prisoners lumped into the mass emigration to get rid of his countries worst offenders. He arrives in the States with nothing but wastes no time in attracting the attention of the crime world when he assassinates a political prisoner in exchange for his green card. From there, he uses his brutal nature and honorable business ethic to climb to the top of Miami's cocaine trade, stomping out anyone who makes the mistake of crossing him. Still SCARFACE is, if anything, a morality tale where money and power lead to paranoia and eventually a tragic end. SCARFACE is iconic and has left it's impression on just about every aspect of our culture, from music to the video game industry (pretty obvious if you've ever played 'Grand Theft Auto: Vice City'.Yeah, I'm one of the millions that consider this an awesome movie. And it's no surprise why it's become so popular: it's the ultimate underdog story. Montana begins the movie with nothing but his ambitions. He follows his own code of ethics, believing in honest business dealings but unafraid of resorting to violence when he needs to set an example. He sets his sights on his employer's beautiful wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer), regardless of the risk. And with nothing but his 'balls and his word', he accomplishes everything he sets out to do. You can't help but cheer him on because Al Pacino as Montana is just so freakin' charismatic from the very start when we meet him during an interrogation with Federal Customs agents. It's no wonder what everyone wants to be Tony Montana, despite the fact that he'syou knowa drug dealer. The movie has gotten some heat for it's supposed glorification of violence and cocaine, but it's really nothing of the sort. Sure, Montana is a violent man and engages in some pretty horrible dealings but, the fact of the matter is, he pays for it all in the end. The movie doesn't leave you with fuzzy feelings and delusions of the easy life. It's a warning about how bad business leads to bad times. Montana gets what he deserves by the end of the movie, in probably the best final standoff ever put to film.No offense to more hardcore Pacino fans, but this is his best role in my opinion. He's suave, charming, and dangerous. You can't go far without seeing Montana's face plastered on something; even I used to have a SCARFACE cigarette case with the trademark black and white poster image. Michelle Pfeiffer is gorgeous as Elvira, the drugged-out woman of Montana's dreams. Beautiful on the outside, dead on the inside; Elvira acts as a spoil to Montana's ambitions. She reminds him that he's nothing more than a trigger-happy villain who deals in drugsa man so obsessed with his money and business that nothing else matters. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is Montana's younger sister Gina, a naïve woman who's begun dabbling in the dark side of Miami's scene. There's an almost incestuous undertone to the way Montana acts over-protective of his sister, going into a frenzy at the mere thought that another man has his hands on her. The movie also boasts great performances from Steven Bauer, F. Murray Abraham, Robert Loggia, and Paul Shenar. There's a lot of talent in this movie, and some incredible production value to boot. It doesn't hurt that this movie was shot in the early '80s and perfectly able to capture the bright neon veneer of the cocaine decade. The '80s are universally accepted as the decade of excess, and this movie is all about the excess. The style, the violence, the 'yeyo', the killer montageSCARFACE is certainly epic.",8,0,2,28 August 2012
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," High Five!
","I had never seen 'Da Ali G Show' before watching this movie and had no prior exposure to Sacha Baron Cohen. I only knew what I saw from the trailers. Borat Sagdiyev (Cohen) is a reporter from the nation of Kazakhstan who is sent to America to learn as much as possible in an effort to improve his home nation. What follows is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen. I could NOT stop laughing throughout the course of this movie when I saw it for the first time. Of course, not everyone is going to like this film. In fact, most of the people I've watched it with can't stand it. They either find the character of Borat too obnoxious/annoying or they are bothered in some way by the content. Oh well, it's not for everyone.The film is hilarious, but the humor is mostly derived from shock value. Unfortunately, that means that repeated viewings lose some of their luster because you know what to expect. The real comedy comes from the reactions of those that Borat encounters on his trip across America. You can tell that SOME situations have to have been staged but a good majority seem like sincere (and funny) reactions to Borat's foreign behavior. Some articles that I've read claim this movie acts as a social commentary on the behaviors of Americans in relation to a culture they don't understand. I can see how that can be true...to an extent. Then again, Borat does some pretty crazy things, things that go beyond a mere culture clash, in this film to justify some of the responses he received.My absolute favorite segments had to have been the scene with the driving instructor and the scene with the frat boys in the RV. Despite Borat's oddball (and occasionally illegal) behavior in the driving school scene, the driving instructor took it in stride and let it roll off his back...which I thought made it that much funnier. As for the frat boys, they just made complete morons out of themselves. Both of these scenes resulted in lawsuits brought up against the production, though I don't know that either made it very far.On one final note, if you want a good example of American intolerance in the film (WITHOUT goading from Borat), be sure to check out the friendly advice given to Borat by the rodeo organizer before Borat performs the national anthem.",8,1,2,6 April 2008
Alien 3," ALIEN 3 Fails to Live Up to Franchise Standards
","I really wanted to enjoy this movie more than I did. The original ALIEN remains one of my absolute favorite movies and the sequel, ALIENS, is still one of James Cameron's best films in my opinion. It's just a shame that the third installment couldn't continue with the same success. From everything I've read and seen, David Fincher's film was plagued with any and all possible obstacles that could possibly befall it, which contributed to the resulting mundane film. Multiple rewrites, budget issues, and crew changes nearly destroyed the film before it was ever completed, but credit is still due to David Fincher and his editor Terry Rawlings for creating a something cohesive out of all the trouble. The film begins at an undetermined amount of time after the events of ALIENS, in which an electrical fire aboard the Sulaco ejects Ripley's cryotube in an escape pod, stranding her on the planet Fiorina 161 (or Fury 161). The planet is a maximum security men's work correctional facility where the prisoners have accepted religion and are less than thrilled to have a woman wandering amongst them. Their differences are soon forgotten as Ripley discovers that an egg had stowed away aboard the escape pod and there is now an alien picking off the colony population one by one.I appreciate the fact the Fincher and the writers attempted to get back to the roots of the franchise, relying on suspenseful horror instead of action (not that Cameron's action approach was in any way unsatisfying, because it rocked). For whatever reason, this film just fell flat. The first half kept the pace with Ripley integrating into the prison population and investigating clues that she may have had a stowaway, then the arrival of the alien in it's usual gruesome manner. As soon as the initial attacks are over, the film slows to a crawl while the surviving prisoners frequently huddle together and plan how to capture or destroy the creature. Sadly, the final act suffers just as well when the prisoner's plan to kill the creature comes to fruition in a lengthy chase sequence.Sigourney Weaver, of course, reprises her role as Ellen Ripley and continues to grow stronger in the role. The best supporting cast are also, sadly, some of the shortest-lived: Charles Dance (as the colony's medical officer Clemens) and Brian Glover (as superintendent Andrews). The deaths of the characters were necessary to place the prisoners in a leader-less situation so I can understand why, but it still would've been nice to get some more of Charles Dance in the film. Unfortunately, with the exception of Charles S. Dutton, the rest of the cast blends together into a sea of shaved heads and it becomes incredibly difficult at points (particularly those of high action) to distinguish who is who. Despite it's flaws, the film has it's moments and the performances manage to keep it afloat. It's just sad that the end to the official Alien 'trilogy' had to end on such a flat note.",5,0,2,2 February 2010
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Even Better than the First Movie; Fans Should Love It
","I really enjoyed Guy Ritchie's first SHERLOCK HOLMES. So I should warn those who didn't, you may as well just move along. But if you're like me and thought his first movie was a fun new spin on the classic character, then you'll probably have a blast here because it's even better the second time around. The second movie ramps everything up to the next level with a stronger story and better action sequences while retaining all of the fun elements of the first film. I haven't gotten tired of this series yet, and if Ritchie can keep the movies as entertaining as they've been, I hope we'll get a few more out of him. A GAME OF SHADOWS adopts elements from the Holmes tale 'The Final Problem' (one of Doyle's stories I haven't had a chance to read) with the battle of wits between Holmes and his nemesis. As the movie begins, Holmes and Watson have gone their separate ways as Watson prepares for the approaching marriage to his fiancée Mary. Meanwhile, Holmes is deep into his latest investigation surrounding recent events: bombings, suspicious deaths, countries on the brink of war. All of the trails he has uncovered converge on one man: Professor James Moriarty. Holmes fears that Moriarty's plans might have worldwide consequences and enlists the aid of his trusted colleague Watson one last time in a bid to uncover the nefarious plot and put an end to it. But Holmes may have met his intellectual match in the professorYou won't hear me complaining about Ritchie's action-infused version of the classic detective. If you want the usual Holmes sleuthing, there are hundreds of other sources out there, but I like to think Ritchie's movies maintain the heart of Holmes while adding a nice action punch to kick it up a notch. I love the 'Holmesavision' method of sharing Holmes' train of thought and bring the audience into his mind while he does his does best. There's an awesome moment in the final act of the film where we experience to two genius minds attempting to out-smart each other when Holmes confronts Moriarty. It was a cool means of bringing something new to my favorite element of these movies. The story is fun, with Holmes and Watson breaking free from the confines of England to travel Europe in their pursuits this time around. The action sequences are bigger and more extravagant and Ritchie loads it up with his slow-motion/ramped speed, stop-n-go style. Another aspect I appreciated in the film, the stakes definitely feel higher. There are a few moments in the movie where I genuinely wondered if all of the characters would make it out alive, and at times wondered if Ritchie planned on ending the franchise here before it went any further. A GAME OF SHADOWS is a total blast, and I'd go so far as to say it was one of my favorite movies of 2012. My only concern is that it couldn't be topped in a third movie. The scope on this one is about as large as a good Holmes movie can get without going too over-the-top, and they've already brought out the detectives most cunning enemy: Moriarty.If you want to make a blockbuster icon out of Sherlock Holmes, you can't do better than Robert Downey Jr. He continues to be great in the role, even if he does come off as a little cartoonish this time around. RDJ brings equal parts eccentric and intelligent to the character and comes across as just shy of insane. Jude Law is again the perfect straightman as John Watson. He looks like he's having more fun this time and has a few funny moments of his own. Rachel McAdams was my least favorite part of the first movie and I'm happy to say her character, Irene Adler, receives no more than 5 minutes of screen time. The best characters in this movie, though, are the newcomers. Stephen Fry (as Mycroft Holmes) and Jared Harris (Moriarty) steal their scenes. Harris was a great choice for Moriarty. There had been a lot of early talk that Ritchie and the producers had been considering some A-list names for the character, but it worked so much better with Harris. He's confident, conniving, and sociopathic. He's a perfect Moriarty for this sort of Holmes film. Noomi Rapace (from the Swedish Millennium trilogy) has a role as a gypsy fortuneteller drawn into the chase, but she hasn't got much to do here.Whether or not A GAME OF SHADOWS is worth your time all boils down to whether you are a fan of Ritchie's vision for the character. Being a fan of the first, I absolutely loved this one. It's an action-oriented SHERLOCK HOLMES on a bigger scale and an excellent chess match in the final act to sum up the battle of two great minds.",9,0,0,4 September 2012
The Incredible Hulk," An Incredible Reboot
","I was not one of those who hated Ang Lee's 2003 portrayal of the Hulk. I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.One issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.In general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).It's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was 'That's IT?!'. Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.",8,27,41,16 November 2008
Mission: Impossible III," A Fun Return to Form for the Series Following the Disappointing M:I:II
","Needing to flush the sour taste of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II from my mind, I've followed it with a viewing of the 2006 installment, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III. The third film in the ongoing franchise is the on I'm least familiar with. I didn't get around to seeing it in theaters and I watched once when it was released on DVD before my copy was lost. At the time, I remembered this one blowing my mind and establishing itself as my favorite of the series. Does it hold up now? Mostly, yeah. I don't rank it as my favorite of the original three films anymore (that honor returns to the original 1996 film) but it's still significantly better and more entertaining than the second film. From J.J. Abrams in his feature-film directing debut, the movie begins as IMF agent Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) has settled down in life. He is no longer a field agent, opting to train new agents so he can build a stable life with his fiancée Julia (Michelle Monaghan). When Hunt learns a former protégé (Keri Russell) has gone missing on an operation where she was assigned to follow notorious arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman), Hunt rejoins his team to bring her home. But it won't be that easyDavian is a mad-man and he's not afraid to murder in cold-blood to discourage others from interfering in his business. Hunt is about to learn the dangers of crossing one of the most powerful, well-connected international criminals when you've got something to lose.M:I:III improves over its immediate predecessor by scaling down the action and making it serve the plot, instead of vice versa. The action isn't the centerpiece; the characters are. Specifically, Hunt. This is a personal mission for him. He personally trained Lindsey Farris, the agent captured in the beginning, and feels responsible for bringing her home safe. Later in the film, Davian discovers that Hunt has a pressure point in the form of his new wife and uses it to control the situation. These, my friends, are stakes and what M:I:II was missing to make me care about Hunt and Nyah. We get to spend some time with Hunt and Julia in the first act of the film and see them interact. We get a sense of their relationship and how happy they make each other. Hunt is so in love that he's willing to quit his globe-trotting life of spy adventures for the woman. See? Character development. Even Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), member of Hunt's team since the first film, gets it better this time around and isn't limited to whining about his Gucci shoes. The villain of the piece, as played by Hoffman, is a terrifying man without having to do much. From the moment the movie opens, we see the lengths the man will go to get what he wants. He never loses his cool. He's calm, collected, and soft-spoken and it works for him because we've seen how dangerous he is. Hoffman's a pro and makes for an excellent baddie.I'd stated before that the action is 'scaled down' in this one and that's because it goes for quality over quantity. There are some pretty sweet action sequences in M:I:III. There's an awesome helicopter chase through a wind farm and the big action piece in the middle of the film where the villain employs a military-grade drone to escape a convoy on a bridge. Honestly, my favorite sequence in the film isn't one of the grand battles but the infiltration of the Vatican when the IMF team realizes they have a chance at acquiring Davian. It's not bombastic; it's more of the cooler spy stuff I loved about the first film. I always find I love these movies more when their treated as a spy film with action elements, rather than an action film with spy elements. I love that we get to see more in M:I:III about how the IMF works behind the scenes. We spend some time in IMF headquarters and there's the question of a possible mole working in the highest rankings of the organization (which, you'll remember, was also a big part of the first film). MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III brings the series back to the elements that I loved in the first movie while giving it a little more humanity and personal stakes. It was a fun improvement over John Woo's installment and almost as good as the original Brian De Palma film. A few years after this movie came out, it wouldn't matter as much anyway because Brad Bird would give us GHOST PROTOCOL, what I believe to be the best of the series and the one that blew all of the original three out of the water.",7,1,1,23 January 2016
Requiem for a Dream," A Powerhouse Drama about Addiction
","Man, this movie is intense. I was introduced to the work of director Darren Aronofsky when I was in college. I'd never heard of him or his movies, but I had a friend that would rave about how excellent he was. Once I finally got around to checking out REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, my mind was blown. I couldn't even smoke a cigarette for the first three hours after the movie had ended. With this one movie, I was convinced that Aronofsky was a director to keep tabs on because this is a man who knows how to get under an audience's skin. The movie based on a novel from Hubert Selby, Jr. It follows four people caught in the throes of addiction: Harry Goldfarb (Leto), his mother Sara (Burstyn), his girlfriend Marion (Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone (Wayans). Each of them has their drug of choice, and each of them experiences the highs before the true danger behind the choices they've made becomes a reality. Harry and Tyrone are heroin junkies, content with pawning Sara's TV for a fix. Marion is a girl from a comfortable background with dreams of designing her own clothing and a love for cocaine. And Sara withers away in miserable retirement until she's presented with an opportunity to appear on her favorite infomercial/game show and her desperation to get in shape for her big appearance leads to a debilitating speed habit. This is not a movie about overcoming these obstacles, it's about the horrors of addiction.Fair warning to those who haven't seen this movie: it can be a little rough for the feint of heart. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM combines a powerful story with amazing performances, a killer soundtrack from Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet, and hyperkinetic editing that will get your own heart rate jacked. Thanks to Aronofsky's talented vision, the audience experiences the highs and lows of these characters and will have you wincing in pain along with them. The final act of the movie, when everything goes full tilt, is intense. It pulls no punches in depicting where addiction can lead. This would be the perfect anti-drug PSA because, as is usually the case in real life, addiction wins. It's not something that be shrugged off or sugar- coated and Aronofsky (and Selby) shoves your face in it with horrifying depictions of the consequences. You watch as these characters desperately try to rationalize what they're doing, finding excuses to justify their actions. Each of them has their hopes and dreams Harry and Marion want to open a boutique to sell her clothing designs, Tyrone wants to honor his mother's memory with his own personal success, and Sara just wants someone to care about her. Unfortunately, their habits (and, in one case, an apathetic health care system) win them over, slowly destroying them until the final gripping montage shatters any remaining hope for them. I can't stress enough how powerful this movie is and, love it or hate it, everyone should watch it at least once.Now, a movie about addiction won't work unless you care about the characters and that's another aspect where this movie excels. I want to know how in the world Ellen Burstyn lost the Academy Award for Best Actress to Julia Roberts (for ERIN BROKOVICH, where she flashes her cleavage and pretends to be a lawyer). Burstyn is amazing in REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, more than any other performance in the film. She is a tortured soul and I don't know about anyone else but I felt more for her than any other character. She's retired, widowed, and just wants someone to pay attention to her. Naïve, she doesn't even appear to know or understand that her one and only son is a junkie. She does what she has to do for him, even if it means a weekly trip to the pawn shop to retrieve her TV. When she is given a chance to appear on TV, she's just so desperate to lose the weight and you hate to watch her begin the slippery slope of pill addiction. Jared Leto and Jennifer Connelly do a fantastic job as well, and even Marlon Wayans is commendable here. I want to know how Wayans can prove he has some serious acting chops here, and then throw them away to continue making movies like WHITE CHICKS. Depressing as it may be, I absolutely love this movie. A real movie is more than just spectacle, it's substance and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM has it in spades. It will leave you unnerved.",9,0,1,31 July 2012
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Weak beginning to a great saga...
","I admit, I loved this movie when I first saw it in theaters. Walking out of the theater, I was dumbfounded. I think I was just getting over the shell-shock of seeing the newest movie in a series I have loved since childhood. The lightsaber duels are awesome. The starships are sleek and graceful. CGI creatures populating a giant, new galaxy.Since then, I have noticed that the movie seems to be just that: all style and no substance. The movie does have a plot, just not much of one. The planet of Naboo is under siege by the Trade Federation and the Jedi Council sends Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to sort things out. I once read a review for the movie which called it 'two hours of trade negotiations', which isn't far from the truth, I guess.My biggest problem with the movie was the acting. Most of the cast gave wooden, emotionless performances, though there were a few exceptions. Natalie Portman, when not decked out in Queenly-gear, seemed almost human. Ray Park, who plays Sith apprentice Darth Maul, is probably my favorite cast member. His job is merely to look menacing and whoop ass, and he does both well. Jake Lloyd was at the opposite end of this spectrum. I personally think he did a terrible job as Anakin Skywalker. It confuses me to think that George Lucas had the opportunity to cast Haley Joel Osment and passed it up. Of course, it is obligational that I mention my contempt for the character of Jar Jar Binks. Binks, and the Gungan race in general, shows how Lucas was trying to appeal to the younger crowds to beef up merchandise sales. I was a little annoyed with the excessive toilet jokes, which I didn't think fit for a 'Star Wars' movie.Despite all this, I still enjoy this movie to an extent. The special effects are great and the fight scene choreography is extraordinary. Plus knowing that you are one step further towards the arrival of Darth Vader helps make the movie worth a viewing.",7,0,1,7 May 2005
Sucker Punch," It Should've Just Been a Video Game
","Zack Snyder has never given me reason to doubt him. He's created some of the coolest movies in recent years and, with SUCKER PUNCH, he's finally gotten around to creating a wholly original (though obviously heavily influenced) film. It's a fast-paced, sexy action collage with a paper-thin plot tying it all together. After the accidental murder of her younger sister, a young girl (known only as Baby Doll) is committed to a mental asylum by her corrupt father in an attempt to keep her silent as he steals her inheritance. The father forms a deal with a shady orderly to organize a lobotomy in mere days that will ensure Baby Doll is no longer a threat. In the asylum, Baby Doll begins to imagine the place as an elaborate brothel run by the abusive Blue Jones. Baby Doll falls in with a group of orphans and runaways (Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, & Blondie) and formulates a plan to escape using her hypnotic dance to distract while her friends gather the supplies they need. Baby Doll dives into fantastic imaginary worlds where she and her team battle evil forces in a desperate attempt to escape their imprisonment.It really is a strange story, with fantasy worlds inside fantasy worlds. Unfortunately, the story itself is the movie's weak point. Snyder has proved in the past that he's an incredible visual storyteller with a unique style and he proves it yet again here with amazing fantasy sequences where Baby Doll and her team are thrown into incredible sequences battling a fire-breathing dragon, steam-powered zombie Nazis, and more. The action in this film is spectacular with vivid worlds and adrenaline-soaked battles and plenty of Snyder's beloved slow-motion. When I watch this movie, I can't help but feel like I should be holding a controller. This movie is more of a feature-length video game than a proper narrative film. In a way, it's even divided into individual stages, each with its own objective and the brothel scenes playing out like narrative cut scenes. The fantasy/action sequences are boosted with some killer music setting the mood, including star Emily Browning's haunting vocals in a version of the Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)' and a wicked cover of Jefferson Airplane's 'White Rabbit'. The soundtrack in this movie is definitely one of the best this year.Well, action's not necessarily enough to carry a film on it's own so SUCKER PUNCH has the added bonus of mind-blowing sex appeal. Emily Browning is gorgeous as a the blond Baby Doll, often sporting a school girl outfit in her fantasies as she's taking on stone samurai or slicing through a horde of orcs. Whenever she's on screen, she's impossible to take your eyes off of. Her team is rounded out by the beautiful Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Jamie Chung, and Vanessa Hudgens (all grown up from her Disney Channel days, apparently). Carla Gugino has a supporting role sporting a Polish accent as Dr. Gorski, the voice of compassion in an otherwise dreary life for these girls. Oscar Isaac is the film villain, Blue Jones. I've never heard of Isaac before now but he does well as the volatile...pimp? I suppose you could call him that. Regardless, he makes a cool villain for the piece. There's plenty of awesome characters here, but they don't matter as much here as the gunfights and swordplay. It's a shame, too. I wanted Syder's first original piece to stand out as much as his previous films, but the fact that he sacrificed an intriguing story and strong characters for women in skimpy outfits flying mechs and firing huge guns turned a lot of people (both critics and audiences) off. Wait, women in skimpy outfits...massive guns...what was the problem again?",7,0,1,15 August 2011
10 Cloverfield Lane," The 'Blood Relative' to 2008's CLOVERFIELD is a Surprisingly Effective Thriller
","In a world of unnecessary sequels to movies that no one asked for, J.J. Abrams and director Dan Trachtenberg snuck in under the radar to show us how to do it right. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE came out of nowhere and blew everyone away, scoring highly with critics and audiences. I have to imagine the fact that this movie was barely publicized until it was ready to drop really gave it a boost. I seriously doubt anyone was walking around prior to its release saying, 'You know what movie really needs a sequel? That 'found footage' POV monster movie from 2008.' I know I never would've considered it, and I was a fan of that movie. Meanwhile, forces behind the scenes were crafting a new installment that, really, isn't so much a sequel as perhaps instead another tale in some sort of CLOVERFIELD anthology series. Aside from the title (in this case, referring to an actual street in the film) and the usual reference to Slusho you find in any J.J. Abrams project, there is nothing to connect 10 CLOVERFIELD LAND to its predecessor. The fact that Abrams and Paramount didn't come out and announce production on a CLOVERFIELD film meant that there would be no hype machine to start placing potentially unreasonable expectations on the film that might lead to audience disappointment. They were able to create the film they wanted to create without the movie news media breathing down their backs for spoilers and drop it in our laps.The love for 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is certainly warranted. Just as the first film told a science fiction story from an unusual perspective, this one dips its toe in that same format by placing the audience in the middle of some doomsday apocalyptic scenario from the cozy confines of an underground bunker. Or is it? That is the crux of the majority of the film that focuses on Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an aspiring fashion designer who's just run out on her fiancé. As she's driving through Louisiana to put some distance between her and her ex, she's involved in a horrible car accident and awakens in the underground survival bunker of Howard (John Goodman). She's rightfully terrified at first of Howard's intentions but he proceeds to explain that there's been an attack on the United States. Some sort of biological weapon had been utilized that's made the surface unlivable and, gee, wasn't it just great luck on her part that Howard found her, brought her to the bunker, and nursed her back to health from her injuries? The only other survivor in the bunker with them is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who had helped Howard build the bunker, and he only knows what Howard's told him about the mysterious events that've led them here. It's a lot for Michelle take in and it's made a little harder to accept due to Howard's increasingly bizarre, menacing behavior. Was there really an attack? Or are these two prisoners?About 80% of this movie plays out in the one location and that could mean disaster for some movies, but 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE makes it work with some top notch production design and cinematography to make the most of the limited space, and with fantastic performances from Winstead and Goodman. Winstead does a fantastic job as the film's hero but Goodman steals the show. His performance here is one of the best he's ever done. Howard is a complex character whose intentions we can only guess at for a while before they become crystal clear, and Goodman plays it so perfectly that, even having watched this movie twice now, I still can't stop being drawn in to his character. He comes across as an awkward, lonely man who is incredibly proud of himself for having been prepared for this scenario and, seeing as how he's saved the lives of these two young folk, expects them to live by his very strict rules. But there's always that nagging doubt that something isn't right with him and, just when you think you've got him pegged as a con artist, the movie reveals some nugget of truth behind what he's told them. It keeps you guessing as to whether something disastrous has really occurred on the surface and Howard is just a bit of a creep, or whether the 'attack' is all a lie to keep Michelle and Emmett as willing prisoners to a dangerous psychopath in this man's isolated underground concrete prison.All of that is amazing. Everything in the bunker is just great and I would've been fine if the movie ended when that was all resolved, but there's still another twenty minutes or so after that where everything goes a little nuts. For me, the story was all about Michelle and Howard and the science fiction stuff was just added spice to an excellent story. We didn't need a whole section with just the spice. You ever eat a spoonful of turmeric? It's unpleasant. And that heaping spoonful of sci-fi craziness at the end of 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE sours it a bit. But don't let that concern you (assuming you're reading this before having watched it) because it's not enough to ruin the overall fun of this surprise unnecessary (but very welcome) 'sequel'.",8,0,0,10 May 2017
The Expendables 2," Old School '80s Heroes with Weak Contemporary Action
","By some miracle, THE EXPENDABLES 2 is neither better nor worse than the first movie. I wasn't a huge fan of the original movie but I appreciated what they were trying to accomplish with it. Sylvester Stallone gathered together some of the biggest names in action into one movie and tried to bring back the feel of the classic '80s action movie. The movie had a lot of problems but was just dumb enough to be a good bit of fun. The second movie is more of the same with bigger names in the cast and larger set pieces. The filmmakers have made no effort to improve on the problems of the first movie and, if they had, I think this movie could've been one of the best action movies of the decade. To be honest, if they hadn't brought in more big name action stars to round out the team, I probably wouldn't have been interested enough to give THE EXPENDABLES 2 a chance. With Stallone stepping down from directing duties and handing them over to Simon West, I had renewed interest. After all, the man directed CON AIR. But then again, he also directed TOMB RAIDER. The movie joins the Expendables team as they are completing a mission in Nepal and we are introduced to their newest member, a sniper named Billy the Kid. Team leader Barney Ross (Stallone) is soon approached by CIA operative Church (Willis) about leading a mission into Albania to recover the contents of a safe from a plane crash site. The mission should be simple: lead Church's agent, a woman named Maggie Chan, to the site, recover the goods, and bring it home. The mission falls apart when the goods are stolen by terrorist Jean Villain (Van Damme) and a team member is killed. Now Ross and his team must find Villain to end his evil plans and avenge their teammate.You can tell from the character names that the writing hasn't improved since the last film. I mean, come on, the bad guy's name is Villain. Villain. Get it? Yeah, I guess it fits right in with other characters like Toll Road and Hale Caesar. The writing in the movie is on par with a high school freshman penning their ideal action movie, complete with cheesy dialogue and groan-inducing one-liners. No offense to Stallone, who wrote the screenplay with Richard Wenk. The man knows action, but his writing leaves a lot to be desired. The tough guy dialogue sounds corny and the emotional moments are forced. For example, there's a quiet moment on the Expendables' plane when we get a bit of Billy the Kid's back-story. He's ex- military and he spills his sad tale of watching all his colleagues die in an ambush; then, to drive the point home, he survives and returns to base to findgasp!...they'd shot the stray dog he'd adopted. All right, we get it. Billy's the innocent one. He's still got a bit of a soul and a life of violence hasn't hardened his heart yet. I'm sure nothing bad will happen to a character like that in a movie like this. On the topic of dialogue, you can't discuss THE EXPENDABLES 2 without mentioning the ridiculous level of self-referential humor in the movie. Stallone does not want you to forget that these guys are famous action stars and his script does its best to remind you every chance it gets. References to TERMINATOR, DIE HARD, and even the Chuck Norris facts meme from the Internet are included as an ongoing wink and nod to the audience. One or twice, OK. Constant stream of references in the middle of the big end battle? Sort of annoying.Right, so the movie fails to improve on the writing of the first movie. How about the action? Well, it's still a bunch of CG bullet hits, blood spatter, gunfire, and explosions. You want to recapture the fun of big '80s action? Blood squibs and gasoline bombs are the way to go. Not all this digital stuff. It stands out like a sore thumb. The best action movies are gritty, real, and violent. Not video games. I also wish Stallone would put his characters in danger a little more. Don't make them feel so invincible. It takes some of the fun out of it when we come to the realization that no one's going to get hurt; all the heroes will survive and live to ride off into the sunset in the end. Ross is shot twice in a scene and walks it off. Sure, he was wearing Kevlar armor but you need to make us believe that these guys are one good shot away from a body bag. Put them in danger! You've got a big team theresacrifice one near the end to remind us these guys are mortals. Otherwise there's no risk! I don't know, these are just my thoughts on what might make the EXPENDABLES a more thrilling action movie.THE EXPENDABLES 2 is just the same as the first movie. Dumb. Big, dumb action. This one is cool enough to add heavy hitters Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, and Jean-Claude Van Damme into the mix. I loved that. Van Damme was an awesome villain (or should I sayVillain?). He was way more threatening than Eric Roberts and Steve Austin in the first movie. It was great seeing all of these action legends on screen at the same time, fighting side by side. If it had been handled better, THE EXPENDABLES 2 could've been a legend all its own.",7,1,1,29 January 2013
Source Code," An Exciting Thriller with Bits of Science Fiction
","We need more filmmakers like Duncan Jones with a passion for great science fiction. His first film, MOON in 2009, was one of the best in years and his second while his second, SOURCE CODE, isn't as thought-provoking, it's still better than the majority of recent science fiction. SOURCE CODE feels a bit more mainstream than MOON, but it still focuses on an interesting story without relying on action to keep the viewer engaged. Captain Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a helicopter pilot for the US military who unknowingly becomes a part of an experimental program called Source Code. He awakens on a Chicago commuter train with no memory of how he arrived, and he soon discovers that he's inhabiting the body and mind of a school teacher. Eight minutes later, the train explodes and Stevens is informed of his mission. The train had exploded in Chicago earlier that morning as a warning of future attacks to come and Stevens has been given the chance to relive the final eight minutes leading up to the attack and discover the identity of the bomber before he can strike again. Still, his commanding officers are being sketchy with the details of the project and Stevens begins to suspect there's something they're not telling him...Modern science fiction in the mainstream is pretty much limited to comic book movies and big-budget blockbuster fare (e.g. Abrams' STAR TREK reboot or Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS series). Every so often, a shining gem emerges that reminds us that science fiction was once a great genre used as a means of getting the audience contemplating mankind's flaws and where they might lead us. In recent years, DISTRICT 9 reminded us of the horrors of apartheid and applied them to our first contact with an alien species. Jones' own MOON contemplated how human rights might (or might not) apply to clones. SOURCE CODE doesn't focus as much on big questions, though it does pose the moral question as to whether it was all right to force one man's constant suffering/repeated death if it means saving millions more. The movie does touch on Stevens' predicament and whether the program is justifiable but it focuses more on the mystery element as Stevens is given multiple chances to try and identify the train bomber. You would think watching him relive the same eight minutes over and over again would become dull, but Jones and writer Ben Ripley keep it fresh each time with new information and new strategies.Jones is displaying a knack for great casting. Gyllenhaal does an excellent job here as Stevens. He's confused, frightened, and dropped into the middle of a situation where he has no control. He skillfully relates with the audience, and it was the little things that hit me as his best moments. I loved his reaction to the news of his fate from the last mission he remember in Afghanistan. Little bits like that and his dedication to saving a woman he's been repeatedly reminded already died. Michelle Monaghan is adorable as Stevens' only 'friend' on the train and growing love interest, and Vera Farmiga was a great choice as his military point-of-contact Goodwin. Honestly, I envy Stevens in a sense. Who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their lives with Farmiga's beautiful face staring down. Jeffrey Wright is the project's creator and an antagonist in his own way, valuing his project over Stevens life and rights.It doesn't feel as rich in content as MOON, but SOURCE CODE is still a strong second film for director Duncan Jones. It's enough to place him among the new era of emerging directors that I'm excited to see what they do next.",8,1,2,5 September 2011
Skyfall," A Triumphant Return for 007
","As I see it, we were incredibly lucky to receive the twenty-third Bond movie, SKYFALL. There were a lot of problems with MGM, the studio that owned the franchise and brought us each of the twenty-two previous entries, and for a while it looked like the franchise might be dead in the water. As a major fan of the series, this was an incredibly depressing possibility for me. So the eventual announcement that Bond was on his way back to the big screen and he was being directed by an Oscar-caliber filmmaker was an exciting time. The final product was lauded by critics and audiences (with a final score of 92% on Rotten Tomatoes) and I couldn't agree more with all the praise. Personally, I loved it as a triumphant return after a five-year hiatus and a perfect blend of the modern 007 that Daniel Craig has come to embody with loving homages to the classic 007 we've loved. SKYFALL is one of the rare 007 movies where the mission is a more personal venture for our hero. The villain doesn't have grand schemes of world domination or financial gain. Instead, the mana former MI6 agenthas a more personal agenda and targets M (Dame Judi Dench) in a series of terrorist attacks meant to discredit her. But he has no intention of stopping there. Meanwhile, James Bond has been MIA since a mission went awry and is forced to return to service when MI6 is publicly targeted in an explosive attack.Just about every quibble I have with SKYFALL is minor. This movie is fantastic and there are no major issues that ruin the experience for me in any sense. I do agree that the movie does run a bit too long. Well, that's not necessarily true because I've sat through longer movies without a problem. I guess it's more that you can feel the run-time in SKYFALL at some moments, especially in the final act. The final act, a massive on-going action set-piece and a glimpse into the James Bond's past, drags on a little. It's explosive and exciting at the start, but the energy sort of peters out by the end and leaves the final confrontation with the villain a little anticlimactic. My only other complaint, and it's more out of selfishness than anything else, is I would have loved more time with the villain. Javier Bardem is the film's antagonist, an MI6 agent who goes by the pseudonym Raoul Silva who maintains a grudge after having been abandoned to suffer in the hands of an enemy nation. While just about all of the Bond villains in the past have obviously had some sort of screw loose, Silva comes across as full- blown psychotic. He's calm, calculating, and not averse to sacrificing lives to get his point across and accomplish his goals. Silva has jumped through the ranks to become one of my favorite all-time 007 villains, and I wish we'd gotten some more time with him. He doesn't arrive until around 45 minutes in the film, and I'm cool with that. Let the suspense build and give him a cool reveal late in the gameI'm down for that and Mendes pulled it off perfectly. But then he disappears again after some fantastic action sequences and we don't see him until the end. It feels like a wasted opportunity, but I suppose too much of a good thing would've ruined the effect.SKYFALL shows some love for the fans who made James Bond so long lasting and popular with plenty of loving references to classic 007. The Aston Martin (from GOLDFINGER) makes a return after a nearly twenty year absence; I believe the last time we saw Bond in an Aston Martin (though not necessarily THE Aston Martin) was the beginning of GOLDENEYE in 1995. We also get our first introduction to Q since the series was rebooted in 2006. Ben Wishaw is a little younger that we're accustomed to in our Quartermaster and it's too soon to tell if he'll successfully fill the shoes of the late Desmond Llewellyn, but he brings confidence and a more modern tech edge to the character. No bizarre gadgets here, just a Walther with palm print identification. The rest of the MI6 staff is filled out in SKYFALL but I won't go into details here to avoid some pretty major spoilers. Newcomers to the series include Naomie Harris as Eve, a relatively new field agent, and Ralph Fiennes as Gareth Mallory, a bureaucrat who is brought in to investigate M when MI6's mission in the opening sequence falls apart.True fans of the 007 franchise should find plenty to love here. I was excited to find that the story was presented on a much smaller scale (personal revenge as opposed to some grander scheme) but giving us the exotic locales and beautiful women we expect from the series. SKYFALL is a nice blend of the more serious, action-oriented new Bond with a taste of the classic, and the ending left me excited for the inevitable next film in the series.",9,3,9,25 May 2013
Catch Me If You Can," Fun Movie with Great Cast
","You can't really go wrong with a film from Steven Spielberg. I can't really think of a bad film the man has ever made, so you know to expect quality when you watch his movies; this 2002 Christmas release is no different. Inspired by a true story, the film follows the story of Frank Abagnale Jr., one of the greatest con artists the United States has ever seen. Abagnale had posed as an airline pilot, doctor, and lawyer before he turned 21, cashing more than $2 million in fraudulent checks.Jeff Nathanson based the screenplay on the book of the same name, written by Abagnale himself. The story covers so much and moves so fast, yet it never loses the audience or stumbles over itself. In the capable hands of Spielberg, the movie drives on at a good pace and keeps the audience interested throughout. In the end, it's the character of Abagnale that makes the movie so entertaining. At the time, I hadn't cared a whole lot for Leonardo DiCaprio in the past but this movie changed that a bit. DiCaprio was a fan of Abagnale's book before the film ever came about, so his passion for the material shines through his performance. He also had great chemistry with Tom Hanks, who plays the FBI agent on his trail. We also get a strong supporting performance from Christopher Walken as Frank's father; despite his minimal screen time, it was enough to make an impression (and win some awards).Knowing Spielberg spares no expense, you can also expect great production design. With the film set in the 1960's, it made for some colorful scenery. The movie does run a bit long (a little over two hours) but it isn't painful. It's a fun movie and Spielberg doesn't let you down; all I can do is recommend you check it out.",8,2,3,4 February 2009
The Hangover," The Must-See Comedy of Summer 2009
","Let me start by saying that this film was the absolute funniest movie of 2009. Director Todd Phillips has created comedic gold in this buddy comedy about a bachelor party in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong when the groom goes missing; now, his three friends must piece together what happened over a night none of them remember to locate him in time for his approaching wedding. Similar to DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR but in a more adult vein, it's hilarious to watch the events unfold as the guys find out just how insane their missing night was. I'd been excited to see this movie when it came to theaters, having heard all the hype building behind it and it lived up to all I'd read.The cast was phenomenal in this movie. The three main characters (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) were hilarious, especially the character of Alan (Galifianakis). Future brother-in-law Alan was the requisite outcast character who's slow-witted nature never seems to fit with the cool Phil (Cooper) or the high-strung Stu (Helms). Supporting the main trio are a slew of cameos as the guys retrace their steps to find the truth. Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, and Mike Epps pop in for a few laughs and even Mike Tyson has a few scenes where he's surprisingly funny.There isn't too much I can say about the film without risking dropping spoilers, as the film is just as much a mystery as it is a comedy. The film ranks as one of the funniest raunchy buddy comedies I've seen and was a much appreciated surprise when I caught in in theaters. It's an intelligent comedy with the perfect level of immaturity and some great performances, which should be enough to entertain anyone. Check it out and be sure to sit through the first half of the end credits where they show photos from the missing camera and shed some more light on the most insane bachelor party.",9,1,3,16 December 2009
Iron Man 3," One of the Best Marvel Films and a Perfect Start to Phase II
","There was no movie in 2013 that brought down the wrath its rabid fan base worse than IRON MAN 3. This is because there is an outspoken demographic, albeit a seemingly small one, who are purists that can't abide changes to the source material and IRON MAN 3 takes some pretty drastic liberties with a classic comic villain. I am not one of these purists and I'm happy to say that IRON MAN 3 was both one of the best movies of the summer and one of the best Marvel Studios films so far. We've got a new director (Shane Black) and a different perspective on the popular character in which we examine Tony Stark and his personal demons as opposed to merely pitting him against another armored baddie. The movie is established after the events of THE AVENGERS with Stark suffering anxiety attacks and insomnia from the mental and emotional strain he suffered during the Chitauri invasion. He's been busy in his workshop to keep his mind off it, and his relationship with Pepper Potts has suffered. A ghost from Stark's past soon reemerges in the form of Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), a fellow scientist and the founder of A.I.M., who hopes to form a partnership with Stark Industries in his research into enhancement nanotechnology and, meanwhile, a terrorist known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) has started a campaign of terror against the United States that becomes personal when a close friend of Stark's is caught in the crossfire.The more complaints I read about this movie, the more I realize I enjoyed it for those very same reasons. Tony Stark spends a comparatively shorter amount of time in the Iron Man armor as opposed to the previous films in the franchise. You know what? Cool. I'm down with that. I don't want my comic films to be just people in costume punching other people in costume. Stark spent loads of time in the armor in IRON MAN 2 and it didn't save that movie from all its problems. IRON MAN 3 dives into the character of Tony Stark and the fact that he's having a difficult time adapting to all of these new revelations: the existence of aliens, the arrival of the Asgardians, and particularly the fact that he's a superhero. He's begun having doubts that, without his armor, he is nothing and incapable of protecting those he cares about from harm. He's forced to uses his wits and intelligence to defeat his enemies here (well, except the final battle) and it's cool to see him as more than a flying blaster cannon. In THE AVENGERS, Steve Rogers asks Stark what he'd be if you didn't have the suit and he proves in this film that, suit or no suit, he's still Iron Man. Just because he doesn't suit up as often doesn't mean we don't get the action. There are plenty of cool battle sequences, my favorite being an escape from a Miami estate where Stark's only got a gauntlet and boot from the armor. As a summer action movie, IRON MAN 3 delivers.Being a comic film, another important element is having a good villain. Here is where the purist rage reaches epic levels. There is a pretty major reveal midway through the movie that I won't detail here (although it's probably been spoiled in countless other places) but the Mandarin sees some major changes from his comic counterpart. Personally, I'm cool with it. There are two primary villains at play in this movie: Ben Kinsley's Mandarin and Guy Pearce's Killian. Kingsley's Mandarin is fantastic. He's mostly shown in terrorist videos broadcast over hijacked airwaves and his performance is perfect. The same can be said for Killian. I love Guy Pearce as an actor and he's great as the film's madman mastermind. I can't go into too much detail without giving away important plot points but know that the villains in IRON MAN 3 are the best in the franchise. The third film of the series boasts a better cast that most other comic films and some talented new blood filling in for Jon Favreau as he steps down from the helm (though he returns as Happy Hogan). The movie's got an entirely new vibe that sets it apart from the previous movies and I can't stress how important it is to keep these series fresh. In a time when we're quickly becoming over-saturated in comic films and superheroes, it's an absolute necessity to give us fresh views and engaging new stories that won't rely on the same old tropes.As these Marvel movies continue, people need to remember that these films are set in an entirely different universe from the comics and they need to appeal to a broader audience. So things aren't always going to be the same and if characters or plot points need to be modified to fit the filmmakers' vision, you just need to learn to roll with it (as long as the final vision makes for great entertainment which, in my opinion, IRON MAN 3 absolutely is). This is an excellent action movie with the humor and fun we expect from the Iron Man series and a villain who amounts to more than another man in a powered suit. Shane Black's brought some fresh blood to a series I'd worried might be losing steam and he reinvigorated it, giving Marvel's Phase II a perfect start.",9,17,27,7 December 2013
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," My Biggest Disappointment in Summer 2012
","I received Seth Grahame-Smith's novel for Christmas in 2011 and loved it. It perfectly blended the events of Lincoln's life with a new life as a vampire hunter in such a way that you could almost buy it as legit (if you have a loose grip on reality). It was portrayed as a secret journal Lincoln kept from his youth in which he documents the events of his life and how he came to be a vampire hunter and why it led to his interest in freeing the slaves in the Civil War. I was excited to find out, shortly after I finished the novel, that it was on the fast track to a movie adaptation from producer Tim Burton and director Timur Bekmambetov (WANTED). It was a perfect combo for the source material! The book was dark, suspenseful, and a gripping read. Well, the movie was none of these things. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER was turned into summer blockbuster schlock with mindless action and a modified plot that ruined or removed all the best parts of the novel. For those unfamiliar, everything you need to know about this movie is in the title. It's the story of Abraham Lincoln's secret life. Our country's beloved 16th president is famous for his Emancipation Proclamation but spent his free time hunting the undead. When a vampire murders his mother, Lincoln dedicates his life to avenging her and battling the undead threat. Under the tutelage of the mysterious Henry Sturges, Lincoln develops the skills necessary to engage his new enemies.What bothers me most about the Burton/Bekmambetov adaption is how much it seems to veer away from the vibe of the novel. I understand that the script for the movie was written by Grahame-Smith (the original author) but even he seemed almost apologetic when I listened to his commentary for the film. In my opinion, he appeared to spend the entire movie trying to justify all the changes he made. No dice, Grahame-Smith. The changes were unnecessary and seem like pandering to the summer movie crowd in hopes of big box office cash. In a sense, he was successful because the movie made more than it's budget back in returns but it doesn't kill my disappointment. The action in the novel was brutal and fit the darker mood; the action in the movie is embellished and crazy with Lincoln running across the backs of stampeding horses or battling vampires on the roof of a speeding train. The writing and characters tried to take the material seriously (just as I'd hoped) but the events were so extreme that it bordered on campy. And what was the deal with Lincoln's almost supernatural abilities. There is nothing of the sort in the novel; Lincoln is just a normal man who trains his body and mind into peak condition. I know that's a lot to portray in a movie. That's what montages are for. We don't need to see Lincoln chopping a tree in half with a single swing. That's just stupid. I was hoping the movie would approach the premise and treat it as a 'what if this were true' scenario and not as a semi-superhero tale.I also didn't see the point in adding the additional characters. There was a lot to get across in this movie already without tossing in new characters to develop. I went in to the movie understanding that the movie would need to leave a lot out. The novel covers the majority of Lincoln's lifeway more than could fit into a movie running under two hours long. But don't waste time with new material when the original was great. Instead, we get Lincoln's best friend Will Johnson (Anthony Mackie), a freed slave, and vampire lord Adam (Rufus Sewell). I guess Johnson was tossed in so the audience would have an easy understanding of what led Lincoln to free the slaves and Adam was supposed to be a focus point for all the vampire villainy. In other words, over-simplifying everything for a movie audience. The novel worked perfectly without these characters dumbing things down. The novel had a more overwhelming vampire conspiracy threat with their agents everywhere while Adam merely sneers and hams for the camera. He's your generic action movie villain. But he's the big baddie and gives Lincoln someone to kill during a climactic final battle and that's what summer movies need, I suppose.Anyway, fans of the novel are bound to be as disappointed in the movie as I was. Benjamin Walker was inspired casting as Lincoln. He was the smartest choice the filmmakers made. Mary Elizabeth Winstead didn't fit her role as Mary Todd. She's too adorable to be believable in the role, and the old age effects didn't work for her in the later parts of the film. Dominic Cooper has been scoring some major points as a rising star but I don't like his 'rock star' version of Henry Sturges. I guess this was more a fault of the script, but I preferred the stoic mentor I remember from the novel. As far as its position as a summer movie, it's a stylish passable bit of entertainment. I was just hoping it'd have been a lot more.",6,0,2,20 January 2013
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," An 80's Classic & Robert Zemeckis' Best
","No doubt, this movie is a classic. Honestly, who hasn't seen this movie? As I see it, this film ranks up there with GHOST BUSTERS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, and the INDIANA JONES (original) trilogy as one of the most memorable films of the '80s. It's entertaining for both kids and adults, equal parts loony and suspenseful. Based on a mystery novel by Gary K. Wolf (which I'm now reminded I really want to read), the film is set in a world where cartoons and real life coexists side-by-side, also known as every kid's dream. Cartoon characters inhabit a colorful world known as Toontown that somehow exists next to Los Angeles (awfully convenient, really). The movie is a wacky adventure mixed with film noir set in the late 1940s. Private detective Eddie Valiant is hired to trail the wife of famed cartoon star Roger Rabbit and prove that she's having an affair with cartoon gadget mogul Marvin Acme. Roger doesn't respond to the news well and, when Marvin Acme turns up dead, Roger's the number one suspect. Roger pleads with Valiant, a toon-hater since the day one dropped a piano on his brother's head, to help clear his name and protect him from the brooding Judge Doom. Doom has developed a chemical mixture known as 'dip' and it's the only real means of killing a toon, which he appears to do with great pleasure. Valiant is the one man who can clear Roger's name, find Acme's true killer, and unravel a conspiracy that may result in the end of Toontown.If you've somehow gone this long without seeing this movie, there's something wrong with you and you need to remedy it as soon as possible. It doesn't matter how old a person is, there's something here for everyone. For example, it's the only time we've been able to see the world's most beloved cartoon characters from all major studios come together in the same film: Mickey Mouse skydiving with Bugs Bunny, Donald and Daffy Duck in a piano battle, etc. It's enough to blow a kid's mind and nostalgic enough that anyone who grew up on these cartoons will get a kick out of it. That's not to say the movie is all cartoon zaniness. I'll be honest and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can say that Judge Doom scared the ever-loving crap out of me when I was younger. Christopher Lloyd is down-right creepy as the film's antagonist, dressed all in black with an evil deliberate feel to every move he makes. The scene in the Acme Warehouse where he demonstrates the effectiveness of his dip on a cartoon shoe is pretty messed up when you think about it. He dips the shoe into the toxic mixture and when he pulls his gloved hand out of the barrel, it's covered in goopy red ink/paint to really drive home the point that he just killed the toon. And don't get me started on the final act where Valiant confronts the villain. I'll spare excessive details for the uninitiated, but I was four-years-old when the movie came and I still remember how terrified I was. I'm just saying.The characters in this movie have become iconic: Roger Rabbit, Baby Herman, and especially Jessica Rabbit (who's been widely recognized as the hottest cartoon creation ever, no doubt due in part to Kathleen Turner's vocal performance). They may never be as widely beloved as the classic characters (Mickey, Bugs, etc.) but they left their mark on my childhood just the same. Judge Doom is a crazy S.O.B. and ranks as one of my all-time favorite movie villains, and Bob Hoskins is a great sport for all the craziness as Eddie Valiant. The story is complex enough for an adult audience with some older humor sprinkled in for the 'grown-ups' to get a laugh and the kids get a zany ride in a world where cartoons are real. No offense to BACK TO THE FUTURE and it's massive fan base (of which I'm a part), but I think this film is Robert Zemeckis' best.",8,0,0,23 October 2011
Gravity," In a Word: Beautiful.
","I have two major cinematic regrets from 2013. The first is that I believed that A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD couldn't possibly be as bad as the reviews were claiming. I was wrong to trust that the series might regain it's footing. Thanks, Bruce Willis. Now I have trust issues. My second regret is that I foolishly failed to catch GRAVITY in theaters. This movie is probably one of the most visually stunning films I've ever seen. The plot is fairly simple but the massively impressive production value more than compensates. Director Alfonso Cuarón has crafted a thrilling survival film set in the harshest environment humans (well, a select few anyway) have endured: space. It follows the tribulations of Dr. Ryan Stone. Stone is a mission specialist with NASA that has been sent into orbit to perform upgrades to the Hubble telescope in her first assignment. Disaster strikes on her first spacewalk when the Russians destroy one of their satellites and the debris cloud rockets around in orbit, detonating other satellites and creating a lethal wave of shredded metal careening around the Earth at 20,000 MPH. The space shuttle is destroyed and most of the crew is killed, leaving Stone and mission commander Matt Kowalski as the sole survivors left drifting above the Earth and counting the minutes until the debris' next deadly pass. Stone will need to face her fears if she hopes to survive as she and Kowalski must find a means of returning to Earth alive.I'm a space geek and have been for as long as I can remember. As much as I love science fiction, and I do quite a bit, there have been few films that have ever given much effort to portray space as it actually is. There's always some sort of convenient technology to prevent the filmmakers from having to deal with the harsh realities of space travel. GRAVITY isn't science fiction but is instead a survival drama set in the environment of space, and Cuarón uses the full gamut of hazards that come with leaving the Earth's atmosphere. There are no rocket boots to make maneuvering in space a simple task here. Well, there's a sort of jet pack unit used in limited capacity but the danger still remains that if Stone or Kowalski make one wrong move, they will find themselves slowly drifting off for a lonely, horrifying death as they wait for their air supply to run out. GRAVITY isn't 100% accurate to the trials and tribulations of surviving in space and some liberties were taken for the sake of telling a story, but it's so much more realistic than has been portrayed in pretty much any movie that's come before. Cuarón and his team have found a way of realistically portraying total weightlessness so well that I couldn't wait to watch the behind-the-scenes footage to find out how it was done. I loved that there were no sleek, fancy spaceships and we get legitimate recreations of existing space structures such as the International Space Station.And the visuals are just incredible. This is a movie that, for the utmost effect, should be viewed in IMAX 3D. I missed out and watched the movie in high definition when it was released on home video, but I saw enough (and was wowed enough) to know that I had missed out on something incredible. The Earth, as seen from orbit, is an amazing backdrop for a film and there was not a single moment of this film that I didn't find absolutely gorgeous. I realize I've spent most of this comment ranting about my love for the film's visuals but that's because it's the best reason to see this film. The story is very simple: Stone, eventually left to her own devices, must confront her fear of death and find a means of escaping her fate. It's primarily just Stone (Sandra Bullock) traversing from one hope to another as she goes from station to station searching for a functional escape capsule while dodging the debris/blender. I hate to undermine it because it's still an exciting story and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning. Stone is a sympathetic character and we learn bits about her as the story progresses and watch as she eventually buckles under the pressure of her situation. At this point, we know that Bullock is a talented actress and she does well in this movie where she's pretty much the entirety of the cast for most of the film. Cuarón and Bullock manipulate your emotions and keep you invested until the final frame, and it all combines with the director's amazing vision to create one of the coolest movies I've seen in a long time.",9,3,4,13 July 2014
Se7en," A Modern Crime Classic
","I think just about everyone who has seen ALIEN 3 can agree, it's pretty crappy. We should all be thankful that Hollywood had the foresight to realize that it's director David Fincher managed to show considerable talent and saved it from the ultimate train wreck it's long, problematic development meant it should have been. After throwing himself under the bus to complete ALIEN 3, Fincher was given the chance to prove what he was really capable of with SE7EN. The film is a modern classic and most people will agree. I love a good serial killer story, and SE7EN is right up there at the top of the list with the best of them. Thanks to it's gripping story, talented performances, and an ending that will go down as one of the most memorable, SE7EN is an excellent movie well-deserving of the long-term attention it's gotten and the status it helped to build for Fincher. In the film, Detective William Somerset is one week from his retirement and begins training his replacement, the younger and more naïve Detective David Mills. Mills is a hotshot with an impatient attitude, recently transferred from a small town to the big city where he hopes to make a difference. Mills' first case, and Somerset's supposed final, turns into something larger than your average homicide. A new serial killer has come to light and he is using torture and murder to preach against the seven deadly sins to his victims (e.g. an obese man is forced to eat himself to death at gunpoint).This is a dark, twisted movie. From the very beginning we open with a warped credits sequence and a glimpse into the methods of the yet-unknown serial killer to the remixed sound of Nine Inch Nails' 'Closer'. And it only gets more twisted from there. We never actually see the murderer (with the inconspicuous name John Doe) in action as the audience. Instead, we see the aftermath as Somerset and Mills arrive on the scene and each crime scene is more brutal than the last. John Doe is a psychopath and uses his victims to preach his message in the worst way possible. SE7EN is the most gripping serial killer/thriller since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and even now, almost twenty years since it's release, is just as powerful as always. While there may not be any brutal violence occurring on screen, I would still recommend discretion for audience members who don't care for the darker subject matter. Despite the fact the movie was released in 1995, I'll try to remain spoiler-free when discussing the movie just in case, but the end of this movie has been parodied and paid homage countless times since. It's a strong ending and I'm glad it didn't cop out and go the usual route where the killer is stopped before his crimes can escalate and the story ends on a high note. Not here; it's a bittersweet ending where you could even go so far as to say the villain triumphs over the heroes.Every element of this movie contributes to its strength. The cinematography from Darius Khondji is amazing. The visual style of this movie is just as prominent as any performance. The high contrast, abundance of low lighting, overcast weather and sharp instances of source lighting (I really loved the red neon cross in Doe's apartment) gives this movie an overwhelming feeling of gloom that coincides with Detective Somerset's view on life in the city. I would love to get my hands on the screenplay from Andrew Kevin Walker for this one, as it's incredibly well written and was perfectly suited for the talents of someone as visually strong as director Fincher. The cast in this movie, again inspired. The only real important characters in the film are Somerset (Morgan Freeman), Mills (Brad Pitt), and the killer John Doe (who I won't spoil here on the off chance that someone reading this has not seen the movie and somehow avoided any and all revelations about Doe). Morgan Freeman is the kind of actor where you expect a powerful performance, and he delivers just that. Somerset is a jaded detective who's spent years on the force and seen it all (until Doe came along); he's tired and he's ready to find a simpler life. I've also got to give Pitt some great credit here because SE7EN was the movie that helped me realize Pitt was more talented than I'd believed and more than just a Hollywood pretty boy (further solidified in FIGHT CLUB, another awesome Fincher film). And finally, the actor portraying John Doe is excellent. Doe is a cold, calculating killer who truly believes in what he is doing and the actor gives one of the best eerie performances. All together, this all combines to create one of the best films of the 90s and almost guaranteed to become a favorite.",9,1,2,16 March 2012
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides...
","No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. At this point, I've easily seen it more than half a dozen times and I STILL find myself laughing throughout. This movie was my first exposure to the Coen brothers and it hooked me. Set in 1990's Los Angeles, the film follows the Dude, an unemployed stoner with a passion for bowling, as a case of mistaken identity and a soiled rug lead to his involvement in recovering a kid-napped woman. Honestly, that little synopsis doesn't do the film justice and it'd really be best to just watch it.The characters are what make this film so memorable. Jeff Bridges as the Dude, what can I say. Since seeing him in this movie, I haven't been able to picture him as anyone else (made it interesting seeing him as the villain in Jon Favreau's 'Iron Man', heh). He totally embodies this character, with his chilled demeanor and stoned investigating. Stealing the scene almost as often as the lead is John Goodman as the Dude's buddy, Walter. A Vietnam veteran who can't help but regress to 'Nam rants every time something grates on his nerves, Walter's attempts to help Dude in his predicament only make matters worse. These two characters alone (with, of course, credit to the fantastic writing of the Coens) fill the movie with infinitely quotable dialogue.Supporting Bridges and Goodman are a myriad of great talent. Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore, Peter Stormare, Sam Elliott, and Philip Seymour Hoffman contribute to film though the one of the best supporting characters has to be John Turturro's Jesus Quintana. Despite only being in two scenes, his role as the pedophile bowler made for one of the best moments. My absolute favorite sequences in the movie have to be the Dude's hallucinations/dream sequences, particularly the GUTTERBALLS number. A great soundtrack, wicked casting, sharp writing, and constant laughs give this movie infinite replay value and it'll never get old.",10,1,2,20 March 2009
Star Trek," A Brilliant Re-Invention of a Long-Loved Franchise
","It has been a long time since I've been so blown away by the Star Trek franchise, with most of it's films in the past 20 years being underwhelming (with the exception of FIRST CONTACT). I was a fan when I was a kid but the later series and films caused my interest to wane of the years. So, when news was released the there was not just another movie in the works, but a reboot, I wasn't entirely thrilled. The inclusion of J.J. Abrams as director grabbed my attention but I was waiting to reserve judgment until it was released. For a STAR TREK reboot movie to truly succeed, the casting would have to be spot-on and it would need to excel where the recent films had failed: plot. After having seen the film in theaters (and multiple times since on DVD), I was blown away at how epic the final product was. STAR TREK was back, and thanks to Abrams, it was better than ever.The plot is probably the weakest element of the film but it was still done well enough that any minor plot grievances on my part were instantly forgiven. The film brings us back to the very beginning, as the familiar crew of the USS Enterprise are completing their run in Starfleet Academy and are first assigned aboard the ship under the command of Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). On it's initial mission, the Enterprise crew encounter a disgruntled Romulan from the future intent on destroying the Federation, one planet at a time, in an attempt to avenge the death of his family and the destruction of his homeworld. In general, it's no so bad but the inclusion of the mysterious, unexplained 'red matter' and use of black holes for time travel felt cliché and didn't fit into the established epic scope of the film.The special effects in the film were amazing! I loved the sleeker, more graceful redesign of the Enterprise and all of the space battle sequences were some of the best since the original STAR WARS trilogy. Granted, Abrams use of lens flares may detract from the style of the movie but the production design was easily one of the most impressive aspects of the film. Everything...the bridge of the Enterprise, the planet Vulcan, everything down to the smallest shuttlecraft...was beautiful.Finally, the most important question in my mind prior to watching the movie: how were the performances of those brought in to replace the original actors for these legendary characters? I was worried the younger cast was going to give the film a WB melodrama vibe but it couldn't be farther from the truth. Each of the cast seemed to embrace the spirit of those who came before them. Chris Pine as James Kirk came off as a bit too abrasive at first, but there were moments where you could see some inspired Shatner in his performance (particularly the Kobyashi Maru simulation scene). One performance I loved that I wish had been given more screen time was that of Simon Pegg as Scotty, who unfortunately doesn't make an appearance until the second hour of the film. The biggest surprise in the film (as I never saw it coming) was Karl Urban's portrayal of Dr. Leonard McCoy. Seriously, Urban captured every mannerism and speech inflection of DeForest Kelley and did his great justice in his performance.Going in with low expectations to this film, I was happy to find it actually ranks as one of my favorite movies in 2009. Abrams has reinvented STAR TREK and made it cool; of all the films in the franchise, this film is the most accessible to non-fans of the series and it can be enjoyed by just about anyone. It's a blast to watch and it's reinvigorated my interest in the franchise after years of disinterest. Enjoy...",9,5,10,24 November 2009
Fight Club," David Fincher's Best and One of My Favorites
","I'm just going to cut to the chase: FIGHT CLUB is awesome. I wish the marketing for the film had been a tad more honest because I put off seeing this movie until almost a decade after it was released. And, even then, I only watched it because I was at a buddy's place and needed something to watch. I was totally caught off guard because I'd always assumed it was just some testosterone-fueled beat-down with some bare bones semblance of a plot. This was before I knew of the awesome that is director David Fincher or author Chuck Palahniuk. This movie is much more than I expected, it's masterfully done, and it's developed a bizarre following on the Web. I just think it's an awesome movie. It's become one of my favorites. The movie follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) who narrates the film. He's an insomniac wallowing in his empty life when he crosses paths with a charismatic soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the Narrator's apartment goes up in a mysterious explosion, he turns to Durden and together they form an underground fight club where men can let loose and beat the tar out of each other. The fight club is only the beginning, as the clubs gain popularity and spread across the nation. The members eventually devolve into a near cult status with Tyler Durden as their leader and the next phase of his grand schemes comes forth: Project Mayhem. Have I mentioned that FIGHT CLUB is awesome?The movie's got everything I could ask for: slick humor, brutal fights, a complex plot, and great characters. I really enjoyed SE7EN but FIGHT CLUB would be the movie that solidified David Fincher as one of my favorite directors. It's become a modern classic that I've seen on countless top-ten lists. The movie touches on a variety of subjects that brought controversy and mixed reactions from critics and audiences. The movie (or more specifically, the character of Tyler Durden) has become an icon for his anarchistic views and anti-establishment terrorism. His anger towards consumerism and our culture's obsession with its possessions is a powerful message, but his acts of domestic terrorism don't seem to hurt his cause much. There is a lot going on in this movie and, with its perfectly built reveal at the end, there is a lot to love here. Even knowing the 'surprise' from the end before settling in to watch this movie, I was blown away. I love the dark humor in the movie, with some of the best moments occurring when characters break the fourth wall. The style of the film works perfect with the dark content and would become the first of many collaborations between Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth with a visual signature that's easy to recognize. All of the elements of this movie come together to make one of the best modern films and a favorite to many (most of them apparently on the Internet). Really, I'm not surprised.I figure it's a given that Edward Norton is a talented actor. I've loved his performances in pretty much every movie I've seen him in. So there's nothing to worry about here as he plays the nameless Narrator, a corporate drone whose life has been much been sapped from him. Norton makes a perfect straight-man to the insanity he invites into his life. His introduction to Tyler Durden is both the best and worst thing that has ever happened to him. Durden is, of course, Brad Pitt. The best part about Pitt in the role is that it made me respect him. I'd always seen Pitt as your average Hollywood pretty-boy but his turn as a total lunatic in FIGHT CLUB proved that he had some skills. He's insane and totally charismatic. It's not hard to see how people could buy into his crazy anti-establishment preachings. He's equal parts hilarious and threatening with absolute confidence in his practices. And then there's Helena Bonham- Carter as Marla Singer, a walking corpse fresh out of a Tim Burton movie. She somehow manages to be attractive while slinking through the film looking like a meth addict. She's the 'not love interest' to Edward Norton. A bizarre parallel to the Narrator's skewed views of reality. Finally, I have to mention Meat Loaf. Yes, for those of you who somehow haven't seen the film yet, Meat Loaf is in the movie as Bob. He's a minor character, but there's no forgetting Bob and hisuhdeformity. Good stuff. There's a hundred reasons to give this movie a chance so I recommend it. If nothing else, it's a great movie to provoke some interesting post-viewing conversation.",10,2,4,8 July 2012
Akira," I think Masaru kind of looks like a small Louie Anderson....
","I am generally not an fan of anime, but there are a couple of exceptions. This movie is the biggest exception. This is one of the few animes I really enjoy. The story revolves around Tetsuo Shima, a young member of a bike gang in Neo-Tokyo. After an incident with a strange young child leaves him injured, he is taken by the government, who awaken latent powers inside him that Tetsuo finds himself consumed with and unable to control. The movie, based off the manga of the same name, is probably one of the few anime films that will ever find itself in my collection.The animation in this movie is fantastic; the movie looks great. My favorite scene in the movie would have to be when Tetsuo awakens in his room at the government facility and he finds himself hallucinating, the toys in his room coming to life. It's one of many awesome visuals in the film. The film contains a good amount of graphic violence and 'frightening' imagery, so this is definitely not a film for a younger audience.I can't think of much to say about the film, except that its worth checking out. It's got an intense story that keeps you entertained throughout and it has sweet/sick animation. There you have it. As I mentioned before, I'm not a fan of most anime but I would recommend this movie to anyone, fan or not.",7,0,3,24 April 2008
Memento," Great Mystery with a Unique Style
","Christopher Nolan has created a classic, and very unique, thriller. Based on the short story written by Nolan's brother, the movie follows Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man on the hunt for the person responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. The catch: Leonard suffers from anterograde amnesia, he is unable to create new memories. So to keep track of his investigation, he must take notes and pictures; in some cases, actually tattooing the facts onto his body. During his hunt, he must learn to distinguish between those who aim to help him, and those who aim to use him.As you probably know, the real interesting aspect of this movie is that its events are told in reverse. The movie begins at the end of the story and works its way to the start. In doing this, Nolan keeps the audience in the same state as Leonard himself. Just as Leonard has no recollection of how he came to be where he is, neither does the person watching the movie. In editing the movie in this way, Nolan helps the audience sympathize with Leonard's situation and his constant confusion. Of course, this style is definitely not for everyone. In fact, a good chunk of the people I've shown this movie to can't stand it for that very reason. They become too confused and can't follow the story, so they give up and walk away. Oh well, in my opinion, it's their loss. I personally thought it made the movie that much better, almost placing the viewer in Leonard's scenario. And despite the fact the movie starts at the end, there are still a couple twists the audience may not see coming.The story, while seemingly a simple concept, is fantastic (and definitely complex). The characters are shady and you never know who to trust. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, a cop who has been helping Leonard in his search, and Carrie-Anne Moss plays a waitress who agrees to help Leonard but may have a deeper connection to the situation. Without knowledge of prior events, like the protagonist, the audience is left suspicious of everyone Leonard encounters.Despite the many haters of this film out there, I think everyone should give this movie a chance. It may be a bit confusing at times, but it all pays off by the time you've figured it out.",7,1,4,23 December 2007
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's Best Since PULP FICTION
","I never would've thought Quentin Tarantino could successfully apply his style of story-telling to historical fiction set in World War II, and I'll never doubt him again. This movie went above and beyond any expectations I had going in, and it's Tarantino's best film since 1994's PULP FICTION. I've read multiple mentions through the years that Tarantino would be creating his WWII epic but after a while, I figured it was just rumors. I'm glad to find I was mistaken. In the film, a series of plots to assassinate Adolph Hitler and the key members of the Third Reich are put into play by a French/Jewish cinema owner (Mélanie Laurent) and a Jewish-American strike force known as the Basterds, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).Simply put: if you're a fan of Tarantino's previous films, then you will most likely love his newest. It's got everything we've come to expect: sharp dialogue, a great story with engaging characters, and the usual visual flair with a killer soundtrack to back it up (this time borrowing heavily from those films providing the writer/director with his inspiration. Just as he's done in the past (as with PULP FICTION and KILL BILL), the film is divided into chapters and culminates in a final chapter when the all of the plans come together into an explosive conclusion.In an ensemble cast, it's rare that any one actor or actress should stand out so far above the rest but, while the entirety of the cast did an incredible job, it was Christoph Waltz who stole my attention in every one of his scenes. A German actor, unknown to American audiences, Waltz's performance as Colonel Hans Landa (or, as his enemies know him, the Jew Hunter) was amazing. He was charming, charismatic, well-mannered, and evil...a villain reminiscent of Hannibal Lector and just as memorable. All of the award nominations he's received for his performance here are well-deserved. I've also got to give credit to Pitt for a great performance as Raine, adopting a heavy Southern drawl and roughing himself up to the point where I lose him in his performance and forget for a while that I'm watching Brad Pitt.To be honest, each of the cast did a fantastic job, with only one of them grating on my nerves a bit. Eli Roth did a fine job as Sergeant Donny 'The Bear Jew' Donowitz but he was annoyingly over-the-top at points. Still, it's never enough to ruin a scene and you won't be pulled out of the movie. I absolutely loved this movie and I hope most others will give it a chance before passing judgment. I realize the 2.5 hour runtime will be a discouraging factor to some but I can reassure you there isn't a single moment in the movie where the pace slows. If you're anything like me, the end credits will start rolling and you'll actually wish there was more.",10,3,11,21 December 2009
This Is the End," THIS IS THE END is Great Fun and a Treat for Fans
","THIS IS THE END is probably the funniest movie of 2013, unless you're not a fan of Seth Rogen and his crew. If you generally avoid his movies, you may as well steer clear because this movie has all the off-color, raunchy, potentially offensive goodies I expect with Rogen and longtime buddy/writing partner Evan Goldberg come together. THIS IS THE END has everything you could possibly want from an apocalyptic comedy: death, gore, bodily fluid gags, demons, demon rape, cannibalism, etc. I love the movie, but no one can say it isn't juvenile. This is not intellectual comedy to engage the mind. It's a movie where stoners discover the joy of drinking their own urine in a crisis situation. In an unusual twist, each of the actors/actresses in the movie portray an exaggerated version of themselves (or their public personas). It begins when Jay Baruchel arrives in Los Angeles for a weekend of fun and catching up with best buddy Seth Rogen. That night, Seth invites Jay to join him for a house- warming party at James Franco's house but Jay's not interested because he doesn't really gel with Seth's new Los Angeles crew of friends. Seth convinces him to go and Jay begins regretting it almost immediately when the Rapture begins and the good citizens of Los Angeles are pulled to Heaven in beams of light while the rest of humanity is left to fend for themselves. Now Jay is trapped in Franco's house with James Franco, Seth Rogen, Craig Robinson, Jonah Hill, and Danny McBride and the crew of spoiled actors are forced to fight for their survival as the world ends around them.This movie is nearly two hours of a bunch of friends getting together and having a blast shooting a high concept comedy. Watching it, you know it had to be crazy fun to work on this set. These guys are all friends on and off camera and it adds an awesome chemistry for the movie. I think that's why I love the idea of each actor playing himself. I'm sure it helped bring their natural friendships into the characters. Each of them is more of a caricature of their public personas or exaggerated versions of their perceived personalities. Seth Rogen is an amiable, cowardly stoner. James Franco is educated and pretentious, with an awkward man crush on Rogen. Jonah Hill is overly saccharine with a holier-than-thou attitude stemming from his Academy Award nomination for his role in MONEYBALL. Craig Robinson is a chill ladies' man, and Danny McBride is an aggressive man-child. Plus the movie is loaded with cameos. I'm pretty sure everyone who's been part of the Apatow scene makes an appearance at Franco's house party in the first act: Michael Cera (as a scene-stealing cokehead), Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, and more (including Rihanna, for some reason). And there are some even better cameos from people you'd never expect, including a post- HARRY POTTER Emma Watson (which isn't news, she's in all the trailers). It only drives home the vibe that this is a bunch of friends coming together to make this movie as fun as possible.I honestly can't think of much to complain about with THIS IS THE END. It does it's job, and it kept me laughing pretty solidly from the opening titles to the end credits. There are some twists you might not see coming and I can honestly say there was rarely a dull moment. Right when you believe they can't possibly take this whole apocalypse scenario any further, they prove you wrong. Writers/directors Rogen and Goldberg throw just about everything they can at these guys, knowing that people will love to see a handful of pampered movie stars squirm under bizarre conditions. Food shortages, looting, demons, personal conflicts, and debating who may or may not be the house rapist are just some of the obstacles these guys will need to overcome if they hope to survive the end times. I really loved this movie and I think the usual fan base for this group of comedians are going to be very happy here. As icing on the cake, we get plenty of allusions to the guys' previous movies. Franco's character in particular has a fondness for keeping props from his previous movies. But the best comes in the form of an unofficial trailer for a sequel to Rogen and Franco's PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I really think this movie was just as much for Rogen and his buddies as it was for the fans. THIS IS THE END is consistently hilarious and it's got some fun surprises, and I wouldn't be surprised if it finishes the years as one of my top favorite films for 2013.",9,1,5,14 December 2013
Iron Man 2," There's a LOT Going On as Iron Man Returns
","IRON MAN 2 was easily my most anticipated movie of 2010. I was a major fan of the first film and, with all the major players returning for the second (with the exception of Terrence Howard), I was psyched. In a sense, IRON MAN 2 followed the same formula that made the first film great. Unfortunately, they followed it so closely that it felt as if they didn't bring anything new to the mix. The film begins about six months after the first left off, with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) publicly admitting his role as Iron Man. News reaches Russia where Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father originally aided Stark's father in his creation of the arc reactor, becomes enraged as his father dies in poverty. He creates a whip harness powered by an arc reactor and soon joins with Tony Stark's rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) in a plan to create Iron Man drones for the military.Having tried to explain the plot just now, it reinforces just how overly complicated the plot of the film ended up. There are a lot of factors director Jon Favreau ended up cramming into the film: Whiplash's drive for revenge on Iron Man, Tony's illness as a result of the palladium in his arc reactor and the search for a cure, Justin Hammer's catering to the military's desire for Iron Man suits, Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) becoming War Machine, and the further development of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the Marvel film universe. Still, while the film does have some trouble fitting it all in, Favreau manages to keep it interesting throughout thanks to the characters involved.Robert Downey Jr. has already proved in the first IRON MAN that he is the perfect actor for the role of Tony Stark and he doesn't lose any ground here. Gwyneth Paltrow continues doing well enough as Pepper Potts, and Cheadle does a great job stepping in for Howard as Colonel Rhodes. Honestly, I feel Cheadle did a better job in the role, and you know it had to be fun stepping in as War Machine (which I know I'd been waiting for more than anything). As the villain of the film, Rourke was awesome as Vanko/Whiplash, but the real scene-stealer was Sam Rockwell as Hammer. Rockwell is a fantastic actor and was my favorite part of the film, oozing sleaze while trying to emulate Stark's playboy attitude.As I'd mentioned, my real complaint lies in that (with the exception of War Machine) this film didn't bring anything new to the table. When you break it down, it's still Iron Man versus another villain in a power suit (or in this case, many suits). My other problem is that Stark never seemed to be in a real danger and it totally robbed the film of any suspense. In the first film, when Iron Man battles Iron Monger at the film's climax, Iron Man's getting beat down until he has Pepper detonate the arc reactor to finally bring Iron Monger down. In this film, when the final battle against Whiplash arrives, it's done so fast that it feels like it's over before it started. Never at any point does it seem like Iron Man's lost control of the situation and he never feels as if he's in any real danger. That sort of takes some of the fun out of it, in my opinion.When I first saw the film, I thought it could've used more action (there aren't many major action scenes) but in the end I'm glad they focused so much on story. With so much going on, there are no loose ends when the final credits roll and there is some nice character development in the film (at least on Stark's part). I would've liked some more time with Whiplash but overall it's still an incredibly entertaining movie and people who enjoyed the first film are almost guaranteed to enjoy this one too.",8,1,2,27 October 2010
Alien: Resurrection," Maybe the Franchise Should Have Died with Ripley Back in 1992
","Here is the third direct sequel in the ALIEN franchise and, by this point, the series has all but completely lost the essence of the original. The film, directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet, contributes nothing new to the series aside from better quality visual effects and a reason (albeit, a weak one) to resurrect Ellen Ripley. The film occurs 200 years after the events on Fiorina 161 and the military has used DNA samples from the impregnated Ripley to cultivate a Queen. Things get out of control and Ripley bands together with the crew of the unregistered freighter BETTY to escape alive. Whereas David Fincher's ALIEN 3 almost seemed to hearken back to the horror/suspense vibe of Ridley Scott's original, this film seems to aim more towards the man versus alien action of James Cameron's ALIENS. Unfortunately for Jeunet's film, it doesn't come close to matching the awesomeness that was Cameron's film.This installment feels hollow and meaningless compared to the previous. Instead of focusing on interesting characters or claustrophobic paranoia, the movie feels more focused on the deaths as the aliens one-by-one pick off the survivors. The only scene with any real impact behind it is Ripley's discovery of the seven failed clone attempts that came before her, and the horror of confronting mutilated versions of herself (while showing her only instance of humanity in the entire film). Otherwise, it's just a paint-by-numbers survival horror film...a two hour period where you watch the survivors get dropped into situation after situation where someone is bound to die. As for the ending, I'm not all that keen on it. The conclusion involves an unforeseen result of the cloning process: Ripley has developed minor traits similar to the aliens (acidic blood, heightened senses and reflexes) and the Queen has developed human traits, namely a uterus that presents the film with it's final threat. The concept didn't sit right with me and it felt to me as if screenwriter Joss Whedon was stretching for ideas.Perhaps the film would've been stronger if they had placed more of emphasis on the characters so their deaths would have an impact. Most of the characters are two-dimensional, with few exceptions. Sigourney Weaver returns for the fourth time as Ellen Ripley or, more accurately, Ripley clone #8. Weaver's spent three films building up a strong but empathetic protagonist and sacrifices it for an extra sequel where her clone is a cold, callous, hissing shell of her former self. Apparently, while Ripley's clone has managed to maintain all of her original memories, it's walked away with none of the best traits that made her who she was. I'll give her credit though, she still looks damn good in this movie.Most of the supporting cast don't fare well. Michael Wincott shows promise as Elgyn, captain of the BETTY, but isn't around long (similar to the filmmakers' treatment of Charles Dance in ALIEN 3); I also enjoyed Gary Dourdan as Christie, though he is also underused (I'm seeing a pattern here...). I'm a fan of Ron Perlman and his tough guy routine, which is all he does here as Johner. Winona Ryder is beautiful but feels incredibly out of place in this film as Call, the newest crew member of the BETTY with her own secrets and intentions. I still don't understand what was up with Dominique Pinon as Vriess; the rest of the 'good' guys (Kim Flowers, Raymond Cruz, and Leland Orser) never really evolve past fresh meat that scream/yell a lot. The film's 'villain', Doctor Wren, is dastardly cartoonish in his portrayal by J. E. Freeman, though it doesn't get much goofier than Dan Hedaya as General Martin Perez. The cornball factor doesn't lend well to a series renowned for it's suspense and horror, and I really felt it weakened the film as a whole.Probably the only aspect of the film that didn't underwhelm me was the visual effects. The shots of the AURIGA and the BETTY were fantastic and the xenomorphs are looking their best since ALIENS. Visual effects technology had improved greatly since 1992's ALIEN 3 so the CG aliens were much more impressive. There is plenty of gore this time around, giving the film a hard R rating, and should satisfy even the pickiest of gore-hounds. In that regard, the film entertains. I hate to sound as if I'm completely slamming the film because it's not terrible, it just doesn't live up to its predecessors. It's a bit more entertaining than ALIEN 3 but it's shallower in depth. The third film at least tried to have more substance whereas this movie accepts it's cookie-cutter format and runs with it, surviving on visual effects and gore.",6,3,4,19 February 2010
World War Z," Mindless Action and PG-13 Zombies; Weak, but Serviceable
","WORLD WAR Z was everything I expected from director Marc Forster, the man behind QUANTUM OF SOLACE. It's an action-centric PG-13 zombie film with a major actor in the foreground to draw in mainstream audiences for a guaranteed box office success. I've heard nothing but awesome buzz about the novel from Max Brooks that loans the movie its title (and apparently not much else) but I've not had a chance to read it before seeing the movie. I suppose this might've helped me keep a more unbiased perspective when watching it, since I wouldn't spend the movie grumbling about all the wasted potential in the source material. Nope, instead I had my own series of gripes with the film. Primarily, I hated that the movie seemed more interested in crafting major action sequence after major action sequence than actually creating an engaging plot. I wouldn't go so far as to call WORLD WAR Z a bad movie, but it's certainly the epitome of mindless summer entertainment. The movie follows former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) as he and his family struggle to survive once the zombie apocalypse erupts across the world. Once his family is secured on a naval vessel, Lane is roped into joining an investigation into the origins of the zombie epidemic. Lane jets off to start his investigation in South Korea and will follow the trail around the globe in hopes of finding the source and, maybe, a cure or vaccine to save the planet from collapsing under the scourge of the undead.Let's start with a minor quibble. What sort of fun can you expect from a PG-13 zombie film? Seriously. Zombies are rotting, shambling undead with a hunger for human flesh. But WORLD WAR Z spares us any real violence or gore associated with the zombie genre, instead giving us swarms of indistinguishable zombies and bursts of mostly bloodless gunfire. The zombies in the film are (mostly) your typical fast-sprinting, growling beasts. Some discoloration of the skin and a bit of blood around the mouth, with the occasional bit of facial deterioration when you're lucky enough to see one up close. No disembowelments or half- mangled zombies with their insides out. It's all toned down to fit into its more audience friendly PG-13 rating. The zombies are treated as more of a global virus, swarming and climbing over obstacles in tidal waves of faceless monsters. Their shot and blown up without any payoff and the victims are never more than tackled and vaguely munched on, convulsing on the ground before jumping up to join the masses. I don't know. Maybe I'm just old- fashioned but I miss when zombies weren't yowling athletes who run down their prey at super speeds. This leads into my next major problem with WORLD WAR ZThis movie is all about the massive action sequences. Plot takes a back seat to elaborate action scenes on a global scale. As if to make sure you know what you're in for, the movie gives you little to no time to introduce its characters. We get five minutes of a family pancake breakfast with Gerry, his wife, and their two daughters before we're thrown right in to the first major action scene: the fall of Philadelphia. From then on, we get bits of character development to fill the quiet moments between explosive action scenes as Gerry begins his globetrotting mission. The scenes themselves are pretty impressive. I'm not going to deny that. When the zombies invade Jerusalem, it's a pretty awesome sight; and the initial chaos in Philadelphia sets the tone for the film pretty effectively. My problem isn't with the action or its execution; it's that it's the main focus of the movie. Just as with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, the plot here is nothing but filler for when people aren't running from zombies or slaughtering them by the dozen. The best part of the whole movie (for me) was the final act when Lane arrives at a World Health Organization center in Wales where the bombastic action steps aside and allows for some quiet suspense. The Wales portion of the film is exactly the sort of stuff I love in a zombie movie. Taut and thrilling with our main character stalking through a facility trying to avoid confrontation as opposed to just running in, guns blazing. I thought the final resolution was a nice touch. Lane's major discovery that is meant to turn the tide of the war against the zombies is an interesting development, but I wonder how it took so long for someone to formulate that theory. Someone had to have noticed it before Lane had his realization so late into the zombie war. Whatever. Thoughtful storytelling isn't exactly this movie's strongest point.WORLD WAR Z is a perfect example of mindless summer action. Leave your brain at the door when you settle in for this one and try to find fun in all the gunfire and zombie hordes. You won't want to try and think about this one too hard. Kudos to Brad Pitt for his role in the film. Pitt's a great actor and he brings some gravitas to a genre that doesn't often see big name stars in the cast. He does the best he can with pretty weak material, but he's mostly just running from Point A to Point B while avoiding becoming some zombie's next meal. The visual effects are great and the final act attempts to redeem the movie's otherwise shallow, lazy nature. WORLD WAR Z is far from memorable and I suppose its greatest success was provoking me into reading the novel to see what I've missed.",7,0,2,30 November 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Russell Brand is the Major Highlight
","Jason Segel proves he's more than just a great supporting character actor as he writes and stars in another highlight from producer Judd Apatow's crew. Based on his own break-up experiences, Segel wrote the film around Peter Bretter, a musician who is dumped by his TV star girlfriend (the titular Sarah Marshall). In an effort to pull himself from his miserable situation, Peter vacations to Hawaii and finds himself staying at the same resort as Sarah and her new boyfriend, English glam-rocker Aldous Snow. Through the course of his stay in Hawaii, Peter deals with Sarah's new relationship while meeting the odd locals and, more importantly, the cute hotel clerk.As with Apatow's 'Knocked Up', this movie doesn't have as much in-your-face laugh-out-loud moments but it's still got great comedic performances from the entire cast. Seriously though, the funniest part of the whole film was Russell Brand as Aldous Snow. That man was so funny, he stole every scene he was in. I also wish Paul Rudd (as over-backed surf instructor Koonu) and Bill Hader (as Peter's step-brother Brian) had larger parts in the film, as they were hilarious. Jason Segel, Kristen Bell, and Mila Kunis give great honest performances as the key players, so it all adds up to make the film of my favorite from the Apatow canon.This movie is great from anyone who has ever found themselves in the same situation as it helps you see it all with a comedic eye. I loved the characters and we're introduced to Russell Brand, whom I hope to see in more Apatow films in the future. The movie did seem to wander aimlessly at points but it never became boring, as there was always something funny around the corner. It feels a bit long in its near two-hour runtime but it doesn't feel wasted. I generally don't go for romantic comedies but this is one of the best I've seen.",9,2,6,4 November 2008
The Hunger Games," THE HUNGER GAMES is Surprisingly Good for Teen-Oriented Series
","I never intended on giving THE HUNGER GAMES any attention. All I knew from the marketing campaign was that it was based on a series of young adult novels all I could think was TWILIGHT. When the reviews started coming out and the word was overwhelmingly positive, I figured I might have to rethink my position on the movie. Not enough to see it in theaters, but I did check it out when it was released on home video and I was pleasantly surprised. For the most part, it lived up to a lot of the hype as a great film for both teens and adults. The movie is based on the first novel in a series from Suzanne Collins set in a dystopian future when America has suffered through a great internal struggle. The nation, now known as Panem, is now separated into the high class of the Capitol and twelve poverty-stricken districts that each specialize in a particular resource. The Hunger Games is an even held each year where two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts, one male and one female between the ages of twelve and eighteen, and placed in a battle to the death until one victor remains. The Games are meant to remind the people of Panem of the Capitol's dominance and discourage any future revolutionary behavior. When her sister's name is called as tribute for the 74th annual games, Katniss Everdeen volunteers in her place and must now fight for her life against 23 other tributes if she hopes to survive the Hunger Games.Honestly, I'm surprised this is as popular as it is with the teen/preteen crowd. This is a well- thought science fiction tale set in a future where the wealthy have tightened their oppression over the lower class to the point where they force them to murder each other for their own amusement. It's reality television taken to a whole new level, and we know how much America loves its reality TV. After everything I'd heard about the laughable love story in the TWILIGHT movies, I really expected this movie to be the same. I just assumed that's what it took to grab the attention of the teen girls that made this movie such a phenomenon. Again, I was wrong. There is a blossoming relationship in the movie between Katniss and a fellow tribute, but it's not the central focus. If anything, it's a subplot. Katniss's motivation in the movie isn't to find true love, it's to survive the Games and see her family again. Despite how good this movie turned out to be, I won't be running out to buy the novels anytime soon so I couldn't tell you if it's something that develops later in the series. I sure hope not. THE HUNGER GAMES has a good thing going here and I'd hate for it to break off into some melodramatic love triangle. I may not be interested in the novels, but this movie has guaranteed my interest in the inevitable sequel.The production design was probably the best part of this movie. The world of Panem is a bizarre one. The twelve districts are almost primitive in their designrural and low tech. The Capitol, on the other hand, is massive and colorful. People dress in abstract fashions with freakish hairstyles and flashy wardrobes. Think Victorian England on LSD. The action in the movie is as good as one can expect in a PG-13 film aimed at teenagers. Despite the bloody premise behind the movie, the action is mostly cut fast and bloodless. A lot of chaotic camera shaking and implied violence before cutting away. As a result, the violence doesn't hit as hard as it could but, again, this movie was based on a book series aimed at kids that can't cough up ticket money for an R-rated bloodbath. And then there are the characters, each of them memorable in their own right. Jennifer Lawrence is amazing as Katniss. Beautiful and stoic, she's a strong character and Lawrence is guaranteed to go on to a great career. Woody Harrelson stands out in the movie as a past Hunger Games victor who acts as mentor to Katniss and her fellow District 12 tribute. He's tortured from his time in the Games and persistently drunk, but he soon finds faith in Katniss as a potential winner. There's a lot of talent gathered here in both the cast and crew, and director Gary Ross has done an awesome job. As someone who can't stand the usual teen-oriented entertainment, I can say that I'll be following this series when the sequels arrive.",8,0,3,20 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," My Favorite PIRATES Film
","When the first sequel to the immensely successful PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was released in 2006, it was the recipient of mixed reviews from critics and fans. I can see how the film may have driven off some viewers, with it's seemingly complicated plot and less humor than it's predecessor. I am an avid supporter of this film and find it to be my favorite movie of the Bruckheimer/Verbinski series. The two final films were shot consecutively and the second movie acts as a means of setting up for the final act in part three. The film revolves around the chest containing the heart of Davy Jones and the race to acquire it. Jack Sparrow's hoping to escape a horrible fate at the hands of Jones' pet, Will Turner seeks to free his recently-discovered father from Jones' crew, and disgraced ex-Commodore Norrington wants to regain his life by turning the heart over to the East India Trading Company.The original cast returns from the first film, with some great new additions. Depp, of course, as Sparrow remains one of the most memorable film characters he's ever portrayed though I will admit some of his lines didn't sit right with me. There were points where I couldn't help but feel some the lines felt forced and didn't fit. I'm still not overly impressed with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner but Keira Knightley brought more to her role this time around as Elizabeth is evolving into a stronger character than we've seen. Also returning, is Jack Davenport as Norrington who receives a more prominent role and becomes invaluable to the sequels. Seeing as how Barbossa was killed in the first film, the sequel was in need of a new villain so, outshining all others, we have Bill Nighy's addition to the cast as what has become one of my favorite film villains...Davy Jones. Nighy brought so much to the character and did a fantastic job bringing a completely CGI character to life.While mentioning the CGI, you will also note that it's improved since the original film. The character of Jones is so realistic at times you'd be hard-pressed not to think the make-up was done practically. Jones' crew, a mix of half-human/half-sea creatures, look fantastic but suffer at moments from the same issues as the undead pirates from the first film where the CG tends to stand out at times. There have been a lot of complaints that the story was too confusing, but I disagree. I admit I was somewhat confused at first but everything became clear as I was watching the film and had a firm grasp on the story upon my first viewing. Granted, there is a lot going on in this film and it easily fills the 2.5 hour run time but it's not time wasted. My best advice is to relax and enjoy the movie, and if you can, try to pick up on the subtle foreshadowing scattered throughout. DEAD MAN'S CHEST was easily the most enjoyable of this trilogy for me and the surprise at the end, right before the end credits roll, was enough to ensure I'd be back for the third.",9,0,1,12 October 2009
Argo," A Tight, Suspenseful Dramatization of the Canadian Caper
","I'm admittedly pretty late to the Ben Affleck/director bandwagon. His first film, GONE BABY GONE, went under my radar and I passed on THE TOWN because I wasn't interested in another heist film. He's been collecting praise for his directing efforts for years but it wasn't until ARGO that I actually sat down and watched one of his movies. The premise was one that had grabbed my attention since originally reading about the Canadian Caper in an article on Cracked.com. The movie is based on actual events, but I'm not knowledgeable enough in subject to tell you what's accurate and what isn't. So it's safe to say that I watched this as a movie for entertainment and not as a propaganda piece for America or the CIA, as some have appeared to view it. ARGO is the tale of six staff members for the U.S. embassy in Tehran, Iran during a tumultuous time in which citizens of the country were rioting over the United States' involvement in providing asylum for the former Iranian Shah while he sought treatment for cancer. The riots soon grow out of hand and enraged Iranian civilians overrun the embassy, taking its staff of 52 hostage. Six Americans escaped during the fray and find sanctuary with the Canadian ambassador in his home. The clock is ticking and the U.S. is worried that the Iranians will discover the escapees, so the CIA becomes involved in forming a plan to retrieve them. Enter CIA agent Tony Mendez (Affleck) with a plan to enter Iran and walk the Americans right out through a commercial airport under the guise of a location scout for a Canadian film crew. It's one of those 'so crazy, it has to work' scenarios.ARGO is good. Best Picture good? Maybe. There might have been more deserving movies in 2012 but I don't feel that ARGO ruined any lives by walking away with the award. It's an incredibly good film that manages to grab its audience on an emotional level, and it tells an amazing story. Regardless of how it's portrayed in the film, the events depicted in the movie happened in one sense of another: the Iranians raged at the United States, 52 embassy staff were taken as hostages for a grueling 444 days, and six escapees were aided in escaping the country as a Canadian film crew. That alone is an incredible tale. This is Ben Affleck's vision of the events and, yes, they are very America-centric. You sort of have to expect that from an American film. Once you overlook that and just absorb ARGO as a piece of entertainment, it succeeds. Affleck does an excellent job of ratcheting up the suspense in the film. These characters are in a dangerously tight spot and you feel for them. They're terrified, paranoid, and never know if the next day will be their last. There is a scene in the middle of the movie where Mendez, in an effort to solidify their cover story, must take the six escapees into Tehran's bazaar where all eyes are on them after a few mere hours to try and learn their false identities. It's tense. Even knowing that everything turns out all right in the end, it's tense. I'd say that makes for a successful film.I also loved the alternating vibes of the film. The scenes in Iran are taut and ominous. We're treated to multiple scenes emphasizing the rampant anti-American sentiment and the dangerous conditions. The scenes in Hollywood are loud and boisterous, with mansions, glamorous parties, and a soundtrack including Van Halen and the Dire Straits. The only instance of Western music once we're in Iran is an excellent use of Led Zeppelin's 'When the Levee Breaks', used perfectly to reflect the tension as the American's celebrate the night before their big escape while Mendez is confronted with the possibility of abandoning the mission and leaving them behind. Back in America, everything is a bit more light-hearted with John Goodman and Alan Arkin portraying the Hollywood connections that helped Mendez create a fake movie from scratch and pass it off as a legitimate venture to fool the Iranians. Goodman and Arkin are a couple of scene-stealers and provide a bit of levity to break up the gloom of the Iranian situation.If I have any complaint about the movie, I guess it would be that I was underwhelmed with the ending. The big climactic scene in Iranian airport where the Americans are within reach of freedom is a little too forced. The cuts between the Mendez and the escapees, the Iranian police, and the CIA offices felt as if they were trying a bit too hard to make it suspenseful. Still, I suppose it got the job done. ARGO is a fine movie and probably ranks somewhere in my top ten best for 2012.",9,6,10,22 June 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Drink Up Me Hearties, Yo Ho...
","I remembering being completely uninterested when I first heard of this film. Understandably, seeing as how a movie from Disney based off of a ride from their theme park didn't sound as if it'd provide the strongest foundation for a feature film. It wasn't until my girlfriend of the time convinced me to watch it that I finally agreed and I'm really glad I did. This movie was nothing close to what I was expecting, blowing away every expectation I'd set for it...it was funny, exciting, engaging, and wasn't as PC or family-friendly as your average Walt Disney film. The story follows Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) as he embarks on a quest to reclaim his ship, the Black Pearl, from his mutinous first mate, Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). What Jack doesn't know is that Barbossa and his crew have since acquired a curse, giving them immortality...at a price. Honestly, the story actually appears to have stronger ties to the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and William Turner (Orlando Bloom), but let's face it...the pirates are better.Director Gore Verbinski and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have really outdone themselves with this film. They have managed to bring together some incredible elements to create a memorable film that was easily one of the best movies in 2003. The production value was incredible, with excruciating detail apparent in everything from the costume design and make-up to the beautiful set design. Throw in a cast that was top-notch (and that includes the supporting players) and you've got a great conglomeration. We all know how hilarious Depp was in his iconic role as the not-as-clueless-as-he-seems Captain Jack and he alone is worth seeing this movie at least once. Equal in every way is Geoffrey Rush as the evil Barbossa, who's performance I don't feel is getting enough attention. The movie could've focused on Depp and Barbossa without all of the other plot devices and it still would've been great based on the skill of the two alone. Keira Knightley was beautiful in her role as Elizabeth and seemed to pull her weight against the heavyweight stars; Orlando Bloom, on the other hand, didn't wow me but he also didn't weaken the film. I'd wrong not to include kudos for Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg, Mackenzie Crook, Kevin McNally and the rest of the great cast who brought the film to life.Seeing as how the major plot device involves undead pirates, the special effects were a crucial element. For the most part, they never disappoint. There are a few moments where the CGI was a bit too apparent and it throws you back into reality for a moment but only for a moment before the characters draw you back in. Writers Ted Elliot, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie, and Jay Wolpert did an awesome job turning nothing (an amusement park ride) into something and Verbinski took that something and created a fun, funny and most importantly memorable summer film.",8,0,4,7 October 2009
Star Trek Into Darkness," A Solid, Exciting Second Adventure; Cumberbatch is Awesome
","It seems 2013 is the year of fan rage, as it seems pretty much every major summer blockbuster became the object of their unmitigated anger. While the others seemed to infuriate fans for changing details, STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS appears to fall on the opposite end of the spectrum. People seem aggravated that the filmmakers were too eager to reference the source material (while at the same time, simplifying it for a wider audience). In the case of just about every major movie released this summer, I feel like I'm in the minority of people who actually enjoyed them, and that includes our second adventure in the new STAR TREK universe. It wasn't as good as the first film but it was a solid, exciting film and one of the best we're bound to get. It begins about a year after the events of the first film with Captain Kirk using his command of the U.S.S. Enterprise to violate just about every rule in Starfleet. When an unsanctioned mission to save a primitive race from extinction brings the wrath of his superiors and puts him at odds with Spock, Kirk nearly loses his command position before it every truly gets started, but a terrorist attack on a Starfleet facility in London leaves him with no time to dwell on it. After suffering a personal loss, Kirk makes it his mission to hunt down this terrorist, a man going by the name John Harrison, and bring him to justice. Pursuing the man deep into enemy territory, Kirk finally confronts him to discover that he's more than he appears to be and he might not be the largest threat on the horizon.I really enjoyed INTO DARKNESS. It's not quite as fun on repeat viewings but there's still a lot I loved about this movie. For better or worse, our new STAR TREK is a more action-oriented franchise and the action is always bigger than life. I swear, J.J. Abrams primary mission in these movies is to put the Enterprise through as much pain and suffering as he can to get the money shots that'll put audiences in the seats. We get the Enterprise falling through an atmosphere, rising out of an ocean, rising above clouds, rocketing out of warp speedevery conceivably cool shot he can imagine, he'll find a way to fit it into the movie. And I can't complain because, frankly, the effects in this movie are so awesome that these shots look absolutely amazing. Of course, there are also plenty of brutal hand-to-hand combat and phaser battles because our new TREK isn't a mission of peace. Once relegated to the occasional away mission, action is the name of the game now. The production design, makeup effects, and visual effects are all top notch as you'd expect from a nearly $200 million budget. No one can argue that this movie doesn't look fantastic. It's one of my favorite things about the new franchise; we get an updated, modernized interpretation of a classic universe. Speaking of classic, this movie manages to shoehorn in Klingons, tribbles, and casual references to Harry Mudd and Nurse Chapel.And here is where it seemed to get a lot of negative chatter. The writers and director have been accused of straight-up ripping off STAR TREK II because (and I refuse to consider this a spoiler seeing as how Benedict Cumberbatch is credited as the character on just about any cast list you find) Khan Noonien Singh returns and the movie makes more than a few loving references to THE WRATH OF KHAN. To give my opinion, no, I am not outraged about all the little homages scattered throughout the movie and I believed the plot was different enough from anything done in WRATH OF KHAN to avoid accusations of laziness. Aside from a major sequence near the end of the film (now THAT is a spoiler and I won't ruin it) that felt a little too on-the-nose and was resolved way, way too simply, I had no complaints in that regard. In fact, I thought Cumberbatch was an awesome Khan. He was sinister, intelligent, and an intimidating presence with his cold, calculating demeanor. He gave the constant impression that Khan was a powerful man and always in control of the situation, even when he shouldn't be. He was not as eccentric in the role as Ricardo Montalban in STAR TREK II, but I think he gives an equally powerful performance. You believe this man would slaughter every man and woman in his path to achieve his goals. Alice Eve is another addition to the cast as a weapons expert who invites herself aboard the Enterprise on its manhunt while hiding her own agenda (dodging some more minor spoilers here), but she doesn't do much. I don't know, maybe next time, I guess.If fans want something to complain about, there're better things to complain about. Despite not having watched any of the series regularly in years, I'm pretty sure the Enterprise isn't capable of flying within an atmosphere (which it does twice here), much less landing and taking off. How does the Enterprise go from Earth orbit to the heart of Klingon space in ridiculously fast time? How did Khan teleport across so many systems? Was another high- speed space jump sequence really necessary? I guess it must've been so popular in the first film they felt the need to do it again and up the ante. How was the construction of a warship kept secret in the middle of a bustling stat system? Why was the Klingon moon already destroyed despite not occurring until STAR TREK VI? Although I guess that last one could be copped up to the whole reimagined timeline bit. Regardless, the new franchise is one of mass appeal and, understanding that we probably won't see a STAR TREK film like the old days, this one's pretty good for what it is.",8,4,6,22 November 2013
Hostel," Eli Roth Gives Us a Taste of Humanity's Dark Side
","I don't recall watching HOSTEL in the theater. I'm pretty sure I did, but I have no recollection of it whatsoever. For whatever reason, my brain has totally blocked any memory of originally seeing the movie. All I remembered was that it was brutally violent and helped the SAW series solidify the profitable nature of 'torture porn'. I hadn't watched the movie in years when I saw it sitting in my collection a few weeks back and decided to reintroduce myself to Eli Roth's gore-fest. After watching it again with a few years of letting it settle in at the back of my mind, I realized it's a little better than I rememberand a little less violent. That's not to say the movie seems tamer after watching it again. HOSTEL can never be considered tame. HOSTEL is the story of three friends backpacking through Europe: Paxton, Josh, and their new Icelandic friend Oli, the 'King of the Swing'. These guys are one a never-ending quest to get laid and, when Amsterdam doesn't quite live up to their expectations, they're directed to a hostel in Slovakia that's loaded with available women. Arriving in Slovakia and settling into the rumored hostel, the trio make a connection with two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana, who act as their guide to the booming nightlife. But soon, things take a dark turn as Oli disappears one night, supposedly making a sudden return home, and the hostel starts feeling a little less welcoming. By the time we learn the hostel's horrible secret, it's already too late.Let me start by admitting that I'm not a horror fan. Less than 20% of my total DVD collection might fall into the genre. The average horror movie has nothing to offer me and my personal tastes. So a horror movie needs to have an interesting angle or some incredibly good reviews for me to hunt it down, and HOSTEL has just that. The premise behind HOSTEL is an intriguing one and is rumored to be based on truth (in that the organization at the center of the movie might be based on an existing service). When I watch a horror movie, it's got to be truly frightening and the idea that psychopaths like the ones we see in this movie might actually be out there somewhere doing business is a grim one. We all have the ability to commit horrific acts and the concept that there are people out there that embrace this ability and treat it as fun or a form of release is disgusting. And this movie is, if anything, disgusting. In a good way, though. The movie gives us a solid 45 minutes to get to know these characters before they get to the meat of the film. Even if they do come off as a bit two-dimensional at first, it gives us a chance to know them so when the horrible stuff hits, it's got more of an effect. The first half of the movie is pretty slow and, at times, outright boring but it all builds up to a gripping final half hour.The gore in the movie is awesome. I love practical gore. I'll take some rubber intestines over a CG disemboweling every time. HOSTEL runs with practical horror effects and it comes off as that much more disturbing. There are a few instances where it might not have looked quite right (for those who've seen the movie, I'm primarily referring to Kana) but it's all part of the fun of going over the top. Eli Roth has an obvious passion for the horror genre and, if there's any doubt, listen to any one of the multiple commentary tracks that come with each of his HOSTEL movies. His passion for terrifying an audience and his solid grasp of storytelling make HOSTEL a pretty cool movie. He uses a bunch of unknown actors in the film which, while I'm sure helped keep the overall cost to a minimum, also helped see the victims in the movie as real people. I'd never heard of Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, and Eythor Gudjonsson before, and, really, I haven't heard from them since. I hear Gudjonsson is pretty big in Iceland though. The real stars of the movie are the villains, who are fleshed out a little better. Particularly the Dutch Businessman, played by Jan Vlasák. Considering that Vlasák doesn't speak English, it's that much more impressive how menacing he comes across. Eli Roth's HOSTEL is a really good movie for what it is, and this is coming from a non-horror freak. The violence is brutal but shot in just such a way that a lot the worst happens off- screen or in quick glimpses, and Roth leaves the audience's minds fill in the blank. If more effort had been put into creating some more sympathetic victims, this movie would've been even stronger.",7,2,2,11 December 2012
Green Room," Brutal, Blood-Soaked Battle: Punk Rockers vs Neo-Nazis
","I was sold on GREEN ROOM the moment I found out Patrick Stewart is the villain. Not just any villain either, but the head of an organization of rural neo- Nazis. And, to keep the STAR TREK connections flowing, he and his skinheads are going up against a punk band in which the lead guitarist is played by Anton Yelchin who played the young Pavel Chekov in the 2009 reboot and onward. Then GREEN ROOM went on to earn a certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and I was excited. I love a good genre film and GREEN ROOM is a horror/thriller that will effectively keep you on edge. The film focuses on a small-time punk band called the Ain't Rights as they're coming to the end of a cross-country tour. They're a handful of die-hards in it for the music and embracing the struggle, driving all hours and siphoning gas because these gigs aren't paying the greatest. As the movie begins, they find themselves in the Pacific northwest when a promised gig proves to be a bust. Just as they're about ready to call it done and start the long ride home, their local contact promises them a better venue and the chance for some decent cash. The only downside: they're playing to skinheads. Just keep it cool and don't play anything that'll set them off, and it'll be fine. The gig, at a private bar in the middle of the Oregon wilderness, goes well enough, but one wrong move on their way out ensures they won't be allowed to leave alive.The band finds themselves trapped in the skinhead bar's green room with the owner (Stewart) at first trying to reassure them that everything will be fine, the police are on the way, and soon this whole ordeal will be sorted out. Meanwhile, the neo-Nazis have a secret to protect on this property and that means these scrawny rockers can't be allowed to ruin their operation. What follows is a brutally violent battle of punks vs. Nazis where the Ain't Rights are going to have to force themselves out of their comfort zones and face death head-on if they plan on seeing their way out of there. The band consists of Yelchin with Alia Shawkat, and relative unknowns (to me) Joe Cole and Callum Turner. It's the band that sells it and makes this movie, at times, pretty painful to watch. They give the band a grounded realism as your average aimless youths with nothing more in mind than getting drunk and playing their music So when these stone-cold killers come at them armed with machetes and trained attack dogs, they react with a very real panic. These characters aren't action heroes. They're still practically kids and this is a very real danger for them. So, when they get the nerve to finally try and turn the tables on their enemies, it's sloppy and often ineffective, and when people start to die it provokes a gut reaction, unlike a lot of other slasher films out there where you're too detached to care about the heroes.It's a treat to see Patrick Stewart as the villain, especially one as horrible as this. His character, Darcy, is the head of this operation and storms on to the scene once his lieutenants alert him to the problem of a pesky corpse and the police having been called to the scene. He operates with composure and he's got a plan to make sure all of this goes away before it can destroy everything he's worked to build. He's soft-spoken, though that may just be because Stewart's slight southern drawl barely conceals his underlying English accent, but the character's realize early on that he's not your average gentle old man. Adding to the sickly feeling of uneasiness in the film is the sharp cinematography of Sean Porter. The whole movie has a dim, overcast feel evocative of the rainy northwest (whether that was a decision or just a result of filming in Oregon, I don't know but it works) and, of course, the movie has a greenish hue due in part to the use of fluorescent lighting in the bar and the rich greens of the surrounding Oregon forest. It works in conjunction with the film's grimy characters and bloody violence to give GREEN ROOM the nightmarish quality it needs to put your in the minds of these innocent punks who've been dumped in the worst case scenario and might not live to see the sunrise.",7,1,4,15 June 2017
The Babadook," The Heartwarming Tale of a Single Mom and her Poltergeist Raising her Wildly Undisciplined Son...
","THE BABADOOK was a decent movie but I was disappointed after my first viewing thanks to all the hype behind it. There were a bunch of reviews touting it as terrifying and one of the scariest films of the year; I'm pretty sure there was even a quote from William Friedkin (director of THE EXORCIST) praising it as the most terrifying movie he's ever seen. The film, from first-time feature director Jennifer Kent, is about Amelia (Essie Davis) and her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman). Samuel's father died in a car accident driving a pregnant Amelia to the hospital the day Samuel was born, so it's just been the two of them ever since. It's been rough going, with Amelia stuck in a thankless job and Samuel developing behavioral issues. Severe behavioral issues. He's getting in trouble in schoolfor bringing homemade weapons and his own aunt can't stand to be around him. Then, one night, Amelia goes to read Samuel a bedtime story and discovers a strange new book on the shelf, 'The Babadook'. It's a twisted little pop-up book that scares the wits out of Samuel and, as if that isn't bad enough, it's merely the start of a series of bizarre occurrences. Soon Samuel is 'seeing' the Babadook and he becomes petrified that the shadowy creature is invading their home. Amelia's frustration with the boy skyrockets when he acts out against this invisible specter but we begin to wonderis it Amelia's years of frustration boiling over or has the Babadook found a host?Maybe it's just me. Maybe I'm just desensitized but THE BABADOOK wasn't much of a horror film. Thriller, sure. Certainly a drama. But I wouldn't classify it as horror. I was never at any point scared of anything. These warped expectations ruined my initial viewing. I'd bought the movie, reading so much good about it, and sat down with a couple beers for a good scare. Halfway through, I was so put-off by the misdirection that I couldn't be bothered to care. It wasn't until my second viewing, this time know what I was getting in to, that I began to recognize it as a good film. It still wasn't scary but, since I was watching it fresh, I was able to recognize how talented the filmmakers were at creating a constant state of suspense. THE BABADOOK is a very tense film. The visuals are drab and drained of color; Amelia's house is full of cool blue shades and shadowy corners. The rising tension throughout the beginning of the film is slow but you can see it all building up to the point where it'll burst. You can't help but sympathize with Amelia in the beginning; her job sucks and her son is a royal pain. Samuel appears to have two modes: hyperkinetic and screaming. It's not surprise that she's as burnt out as she is, having dealt with this life for years with no one by her side. Anyone could go nuts in such a rut.Then the Babadook arrives and it's too much for Amelia to bear. Things get interesting and I love that, the second time around, I noticed that it's not all as cut and dry as I'd thought. I realized that it leaves it ambiguous whether there really is a supernatural being haunting their little family or perhaps Amelia has finally just snapped and everything occurring in the film is her unconscious mind acting out. It's only really this element that keeps the film all that interesting and I've read some interesting interpretations online. But does it stand out in the genre? Not really; not to me. If you're thinking of checking out THE BABADOOK, manage your expectations and don't let the hype get them too high. It's pretty slowly paced and can feel as if it's dragging at times. The final act where everything finally falls apart is pretty entertaining. In terms of casting, this is essentially a two-person show with Davis and Wiseman. Davis does a fine job as the increasingly fragile Amelia and Wisemanwellyou get used to his antics as the film progresses and, despite his annoying nature, you'll most likely be on his side by the end. There are a few minor characters. Barbara West is their kind, elderly neighbor who is always on the verge of getting involved when things have obviously taken a turn for the worse in Amelia's home but was never bothered enough to get the authorities involved. Amelia's snobbish sister Claire (Hayley McElhinney) sees her sister's suffering but couldn't seem to care less. Really, the Babadook should stop worrying about Samuel and needs to focus his energies on the useless people surrounding Amelia. That, I think we could all agree on. Anyway, THE BABADOOK, while not as game-changing as some critics might want you to believe, is a serviceable supernatural (?) thriller and is probably worth your time if you're bored on a quiet night.",7,4,8,19 December 2015
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Funny as hell, the first few times...
","'South Park: Bigger, Longer, & Uncut' is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I laughed my ass off the first time I saw it. In this film, the parents of South Park declare war on Canada after a movie starring Terrence and Phillip, Canada's star fart-joke comedians and only source of income, corrupts the children with foul language. This movie has the same style of humor as the television show it is based on, only now Trey Parker and Matt Stone don't have to abide by broadcasting decency laws.This is one of those movies that has parent and religious groups going spastic over the content. While it does have a lot of vulgarity, the movie also has an underlying message about censorship and first amendment rights. If you watch this movie looking for a good time, and not a soul-enlightening experience, you'll be fine.The only problem with this film is that it lacks replay value. Once you have seen it two or three times, it is easy to lose interest. Jokes won't have the same kick. But for some reason the songs never get old. The funniest part of this movie is the musical numbers, my personal favorite being 'Blame Canada' (which went on to be nominated for an Oscar).This movie is definitely one of my favorite animated movies. I can only hope they decide to make a sequel.",8,0,1,26 May 2005
Ted," TED is Hilarious!
","We all knew Seth MacFarlane would make the transition to features at some point. Whether or not you were excited at the prospect depends entirely on how much a fan you are of his small screen prime-time cartoons. I've been a fan of 'Family Guy' since the beginning, even if my interest has waned in later seasons as the show has fallen into routine without the continual strength of the earlier episodes. And I'm a casual fan of 'The Cleveland Show' and 'American Dad.' So MacFarlane's first feature film was guaranteed to sell me a movie ticket, regardless of what it was (though, to be honest, I'm glad he didn't just cash in on an easy 'Family Guy' film). MacFarlane's style of comedy shines through in TED, so people who aren't a fan of his shows might not be impressed with his first film. Cut-away gags, pop culture references, and raunchy jokes made funnier with the fact that they're being spewed from a stuffed bear. Speaking as a MacFarlane fan (and therefore biased, I suppose), I really loved TED. It's an age-old tale of a young boy's love for his best friend, a teddy bear he receives for Christmas. A Christmas wish brings little Ted to life and, twenty years later, John Bennett and Ted are still best buds. But playtime and childhood has been replaced with weed and FLASH GORDON, and the friendship between these two slackers risks destroying John's relationship with his girlfriend Lori unless he can learn to grow up.As a fan, I actually thought MacFarlane's style transitioned nicely to a feature film. The cut- away gags are kept to a minimum and are used effectively. The pop culture references are everywhere, in just about every joke, with a special focus on the 1980 movie version of FLASH GORDON starring Sam Jones. MacFarlane must have a soft spot for the movie because it gets a lot of attention, with Jones even popping in for a hilarious cameo in the middle of the movie. Every time I've seen TED, Queen's FLASH GORDON theme is stuck in my head for the next two days. Maintaining the MacFarlane vibe are a bunch of his TV buddies filling out some of the movie's supporting roles: Alex Borstien, Ralph Garman, Patrick Warburton, Ryan Reynolds, and, of course, Patrick Stewart as the voice of the narrator. It's a 'Family Guy' fan's perfect movie. Mila Kunis (another 'Family Guy' star) is John's girlfriend Lori. Kunis is a guilty pleasure of mine. She's never really proved to be a particularly strong actress or gotten the chance to experiment with much range (with the exception of BLACK SWAN, I suppose) but she's has a habit popping up in some of my favorite comedies. She's got a great chemistry with Mark Wahlberg and their relationship feels sincere. Wahlberg's the best here. The man can do comedy. He surprised me with his comedy chops opposite Will Ferrell in THE OTHER GUYS in 2010, and TED solidifies the man's talent for making me laugh. I was never really interested in Wahlberg's work until the last few years when he took a turn towards the funny.As good as Wahlberg and Kunis are, the obvious scene-stealer here is going to be the walking, talking teddy bear. The CG work in the movie is absolutely seamless and I never found myself doubting Ted's existence in the context of the movie. MacFarlane voices the bear himself and, despite a Boston accent that cuts a little to close to Peter Griffin (a fact that the movie acknowledges, funnily enough), he's a hilarious new creation that stands above a lot of MacFarlane's television work. No matter how many funny characters cross the screen in TED, the spotlight is always on the bear and for good reason. I would love to see the character get a TV show of his own, but it'd have to be on cable. Network TV wouldn't broadcast half the material coming out of Ted's mouth. TED is one of the funniest movies of 2012, coming in just below 21 JUMP STREET for funniest of the year in my opinion. My only complaint on TED would be that the story is weakly structured. The first two thirds of the movie focus on Ted, John, and Lori's relationship and the final act shifts gears into the realm of action with a chase sequence and kidnapping foreshadowed briefly in the beginning of the movie. If the movie hadn't lost focus and stuck to it's course, it would've been even better.I imagine this will be a pretty divisive movie. People who aren't a fan of MacFarlane's sense of humor probably won't be swayed by the movie, but people like mepeople who continue to enjoy his TV shows, even at their weakest (I'm looking a you 'Cleveland Show')will laugh our heads off.",9,1,6,24 February 2013
Coffee and Cigarettes," A clever, unique film
","This movie was my first exposure to the work of Jim Jarmusch. If his other films are as interesting as this, I will be collecting the rest of them for sure. People who are thinking of watching this movie must realize one thing: it is definitely not for everyone. A lot of people I have spoken to can't stand movies that don't have an relatively easy storyline and a 'twist' ending. This movie is nothing like the mainstream films released on a weekly basis in your local cineplex.There is no singular storyline leading up to some great climax. This film is a collection of eleven shorts featuring celebrities sitting down over a pot of coffee (or tea, in some cases) and chatting. While it doesn't sound like much, this movie is actually more fun than it seems. Jarmusch paired together some celebrities that feel almost like exact opposites. For instance, the slow-speaking, soft-spoken comedian Steven Wright and the hyped-up exuberant Robert Benigni. It did drag during some segments, but never enough for me to lose interest.Everyone is bound to find a segment that they really love in this movie. My personal favorite was the scene between Alfred Molina and Steve Coogan, where Molina gushes like an obsessive fanboy to an indifferent Coogan before the tables are turned. I am sure there is something for everyone in this movie. Unfortunately, I think most people will pass by this movie feeling that it has no point or meaning. The fun of this movie is merely watching the interactions between the people, whether they be amusing, uncomfortable, etc.",8,0,1,28 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," One of the Best Superhero Films
","In the second installment of the Spider-Man saga, Sam Raimi brings us one of the best comic book/superhero movies ever. I still remember how blown away I was after watching this movie in theaters after it's initial release. The action, the story, the special/visual effects...everything was spectacular and came together to create an awesome ride. Two years after the events of the first film, Peter Parker is struggling to balance his real life with his role as Spider-Man. He's unable to keep a job, failing his college courses, and ruining his friendship with longtime love Mary Jane Watson; on top of all that, his best friend obsesses over Spider-Man's role in the death of his father. Meanwhile, an experiment to create fusion by nuclear physicist Otto Octavius leaves him with four metal tentacles welded to his body and an insane desire to recreate the dangerous experiment, risking the lives of half of New York City.Where do I begin? I absolutely loved this movie. The first movie was a great film as well, but it's sequel seemed to take everything a step farther. I felt the story was better in this installment; it manages to fit in so much development but never feels overwhelming and without losing the audience in too much plot. The film concentrates on Peter's personal troubles just as much as it does the Doc Ock storyline. In fact, Doc Ock's transformation doesn't even occur until nearly 40 minutes into the film, but with so much else to absorb, it doesn't hurt the film. And once Doc Ock emerges, the movie only gets better from there with great battles and memorable moments. The hospital scene in which Doc Ock awakens is probably the best scene in the movie (and oozes with Raimi's style) and the battles between hero and villain are some of the best superhero battles created for film.Alfred Molina and the actual character of Doc Ock ranks as one of my top favorite villain performances. Raimi made Octavius and sympathetic character in the film, rather than completely evil, and Molina was a perfect fit for the role. While I was a huge fan of Willem Dafoe and his Green Goblin in the first film, I feel Molina and Doc Ock have topped him. We also get great returning performances from the key players: Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Harris, and Simmons. You can tell they've all become comfortable with the roles at this point and are grasping their characters even better than before. We're also introduced to Mr. Ditkovich (Elya Baskin), Peter's landlord, who injects some humor into the story.As you can see from my rambling, I was a huge fan of this movie and, as much as I've seen it, it never gets old. While it's not the greatest comic book adaptation out there, it definitely ranks with the best. Director Sam Raimi proves that he was meant for this franchise, embracing it and improving with the sequel.",9,3,3,10 September 2008
127 Hours," James Franco's Best Performance
","Movies that are anchored in a single location (in this case, a canyon in Utah) appeal to me. I love the idea that movies of this nature rely on the talent of the performer and not so much on action, special effects, etc. Celebrated filmmaker Danny Boyle adapts the true life story of adventurous outdoorsman Aron Ralston. Ralston has been quoted in regards to the accuracy of the film as saying it's as close as you can get to a documentary while still being a narrative film. Ralston is known for a disastrous adventure into the canyons of Utah in which he was doing some hiking and, after a nasty fall, found himself trapped with a boulder pinning his arm to the canyon wall. For the following couple of days, Ralston documented his experience with his small video camera and survived on what little food he'd brought and a dwindling water supply. The end of the film has become famous for the extreme lengths Ralston had gone to to free himself from the canyon. I'm sure everyone knows how the film ends by this point, but in the event that someone reading this is oblivious, I'll avoid mentioning it. Needless to say, it's pretty painful to watch.Before 127 HOURS, I'd only known actor James Franco as Harry Osborn from Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy and a spaced-out pot dealer in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I was more than a little skeptical that Franco, who I hadn't seen in any serious sort of role, could pull off carrying a dramatic picture by himself. But I suppose I should've given director Danny Boyle the benefit of the doubt that he knew what he was doing. Franco does a great job. He's a talented man, and his work in 127 HOURS proves it. Over the course of Ralston's time trapped in the canyon, Franco runs the gamut from determined and hopeful to ready for the inevitable and he does such a fine job that he brings the audience along with him. Ralston's constant updates into his camcorder give us some insight into what he's going through, seeing as how he has no one to talk to. Franco is powerful as he reaches out to his parents whom he knows won't receive his message until after he's found (most likely too late). He reminisces back to mistakes he's made and moments he regrets, his entrapment giving him a new view on life.Now yes, Danny Boyle is a great director but I know what's most likely to be the bigger selling point for the film is the final act in which Ralston gets down to business when he realizes what he's going to need to do to survive his predicament. Even those who've been desensitized to violence might have a hard time not flinching. It's not overdone and a lot of it is done off screen, but it's done incredibly well and has the audience grimacing. Keep in mind, this even doesn't happen until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. So if it's your sole reason for inquiring into the film, you'll want to get comfortable and settle in for one of the best movies of 2010 in the meantime.",9,0,1,21 August 2011
"I Love You, Man"," The Bromantic Comedy at it's Best
","I was a fan of Paul Rudd from what I'd seen of him in supporting roles but I was leery to see if he could pull off leading status (this was before I'd seen ROLE MODELS). I knew Jason Segel was good for it from the hilarious FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL and had no worries on his part. Thankfully, when I originally caught this movie in theaters, I was more than satisfied. For those not familiar, the film throws a twist on the over-played romantic comedy, twisting the plot into what's been dubbed a 'bro-mantic' comedy. Rudd is Peter Klaven, a man who finds himself newly engaged but, having no close male friends, has no Best Man. So, he goes on the hunt, engaging in 'man-dates' to find the dude to stand by his side for his big event. He comes across Sydney Fife (Segel) and his problems appear solved until his new friendship begins affecting his relationship.Being that this film is a comedy, the important question is: 'Is it funny?' The answer: very much yes. It turns the concept of a romantic comedy upside-down with the idea of a man searching for a best friend, though all the usual elements are recognizable. The casting is superb. I enjoyed Paul Rudd in this film and he's proved he's got leading star material but I'll admit, his character was so awkward at points that I was embarrassed for him, hah. You can't help but sympathize with a guy who's desperate to find a friend and makes a fool of himself trying to appear cool. Segel was hilarious as Fife, the laid-back 'manly man', and was a total scene-stealer. Just as impressive as the main cast were the supporters: Thomas Lennon, J.K. Simmons, Andy Samberg, Jon Favreau, Lou Ferrigno...it seems as if the casting department went out of their way to reel in the high-quality comedy.There are times when the plot becomes a bit predictable, but what do you expect? We've seen the plot a million times before. It's the comedic starpower and clever writing that help this funny gem stand out from its predecessors. It's also got plenty of Rush for those classic rock fans out there. This movie is a romantic comedy for men, one we can stomach and be ensured that we'll get plenty of laughs. And yes, it even has a few of those touching moments to keep it authentic. I'd have to rank this movie as one of the funniest of 2009; give it a shot.",8,0,1,12 September 2009
Batman Returns," Tim Burton Returns to Gotham
","Tim Burton's second adventure in Gotham City is another impressive film, but it doesn't seem to carry the same weight as the original. I loved that he brought back Michael Keaton and Michael Gough, and the casting for the film's new villains were well-thought, but the film had a couple flaws that weakened the overall experience in my opinion. In the second adventure, it's Christmas-time in Gotham and the city has been plagued with sightings of a mysterious Pengiun-man from the sewers. The Penguin soon reveals himself to the citizens and, with support from local corrupt businessman Max Shreck, begins a bid for mayor of the city. Meanwhile, Shreck's meek secretary Selina Kyle adopts the persona of Catwoman when a near-death experience spurs her into action to change her life and bring down those who've made her miserable.Just as in the first film, the casting and production design are the greatest parts of the movie. Michael Keaton continues to prove he was a great choice for Bruce Wayne/Batman, though it seems we don't get nearly as much of him in the film this time around. With two villains to explore (three, if you include Shreck), Bruce loses a good deal of screen time to developing the new characters. This is my primary complaint with all comic-based films that attempt to include multiple villains: you spend so much time building up and introducing these new characters that it bogs down the story and it feels uneven. The primary focus of the film is the Penguin and his plot to become mayor (and an additional evil plan involving Gotham's children that he prepares for throughout the movie and watches it fall apart in less than a minute of screen time). Danny DeVito was absolutely perfect as the Penguin and he is what really makes this film enjoyable for me. Michelle Pfeiffer makes a hot Catwoman, but she ends up playing second fiddle to Penguin; still, she's given enough development in her scenes to make a tragic character who's torn between her two lifestyles. Corrupt CEO Max Shreck is played by Christopher Walken, and we all know that man can do no wrong.The film's weaknesses come in the form of the the execution of the story. While BATMAN managed to avoid it for the most part, BATMAN RETURNS jumps right in with a bit of camp I'd hoped we'd left in the past: themed henchmen. Right from the start, we're exposed to Penguin's thugs...the Red Triangle Circus gang. So, to match Penguin's circus sideshow vibe, we have henchmen ranging from the organ grinder with the monkey to the ringmaster. It reeked of the corniness of the 1960's series and put a damper on the noir feeling evoked by the first film. There are also plot holes that I can't help but nitpick each time I watch the movie, such as how Penguin and his crew got ahold of such detailed plans for the Batmobile for their plan to blackmail the hero. And, since I'm on the topic of camp, I found it hard to suspend my belief for the Penguin's final plan (his 'army'). Seriously...did the franchise need to resort to something so corny so soon?Despite it's descent into the camp of the 60s that paved the way for the Schumacher sequels to take it too far, I don't hate this film. I love the characters enough to forgive some plot issues and, while it isn't as strong as the first, it's still a great Batman film. I would've been interested to see where Burton would've wanted to take the series from here but I'm glad he got out before the series too a turn for the worse (BATMAN AND ROBIN, anyone?).",7,0,0,21 February 2010
Blade," First Great Marvel Movie
","Before Bryan Singer came along and blew our minds with X-MEN or Sam Raimi wow'd us with SPIDER-MAN, director Stephen Norrington created one of the first good Marvel comic adaptations with BLADE. The series follows the half-human/half-vampire Blade in his on-going battle against the undead with the aid of his mentor Whistler. In the film, Blade confronts Deacon Frost, a vampire who's become fed up with his people's desire to remain in the shadows of humanity. He plans to summon the vampire blood god La Magra and allow vampires to rise to their rightful place over the humans. BLADE is Norrington's first major directing gig and he brings us a killer action/horror film to debut one of Marvel's coolest characters.With few exceptions, the casting in this film was terrific. Wesley Snipes truly is Blade; I can't think of any other actor that would've personified the character anywhere as well as Snipes did. He's got the cool demeanor, hint of humor, and wicked martial arts skills to bring to the role. Kris Kristofferson's gruff attitude was an inspired choice for Whistler and Stephen Dorff was fun as Frost. The character of Frost reminded me a lot of Kiefer Sutherland in 1987's THE LOST BOYS which probably made me a bit biased because of how fun a movie it was. Dorff was equal parts crazy, arrogant, and evil: all the best qualities in a comic villain (especially a vampire comic villain).The action in this movie is awesome, with plenty of martial arts (all vampires know martial arts?) and slicing/dicing. Blade's got a nifty arsenal of toys at his disposal, including his glaive, his sword, and a compound called EDTA that had been cooked up by his hematologist associate Karen Jenson (N'Bushe Wright). The EDTA makes for some gory endings for a couple of vampires that cross Blade's warpath. The film's weakness comes in the form of the CG, which has not aged well. Nearly all the CG in the film stands out and pulls you right out of the movie, especially the wraiths in the La Magra summoning scene. I don't know if it was a lack of funds or time but the visual effects still needed a great deal of work.",8,0,1,2 April 2010
Superbad," Who cares if it's vulgar? This movie was awesome!
","Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg bring us one of the funniest teen comedies in years. Yet another Judd Apatow produced film with the usual cast and crew providing us with one of the funniest movies of 2007. Seth (Jonah Hill) and Evan (Michael Cera) are best friends on the verge of graduating high school and they are given the opportunity to gain some popularity AND score with the girls they've adored for years...all they need to do is supply the booze for Jules's (Emma Stone) graduation party. The movie plays out over the course of one night as they try to score the alcohol by any means possible while everything that could go wrong, does.This movie is hilarious! I've been a fan of Apatow and crew since their first feature and now we have a film co-written by one of the funniest actors in modern Hollywood (in my opinion), Seth Rogen. For the sensitive types out there, do yourself a favor and find entertainment elsewhere because this movie is definitely vulgar (though not to my desensitized mind). Curse words and sexual comments pretty much fill the nearly two hour running time (if you have the extended edition, which I recommend). Despite the excessive vulgarity, you can tell the movie doesn't rely on it for its comedy. There are a LOT of genuinely funny moments in this film and that's mostly due to the performances.This film gathers a lot of great comedic talent in one place. I haven't seen much of Jonah Hill before but I thought he was great in the role of Seth, and Michael Cera subdued comedy was a perfect counter to Jonah's loud, angry rants. Christopher Mintz-Plasse makes his film debut as Fogell (aka McLovin) and his scenes are some of the best in the movie. As soon as he's joined by Seth Rogen and Bill Hader as the cops who pick him up, the McLovin subplot almost becomes it's own movie and you wish there was more. I would seriously love to see this group come together for another film (though not necessarily a sequel to this movie). Great comedic performances, a perfect cast, and a raunchy teenage sex story (with some heart, though some wouldn't believe it) come together to once again prove that Apatow and crew are on top of the Hollywood comedy scene.",8,0,2,19 August 2008
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Fox Botches Another Marvel Adaptation
","All right. Seriously, 20th Century Fox needs to throw in the towel and give up on comic book movies. The X-MEN trilogy had a decent run (and X2 is one of my favorite comic adaptations) but every other attempt has ended in mediocrity or failure. Their WOLVERINE spin-off is no different; it teeters on the edge of both. The movie attempts to fill in film audiences on the history of everyone's favorite member of the X-Men, including how he acquired his adamantium claws and his amnesia. Somehow, that equates to an uninteresting story with the usual Fox mutant cameo-fest. When will they learn? I've read a bit of Wolverine's origin story in the comics and was a bit upset that they crammed his childhood into a four-minute opening sequence. They've also taken some annoying creative license with the details of Weapon X and Wolverine's team members, about which I wasn't too thrilled. Lack of faith to the source material aside, I can still enjoy a comic book movie as long as it's entertaining enough. Sadly, this movie didn't fit the bill. The story was unimpressive and never really grabbed me and some of the plot devices were just ridiculous (adamantium bullets...really?!). As has become the norm, Fox included an abundance of unjustifiable character cameos, just for the sake of having them: Gambit, Cyclops, Blob, etc. None of these characters were necessary but they felt the need to include them anyway, which I feel detracts from the story.Performance-wise, the film is hit-or-miss. Jackman did a great job as usual in the title role; he really appears to have embraced the character and I wish they'd given him better material to work with. I absolutely LOVED Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed/Sabretooth! I feel as if he did a better job of making a solid character of him than Tyler Mane did in the original film. As pointless as I felt the character's inclusion was, I felt Taylor Kitsch did a good job in the role of Gambit and I'm hoping he gets some stronger material in the future and a chance to develop the role. Danny Huston was decent as General Styker though I still prefer Brian Cox. And, of course, there's Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool; he always would've been my first choice for the character and he does a great job for the measly 5 minutes we get of him.For a blockbuster movie that came out nine years since the original, I have to question the poor CGI. There are too many moments in this movie when it just looked terrible and pulled you out of the film. Come on now, Wolverine's been in three previous movies...we STILL haven't perfected his claws?! Honestly, the lame outweighs the good for the first X-Men spin-off and it doesn't bode well for the future. The 107 minute runtime feels as if it takes forever and the movie frequently grinds to a halt. With as much bank as the film pulled in, a sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope they learn from their mistakes and Wolverine's next solo outing does the character, and Marvel, justice.",5,5,11,21 September 2009
Constantine," Another underrated comic book film...
","It seems like 'Constantine' didn't get much attention when it was in theaters. Personally, I really enjoyed it. The best way I could describe the feel of the movie to those curious to see it is that it's sort of like the Matrix movies, but with angels and demons instead of machines. The movie is based on the 'Hellblazer' comic book series, featuring John Constantine. With his power to see demons and angels as they interact on Earth, he attempts to keep the balance between good and evil.The most interesting aspect of this movie for me was the storyline. While I am an agnostic, I've always been curious about religious mythology, and this movie plays heavily on just that. It has an entire history regarding God, the Devil, and mankind's role in existence. I enjoyed the backstory almost as much as I enjoyed the film's plot. One of the coolest visuals in the film is it's envisioning of Hell. At some points in the movie, we are given the opportunity to view Hell. It is a fantastic landscape mirroring what exists on Earth, except distorted. The film's creators took the look of Hell from the moment during an atomic bomb detonation between the heat blast and the shockwave. It is really something that must be seen, I was really impressed.The theology and impressive visuals aren't the only thing to enjoy in this movie. Reeves gives his usual performance, perfectly suited for the role of the callous Constantine. I can't think of much to say about Rachel Weisz, as it seems I love her in any role she plays. The most entertaining performance to watch for comes in the form of Peter Stormare as Satan. The man just seems to ooze with evil.I think this movie is generally a hit or miss. Either you like it or you don't really care. It does seem a drag at points and that may turn people off, but I think overall the film has more highlights than low points.",7,1,3,2 February 2006
Spotlight," Engrossing Procedural Drama on the Catholic Abuse Scandal
","I had no real interest in SPOTLIGHT. I wasn't even really aware of it until it won the Academy Award for Best Picture. I have been making more of an effort to watch the Best Picture nominees over the past few years because I figure I needed more exposure to whatever Hollywood considered the crème de la crème of the year's releases. Plus it's a nice break from the summer blockbusters and occasional indie film my local stores decide to keep on hand. Now that I've seen SPOTLIGHT, I can vouch that it's a fantastically interesting movie. I don't know that I would've gone so far as to award it Best Picture at the biggest of movie award shows, especially over some of the other options, but it's certainly good. It's the story of the Spotlight team, a small crew of investigative journalists at the Boston Globe, and how they ran the article exposing years of child sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic priests and, more importantly, how the Church was aware and actively covered it up in a massive conspiracy. Based on the true story, it begins with a new editor assuming command of the Globe in 2001 and requesting that the Spotlight team run a follow-up on the case of a local Boston priest who'd been busted as a pedophile. The reporters quickly discover that this situation is far more extensive and disturbing than anticipated, and they drive forward to see just how deep this scandal goes.SPOTLIGHT is a talking-heads movie. Scene to scene, it goes from one conversation to another. Each scene delivers another tidbit of information or dramatizes the struggle to get confirmation from sources. We're watching two people chat in an office, then a handful of people in a boardroom, and then two people in a diner. What I'm saying is that SPOTLIGHT isn't exactly visually stimulating. It's a two-hour procedural that would've been just as at home serving as a (high quality) two-part episode on some primetime network drama. This is a movie about the importance of the story it's recapping and the performances that bring it to life. I was not raised religious and my family certainly wasn't Catholic so I never had one of those 'It could've been me' moments that really drive the point home, but this is a powerfully told story that really emphasizes the plight of the victims. As the movie unfolds, the team makes contact with more and more victims who reluctantly share stories they've never told anyone. It's heartbreaking, all the more so because it's true. The more the Spotlight team uncovers, the more we learn of the scandal, the more engaged I became in the film. SPOTLIGHT is a talking-heads movie in which I found it impossible to be bored. By the time the film ends on those final title cards that remind us which cities have noted priest abuse scandals, I was at terrified of the scope and proud of the reporters' accomplishments.As is usually the case for films of this caliber, it's loaded with talent. Kudos to Michael Keaton for being involved in the Best Picture winner two years in a row with this and last year's amazing BIRDMAN. Keaton portrays the Spotlight team's editor, Robby. He's joined by Mark Ruffalo, Rachel McAdams, and Brian d'Arcy James in filling out the team. The new editor in charge of the Globe, Marty Baron, is played to low-key perfection by Liev Schreiber and the team's primary point of contact on the priest investigation is a small-time lawyer processing multiple suits against the Church played by Stanley Tucci. Top notch all around. So no matter what's going on, you're getting a performance that, were it not part of an ensemble piece, probably would've garnered more accolades. Writer/director Tom McCarthy packs an enormous amount of drama into these two hours and it's mesmerizing to watch the Spotlight crew but heads with the powerful elite. Boston, as I've discovered, is a very Catholic city and the concept of taking on the Church in such a location meant a lot of pressurenot just from the local religious figureheads, but from the residents themselves. Oh, there you go: it's a David vs. Goliath scenario. See, I managed to shoehorn a religious analogy in there. Anyway, go watch SPOTLIGHT. It deserved to be a top contender (perhaps not a winner) of the year and it's most exciting film you'll watch where the weapons are notepads, pens, and tape recorders.",9,0,0,4 November 2016
Terminator Salvation," Less Disappointing than RISE OF THE MACHINES
","After revisiting McG's venture into the war against machines, I find I may have been a little too harsh on TERMINATOR SALVATION. I was pretty brutal in my discussions with friends on the movie, but now it doesn't seem nearly as bad. Maybe it's because I've also rewatched WOLVERINE and TRANSFORMERS 2 and realized this wasn't even close to be the worst movie of 2009. In fact, as long as you're just looking for a good action film, this does it's job and manages to entertain (albeit, brainlessly). Continuing the canon of the first three films, the movie finds John Connor (Christian Bale) rising through the ranks of the resistance against the machines, though there are still many doubters toward his 'prophet' status. Meanwhile, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) reawakens after 15 years to discover there's been some major changes, to himself and to society. Together, Connor and Wright must cooperate if they want to rescue a young Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) from Skynet before they can alter Connor's history.As is generally the case with the TERMINATOR franchise, the plot isn't too complicated. In this film, the real stars are the special effects and CGI. Being that the film occurs during the war with Skynet, we're treated to a nice collection of new machines, ranging from the snakelike Hydrobots to the massive Harvester, and of course the T-800s (fresh off the factory line). The effects were incredible and the money was obviously well spent in bringing the war to life. The variety of killer machines make for some great action pieces, particularly Connor's climactic battle against a familiar face. Focus on the action spectacles in the film and I doubt you'll find yourself disappointed in the end.Christian Bale continues to prove he's got box office power, especially in the summer, as he adds another iconic character to his resume as John Connor. He isn't given much to work with, and he spends the majority of the movie growling, grumbling, or yelling but he's still a welcome addition. Sam Worthington does a fine job and I'm pretty sure, if the trailers hadn't ruined his character's major development before the movie was ever released, his performance would've been that much more impressive as it left the audience wondering 'is he or isn't he?' before his big reveal in the second act. Rounding out the cast are some shallow, but decent enough supporting performances from Bryce Dallas Howard (replacing Claire Danes in the role as Kate Brewster), Moon Bloodgood being that perfect mix of tough/beautiful as a fighter pilot, and Anton Yelchin who, while he's been in some major roles in STAR TREK and TERMINATOR, still needs some time to grow on me.In all honestly, this isn't as terrible a movie as it's been made out to be. It's gotten a pretty bad reputation and it bombed at the box office, but as long as you don't go into the film taking it seriously (the plot holes won't let you), you can still find enough entertainment value. If nothing else, at least we can take solace in the fact that it wasn't as lame as TERMINATOR 3.",7,1,3,8 December 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Convoluted Last Stand for the Pirates Still Entertains
","I was more excited to see this PIRATES film than either of the previous when it arrived in theaters. The second film had left the series with an awesome cliff-hanger and I was desperate for resolution: Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company has found himself in possession of Davy Jones' heart and now controls the Flying Dutchman, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) had just been eaten by the Kraken, and the remaining pirates were about to embark on a mission to bring their captain back from Davy Jones' Locker with a little help from one of my favorite characters of the series...Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It's the conclusion to the PIRATES franchise and so now it's time to tie up all loose ends, and there sure is a lot of them.One of the primary complaints about this film is that it's entirely way to complex. I can't understand that complaint, and almost agree with it. At this point in the series, there are so many double and triple-crosses that it becomes almost a chore to keep up with it all. Upon seeing the film a few times, I've gotten a good grasp of it all and can now appreciate the depth the writers, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, managed to work into their trilogy. That's not to say the story's perfect, as there are a couple aspects I couldn't help but roll my eyes at. Jack Sparrow says it best in regards to the position of captain, 'They're giving the bloody title away now.' If you've seen the film, you'll know what I mean, as the characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are elevated to unnecessary proportions. Throughout the series, I've never really cared much about Will, and Elizabeth was a fine supporting character but my attention was always drawn to Sparrow, Barbossa, and Jones. We now have all three of my favorite characters in the same film and the focus seems to shift to Elizabeth and Will.Despite this attention shift, the movie is still great entertainment. My favorite segment would have to be Sparrow's imprisonment in the Locker, in which he finds his personality each represented by another Sparrow and together they hopelessly crew a a grounded Pearl. I also enjoyed the sequence in which we are given a chance to view the Brethren Court of Pirate Lords and the colorful characters that populate the seas. Top it all off with an incredible final battle in the raging seas of a maelstrom and you've got some great fun. Depp, Rush, Naomie Harris (as Tia Dalma), and Bill Nighy (as Davy Jones) are worth seeing this film alone but it's also got the usual collection of talented supporting players. Seeing as how the film is complicated for first-time viewers and can be a challenge to watch at a (quick-paced) 2.5 hours, I wouldn't say this film is better than DEAD MAN'S CHEST but it's still a worthy addition to the series and a fine bit of closure.",8,0,1,21 October 2009
X-Men," Good? Yes. Uncanny? Not so much...
","I have never been more excited to see a movie than when I first heard that they were going to release a film based on my favorite comic book characters, the X-Men. I remember I watched the trailer online twice a day for the last two weeks before its nationwide release. I was there opening night with my friends and was blown away. They brought these fantastic characters to the big screen, and they did it well. And it was this movie that opened the floodgates for more comic book movies to come forth.One thing I had to overcome when watching the movie was that it's not the X-Men as I know them, per se. They're a Bryan Singer-ized version. Keep in mind, that's not entirely a bad thing. Singer and the writers kept a majority of the comic intact when translating it to film, but there are differences. If you can look past some inconsistencies, as with any book-to-movie conversion, then the movie is definitely good fun. The visual effects were spectacular, from Wolverine's claws to Cyclops's optic blasts, and the fight scenes were great. The cast is near perfect and some seem born for the roles (i.e. Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier or Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto).I don't really have too much that bothered me about the movie (aside from the minor changes mentioned above). I thought the majority of the movie was too dark (I'm referring to light, not subject matter). There were a lot of scenes at night or in dimly-lit rooms/caves and I felt like it gave the movie a very heavy, serious feel. While I believe the movie should be serious, I also think that it should have some more exuberant lighting to keep with that extraordinary, comic-feel (Note, I said 'extraordinary', not 'over-the-top' or 'campy'). The X-Men may tackle some serious subject matter at times, but they still had their lighter moments.My only other problem was that it felt the movie tended to drag on, despite it's short running time (barely 100 minutes). It seemed at times as if the story was slowing down to a crawl. Another action sequence may have given it the kick it needs to keep its pace, but the movie never fully stalls. It stills keeps you engaged until the finale.Overall, Bryan Singer did a good job. This is an awesome way to kick off the X-Men franchise and open the doors for future comic book-based films. I was completely satisfied when I walked out of the theater in 2000 and I'm still satisfied when I watch it today. Now that Singer has a feel for the characters and actors, things will only get better as the X-Men continue into the future.",7,0,1,11 September 2007
Spider-Man 3," What happened?! How did the franchise fall so far?!
","The first Spider-Man film was great fun and ground-breaking in the world of superhero films for Marvel. The second film is still one of my favorite comic book adaptations. So, how do we go from two awesome films to this?! I was beyond disappointed by the third film in the Spider-Man franchise, and I realize I'm not the only one. In this installment, life is finally going well for Peter Parker...Spider-Man is a celebrity in New York City, he's doing well in school, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane Watson. Everything begins to fall apart when Harry (who is now aware of Peter's alter ego) becomes the 'New Goblin' to destroy Spider-Man, Mary Jane's career begins a downward spiral, and the police admit to Peter that the man who really killed his uncle has escaped from prison. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg. I realize that sounds like a lot to fit into a single film, and it IS.One of the most admirable aspects of Raimi's Spider-Man films is his ability to balance story with action. A lot of superhero films tend to lean towards one over the other but Raimi had managed to find the perfect balance between the two. Somewhere between the second and third film, he lost the ability. The movie feels as if it's all exposition, with a few action sequences thrown in. Granted, the action sequences in the film are amazing, just as they'd been in the first two. It just feels as if it's forever between them. As for the exposition, it wouldn't be so bad if Raimi wasn't trying to fit so much story into a single film; I personally feel this movie would've been better if split into two parts. There are at least two love triangles, three villains, the black suit/symbiote, the introduction of a handful of new characters...the list goes on. As a result, each of these aspects feels under-developed and some even feel wasted (Poor Venom...). Bouncing around between so many subplots gives the movie a disjointed feeling throughout.In addition to the story problems, we get a movie filled with some 'what in the world were they thinking?' moments. I'm sure you've heard about these moments in countless other discussions of the movie: the symbiote giving Peter Parker an emo/goth-style, the Peter Parker jazz club dance scene (second only to Reed Richards' dance number in the Fantastic 4 sequel when it comes to embarrassing moments in Marvel films), the decision to create the New Goblin's style along the lines of an extreme ninja snowboarder, the decision to use the Venom character (one of THE most popular comic characters/villains) for a mere 40 minutes of the movie, and the Sandman/Spider-Man therapy session. With all of these problems combined, it's easy to see why so many people were disillusioned with the latest film. Has Sam Raimi lost touch with the franchise? I seriously hope not.All of the key players return for the newest film, though I find myself losing faith in them. Tobey Maguire gives his usual great performance in the title role. Kirsten Dunst did the best she could with terrible writing; honestly, Mary Jane had become seriously unlikable in this film due to what I perceived as incredible jealousy against Parker/Spider-Man's newfound fame. James Franco has done well as Harry Osborn in the previous films but this time, I've come to a realization. The man cannot play a villain. He's far from threatening and comes off as a fool in some scenes. His attempts to be sadistic or evil as the New Goblin fall flat (with the exception of the fight scenes). Of all the returning performances in the movie, I think the only ones that didn't degenerate were those of Maguire, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons (who's a riot, as always). The film introduces a handful of new characters to the franchise as well, and most turned out well with what little screen time was given. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were great additions to the cast and I hope to see more of them in the future (well, at least of Church...). Bryce Dallas Howard debuts the character of Gwen Stacy; she did great, but I felt it was sort of late to be bringing in her character from the comics.To make it simple: the third Spider-Man film has it's entertaining moments, but they're scattered through the nearly 2.5 hour runtime. The CGI has continued to evolve and the fight scenes are only getting better. I'm just hoping that this cluttered mess of a film was just a result of Raimi's uncertainty over whether the franchise will continue urging him to fit in as much as possible before it possibly ends. Maybe this was just a fluke and future installments will return to the glory of the first two films.",6,0,1,21 September 2008
The Prestige," Nolan's Exceptional Venture into the World of Magic
","After reinventing the Batman franchise and reminding audiences how awesome they can be when Joel Schumacher isn't involved, director Christopher Nolan took the time to do his own thing. The result was THE PRESTIGE, further proof that Nolan doesn't need a man in a bat costume to prove how awesome a director he is. Nolan is one of the best directors in modern Hollywood for weaving a gripping story with powerful performances from his cast. In THE PRESTIGE, Nolan introduces the audience to the behind-the-scenes world of magic (stage magic, not fantasy magic) with the tale of two rising magicians with an ongoing feud that ultimately consumes both of their lives. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are a couple of magician's assistants/audience plants with aspirations of rising to the top in the world of magic. When a botched escape act ends with the death of Angier's wife, Angier blames Borden and the two part ways as Angier stews with thoughts of vengeance. As Borden goes on to make a name for himself, Angier rages at the thought that Borden be given success after what he'd done and begins a war of escalation as each tries to sabotage the other's acts. The war between the two reaches a new level when Borden debuts a new act called the Transported Man and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secret, eventually turning to infamous scientist Nikola Tesla to harness the power of science in creating his own version.I love Nolan's movies and this one ranks high as one of his best in my opinion. The story keeps you guessing, the performances are strong, and I absolutely love the setting. The film is set in 19th century England and takes us behind the curtain as magicians devise their latest illusions to baffle audiences. That alone would've made this movie worth my interest, but Nolan's tale of vengeance and obsession brings the movie a whole other level. I love a good magic show and a glimpse into the creation/execution of classic illusions secured my interest, while the incorporation of science elements with the use of Tesla as a plot element turns the whole concept of magic on it's head with his invention. By that point in the film, it had started slipping into the realm of science fiction, which sort of derailed it a bit. It made for an interesting final act, but it was asking for a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I'm no scientist but, come on, you don't need to be to realize that Tesla's invention in the film is an impossibility. Until this point in the film, it was grounded firmly in reality without stooping to 'real magic' and the sudden inclusion of this miracle machine, while interesting enough, messes with the feel of the movie. Regardless, the film isn't necessarily about the Transported Man or Tesla, it's about the war between Angier and Borden and in that sense the film is a great success.The story is made powerful by the performances of the two leads: Jackman and Bale. Both men are fantastic actors and create characters that are equal parts sympathetic and detestable. Each one is suffering in their own way: Angier with the death of his wife and Borden with his unwavering commitment to his craft despite how it might affect his personal life. I love that the movie, for a while, leaves the question of who is the film's protagonist hazy. You would believe from the beginning that Angier is the hero, merely seeking retribution for his loss, but later in the film the audience perception shifts and we begin to realize that the Angier's obsession has corrupted him beyond reason and suddenly Borden is the victim. Honestly, each man in the movie engages in acts of violence and cruelty, and neither can really be considered the 'good' guy. I think that's what makes this movie that much more interesting: there is no real hero. Just a couple of incredibly flawed human beings caught up in something that explodes out of proportion, performed to perfection by Jackson and Bale. The supporting cast is loaded with equal talent: Michael Caine as Angier's engineer, Scarlett Johansson as a magician's assistant caught in the middle, David Bowie (!) as Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis as his assistant. The production design in the movie is incredible and the cast is powerful. If it weren't for the bizarre sci-fi turn in the middle of the movie, this movie would be perfect.",9,0,1,29 May 2012
The Terminator," Ah-nold kicking butt, cyborg-style!
","We really did get some of our greatest action movies out of the 1980's. In that decade, where there was action, there was Arnold. This is probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's most iconic film role, that of the unstoppable Terminator. In this science fiction/thriller milestone, the Terminator is a cyborg sent from the year 2029 to kill the mother of the man who would save mankind from the machines. Its a film nearly everyone has seen, so there isn't a whole lot to say about it. It was a great action flick that launched a successful franchise.The special effects are a little dated at this point, but it isn't bad enough to pull you out of the movie. The animatronics and puppets are obvious but cool to watch. While on the topic of 'dated', it is kind of amusing to see this movie take place surrounded by 80's style (that's some BIG hair). The film is loaded with plenty of action but it does slow down a bit after the first half when the audience is treated to the bulk of the movie's exposition. Linda Hamilton is awesome as Sarah Connor, target for termination, and has good on-screen chemistry with Michael Biehn. The only real weak spot (which isn't even really worth mentioning) in the movie was Bill Paxton in the opening as the leader of a punk gang. As minor as his role is, for some reason, he always makes me cringe. For some reason, he just aggravates me in this movie. Of course, he's only on screen for two minutes and his role means near to nothing, so ignore my rant.The movie does have a couple plot holes, but only if you feel like feeding a headache with thoughts of time travel mechanics. Most people don't, so it doesn't matter. The movie is a fun popcorn flick and spawned two sequels. Don't try to make sense of things, sit back, and enjoy nearly two hours of action with 80's flair and some of Arnold's best one-liners!",7,2,4,24 December 2007
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Much Better than the First, IMHO...
","I honestly didn't expect much when I first saw this movie. I was a fan of the first film, though it wasn't anything spectacular and I figured this would be more of the same. Wow, no. This movie was SO much better than the first, in my opinion; it was easily one of my favorite movies from 2008. I'm not saying the first was bad, I just found myself bored a lot easier at times. But this film was just flat-out more entertaining. Hellboy and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense find themselves caught up when an elven prince declares war on the human race and attempts to awaken the invincible Golden Army to aid him.Whereas the first film delved into more occult themes, the sequel is full of fantasy and mythical elements. The film is full of some of the most imaginative creature creations I've seen in years, and most of it was done with animatronics and puppetry with very little reliance on CGI. Wink, the prince's monstrous bodyguard/henchman, was a full-size costume with animatronics and CGI used to enhance it and it was amazing. I was blown away by the Troll Market scene and how much detail went into creating that never-before-seen world of fantasy creatures. When you see some of the amazing creations of Del Toro and his crew, you'll be baffled as to how they managed to do most of it practically (the Angel of Death rocks, BTW).Most of the key cast have returned from the first film...Ron Perlman, Selma Blair (HOT), Doug Jones, and Jeffrey Tambor. The writing was sharper in this film and the cast are better than they were before. I especially liked how Liz Sherman (Blair) was given more to do than sulk in this installment. In addition, the BPRD receive a new agent in the form of Johann Krauss, an ectoplasmic entity in a containment suit voiced by the awesome Seth MacFarlane. For me, Krauss stole every scene he was in and I really dug his introduction to the film series. I definitely hope he's brought back in any future sequels. Also a bit different this time around was the 'villain', Prince Nuada (Luke Goss)...rather than the usual world domination motivation, he is jaded at how his people have been treated by the humans and is determined to retake their 'rightful' place in the world. His intentions are noble in a sense but his methods are severely flawed and he presents Hellboy with views that cause the hero to question his place as a defender of humanity.Seeing as how I've never read the comics, I can't say how faithful the film stays to the Hellboy canon but, as a film-goer, I loved this movie. It was a drastic improvement on the first in my opinion and I really hope Del Toro is given the chance to continue the series in the future with the seeds he planted in this film for ongoing plot-points.",9,13,17,24 November 2008
Cloverfield," 'People need to see this, you know...'
","When I first saw the teaser trailer for this movie in the summer of 2007, I was psyched. The image of the Statue of Liberty's head being tossed across Manhatten to land in the streets was enough to hook me. I had to know what it was that was tearing New York to shreds. When I finally got to see the film in mid-January 2008, I felt it lived up to the months of hype surrounding it. The movie puts a new spin on an old concept: it's your usual monster movie with a giant creature stomping through New York but it's told from the perspective of a group of people caught in the middle.Some people are turned off by this film because it's shot entirely from the perspective of a home video camera carried by one of the characters, Hud (probably my favorite character, played by T.J. Miller). As a result of this odd style, the camera is frequently shaky and sometimes disorienting. People with motion sickness should probably just steer clear (or invest in some Dramamine). For those without inner ear issues, it's worth checking out. The home camera POV places you right in the middle of the action, as if you were running right there with them. We see the destruction and, more importantly, the creature from their perspective. At first, we're only treated to short glimpses of the creature...a tail here, a foot there. As the film progresses, we get to see more and more.I personally thought this movie was awesome (even better once it hit DVD...seems easier to watch on the small screen). The unknown actors that were cast in this movie do a great job, giving you reasons to hope they don't end up creature-fodder. The creature is probably the coolest monster to come out of American cinema in years (and it's tons better than that Godzilla fiasco from the 90's). The somber ending (which I won't go into detail on) leaves you wanting more, though not in a bad way. I just wished the movie was longer; the 85 minute running time flies by. The movie take a little while to get into the meat of the action but it soars by when it finally does.",8,2,4,1 May 2008
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," A Great, Solid Movie for Those with the Patience for it
","You've got to have a bit of patience when settling in to watch TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY. It's not the sort of secret agent/spy film the general public has come to expect; this is no James Bond or Jason Bourne. The movie is based on a novel from John le Carré and depicts a more realistic view on the world of espionage. The action is minimal and the plot is dense. After my first viewing, I had a good grasp on what had gone down but I was still a little confused as to how it all came together. There are a lot of characters to keep tabs on and twists and turns in the story to follow as it leads you to the final reveal. From Swedish director Tomas Alfredson, the movie is a slow-boiler that stars some of the biggest names in British cinema. The movie is set in the midst of the Cold War in 1973 Britain. The head of the British intelligence service, Control, believes there is a mole embedded within the organization's highest ranks but a mission to flush it out ends in failure and Control's forced resignation along with his right-hand man, George Smiley. Control dies soon afterward and information arises that might mean Control was right, and Smiley is asked to return as head of an unofficial investigation and determine which of the remaining heads of MI5 is selling the nation's secrets to the Russians. No explosions, no car chases, just sold storytelling and powerful performances.Right off the bat, this movie will loses a lot of peoples' interest in its execution. This movie is a little more than two hours of talking heads. Information is doled out slowly and gives the chance to try and come to conclusions at the same pace as our hero, George Smiley. The problem, and the film's only weakness in my opinion, is that there is just so much information to track. At the end, I wasn't surprised at the reveal of the mole and I understood his motives and even spotted some of the clues, but I had a rough time getting there on my own. When the movie finally gets to that point, I just readily accept it and try to follow the path a little better in a second viewing when I know what (and who) I'm looking for. Despite its often baffling density, I really did enjoy this movie. It's not often we get an espionage movie that isn't just a series of action scenes and a villain with a grand scheme. These spies use subterfuge and misdirection as their tools. The pace is slow but the story grabs you; it doesn't need expensive effects to entertain its audience. The movie is a bit of a brain teaser and I dig that. And the production design is superb in its recreation of the sights, sounds, and styles of 70's era England. Alfredson and his crew paid amazing attention to detail in their immersion into the era.And the best part of the movie is the cast. Seriously, they have pulled together some of the best for this movie. First and foremost, there is the spectacular Gary Oldman in the film's main role, George Smiley. He was nominated for an Oscar for his role here, and it was deserved. He is a tense man with a lot boiling under his surface while maintaining his cool the entire time. He's the penultimate polite Englishman here and the ultimate professional. His colleagues include Colin Firth, Toby Jones, David Dencik, and Ciarán Hinds. Some receive more attention and screen time than others but all put forth fantastic performances, especially Jones and Firth. The movie also boasts John Hurt (in a limited role as Control), Tom Hardy (in my opinion one of his best performances as a suspected turncoat), Mark Strong, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch, who I'll admit I never heard of before this film, is an integral role in the movie as Smiley's inside man and nails it. This cast really is a collection of some of the best Britain has to offer, and they have to be because the movie rests entirely on their shoulders. I would love to recommend this movie more widely but I can tell right off that the majority of general audiences would be bored to tears. So if you have a bit of patience and love an intricate plot, I certainly recommend this film but be prepared for a second viewing if you want to walk away with a solid understanding of its events.",8,3,4,12 June 2012
The Hateful Eight," Absurdly Violent with Fantastic Over-the-Top Performances
","During production on THE HATEFUL EIGHT, Quentin Tarantino announced plans to retire after he's completed ten films. That is probably the saddest cinematic news I've heard, especially since this marks his eighth film (he counts KILL BILL as one, thankfully) and it means he may only have two more left. Tarantino movies are an event for me. I get more excited for the release of one of his films than any other director or franchise out there. For the first time ever, I was even able to partake in a film's special event coinciding with its release. Roadshows and limited releases generally don't happen too close to my town (unless I feel like driving two hours to Orlando) so when I found out the roadshow cut of THE HATEFUL EIGHT would be playing relatively close, meaning only one hour away, I was ecstatic. I drove out to that theater just late enough to miss the showing I'd aimed for and gladly sat in my car for three hours in the parking lot of that theater (I'd recently been by a bookstore so I had some reading material to keep me sane) until the next showing because it was a Tarantino film. It was worth it. I got the souvenir program issued with the showing, got to enjoy the full experience with the overture, intermission, and additional footage, and I was able to mingle with fellow Tarantino enthusiasts who were just as thrilled to be there. It was a fantastic time.That being said, how was the movie? It was great but it wasn't one of his top tier films; it fails to reach the levels of PULP FICTION, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, or DJANGO UNCHAINED. It has a few pacing issues. Tarantino and cinematographer Robert Richardson were so proud of the gorgeous western landscape footage, covered in snow and shot in beautiful 70mm, that we get long shots of just the landscape at times to let us soak it all in. The story is also a bit thin so there's a lot of padding in the form of long scenes included just to add more flavor to the proceedings, like the characters putting out a guideline between the haberdashery and the outhouse at the onset of the blizzard. We sit on that scene for what feels like an unnecessary amount of time but I don't hate it because it just reinforces the old west atmosphere with a reminder of how rough and inhospitable life could be. None of that matters to me though because it's part of the experience in his films. He's a cinema nut and he loves to have fun with his work; no one's going to tell him what to do or what not to do. He has a vision in mind and he intends on delivering that vision to the audience to share in it with him. It's exactly why people like me drive to a theater farther away, so we can get that full experience when opportune.My quibbles with THE HATEFUL EIGHT are all minor and they're drowned out by pretty much everything else in the film. It's a Tarantino film and you get everything you'd hope and expect to find. Questionable characters. Sharp, often crude or unsettling, dialogue. Larger than life performances. And those strange bombastic genre touches he loves to toss in. The cast is phenomenal and loaded with familiar Tarantino collaborators, with some new ones tossed in. No one really steals the show because everyone is bringing their absolute best and having fun, but if I had to point out the highlights it'd probably be Kurt Russell, Jennifer Jason Leigh, and Walton Goggins. And Demián Bechir as Bob the Mexican. He almost borders on caricature but he steals scenes with his bizarre performance. Honestly, the only person who didn't outright blow me away was Michael Madsen and that's because he was sort of just doing his usual: narrowed eyes, few words, and an obvious threat despite the fact the movie is supposed to be a bit of a mystery as to who can be trusted and who can't. He stands out as a hidden enemy the moment you meet him on screen but it doesn't matter much because no one in this movie can be trusted. Every character trapped in Minnie's Haberdashery has darkness in their past and a real mean streak. The fun is in learning about each of them and watching them interact with each other as the time rolls on and we approach the inevitable breaking point for this tense standoff. This is why THE HATEFUL EIGHT, despite not being Tarantino's strongest film, is almost mesmerizing for me. You sit me down in front of it and I'm not moving until it's over. Tarantino fans will certainly find something to love in THE HATEFUL EIGHT but others might be put off by the pacing, the racial undertones (it's set soon after the end of the Civil War), and the mounds of Tarantino dialogue filling it out before the action explodes. Frankly, I don't care. I'm just excited we get at least two more and remain hopeful he'll rescind his decision to retire so we get Tarantino films for years to come.",8,3,8,4 December 2016
Crash," Thought-Provoking Drama with a Powerful Story...
","I had no idea what this movie was when I first rented it. I had never heard of it. I didn't know who was in it or even what it was about. I just knew that, when I worked at Blockbuster Video, everyone was asking for it when it came out. So, I decided to see what all the hype was about. After I had finished the movie, I was impressed. I thought it definitely lived up to all the talk I had heard. It had a terrific cast with a story that never slowed down. It provided a strong, emotional look at the racism running rampant. We are reminded of how everything we do affects the lives of those around us. One of the aspects I loved about this film was that it inspired thought after the credits began to roll.This movie follows an ensemble cast and has multiple small story lines weaving through it. Don Cheadle and Jennifer Esposito play detectives investigating the murder of a black LAPD officer who was shot by a white colleague. Terrence Howard and Thandie Newton play a couple whose lives are changed after they are pulled over by the police and things go wrong. Brendan Fraser is a DA who, with his wife (Sandra Bullock), is carjacked by Chris 'Ludicrous' Bridges and Larenz Tate. This is only a sampling of the stories involved; each one colliding together in a 24 period.Paul Haggis did a great job with his movie. Each of the case does a spectacular job. I enjoyed watching actors/actresses working roles I had never pictured them in, namely Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser. I wasn't used to seeing them in such serious roles and it was cool to witness the range of their abilities. Ludicrous really surprised me with how well he did in this movie. With so little acting experience, he really seemed to put 100% into his role and did well. There really weren't any weak spots in this film's casting and it would take forever to mention how well they each did.There seem to be a lot of people who really don't like this movie, but I fail to see why. Each of the stories is developed enough to enjoy, despite having so many in one film. The acting is great and the flow of the story keeps from boring its audience. It's emotionally powerful (my wife STILL cries when watching it) and it sends an important message. As I said before, this movie also shows how much people effect each other in their daily lives. This is definitely a 'love it or hate it' movie and I think it's worth giving it a shot to find out where you stand.",9,2,5,22 December 2007
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A great end to a great trilogy...
","It is almost depressing for me to watch 'Return Of The Jedi'. Every time the end credits start rolling, I remember that I have just watched the last of an awesome trilogy of films and the only word that comes to mind is 'Damn'. I have seen this movie countless times (definately more than I have seen any other movie) since I was a kid and it never gets old. I fell in love with the story of the Rebellion overthrowing the Galactic Empire and Luke Skywalker's journey to becoming a Jedi. Fortunately, Lucas delivers an exciting finale to the series equal to 'Star Wars' and 'The Empire Strikes Back'.'Return Of The Jedi' picks up shortly after the last movie left off. Luke Skywalker travels to the planet Tatooine to rescue Han Solo, who has become prisoner to Jabba The Hutt. Meanwhile, the Galactic Empire nears construction on a brand new Death Star. Of course, this makes more sense if you have seen the first two movies (if you haven't, I recommend it). Once again, the entire cast returns and puts in awesome performances. Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, Billy Dee Williams...I couldn't imagine anyone else filling their positions. This cast really helps you care for the characters throughout the movie.Once again, one of my favorite aspects is the film's visuals. This film contains my one of my favorite battle scenes ever put on film. Despite the technology they had to use to create the battles in space in 1983, I still think it looks better, even more realistic, than a lot of the more modern films (including the new trilogy). Stop-motion animation and green screen shooting was all it took to bring this movie to life. Lucas didn't need millions of dollars in CGI backgrounds to make the galaxy feel real to the audience back then.If you haven't been exposed to Lucas's trilogy before, check it out. I would suggest seeing the original trilogy in order, then if you want to, move on to the newest trilogy.",9,0,0,25 May 2005
The Expendables," Stallone's Action Epic, Shallow but Fun
","Sylvester Stallone has written and directed the most testosterone-loaded film in years. He has brought together action film icons, both young and old, into one big exploding mess, and that's the main draw of the whole film. The story itself is nothing special that we haven't seen before: a team of mercenaries are hired by a mysterious 'Agency' to infiltrate a Central American island nation and remove a general and his American benefactor from power. Cue the Expendables into action: Barney Ross (Stallone), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), and Toll Road (Randy Couture). With names like that, you know the focus of this film isn't the characters...it's the explosions.This isn't necessarily a problem. Some movies are just the type where you don't feel like following a story and want to watch Stallone take off a guy's head with one swipe of his knife. The action in this film is pretty wicked, particularly a scene where Ross and Christmas are escaping the island in their cargo plane and Christmas pops out through a front hatch to gun down soldiers from the air. Still, even with creative action moments like this, I don't think this movie pushed the limits enough for me. Sure, it was rated R but it didn't always feel like it. It might've been because the majority of the blood spatter in the film was CGI. Whatever happened to practical effects and blood squibs? It helps give an action film a little extra realism rather than using CGI to create blood that just does not look right in any case. There is some graphic violence in the film, but it's never too crazy (with the exception of Dolph Lundgren's warning shot to a group of Somali pirates in the opening).No worries though because the CG blood isn't enough to ruin the film. It's still a blast, with the mercs trading one-liners while gunning through hundreds of soldiers. The dialogue is cheesy but the action keeps coming and doesn't stop until the Expendables have done their job. I do wish Mickey Rourke had been given a meatier role in the film. I thought he awesome in IRON MAN 2 and was looking forward to seeing him kick some butt here, but he's only given a handful of scenes away from the action. His character, Tool, is one of the most interesting and I hope he has a bigger role in the inevitable sequel (because, let's face it...with $100+ million box office, we're getting another). If Bruce Willis (who has a short, but sweet cameo with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film) has a clear enough schedule, I'm hoping he returns to further inflate the awesomeness of the cast.Stallone had a moment of genius when he decided to bring all of these action icons together and with some minor fixes, he could have a real action masterpiece. He's off to a good start here and I'm hoping the eventual sequel will be even stronger. If you're in the mood for some mindless explosions at the hands of some of the best action heroes to grace the screen, this is it. Just don't look too deep, or you'll see just how shallow the whole ordeal really is.",7,4,7,30 November 2010
Knocked Up," A Profane, Entertaining 'Romantic' Comedy from Apatow & Crew
","Judd Apatow's second feature film doesn't have nearly as much raunchy humor as his first, but injects it with more heartfelt moments to balance it all out. In the film, slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) gets career-minded Alison Scott pregnant after a drunken one-night-stand and the two come together in an attempt to create a relationship out of their situation. I didn't find the film as 'laugh-out-loud' funny as Apatow's first movie, but this was still a great movie in it's own regard. There were points were I felt the length of the movie (the unrated version runs 2 hrs. 13 min.) but I never got bored and I never stopped laughing.One thing you'll find when watching an Apatow film is that he uses a lot of same cast for each film, and I'm glad he does because he's managed to network with some of the funniest performers in modern film. I continue to believe that Seth Rogen is one of the funniest men in entertainment and this movie only strengthens that belief. He's hilarious at all the right times here and gives a sincere performance that helps you like the character, even when he does something stupid (and he does, multiple times). Katherine Heigl is enjoyable and seems like she had a great time in her role, but I couldn't help but lose a bit of respect for her after she complained about the movie following it's release. For me, the best parts of the film involved Ben's friends (Jonah, Jay, Jason, and Martin) or Paul Rudd (who's got great chemistry with Rogen). Whenever these guys were on screen, it cracked me up.As I'd mentioned, this film doesn't come with as much raunchy humor as Apatow's other film, though it still has some. People should not jump into this film expecting the usual romantic comedy because they will be disappointed (and probably shocked). At it's core, the film has a warm-hearted story about a slacker rising to the challenge to become a father-figure for his arriving child. Filling it out are plenty of sexual humor, drug use, and the usual profanity. So, if you think about it, it'd be pretty easy for this film to appeal to both men and women.",8,1,2,7 September 2008
Alien," A Science-Fiction/Horror Masterpiece
","Ridley Scott's science-fiction/horror masterpiece is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. Why can't they make sci-fi/horror movies like this anymore?! A strong story, a claustrophobic atmosphere, a superb cast, and one of the coolest creature creations to come out of Hollywood. It's tough to find someone who hasn't already seen this film and it's harder to find someone who didn't enjoy it. The story revolves around the 7-person crew of the NOSTROMO, a commercial space vessel towing a refinery back to Earth. Halfway home, their journey is interrupted when they receive a possible distress call of unknown origin from a nearby planetoid. A quick investigation leads to some of the most memorable movie moments when their ship is soon terrified by a seemingly unstoppable alien.I first saw this movie on cable when I was around 11-12 years old and I remember the scene with Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) scouring the lower decks in search of Jones (the cat) when he first encounters the full-grown xenomorph alien; that one scene scared the crap out of me and it officially hooked me for life. The entire movie has a cramped feel with set design that gives you the feeling that the creature could pop out from any bulkhead at any moment. Honestly, the set design is probably one of my favorite aspects of this film. Unlike some science fiction films where everything is clean, shiny, stream-lined, etc, Scott's film has a realistic, gritty, lived-in feeling that makes the movie feel more grounded in reality (which makes the danger feel that much more ominous). And you can't mention the design of this film without mentioning the contributions of H. R. Giger; the man is a surrealist genius and this movie would NOT have been the same without his cooperation.The cast of this film did a fantastic job at bringing this film to life. The chemistry between the 7 crew members feels genuine and it's definitely easy to believe these people have been stuck on a spacecraft for years with each other. John Hurt, as the doomed Kane, was great and I can't imagine how different things would've been if the part had gone to Jon Finch as was originally set. Tom Skerritt and Veronica Cartwright both contributed strong performances while the chemistry between Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton made for some great moments. My absolute favorite characters in this film were Ash (played by the ever-awesome Ian Holm) and, of course, the iconic Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver). From the very beginning, you can tell there's more to Ash that what he lets on and Holm does a great job of giving those subtle hints to keep you suspicious of his intent. And Sigourney, well, she just rocks. Ripley has become a film icon as a head-strong, capable, female lead and Weaver was the perfect woman for the role. The animosity between Ripley and Kotto's chief engineer Parker made for some tense moments and she even managed to carry the movie on her own towards the end.And finally, the Alien itself. It is one of the coolest creature designs for a movie ever, courtesy of H. R. Giger. It's sleek, slimy, look with it's trademark extendable inner mouth have made this one of the most memorable monsters to grace the big screen and spawned three direct sequels. Upon watching this movie, it's easy to see what's placed it on the top favored movies of so many people...",10,0,1,6 July 2008
Horrible Bosses," One of the Few Good 2011 Comedies
","Seth Gordon's HORRIBLE BOSSES is a breath of fresh air in a summer that's had a high dose of comedies that failed to get much of a reaction from me. With the exception of BRIDESMAIDS, there really hasn't been much to laugh at in 2011 and I was ecstatic that Gordon's film was a lot funny than the trailers led me to believe. The concept isn't original (and it even plays on that with a mention of THROW MOMMA FROM THE TRAIN from the main characters) but that's to be expected anymore. It's the cast that makes this film so fun. The story centers on three friends: Nick, Dale, and Kurt. Dale slaves endlessly in his office job with hopes of eventually climbing the corporate ladder, unless his megalomaniac boss has anything to say about it. Dale is recently engaged and works as a dental assistant where sexually harassed on a daily basis by the gorgeous dentist he works under. And Kurt has recently come under hard times when his beloved boss has died and left his cokehead son behind to run the company into the ground. When enough is enough, the three hatch a scheme to murder each other's bosses with the aid of 'murder consultant', Motherf***a Jones and it goes about as well as you would expect.The humor in the film is essentially a lot of fast-talk from the main trio (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis) as they chatter over each other in hopes of getting out the better improv'd one-liners. You'll notice most scenes in the movie that feature two or more of them have them stumbling over each other's lines in a constant state of confusion. Still, the humor works. These guys are frightened, confused, and completely in over their heads in a complex murder scheme with only the most basic of advice from MF Jones (Jamie Foxx in a hilarious supporting role) to guide them through. Jason Bateman is always a safe bet for a good dose of funny, and Jason Sudeikis comes from the SNL family of comedy, which could go either way. Sudeikis is on the current SNL lineup and I haven't seen enough later episodes of the show to really form an opinion of him, but he's good here with his overactive libido and utter contempt for his coked-out tool of a boss. The wild card in the film for me was Charlie Day, as I'd never seen much 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia' before this movie came out. Day was probably the funniest part of the movie in my opinion with his manic energy and total naivety. A 'registered sex offender' for the weirdest of reasons, he has to suffer through his boss's advances knowing he won't find work anywhere else.Speaking of the bosses, I don't know a single man who would loathe a job where Jennifer Aniston routinely tried to get in his pants. Aniston completely throws away the sweetheart image she's created from her previous work to be an over-sexed dentist determined on getting herself a piece of Dale. At first it's weird hearing raunchy comedy coming from Aniston, but it works. Kevin Spacey is Nick's boss, David Harken, and let's face it...Spacey's great in any role, especially one where he's on a power trip. It's no surprise that the film works him into the position as the primary antagonist. Finally, there's Colin Farrell as Kurt's boss, Bobby Pellitt. Farrell is over-the-top hilarious in a way that I never would've expected to come from him. I never saw him as a comedy type but he knocks you out here with his crappy comb-over and his shoddy karate kicks. He gets the best lines in the film for what little we get him. It's unfortunate but Farrell gets the least screen-time of all the bosses.HORRIBLE BOSSES isn't going to find itself on many top 10 lists but it's great for some laughs. It's the most entertaining comedy to come out all year and one of the few times I've found myself laughing in the theater. The cast are superb and the antics are fast-paced. I doubt it's going to find any cult status and it may even be forgotten by this time next year but I think it's worth a viewing for those who've found our selection of good 2011 comedies to be slim pickings.",8,1,2,18 November 2011
The Doors," It Made a Fan Out of Me
","Despite it's flaws, I can't help but include Oliver Stone's THE DOORS whenever I'm asked my favorite movies. I knew nothing of the band before seeing the movie and I'd only heard the name Jim Morrison in passing. This film changed all that, as it follows the Doors' formation in Venice Beach, CA in 1966, their rise to fame, and Morrison's plunge into alcoholism and ultimate demise in Paris in 1971. This film turned me into a fan of the band overnight, exposing me to the amazing music and the mystery surrounding one of music's most interesting figureheads.Seeing as how I watched this movie pre-fandom, I was able to view it with a more unbiased eye. Val Kilmer was amazing as Morrison, and I still believe so after having further exposure to Morrison through video and biographies. I can't think of any that could've done a better job portraying Morrison's coy style, erratic behavior, and tortured psyche. Kilmer's vocals were astounding, and often hard to discern from the real Morrison. Meg Ryan was hit-or-miss for me in her role as Pam Courson, Morrison's longtime lover/soulmate. There were points in the film where I felt she did a great job, and others where she didn't quite fit the role. On the other hand, the film is loaded with great performances from Kyle MacLachlan, Kevin Dillon, Frank Whaley, and, my personal favorite cameo...Crispin Glover as Andy Warhol.My only major issue with the film are the liberties Oliver Stone took with the details of Morrison's life. Those who watch this film need to understand that Stone exaggerated a good deal in this movie, tweaked history, and seemed to focus on Morrison's drunken antics rather than the tortured artist or his underlying intelligence (the man was tested at genius level IQ of 149 in grade school). Instead, Morrison is portrayed as a fool and overgrown child. I also wish the movie had given a bit more focus to the group dynamics amongst the band members, but Ray Manzarek, John Densmore, and Robby Krieger are essentially pushed into the background.Regardless, the movie is entertaining. Stone was sure to include many of the important events in the career of the Doors, from their firing at the Whiskey a Go-Go to Jim's legal troubles in New Haven and Miami. It gives you one perspective on the Morrison myth but I urge you not to accept Stone's movie as fact. If you find yourself as big a fan as me after viewing the film, do yourself a favor and read a couple of biographies on Jim. Once you've collected information, you can form your own opinion, but in the meantime, enjoy THE DOORS.",10,5,8,7 November 2009
Black Mass," One of Johnny Depp's Best/Most Grounded Performances
","BLACK MASS is a valuable reminder that Johnny Depp doesn't need a zany costume and wacky mannerisms to perform. I suppose the last time I saw him in a more grounded role was probably THE RUM DIARY from 2011, and that was none too memorable. His performance as Boston mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger is his best in many years. BLACK MASS tells the story of how FBI agent John Connolly (Joel Edgerton) returned to Boston and convinced his superiors that an alliance with south Boston criminal Bulger would be vital in stamping out Italian mob activities in the area. Bulger begins acting as an informant to the FBI, providing useful information to flush out his competition while building his own criminal empire. Meanwhile, Connolly and his co-conspirator John Morris (David Harbour) work within the FBI to hide evidence of Bulger's activities, allowing him to thrive and providing the them a cushier life than is normally afforded government agents. BLACK MASS chronicles James Bulger's rise to power, the violence and murder that defined his reign as one of America's most dangerous criminals, and his eventual downfall when the FBI began to crack down on their internal corruption, sending Bulger on the run. BLACK MASS is a movie that won't leave you feeling too well, as there's hardly an honorable character in the mix and just about everyone is a villain, but it's engrossing in it's depiction of government corruption left to run wild and the shady individuals it allows to thrive.When I first saw BLACK MASS, I found myself frustratingly distracted by two things: Depp's makeup as Bulger and Benedict Cumberbatch's Boston accent. Once you get accustomed to those, this movie is pretty cool. It's adapted from the book of the same name, written by the Boston Globe reporters who broke the story in 1997 about Bulger's association with the FBI. It's a dour portrait of one of America's most infamous gangsters, a man who spent more than a decade on the FBI's Most Wanted list. If Depp's performance is anything to go by, the man was not one to be messed with. With his thinning hair, piercing blue eyes, and predatory nature, Bulger struck fear into anyone unfortunate to have had dealings with him. He's a cold, calculating man with a free ticket for violence and murder to establish his empire thanks to the blind eye turned his way. Johnny Depp, who seems at first a weird choice for the role, knocks it out of the park as Bulger. He plays the man like a shark, calm and collected until he smells blood in the water. Then he snaps and you'd just better hope you're not on the receiving end. Depp's Bulger is the focal point of BLACK MASS so the movie really lives or dies based on his performance, and it's easy to forget the man under that hairpiece and contact lenses is the same man famous for eccentric performances like Jack Sparrow or the creepy Willy Wonka.Depp is supported with a fantastic cast including Edgerton, Harbour, Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Sarsgaard, Jesse Plemons and more. The movie is loaded with serious talent, bringing this story to life. Most of them are nothing more than background dressing, be it Bacon's role as Connolly's FBI superior or Cumberbatch's role as Bulger's brother/Massachusetts senator Billy. Neither does more than serve their limited role in the overall story, but it's great that even the smaller roles were handled with care. The city of Boston is just as much a character in the scope of this movie. Bulger was first and foremost a 'Southie', a man of Irish heritage born and raised in south Boston. The community played a major role in Bulger's life. People knew him and were loyal to him. The movie makes a point to show Bulger's love for his hometown in a moment when he crosses paths with a little old woman from his past and insists on helping her get her groceries home. BLACK MASS tries to pin a human side to the seemingly inhuman gangster with some background into the death of his young (adopted?) son but any humanity he might have seems to fade when the chains are off and Bulger is given the chance to rule Boston's underworld. BLACK MASS is definitely a 'feel-bad' movie but it's a good one. It'll blow your mind what the man was able to get away with but at least the movie closes on a positive note with the reminder that Bulger was eventually brought to justice to serve the rest of his life in prison.",8,0,2,29 October 2016
Shutter Island," Solid Suspense from Scorsese
","Whenever the topic of the best movies of 2010 is brought up, I nearly always forget to mention Martin Scorsese's powerful psychological from February. It's moody, it's atmospheric, and it's carried by a fantastic cast. The story is set in 1954, and U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) has been assigned to investigate an inmate's disappearance at the isolated criminal asylum on Shutter Island. No one saw her escape and her room remained locked...it was as if she'd 'evaporated straight through the walls'. Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis has done an awesome job weaving a suspenseful story that drops enough hints to keep you drawn in until the big reveal at the end of the film.If you can, try to avoid spoilers before seeing this movie. I had the misfortune of having the end ruined for me before I had a chance to see it and it killed a lot of the suspense. I was still entertained but I didn't have as much to look forward to at the end. Despite my pre-existing knowledge of the climax, it was still fun to watch and see how the writer and director managed to weave hints into the story. It's a great twist on the ending but I admit that I still don't grasp how feasible such an ending actually was. Without going into spoiler details here, I'll merely say that I'm still questioning how some of certain aspects of the big 'reveal' worked.2010 was definitely the year of DiCaprio, with powerhouse roles here and in Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION. The man knows how to pick the right projects and continues to impress me with his work. He is supported with great work from Mark Ruffalo, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earl Haley, and Max von Sydow. I really no few complaints with the film, with the exception of the 'what-ifs' left behind with the twist ending and the music's occasional habit of swelling up a bit louder than necessary and drowning out dialogue (particularly in the opening arrival sequence).",9,1,4,3 November 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel Scores with a Brutal, Grounded Comic Film in WINTER SOLDIER
","Marvel scores again with the third film in their Phase II line with CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER. It's especially impressive considering Captain America has personally been the least interesting character in the MCU Avengers. I enjoy the movies (FIRST AVENGER was really good) but the character just doesn't grab my attention in the fantastic way Iron Man, the Hulk, and even Thor have. But after the awesomeness of IRON MAN 3 and the better-than-anticipated THOR: THE DARK WORLD, we're given a new spin on the superhero genre as the latest Captain America adventure has more in common with a political thriller than any of the Marvel films that have come before. This film saw a major shakedown of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as major changes took effect, and it managed to prove that Captain America is a force to be reckoned with all his own. As the movie begins, we find that Captain America)/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has continued working with S.H.I.E.L.D. since the events of THE AVENGERS. A routine hostage extraction puts Rogers at odds with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) over S.H.I.E.L.D. and its habit of withholding information, and the matter intensifies when Fury reveals Project: Insight. Insight finds S.H.I.E.L.D. launching three new helicarriers capable of eliminating hundreds of thousands of enemies in an instant, and Rogers worries about S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plan of maintaining peace through fear tactics. Within hours of the revelation, an assassin is dispatched against Nick Fury, and Rogerswith the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) must turn fugitive when S.H.I.E.L.D. turns its sights on him.With all the bombastic comic films coming to the big screen, it's a concern that we might become oversaturated and burnt-out on the genre. I love that Marvel is finding ways to keep their films feeling fresh. WINTER SOLDIER is easily the least flashy comic film I've seen. It's grounded in reality (as real as a super soldier can be, anyway) and its action is hard-hitting and brutal instead of flashy and spastic. When Captain America goes into action, it's no different than a Bourne or modern Bond film. It's all beat downs and bullet casings. I can also respect that it's the only Marvel film so far without the colorful, grandiose villain. The film's actual villain is a pretty major plot point that I won't spoil (but I figured it out pretty fast) and the Winter Soldier is merely a tool at his or her disposal. Anyone semi-familiar with Marvel canon knows the Winter Soldier's true identity but the movie seems to play it off as a surprise so, again, I won't say anything here in the event someone new to the material might be reading this in hopes of a recommendation. Despite not being as larger-than-life as previous Marvel film villains, the Winter Soldier is one of the coolest. A fellow super-soldier, he's the only man who can go head-to-head with the legendary Captain America and pose a threat. He's a cold-blood murder machine and the enemy's most dangerous weapon.Aside from the Winter Soldier (a fantastic addition to the MCU that I can't wait to explore further), the film also introduces the Falcon. As with the rest of the movie, he's presented in a quasi-realistic fashion. Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) is a military vet spending his time volunteering with those returning from service with PTSD. When Captain America comes along requesting for help, he's all about it, utilizing a piece of experimental flight technology and, boom, a new MCU hero is born. He doesn't get much to do until the final half of the movie but you can tell he's doing to be a popular addition to the franchise. Black Widow gets the expanded role she's been due, Evans continues to prove that there was no better choice to inhabit the red/white/blue costume, and the movie culminates in a franchise-warping revelation that'll switch things up a bit for future movies & television series. Despite its thriller vibe, action fans get plenty to enjoy with an extended sequence in the final act of the film where Captain America and Falcon get time to throw down. My personal favorite moment comes halfway through the film and, despite being a primarily exposition scene, features the return of Arnim Zola (Toby Jones, reprising the role from the first film). It doesn't quite feel like a Marvel film but there's plenty here to remind you that this movie does in fact take place in a universe that's still recovering from an alien invasion. CAPTAIN America: WINTER SOLDIER is the least comic book-ish of Marvel's film stable but that adds to its appeal, and I imagine that makes this film the most easily accessible film for those who aren't necessarily in the market for a grandiose superhero movie.",8,0,0,12 February 2015
Life of Pi," A Visually Stunning Tale of One Boy's Faith
","Once I watched this movie, it was impossible to shake from my mind for almost three days after. Each time I've watched it, it's left me in awe. LIFE OF PI is a beautiful film with a magnificent story to tell. From Ang Lee (director of HULKthe one with the gamma poodle yeah, I went there), LIFE OF PI is based on a novel from Yann Martel that, admittedly, I've never read. It is, without a doubt, one of the most (if not, THE most) visually stunning movie of 2013 and the story is one that just stirs around in your head, leaving you to think back on what you've watched and question everything about it. The premise of the story is what originally hooked my attention: a young Indian boy is adrift at sea, trapped aboard a life boat with a Bengal tiger. More specifically, the boy is Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma) and he was raised in India with his family in their zoo. When times become tough and the zoo must close, his family loads the animals aboard a freighter and they set off for Canada. A storm leaves Pi alone on the Pacific Ocean, a lone survivor from a shipwreck, with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger along for the ride. LIFE OF PI is a tale of faith and survival that might, as an adult Pi describes as he recounts his tale to an interested author, 'make you believe in God.' Ultimate belief in a deity is not guaranteed, but an incredible story with mind-blowing effects is.So, for a little context from this commenter, I am not religious or spiritual in any real sense. You don't necessarily need to be in order to enjoy this movie. This is not a movie to preach religious faith or drive home points about how belief in God is important or whatever. This is one man's account of a life-changing event in his life and how (and more importantly why) it strengthened his belief in God. The character of Pi Patel is more than your average Hindu. He's Hindu, Christian, and Muslim with a possible bit of Jewish mixed in. He's a boy who loves God in all his forms and his faith will be put to the test over the course of this two-hour film as he is trapped in the middle of the largest ocean in a lifeboat with a tiger. As if survival isn't difficult enough when you're trapped thousands of miles from anywhere with limited food and clean water, but a hungry carnivorous cat tends to exacerbate problems. Pi will face hunger, weather, and his fellow passengers in his long quest across the ocean while maintaining his faith that his God (of many faces) is watching over him. And in the end, when Pi returns to society and gives us (and two Japanese insurance adjustors) a second version of his tale, we are introduced to a new understanding behind faith in a higher power and what leads people into it. As a firmly non-religious person, I actually thought it was one of the most enlightening descriptions of religious faith I've heard. And it's all done without being preachy.LIFE OF PI is, as you've probably heard just about any time the movie is discussed, an amazing visual feast. I don't like to use the term because I think it comes across as corny, but I'll make a rare exception for LIFE OF PI: it is stunning. Ang Lee, cinematographer Claudio Miranda, and the visual effects team have created a gorgeous film. It's not often you see a movie of this caliber anymore. LIFE OF PI is a prime example of film as art, as opposed to summer blockbusters or cash-grab sequels. The visual effects in this movie are superb but you might not think so when watching it. It wasn't until after I'd seen the movie twice that I discover that the majority of scenes with Richard Parker, the tiger, are a CG animal. In fact, most of the animals in the film are CG. That blew my mind. Not once over the course of the movie did I question whether the animals I was watching were real. In a time when I can go to your average summer film and count the CG elements, it is great that there are movies that incorporate such subtlety that you might never question what you're watching.On a related note, I am one that would argue that the Academy Award LIFE OF PI won for cinematography was undeserved because so much of the movie was done as visual effects. As beautiful as this movie was, there were others in 2012 more deserving of the recognition for their work with physical lighting and camera-work.",8,2,5,5 July 2013
Interstellar," A Reinvigorating Blast of Science in Science Fiction...
","There were a lot of quality films released in 2014 and, while it may not be #1, INTERSTELLAR is the most mind-blowing. As much as I loved Christopher Nolan's Batman series, I'm even more excited to see him return to his own devices. The man's got vision and I love seeing it brought to screen, and INTERSTELLAR is his jump into the world of science fiction (for the record, INCEPTION was more action/fantasy than sci-fi). This is an awe- inspiring tale of mankind's last desperate attempt to save itself from extinction. In the not-too-distant future, the world's crops have fallen victim to a new blight and food is becoming scarce. The dying crops have left the soil barren and the nation has fallen into a new era of immense dust storms. Bizarre anomalies in his daughter's bedroom lead former experimental pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to a secret base containing all that remains of the NASA space program. We discover that NASA, led by Cooper's former colleague Professor Brand (Michael Caine) and his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway), has begun an operation to try and save what is left of humanity. A wormhole appeared in the vicinity of Saturn almost fifty years ago that links our solar system to a galaxy elsewhere in the universe, and a group of astronauts were sent through ten years ago to scope out potential habitable worlds for relocation. Now it's time to see what they found. The mission: Cooper and Amelia will lead an expedition through the wormhole to investigate the planets where astronauts are broadcasting positive signals, while Professor Brand will remain on Earth attempting to solve the problem of how to subjugate gravitational forces to the point where a station containing humanity's remnants could be launched from the surface of the Earth.Now that his Batman series is down and gone director Christopher Nolan can focus on original material, and I'm thankful for that. I can honestly say I've never been disappointed by the man, and now he's entered one of my favorite genres with the science fiction epic INTERSTELLAR. I love that we're seeing a new trend of 'realistic' films on space exploration and Nolan has created one of the most ambitious yet. He and his brother Jonathan have done their research and, just in case it's not enough, they had acclaimed physicist Kip Thorne on hand as a consultant on the film's science. The result is a movie that isin my personal opinionintriguing beyond words. The film posits what it would be like to travel through a wormhole and reminds us that the concept of time is not as cut-and-dry as the average person tends to believe. Travelling at insanely high speeds or close proximity to enormous gravitational sources affect the relative passage of time, and this concept is used in INTERSTELLAR as the film's 'ticking clock'. On their adventure across the cosmos, time is moving at a slower rate for Cooper and his team and minutes wasted on their expedition could equate to years lost on Earth. This is one of the most interesting elements of space travel that rarely, if ever, has been portrayed in mainstream film. It makes for a fantastic new challenge in watching this team of scientists, light years away from home, try to accomplish their goal before their mission fails purely because the human race has gone extinct in the time it took them to do it. But, as much as I loved the use of real science in the film, INTERSTELLAR is guilty of some schmaltz in the final act that weakens it.As much as I hate the idea of love being an actual force of the universe, I'm willing to accept it in the world of the film because the cast almost, sort of sells it. Nolan scores another phenomenal cast, pulling a few from previous projects and bringing on some new faces. Matthew McConaughey is in top form as the film's hero, Cooper. A former test pilot, he's called upon by NASA to pilot the craft for this expedition. In doing so, he's forced to leave his two children behind with hopes that he can accomplish the mission and give them a future. The scene where Cooper confronts his daughter with the reality that he will most likely be gone for many years is probably the most powerful in the movie. Not going to lie, that's the part that forms the lump in my throat every time. After films like KILLER JOE and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, McConaughey has sold himself as one of the top modern performers. The man has range and I hate that he wasted his talent for years before emerging as a powerhouse. Anne Hathaway does fine as Amelia Brand but he's pretty unlikeable until later in the movie. She's got noble intentions but her attitude problem and self-serving nature don't serve her well. No worries though; she has her redemption. Jessica Chastain is the third major role in the film as Cooper's daughter Murphy in her adult years. Chastain has an equally meaty role with Murphy having grown into a woman that never quite forgave her father for leaving but continued to work with Professor Brand on his gravity problem. Outside of our main three, the supporting cast (while impressive John Lithgow, Casey Affleck, etc.) is mostly filler. INTERSTELLAR primarily rests on the shoulders of McConaughey, Chastain, and Hathaway (all right, and a pair of fun robots) and they seem more than capable of caring us through.INTERSTELLAR takes a lot of hits for its climax, which I'll admit is the film's major weakness, but I really enjoy it as a whole. I never feel the expansive running time and, in fact, I'm usually eager to watch it again soon after it's finished. Good science fiction that doesn't rely on laser battles or bizarre alien monsters isn't easy to come by, so Nolan's film is a welcome breath of fresh air to the genre for me.",9,1,2,12 December 2015
Full Metal Jacket," One of the Greatest Vietnam War Films
","The Vietnam War is one of my favorite topics to see in film, as each director seems to have a different vision on the horrors and mental scarring encountered by the soldiers. Francis Ford Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW will forever by my favorite, but Stanley Kubrick's FULL METAL JACKET is a close second. Kubrick's focus in this film appears to be the soldiers themselves, as they're transformed from your average all-American youth into cold-blooded killers gunning for the enemy. The film is divided into two portions. The first introduces us to a group of fresh recruits who are assigned to a volatile drill sergeant determined to turn these maggots into the hardest of Marines. The bulk of his ire falls on a hapless recruit he dubs Gomer Pyle, who's mind is slowly warped by his hostile training environment until it reaches it's limit. The second half of the film follows another of the recruits, Joker, who has become a reporter for Stars & Stripes embedded in Vietnam. Joker is assigned to follow the 'Lusthog Squad' to Phu Bai and experiences his first real encounter under fire when the squad is pinned down by a sniper.The first half of this film is fantastic and I became so enthralled with the story of these boot camp recruits that I was shaken when the story suddenly shifted to Vietnam for the final half. The first time I'd seen the film, I was confused. I honestly thought the movie was ending with the conclusion of the Parris Island segment. Instead, the audience is whisked halfway around the world for further exploration into the dehumanization of the soldiers when Joker and his photographer Rafterman are sent into the field where they encounter their first major combat experiences. From the start, Joker's retained his sarcastic cynicism throughout the trials of boot camp until his arrival in Vietnam, but we watch as that naivety is ripped away when he sees the violent horrors of his fellow soldiers are gunned down and he comes face to face with a Vietnamese sniper. Kubrick's movie is about, from what I can gather, the dehumanization required for war and slaps us in the face with the effects it has on a man. It's a powerful film and a glimpse into what soldiers experience in their time serving their nation.Some of the dialogue doesn't quite sit well (the one instance that stands out in my mind is the banter between Joker and Animal Mother in their first meeting) but a great deal of it is saved by the actors. There is some great talent here on display early in their careers including Matthew Modine (Joker), Adam Baldwin (Animal Mother), Arliss Howard (Cowboy), and a great performance by Vincent D'Onofrio in his first major role as Gomer Pyle. Strangely enough, the best performance in the entire film isn't even from an actor. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor, Hartman, is the most memorable character in the film. He brings his real military experience to the character and explodes in every scene. His obscene motivation has become so embedded in public consciousness that it has been spoofed and referenced everywhere. Ermey and FULL METAL JACKET single-handedly turned me off of ever considering military service as a career, and it's a great film to bring the viewer into the world of a a grunt.",9,0,1,8 February 2011
Pacific Rim," Awesome Visuals and Thin Plot/Characters; Fun Popcorn Cinema
","With all of the sequels, prequels, and remakes that flooded movie theaters in the summer of 2013, you would think audiences would be hungry for something original. Guillermo Del Toro, a modern cinematic visionary, does just that and creates an homage to Japanese giant monster films with PACIFIC RIM and the nation responds with a near universal shrug of disinterest and barely half of it's budget in box office returns. Thankfully, the movie found some massive love overseas and made a nice profit so as to not discourage Del Toro from any future endeavors (or any studios from hiring him again). While my daughter has become a fan of the early Godzilla films, I was never a fan of the Japanese kaiju genre and the closest I ever came was watching the Power Rangers as a child. But I know a good time when I see one and I knew a modern movie about giant robots battling giant monsters from the man who did BLADE II and the HELLBOY movies was worth checking out. The premise is simple enough: giant monsters dubbed Kaiju begin emerging from an interdimensional fissure on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. In an effort to combat these beasts, the human race has united in a program of constructing giant robots known as Jaegers, mentally controlled by two pilots. The movie is set more than a decade into the Kaiju war and we're on the losing end as the Kaiju attacks become more and more persistent. The Jaeger program is being shut down to reallocate the funds into creating giant coastal walls, but Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba), the man in charge of the Jaeger program, isn't ready give in. He recruits Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam), a former Jaeger pilot with a tragic past, for one last mission in hopes of ending the war once and for all.I know there's a load of people out there shouting about how this movie isn't original and it ripped it this anime and that anime, and I don't care. I don't watch anime. I'm know Del Toro was heavily inspired by anime (he's a huge fan) and I'm more than happy to just revel in the love letter he's written to these Japanese genres in the form of PACIFIC RIM. It's not a great movie, but it's a pretty good one regardless. It's fun, visually gorgeous, and it's got some fantastic battle sequences, even if its story and characters are all pretty basic and shallow. This movie is eye candy, but it's epic level eye candy. The visual effects are spectacular and the movie's focal points, the Kaiju and Jaegers, are fantastically designed. Each of the robots and creatures has a unique design to stand out from the others though I only wish we'd had an opportunity to see them battle in broad daylight where we could truly appreciate all of the detail that went into them. Every battle happens at night, in rainstorms, etc. It's a missed opportunity and the closest we get is a nice series of shots of a Kaiju rampaging in Sydney, Australia. The entire movie is filled with vibrant colors and it's all beautifully shot. The film was shot by cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and, if you're familiar with any of his previous work, you know to expect good things. PACIFIC RIM is, if nothing else, a visual feast with some brutal robot-on-monster battle action.The rest of the film's elements are where it stumbles a bit. The cast is filled with an eclectic mix of talent. You've got Charlie Hunnam and Rinko Kikuchi are the film's heroes who suffer from a lack of decent chemistry. As the pilots of our hero Jaeger, Gypsy Danger, they're our main focus. They've got a bit of depth to them with a little backstory behind them to explain why Raleigh (Hunnam) wants to avoid the Jaeger program and Mako (Kikuchi) wants so desperately to be a part of it. Unfortunately, I never felt much of a real spark between them. Idris Elba is the grizzled commander in charge of the Jaeger initiative. Elba is a talented man and provides one of the stronger performances as he riles up a passion in the men under his command to fight. We get comic relief in the form of the Jaeger program's science team, Newt (Charlie Day) and Gottlieb (Burn Gorman), and Del Toro regular Ron Perlman has a sweet supporting role as a black market peddler of Kaiju remains. None of the characters are mind-blowingly developed but there's enough behind each of them to give them some motivation. The plot is paper thin: beat the monsters and destroy the source. There wasn't much effort put into plot elements, as this movie is all about the action. This means the section in the middle of the film while Raleigh and the rest of the Jaeger program ready for their final mission tends to drag. It's all about character development at that point and the characters were totally outshined by the robots/monsters so that's what we're aching to see by that point. Once the action kicks into gear in Hong Kong, it's all up hill from there.PACIFIC RIM is spectacle cinema and it's a blast to watch, especially on the big screen. It's not an overly intelligent film and you're probably best off shutting down your mind, munching on some popcorn, and taking in the killer visuals. It's a fun experience I'm happy Del Toro got his love letter to Japanese giant monsters out of his system because he's still got a dozen other projects on his agenda that I'm excited about.",8,1,2,25 January 2014
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Lucas improves after 'Phantom Menace'...
","I have to admit, George Lucas has done better with 'Attack Of The Clones' (though the title reeks of cheesy 50's sci-fi). While 'The Phantom Menace' was style without substance, 'Attack Of The Clones' delves deeper into the story, with Anakin drifting closer towards the Dark Side. I will start by saying I love the look of this movie. It seems that the darker storyline shows through the visuals. Every world depicted in this film mirrors the atmosphere of the plot. Even Naboo, previously a sunny, colorful planet, always seems covered in shadow, except when Anakin and Padme are growing closer together (moments of happiness in an otherwise dreary time). The world of Kamino, an ocean planet that would normally be a gorgeous blue marble, is constantly racked by raging storms. Its as if even the galaxy seems to predict its inevitable suffering.I wasn't as put off by the acting in this film. While some of it remains very wooden, there were some worthwhile performances this time around. I have come to believe that Ewan McGregor was probably the best choice to portray the young Obi-Wan Kenobi. The best performances in this film come from supporting stars Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McDiarmid, and Christopher Lee. I only have two problems with the casting in this movie: Hayden Christensen and the CGI Yoda. I just can't stand Christensen's acting in this film. While he is supposed to portray Anakin Skywalker as an angst-ridden teenager, he comes off as more of a pouting child. It seems as if he is more suitable for a teen-drama on the WB than as the man who is to become one of the most fearsome villains in movie history. As for Yoda, I just miss the puppet. I understand CGI is needed for scenes where there is a lot of movement, but I think the puppet worked best for close-ups and such. Maybe I am just nostalgic.The plot is thicker in this film compared to 'The Phantom Menace' and drags at points, but there is always something right around the corner to pick it back up and drag you in. If Lucas keeps improving at this rate, I can't wait to see what happens with 'Revenge Of The Sith'.",7,1,3,11 May 2005
Ant-Man," Paul Rudd's Ant-Man is a Welcome Addition to the MCU
","Marvel Studios loves to flaunt their skills. They made comic book/superhero movies a cultural juggernaut, nailed the idea of a shared cinematic universe, and proved that even their strangest properties can have a home on the big screen where audiences will embrace them. If GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY didn't prove that Marvel can pretty much do whatever they want, ANT-MAN does. ANT-MAN was probably their highest risk venture since the original IRON MAN; a wealth of behind-the-scenes struggles gave the impression that the movie might never see the light of day and left some of us wondering if whatever was left would taint Marvel's amazing track record. Well, ANT-MAN has come and gone and, no surprise, Marvel nailed it. Our hero in ANT-MAN is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), a cat burglar freshly released from prison who hopes to turn his life around so he can spend more time with his young daughter. Society proves hesitant to forgive a feloneven when his crime was punishing a corporation for ripping off its customersand Scott starts to wonder if a life of crime might be his only option after all. Rumors of an easy score lead Scott to break into the home of Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), a genius inventor with former ties to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the discovery of the fabled Ant-Man suit. Of course, Pym was the one who started the rumor to test Scott's thieving skills because he needs the ex- con's help. One of Pym's former apprentice's, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), has nearly cracked Pym's technique for shrinking matter by lessening the space between atoms and he intends on selling this incredibly dangerous tech to the highest bidder. Pym needs Scott to become Ant-Man and use the incredible shrinking ability to pull off his most incredible heist yet, saving the world.ANT-MAN, from director Peyton Reed and a handful of screenwriters, is so much better than it had any right to be. I was admittedly bummed when Edgar Wright left the project, citing creative differences, because I was excited to see what such a uniquely creative force would bring to the project. I understand some of Wright's contributions survived to the final product and I couldn't tell you who contributed what, but I really like the end result. ANT-MAN continues a trend that'd been developing within Marvel's second 'phase' of movies where they experiment with the idea of creating superhero movies outside of the usual 'good-guy-punching-bad-guy' genre. ANT-MAN is a heist film that just so happens to utilize a superhero that can shrink and communicate with ants. And it's just as much a comedy as an action film. Ant-Man's first big screen outing could've easily just aped IRON MAN and followed a familiar route but instead they took some risks that paid off in one of the more fun recent Marvel movies. Perhaps taking a cue from Chris Pratt's casting as Star Lord, comedian Paul Rudd was cast as the shrinking hero and he knocks it out of the park. His charisma and sense of humor make him a perfect hero, and he's got great chemistry with little Abby Ryder Fortson who plays his daughter Cassie. Moment of honesty: I get a little choked in the big (small?) final battle when Cassie is in danger, Scott Lang arrives on the scene and pops his faceplate up with a 'Hi, peanut!', and Cassie just smiles broadly, forgetting for a moment she's being held captive by a super-villain. I can't not (yes, double negative) feel for the guy and, because he's Paul Rudd, he's just inhumanly likable. The character of Scott Lang, as played by Rudd, is a welcome addition to the Marvel franchise.I also can't get over how strange it is to see legendary Michael Douglas acting in a Marvel film. And he's not some throwaway side character like Glenn Close in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY; he's Hank Pym! And he's not phoning it in either so, you know, extra bonus. He's having some fun here. I'm not sure the same can be said for Evangeline Lilly as Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne. She's cold and humorless for most of the film and doesn't start to warm up until we're nearing the big heist, so it makes it a little difficult to cheer for the inevitable hookup with Scott that the movie telegraphs from miles away. Coming out the worst is poor Yellowjacket/Darren Cross. Marvel's notorious for having trouble putting out three-dimensional villains in the films and Cross is one of the worst examples. He's motivated by anger toward Pym for not letting him in on the world of Ant-Man and I guess he's also going sort of crazy from shrink-related malpractice. He'll never stand up along the likes of Loki (has anyone?) but we do get a super-fun battle between the tiny hero and villain in a child's train set. Speaking of the shrinking, the visual effects in this movie are fantastic. I love the shrinking/enlarging effects and the ant design, and every time we get to explore the world from a micro-level is a blast. So congratulations to Marvel for this one. ANT- MAN went from my biggest concern to one of my more anticipated franchises. This movie teases fun directions for future films and I'm excited for any chance we'll get to revisit Ant-Man's unique perspective. Just keep the light-hearted sense of fun and humor and I'm sure this series will continue to stand out in an ever-growing sea of superheroes.",8,1,3,18 June 2016
21 Jump Street," Hilarious, One of the Funniest of 2012
","I was only a few years old when the original television show hit the airwaves, so I only know the original as the show that starred a young Johnny Depp. That's about it. I had little interest in seeing this movie until the reviews started hitting the web and touting it as a lot funnier than I would have imagined. I still haven't gotten over how horrible THE SITTER was, so Jonah Hill was not high on my list of must-see headliners. And the only film I'd seen Channing Tatum in was G.I. JOE, which isn't exactly a comedy (well, not intentionally). But I was wrong to doubt them because 21 JUMP STREET is the funniest movie I've seen so far this year. This is 21 JUMP STREET for a new generation; specifically, a generation that isn't necessarily familiar with the television show. The premise is the same: police officers infiltrating a high school. But it's done with a modern sense of humor and an edge. Schmidt (Hill) was always a loser in high school, a bleach-blonde Eminem wannabe without an ounce of style. Jenko (Tatum) was your typical obnoxious jock, popular with the students while neglecting his studies. After graduation Schmidt and Jenko, find themselves enrolled in the police academy where their opposite talents (Schmidt's academics and Jenko's physicality) lead them to become partners and best friends. They're soon transferred to Jump Street where they are sent undercover at the local high school to flush out the dealers of a new drug called HFS. High school should be a cinch this time around, but things have changedThis movie could have easily gone in a terrible direction. It could have been a tired rehashing of the same old material and been lazy with the jokes. The premise makes it an easy target: a buddy cop movie set in a high school. Sure, there are some jokes you might see coming here but 21 JUMP STREET does what it can to spin your expectations. From the start of their investigation, things go wrong when Schmidt and Jenko accidentally swap their new identities. So now Schmidt has the sleeper classes and Jenko finds himself tackling AP Chemistry. Now each of them is dropped into the opposite clique from what they originally experienced in high school and must continue to blend in. It opens up a hilarious new set of gags for the movie when Schmidt is finally the popular new kid on campus, a position he cherishes a little too much. Jonah Hill has redeemed himself for THE SITTER and he's back in true form here, while Tatum has proved that he's got some great comedic acting chops. Honestly, Tatum has some of the funniest scenes in the movie. And the two of them have great buddy chemistry together. Jonah Hill shares a writing credit on this movie, so I have to give some respect to him for putting together (with Michael Bacall) an awesome action/comedy that excels as both genres.Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have collected an excellent supporting cast for the movie including Ice Cube, Dave Franco, Brie Larson, and Rob Riggle. Cube is the angry captain in charge of the Jump Street unit, openly embracing the stereotype of the angry black captain (he worked his a** off to become captain and, yeah, he gets angry sometimes). Larson is the 'sort of' love interest for Schmidt when he gets in close with the popular kids. And then there's Rob Riggle, a man I have yet to see fail at being hilarious, as the school's P.E. teacher Mr. Walters. This movie is loaded with laughs, and one of the few movies I actually laughed out loud at this year. The action scenes are surprisingly well done too. The movie has it's share of car chases and gun play, and it's always played for laughs. From the beginning, Schmidt and Jenko want nothing more than to be the sort of cops they see in movies and TVjumping away from explosions with guns blazingand by the time the movie is over, they'll be living the dream. 21 JUMP STREET is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a solid comedy with a dose of action. There are even a few cameos in the movie to satisfy fans of the original television show even if people like me don't catch any but the best one near the finale. There's really enough in 21 JUMP STREET for fans and non-fans to enjoy.",9,0,2,2 October 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," The Best Marvel Movie Since IRON MAN
","Here it is: the final ingredient for Marvel Studios' ambitious Avengers crossover film in the summer of 2012. Honestly, I wasn't all that excited in the months leading up to Captain America's big budget induction into Marvel's film canon for a few reasons. When I'd originally read that director Joe Johnston would be stepping in to helm the film, my mind kept going back to JURASSIC PARK 3 and how it had tainted a fun franchise. Combine that with the fact that I've never been a die-hard Captain America fan and the knowledge that the filmmaker's were going to have a lot of story on their hands if they wanted to bring the Captain America story to the point where he's ready for an Avengers crossover (covering his origins, his time in WWII, his arrival in contemporary times, etc.) in one film; I had severe doubts going in. For the non-Marvel fans, Captain America tells the story of Steve Rogers, a young man desperate to enlist in the military and fight for his country in World War II. Unfortunately he's got a list of physical problems that more than ensure he'll never see combat; that is, until he's approached by Dr. Abraham Erskine who wishes to test a new serum on Rogers. The procedure turns Rogers from a scrawny weakling into a super soldier and he becomes America's hero. As Captain America, it becomes apparent that he might be the country's only real hope against the forces of HYDRA and it's leader, the Red Skull.I admit I was wrong about this movie. It's the best Marvel film since the first IRON MAN in 2008. This is because it doesn't necessarily feel as if I'm watching a 'superhero' movie. When I saw THOR earlier this year (and especially GREEN LANTERN), I started wondering if all these superhero comic-inspired movies were beginning to fall into a pattern where each of them would start feeling like the same tale over and over with different characters. As if Hollywood execs would just create a superhero Mad Libs and fill out the lines with a different character each time and follow the same mold. CAPTAIN America didn't have that feeling. This movie felt more like an action/adventure film in the same vein as the Indiana Jones series that just happened to feature a super-powered protagonist. His powers aren't flashy and over-the-top. He can't fly or transform or fire energy blasts. He's just super strong, fast, and handy with a shield. As a result, the movie feels more grounded in reality (despite HYDRA's future tech and Howard Stark's gizmos). The Red Skull's abuse of the cosmic cube and the power it gives him to create his weapon of mass destruction feels no different from the Nazi's obsession with utilizing the Ark of the Covenant. I wasn't aware how badly I was missing a good adventure film until CAPTAIN America came around. I hope they continue the same adventure vibe with future movies in the series despite Cap's arrival in contemporary times.There were a few major mistakes this movie could've made that would've turned the whole thing into a joke, but they avoid all of them. The filmmakers had a real challenge with this one, keeping the WWII origins intact and creating a style for the Captain that stays true to his design without coming off as too hokey. I love that the designers showed some love for the original costume in the propaganda sequences, and the actual costume was a great combination of the original Captain America with a more realistic style. Chris Evans was a perfect choice for the title role. We may as well forget that he ever played the Human Torch in the FANTASTIC 4 movies, because this is Evan's ideal comic hero role. He gives Rogers/Cap a real charisma and fighting spirit; he is the ultimate 'good guy'. And his villain is just as perfect. Hugo Weaving is a perfect villain for any movie, so it makes sense that he'd make such an awesome Red Skull. He hams it up just enough to be menacing and memorable without going over the edge into comical. With all of these strengths, my only complaint would probably be that the movie had to rush and get Rogers into modern times. I know we've got an Avengers movie to look forward too but I wish we'd had a little more time of Captain America kicking Nazi butt. Otherwise, CAPTAIN America was my surprise hit for the summer.",8,4,7,19 December 2011
American Hustle," Great Retro Vibe and Awesome Performances
","So, I had the realization recently that I'd never actually seen a David O. Russell film. I've somehow gone as long as I have without them, despite hearing nothing but great things about them. I've seen his films come and go and there's never been one that's been interesting enough for me to watch. Until American HUSTLE. I'm a sucker for the sixties and seventies, and the film's got a nice roster of talent: Christian Bale, Amy Adams, Jennifer Lawrence, Bradley Cooper, and Jeremy Renner. Honestly, the images of Bale with a gut and a comb-over were enough to garner my interest. It's just so bizarre. I'm glad I checked it out because it was one of the more entertaining movies I saw in 2013. It's funnier than I expected and I love a good con-man tale. American HUSTLE is apparently inspired by real events. Specifically, the Abscam investigation from the late seventies. The film focuses on the con artists at the heart of the investigation: Irving Rosenfeld (Bale) and Sydney Prosser (Adams). After being busted for fraud, the two are given a second chance when approached by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Cooper). DiMaso's interested in the bigger picture of political corruption, and he wants Rosenfeld and Prosser to cooperate with the operation. Their first target is Carmine Polito (Renner), the mayor of Camden, in hopes of getting him to accept bribes from a fictional Arab sheik in return for funding to rebuild Atlantic City. The operation gains traction and soon DiMaso's got the opportunity to go after Congressmen, as long as the plan isn't ruined by Rosenfeld's crass wife (Lawrence) or the threat of involvement from the mob.For starters, I love the film's design. Kudos to design team for recreating everything about the seventies and giving a cool authenticity to the whole film. The music, the fashion, and the production design all bring the seventies to life and the cinematography from Linus Sandgren takes it to another level. I've got to say, this movie is gorgeous to look at. The soundtrack's great and builds on the vibe with tunes from Elton John, Santana, and, my personal favorite addition, the title track for LIVE AND LET DIE from Paul McCartney & Wings. You almost wouldn't recognize Bale as Rosenfeld. With his gut hanging over his pants and a hilarious comb-over that we watch him carefully construct in the opening scene of the film, he oozes seventies swindler in his retro suits and aviator sunglasses. Jeremy Renner reminds us that he's more than an action star as the scam's main focus, Mayor Carmine Polito. With his Jersey accent and pompadour hair, he disappears into his character pretty effectively and becomes the only real sympathetic character. Polito does what he does in the movie with his sole intention being rebuilding his beloved town. He sees the ghettos and the hard times and sees the arrival of the 'sheik' as his chance of reviving commerce. Renner's great and breaks away from the Marvel/Hawkeye role that I (and probably many people at this point, seeing as it's how his most prominent recent role) associate him with.It's not fair to focus on just Bale and Renner because everyone in this movie is great. Everyone seems to step out of their comfort zone a bit for roles that you wouldn't normally attribute to them. Bradley Cooper, usually a handsome leading man, is an ambitious FBI agent who quickly discovers he's the butt of the joke. Jennifer Lawrence turns on the white trash for her role as Rosalyn, Irving's wife. Yes, her character is aggravating (a stereotypical Jersey wife, if garbage reality TV is any indication) but you see the motivations behind her often dangerous behavior. If nothing else, it's interesting to see her as someone so damaged and crude. The characters in the film are all interesting in their own ways and I love their natural interactions. I'd seen there was a good deal of improvisation on set and, if that's the case, it worked out well. I love the natural flow of conversation and I think, for it to have turned out as it did, the actors/actresses had to have really inhabited their characters. As a result, American HUSTLE is a lot of fun. I was surprised to find that the movie ran for almost an hour and a half but you never feel its length. It's got a great flow, even if the ending feels a little rushed. Once the mob becomes involved (with an awesome cameo I didn't see coming), the film sort of runs for the finish line and ties it up a little quicker than I expected for a scam so complex. If I were to have any complaints about American HUSTLE, I suppose it'd be that the whole Abscam thing seems overly complicated at times without knowing some history behind it but it's not enough to detract from the fun of this film.",9,0,4,28 July 2014
Rush," RUSH Was a Surprise Gem for this Non-Race Fan
","I will always appreciate a movie that can generate my interest in something that I previously couldn't care less about. In the case of RUSH, that something is racing. Specifically, Formula-1 racing. RUSH is another in a long line of films based on actual events to come out in 2013 and it ranks right up there with the best of them. It receives bonus points for the fact that those involved in the original events claim RUSH to actually be pretty accurate in its details, with a little creative liberty taken by the filmmakers to jazz it up a bit. It's the story of a rivalry that captured international attention in the 1976 Formula-1 racing season. James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are very different men and both of them are incredibly talented drivers. The movie begins as the two struggle to make their mark on the Formula-3 circuit and follows their rise into the spotlight of Formula-1 in the pursuit of the world championship. As the two battle neck-and-neck for position, their rivalry fuels them to push harder and faster until a disastrous moment changes both their lives and professional relationship. RUSH has become my favorite film from director Ron Howard (note: I've never seen APOLLO 13 so that could change. I know, blasphemy.) and is probably one of my top favorite movies from the year. It succeeded at both making racing interesting to a non-fan while crafting two incredibly interesting characters who are competing for polar opposite reasons.For starters, I'm one of those anti-NASCAR sorts who can't be bothered to watch a bunch of people 'drive in circles' for hours on end. For me to willfully watch a movie about the sport of racing (and, yes, I'm aware there's a difference between NASCAR and Formula-1 racing), it took a healthy batch of glowing positive reviews. And RUSH received heaps of praise when it hit. When combined with Chris Hemsworth's rising stardom thanks to his role as Thor in the Marvel cinematic universe (of which I'm a fan), it was enough to get my attention and I'm so glad I gave it a shot. RUSH is a blast, from the edge-of-your-seat racing segments to the back-and-forth trash talk between two talented professionals on opposite sides of the coin. Hunt is a daredevil. He drives for the thrill of the ride and revels in how close he comes to death with each event. He's in it for the glory. Lauda is a meticulous man. He uses a keen business sense in conjunction with his racing skill to master his craft. He's in it for the respect. The two ideologies bumping heads is what powers RUSH and keeps the audience invested. As cool as the racing segments are, they're nothing compared to the moments with the racers themselves. As I understand, a lot of the racing was done in camera with a minimal amount of CG to enhance the visuals. It helps, as the Formula-1 races and fast and brutal and CG cars would've dulled any sense of danger. And the movie isn't shy about showing the downsides to the Formula-1 lifestyle. Racers died in the sport (at least two a year at the time, if the movie is to be believed) and the excitement of the race circuit is intercut with the occasional accident to remind the viewer of the stakes.Chris Hemsworth and, especially, Daniel Brühl should've received more attention for their performances here. There was a lot of praise when the movie debuted but it had fizzled before awards season hit. Chris Hemsworth is commendable but Hunt isn't exactly a character that strikes me as outside his wheelhouse. Hunt is boisterous and often drunk; he's a daredevil with a mean party streak and Hemsworth fills the role perfectly. He's your typical jock in most regards but he's got the added bonus of obsession of staring death in the face. But he's not a total jerk and we see a welcome change in him in the final third of the movie following the disaster at Nürburgring. Brühl has the meatier role here in Niki Lauda. His performance is mesmerizing whenever he's on screen. He's such a peculiar man. Born in Austria, Lauda is abrasively candid, unafraid to call out Hunt for his dangerous race habits or tell the owner of Ferrari that his newest racer is a pile of garbage. His no-holds-barred nature and the fact that he bought his way into Formula-1 with personal loans earn him some enemies and ultimately contributes to his near fatal accident. Hemsworth may have the star power and top billing in the film but this is definitely Brühl's film in the end. Regardless, Howard does a fantastic job of balancing each character in the film, giving us the film from both perspectives. There's no hero and villain here. Just two men with a drive to be world champions.",9,1,1,21 June 2014
Nightcrawler," A Seriously Awesome Film; Gyllenhaal is Amazing
","Seriously, Jake Gyllenhaal has become an acting powerhouse in recent years. He's always been a talented guy but he's really taken over the spotlight with some amazing work lately. For example, his work with Denis Villeneuve (especially ENEMY) was fantastic, if you haven't already checked it out. Now he's come along and blown away both of those with NIGHTCRAWLER, from writer/director Dan Gilroy. For what it's worth, I'm ranking this as my favorite movie from 2014. Robert Elswit's cinematography is gorgeous, the three key cast nail it, and the story puts the network news system on blast for shady practices. Gyllenhaal is Lou Bloom, a local Los Angeles loser whom we meet as he's stealing metal from constructions sites to see for scrap. When he stumbles across a late night accident on the freeway, he's amazed to find a freelance camera team breeze in, grab some footage, and gun out for the next piece of news carnage. Bloom buys a set of cameras, hires a desperate assistant, and starts his own team. His disregard for procedure and human decency allows him to get the real bloody footage that other news crews can't and he becomes a hit with a local network news outfit. As time progresses, Bloom's footage becomes more and more risqué and he develops a stranglehold on the station's desperation for ratings. Bloom means business and the lengths he'll go for hit news become frighteningly apparent, and he refuses to let anyone stand between him and his success.This is Gyllenhaal's show and Lou Bloom is his best character to date. Bloom is a full- blown psychopath. We're given a glimpse in the opening when he's caught stealing the scrap metal; when he realizes it's an independent security outfit and not a police officer, he has no problem going on the assault. He's a fast-talker and incredibly intelligent. It makes you wonder how a man of his skill was down on his luck to begin with (unless that whole psychopath thing has closed a lot of career opportunities to him). When it comes down to it, Bloom is a terrifying individual. He holds no value for human life and he only values personal success, frequently at the expense of others. From what we learn, he's perfectly suited for the job as a nightcrawler or stringer (freelance camera teams who roam the city in search of footage to sell to local news). He has no qualms with getting right into the middle of the action, forgoing good taste in exchange for video other crews can't, or won't, obtain. He becomes an instant hit with news manager Nina (Rene Russo). He's her ratings guarantee, a chance to rise to the top of the local competition. She's just as unscrupulous as Bloom and she's willing to go towellgreat lengths to retain their business partnership. Russo and Riz Ahmed (as Bloom's assistant Rick) are really the only other two main characters in the movie and they all deserve accolades for their work here.As much as NIGHTCRAWLER is the tale of one psycho's rise to the top of his game, it's also a commentary on local news and the lengths to which they'll go to keep people tuning in. Bloom is only able to become a success because fear sells. Murders, carjackings, fatal accidentsthis is what grabs the peoples' attention and the news outlets know this. Constructing faux crime sprees out of isolated incidents and flashing pixilated corpses on the screen is enough to terrify the populace and keep them tuning in for more. The local news, as portrayed in NIGHTCRAWLER (and most assuredly true to life), is just as shady as the 24-hour cable news networks and their fear-monger campaigns (as satirized in David Fincher's GONE GIRL, also in 2014). Bloom violates the law and human decency because it's what the audience wants to see, and his disgusting nature is rewarded. NIGHTCRAWLER is definitely a dark movie and it's seriously an awesome watch. It's a gritty rags-to-riches story where the one person who displays an ounce of morality, Rick, eventually caves to the lure of extra cash. The end of NIGHTCRAWLER is one that leaves you feeling a little morose because we expect justice, but instead it plays against our expectations as a reminder that, in the real world, the good guys don't always triumph. This is a 100% recommendation on my part; NIGHTCRAWLER is a fantastic.",9,3,5,12 September 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," It's Good for a Few Laughs but POPSTAR Hasn't Got a Lot of Substance
","It was only a matter of time before the Lonely Island guys came out with a music mockumentary; I just expected it to be about Lonely Island. Nope. Andy Samberg, Jorma Taccone, and Akiva Schaffer instead bring us into the world of fictional international pop icon Conner4real (Samberg). The movie is constructed as a behind-the-scenes/concert film for Conner as he prepares to release the follow-up album to his massive hit solo debut. Conner was originally a member of boy band/hip-hop trio the Style Boyz but broke off on his own when his ego became too much to handle for the trio's writer, Lawrence (Schaffer). Now Conner tours the world with the band's third member, Owen (Taccone), as his DJ while Lawrence has retired to a quiet life of farming and subpar wood carving. Conner's second album debuts with such controversial hits as 'Equal Rights' and 'Bin Laden' and becomes an instant flop. Unable to cope with failure and surrounded by useless sycophants, Conner life begins a downward spiral and Owen believes a Style Boyz reunion would be the best thing for everyone. Unfortunately, Conner and Lawrence didn't exactly part on the best of terms and getting the two of them in a room to talk, much less reunite for a performance, is going to be near impossible. POPSTAR: NEVER STOP NEVER STOPPING is an improv- laden mockumentary in the same vein of THIS IS SPINAL TAP but never achieves its level of awesomeness, but it has got its share of laughs.I enjoyed POPSTAR for what it is but watching it has made me realize how much I miss normal scripted comedies. Improv films can be real hit-or-miss and this one is no different, but I'd say the scales tip in favor of the funnier bits. There aren't a whole lot of hilarious moments that'll be with you too long after the movie is over, but you're bound to get some chuckles from it if this is your type of comedy. Personally, my favorite gag comes about halfway through the movie when Conner's manager Harry (Tim Meadows, excellent as usual) is breaking some bad news to the singer over some breakfast mimosas and Conner has a rough moment, asking the documentarians to kill the cameras for a minute. The video cuts out but we keep the audio as their tender conversation quickly turns when a wandering bee becomes a nuisance and quickly escalates to a battle of life and death. That was probably the one time the movie got a solid laugh from me. The rest is a bit of a mixed bag but fans of Samberg and the Lonely Island material from 'Saturday Night Live' shouldn't be disappointed. There are plenty of new songs created for the movie and Conner4real and some of them are pretty good, but there's nothing on the level of 'J*zz in My Pants', 'I'm on a Boat', or 'Motherlover'. This is why I was hoping it'd be a mockumentary about Lonely Island: great music catalog.Since it's a 'documentary', it's filled with cameos from music artists who've got a sense of humor and contributed interview snippets including RZA, Mariah Carey, and Ringo Starr. You can also expect the usual cavalcade of comedic talent filling out the rest of the case, such as the aforementioned Tim Meadows as Conner's manager and Sarah Silverman as his press agent. There is plenty of talent on display here; Samberg and company pulled out all the stops to surround him with high quality cast-mates. So even if the comedy isn't your style, you can spend the duration of the movie tracking the endless stream of cameos. Otherwise, it's exactly what you would expect for a Lonely Island mockumentary. If that's your thing, you'll probably find a reason to watch and I'm sure you'll enjoy it fine. If not, this movie isn't likely going to win you over. POPSTAR is what it is and to me it's a fun piece of throwaway entertainment that might've aspired to SPINAL TAP levels and fell short. The Apatow style of improv that's permeated comedies in the last ten years is good for a quick laugh but most of the movies of this sort are quickly forgotten and I'm sure POPSTAR, as amusing as it can be, will probably fall into that category.",7,0,2,11 September 2017
Oblivion," Predictable and Drawn Out, but a Visual Feast
","As far as I can tell, OBLIVION is MOON (the awesome Duncan Jones science fiction film from 2009) for people who need their sci-fi with more firefights and explosions. For anyone who hasn't seen MOON and doesn't know what I'm talking about, stop wasting time here and go watch it. It's awesome. OBLIVION is science fiction with a classic vibe and a more mainstream mentality. The premise is a combination of a handful of popular sci-fi tropes mashed together with Tom Cruise in the lead, Morgan Freeman as a mysterious figure, and a couple beautiful women for Cruise to cavort with while saving the world. It's a film loaded with beautiful imagery but a tendency to try to force a sense of grandiose complexity that it never really achieves. The movie is set in a distant future where the world has been ravaged from war against an alien species that ended with the destruction of the moon. Most of humanity has evacuated the planet for the moon of Titan in orbit of Saturn. Tom Cruise is Jack, an engineer left behind to repair aerial drones that protect salt-water harvesters from a scattering of remaining aliens intent on sabotaging the operation. Jack operates from a home perched on a Sky Tower miles above the ground with his partner/wife Vika (Andrea Riseborough) while they await the end of their contract and their chance to join the rest of the human race on Titan. As the time approaches, complications arise when an escape pod crash-lands on Earth carrying a woman (Olga Kurylenko) and a powerful secret to reveal about Jack's existence.Probably the first thing anyone will notice about OBLIVION is that it looks amazing. No matter what negative opinions people might offer about the movie, no one can complain that it looks shoddy. Everything here looks fantastic. The landscape is far-reaching and barren with occasional artifacts rising up from the desert to signify the society that once thrived there, whether it be a grounded ocean freighter or a surviving piece of New York's iconic skyline. The home sitting at the top of the Sky Tower is a pseudo-futuristic style where everything is spotless and streamlined. There are windows on every side of the home to provide an awesome 360-degree view. I love the design of the drones and I especially love the fact that they were shot practically when the filmmakers were able to give them a sense of realism. There is a fantastic shot about halfway through the movie or so with a drone slowly hovering through a shattered window, pushing through flaming curtains for a sinister reveal. Fantastic stuff. And then there's the bubble ship. The bubble ship is an atmospheric flyer and primary form of transport for Jack, with a gyroscopic bubble cockpit allowing for some pretty wicked flight shots. Visually, this movie is a perfect 10 but there's still the little matter of the plot and such. Not that there's anything wrong with it, but it just doesn't live up to the quality of the film's style.Anyone who's seen their share of science fiction will see right through this film from the start. There's a major reveal a little more than halfway through the film that I won't reveal here for anyone who hasn't watched it yet, but I'm going to admit that I saw most of it coming within the first ten minutes of the film. Jack and Vika report each day to their mission control, based out of an orbital station known as the Tet. The Tet issues their daily assignments and provides support for their mission (the water harvesters). From the first video conversation between Vika and Sally (Melissa Leo, their contact aboard the Tet), I had this movie pegged and knew what to expect. This isn't to say the plot is weak or the twist is stupid. Actually, I think it's pretty entertaining. I've just seen enough movies of this nature to know where they were going with it. There were a few surprises in there that I wasn't able to see coming. The movie is well done. It's just very familiar. The cast is mostly superb. I'm probably one of Tom Cruise's few real film fans left, it seems. I'll agree that he has a tendency to do a lot of the same in each of his movies and he doesn't always disappear into his character, but he does well and he's a fine action star for his age. I thought he was great in OBLIVION. Andrea Riseborough and Morgan Freeman do a great job as well (though you don't really expect any less from Freemanthe dude's awesome). Olga Kurylenko is fine, though she doesn't seem to have a whole lot to work with here. I'm not entirely sure what I feel about Kurylenko as an actress. She's definitely gorgeous but she's never really turned in a performance that stood out to me. Here, she's fine.For people that need more 'splosions with their sci-fi, OBLIVION delivers. It's a more mainstream science fiction film that incorporates plenty of action to keep audiences riveted between drawn-out, plot-driven scenes. If OBLIVION has one major flaw, it'd be that it drones on a little longer than necessary. It feels as if director Joseph Kosinski is trying to emphasize an epic scale that the movie hasn't earned when he would've been a better off tightening it down a bit. So, OBLIVION in a nutshell: predictable and drawn out, but visually amazing with an effective cast.",7,2,3,25 October 2013
Burn After Reading," Another Great Coen Bros. Comedy
","I love that BURN AFTER READING is an engaging, and often hilarious, spy movie without any actual spies. Sure, the whole premise is centered around a former employee of the CIA but he's no more than an analyst (and a pugnacious, raging alcoholic). The actual CIA of the film has no idea what's going on, what these people are engaged in, or whether it's worth their time to investigate. The movie comes from the Coen brothers, a writing/directing team that I've yet to see fail. BURN AFTER READING probably ranks towards the top of my favorite Coen films (but it's no BIG LEBOWSKI). In the film, Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is fired from his position as an analyst within the CIA when his alcoholism becomes a problem. Meanwhile, his wife (Swinton) is debating whether to leave him for her lover, a paranoid Marshal (Clooney). Falling into depression, Cox decides to occupy his time by writing his memoirs, a memoir that soon lands in the hands of two inept gym employees. Linda Litzke (McDormand) obsesses over the damage age has done to her body and formulates a plan with her gung-ho, hyperactive coworker Chad (Pitt) in a plan to return the memoir, which they've mistaken for confidential documents and a threat to national security, for a reward. When their plan falls apart, Linda decides that drastic times call for drastic measures and she'll get the money for her plastic surgery one way or another. And so begins an espionage adventure where no one involved knows exactly what is going on.I love how clueless the characters in this movie are. I wasn't originally so keen on this movie and it took a few viewings to really get into my head. The marketing had painted this movies as a bit goofier and it wasn't what I expected to find when I sat down to watch it. Plus, I was put off by the movie's abrupt ending (the details of which I'll spare here in case someone who reads this hasn't seen it). I remember thinking, 'This is it? That's all there is?' Now that I've seen it a few times, I really like it. It's a great ending for this particular movie. The Coens are fantastic writers and this movie is a prime example. It's sharp, funny, and tense. The characters are perfectly bizarre and the casting is perfect. The movies features a top of the line cast: John Malkovich, George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, etc. These people are over the top and just a little insane. Linda and Chad actually believe they are trapped in a spy movie scenario and react as anyone would, with only TV and movies as a source of knowledge. Shady meetings, breaking into Cox's home, and even Russiansthe two incompetent gym employees are in way over their head. Or not at all. I guess it depends on whose perspective. BURN AFTER READING is a subtler, darker comedy and might not appeal to people who usually prefer their laughs in the form of a Kevin James or Adam Sandler film.",8,0,1,13 October 2012
Watchmen," Excellent Adaptation of Moore's Novel
","I really don't understand where all the hatred for this movie is originating from. I've read a lot of negativity about Zack Snyder's adaptation of Alan Moore's amazing graphic novel but I completely disagree. Based on his 12-issue series, the film is set in an alternate 1985 where President Nixon is in his third term in office, America won the Vietnam War in less than a week, and the world hangs on the brink of nuclear war between the US and Russia. In a world where masked vigilantism has been outlawed, a former 'hero' is murdered and what starts as an investigation into his death leads into a greater world-threatening conspiracy. It's an epic movie rich with interesting characters and a complex story; in other words, not your typical 'superhero' movie.I had first read Moore's novel back in 2007 so I was exposed to his work a bit before the movie came out. I absolutely loved the book and I was not disappointed by the movie at all. A lot of the book-fans have claimed the movie isn't a faithful adaptation but I feel Snyder did a fantastic job of capturing Moore's story and characters and Dave Gibbon's visuals. Seeing as how it's only a 3 hour movie, there were some cuts to the story for time constraints but all of the important aspects were left intact.The cast did a fantastic job of capturing the characters from the novel, especially Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. Doctor Manhattan looked amazing with the blend of CGI and motion capture. You could tell Snyder used the novel itself as the storyboards, as some scenes seemed ripped right from the pages. What audiences do need to realize is the movie is rated R for a reason; this isn't the normal superhero movie aimed at families and teens. The film has enough mature content, violence, and sexuality that some people may feel the need to avoid the film; I recommend against it because you really would be missing out on one of the best films of 2009. The runtime is a bit much but the movie is fantastic and it's sure to provoke discussion afterwards.",9,1,3,29 July 2009
Man of Steel," A New Superman for a New Generation
","And so I come to the final film in the series of movies that caused the most strife in 2013, what I have dubbed the Year of Fanboy Rage. Three of the most anticipated movies of the year also caused the most Internet rampaging following their releases: STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS (which I liked), IRON MAN 3 (which I really liked), and MAN OF STEEL. You see the pattern I'm establishing here? Yes, I liked this movie too. It's got a decent story, a nice update to the hero, and an excellent villain, and I was thoroughly entertained. MAN OF STEEL is the latest in a long lineage of Superman films that spans more than thirty years so there was a lot of hope and some high expectations for many people going in. From Zack Snyder (the director of 300 and WATCHMEN) and screenwriter David Goyer (the BLADE films and Nolan's BATMAN series) have brought us a new image of the legendary Kryptonian that seems to fit with today's more cynical sensibilities. A total reboot of the film series, the movie begins with Jor-El launching his son Kal from the doomed planet of Krypton while simultaneously ending an attempted coup from General Zod. Zod is captured and sent to the Phantom Zone, Krypton implodes, and Kal-El arrives on Earth. Flash forward thirty-three years, Kal-El (now Clark Kent) travels the world going from job to job on his never-ending search for clues to his past. Just as he discovers the truth behind his heritage, General Zod, now free from the Phantom Zone, arrives at Earth with his evil Kryptonian entourage and the desire for vengeance.This is not the Superman of previous film incarnations. In hopes of recreating the billion dollar ticket sales of Christopher Nolan's BATMAN series, this Superman is dark and brooding. Clark Kent is no longer a bumbling goof; he's a chiseled statue of a man who wanders from job to job in quiet contemplation, helping those in need before disappearing again. He's got a quiet charm, a strong sense of personal honor, and a desire to be the best man he can instilled by his human adoptive father, Jonathan Kent (Kevin Costner, a nice treat). A massive tonal shift compared to all the previous films where Superman was the icon of 'truth, justice, and the American way' with a wink and a smile. The same can be said of the new Lois Lane (Amy Adams). She couldn't be farther from Margot Kidder's portrayal. The new Lois is tough as nails without any of the manic energy. This is par for the course for MAN OF STEEL. It has none of the light-hearted humor we anticipate with these films, instead opting to take itself seriously. Which is fine, if a little jarring at first. It's interesting to see a serious take on the Superman mythos. In the original films, the world just sort of accepts Superman's presence without much of a response. Alien superhero who can fly and perform amazing superhuman feats? Oh, OK. In the new movie, it tries to give it a more realistic foundation. When evidence of super-powered aliens goes public, the government goes nuts and grabs the biggest guns it can find. Superman's first appearance before the world is proving he can be trusted, and General Zod gives him the opportunity to do just that.Zod (Michael Shannon) is the best part of this film. He is one intense dude and, even better, he's three-dimensional. Zod in SUPERMAN II was nothing more than a menacing face with superpowers. He wanted to dominate Earth for no other reason than his evil nature. In MAN OF STEEL, he is fulfilling his destiny. The Kryptons in the movie had adopted a form of population control in which children were genetically created and bred to fill a role in their society (which happened to be one of Jor-El's biggest complaints, as it eliminated free will). When Zod arrives at Earth, he has vengeance in mind, sure, but he's also continuing on his predestined path as a warrior and protector of Kryptonian society. He intends on recreating Earth in Kryton's image and using an item called the 'codex' to begin repopulating the planet with his people. It just so happens that Jor-El sent the codex to Earth with Kal-El, so it provides even more reason for Zod to take out his El-related frustrations. He's a man with a purpose and he truly believes that eliminating the human life on the planet is in his people's best interest. Now that's an interest character.There seem to be three major complaints with MAN OF STEEL. The first is a spoiler from the end of the film. I'm not going to detail it here but you can find plenty of complaints about it scattered around the web. All I'm going to say is I support the movie's decision, I think it was done well, and I know what their intention in doing it was. I'm cool with it. The second is the fact that the movie contains some of the most blatant product placement I've ever seen in a film. IHOP, 7-Eleven, Sears, etc. Boom! Right there in your face. It was a little distracting. And finally, the violence. There is a lot of action in this film. More than all of the other Superman films combined. Not just simple hand-to-hand combat, we're talking epic level destruction. Metropolis and Smallville are left in near total ruin following the events of the film. This is what happens when super-powered individuals get into a scuffle, especially since one of them is new to the game and has never been in a fight. He doesn't have total control. He's just swinging wild and mean and hopes he wins. People would complain because Superman movies never had killer action scenes, because what sort of fight is Gene Hackman gonna put up. Well, here we go. Enough to cover all six movies. I dig it.",8,7,11,22 February 2014
The Revenant," Gorgeously Shot; DiCaprio Suffers for his Awards but Hardy Steals the Show
","So Leonardo DiCaprio finally wins an Academy Award for his acting and all he had to do was suffer some of the most extreme filming conditions and choke down some raw meat. I suppose, if nothing else, his dedication to the role is deserving of the praise, even if Tom Hardy completely outshines him in THE REVENANT. The film comes from director Alejandro Iñárritu, who delivered one of my personal favorite films in 2014 with BIRDMAN. It's (very) loosely based on the true tale of fur-trapper Hugh Glass with DiCaprio in the main role. The film is set in the early nineteenth century on the American frontier where Glass and his half-Pawnee son are acting as guides for a team of trappers when they're attacked by a raiding party of Arikara warriors. With many of their men dead and the Arikara on their trail, the men are forced to hike through the wilderness to the closest fort and Glass is the man to get them there. Unfortunately he's attacked by a grizzly bear and left mangled, so the team decides it best to leave a couple of men behind to tend to the fatally injured Glass while they continue on. Once Glass succumbs to his wounds, the men are instructed to give him a proper burial and start for the fort themselves. One of the men (Hardy) who volunteers to remain behind (there was a cash bonus in it for him, you see) gets a little impatient and opts to bury Glass prematurely, killing Glass's son in the process when he interferes. Helplessly witnessing the events, Glass summons his remaining strength to go after the man who murdered his son and sets off on an impossible quest across the freezing wilderness, injured and alone.THE REVENANT is a sort of film experience. The plot is very simple: a quest for revenge. There aren't exactly a lot of twists and turns to the story; it's very straightforward. It's the experience of watching Glass undergo just an insane amount of trials and tribulations to accomplish his goal that I find so mesmerizing. It is two and a half hours of DiCaprio dragging his dying, mutilated Glass through freezing temperatures while scrounging for heat and food with an angry Arikara war party on his tail. I really want to know how much of this movie was done for real because DiCaprio does some pretty gnarly things for this role. I believe I'd read somewhere that he'd really chowed on some raw fish, scales and all, for the scene where he fishes one out of the river and maybe even the hunk o' bison he very visibly gags down later on. Butwhat about that horse scene? I know Iñárritu was dedicated to capturing realism in the struggle, and that horse looked real enough. I don't know. If it was special effects, congratulations to the SFX crew that put that together because, wow, you could've fooled me. Leonardo DiCaprio must've really wanted that Oscar because, regardless of what's real and what's SFX, he went through some rough times filming this movie. Iñárritu is one of the most artistic modern filmmakers I'm aware of and I'm sure the production was rough on all parties involved to get it right. But it all serves a purpose, as THE REVENANT is one of the most beautiful (and grueling) films you'll find from 2015, a year when big budget CG blockbusters dominated the market. Most visually remarkable films nowadays spend countless hours in front of a green screen; meanwhile, Iñárritu is out in the wilderness using natural light to present an amazing tale of survival.Well, survival and revenge. Glass isn't just dragging himself back to civilization because he refuses to die in a half-finished hole in the ground. He's hunting the man who murdered his son, and that man is Tom Hardy. Hardy, who maybe should've won that Oscar himself for best supporting actor here, gets the far more interesting character. His man, John Fitzgerald, is at a bad point in his life. All he's got going for himself is the money he stands to make on this fur-trapping expedition and the Arikara threw a wrench into that plan. All he wants is to get the furs back to the fort and get his paycheck and Glass, unlucky as he may have been with that bear attack, is jeopardizing all of it. His motivations are clear though he's far from sympathetic. He's racist toward the natives (and therefore butts heads with Glass's half-Indian son long before their final confrontation) and only worried about his own needs. Once you become accustomed to his mush-mouthed dialogue delivery Hardy steals the show with his performance and I started finding myself more interested in the movie when it cut away from Glass's struggles to check in on Fitzgerald and his scheme. DiCaprio is great in the movie but, no matter what movie or role, I always look at him and see DiCaprio; Hardy is the total opposite, disappearing into whatever role he's performing. THE REVENANT acts as a solid comparison between the two critically-lauded actors and gives me further appreciation for Hardy and his talent. Between the two of them and Iñárritu's filmmaking prowess, THE REVENANT comes highly recommended from me. It can feel its length at times but even when the pace slows there's always something incredible just around the corner to recapture your interest. Moreover, you get a good sense for the blood, sweat, and tears that went into making the film from the entire cast and crew. Give it a watch.",8,0,2,24 December 2016
Hugo," Martin Scorsese's Love Letter to Cinema
","Martin Scorsese's HUGO is a family movie that will probably only cater to a niche crowd: people who appreciate movies as art (e.g. cinema snobs, though I use the term endearingly). I'm not saying it won't appeal to the general masses. It's still an interesting story, wonderfully acted, and packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. But let's face it: this isn't your average movie, it's a love letter. Scorsese has been a vocal supporter of restoring old movies in hopes they'll be saved from oblivion (rightfully so) and this movie, based on a children's book by Brian Selznick, is his method of beautifully pleading his case before millions of people who've probably refuse to watch black and white movies on the basis that they're, you know, black and white (yes, I know those sorts of people). HUGO is a film meant to bring out attention to the movies long-forgotten and remind us of the magic behind them, told through the adventure of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Hugo is an orphan whose father died in a museum fire, and he lives behind the walls of a Parisian train station. When he's not busy with his job of keeping the station clocks ticking, Hugo spends his time repairing an old automaton his father rescued from museum storage. An encounter with a curmudgeonly toy store owner and his granddaughter Isabelle will send Hugo on a journey to repair the automaton and discover its long-hidden secrets.As I mentioned, this movie will only really appeal to certain people. Scorsese fans might be put off by the fact that this film is a family-friendly adventure; it doesn't exactly fall in line with Scorsese's usual subject matter. The family crowds will probably enjoy it, but younger children will likely be put off by it's slow pacing and lack of excitement. It's not so much an adventure as a journey of discovery, and little kids might not find themselves too involved in the story. My own daughter (4, going on 5) gave it an honest try when we sat down to watch it and made it 40 minutes or so before she fell asleep. Unfortunately, HUGO will probably be one of those films that fades into the background (if it hasn't already) and find most of it's loving coming from the film school crowds. The movie incorporates a loose interpretation of the life of Georges Méliès, a stage magician and an early innovator in world of cinema who realized the potential for the new medium of storytelling. At a time when most 'movies' were just real-world situations recorded to celluloid (such as the famous train pulling into the station), Méliès created fantastic stories and mythical tales to entertain, filling his films with special effects and dramatic costuming. The movie focuses on the fact that so many of Méliès' films were lost over time and the tragedy of these classics from one of the earliest, most important filmmakers, ceasing to exist.Scorsese makes his message perfectly clear in the final half of the movie, which happened to be my favorite part of the film. Ben Kingsley is Papa Georges (Méliès) and, in the film, he is a defeated man who mourns the death of his legacy following World War I. Kingsley is perfect here and the highlight of the movie. The children in the film, Asa Butterfield and Chloë Moretz, do a serviceable job but, as is usually the case with younger actors, their performances come off as forced and wooden most times. Even Moretz, who's performances I freakin' loved in KICK-ASS, doesn't feel real here. Maybe it's just that Scorsese isn't accustomed to working with younger talent and wasn't able to bring out the best in them, but it's a shame because the two of them are the key players in the movie. There's a handful of other minor roles filling out the film with talent: Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, etc. My favorite would probably be Sascha Baron Cohen (yes, Borat) as the station inspector. With his Doberman patrolling by his side and the frame providing support for his bum leg, he was almost cartoonish. I loved him, and he was more than capable of toning down his usual eccentricity. HUGO is a movie with a lot to love, even more if you're a cinema snob. I really enjoyed it, but a slow first act and weak performances from the kids mean it's far from perfect. HUGO has my full recommendation for anyone who might want a glimpse into world of a true film-lover.",9,64,75,30 May 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Unimaginative Sequel Fails to Bring Anything New to Series...
","One of my biggest pet peeves in modern film is the creation of completely unnecessary sequels to fantastic movies. Here, we have a prime example. In my opinion, the TERMINATOR franchise would've been better off if it'd ended with the conclusion of James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2; I really wish he'd gone with his original ending showing how Judgment Day had been avoided, thereby putting a halt to future installments. Sadly, this was not the case and in 2003 Jonathan Mostow brought us the third film in the saga. The plot is nothing we haven't seen before in two other films: the future finds the human race at war with the machines (run by Skynet) and again, an attempt is made to put an end to the human resistance movement before the war ever starts. Skynet sends a new, upgraded model of Terminator to 2003 to kill John Connor, Kate Brewster (his future wife and second-in-command), and his future lieutenants. In response, the future resistance sends back another T-800 Terminator to protect him until Judgment Day passes.So, essentially what we have here is TERMINATOR 2 all over again, without some of the best aspects of what made the second film so great: James Cameron's writing/direction, Linda Hamilton, Robert Patrick, etc). The new villain, the Terminatrix, is basically a higher-tech mash-up of the first two (a weaponized endo-skeleton and a morphing liquid metal alloy) except this time it's a woman. Too much of the film feels like a rehashing of everything we've seen that most of it is forgettable until the final 30 minutes. Once Skynet goes online and Judgment Day officially arrives, the movie becomes more entertaining as we see early Hunter-Killers and T-1's rampage through a military base. The battles between the Terminators are impressive and fun to watch, but the film wanders a little too far into camp for my tastes. Some scenes, particularly the T-800's arrival in a roadside bar for ladies' night, may elicit chuckles from some but had me groaning.One element that fails to live up to the first films are the performances of the cast. With the exception of Arnold Schwarzeneggar as the T-800 Terminator (he invented the role and he really can't go wrong), the cast doesn't strike the same chord. Nick Stahl does a decent job as John Connor and seems to be a suitable replacement for Edward Furlong but Claire Danes (as Kate Brewster) spends the majority of the movie freaking out and Loken (as the Terminatrix) tries to invoke the cold, soulless killer that was Robert Patrick's T-1000 but never quite has the same effect. If a third Terminator film was really necessary, I wish Mostow and the writers had gone a little further and tried to create a unique story to grab the audience's attention, rather than feeding us the same old formula (especially with the utilization of Judgment Day as a plot point, there's so much potential there). You won't be bored by TERMINATOR 3, as it's a halfway decent action movie, but fans of the franchise who were hoping for an explosive follow-up to Cameron's T2 probably won't find what they were hoping for.",6,1,2,14 December 2009
The Shining," Classic Horror from One of the Greatest Filmmakers
","Just as he'd made his mark on the science fiction genre twelve years prior with 2001, Stanley Kubrick tries his hand at horror and suspense, creating a haunting film and an instant classic. Based on the Stephen King novel, THE SHINING follows writer Jack Torrance as he agrees to act as winter caretaker for the Overlook Hotel. He is warned of the isolation and told the roads become impossible to traverse in the overwhelming snow. Seeing an opportunity to work on his latest piece, he accepts and moves his wife and son to the Overlook with him for the duration of his stay. Jack's son, Danny, has a special ability referred to as the 'shining'. He possesses psychic abilities that allow for telepathic communication with others who 'shine', and he is able to view images from both past and future. As the winter snow arrives and the family is effectively trapped in the hotel, Danny begins suffering horrific images of the previous caretaker's family (whom had been murdered when the caretaker had succumbed to 'cabin fever') and Jack shows signs that he's lost his grip on reality. Soon, Jack is overcome with the inherent evil of the hotel and sets out to murder his family.If there's one thing Stanley Kubrick knew better than anyone, it was how to establish a film's atmosphere. From the first helicopter shot establishing Jack's initial drive to the hotel, we feel a sense of quiet isolation that will build for the next hour and a half as the Torrance family lives in this massive, grand hotel. Vast ballrooms and lounges, seemingly endless hallways, and an expansive hedge maze help make the Torrances seem truly alone as the snow drifts in and soon cuts them off from the rest of society. It's a long build-up, and might be too long for some viewers. The entire movie is almost 2.5 hours long and more than half of it is establishing life in the hotel and slowly developing Jack's madness, Danny's visions, and the hotel's latent evil as more and more strange occurrences plague the child. Once the movie kicks into gear and Jack goes over the edge, we're treated to some of the tensest and chilling moments in cinema. Jack hacking his way through the bathroom door while his terrified wife cowers in the corner, strange visions of hotel 'guests' (especially the one in the dog costume...gives me chills), and the famed elevator unleashing a tidal wave of blood. You can't go long without seeing an homage to some iconic moment from this film in some other media.Jack Nicholson is at his best here. I can honestly say his role as Jack Torrance is probably my favorite that he's ever held. No one does psychotic better than Nicholson and he goes all out here. Twitching, explosive mood swings, unrelenting violence...he mesmerizes. I could watch the last hour of this film over and over and it'd never grow old. Shelley Duvall is fine as Jack's wife, Wendy. She doesn't do much aside from scream and sob, but I suppose she does it well. Danny Lloyd does an excellent job, which blows my mind because there are so few decent child actors. Kubrick proves his mastery in directing with his ability to get the only the best from a child actor. A solid cast combines with fantastic production design and Kubrick's usual skill to create a great horror film without resorting to the 'boo!' scares and gore you'll find most modern horror hinging on. It's slow pacing and haunting atmosphere build up and lure you in for a final act where Nicholson completely owns the screen. I'm sure this movie won't be was well-received by those who demand fast-paced scares and graphic violence, but it's one of my favorites in the genre.",8,0,1,2 February 2011
"I, Robot"," The Usual Will Smith Summer Action Fare
","In 2004, the summer saw the obligatory release of its Will Smith blockbuster with I, ROBOT. Those familiar with the 'source material' that have not seen the movie, don't be fooled. Aside from a few passing similarities (the use of the Three Laws and a few character names), there is no connection between this film and the stories of famed science fiction author Isaac Asimov. The general public (which included myself at the time of my first viewing) will have no idea that the movie shares little with Asimov's work, and that's fine because it really boils down to no more than you average CGI-infused summer boom-fest. The film is set in the near future of 2035, where civilization and technology have grown immensely. The people have come to rely on the assistance of robots for everything from general labor to basic household tasks. Detective Del Spooner (Smith) is on the scene following the death of tech giant U.S. Robotics' lead robot designer, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell). Spooner's investigation into Lanning's death, an apparent suicide after crashing through his lab window to the lobby stories below, leads to a rogue model NS-5 robot named Sonny who appears to be experiencing symptoms of full sentience: emotions, dreams, etc. Following a traumatizing event in his past, Spooner has no love for robots and he's quick to accuse the robot of murder. The hitch: Lanning programmed the robots to follow the famed Three Laws that prevent robots from ever harming a human. So a robot should be incapable of murder right?The premise is pretty awesome, and if it had been handled differently it could have been an awesome science fiction thriller. Instead the filmmakers took the road most traveled and turned it into your average mind-numbing summer blockbuster. Disappointing, yes, but it doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I, ROBOT does have some pretty awesome sequences. The auto chase/robot swarm battle in the tunnel stands out as my personal favorite, but there are plenty of fun moments. It is a Will Smith movie, after all. There is plenty of action and one- liners to keep the audience interested, at least until the credits roll. My biggest complaint is that the movie as a whole is pretty generic. Director Alex Proyas and the screenwriters, whether it be from studio interference or their own negligence, failed to make anything special with such a promising concept for a sci-fi movie. It's your usual action fare that managed to rake in enough to cover its budget and a little extra before fading into the background. The plot is pretty simple and most people will see the big baddie reveal coming a mile away, especially if you've ever seen a sci-fi movie before. I, ROBOT is simple fun that most people will enjoy with minimal complaint. The product placement can be a little annoying, as it's shoved in your face pretty blatantly here. You'll know what I mean when Spooner busts out in the beginning of the movie with his 'vintage' 2004 Converse (2004...the same year the movie was releasedcoincidence? I think not.)The cast is nothing special but they manage to get the job done. Will Smith is Will Smith as Will Smith. He's no different here than any other of phoned in roles from other movies (I'm looking at you INDEPENDENCE DAY). If you enjoy a good Will Smith summer action flick, you'll be fine here. Bridget Moynahan is the fountain of expositionI mean scientistfrom U.S. Robotics that joins with Spooner reluctantly in his investigation. She's a bit of a joke. She acts as if she hasn't experienced human interaction in decades and she continues to disbelieve Spooner's 'the robot killed him' theory against the constantly mounting evidence. She's just here to feed the audience information. James Cromwell is horribly underused as Dr. Lanning, or more specifically his hologram; and Bruce Greenwood is the required 'evil businessman' and head of U.S.R. who falls under suspicion. Honestly, the strongest member of the cast is Alan Tudyk as Sonny. Tudyk provides the voice and motion capture for the rogue robot and gives him a good dose of humanity. Complimented with good CG, Sonny and the rest of the robots (as well as the rest of 2035 society) comes to life really well and continues to hold up to recent viewings. I, ROBOT is actually a fun little bit of summer action, just (and I hate to say this about a movie that tries desperately to piggyback off of Isaac Asimov) remember to leave your brain at the door and enjoy.",7,0,1,17 July 2012
Over the Hedge," Fun Animated Movie for Kids & Adults
","After having seen this movie in theaters, I have to admit: it easily ranks as one of my favorite family movies that I've seen. This is just another gem to come from Dreamworks Animation, who've had more hits than misses in their history. Based on the comic strip by Michael Fry and T. Lewis, the film revolves around a family of scavengers, led by Vern the turtle (voiced by Garry Shandling) who awaken after winter to find that their forest has been overrun by a housing development. They are approached by RJ, a raccoon voiced by Bruce Willis, who has his own reasons for wanting to assist in their hunt for food.Unlike some of Dreamworks previous animated movies, this one does not have nearly as much humor aimed at adults. Fortunately, that doesn't keep it from entertaining. The characters are lovable and the writing is fantastic. The animals' adventures across the hedge make for some really enjoyable scenes. The animation in this movie is spectacular as well. When you think about the detail that had to go into this movie, it is really impressive. The fine detail of the animals' fur and how it moves, and the massive amount of particle effects (the corn chips!) show the length that the animators went to in their effort to make this movie look good.Of course, you when looking at this movie, you have to make mention of the superb voice acting. Bruce Willis, Steve Carrell (as Hammy the squirrel), and Thomas Haden Church (Duane, the exterminator) are the highlights of this movie and they alone make it worth watching. We are also treated to great performances from Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Eugene Levy and more. Despite the few lines she is given, Avril Lavigne does a pretty good job with her first acting role.All of these components come together to make a great family movie that is great for kids and adults. There really isn't too much one can find to say negatively about this movie. Hopefully, Dreamworks will realize the strength of this movie and turn it into a franchise, continuing to bring us the exploits of Vern, RJ, and the rest of the Hedge crew.",7,1,1,13 November 2007
Wanted," Dark Humor and Non-Stop Action, Fun Summer Film
","I know there is a lot of hate going around for this movie (though it oddly manages to maintain a decent rating despite the nay-saying...) but I would really urge people to watch this movie before letting the opinions of others affect their views on it. Sure, the movie takes some liberties with plot and, obviously, physics, but it makes for a fun action/popcorn movie. It is, after all, just a movie. After seeing this film, I would say it was one of the most fun action films of 2008. It's got plenty of violence and stylized action with a dose of sexuality and a decent plot...Wesley Gibson is a miserable account manager with a dead-end life until he is approached by the beautiful Fox, who informs him that his father was a master assassin who had been murdered days before. Gibson is recruited into an assassin's guild known as the Fraternity to hunt down and kill his father's murderer.The quirk with the Fraternity is that it's assassin's have the special ability to raise their heart rate above 400 bpm, pumping incredible amounts of adrenaline into their system and giving them superhuman reaction speed...basically 'bullet-time'. So you can expect a lot of over-the-top stunts, including the ability to curve bullet paths. Why there has been a lot of complaints about this aspect of the movie, I don't know. It's not really over-used and it adds a cool element to the movie. The film has PLENTY of action throughout, though most of my favorite scenes were during the course of Wesley's training with the Fraternity. The film also has a 'twist' ending, though it isn't difficult to see the truth coming.For a popcorn flick, the film boasts a great cast. Morgan Freeman is Sloan, the overseer of the Fraternity, and it's the first time I've seen him in such a role. He did seem a little awkward with some of the rougher dialogue towards the end of the film (though I guess it's to be expected...I never expected to hear Freeman spouting 'Kill THIS motherf***a' in a film). Angelina Jolie is wonderfully sexy as Fox, though I'm biased to the point where I'd love Jolie in just about ANY role. Rounding out the primary cast is James McAvoy as Wesley Gibson; I had not seen any of McAvoy's previous work but I loved his work in this movie. He is perfectly suited to play both the meek, anxiety-ridden account manager and the elite killer he becomes. He does a great job inducing the element of dark humor into the film with his great delivery.While I've read quite a few complaints about this film, I can't understand why. It's a guilty-pleasure action film and it's not to meant to be taken completely seriously. It's just a MOVIE and a fun one to boot. When you watch this film, just sit back, disengage your brain, and enjoy the non-stop action and fun characters.",8,143,235,29 December 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best in the Terminator Series
","James Cameron's TERMINATOR 2 is a prime example of a film sequel that completely blows away the original. I was a fan of the first film but Cameron's follow-up is better in every way possible. The action is more epic, the special effects were ahead of their time, and it introduces one of the coolest movie villains ever...the T-1000. After Skynet's failure to terminate Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) in 1984, their second attempt to eliminate future war savior John Connor (Edward Furlong) has them sending an advanced liquid metal prototype model after young John.T2 amps up the action this time, with Stan Winston's SFX team returning with assistance from ILM to bring the Terminators to life. Keeping in mind the move was released in 1991, the effects are amazing. Cameron has always been on the cutting edge of special effects technology and he continued the trend here. Even now, the T-1000 looks incredible as he morphs or heals from damage (better than the effects in some modern films). In addition, the film set up for some great action sequences (my favorite of which being the escape from the mental hospital).Returning from the first film are Linda Hamilton, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Michael Beihn (in the special edition). Schwarzenegger returns to one of his greatest roles as a T-800 Terminator sent back from the future by John Connor to protect against the T-1000. Newcomer Edward Furlong is the young John Connor and seems to have no trouble running with the big dogs. Absolute best though would be Robert Patrick as the stone cold T-1000; his lack of emotion and soul-less stare gives the assassin that extra evil edge. The movie runs long at 2.5 hours (for the special edition) but you wouldn't notice as it rockets along. T2 is a sci-fi action great and (at this point) remains the best in the series; to be honest, I wouldn't have been upset if Cameron had used his original ending and given the series closure. At least we'd have known for certain it would've ended on a high note.",8,1,1,20 June 2009
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," John C. Reilly Shines in Over-Stuffed Parody of Music Through the Decades
","Here is a lesser known gem of the Judd Apatow's produced comedies. It didn't get the attention that 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, KNOCKED UP, or SUPERBAD received, but it's plenty funny. I honestly can't even remember this film going to theaters, so it must've snuck in and out pretty quietly without a whole lot of marketing. Apatow and writer/director Jake Kasdan bring the usual flavor of Apatow's comedies to this spoof of musical biopics that have flooded theaters in recent years. Everything from RAY to WALK THE LINE to Oliver Stone's THE DOORS are parodied. The film's musical hero is Dewey Cox, who takes up music after accidentally killing his brother with a machete and being shunned by his father. Dewey hits it big after his first major song 'Walk Hard' hits the airwaves and the film tackles all of the most oft repeated staples of music bio pics: infidelity, drug abuse, rehab, and the golden realization in the end. Except here it's all done for laughs with plenty of quotable dialogue, a load of great cameos, and some surprisingly good music. It's not the most amazing comedy in recent years but it's loaded with laughs.Just as with 2010's GET HIM TO THE Greek, music is a major part of the movie here and the filmmakers did not skimp out. They've gone through the trouble of giving Dewey Cox a wide selection of songs ranging from country to psychedelic and everything in between as Cox's style changes with the times. And they aren't just throwaway songs cobbled together without thought...most of the songs are actually pretty good, and nearly always funny. The crazy part: star John C. Reilly did all the vocals himself, proving not only that he should've been given leading man status a while ago (the man's easily funny enough to carry his own film) but he's got some musical talent (though I acknowledge it had to have benefited from some post-work). Reilly is great in this film and, while he's shown strength for dramatic roles, he really shines in comedy. He has a knack for the immature and goes wild as Cox struggles with the problems that come with his fame and fortune.The film's got plenty of laughs. SNL alumni Tim Meadows provides some of the best moments as Dewey's drummer Sam, who acts as Dewey's gateway introduction into every manner of drug ('You don't want no part of this, Dewey!'). My favorite part of the film comes in the 60's when Dewey joins the Beatles (Paul Rudd, Jack Black, Justin Long, and Jason Schwartzman) in India for some meditation and LSD. I wish I could say the laughs were non-stop but the film suffers from some repetition that drags it down. Dewey's on-again/off-again relationship with the love of his life Darlene (the gorgeous Jenna Fischer) and his repeated trips to rehab begin to feel like a gag that won't quit and it makes the movie feel at least a half hour longer than it should be. It becomes even more apparent if you watch the admittedly self-indulgent director's cut. It all eventually boils down to a series of gags as Dewey experiences every major decade/fad in music. There's plenty to laugh at but I think the filmmakers tried to fit too much into one movie.",7,0,0,25 July 2011
We're the Millers," A Good Deal Funnier than I Expected
","When the trailers for WE'RE THE MILLERS started making rounds, I had no intention of watching it. It just looked dumb. Another low-brow comedy catering to the lowest common denominator. Then the reviews starting creeping out and the general consensus seemed to be that it wasn't all that bad. It wasn't going to win any awards and it's doubtful to be on anyone's top ten list for 2013, but it was fun. So with that little bit of encouragement (and Jennifer Aniston as a stripper) I finally relented and, you know, I don't regret it. It's not a great movie, but it's definitely got some laughs thanks to a pretty nice bit of casting. It's a road trip movie with familial themes but it never slaps you upside the head with them. The movie is about small-time drug dealer David Clark (Sudeikis). He's robbed one night by a gang of thugs who make off with all of his drugs and cash, leaving him on boss man Brad Gurdlinger's (Ed Helms) bad side. But he's willing to forgive David and even give him a nice little payday if he'll run down to Mexico, grab a 'smidge' of marijuana, and bring it back across the border for him. David reluctantly agrees and formulates a plan of bringing the drugs across the border while attracting minimal attention: pose as a family on vacation and cross the border in an RV. But he's going to need a family. He recruits his stripper neighbor Rose (Aniston), a homeless punk (Emma Roberts), and a sheltered neighbor kid (Will Poulter) and soon the 'Millers' are on their way to Mexico.My big concern with any 'family' movie is, well, the family part. I hate overly saccharine, heart-felt moments in movies when someone realizes how much they love/need their family/loved ones/whatever. I was worried about finding that sort of sugary sap in WE'RE THE MILLERS with Sudeikis realizing how much better he feels when he drops the loner bit and starts to act as if these misfits are truly family. Andwell, OKthat does sort of happen but it doesn't shove your nose in it. It happens in small doses and usually comes with some raunchy humor to soften the blow and remind you, 'Don't worry, this is still a movie about drug smuggling and there's a stripper.' Aside from a final monologue moment from Sudeikis around the movie's climax, it's never too much. Each of the four main characters has the family deficiency issue and have their reasons to embrace their situation. David's a drug dealer and a bit of a loser, and he's reminded of the fact when he sees an old college buddy in the beginning of the movie who became a family man. Rose is a stripper but it's obviously not where she wants to be. Casey's a runaway, living on the streets with her iPhone, and Kenny's been home alone since his mom went out for a drink with friendstwo weeks ago. So, the seeds are all there for the finale we all expect but it's nice to see it's all thought out better than I expected from a drug comedy.The main reason this movie works as well as it does it the casting. I stopped watch 'Saturday Night Live' before Jason Sudeikis joined the cast but I loved him in HORRIBLE BOSSES and he was one of the funnier bits of MOVIE 43, and WE'RE THE MILLERS gives him the chance to be the main character. He handles it well. I love his sense of humor and his comedic timing, and some of his line deliveries had me rolling. The other highlight is Nick Offerman as a fellow RV vacationer whose family the Millers meet and can't seem to shake. An All-American sort of dad with a distaste for profanity and the ultimate family man, Offerman's hilarious as he goes from leading his family in campfire songs one minute and offering the Miller's the chance for a little swinging the next. His wife Edie is played by Katherine Hahn and the two work perfectly together. The rest of the cast is fine enough. Aniston still seems a little odd delivering the raunchy dialogue but she's still hot, and so is Emma Roberts. Despite any flaws, the film works because the main four (Sudeikis, Aniston, Roberts, and Poulter) had a real good chemistry. WE'RE THE MILLERS was a lot funny than I ever anticipated, even when it wasn't firing on all cylinders. It was a fun comedy to help close out the summer and it sets itself up for a sequel with the Millers that, honestly, I'm not adverse to. I'd be down for another adventure with the family.",7,6,10,22 February 2014
Apocalypse Now," A Truly Amazing Film and One of My Favorites
","Francis Ford Coppola's Vietnam epic stands out as one of my absolute favorite movies of all time. I regret that it wasn't until 2005 that I finally made an effort to see this film but I'm eternally grateful that I eventually did. I am personally a fan of the 2001 extended REDUX re-release though the original is still an amazing piece of work. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard as he embarks on a classified mission into the jungles of Cambodia to hunt down the estranged Colonel Walter Kurtz, who has broken off from the military and embedded himself deep in the jungle. He has established himself as a deity over a native tribe and the military has deemed his methods 'unsound'. Over the course of the journey down the river, we witness how the horrors of the war affect Captain Willard and the crew of the PBR Street Gang.I've seen this film countless times at this point and, even at it's over three hour run-time (for the REDUX version), it never ceases to amaze me. I really can't say enough about this film, as I truly loved everything about it: the perfect casting, the beautiful cinematography, the interesting characters, and the feeling it gives as I watch these characters slowly change over the course of the movie. Vittorio Storaro did an amazing job with this film; I loved his use of light and shadow (especially in the final act) and his use of color throughout the film. His Academy Award for this film was well-deserved. Coppola shot this entire film in the Philippines and the story of the film's creation is just as enthralling as the film itself; if you are able, I highly recommend listening to Coppola's commentary on the DVD or, if you can find it, do yourself a favor and watch his wife's documentary HEART OF DARKNESS.The heart of this film lies in the intriguing characters. From the start, the character of Willard (Martin Sheen) has had his life ruined by Vietnam. His wife divorced him and all he can focus on is the next mission. As he traverses the river, reading Kurtz's dossier and witnessing travesty after travesty of the war, we witness changes in him and we begin to wonder if he's beginning to understand the 'madness' of Kurtz. Colonel Kurtz is infamously portrayed by Marlon Brando and, despite the notorious problems on-set with the actor, I loved the cold, strong demeanor Brando brings to the character. We see what Kurtz has become through his time in the jungle and we may even begin to sympathize with him (or at least see what he meant to accomplish).The supporting characters in the film are equally as impressive as the main players with Dennis Hopper as the tripped-out photo-journalist at Kurtz's compound (one of my favorite characters) and Robert Duvall's Oscar-nominated performance as surf-enthusiast Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore of the Air Cavalry in one of the film's most memorable (and often imitated) sequences. Accompanying Willard on his mission is the crew of the PBR Street Gang, including a young Laurence Fishburne his first major film role. I loved the character of Lance Johnson (Sam Bottoms), California surf pro turn Vietnam soldier. He starts the film as your average young soldier but drugs and stress nearly make him a jungle native by the end.I truly adore this film and I hope the negativity surrounding it from some won't affect the decisions of those who may not have seen the film yet. I do recommend starting with the original theatrical and, if you find yourself wanting more, move on to the REDUX version. Every time I watch the film, I'm blown away and I hope those who are just now watching it for the first time feel the same. Enjoy.",10,0,1,4 March 2010
Van Helsing," A Disappointing Monster Mash
","Writer/director Stephen Sommers rides the line between popcorn fun and mindless crap, and his 2004 'homage' to the classic Universal monsters of early cinema leans a little too close to the later. The premise of the movie is a sound one, and an idea I wouldn't have minded seeing land in the hands of a more capable director. Instead, VAN HELSING was one of the most regrettable summer films released that year and a waste of a potentially interesting new franchise. How this movie went on the gross $300 million boggles my mind, as it's nothing but throwaway entertainment in my opinion. There is no depth, no decent characters, and I don't think it does the classic Universal monsters any sort of justice. As over-the-top as it all is, I'd consider it closer to a parody. The movie follows Gabriel Van Helsing (a relation to the original Abraham, I suppose), a monster-hunter with a mysterious past that follows orders for the Vatican in disposing of the world's most evil creatures. He is sent on a mission to Transylvania with the aid of a cowardly friar to rid the land of its vampire menace, Count Vladislaus Dracula and his three brides. The princess daughter of an ancient gypsy lineage must destroy the creature if her family is to escape an eternity in Purgatory, but Dracula has his own plans. He hopes to use the life-giving technology of Dr. Frankenstein to bring his hundreds of offspring to life andthat's it, I guess.There is a lot of wasted potential here, and it's a shame. Everything about this movie is below average, from the CG to the performances. This movie only really has one thing working in its favor: beautiful women. Unfortunately, eye candy isn't enough to build a good movie. It helps, sure, but you need more: excitement, a gripping story, strong characterssomething! Instead, VAN HELSING is forgettable at best. I watch the movie again every couple years because I see it sitting on the shelf and wonder if it's really as lame as I remember and the answer is always a resounding 'YES'. The CG effects are only slightly better than your average direct-to-cable SyFy movie. It stands out like a sore thumb and rips you out of the action, especially the cartoon vampire spawn. The dialogue in the movie is horrendous, with one of Dracula's brides (I don't remember which one, none of them were fleshed out enough to be distinguishable) even busting out with 'Too bad. So sad.' Seriously. That's the level of genius we're watching here. The story is lame and makes little to no sense. Since when do vampires procreate like living beings? And how effective is it from an evolutionary standpoint if Dracula needs Frankenstein's technology to bring them to life? Did anyone think this storyline through? The action in the movie is your usual tame PG-13 fare: bloodless violence and loads of rope-swinging. Nothing fantastic. Enough to distract you but hollow enough not to leave a lasting impression.No one in this movie seems to care. Hugh Jackman, fresh off his initial successes with the X- MEN franchise, is phoning it in. He spouts his one-liners and gives a half-hearted attempt at appearing mysterious, but you can tell he's not giving this role any effort. Kate Beckinsale is Anna, the last surviving member of the cursed gypsy family. She's hot and she's tough, and at least she seems like she's trying. The characters in the movie that get the short end of the stick in this movie are, again, the Universal monsters. Richard Roxburgh chews the scenery with over-acting that rivals Jeremy Irons in DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. He is easily the worst depiction of Dracula I've ever seen, but not to be outdone as Shuler Hensley gives him a run for his money as Frankenstein's monster. I'm cool with Frankenstein's monster having the power of speech and an exceptional vocabulary (I've never read Shelley's original novel, but I believe it was an intelligent creature), but I'm not sure why he felt the need to literally yell the majority of his lines. No joke, he delivers most of his dialogue at the top of his lungs. And the Wolfman, well, he was underused as Dracula's unwilling henchman and a poorly realized CGI creation. The movie has a few redeeming qualities in its production design and the hope it inspires that it can't possibly be bad with such an awesome premise. Alas, if you're in the mood for a monster mash-up you're probably better off turning to the classics HOUSE OF FRANKENSTEIN or HOUSE OF Dracula.",5,2,8,5 June 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Fincher is Perfect for this Adaptation
","Being a major fan of David Fincher, I was determined to see this film from the first time I saw the trailer. I had no knowledge of the novel it was based on and I was only vaguely aware that there had been a Swedish version of the same story released a few years prior. All I knew was that Fincher hadn't let me down (I don't quite count ALIEN 3), and the trailer blew me away: moody and high contrast, lightning-fast pacing set against the tune of Karen O's cover of Led Zeppelin's 'Immigrant Song', and the film was marketed as the 'feel bad movie of Christmas'. I was sold. Based on the international bestseller from Swedish author Stieg Larsson, the movie opens with journalist Mikael Blomkvist disgraced in court when he's found guilty of libel against business mogul Hans-Erik Wennerström. With his journalism career in jeopardy and his magazine on the verge of collapse, Blomkvist is approached by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve a forty-year-old mystery. Vanger's niece Harriet disappeared from their home an island in Hedestad during a family gathering when she was sixteen-years-old. Vanger's family consists of former Nazis, bullies, and businessmen, and it is Vanger's belief that one of them killed Harriet. Unfortunately, the case has been cold for many years and Blomkvist struggles to find a new angle. He enlists the aid of Lisbeth Salander, a social outcast with a torturous past and elite tech skills. Together, Blomkvist and Lisbeth find themselves hunting a serial murderer from nearly half a century ago.I loved this movie when I first saw it in theaters in 2011 and I probably should have commented on it then, as I have since overdosed on the Millennium trilogy. I have seen all three of the original Swedish versions of the films and read all three novels, so at least I feel I've been exposed to each version enough to form reasonable opinions. And my opinion is this: Fincher's film is the best version of the novel. Not that the original wasn't really good, I just feel Fincher has a better talent for visual storytelling. Whereas the Swedish version was shot very clean and felt as if it was shot as a cable movie, Fincher's is all about the style. The Swedish winter is harsh and bleak, and the colors are toned down so the whole movie has an excellent contrast that fits the dark tones of the story. Because THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is an incredibly dark tale, regardless of which version you see/read. Violence, rape, incest, betrayal, murder, and tortureFincher wasn't kidding when he advertised it as a 'feel bad movie'. His movie doesn't feel like a television drama; his feels like a living nightmare at times. Fincher has proved he's a master of visual tone (see SE7EN, FIGHT CLUB, etc) and this movie was perfect for him. I do agree though that it might have been a little presumptuous for Fincher and Columbia/MGM to remake a movie a mere two years after it was released merely because it was a foreign film and, you know, Americans don't want to read their movies.Fincher and screenwriter Steven Zaillian did just as well with the source material, keeping incredibly close to the novel and cutting only portions of the story that wouldn't be missed. I wish they had included the stronger religious undertones to the original murders because I feel Fincher could have done it well, but I understand why a lot of elements were cut. The movie already clocks in around two and a half hours, and it can feel it's length at times (especially towards the middle of the film), but it never grinds to a halt. The end of the movie goes on a bit long but there are a lot of loose ends to tie up in the story. Fincher has also done an excellent job on recasting the movie, with both Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara pitch- perfect in their roles as Blomkvist and Salander. Major respect to Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace, because they did great work on the original, but I thought Craig and Mara were perfect here. With a supporting cast including Christopher Plummer, Stellan Skarsgård, and Joely Richardson, there is a lot of great talent at work here. This movie isn't for the faint- hearted but any Fincher fan knows what to expect from this movie, and he delivers. I'm sure even most Millennium purists will agree, regardless of which version they enjoyed better, Fincher's movie is a great adaptation.",9,1,7,1 July 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Steve Carell and Judd Apatow are HILARIOUS
","I have been a fan of Steve Carell since I originally saw him as a correspondent on Comedy Central's Daily Show though I never imagined him branching out into feature films; I definitely didn't foresee him headlining his OWN movie. Carell portrays Andy Stitzer, the titular virgin who's co-workers make it their ultimate goal to help Andy get laid for the first time. Simple premise, hilarious pay-off. I can honestly (and easily) say this ranks as one of my favorite comedies; it has also brought Steve Carell, Seth Rogan, and Paul Rudd to my attention as some of the funniest actors working today.A good portion of the movie contains improvised dialogue, which helps give it a genuine feel of chemistry between the entire cast. It really was the cast that made this movie so enjoyable. Steve Carell's great performance is backed up by Seth Rogan (one of my favorite recent comedian/actors), Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch, Romany Malco, and Gerry Bednob. The combined comedic skills of this cast make it one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Keeping the movie grounded is a Catherine Keener as Andy's love interest, Trish. Keener provides some laughs, but she primarily keeps the movie from feeling completely low-brow by giving the movie it's heart.This movie also helped me realize just how desensitized I've become to modern movies. I've only ever seen the unrated DVD, never the theatrical release. Before I'd actually watched the movie, I heard all the stories about how raunchy it was and how crazy some of the scenes were. After watching it, sure I'd laughed myself crazy but I still couldn't help but wonder...what's the big deal? I'd recently discovered the 'unrated' version would've been NC-17. Whoa. Once I thought about it, yeah, I guess I can see where some of the risquÃ© moments might've been a bit much for someone who's a bit more sensitive about the subject matter (i.e. Mooj's relationship advice). So, yeah, if you're more of a conservative person, maybe you should avoid this little gem (though know, you are missing out on a hilarious film). Judd Apatow's feature film directorial debut should NOT be missed.",10,2,5,3 August 2008
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Poor Execution Weakens What Could've Been a Great Film
","All of the pieces are in place for a wicked cool movie: great cast, great premise, Boston (the band, not the city). There was no reason for this film to be anything less than awesome, but it was. The film is based on the book of the same name from Jon Ronson, regarding the US military's experimentation with New Age tactics in the 1970s ranging from phasing (moving through solid objects), invisibility, and the ability to kill a subject through staring and concentration. The film modifies the concept a bit, centering on a reporter (Ewan McGregor) who meets a man claiming to be a reactivated operative from the military's New Earth Army (George Clooney). The reporter joins him on his secretive mission into the heart of Iraq and learns the history of how the New Earth Army was formed and what tore it to pieces.Based on that description alone, I almost want to watch the film again right now. The premise is that cool, and the cast is just as encouraging. As I'd mentioned, George Clooney is Lyn Cassady, one of the original members of the New Earth Army who acts as the guide into the history and strange ways of the unit. Clooney is one of my favorite actors and the man can do funny. I love his deadpan delivery of his character's lines, explaining with all seriousness how he once killed a goat with only his thoughts or what exactly the 'sparkly eyes technique' is. His character 100% believes everything he's saying and it makes you want to believe too. Jeff Bridges was the highlight of the film as Colonel Bill Django, founder of the New Earth Army. Bridges summons a bit of the Dude (from THE BIG LEBOWSKI) as the stoned out New Age colonel dishing out mantras and encouraging his soldiers to 'be all they could be' (the proposed origin of the Army slogan). Kevin Spacey is great as the film's 'villain', Larry Hooper. Hooper was a late addition to Django's program and developed an almost juvenile hatred/resentment at Cassady's success in the program. I love Spacey here and really wish we'd gotten some more of him. The film's last major player, Ewan McGregor as reporter Bob Wilton, does a fine job but wilts against the skills of his castmates. His character is primarily around to freak out in tense moments and acts as the source of exposition so the audience can learn about the New Earth Army as he does.So how can this film turn out so mediocre with so much going for it? Poor execution. As I was first watching the film, for the longest time I couldn't actually determine what the plot was. The first hour of the movie is essentially a road movie with the history of the New Earth Army told in flashbacks. But I couldn't determine what the central conflict was? What was the goal? What exactly are we building up to? The answer: not much of anything. The final 30 minutes of the film fall a bit flat with a real weak climax. It's almost as if director Grant Heslov wrote out the first hour loaded with flashbacks, remembered later on that he needed some sort of ending, and tossed this one together at the last minute. As for the film's humor, it isn't as laugh-out-loud funny as the trailer leads one to believe. Honestly, and I hate to say this, a lot of the best moments are in the trailer (including most of Spacey's and all of Bridges'). The film does have some other funny material filling it out, but it falters at times.Still, I can't hate on the movie too much. It's got all the best ingredients; it's just that someone fudged up the recipe and it came out flat. I may not include it amongst my most loved movies (as much as I wish I could), but it's still a decently entertaining 90 minutes that's good for a lazy afternoon viewing.",7,0,1,25 May 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE Series Refuses to Lose Momentum with ROGUE NATION
","I am truly impressed that we're now five movies deep into the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE franchise and it's still going strong. It's even more impressive that, with the exception of the shallow MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II, this series has never disappointed me. The only other franchise that comes to mind that managed this sort of sustained quality after five films would be the 007 series. As much as I love James Bond, I've got to admit that Tom Cruise and his Impossible Mission Force are giving them a run for their money. Despite being the fifth movie of the series, ROGUE NATION demonstrates that they've got no intention of slowing down with the introduction of a new, far-reaching enemy that will no doubt give strife to the organization for years to come. Since the events of GHOST PROTOCOL, Ethan Hunt (Cruise) has been hunting for evidence of the existence of a shadow organization known as the Syndicate. Right as he receives confirmation of its existence, he receives word that the CIA has grown tired of IMF's antics and the global destruction it leaves in its wake and they've officially shut it down. Unwilling to abandon his pursuit of the Syndicate, Hunt goes rogue and recruits help from his few remaining IMF friends who've been absorbed into the CIA: Benji (Simon Pegg), Luther (Ving Rhames), and Brandt (Jeremy Renner). Closing in on the head of the Syndicate, Hunt must team with a dangerous double agent (Rebecca Ferguson) he's not sure can be trusted.One of the coolest elements of this M:I films is how each movie so far has had a different director at the helm, bringing their individual styles to the series while remaining true to what audiences love (gadgets, insane stunts, the perfect blend of action and comic relief, etc.). After Brad Bird's GHOST PROTOCOL (still my favorite of the franchise), Cruise brought in writer/director Christopher McQuarrie, whom he'd recently teamed with on the equally awesome EDGE OF TOMORROW. Bird and McQuarrie seem to have similar styles, so GHOST PROTOCOL and ROGUE NATION are closest stylistically in the series and I'm not complaining. The movie also continues with a recurring theme in modern espionage movies where government oversight and accountability have made classic spy work obsolete so the hero has to go off on his own. It shares this in common with the Daniel Craig era 007 films. Admittedly, I'm getting a little tired of the trope (at least KINGSMEN avoided it) but the movies are fun enough that I'm still forgiving of it. It would be nice, though, if the next M:I film would function as a straight up IMF mission sanctioned and supported by the organization where Hunt can have access to all of its resources. It would be the perfect time since the movie (sharing some more in common with 007, specifically SPECTRE) introduces an arch-nemesis for the IMF in the form of the Syndicate, or the 'anti-IMF' as Benji calls it. It opens a lot of possibilities.ROGUE NATION successfully delivers on everything you could possibly want from an M:I movie. The action is, as usual, turned up to 11. That famous stunt of Tom Cruise hanging from the side of a cargo jet that was all over the promotional materials happens in the film's cold open, leaving you to wonder how they could possibly top that in the remaining two hours. Tom Cruise is just as crazy as ever, performing his own stunts and absolutely owning the character. Cruise has had a prolific career at this point but I really feel Ethan Hunt is his defining character. He loves these movies and it comes through in the final product. The consistently funny Simon Pegg has a larger role than in any of the previous M:I adventures with Benji finally getting some real time in the field as Hunt's partner in crime and the film's comedic relief. Luther and Brandt are relegated to comparatively minor roles for the first half of the film this time, and the team is instead filled out with Rebecca Ferguson's Ilsa Faust. Faust is disarmingly beautiful and every bit as lethal as Hunt; the question is where her loyalties lie. She saves Hunt's skin a few times but she's also in deep with the Syndicate and its leader, Solomon Lane (Sean Harris). Lane has a lot in common with Philip Seymour Hoffman's villain from MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III; they're both soft- spoken sociopaths (Lane never speaks above as raspy whisper) with an army of assassins at their disposal. Lane is a criminal mastermind and Harris plays him as unnervingly creepy and always a moment away from eliminating anyone he deems expendable.Fans of the M:I series are in for a treat. ROGUE NATION continues the high level of blockbuster excitement we've come to expect from Cruise and his team. While it wasn't as consistently engaging as the superior GHOST PROTOCOL, it's right up there with the original film in terms of entertainment. I wouldn't mind returning to some of the more subtle espionage of that first film, I'm not going to complain as long as the M:I series keeps kicking all manner of butt.",8,1,3,23 July 2016
Spider-Man," Raimi Sets the Standard for Future Superhero Movies
","In 2002, the world was treated to the second big budget treatment of a Marvel comic book in the form of Spider-Man. Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his 'spider-sense'). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin.My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie. Just as in the comics, Peter is troubled by having to juggle his life as a super-hero with his life as a normal person, and one of the lessons our hero learns over the course of the film is that he can't have both. Raimi also gives us some great character development on the part of the villain, Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. He takes the time to build up the father/son relationship between Norman and his son, Peter's best friend Harry, which builds up for further stories in the future.In addition to having a fantastic filmmaker at the helm, the movie benefits from near perfect casting. Tobey Maguire is more than capable of pulling off the meek, nerdy Peter Parker as well as his web/one-liner slinging alter ego. Kirsten Dunst, while not overwhelming in her performance, was a great Mary Jane Watson and James Franco was a solid Harry Osborn. As I said, the casting was pretty much perfect across the board, right down to Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Peter's aunt and uncle. The best (and I know of many who agree with me) was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. Seriously, I can't think of another actor who pull off such eccentric, insane roles like this man. He WAS the Green Goblin and I couldn't see any other actor having stepped into that role.The movie contains plenty of action with seamless CGI inter-mixed into real-time stunts, and the story also contains a strong plot with more than enough heart to make this more than just an action flick. Aside from a few slow moments, there really isn't much to complain about with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and I think he was the first to set the standards for what the comic fans should expect from big screen adaptations of their favorite heroes.",8,0,1,1 September 2008
Collateral," Gripping Suspense and Some Great Performances
","At this point, I haven't had a good deal of exposure to Michael Mann's films. The only film of his I'd seen before this was 1986's 'Manhunter' and I wasn't all that impressed, but 'Collateral' blew me away. It's an intense, character-driven thriller that had me hooked to the screen from the Cruise's arrival at the airport in the opening scene. The concept of the film itself is simple: Vincent is a hit-man who hires/forces cab-driver Max to drive him around Los Angeles over the course of a night while he completes his assignment of wiping out five key figures in an upcoming trial. While the story and cinematography were great, it was the main characters that had my attention.As odd a person as I find him in his personal life, I have to admit that I find Tom Cruise to be an awesome actor. I love nearly every performance of his and that goes double for his role as the villain in this film. Cruise is the hit-man Vincent, and he does an awesome job of portraying the cold-blooded killer while keeping him charismatic (to an extent). The majority of the movie is his interactions with Jamie Foxx, in his role as Max. Foxx, who I've only ever really seen in primarily comedic roles until 'Collateral', pulls off the role nicely and it's fun to watch his attitude evolve from the frightened, panicked cabbie in the beginning to a strong-willed individual who takes his life into his own hands. In addition to the main characters, the film is FULL of high-quality actors/actresses in supporting roles. I have to admit, I didn't even recognize Mark Ruffalo (as LAPD Detective Fanning) or Javier Bardem (as Felix) until they were pointed out to me. Ruffalo, another actor I'm primarily used to seeing in comedic roles, is really absorbed into his role of the cop on Vincent's trail.After reading/learning as much about this movie as I have, I am seriously impressed with Michael Mann. I loved this movie from the first time I saw it, but I gained a whole new respect for it when I learned of the detail he went into as a director to develop the characters of the film into what they are. He went so far as to write up complete background stories for both Max and Vincent to give the actors a sense of the character's histories and personalities, and I think it's really reflected in the movie. I've seen that this movie does get a bit of hate from some people out there, but I fail to see why. It's more than entertaining, the suspense keeps a tight hold on you until the end, and I feel that these are some of the best performances from both Cruise and Foxx. In my opinion, this movie is worth checking out, if only to form your own opinion.",9,3,4,17 November 2008
The Machinist," A Subtle, Fantastic Independent Film
","In my opinion, Christian Bale is rising fast as one of the most respectable modern actors. After having loved his performance as the in the freshly revived Batman series, I noticed this movie on the shelf at the local video store where I worked. I'd heard bits about it from friends around school so I picked it up; needless to say, I thought it was an awesome movie. Bale is Trevor Reznik, a machinist with a nasty case of insomnia who's withering away to nothing. Soon after he meets a strange new co-worker named Ivan (John Sharian), an accident causes a worker to lose their arm and Reznick becomes the negative center of attention as a result. From that point on, Reznick's life proceeds to deteriorate further as he begins to believe he is being targeted in a plot against him by everyone in his life, all in conjunction with Ivan.Bale, who dropped 63 lbs for the role, does a superb job as the increasingly paranoid Reznick. It's almost painful to look at when you first see an emaciated Bale at the beginning of the film; the man looks like the walking dead. Throughout the movie, we watch as he pieces together clues to determine what's going on and, while some twists become evident pretty fast, it all leads up to the final reveal where everything comes together. One reason I love this movie is the fact that you can rewatch it 2-3 times and still catch subtle hints and foreshadowing throughout that point to the truth. The story is complex to where it keeps you wondering until the end, but never becomes confusing.The film benefits from great supporting performances from Sharian as the strange newcomer who seems to tie it all together, as well as from Jennifer Jason Leigh as a prostitute who is essentially Reznick's only real friend. The movie's pacing is a bit slow but it compensates by keeping the story interesting with constant developments. This film shows the talent of director Brad Anderson and motivates me to seek out some more of his previous work. Those who watch it shouldn't expect a fast-paced thriller, but a thought-provoking piece of independent film that'll prompt you to watch again just to see what you might've missed the first time.",8,2,2,27 July 2008
Bad Teacher," Meh...It's Good for a Few Laughs
","First Santa, now a middle school teacher. I feel as if we're on the verge of a new trend of bad *insert occupation here*. Bad toll booth operators, bad samurai deli clerkswhere will it end? Anyway, this is the latest from comedy director Jake Kasdan (WALK HARD) and a decently funny movie with some great moments but finds a major problem in its main character. 2011 hasn't been super strong with comedies; there have been some real good ones (BRIDESMAIDS) but most of them have been pretty forgettable (PAUL). This movie is pretty funny but it still ends on the low end of the spectrum. Cameron Diaz is Elizabeth Halsey, a gold-digging narcissist who has somehow made a career of being a middle school teacher. She believes she's found her way out with a rich fiancé to tend to her every need, but it falls apart when he finally realizes she's using him. Elizabeth is forced to return to her teaching job, where she proceeds to care even less than before. She fends off the advances of gym teacher Russell (Jason Segel) and focuses her attention on landing the new substitute teacher, Scott (Justin Timberlake). Elizabeth realizes that the only way she'll snag Scott's attention is a little self-improvement. Not becoming a decent person or anything, just a breast enhancement. From then on, she lies, cheats, and steals her way to the money she'll need for the surgery; and the only one who suffers is the good teacher (Lucy Punch) who just wants Elizabeth to do her job.In A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, young Alex (Malcolm McDowell) robs, rapes, and commits horrible acts of violence but maintains a charismatic personality that allows the audience to root for him. Elizabeth Halsey in BAD TEACHER, does not. The 'protagonist' in this movie also happens to be the least likable person in the film. As a result, the movie comes off as a little backwards. The character we're supposed to support (Elizabeth) is just a horrible person with absolutely no redeeming qualities presented until the final act of the film. And I mean none. She was a gold-digging fiancé, she's perpetually drunk/high on the job, and she coldly dismisses gym teacher Russell's advances without a glance in favor of stalking the new substitute with the massive bank account. It would almost make more sense if the film focused on Ms. Squirrel (Lucy Punch) living out her dream teaching career when trouble-making Elizabeth comes along and steals her thunder in underhanded ways. Punch should be the protagonist, and Elizabeth the antagonist. But it's not; instead we watch as the film's 'good guy' punishes the 'bad guy' for nothing other than doing her job and doing it well. Oh well, whateverit's just a comedy after all. Antiheroes can be fun and it works as long as the film is funny, which it mostly is. The movie is good for some laughs, though it's tough to be anything but distant as you watch everything going down without ever really being drawn into the story.Cameron Diaz really is the best person for this role. Not because she's horribly unlikeable (I assume she's not) but because she's got a decent comedic background in her films and she's still capable of pulling off drop-dead beauty. In BAD TEACHER, she's the teacher we all wished we'd had in middle school. She really drives the point home when she volunteers to work the school's charity car wash so she can pilfer funds. The supporting cast in this movie is what really makes it enjoyable. Jason Segel is always great as a lovable schlub (which pretty much sums up his gym teacher character) and Lucy Punch is hilariously eccentric as Ms. Squirrel. I've also got to give credit to Phyllis Smith as Elizabeth's friend Lynn. She's probably the funniest part of the movie as the soft-spoken conservative friend who wants so badly to be as cool as Elizabeth but can't bring herself to commit to the debauchery. Honestly, the main character may be crap but the movie does have some real funny moments. I just don't know if there's enough to save it from fading out shortly after watching it. If it helps, I find the movie is funnier the less sober you are when watching it.",7,18,32,12 December 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Disposable Comic Book Entertainment; I Miss Raimi Already...
","How many times must Uncle Ben die for our amusement? If ever there was a movie franchise that embodied modern Hollywood's obsession with rebooting and reimagining the past, THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is it. It's only been ten years since Sam Raimi brought the web-slinger to the big screen and helped jump-start the comic book movie craze, and it's only been five years since the trilogy came to an embarrassing end with the dud that was SPIDER-MAN 3. Now, rather than pick up where the last films left off and continue on in exciting new directions with a new director, Sony Pictures decided we might as well just start fresh. And that means a reintroduction to Spider-Man's origins, despite the fact that everyone knows by now how Peter Parker came to be New York's web-slinging superhero. I have no problem with rebooting a character franchise and handing the direction over to a new talent, but I don't see why we need to retread old ground. The entire first hour of THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN rehashes everything we've already seen in Raimi's SPIDER-MAN in 2002. Except this one is handled a bit differently, which I suppose is why it's supposed to be all right. Parker's parents are more of a central focus in his eventual decision to become Spider-Man and it's his investigation that leads him to his encounter with the radioactive spider in the first place. I'm not sure why it couldn't have been handled in a ten or fifteen minute flashback. When you think about it, Uncle Ben's death was retconned and altered the story with a few flashbacks in SPIDER-MAN 3 and it worked all right without spending an hour going over the whole scenario again.The aggravating part is, once the first hour is done and the groundwork for the Parker parents storyline is laid out, the movie shifts gears into a generic superhero storyline that loses interest. Spider-Man's first challenge in his new role is battling the Lizard. Dr. Connors was introduced in SPIDER-MAN 2 and maintained a presence through the last two Raimi movies, so we knew the Lizard was eventually going to make an appearance. I just wonder if Raimi would've handled him better as a villain. Raimi's villains were always interesting. Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus were near perfect, and even the villains in 3 weren't bad for the extent that Raimi was able to use them when crammed into a single movie. Connors has the appropriate motivation (regrowing his missing arm with cross-species genetics) and the Lizard's arrival on the scene is handled well, but his overall plan is just generic. It's a plan we've seen countless times before in other action films, both superhero and normal. As a result, the movie loses a lot of steam and only becomes interesting again when Spider-Man and the Lizard are battling it out on screen. I enjoyed the movie when I first saw it in theaters, even while recognizing that it had some problems. But each subsequent viewing has weakened it and now I'm mostly bored with the whole thing.My biggest complaint with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is that it doesn't feel like a Spider-Man movie. I know the character has been involved in some darker stories but I've always seen the Spider-Man series as a more light-hearted, fun series. Marc Webb's reboot is almost depressing. There's a lot of low lighting and dark colors. Characters always act depressed and angry. Spider-Man fits in a handful of good quips when he's doing his crime-fighting bit but the majority of the movie feels like a downer. Cheer up, people. It's Spider-Man. Leave the gloom for Batman or the Punisher. On a more positive note, the casting was great. Andrew Garfield will make a fine replacement for Tobey Maguire if the filmmakers can lay off the drama and let him have some fun. Emma Stone is a beautiful Gwen Stacy and brings the most levity to the movie. Regardless of how depressing the movie gets, her character's bright eyes and optimistic demeanor comes through. Rhys Ifans was great as Connors, though it's a shame his CG Lizard reminds me of a Goomba from the miserable SUPER MARIO BROS movie. I suppose it's just the lack of a protruding snout. The filmmakers claim they did away with the snout because they couldn't really make him speak with it. That may be so, but at least he would look like a Goomba on steroids. Martin Sheen is wasted as Uncle Ben, and Denis Leary is one of the better characters with Captain Stacy. Really, for the most part, the casting was perfect and should've made for a better movie.THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN is mediocre summer fun. If this had debuted in a year with weaker competition, it might've stood out more. But no, sorry, this movie has nothing on Whedon's AVENGERS or Nolan's DARK KNIGHT RISES. As a result, the introductory film in Sony's new Spider-Man series falls pretty flat and I doubt most people will find much more in it than throwaway entertainment before moving on to bigger and better comic book films. It doesn't live up to Raimi's first two Spider-Man films, but at least I can honestly say it was better than SPIDER-MAN 3.",7,4,9,28 January 2013
The Lego Movie," THE LEGO MOVIE is So Much Better Than it Should've Been
","When THE LEGO MOVIE first busts out the mind-melting tune of 'Everything is Awesome' in the beginning, it's not just a means of displaying how brainwashed the Lego culture is in the movie, it's a warning of what's to come over the next 100 minutes. Because THE LEGO MOVIE is, in fact, awesome. Knowing my daughter would inevitably drag me to this movie, I was dreading its release. A kids' movie; strike one. Based on a toy property with no inherent plot; strike two. Released in the month of February, the notorious dumping ground for subpar films that would bomb any other time of year; strike three. Then the reviews started trickling out and, to my surprise, they were positive. Not just positive, but a certified fresh 95% on Rotten Tomatoes. A moviebased on basic colorful building brickswas getting better reviews than many, many others. The premise is simple (which one would expect with a movie revolving around, you know, Legos). Emmet Brickowski (Chris Pratt) is your average, run-of-the-mill construction worker in Bricksburg, living his life according to the proper instructions and enjoying all government-approved forms of entertainment. One night, he stumbles across the legendary 'piece of resistance'a magical artifact prophesized to identify the 'Special' chosen one and the only thing capable of saving the world. Now a fugitive from the law, he's drawn into a world of Master-Builders with Wyldstyle (Elizabeth Banks) and Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman) where he will lead a team against the evil Lord Business (Will Ferrell) before he can end the world with his secret weapon: the Kra'gle.My first clue that THE LEGO MOVIE was going to be more than a corporate cash grab aimed at vulnerable children and their weak-willed minds was that it was directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. These men brought us the funniest movie of 2012 with 21 JUMP STREET and have shown they can handle themselves in comedy with a wicked sense of humor. This is one of those movies that's got plenty of goofball humor to get the kids laughing with some more subtle stuff that adults (especially those who were raised with the toys) will find fun in. Still, even the kids stuff is amusing enough that most adults (with the exception of the coldest hearts) will laugh along. There's some smart stuff here but it never sacrifices the chance for some slapstick. And the best part is the obvious love and respect for the toy itself present in every scene. Lord and Miller either major Lego fans or they're real good at faking it. This isn't a movie bent on selling toys but it'll sure make you itch for a set once it's over. It wasn't long after this came out that my daughter and I made our first visit to Legoland and I bought a few sets (as much for me as it was for her). THE LEGO MOVIE isn't here to sell a product, it's here to remind you why you loved it in the first place. And it all culminates in what is probably the only chink in the movie's armor, the climactic sequence where Emmet comes face-to-face with the 'Man Upstairs'. The message is a little heavy-handed but it's not overkill and it gets the point across.Everyone's going to walk away with a favorite character from this one. Will Arnett is a treat as Batman. He's one of the central characters as Wyldstyle's angst-ridden, arrogant boyfriend and a part of Emmet's Master-Builder team. He's essentially an 80's high school movie jock and one-third of the movie's love triangle. Liam Neeson's one of the best with his Bad Cop/Good Cop, Lord Business's main enforcer with a split personality and a penchant for roughing up chairs when he gets agitated. His action film persona where he grumbles threats and opens generous cans of whooperm, buttonly make his high-pitched, super-friend cop that much funnier. Personally, I loved Benny the '1980's-something spaceman'. He's voiced by Charlie Day and he's just as spastic as you'd expect, and all the poor guy wants is to build a spaceship. There are Lego cameos everywhere in THE LEGO MOVIE, bringing together characters from countless properties (both original Lego and licensed). Some of the funniest bits in the movie stem from random cameos and there's one about halfway into the movie that I refuse to spoil here but, just know, it's pretty cool. And the voice cast is almost as extensive. You could miss entire chunks of the movie just trying to pinpoint the voice actors, many of which only make the briefest of appearances. One I would've missed was Nick Offerman as Metal Beard; I never would've figured that one out until I paid closer attention to the end credits.With so many easter eggs and blink-and-you-miss-them gags, I've found that THE LEGO MOVIE has some staying power. Every time I watch it, I'm finding something fun I'd missed before. As one of the few family movies that isn't downright painful for parents, this is an easy recommendation from me. With so much a movie like this had working against it from the start, THE LEGO MOVIE is definitely what I'd consider the surprise hit of 2014.",9,0,3,27 September 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Another Fantastic Turn from Matthew McConaughey
","As I mentioned in my comments for Ron Howard's RUSH, 2013 was a year full to the brim with great films inspired by true stories. From the Formula-1 raceways of RUSH, I moved forward nine years to the tale of one Texas man's battle with HIV and how he came to help others with the same affliction. DALLAS BUYERS CLUB was another film whose positive critical buzz drew me in. Quick bit about me: I'm not usually attracted to 'factual' dramas because I know the plots are generally manipulated by the filmmakers to amp up the tension. Very few remain truly faithful to the source events and, based on what I've read about DALLAS BUYERS CLUB, it's no different. But I'm still a sucker for a good movie and I'd been reading about Matthew McConaughey's performance for a few months prior. It's the tale of Ron Woodroof (McConaughey), a Texas man's man who spends his days as an electrician and his nights chasing hookers and booze. When Woodroof begins suffering from dizzy spells and blackouts, he goes for a checkup and is informed that he's infected with HIV. Pretty nasty case, too, with a projection of only 30 more days to live. When he finally comes to terms with his condition, he tries to get into the hospitals drug trials for a new HIV treatment known as AZT. He's cast aside and refuses to give up, doing his research and finding new sources of experimental treatments from around the globe. Recognizing the potential to help others and make some serious cash, he starts the Dallas Buyers Club to distribute these drugs to other patients while he continues to dodge the ever-looming FDA who seeks to shut him down.I don't know which elements of DALLAS BUYERS CLUB are true and which aren't, but I know that the story and characters, crafted by writers Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, are engaging. Everything you may have heard about Matthew McConaughey's performance is true. He's really given his career a much needed overhaul, going from generic romantic comedies to much more challenging roles in movies like KILLER JOE and DALLAS BUYERS CLUB. I'd almost forgot he could actually act until last year. Woodroof is another character that doesn't fit the usual hunky goofball role he'd come to be associated with. At the start, Woodroof is thoroughly unlikeable. He's racist and homophobic. He's a perpetual drunk who loves hookers and gambling, and he embodies what most people probably imagine when thinking of a Texan from the mid-eighties. It was not a tolerant time. When he's thrust into the position of a social pariah, he manages to work past his prejudices and becomes a hero of sorts for those with AIDS and no means of managing their illness. His partner in crime is Rayon, a transsexual played by Jared Leto. Rayon is a colorful character and Leto's been getting a lot of attention for his performance. He really does a great job and disappears into the character (which isn't hard with the amount of makeup and costuming) but he didn't fully hit his stride until the second half of the film where Rayon's falling apart at the seams due to the virus as well as side effects from AZT treatment. When Rayon hits rock bottom, you start to see why Leto was so popular for supporting actor nominations.When you stand DALLAS BUYERS CLUB against other 'factual' films from the year, it doesn't quite achieve the same level of quality and I believe that to be the case because the story itself just isn't as interesting as those of RUSH or 12 YEARS A SLAVE. This movie is very much a character-centric piece and the plot sort of shambles along while McConaughey and Leto do their thing. When you boil it all down, it amounts to Woodroof finding innovative new ways of dodging the FDA regulations and the FDA catching up to him, throwing as many obstacles in his path as legally possible. As a result, the movie hasn't got a very smooth pace and the ending sort of sneaks up on you. Still, it paints a vivid picture of the AIDS epidemic of the eighties and serves as a reminder that pharmaceutical companies prioritize profits of saving lives. The film makes a devil of the FDA, as a soulless government agency that only cares for enforcing the rules without worrying about how it affects the population. Based on what I've learned of the modern food industry and the FDA's part in it, I'd wager to say much hasn't changed.Accurate or not in it's portrayal of Woodroof's life and struggle, DALLAS BUYERS CLUB is an inspiration. It's one of those films that comes along every so often to give us hope that one man can stand up and challenge government bureaucracy and make ripples large enough to affect the lives of millions. It's loaded with powerful performances (except for Jennifer Garnershe didn't pop as anything special amongst all the other more engaging roles). It's a powerful movie and serves as yet another example of McConaughey's strength as an actor. Check it out if you haven't.",8,1,1,2 July 2014
Goon," A Hilarious Feel-Good Underdog Movie
","I am not a hockey fan. I've never watched it, never attended a game, and I could probably only name one or two NHL teams if pressed. But I am a fan of Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg so, hockey fan or not, I knew was giving GOON a chance. I'd read a really positive review of it out of last year's Toronto International Film Festival but, of course, it never got a wide release so I had to wait. It was worth the wait because I really, really liked this movie. The characters feel real, the gags are funny, and the action is brutal. The plot is pretty simple when you break it down: Doug Glatt (Sean William Scott) is a bouncer for a local dive bar and the black sheep of his family, with both his brother and father maintaining successful medical careers. Doug's just not smart enough to continue in their line, but he is great at fighting. His brutal talents are witnessed by a local hockey coach when he batters a player from the local Orangetown Assassins and Glatt's hockey career begins when he's trained as an enforcer. His role is to protect the more talented players on his team, usually through bloody beatdowns. Glatt's career takes off and he finds himself in the minor leagues where he tries to help inspire the Halifax Highlanders to their first championship in years while building to the eventual battle with legendary enforcer and one of Glatt's heroes, Ross 'the Boss' Rhea (Liev Schreiber).This movie is so well done that I was almost tempted to start watching hockey until I learned that the violence has been toned down a lot in the past decade or so. Even though the Highlanders' championship aspirations are only a subplot in the scope of the movie, I found myself excited during the games and had to remind myself that their success isn't the end goal of the movie. It's all about Doug rising through the ranks and finding his own form of success in his life. Regardless, the hockey scenes in this movie are pretty awesome. The fights are the highlight though, and they can be savage. Doug is a beast. He may be the worst hockey player in the league but he can dish a beating as well as he takes them. Everything builds up to the big final confrontation where the new fan favorite fights the retiring legend, and it will have you flinching. But the movie is more than just rearranging faces; it's a genuinely funny comedy. None of the gags felt forced or stupid with one major exception: Jay Baruchel. Yes, I said I was a fan but that doesn't mean he can do no wrong and his character is one of the most annoying I've seen. Baruchel is Pat, Glatt's best friend and host of a public access hockey show. He's loud, vulgar, and constantly in your face when he screams nearly every line. Oddly enough, he's the weakest part of the whole movie.The casting for the movie was perfect (I'm assuming Baruchel's character was just written to be incredibly annoying). Sean William Scott has more talent than I've given him credit for in the past. He's played so many buffoons in the past, and it's good to see him come across as a little more down to earth. Sure Doug is dumb, but he's also endearing, noble, and endlessly optimistic. He's a great guy; he just happens to be really talented at throwing punches and so that's what he does. Scott's character is what makes this movie so effective. You feel for the guy and you really want him to come out on top, whether it be in his hockey career or his chasing local nymphomaniac Eva (Allison Pill). Eva, on the other side of the spectrum, is not a good person and she admits to this, but she sees something irresistible in Doug's naivety and good nature. She's cute without being hot and, despite her glaring flaws, you want Doug to get the girl. His teammates are where the real laughs come from here: Kim Coates (team manager Ronnie Hortense), Richard Clarkin, Jonathan Cherry, Ricky Mabe, and especially George Tchortov and Karl Graboshas. Aside from Ricky Mabe, I haven't really heard of any of them, but they all have hilarious chemistry as a team. GOON is one of those feel-good movies and it does it's job well, even for someone who couldn't care less about hockey like me.",9,5,6,9 September 2012
Now You See Me," All Flash and No Depth; Average Summer Fare
","I'm not sure what I was hoping for with NOW YOU SEE ME, but I should've known going in that I shouldn't expect a real tight, suspenseful heist film. That might be what I wanted, but director Louis Leterrier was more interested in putting out another flashy summer action movie. The movie's not much more than a flashy spectacle that attempts to shoehorn a big 'twist' into the end of the film, but it all left me feeling a little disappointed at the end. As a big fan of THE PRESTIGE, I have a nasty tendency of going in to movie's centering on magicians with high hopes that it will strive for that level of drama in the world of magic. This year I've been let down twice: this and THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. Though Leterrier's magical heist film is nowhere near as derivative as that Steve Carell dud. Instead, it's just your average 'turn off the brain' summer entertainment. NOW YOU SEE ME opens with introductions to four low-level magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is a semi- successful street magician, Henley Reeves (Fisher) is Atlas's former assistant who's gone on to create her own act, Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is a mentalist struggling to regain his former fame, and Jack Wilder (Franco) is a street-level sleight-of-hand artist. Each of them receives a mysterious invitation that soon leads to an immensely successful show together as the Four Horsemen. When their show in Las Vegas concludes with the seemingly magical theft of millions of Euros from a bank vault in Paris, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) is assigned with an Interpol agent (Laurent) to put an end to it before the Horsemen strike again.There are a couple problems I have with this movie. I was hoping, if nothing else, that it would treat the magic in the movie as true illusions. I loved the idea of stage magicians using their craft to dazzle audiences with their show while baffling the authorities with their crafty heist jobs. The movie abandons any hope of that by incorporating CG effects into the illusions, giving them an otherworldly appearance and ruining any feeling of grounding in reality. During the first Horsemen show in Las Vegas, Leterrier uses some horrible CG effect for some floating black clothes in the reveal of the 'transporter' and reinforced it in New Orleans when Henley takes flight in a giant bubble over the audience. Feasible? Maybe, but it felt like a little too much and suddenly the magicians didn't feel real. Next is the whole concept of 'The Eye'. The Eye is some secret society of magicians dating back to ancient Egypt that was dropped into the plot as some sort of motivation behind the magicians' heists. I don't know about anyone else's opinion, but personally I would've enjoyed it more if the magicians weren't supposed to be anti-heroes but really were just incredibly talented thieves that used their shows and complex illusions to get away with incredible robberies. The Horsemen's selfless acts are secretly manipulated and funded(?) by an unknown fifth figure a fifth Horseman. The reveal at the end of the film of the fifth Horseman's identity is one I saw coming but also hoped I was wrong about because it was just too lame. In addition to being somewhat disappointing, it also raised a lot of questions/problems about everything that had preceded it. Not to mention all the logistical problems behind it.But, if you're ready and willing to shut down your brain, NOW YOU SEE ME is a decently fun two hours. There's a fair bit of action in the film and director Louis Leterrier has proved skills in the genre (yes, I liked THE INCREDIBLE HULK). There's a pretty wicked fight scene about halfway through the film between Ruffalo and Franco that ends with the obligatory overblown car chase every successful summer blockbuster needs. And the glimpse into the Horsemen's more grounded illusions and how they pull off some of their heists is pretty cool. Plus, you really can't complain with such an awesome cast on hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Melanie Laurent. It's a pretty stacked team here. If the material were stronger, we'd probably have a real killer movie. The material doesn't live up to the potential of bringing all these choice actors together. Still, they bring their usual quality performances to the game and that alone is enough to earn the movie some brownie points. All things considered, NOW YOU SEE ME balances it strengths and weaknesses to be a serviceable summer action movie. Set your expectations to mid-level and you'll be fine. With a sequel on the way and that lame fifth Horseman reveal finished, maybe the filmmakers can wow us with the next inevitable movie.",7,1,2,8 November 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," The Triumphant Return of Bryan Singer to the X-Men
","Fox receives a lot of aggression for their treatment of Marvel's comic properties and, while some of it is well founded, people seem to forget that Fox has also done really well with their X-Men series. They've made some serious missteps (X-MEN ORIGINS) but they've also done more good than harm, releasing some seriously awesome X-Men films (e.g. FIRST CLASS, X2). When director Bryan Singer returned to the franchise and announced he was doing a time-travel plot that would bridge the casts from his and Matthew Vaughn's films, I knew we were in for something great. And I was not disappointed. The film opens in the near future where mutantkind has been hunted to near extinction by a force of adaptable murder-machines called Sentinels. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his few remaining X-Men come together with one last ditch effort to end it: Kitty Pride (Ellen Page) will use her powers to send Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) consciousness decades into the past where he will need to connect with a younger, troubled Xavier (James McAvoy) and Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and convince them to aid him in preventing a pivotal assassination that set the dystopian future into motion. Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) has gone rogue since losing touch with Xavier and Magneto and she plans to murder Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage), a mutant-hating industrialist who's Sentinel program goes on to all but destroy the world's mutant population. DAYS OF FUTURE PAST is easily the most epic X-Men film, uniting the past and present to save the future.This movie is amazingly fun. I love the X-Men movies (well, maybe not X-MEN ORIGINS) so I was pumped going into the film, and I loved what I saw. As much as I loved Vaughn's FIRST CLASS, I miss the original team and this is the closest we've gotten to a new movie with them since 2006. I would love a new movie focusing solely on them but it was still cool to see Storm, Kitty Pride, Iceman, and Colossus (in a role limited to punching) in action again. Plus, no spoilers, but the end of the movie left me smiling as a fan. We're also introduced to some new faces that I'm hoping get developed more in the future. After a handful of films, we finally meet Bishop (Omar Sy) but he doesn't get a chance to do much; we get to see his powers in action and that was a good start. Blink (Bingbing Fan) is a breakout character in the sense that her power of portal creation made for some fantastic action sequences. The future Sentinels were a little too plain for my tastes. I loved their ability to adapt to the mutant powers and coordinate in slaughtering their targets but their shape-shifting design was too generic, reminding my of the Destroyer from THOR. The future sequences, bleak as they are, are primarily action sequences as the surviving mutants try to defend Kitty and Wolverine but the real juicy stuff is happening in the '70s.As is the case with most of the X-Men films anymore, Wolverine is a key component to the story but I'm happy to report that he isn't the central character. Just like FIRST CLASS, this is Xavier and Magneto's show with some Mystique thrown in for flavor. Xavier of the '70s is a drug-addled man in a never-ending pit of depression. Beast (Nicholas Hoult) has developed a serum that allows the Professor the use of his legs (following the events at the end of FIRST CLASS) but removes his mutant power of telepathy. When Wolverine finds him in the past, he is a broken man and there's a nice role-reversal as Wolverine must now guide Professor X instead of the other way around. Magneto is still the idealistic criminal, though incarcerated under the Pentagon forwell, that part is best left to the movie to reveal. His escape results in the best sequence in the entire movie when Wolverine and crew recruit a young speedster, Quicksilver (Evan Peters). I was one of the fans worried about Quicksilver's use in the film, knowing that it was quick on the heels of the announcement that Marvel would be using the character in AGE OF ULTRON and fearing this was just a way for Fox to spit in Marvel's face. Plus early character images looked sort of goofy with the costuming. Again, I was wrong and Quicksilver was pure awesome.I could spend well more than the allotted words praising everything I loved about this movie. I still haven't mentioned Dinklage's awesome performance as Trask or the wicked Vietnam scene. In contrast to my earlier comments on the future Sentinels, the originals from the '70s are much cooler, staying closer to the original comic design. The film has its flaws but they're overshadowed with everything I loved about it. Bryan Singer returned to the franchise he brought to life and essentially apologizes for all the garbage that happened while he was away. For that alone, DAYS OF FUTURE PAST has my fandom but it doesn't hurt that it's just an awesome movie to boot.",9,0,0,1 April 2015
Captain America: Civil War," A Solid, Exciting Adaptation of Marvel's Civil War
","Comic book superhero movies have been blowing up theaters for almost twenty years now. Marvel has been reigning champion for more than half that time, and DC has stepped up their game with their opening moves toward building a cinematic universe. What I'm saying is we've seen a lot of costumed heroes beating up on supervillains and foiling their plots at world domination/destruction/etc. at this point. To keep things fresh, the studios have to find ways to change it up and 2016 saw not one but two different films focused on superheroes turning their fists on their brethren (well, three if you include X-MEN: APOCALYPSE where Storm was temporarily on the villain's team). While Batman's battle with Superman failed to be the explosive intro to Warner's eventual JUSTICE LEAGUE they might've hoped it be (especially critically), the civil war in Marvel's cinematic universe went to show that you could put cram all of your existing superhero roster into a film, go so far as to introduce a few more new characters, give them all a reason to brawl, and still come out with box office gold. CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR is Marvel's most ambitious film to date and had every reason to fall apart, but the team behind the camera managed to put together one of the best entries in the studio's canon. It manages to avoid the increasingly cliché superhero storytelling tropes and also shakes up the inter-character dynamics amongst the dozen or so heroes we've come to know.Civil War is the only run of comics I've made a point to read in its entirety. I read all of the core issues as well as all of the individual hero runs that went alongside it. Needless to say, I was beyond excited at the announcement that Marvel Studios would be tackling the story arc for the third film in the Captain America series, but I was also worried because there was just so much that happened in the comics that I feared a version boiled down to two or so hours wouldn't do it justice. In the end, having seen the finished product, I love it. It doesn't hold up as well under multiple viewings. On my first viewing, I thought it the best Captain America film and one of the top Marvel films period. Since then, I've come to accept that I was a bit blown away by the spectacle (that airport battle!) and I've adjusted my opinions and recognize that, while it's most certainly awesome, there are still better Marvel films. I have had some regrets with the film though. In the comics, it goes a little darker at the midpoint when the heroes on both sides realize the consequences of their actions (the movie pulls it's punches and there are no tragic long-term consequences of their in-fighting) and I still sort of wish they'd kept the original dramatic end from the comics (you know the onewith Captain America) because of the impact it would've left.I understand their reasons for the changes from comic to screen (can't shake up the status quo in this money machine too much) but I would've really appreciated the studio showing it was willing to make a drastic change for dramatic impact in service of the series. Instead, injuries will heal and, while there's still a rift in our Avengers by the end of the film, we know they'll reconcile when it comes time to fight Thanos in INFINITY WAR. So, in the long run, their squabbles don't mean much but they do make for a great movie. And we got to meet some new characters! CIVIL WAR introduces us to Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland). Boseman gives a strong performance as T'Challa/Black Panther but isn't given a whole lot to do other than brood and chase vengeance; regardless, there's the seed of a great new hero for the cinematic universe and it's increased my interest for his upcoming standalone. Spider-Man, on the other hand, was the big draw for me. I know I wasn't alone in my excitement for his arrival in the MCU after the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN franchise fell to pieces. Tom Holland is pitch perfect as the web-slinger and the filmmakers have captured the spirit of the character better than both Sam Rami and Marc Webb ever managed. It's no surprise that Marvel themselves would be the ones to do the character justice, even if it's only for an extended cameo in the middle of the film.Despite all the superhero-on-superhero violence and new hero introductions, this is still a Captain America film and the main through-line still focuses on Captain America and the Winter Soldier. It somewhat continues from WINTER SOLDIER in that Bucky Barnes is still a wanted international criminal, though he's recovered enough of his memories that he isn't a threat, and Steve Rogers still has his back. The Winter Soldier is accused of bombing a meeting of the United Nations and Captain America goes rogue to clear his name; meanwhile, a botched Avengers mission in Africa ends with civilian deaths and the United Nations moves to pass the Sokovia Accords, a program that would require government registration of all vigilante heroes. It's Rogers' willingness to disobey the Accords in an effort to clear Barnes' name that leads to the dispute between him and Tony Stark/Iron Man, whose guilty conscience leads him to give his full support to the Accords. So the spectacle and abundance of heroes are great, but this is still a Cap story at heart and CIVIL WAR is another home run from the Russo brothers, in what originally started as my least anticipated Marvel film franchise but has since become one of its strongest.",8,0,3,10 September 2017
American History X," A Powerful Message About Hate
","Here is a film with a powerful message. In his first feature film, Tony Kaye has created a gripping drama that tackles the subject of hate and racism in America. Edward Norton is Derek Vinyard, a charismatic leader in a White Supremecist organization in Venice Beach who is imprisoned for murder. Upon his release, he intends to turn his life around but discovers that his younger brother has fallen in with the same Neo-Nazi organization. A fantastic cast and a strong message come together in this ever-relevant film.Edward Norton deserved more awards for his performance in this movie. For those wondering why I easily consider Norton one of my favorite actors in modern film, Kaye's movie is a prime example. Norton is such a strong performer that one can actually start to understand the racist rhetoric he spouts in the film and for an example of the passion/animosity he summoned for the role, one only needs to see the look on his face when Vinyard is arrested. While Norton is definitely a powerhouse, the film boasts an equally impressive supporting cast including Edward Furlong, Avery Brooks, Beverly D'Angelo, Stacey Keach, and Elliot Gould.The film portrays a powerful message of how hate and violence will only lead to further hate and violence. The main characters are led to discover how meaningless the cause they fight for actually is and the repercussions of their actions. The final few minutes caught me off guard, as I definitely wasn't expecting the ending. While some feel the end to be meaningless, or even counter-productive to the film's theme, I disagree (but I hesitate to go into greater detail at risk of spoilers). Your best bet would be to check out the film and form your own opinion, as the film is sure to inspire thought.On one final note, did anyone else find it odd to see Ethan Suplee in the role of a hate-monger? To his credit though, he did a great job.",8,0,1,16 February 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Cool Cast + Complex Heist = Fun Flick
","No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never gets old. Steven Soderbergh has remade a classic and updated the style for the twentieth century. The movie centers on freshly-paroled Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his plot to rob three Las Vegas casinos in one night. The movie grabbed me at the first scene and I was entertained until the end. The two components that make this movie what it is are the spectacular cast and the intricate heist plan.For a movie with thirteen characters, Soderbergh and screenwriter Ted Griffin did a great job of giving each enough screen-time and personality to make them each interesting. Clooney and Brad Pitt are charismatic as usual in their roles as the heist's ringleader and primary accomplice. Andy Garcia is cold and calculating as the owner of the targeted casinos. Though, some of the best performances come out of the supporting cast. A lot of the movie's best scenes feature Bernie Mac, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, and Elliot Gould. Julia Roberts is a bit under-used in her role as Tess, Danny's ex-wife, but makes for a pleasant distraction. Playing just as large a role as any person in this film is the setting, Las Vegas. We are treated to great visuals of Vegas and it gives the movie a grander, flashier vibe.The heist in this movie is definitely complex, and there are still parts I'm not too clear on. I also felt that they got a little too high-tech during the vault break-in (i.e. the little 'knock-out' disc and the getaway van). Other than a couple hiccups, the heist was fun to watch build up and come to fruition. Soderbergh did a great job revealing little details throughout that seem insignificant until you see the end result.Steven Soderbergh's remake of a classic caper makes a great popcorn flick. It's got sharp humor, great performances, and an intelligent design that almost makes you think, 'That just might work...'. There may be a couple plot holes but that never slows the movie down. So, check this out if you haven't already...and keep an eye out for the cocktail waitress that gets clothes-lined during the chaos. It's probably one of the funniest images in the whole thing.",8,0,1,4 December 2007
The Conjuring 2," A Superior, Scarier Film than the Original CONJURING
","I don't generally put a whole lot of faith into horror sequels. More often than not, they're just trying to recreate the success of what made the first film popular and fail to bring anything new to the table. So many of them are unapologetic cash-grabs that I often won't pay attention to news that sequels are in the pipeline, even when I enjoyed the first film. I thought INSIDIOUS was a creepy, fun little film but I never once cared about the second chapter and still haven't bothered to see it. Until just a moment ago, I was completely unaware that there has, in fact, been a third chapter and there's a fourth in production. Speaking of James Wan and Patrick Wilson, the first CONJURING was another decent horror. I think it was over-hyped and I might've gone in with my expectations a little high, but I enjoyed it. I had zero interest in the idea of a second film, believing they'd gone the route of every other successful horror with a seemingly never-ending explosion of sequels and spin-offs (for the record, I never saw ANNABELLE and have no desire to do so) but I was caught off-guard when THE CONJURING 2 started receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and in the end I'm glad I did because I'm actually of the opinion that THE CONJURING 2 is superior to the first film. So I suppose it's a rare exception to the rule.THE CONJURING 2 revisits the case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two of the most famous paranormal investigators. It opens with a glimpse into their involvement in the investigation of the Amityville house, where Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) conducts a séance and comes face-to-face with some sort of evil spirit in the form of an evil nun. Unlike the first film where their Annabelle investigation was just a cold open to introduce the pair in action, the nun becomes an integral part of THE CONJURING 2, tormenting Lorraine long after finishing at Amityville with visions of Ed's (Patrick Wilson) death. It's her confrontation with the nun and these spectral threats that lead her to swearing off hands-on investigations, and she and Ed decide to limit their activity to seminars and interviews. Meanwhile, in England, a new supernatural occurrence has taken up residence in the home of a single mother and her four children. It's set its sights on the youngest daughter, Janet (Madison Wolfe), and it's not long before her over-stressed mother takes notice and affirms that this isn't a child's prank. Her family is being tortured nightly and Janet is suffering more and more as the entity breaks her spirit in hopes of possessing her body for its own purposes. The misery of a young child proves too much for Lorraine to turn away, and she and Ed jet off across the Atlantic to verify the poltergeist's existence and hopefully get the Catholic Church involved in exorcising the spirit.The Enfield Poltergeist is apparently one of the more famous Warren investigations. I wasn't familiar with the details of it prior to this movie but I had seen the photographs of Janet's supposed levitations referenced before in my limited readings on the paranormal. Of course, the whole situation has been debunked as an attention-grabbing hoax but, for the purposes of this movie, it's all treated as gospel and it makes for a great movie. I remember the first film leaving me uneasy in a dark house when it ended but THE CONJURING 2 was way more effective at leaving me shaken. James Wan is a talented horror director and one of the few out there that can put together a strong ghost story without the reliance on shocking gore or over-used jump scare tactics. He uses camera lenses, lighting, film score, and the performances of his cast to build a sense of dread in a way that many other modern horror filmmakers wish they could. There's a little bit of questionable CG in the film when the spirit takes the form of a children's nursery rhyme named the Crooked Man but it's a minor misstep and I can forgive its cartoonish appearance because everything else works so well. The first CONJURING seems to have soaked all the hype but CONJURING 2 is the one that gets my respect. Fans of the first one won't be disappointed and, for once, I'm eager for a horror sequel and hope they continue digging through the Warrens' files with a CONJURING 3.",8,0,0,26 August 2017
Tropic Thunder," One of the Funniest Films from 2008...
","I've noticed that most of the reactions I've gotten from people regarding this film were at one extreme or the other: they either love it or hate it. I'm surprised at some of the negative feedback I've read for this movie, seeing as I found it to easily be one of the funniest movies of 2008. Every time I watch this film, I enjoy it more and more as I find something new to laugh at. The film follows a cast of problematic actors in Vietnam and the director who's having a hard time keeping his film together; so, as a last resort, the director takes his actors into the jungles to give it an aspect of 'realism' and the men find themselves pulled into a battle with a local drug cartel.I guess some people have a problem with the fact that the movie isn't what most people are expecting. For those going to the film for a general spoof on war films, you're barking up the wrong tree. While this movie does that to an extent, it's primarily a satire of the Hollywood system and all those involved...self-centered actors, sycophantic agents, iron-fisted studio heads, etc. The humor in the film is derived from the clashing of these outlandish personalities and their need to overcome their petty insecurities and crutches to survive. Of course, the film does have plenty of the raunchy humor that's expected, but a lot of the funniest moments come from the situations and the awesome performances.Seriously, this movies has one of the funniest casts I've seen in a while. Ben Stiller (who also directed and co-wrote) is fading action superstar Tugg Speedman who sees this film as a means of reviving his career. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of Stiller's work but this movie changed my opinion on that. Jack Black is Jeff Portnoy, an actor famous for multi-role, gross-out comedies and a heroin addiction. While a lot of people though Black's role was pointless here, I thought he added some great moments ('Let's do the yak...'). My personal favorite in the film is Robert Downey Jr. as Kirk Lazarus, the award-winning actor who goes through a pigmentation-altering surgery to play the squad's leader. Downey stole every scene he was in and was easily the funniest aspect of the movie with his character's racial incompetence (especially when he got into it with Brandon Jackson's Alpa Chino). The movie also has an awesome supporting cast, particularly Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Nick Nolte...Nolte's was freakin' awesome when he went nuts with the flamethrower.As one of my favorite comedies from 2008, I've completely recommend watching Stiller's film. Just make sure you know what you're going into and watch it for what it is. As long as you can do that, this movie is hilarious (especially the director's cut of the film). Everyone involved in this film did an awesome job and I really hope to see them all pull together in the future for further projects.",9,0,3,30 November 2008
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," A Total Geekgasm
","From the moment the movie opens with an 8-bit rendition of the Universal Pictures logo, you know what you're in for. This film is a major geekgasm, with constant references to classic video games scattered throughout, and anyone who grew up with the classics on NES, SNES, SEGA, etc. are going to love it. For those somehow unaware, the movie is based on the seven-issue series of graphic novels written by Bryan Lee O'Malley and it's directed by the awesome Edgar Wright (SHAUN OF THE DEAD & HOT FUZZ). Scott Pilgrim is the bass player for a struggling underground band and, as the film opens, is dating a high school girl. That is, until he meets the literal girl of his dreams: Ramona Flowers. Scott immediately pursues Ramona but, if he is to date her, he must defeat her seven evil exes. As Scott and his band, Sex Bob-omb, search for their big break and a record contract with the mysterious Gideon 'G-Man' Graves, Scott begins a series of fights to the death with Ramona's exes while fending off the advances of his jilted ex-high school girlfriend Knives Chau.The film is an absolute blast and one of the most fun films to come out in the summer of 2010. It might suffer a bit from those who aren't as in to the game references and doses of hipster humor. I thought it was a great movie, but it could've been better if broken into a series rather than crammed into one two-hour block. There is a lot of material for Wright to cover here and, as a result, the entire film feels rushed. There's a lot of characters to introduce and a lot of fights to get through and, since it was all done in one film, it's forced to skimp out on interesting backstory and character development. Before each fight, Ramona gives us a quick blurb of history explaining her failed relationship with each ex. It gets the job done but I can only imagine how much more we could've been given if Wright were given the opportunity to spread the seven-issues worth of material over three movies instead of one. The movie zips along from one fight to the next, oftentimes with little time to breath or watch the Scott/Ramona relationship develop.You can tell everyone had a blast on this film and Wright has used some of the best young talent. Michael Cera doesn't really stretch himself as the titular Scott Pilgrim, but his meek personality is perfect for the character; Mary Elizabeth Winstead is beautiful as Ramona and she makes the perfect dream woman. My favorite performances weren't the key cast and instead came from some of the supporting players. Kieran Culkin was freakin' hilarious as Scott's gay roommate Wallace Wells and responsible for some of the best line deliveries. The exes, being the centerpiece of the film, were some inspired choices including Chris Evans, Brandon Routh, and Jason Schwartzman. There's even a great cameo from Thomas Jane and Clifton Collins Jr that I'm not going to spoil here, but it's the funniest part of the entire movie. It's really a shame this movie didn't perform well at the box office, but I guess it's aimed at a niche audience (comic and gamer geeks). In a sense, it's actually good Wright crammed all the material into one movie seeing as how the weak performance might not have warranted further movies to complete the saga.",8,2,7,17 February 2011
The Usual Suspects," Bryan Singer's First Big Hit
","I guess you don't get the same effect when you first watch a movie like THE USUAL SUSPECTS more than fifteen years after it was first released. Any chance of being 'surprised' at the ending is ruined because spoilers have long since become common knowledge. I knew who Keyser Söze was way before I ever bothered to hunt down the movie. Of course, if you're reading this there's a possibility you haven't seen the film and, on the off chance you've somehow managed to avoid exposure to the oft-spoiled ending, I won't mention it here. I'm just here to explain if I enjoyed it, which I did for the most part. The movie is your conventional crime drama with a strong cast and some sharp writing that prevent it from fading into obscurity. It begins in the aftermath of a boat explosion where three career criminals were killed and evidence of a rumored multimillion dollar drug deal is no where to be found. What brought these criminals together and what went wrong on that boat? Only one man might hold the answers: Verbal Kint, a smalltime criminal with cerebral palsy and one of only two survivors from the botched operation. In an interrogation with Agent Kujan of US Customs, Kint will explain how it all came together: how five con-men with their own agendas were brought together with the help of a police lineup and eventually found themselves employed by the mysterious Keyser Söze. But the question remains, who is Keyser Söze?Having seen this movie so long after it originally hit, I've got to say: wow, it feels dated. When I was watching it, it consistently screamed 90's. The editing, the cinematography, just the overall style is firmly planted in the decade. In a sense, it kind of sucks. As much as I've heard and read about the movies over the years, I guess I expected something with a little more of it's own style. It doesn't detract overwhelmingly from the movie. It's still a solid story with a great cast of characters, but it's just visually unimpressive. It's a pretty basic premise for a movie and I think it was the 'twist' ending that grabbed a lot of people's attentions. Really, it's not so much a twist because it didn't really have that much of a bearing on the story. Looking back, the big revelation could've involved any character and it wouldn't really have been any different. It makes the ending memorable, sure, especially the means in which it was accomplished during the interrogation. That much was cool, no doubt. Christopher McQuarrie has since gone on to prove himself a capable enough screenwriter and his nonlinear storytelling keeps the movie intriguing (even when, in my case, you know how it ends beforehand). I suppose the best thing to come from this movie was director Bryan Singer's first major success. I can't imagine he would've been able to bring his vision of X-MEN to life if he hadn't knocked this one out of the park with audiences.Going in, I knew Kevin Spacey was in the film and, as anyone who's even seen Kevin Spacey in a film can attest, he's guaranteed to be awesome. And he was. He brings his best in every role he adopts, and Verbal Kint is no different. Kint is a strange man, seemingly small time compared to the situation he's found himself in but you can't help but feel there's more to his character. Speaking of characters, let's go back to how I mentioned the overwhelming 90's vibe and take a moment to bring up the cast. If this cast doesn't feel ripped right out of the decade, I don't know what does: Gabriel Byrne, Chazz Palminteri, comedian (with a penchant for dramatic roles) Kevin Pollack, Benicio Del Toro, and (I kid you not) Stephen Baldwin. To be fair, Del Toro has gone on to continuing success in his career and I love his character, Fenster. Del Toro has admitted that Fenster only serves the movie as a plot device about halfway through and took the opportunity to have a little fun with it, giving him near indecipherable speech that steals scenes from the heavyweight performances going on around him. These guys make for an interesting, if eclectic, bunch. Byrne is great as the movie's 'hero'. His character, Dean Keaton, is a formerly crooked cop who's gone straight but finds himself reeled back into the world of crime. Even Baldwin does well here. All of the elements are here for a fun crime drama and new viewers are sure to find something here to enjoy.",7,0,0,11 April 2012
Quantum of Solace," Great Action, Fails to Live Up to CASINO ROYALE
","I had high hopes for the twenty-second Bond film after seeing CASINO ROYALE. I loved that film and I easily rank it as my favorite Bond film so far. I wasn't disappointed in the latest installment but it definitely did not live up to my expectations. As the first official 007 sequel, the film picks up immediately after the last with Bond on the trail of the organization responsible for Vesper Lynd's death. He discovers a widespread, secret organization known as Quantum; one of it's members, Dominic Greene, is in the process of assisting with a military overthrow of the Bolivian government.A major complaint about this film is that it's nearly ALL action. Considering that the film opens in the middle of an intense car chase and rarely lets up through the length of the movie, yeah, I'd say that's a fair statement. The first time I saw this movie, I was still a bit confused at the end about the plot. The movie doesn't really slow down enough for much plot exposition between action sequences. It took an extra viewing just for me to fully grasp what all had happened. On the plus side, the action sequences are creative and generally awesome. Most of the budget seems to have been put towards shooting locations and action.Daniel Craig returns for his second run as 007 and I still feel he is one of the best to ever tackle the role. The writers of this film didn't give Bond as many one-liners or utilize as many of his mannerisms but Craig still came across as a fantastic Bond. Judi Dench received more screen time as M and has proved that she is a strong element in the 007 series that has been under-used in the past. Olga Kurylenko and Gemma Arterton join the ranks of beautiful Bond women. I enjoyed Arterton and wish she'd had a larger role though Kurylenko did a fine job alongside Craig. As for the villain, I thoroughly enjoyed Mathieu Amalric as Greene. He's a soft-spoken, mousy individual with some crazy eyes and I felt he was a nice break from the usual Bond villain archetype.The film is entertaining, it just doesn't feel like a Bond film. It's loaded with fantastic action and beautiful women but it lacks the 007 charm. The cast did a great job and the production value was there, so I feel the fault lies with lackluster writing. Although, to it's credit, the opening credits theme was one of the better ones we've had in a while. The song 'Another Way to Die', a duet with Jack White and Alicia Keys, had lodged itself in my head for a good while after seeing the film.",7,2,6,25 May 2009
Independence Day," ID4 Was the Highlight of My Summer in 1996; It's Lost Some of its Luster Now
","If you had asked me what I thought of INDEPENDENCE DAY when it was first released, I would've given it a solid 10 out of 10. I was twelve years old when it first came to theaters and I remember seeing it that opening weekend. It blew my mind. I immediately went out and started buying the action figures and the alien fighter, and I even bought the movie novelization. I still have one of the big alien figures with motion sensors that make it roar and open its head cavity to reveal the little alien dude inside. I found it at a Salvation Army for something like $10 a few years ago. Of course I bought it because I seriously loved this movie as a kid. Now? Well, I still have a soft spot for it but it doesn't hold my attention as well anymore. I've grown and seen countless movies since INDEPENDENCE DAY hit theaters. My tastes have expanded and there's very little room for Roland Emmerich's alien invasion, other than nostalgia. Pretty much everyone has seen this movie at one point or another and are at least vaguely familiar with it. Aliens arrive at Earth on July 2nd and their enormous saucers settle in over major population centers while humans around the world lose their minds. Eventually the aliens begin a devastating series of attacks and send the survivors scrambling for some means of defeating them. Their ultimate solution: Will Smith, Jeff Goldblum, and an Apple computer.There's no denying the sense of fun that comes with any of the big action sequences in the film. Watching the movie again after all these years, I love the dog-fighting scenes just as much now as I did then. And you know what? They still look great. I was recently made aware that most of these big action sequences were done with miniatures and motion-tracking, and that's really incredible. These dogfighting battles are chaotic with jets and alien fighters swarming and blasting each other out of the sky, and I never would've guessed it hadn't all been done with visual effects. There were some in there to give it that extra flair but a lot of those are miniatures. No wonder I can watch it now, 20 years after its initial release, and be just as engaged as I was the first time. And of course there's the massive destruction sequences for which the movie is famous. Everyone knows the shot of the alien beam weapon blasting down on the White House and exploding and, again, it was done with miniatures and it still looks amazing. From a technical and visual standpoint, INDEPENDENCE DAY is still marvelous. Watching it again now, it's no surprise that twelve-year-old me loved this movie so much. It's got great action, great FX, and some of the coolest creature designs I've seen in a movie. The aliens in INDEPENDENCE DAY are still one of the best designed science fiction creatures I've seen in film.My problem with INDEPENDENCE DAY is that any scene that doesn't directly involve the aliens or the big dogfights is sort of dull. There is a lot of boring extra material in the movie and, at over two hours long, it could've used a trim. If they had edited this movie down to a solid 110 minutes, I'd probably still love it. Did we really need the whole Randy Quaid subplot? For those who don't remember, Randy Quaid plays Randy Quaid as a drunken crop-duster who we follow as he packs up his stepchildren in an RV and evacuates as part of a huge caravan where he eventually crosses paths with Will Smith and gets a chance for redemption in the big final battle. Who cares? Cut it. It added nothing to the film. We can also cut down a bit on the Vivica A. Fox subplot where she rescues the injured First Lady from a crashed helicopter and collects survivors in a tow truck. Don't cut it (her reconnection with Will Smith in the third act is nice) but trim it down. We don't need to spend as much time with them. Keep the focus on the alien invasion and how the government is dealing with it. Smith, Goldblum, and Bill Pullman as the U.S. President are the film's heroes and we shouldn't be cutting away from them so often; all the real interesting stuff is happening with them. No one thinks back on INDEPENDENCE DAY and fondly remembers Randy Quaid arguing with his son or Vivica Fox having a fireside chat with the President's wife. We remember Will Smith being chased by an alien fighter through the Grand Canyon or the captured alien awakening mid-dissection to tentacle-choke Brent Spiner in a crazy horror scene.That about sums up my thoughts on INDEPENDENCE DAY. All the cool stuff you remember is still cool, and it's even more impressive that it still works twenty years later. Will Smith knocking an alien unconscious with a single punch and muttering 'Welcome to Earth' is still awesome. But there's a lot of filler tossed in there to give this movie a more epic scope that just doesn't interest me and it can make the film's bloated runtime difficult to get through. Even moreso if you're watching the extended cut with an additional fifteen minutes of footage. It tries to take itself a little too seriously for a movie with Judd Hirsch cracking wise in Area 51 but, even with its flaws, it's still a classic in its own right.",7,1,1,8 January 2017
Alien vs. Predator," A Bitter Disappointment for Franchise Fans
","I am a huge fan of both the 'Alien' and 'Predator' franchises. In fact, the original 'Alien' is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. While I have never read the comic books and I may have only glanced over the video games, I still recognized the potential if both of these epic science fiction baddies were put on screen together. Sadly, when that day finally arrived that these sci-fi/horror icons were pitted against each other, it was a mediocre disappointment. Why must Paul W. S. Anderson does this to us? A quick synopsis for those who haven't seen it: billionaire Charles Bishop Weyland (sound familiar?) hires a crew to assist him in investigating an ancient pyramid that one of his satellites detected in Antarctica. Upon arriving at the pyramid, 2000 feet beneath the ice, they are faced with the realization that they have wandered into a Predator proving grounds and now must escape as the two species duke it out.Honestly, the movie wasn't COMPLETE trash. Just the fact that we get to see Aliens fighting Predators for the first time ever on screen gives the movie some brownie points. I've been waiting for this match-up for a long time and I was super-pysched to see it come to fruition. The special effects in this movie deserve some credit as well. The Aliens looked fantastic, and the blend of practical effects and CGI is near seamless. The Predators have a beefed up new look that makes them seem more threatening than ever, and we are treated to the usual arsenal of high-tech/primitive weaponry (with a few improvements).Unfortunately, in this movie, the bad outweighs the good. My first (and largest) complaint is the same as you've probably read in a bunch of other comments and message boards: why PG-13?!?!? This movie is a combination of the two greatest RATED R sci-fi horror movie franchises. So they throw the two together, they sugar-coat it to a teen-friendly PG-13?! NO! This is supposed to be a violent showdown and because of this rating, we miss out on some aspects that made the original movies what they were. All of the major violence (against humans anyway) occurs off screen in this movie, whereas we were treated to every gory detail in 'Predator'. In 'AVP', you might see some blood spatter on a wall but nothing more. While on the topic of violence, my other major complaint with this movie is the editing style. During the Alien/Predator fight scenes, most of the shots are too close and the edits to quick to really see what's going on. In a film like this, I want WIDE angles so I can see the battle raging! This isn't MTV, this is WAR! Finally, we have the story and the cast. The story is pretty basic and weak, but it was enough to move things along. I felt it took a little too long to really get to the meat of things, but when it does, it takes off. The cast were really nothing special. Sanaa Lathan plays the heroine, Alexa Woods, and doesn't come close to matching the strength of Sigourney Weaver and her role as Ripley. Lance Henriksen plays the role of Charles Weyland and is the only real acting strength in the entire movie. The rest of the cast (all 10 of them) are forgettable and die off relatively fast so it doesn't matter. Overall, this movie is worth watching at least once if you are already a fan of the franchises or the genre.Now, let's just be glad Anderson will not be directing the sequel.",6,2,3,16 December 2007
District 9," Neill Blomkamp Amazes with First Major Film
","Director Neill Blomkamp's first major film proves that he is a filmmaker worthy of keeping your eye on in coming years. While the trailers intrigued me, I had no idea what to expect from his film until I finally sat down in the theater and was blown away. Part mockumentary, part drama, and part sci-fi/action film...Blomkamp's movie touches on a few different genres and is an exciting run. In the film, an alien spacecraft arrived over Johannesburg, South Africa twenty years ago and the malnourished, confused inhabitants were brought down to the surface to live in a cordoned-off section of the city. Over the years, anti-alien sentiment has risen to explosive levels and the film begins with the corporation responsible for overseeing the aliens beginning an eviction process to move them further from the city. The film follows the character of Wikus Van De Merwe, an agent of the corporation, who is exposed to alien technology and soon begins a horrible transformation that draws the attention of the company, as well as a group of Nigerian terrorists. Wikus is then forced to seek refuge amongst those he's spent his life oppressing.The film is said to draw many parallels to the apartheid situation from South Africa, but I'm unfamiliar with the history of the topic and therefore was able to watch the movie for what it was. The story covers elements we've seen before and Wikus's transformation is heavily reminiscent of Seth Brundle's in THE FLY (1986) but it's what Blomkamp does with the material that makes it so entertaining. The film begins in the style of a documentary, interviewing Wikus and those close to him (both family and co-workers) as well as experts and historians knowledgeable on the aliens' existence since arriving on Earth. All of this would've been more than sufficient to keep my interest but halfway through the film, it shifts into an action-packed summer popcorn film. It unloads a series of action sequences that keep the audience riveted until the closing credits. Despite the film's $30 million budget (low compared to most other summer blockbusters), the film is brilliantly done. The visual effects of the aliens and their weaponry are seamless and rarely, if ever, feel like CGI.Just as DISTRICT 9 is Blomkamp's breakout film, it is also star Sharlto Copley's first real acting gig. Considering a good portion of the dialogue was shot was improvisation, Copley does an incredible job. He's charismatic and likable in the beginning as the bumbling Wikus but rises up as a heroic character for the final act of the film and he does a great job throughout. The majority of the remaining cast were minor supporting characters and Copley was the primary driving performance in the film; for a first-time actor, he went above and beyond some of the even more experienced Hollywood stars today. There really isn't anything to dislike about this film and it should appeal to almost anyone.",9,1,3,18 January 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," An Improvement Over the First HOBBIT Film
","I was excited at the arrival of the first Hobbit film in 2012. I was a fan of Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings films and the idea of revisiting his cinematic interpretation of Middle Earth was amazing. The first film, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY, came and went and I found my interested failing. It wasn't a horrible film but it was painfully obvious that they had taken a single volume tale and stretched it beyond its limits to fill the time. But I hadn't given up completely. I returned to the theaters the following year for THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG. This time around, it seemed to go a lot smoother. The second film in the Hobbit trilogy is a much stronger, more entertaining film than the first while still falling short of the awe-inspiring Rings series. When we last left Thorin Oakenshield and his company of fellow dwarfs, they had narrowly avoided death at the hands of the vengeful orc Azog the Defiler following their escape from the goblins under the Misty Mountains. We rejoin them on their quest to reclaim Erebor, the Lonely Mountain, as they're approaching the outskirts of the forests of Mirkwood. Their adventure in THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG will bring them into contact with giant spiders, woodland elves, a skin-changer, and the world of men before finally culminating in their arrival at the shattered dwarven kingdom under the mountain. And there, Bilbo Baggins will need to uphold his end of the contact by sneaking into the mountain and snatching the legendary Arkenstone from under the guard of a sleeping dragon.My issue with the first film was the meandering pace of it all. It just sort of limped from one set piece to the next and, by the end of it all, we really hadn't accomplished much. The second film finally kicks into gear, introducing new characters that will actually serve a purpose in the climax of the series and not only bringing us to Erebor's doorstep but actually taking us inside. I haven't yet seen THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES but I can almost guarantee that this film will remain my favorite of the series. It contains more of the iconic scenes from the novel that I've been waiting to see since it was announced that Jackson would be adapting the story, namely the barrel escape (because I knew Jackson would jazz it up into a massive action sequencewhich he did) and Bilbo's introduction to the dragon, Smaug (which I knew Jackson would jazz up into a massive action sequence but hoped he wouldn'tand he did). As I expected, the movie's got the same boost of filler I'd come to expect from the last film but it all feels more natural and less forced. The action scenes are more exciting this time around and the sequences move along with a sense of purpose. The CG is still a problem and I would much rather have the traditional practical FX for the orcs but I'll just have to accept that we won't be getting them anymore.Being that this is THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG, the main event is obviously the dragon we've come all this way to see. My complaints of the excessive CG still hold up here, as I would've loved to see a blend of practical and CG in bringing the legendary creature to life, but overall I can't complain. He was animated well and the performance of Benedict Cumberbatch seals it for me. Smaug was well worth the wait. I was happy to find that he was given ample screen time but I wish it would've focused more on the conversation between he and Bilbo as it was in the book instead of devolving into an overlong chase sequence through the dwarven halls. And, as much time as it took to get to the big finale, I was admittedly a bit disappointed when Jackson couldn't be bothered to close it out by the end of the movie, instead dragging the conclusion to the start of the third and final film. That was one more tease than I needed. Regardless, all of my complaints aside, I actually really enjoyed the second Hobbit film and it reinvigorated my interest in the franchise. I've come to accept that this new trilogy is no LORD OF THE RINGS but it's enjoyable enough. THE DESOLATION OF SMAUG is a fun adventure ride and, surprisingly, it never really feels bloated at its length. It's a great segue film into what will assuredly be a CG visual madhouse of a finale in the last film.",8,0,3,6 July 2015
Batman Begins," Reinvention of Batman for a New Generation
","Eight years after Joel Schumacher officially turned the franchise into a joke with BATMAN & ROBIN, Christopher Nolan came along and rebuilt it from the ground up. He reinvented the series, starting from the very beginning and reintroducing the world to one of the most famous comic book icons. The movie is an origin tale, beginning with Bruce Wayne's globe-trotting and training with the League of Shadows and showing us his initial transformation from angst-ridden millionaire into Gotham City's only hope. In his first investigation into the business of local crime boss Carmine Falcone, Batman stumbles onto a plot overseen by a local criminal psychologist in which an ghost from Wayne's past has plans to destroy the citizens of Gotham.Nolan's intention with the film was to make it look and feel as if it could exist in the real world, and he succeeds. The Gotham City of Nolan's film is reminiscent of Chicago or New York City, with the overly exaggerated Gothic features of the Burton and Schumacher films no longer present. The villains aren't lunatics in colorful costumes and even Batman himself feels more grounded. Nolan goes through the effort to show Wayne putting his persona together from experimental gear from Wayne Enterprises rather than suddenly dropping Wayne into the Batsuit and expecting the audience to accept it. One of my favorite improvements over the previous films is the Tumbler (the new Batmobile, though you'll never heard it referred to as such). The car chase through (and over) Gotham with Batman in the Tumbler is easily one of the greatest action sequences in the film.Nolan has assembled an all-star cast for this film that blew my mind. Christian Bale has stepped up as the newest Bruce Wayne/Batman and I believe he's the best one yet. Bale has the charm and ability to portray inner-pain needed for Wayne and the physique and presence for his nocturnal alter-ego. Michael Caine is also a major improvement for the character of Alfred, Wayne's fatherly butler and only real friend. Caine infuses the role with sharp wit while at all times coming off as a form of caring parent. I absolutely loved Cillian Murphy as Dr. Jonathan Crane, head of Arkham Asylum with ties to organized crime. On top of all this, you still have great performances from Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Rutger Hauer, and of course...Liam Neeson. I'd never thought of Neeson for a villainous role before be he was fantastic (as expected). The only weak link in the entire cast was Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, assistant district attorney and Bruce's life-long friend. It wasn't that Holmes did terrible, she just failed to hold her own while surrounded by so much incredible talent and her weaker acting stood out.The film has a total run-time nearing 2.5 hours but Nolan spends that time wisely, giving us an in-depth glimpse into the life that turned Bruce Wayne into Batman. He covers the murder of his parents and lead straight up through the training and real-world experiences that show Wayne he needs to be more than a vigilante. For those who have been turned off at the camp or goofiness of most comic book adaptations in the past, just know that Nolan brings none of it to the table here. Existing fans of the hero will find that this is the best adaptation of the character to date.",9,0,0,22 March 2010
Bridesmaids," One of the Few Rom-Coms I Can Enjoy
","Of my entire DVD collection, there are only a handful of romantic comedies because, no offense to fans of the genre, most of them are total crap. Predictable, corny, and shallowI would rather suffer through a Uwe Boll marathon than watch the average romantic comedy. Leave it to producer Judd Apatow and rising star Kristen Wiig to actually make a romantic comedy worth watching. It's a chick flick that despite it's themes of female friendship/bonds, weddings, and relationships, is still funny enough for men to enjoy. Any doubts in my mind were erased when I saw this film in theaters and a scene was so disgusting that it caused a group of elderly women who didn't know what they were getting into to leave the theater muttering about how filthy the movie is (for the record, it was the infamous dress shopping/food poisoning scene). The movie follows the character of Annie (Wiig) as her life essentially falls apart around her. She hates her job, lives with a pair of obnoxious roommates, and the closest thing she has to a relationship is 'no strings attached' sex with a man who laughs at the thought of an actual relationship. She holds on well enough until her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces that she's gotten engaged. Of course, Annie is going to be her maid of honor but there appears to be some competition in the form of Lillian's new friend/wife of her fiancé's boss, Helen (Rose Byrne). Helen is wealthy, tasteful, and impeding on Annie's territory. As the wedding draws near, the two butt heads over everything from the dresses to the wedding shower, but there can be only onewait, wrong movie.Kristen Wiig deserved this movie. She's one of the best talents to come from SNL in recent years and she's provided some hilarious supporting performances movies like MACGRUBER and PAUL. This movie is her chance to be a leading woman and she knocks it out of the park. I love the awkwardness Wiig infuses into her characters; her character feels really genuine in this movie. She's struggling to get by and luck just isn't on her side. She means well as she tries to help Lillian plan her wedding but her plans just turn into disaster, and Helen is there to take advantage of every misstep. I feel like I've seen Rose Byrne has been everywhere lately; I know I've got at least 2-3 other films she's been in this year. No complaints though, because she's great. She's proved her comedic chops in GET HIM TO THE Greek and she continues her excellent work here. She's snotty, overbearing, and self-centered without coming off as a caricature. And then there's the A+ supporting cast giving their best here: former SNL alum Maya Rudolph, Wendi McLendon-Covey, and Ellie Kemper. Melissa McCarthy stands out as probably the funniest bridesmaid in the crew. She's been compared a lot lately to being the Zach Galifianakis of the BRIDESMAIDS team and it's pretty accurate. She's the schlubby, socially inept goofball of the group and steals most scenes. Finally, there's Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm as Annie's love interests and opposite ends of a spectrum, both providing some great laughs (especially Hamm).Earning almost $300 million worldwide, BRIDESMAIDS was a blatant success and proves that romantic comedies don't have to be mass-produced from the same mold. I'm hoping the cash this movie banked will convince filmmakers to put some creative energy into future rom-coms instead of flooding the market with cheap garbage. I'm glad to see Kristen Wiig getting so much attention from this film and I hope that means she'll be getting more leading roles in the future. This movie is hilarious and has a lot of feeling behind it. If there is a comedy where men and woman can come together and both enjoy it, it's this one.",9,0,3,2 November 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The First HOBBIT Film is...Alright, I Guess...
","Ugh, there is just so much about Peter Jackson's return to Middle Earth that I wish had gone better. My expectations were high for the first HOBBIT movie, but I did my best to keep them in check. The original LORD OF THE RINGS films were just fantastic and rank high amongst my all-time favorite film series. I knew the new film would have a hard time living up to the quality of the originals, but I'd assumed it would come close. I mean, it is Peter Jacksonthe original man who brought Middle Earth to the big screen more than successfully three times already. I was mostly right, but THE HOBBIT: AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY has some problems that just can't see past. For those unfamiliar with the J.R.R. Tolkien novel, it follows the adventure of Bilbo Baggins (now Martin Freeman) as he finds his life turned upside down at the arrival of Gandalf (Ian McKellen, returning) to his home in Bag End. Gandalf requests that the hobbit join him on quest across distant lands with a band of dwarfs to reclaim their home in the Lonely Mountain. The band of thirteen dwarfs, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), were long ago driven from their mighty kingdom by the dragon Smaug. The time has arrived when Thorin will lead his band, with the aid of Gandalf, back to the mountain to reclaim their land and riches. Bilbo has been elected as their burglar, as a dragon-infested mountain might require a bit of stealth. But Bilbo might be in over his head...I'll start by admitting that I did enjoy AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY. Mostly. It doesn't quite come near the level of its predecessors but all of the ingredients are there. This is obviously a Peter Jackson film, as the scope is immense. The New Zealand landscapes remain a perfect stand-in for the various aspects of Middle Earth, and each scene is just as gorgeous as you'd expect from a movie in this series. I'm not surprised the movie was nominated for as many production design, costuming, and art design awards as it was. This is one element of the series that hasn't diminished, as AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is gorgeous. I was also immensely happy with the casting of the film. We have a handful of returning cast who fall right back into their roles as if they'd never left: McKellen (Gandalf), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Hugo Weaving (Elrond), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel), and of course Andy Serkis (Gollum) with brief cameos from Ian Holm and Elijah Wood to set up the context of the tale. From there we have a series of new arrivals, primarily our band of dwarfs. Richard Armitage is strong as Thorin but lacks any of the humility Viggo Mortensen brought to the character of Aragorn in the original trilogy. Thorin is stern and callous throughout the film, scarcely cracking a good-natured smile the entire time. I get that he's supposed to be our angst- riddled hero, but grumbling and snarling (especially as often as he does Bilbo, the most personable of the crew) doesn't open him to much sympathy from us. Of the remaining dozen dwarfs, less than a handful are given a chance to develop any personality. Those that do are a cool bunch though. Ken Stott (Balin), Graham McTavish (Dwalin), and especially James Nesbitt (Bofur) get some moments to shine and stand out, but the remaining eight or so dwarfs are practically interchangeable if it weren't for identifying physical traits (e.g. the obese Bombur or the hearing-impaired Óin). I'm hoping we get more from each of them in the next two films.My issue with the film is that it never should have been dragged out to three films. Tolkien's novel was only around 300 pages and Jackson is insane to try and create a new trilogy out of it. I hadn't read the novel when I first saw the movie in theaters and, even then, I could see the movie was loaded with filler. I read the novel afterwards and discovered just how much of the movie was extra material put in to fill out the nearly 2.5 running time. A 300 page novel spread out over what will undoubtedly be three 2.5 hour moviesthat is just crazy. And if a fan uninitiated to the novel (me) could tell that the movie was padded, then you know it wasn't done well enough. I believe the whole movie could've done without the Azog the Defiler subplot. I can see why it was done (to give the movie an antagonist in the absence of Smaug, who won't even make a full appearance until the second film) but it felt shoe-horned in. Azog the Defiler is a pale orc with a vendetta against Thorin's lineage with no given reason. He just doesn't care for them and he's made it his mission to rid the land of them. So he hunts Thorin over the course of the movie and pads the run-time. I might have accepted it easier if the CG effects used for Azog weren't so bad. Ten years ago, Azog would've been done with practical makeup effects and he would've looked good. Now he's a cartoon.Speaking of cartoons, I was also put-off by the goofiness of both Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) and the Goblin King. I know the HOBBIT movies are technically based off a children's novel, but the violence and darker content of the movie don't exactly feel like one. But then you have a goofball like Radagast riding a rabbit sled and making stupid faces, or the Goblin King (another CG abomination) and his grand-standing. You can take the HOBBIT one of two ways: a light-hearted children-friendly adventure or a serious epic. I would've been happy with either, but this bizarre blend just doesn't gel with me. In the end, AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY is mostly fun but it's definitely no LORD OF THE RINGS.",8,0,2,13 July 2013
The Princess Bride," I've Finally Seen This 80's Classic...
","THE PRINCESS BRIDE is one of those movies that is almost pointless to comment on because pretty much everyone has seen it, and everyone has their opinion. And yet here I am. I'd managed to go a long time without ever actually having seen the film, though I was familiar with some of it's more popular moments from their repetition and spoofing in pop culture. I also read the script as part of an assignment in college for a creative writing course but, at the time, didn't find anything particularly special about it. It just read like any other fairy tale film with some moments of appreciable comedy scattered throughout. When a friend of mine found out I hadn't seen the movie and gave me a confounded stare, I figured it was time. So finally, last year at the age of 31, I sat down to watch THE PRINCESS BRIDE andit was good. I enjoyed it. My daughter seemed to enjoy it. But neither of us had the reaction that most others seem to have in regards to Rob Reiner's 1987 fantasy/comedy. Since then, I've watched it a few more times and I'll admit it's grown on me more with each subsequent viewing. I've developed some respect for the film and I understand why it seems to have developed such a cult following. It sticks with you. I didn't think much of it when I first watched it, but now I can't go a day without mentally or verbally making reference to it.The story is your average fairy tale: young lovers are separated, the man is thought dead and the woman is forced into a marriage engagement with a corrupt prince. The price plans to use the woman in a plot to start a war with a neighboring kingdom, and the young man returns in disguise to rescue her. Et cetera, et cetera, and they live happily ever after. But the characters themselves are just so much fun. Reiner's casting in the film is absolutely perfect. Cary Elwes and Robin Wright are the epitome of fairy tale lovers: young and beautiful, with real chemistry. And Elwes is fantastically dashing as the swashbuckling hero. As good as the two of them are, I would've much preferred an entire movie about the trio of mercenaries who kidnap Buttercup (Wright) on orders from the prince and jumpstart the plot. Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), Fezzik (André the Giant), and Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin) drive the first half of the film as the mysterious 'Man in Black' pursues them to retrieve our damsel in distress. I loved these guys and the first half of the movie was, in my opinion, where all the best material lies. Once it all shifts to our hero versus the corrupt Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), my interest wanes a bit. There's still some good material there but it loses a lot of the fun, fantastical parody elementsthe Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp with the R.O.U.Sthat kept me laughing along.Despite it's minor flaws, THE PRINCESS BRIDE is undeniably a classic. It's infinitely quotable. It hits all the right buttons for a good comedy or adventure or fantasy film. And it's populated with an incredible cast. I love the 80's reliance on practical effects, from a time before CG became popular and turned everything into high-tech cartoons. The R.O.U.S. would never have been as fun a sequence if it weren't puppetry and people in suits. As fantastic as Elwes was in the hero's role, Inigo Montoya is easily my (and certainly many other's) favorite character with Fezzik in a close second. André the Giant made for the perfect simple giant with a heart of gold. His speech can be hard to understand at times, but subtitles made sure I wouldn't miss out on some of his classic lines. Chances are anyone reading this comment have already seen this movie and aren't looking to be convinced whether to watch it or not, so I'm not here to promote the film. I'm just here to admit I was mistaken in blowing off this movie for so long and I can now be counted among the myriad of PRINCESS BRIDE fans. I don't know that I'm much of a die-hard fan but it's got my massive respect for what it is and what it's become. Without a doubt, I'm sure I'll find myself quoting the film and I'll be more apt to stop and watch it when I stumble across it on television.",8,1,2,16 January 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," One of the Most Fun Films of 2014
","I haven't seen many of Wes Anderson's films. I think I've seen DARJEELING LIMITED and most of LIFE AQUATIC. I don't remember much, as it's been a while since either, but the one element that remained with me was the incredibly unique style of the filmmaker. I've heard and read plenty about Wes Anderson's talents, seen the praise heaped on his work, but it wasn't until the release of THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL that I made a point to seek it out. The trailer was hilarious and the visuals were gorgeous, and a lot of people were claiming it to be one of Anderson's more accessible films so I figured I'd use it to see if he might be a director I want to check into further. Thanks to THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL, the answer is a resound yes. I loved this movie. It's framed as a story within a story within a story. We open with an introduction from an unnamed author (Tom Wilkinson) who penned the tale that's about to unfold based on the experiences of Zero Moustafa, the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel with whom he'd become acquainted during a visit in the late '60s. It tells of an adventure he'd become entangled in when first hired as a lobby boy at the hotel in the '30s under the tutelage of the hotel's most famous concierge, Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). Gustave had a reputation for forming intimate relationships with the elderly ladies who came to the hotel and, when one such beloved rich guest dies under mysterious circumstances, Gustave is willed a rather valuable painting in her passing. This draws the ire of the woman's selfish son, Dmitri (Adrien Brody), and sends Gustave on the run with his trusted lobby boy Zero when Dmitri accuses him of his mother's murder. Hilarious antics ensue.THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL had me grinning from the moment we're introduced to Gustave until the very end. I don't know if all of Anderson's other films are this much fun but, if they are, I'm sold. The humor is often subtle and it's so fast-paced that it's easy to miss a great line or delivery if you're still laughing from the last. I've seen it twice now and it was just as enjoyable on both viewings. Fiennes is fantastic as M. Gustave. Gustave is the epitome of class. He swore an oath as the concierge of the Grand Budapest and he lives it to it's fullest. He has an immense respect for the position and finds enormous delight in his daily routine, especially when he's getting cozy with some wealthy elderly woman. One would assume he does it for the very reason he finds himself in this mess: get the woman to love him and reap the benefits in the form of gifts. I never felt it was quite clear if does it out of greed or if he actually had a thing for these women. There were glimmers of both in him. One thing's certain, he's a man of loyalty. Aside from the unwavering faith to the Grand Budapest, he forms an almost immediate connection with Zero (Tony Revolori), his new lobby boy. Zero accompanies him to the viewing for the deceased Madame and finds himself caught up in the craziness immediately after. Gustave becomes a mentor to the boy, going so far as to give his blessing when Zero falls in love with a local baker's daughter, and promises Zero the fortune from the painting should anything happen to him.Enough about Fiennes fantastic performance; there's loads more I loved about this movie. The cast is loaded to the breaking point with talent and everyone delivers. The advertising prints for the film are half cast list, promoting the more than a dozen talents starring in the film. Jude Law, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton the list goes on with special mention to Willem Dafoe as Dmitri's hard-boiled, silent henchman. It's also nice to see Jeff Goldblum on screen again, even if it's just a minor role as the hotel's lawyer. The impressive cast is fine match for the film's even more engaging visual style. I don't remember much of Anderson's other films but I hope THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL is a nice indication of what I can expect to see. The film's colors pop vibrantly. The whole world of the Grand Budapest (in the 30s) is a pastel wonderland of pinks, purples, and reds. And I loved that the camera never stopped moving. Every frame has a frantic vibe, if not for the character's erratic natures then the constant camera movement. I really can't say enough how much I enjoyed this movie. The story was fun, the characters were quirky, the film looked beautiful, and it's got an amazing cast. I'm not sure how general audiences would respond to a film so strange but it's won me over as a potential fan of Wes Anderson.",9,2,4,27 September 2014
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," Best Horror Parody Since SHAUN OF THE DEAD
","Good things come to those who wait, and I've waited for this movie for long enough. I'd wanted to see this movie from the first time I stumbled across the synopsis and learned that Alan Tudyk would be playing one of the title characters. Instant win. I knew there was little chance that this movie would be anything but awesome, and I was proved right when it was released at long last on home video (since I wasn't lucky enough to live in one of the few cities blessed with it's limited release). It's a new spin on the classic horror movie cliché of the deranged hillbillies terrorizing innocent victims in the woods. In this case, Tucker and Dale are a couple of good ol' boys heading out to the West Virginia wilderness to renovate Tucker's new vacation home/cabin in the woods. A handful of college students have also decided to make use of the backwoods for a camping trip, where they mistake the pair of bumbling rednecks as psycho killers. The misunderstanding leads to a series of unfortunate events where the college kids begin accidentally dying off in gruesome fashion, only solidifying their fear in the harmless hillbillies. TUCKER AND DALE VS. EVIL is equal parts comedy and horror movie in a perfect balance of the two genres from director Eli Craig (who hasn't really got much else under his belt, directing-wise). This movie is guaranteed to achieve cult status once word gets around about how awesome this movie is.It's such a simple idea that I'm really surprised it hasn't been done before. It's just a simple 180º twist on the sort of horror we've seen in Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE or THE HILLS HAVE EYES. Tucker and Dale are a couple of simpletons played to perfection by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine. They really just want to enjoy a simple vacation of fishing and renovations when the posse of judgmental college kids led by Chad (with his own dark side) arrive and fudge it all up. Alan Tudyk is awesome in pretty much anything I've seen him in. I honestly can't think of a single instance where his character was a weak spot in any film or TV show. He's given the spotlight as one of the title characters for once, and he makes an excellent redneck. Tucker is the more levelheaded, headstrong leader of the duo who's not really interested in the new arrivals and wishes they'd just have kept to themselves. Dale (Labine) is the socially inept doofus who develops a crush on beautiful Allison after rescuing her from a near drowning and essentially setting off the chain of bloody events. He steps into the hero role as he gradually comes out shell to Allison and stands up against Chad and his crew. Katrina Bowden fulfills her basic obligations as the blossoming love interest Allison, a beautiful girl with a hot cheerleader vibe and a heart of gold who's willing to overlook Tucker and Dale's social status. Of the remaining college crew, the only standout is of course Jesse Moss as Chad. The kid is demented and reeks of cheese, but his campiness suits the tone of the movie so you can't complain.In my opinion, this is the best horror movie parody since Edgar Wright's SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It succeeds in all the aspects of a good comedy/horror movie that the SCARY MOVIE franchise (primarily any the sequels) fails at. The jokes in the movie are hilarious, thanks for Tudyk and Labine. And the kills in the movie can be just as gruesome as any mainstream horror film; I'd give examples but, as with any horror/slasher movie, I don't really want to spoil any potential kills. Everything in this movie works great with the exception of the third act. After the characters leave the main cabin in the woods location and arrive at the final conflict in a saw mill, it loses some steam. Maybe because it drops the horror parody vibe I'd been enjoying for the previous hour, but the whole end confrontation felt like a misstep. It doesn't exactly ruin the movie, it just didn't feel like it fit for me. As a whole, I really loved this movie and I expect it'll garner a pretty nice following on DVD/Blu-ray. The filmmakers have done an awesome job here and all I ask is that they enjoy the movie's success without tarnishing its awesomeness with an unnecessary sequel. I don't want to see more TUCKER AND DALE hijinks; their battle with evil was cool enough on it's own.",9,4,4,15 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The Best Mission in the Series
","It's strange. I'm never excited when I hear that there are plans to release a new movie in the Mission: Impossible franchise. As far as action franchises go, I've seen and enjoyed all of them, but I can never be bothered to muster any excitement as a new one makes its way to theaters. I guess there's just something wrong with me because they're only getting better. I was worried that GHOST PROTOCOL, released five years after the third movie and rumored to be a 'passing of the torch' from Tom Cruise to rising star Jeremy Renner, was just a cash grab to keep a profitable franchise alive as they transition away from the aging Cruise. I was so very wrong and realized this within minutes of sitting down to watch the movie. As the latest mission begins, Ethan Hunt is busted out of a Russian prison just in time to reteam with IMF on its latest assignment. Nuclear launch codes were stolen by an assassin during a routine mission and are believed to have fallen into the hands of an extremist known only as Cobalt. Cobalt is believed to be a former Swedish physicist that believes there will come a time when the human race will be devastated and ultimately strengthened by a catastrophic event. He intends to expedite the process through nuclear annihilation and, to keep IMF on his trail, he frames the organization in bombing the Russian Kremlin. Ghost Protocol is initiated and IMF is disbanded; it's up to Hunt and his team to stop Cobalt from following through with his plan while at the same time clearing IMF's name in the bombing.The M:I series is fast becoming a new 007 series; each movie is helmed by a new director with his own vision and Cruise's character of Ethan Hunt it beginning to be phased out in favor of Jeremy Renner as the new hero. I imagine, as the series progresses, we'll be treated to an infinite stream of IMF agents as actors come and go, and each movie will have it's own style with each director's new take on the series. If I'm right and that's the case, I support it 100%. I have not been disappointed yet and GHOST PROTOCOL proves that the series, and Tom Cruise, haven't lost any steam. The fourth film in the M:I series ramps up the action, set pieces, and stunts and manages to include enough character development to keep it from beginning a totally shallow action piece. Ethan Hunt and William Brandt (Renner) have there own story going on underneath the surface with a connection from the past that isn't totally revealed until the end of the movie, and Jane Carter (Paula Patton) is battling her own demons as she finds herself conflicted between her personal feelings and her duty to IMF when her lover is murdered in the opening mission. Hunt is merely the duty-bound hero and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg, returning) is the comic relief, but there is enough story present without over-developing them.Director Brad Bird, primarily known for his work in animated features, steps up to helm the fourth film of the series and proves he's down for the challenge by making the best M:I movie so far. As I mentioned, the action and stunts are amped up here with amazing sequences including Hunt scaling the side of the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa, and a killer chase through the middle of a sandstorm. The movie is a tad over two hours long but you never feel the length because it never slows down. From the opening mission in Budapest to the final credits roll, the pace never lets up for more than a moment and story bits are fed in gradually between action set pieces to keep you interested in the characters. Michael Nyqvist (from the Swedish Millennium series) is the new villain, Cobalt/Kurt Hendricks. He's a cold-calculating sociopath who never goes overboard, monologues, or hams it up. He's a man who truly believes that he is doing the world a favor by trying to jump start nuclear war. Despite my disinterest in the movie leading up to release, it became one of my favorite blockbusters of 2011. Cruise may be a lunatic in his private life but I can't hate him when he's back on screen as Ethan Hunt. While this may be the beginning of a transition between lead actors, Cruise is still very much in command here and I hope we get another mission or two out of him before Renner officially takes over.",9,1,3,24 July 2012
Foxcatcher," Carell and Tatum are Just Fantastic in FOXCATCHER
","FOXCATCHER is one of those powerful character-driven dramas that I couldn't turn away from. Each of the three main cast membersSteve Carell, Channing Tatum, and Mark Ruffaloare at the top of their game. I have zero interest in the sport of wrestling and I would normally steer clear of a movie with a subject that bores me as much, but there was so much positive buzz circulating about it that I opted to give in and watch. I'm really happy I did because Tatum and Carell give mesmerizing performances. FOXCATCHER is based (loosely, as I have found) on the true story of Olympic gold medalist Mark Schultz (Tatum) and millionaire John de Pont (Carell). Schultz won the gold medal for wrestling in the 1984 Olympic games and, as the movie begins, he lives a quiet life training with his brother, fellow Olympic gold medalist Dave (Ruffalo), for the next competition. He receives a call from representatives of John du Pont requesting a visit and Schultz, with little else going on, obliges. Du Pont is a wealthy man and member of the famous family behind DuPont Chemicals, and he's interested in sponsoring and coaching Schultz in preparation for the world championships and, eventually, the 1988 Olympics. Schultz agrees to his offer and moves to the estate at Foxcatcher Farm where he trains with the old man. What starts as a well-oiled symbiotic relationship between two wrestling/USA enthusiasts turns sour when Du Pont insists Dave join them at Foxcatcher and the bond between Mark and Du Pont crumbles.To call John du Pont an interesting man would not be doing it justice. At least in the film, he is a bizarre individual and Carell does it to perfection. Apparently, Carell spent hours studying video footage of the man and even the real Mark Schultz says his performance is almost indistinguishable from the real person. From the start, you can tell Du Pont is abnormal. Perhaps from his isolated, wealthy upbringing or perhaps from a lingering form of mental illness, Du Pont does not interact well with others. You can tell from his speech he views those in lower stations in life as below him. He's narcissistic. He views himself as a patriot, interested in building America's image on the international scale with his attempts at sponsoring an Olympian. But he shares one thing in common with Mark and that is a passion for wrestling. Shunned by his mother (Vanessa Redgrave) for his interested in a 'low' sport, Du Pont strains for her approval. There's an incredibly awkward moment in the film where Du Pont is lingering around the gym while Dave Schultz is training the Olympic team when Mrs. Du Pont is wheeled in. In an effort to showboat, Du Pont takes center stage and insists on a coaching moment where he feebly shows off a few of the most basic moves. When Mrs. Du Pont loses interest and wheels out, Du Pont drops the act and everyone goes about their business. It makes you cringe at how embarrassing it is for the man and his team, who play along.I'll try not to let my entire review focus on Carell/Du Pont but it's difficult because he's just such a bizarre character. He finds kinship with Mark and, for a while, both seem the better for it. Before moving to Foxcatcher, Mark lived a lonely existence in his barebones little apartment where he mulled away the hours between visits to the gym. The opportunity presented to him via Du Pont gives him a chance at getting back in the ring while also providing a warped sort of mentor. Tatum deserves as much credit as Carell because this is the best I've seen him. He's a load of fun in the Jump Street movies but this is probably my first time seeing him in a serious drama. Schultz doesn't do much in the way of dialogue but he's got an imposing physical presence. We're introduced to him in the beginning as he's speaking before a school class on his accomplishments and you can tell how out of place he feels. Muscle-bound, he walks with the gait of a large ape and his communication is generally limited to short sentences. This is a man who's focused his entire life on sculpting his body for one purpose. But Tatum injects a lot of character into what at first feels like a simple man. He seems to operate primarily on instinct and the most important part of his life is his brother Dave. He takes a shine to Du Pont early on but eventually sees through the man, altering their relationship in a way that eventually leads to tragedy.I won't go into detail about the ending here but those who know the story from the news know where it leads. I, for one, knew nothing of it. If there is one major flaw with FOXCATCHER, it's that the finale doesn't have much of a lead in. I had to do additional research on the side to get motivation for the act because the film left me with no clue. It seemed sudden and unmotivated, almost tagged on at the end because the movie was expected to close with it. Still, FOXCATCHER is an intriguing movie and I'm willing to accept its issues. Carell and Tatum are enough of a reason for those who are curious to find time for FOXCATCHER and I think they'll enjoy it.",8,3,4,28 October 2015
28 Days Later...," A Modern Take on the Classic Zombie Genre
","Zombie movies need something fresh to keep my attention and Danny Boyle has done just that. Instead of the stereotypical shambling undead, Boyle has put his own spin on the genre, avoiding complete cliché while still paying homage to the zombie masters that came before him. The film establishes itself 28 days following an outbreak in London of the rage virus, a mutated form of Ebola passed through blood and saliva in which afflicted become mindlessly violent. The infected are still living and fully mobile, but they appear to lose all higher brain functions and rely solely on aggressive instinct. So, the 'zombies' in Boyle's film retain some of the classic attributes (such as their brainless nature and the attacks on the uninfected) while integrating a modern scientific angle, playing on the current societal fears of disease and biological weapons.While the movie can be considered a zombie film, I would classify it more as a survival thriller. The focus isn't as much as surviving waves of infected, but follows a group of four as they make their way through a desolate English landscape, avoiding the infected as best as possible and dealing with an even greater danger when they encounter an isolated military outpost. The concept of humans being more dangerous than the infected isn't new, but Boyle does a great job here and it creates a tense final act to the film.Cillian Murphy was great as the main character, Jim, who we first discover as he awakes from a coma and finds the entire city eerily deserted (making for one of the coolest sequences in the film). He is soon joined by Selena (Naomie Harris), Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and Frank's daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). Gleeson always makes for a great film presence and Harris was a strong counter to Murphy's optimistic outlook. I found the greatest performance came from Christopher Eccleston as Major Henry West, the head of the military outpost. He comes off as charming and you want to trust him in his position of authority but you soon find he is as corrupt as those who follow his orders.Boyle's film is a zombie film without being a zombie film. The cast do a good job of creating complex characters and you always find yourself hoping they pull through. Boyle's film helped pave the way for the modern zombie cinema, in which the iconic masses aren't necessarily slow-shambling flesh-eaters, but frighteningly effective animals. 28 DAYS LATER is light on scares, but instead focuses on the suspense and tension around finding yourself in such an apocalyptic scenario and for that, I think it's great.",8,4,6,27 December 2009
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A Worthy Sequel to One of My Favorite Movies
","Steven Spielberg returns with a sequel to his 1993 blockbuster that I believe was under-rated by many people. I loved the film when I first saw it in theaters in 1997 and, while it didn't seem as impressive on second viewing, I still find it to be one of the best sequels I've seen. John Hammond (Richard Attenborough returns for this short cameo) has discovered that some of the dinosaurs originally intended for his park have been surviving on the secondary island, Isla Sorna. Isla Sorna housed the location of Site B, where most of the dinosaurs would be hatched before bringing them over to Isla Nublar and Jurassic Park. Hammond is determined to send a team, led by a more than reluctant Ian Malcolm, to the island to retrieve photographic documentation of the thriving dinosaurs in an effort to gain public support in preserving the location.Just as the first film, this one retains some primary similarities to Michael Crichton's novel but it also takes a lot of liberties. Unlike 'Jurassic Park', I read the book before seeing the film for 'The Lost World' and so I was more aware of what the film COULD have been. Of course, those doesn't mean I didn't love the movie. There were just a lot of great scenes that were cut from the original story to fit into Spielberg's view.Of the cast from the original, the only returning key player is Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm. Malcolm was my favorite character from the first film so it was awesome having him return as the lead. I loved the additions of Vince Vaughn, Pete Postlethwaite, and Peter Stormare to the cast (though Stormare's role was small). Goldblum's one of my favorite actors and teaming him with Vince Vaughn was great. In addition to another great cast, this film gives us more dinosaurs than the previous. The audience gets their first glimpses of stegosaurs and compsognathus. We also get not one but two tyrannosaurs in this film AND they get more screen time this time around.Personally, I don't understand why some people complain about this movie. It's just as fun as the first; I don't quite understand what people feel is missing. I doesn't contain the some sense of wonder as the first film because this time we're already seen the dinosaurs in action. I've heard some complaints about the climactic sequence in San Diego. Aside from the fact that it deviated so much from the book with this sequence, I thought it was awesome. It gave the audience a chance to look at the dinosaurs in a new light, a new environment. I stand by my 8/10 rating because I found this movie to be a worthwhile sequel to one of my favorite movies.",8,24,38,7 May 2008
It Follows," Eerie and Atmospheric...IT FOLLOWS is One to Watch
","It's always refreshing to find a horror movie that succeeds in freaking me out to some extent. David Robert Mitchell's IT FOLLOWS manages to do just that. Watching it the first time in total darkness and slightly less than sober, it had me jumping at shadows when it was over. It's just so perfectly atmospheric. It feels so retro and modern and the same time, and it comes with a John Carpenter vibe thanks to the eerie synth score from Disasterpeace. This has got to be a breakout hit for both writer/director Mitchell and his cast of unknowns. I've been trying to do my part in spreading the word on the film to friends, as I know it'll be easy for a small indie film like this to pass under the radar without getting the attention I feel it rightly deserves. IT FOLLOWS is essentially a film about a sexually-transmitted poltergeist. We're introduced to our heroine Jay (Maika Monroe) as she's preparing for a date with a guy she's feeling pretty good about, and the date goes well enough that the two of them close it out with a tryst in his car in an abandoned industrial parking lot (romantic, yeah?). Then it gets freaky. He knocks her out and ties her to a wheelchair, but it's for her own good. He needs her to listen to what he's about to explain: he has just passed It on to her. What 'it' is, he has no idea. But it was following him and now it's going to follow her. Then only way to get rid of it is to have sex with someone else and pass it along. It will follow you, no matter where you run. And never, ever let it catch up to youI went into IT FOLLOWS expecting a slasher film. A murderous specter that haunts you, following you until it gets close enough to murder you, and all you can do to survive is pass it down the line. The premise sounds ripe for some real cheese but nope. Mitchell presents IT FOLLOWS with full seriousness and it works so incredibly well. The death count is low in this movie because it isn't about the kills. It's about the constant nagging fear and paranoia of the victim. They're forced to constantly keep one eye over their shoulder and if you suspect someone in the crowd isn't what they appear, you run. The spirit/demon/ghost/whatever will attempt to disguise itself if it means getting close enough to its victim. And the best part? Mitchell never bothers explaining what 'It' is. I can't state how much I love that It is left a mystery. From start to finish, we waste no time speculating on what it is. We just ride along with Jay and her friends as they scramble to figure out how to save her; granted she could just pass it off but that's no guarantee. If 'It' manages to kill its next victim, it just reverts back to the previous. Then there's the whole 'willingly giving an unsuspecting victim a death sentence' thing that (understandably) bothers her.IT FOLLOWS feels as much a psychological thriller as it is a horror film. Like I said, it wasn't the slasher I was anticipating so we spend the majority of the movie with Jay, watching how she handles her bleak situation. She starts the film so bright-eyed and hopeful. She relaxes in the pool, playfully shooing away neighborhood kids peeping through the fence, and kids around with her sister and their friends. Her life appears incredibly simple and happy. Then it all changes and she is absolutely traumatized. She takes to locking herself away, barricading doors and trusting no one. Nowhere is safe. But her friends are there for her through the whole of it, even if her story sounds more than a little insane. IT FOLLOWS has obvious allusions to the inherent dangers in sex (particularly STDs) but I feel as if there could be even more layers that I haven't picked up on. This is a movie that almost demands multiple viewings, as you're bound to discover more each time. There's a recurring theme of water (what with constant use of pools and lakes) but I haven't figured out the significance behind it yet. It's one of those elements ripe for post-viewing discussion. IT FOLLOWS is tense, haunting, and it would stick with me long after it finished. I have few complaints about the film but the one major misstep that bothers me each time is the final act, when Jay and her friends devise a harebrained scheme to put an end to It. But it's a minor quibble that doesn't detract from my glowing praise for the film, and I really recommend anyone that's considering IT FOLLOWS should give it the time.",8,5,8,16 February 2016
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Better Than I Would've Originally Believed
","If someone had asked me in early 2011 what big summer movie I was least anticipated, it would've been RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. For a bunch of reasons, the biggest being that I've never been a fan of the originals. Sorry, fans, but it was just a series I never gravitated towards. I've seen bits and pieces of the original and next to nothing of the sequels. If it weren't for parodies (e.g. the episode of 'The Simpsons' featuring the musical), I probably wouldn't even be aware of the big reveal at the end. I just didn't care. Combine that with my growing agitation with the sequel/prequel/remake/reboot craze and a title at least three words too long, and it all adds up to a movie that I had no intention of seeing. The trailers were intriguing, no doubt, but it wasn't until the reviews began floating in with praise for the movie and Andy Serkis' motion capture awesomeness. So I gave it a chance and admit that I was wrong. Establishing the events that led to the ape domination, the movie is set in modern times where Dr. Will Rodman is using chimpanzees in his tests to cure Alzheimer's. When a lab incident leads to the eradication of his ape subjects, Will smuggles an infant to the safety of his home until he can find an alternative. The chimp, named Caesar, becomes a part of the family with Will and his Alzheimer's-afflicted father. As Caesar grows, so does his intelligence. When an altercation with a neighbor leads to Caesar's imprisonment in an ape preserve at the hands of cruel men, Caesar grows to detest his place in the world as an 'animal' and leads a revolt with his fellow apes.I suppose it's a good thing that the apes in this movie are infinitely more relatable than any of the humans. Andy Serkis is the king of motion capture characters and Caesar is the best he's done. It really says a lot for the man's talent that he can create such a vivid character utilizing body language and facial expressions. Caesar isn't a sentient creature of another world like Gollum or an instinct-driven beast like Kong; he's thinking, feeling creature and Serkis brings real life to his performance that (with some fantastic CG from Weta) feels real. Honestly, the entire motion capture crew deserve some credit for their work bringing these animals to life. I wish the same could be said for the human cast. James Franco is pretty flat here. I'll chalk it up to the possibility that he just wasn't used to playing against a CG character. Freida Pinto is Will's love interest, a vet tech named Caroline. Her only real purpose is to provide the voice of reason against Will's mad scientist ways. John Lithgow stands out as Will's ill father and David Oyelowo makes for a pretty good villain (if business-centric = villain, here). The film also features the awesome Brian Cox as the owner of the problematic ape sanctuary, but it's former evil wizard-in-training Tom Felton who acts as real source of evil and gets away with a few franchise-favorite quotes (even if he came off as a cartoon character).The movie has sort of a slow build-up to the eventual ape uprising but, when it hits, it's pretty wicked. A massive final battle on the Golden Gate Bridge is the highlight of the movie, but everything leading into it is very deliberately paced. I guess I was kind of expecting more bang in the finale but the filmmakers must be saving the rest of the ape's rise to power for future installments. This movie was a lot better than I was willing to believe. It may not be the best film in 2011 but I'm sure it'll fall in to my top ten favorites of the year. It was enough to inspire my interest in a franchise I'd long-since written off, and I'm actually interested to see everything come together. The movie was a definite financial success so I'm sure we'll be seeing more and, next time, I probably won't wait for the home video release to check it out. Just think, if the CG apes were the best part of this movie, a movie with even less human involvement could be even better. Maybe and just do the audience a favor and shorten the titles a bit?",8,1,2,29 January 2012
Legend," Worth a Watch for Hardy's Dual Performances Alone
","Right on the heels of having watched BLACK MASS, here came another movie based on gangsters past with LEGEND. Whereas I had a rough start with BLACK MASS and found myself enjoying it a bit more on a refresh viewing, I wasn't as keen on LEGEND even after I gave it some time to settle in my head and went back for a second round. The pieces are in place for an awesome period gangster film but I really think writer/director Brian Helgeland made a mistake when he chose to focus a significant part of the movie on the relationship subplot. If we could've spent more time with our main characters and their illicit organization, I think it would've made for a stronger film. LEGEND is based on real life criminals Ron and Reggie Kray. The Kray brothers, identical twins, started as minor criminals on the streets of London and, by the time the swinging '60s were in full gear, had built a successful criminal empire and taken on a sort of partnership with the American Mafia in hopes of making London into the next Las Vegas. The movies focuses on the Krays' rise to power and the circumstances under which it eventually came crashing down, as well as devoting equal time to the relationship between Reggie and Frances Shea. Frances was the sister to one of the brothers' underlings and, according to the film, the two of them were in love until Reggie's business and loyalty to his mentally ill brother drove them apart.I'll start with the parts of LEGEND that worked for me. For starters, I'm instantly drawn into any period piece set in the '60s. The 1960s were a crazy time for everything from politics to pop culture so count me in. Combine that with setting of the London criminal underground and I'm sold. The production design on the movie is impressive. The clothing and cars of the period mixed with the elegance and style with which the brothers ran their operation make LEGEND a good-looking film. The brothers are portrayed by Tom Hardy in a dual role. This is probably the most impressive part of the movie. Hardy is already one of my top tier favorite actors and this gave him a chance to try something trickier than the average movie as he had to play against himself. Despite that he's playing identical twins, Hardy infuses each of them with bold, unique personalities that you're never confused as to which brother is on screen. Reggie is the slick one. He's the brains of the operation and handles most of the actual business affairs. He is thewellthe normal one. If it weren't for his brother, his character may very well have gone the straight route and abandoned his criminal life for Frances. Ron, on the other hand, is the fun one. I freaking loved Hardy's performance as Ron. Ron is certifiably insane. Our introduction to him comes when Reggie is helping Ron get out of court-appointed mental health care for a violent crime he'd committed. Ron is open about his homosexuality in a time when it was still a crime to be such in England but, seeing as how the man is a dangerous beast, he doesn't have to worry about fallout from it. Hardy gives Ron a sort of speech impediment where he always sounds as if he's speaking through clenched teeth, which only adds to the strange nature of the character. He's a simple man who would be perfectly happy giving up the brothers' illegal businesses in favor of going back to the old fashion ways of beating people out of protection money. It's fantastic and the best part of the movie.Seriously, just watch the scene where the Krays arrive at a pub to meet with the heads of a rival gang and find themselves instead faced with a crew of their enforcers ready to pummel them. It perfectly illustrates the differing personalities of the brothers and Ron's tantrum over his hopes for a shootout is just hilarious.But all is not well with LEGEND. As much as I enjoyed a lot of the individual parts of the film, the movie as a whole is pretty underwhelming and the majority of its problems arise, in my opinion, from the script. As I mentioned, the movie spends equal time focusing on the Krays' criminal dealings and on Reggie's relationship with Frances. I understand it was probably done this way to humanize Reggie a bit and give the audience someone a little more normal in the main role, but it didn't need it and it served as nothing but a distraction from the actual interesting things going on. I was so interested by the characters of the Krays after this movie that I went and did some reading on Wikipedia and discovered that the relationship between Reggie and Francis only actually lasted eight months. Based on how much time the movie invests in it, you'd think she'd been a big part of his life for years. It makes me feel all the more cheated. There's no need to shoehorn in a love subplot to spice up a gangster film that's got a rich history to pull from. Going back to BLACK MASS as a fine example, the filmmakers didn't feel the need to jam a relationship into the movie to humanize James Bulger. We got a little bit in the beginning and then it was all business. Mobsters, particularly the more successful ones, are interesting enough with their lives in the criminal underworld. I wanted more of that. LEGEND has some good stuff but it all feels disjointed with the interruptions and the ending feels so abrupt because I don't think we ever right the right momentum.In short, watch it for Hardy's performance and some great moments but overall it's a fairly forgettable film.",6,0,0,11 November 2016
Gone Girl," Scathing Commentary on Power of the News Media; an Excellent Thriller
","David Fincher is, in my opinion, one of the most talented directors in modern Hollywood. I'm almost certain the man could tackle any project and create gold; for the record, I forgive him for ALIEN 3that was ruined by the studio, not him. GONE GIRL is what happens when Fincher dips his toe in the genre of Lifetime movies. Not surprisingly, it's way better than it probably should be. I was raised in a predominantly female household so I am very familiar with Lifetime and its brand of 'entertainment', and I can't stand it. When I first read the premise of Fincher's GONE GIRL, I wasn't thrilled (it sounded sogeneric) but I was more than willing to give him a chance. He did not disappoint. GONE GIRL is the story of Nick (Ben Affleck) and Amy (Rosamund Pike) Dunne. We're guided through the beginning of their happy relationship and follow up through their marriage and eventual hardship during the economic recession. Things in the Dunne household seem shaky at best when the unthinkable occurs. Amy goes missing one morning, on the day of their fifth anniversary. There's evidence of a struggle and fears turn to those of kidnapping. The town rallies around Nick as the investigation becomes a national spectacle, but the media isn't being too friendly with Nick's, almost eerily calm, demeanor and secrets come to light that paint him in a horrible light. As the story unfolds in Fincher's creative fashion, we will learn: did Nick Dunne murder his wife?Even if the premise sounded depressingly generic, there was never a doubt that GONE GIRL would be a fantastically produced project. The cinematography, the music, the editingit's all got Fincher and crews' usual brand of excellence. The creative cutting and the structuring of the story into two very different halves is a fantastic bit of audience manipulation. We spend the first hour or so of the movie observing from one perspective as the investigation begins and the conservative fear-mongering news media (epitomized by Missi Pyle's Nancy Grace-esque Ellen Abbot) demonizes his every move. The evidence piles up and it becomes easier and easier to believe Nick might've killed his wife. Then the movie takes a drastic swing in the other direction. The truth about Amy's disappearance is way more twisted than Nick could've imagined. It all boils down the fact that Nick and Amy are one of the most messed up couples you'll ever meet. The flashbacks paint them in the usual light of your average struggling couple and GONE GIRL removes the sheen to reveal the insanity behind the scenes. The movie is an excellent piece of work and another success under Fincher's direction, even if it doesn't achieve the level of his greats (e.g. THE SOCIAL NETWORK, SE7EN, etc.). All of the elements come together to create a tense movie that grabs hold of you because you can't wait to see how it's all resolved in the end, and the pitch perfect casting makes it all the better.Ben Affleck gets a lot of hate and I never quite understood it. He's done some garbage but most in Hollywood have. He's also done a lot of great stuff, both behind and in front of the camera. He's excellent in GONE GIRL. He's already got a vibe that makes him come across as kind of arrogant and aloof; it plays into the character of Nick as one of his major flaws that contributes to the public's growing mistrust of him. I was somewhat familiar with Rosamund Pike, primarily from DIE ANOTHER DAY (I won't hold that against her) and her supporting role in Edgar Wright's THE WORLDS END. She is 100% awesome in GONE GIRL. Amy is an incredibly complex character (for reasons I won't spoil here) and Pike handles it flawlessly. She's sympathetic, intelligent, beautiful, and, when he true nature begins to surface, she's terrifying. As the key characters in this movie, Affleck and Pike and perfectly cast. The supporting cast is equally powerful with Kim Dickens and Carrie Coon standing out. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry both play against type to outstanding results; Harris as a skeevy, rich former flame of Amy's that hasn't quite let go of the past, and Perry as a hot-shot New York lawyer who's earned a reputation representing husbands with their head on the chopping block. GONE GIRL is a character-driven movie and the cast is at their best to keep the movie, at a whopping 2.5 hours, moving at a break-neck pace. Easy recommend as one of the better movies of 2014, and I can't wait to see Fincher's next.",8,2,5,11 September 2015
Django Unchained," Another Fantastic, Solid Film from Tarantino
","I am an absolute Quentin Tarantino fan. 100%. So my comments on his 2012 'Southern' film might come across as a tad biased. Personally, I don't believe my views on Tarantino are biased. If he were to come out with a movie that I felt was horrible, I'd have no problem saying it. I just don't believe he's ever put out a movie that was less than 'good' and I'd go so far as to declare DJANGO UNCHAINED one of his better movies. The movie has everything I've come to expect from one of his movies (great characters, brutal violence, sleek writing, etc.) and comes with the added bonus of being one of the few Westerns I can enjoy enough to watch over and over. The movie follows the tale of Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave in mid 19th century America who fate has separated from his beloved wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington). Resigned to a life of miserable servitude, Django's life changes for the better when he is approached and 'purchased' by the eccentric Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz). Schultz is a bounty hunter and needs Django's assistance in searching for a team of slavers and promises, in return, to aid Django in locating Broomhilda and reuniting the two of them. It might have been a simple mission if Broomhilda hadn't been purchased by the infamous Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), owner of the largest and most feared plantation in the South: Candieland. Schultz and Django form a plan to gain entrance to Candieland and escape with Broomhilda, but this is a Tarantino movie so it's never that simple.It's tough for me to pin down what was so awesome about DJANGO UNCHAINED. There's a lot to love here. It's easier to point out what doesn't work, but that's because my complaints about the movie are minimal. I suppose the only real complaint I have about the movie is that, once Schultz and Django decide to work together in finding Broomhilda and freeing her, the movie feels like it grinds to a halt for a few minutes so we can enjoy a very Western montage of Django and Schultz bounty hunting through the winter. By this point, Django has already upheld his end of the bargain (helping Schultz locate the Brittle bros.) and we're on the verge of introducing our main villain (Candie) but the movie says, 'Wait! Let's show them riding horses and shooting guns for a few more minutes.' Once you pass that hurdle, the movie ratchets up the pace again and continues on track for the rest of the film. I suppose this movie will get a lot of flack for the language, too. Tarantino's never been shy about dropping a few N-bombs in his movie but the context of this movie allows for some sort of world record on Tarantino's part. I'll admit, even as a white dude, it was uncomfortable at first when this movie started with the constant stream of racial slurs but this is a movie about slavery and, as unsettling as it might be, it sets a tone for the time period.Yeah, my problems are miniscule. That's because DJANGO UNCHAINED is pure awesomeness. Tarantino brings his trademark violence, eliminating any doubts that the movie might've toned it down within the first five minutes when Schultz 'negotiates' Django's purchase with the Speck brothers. Blood is shed in this moviein epic proportions. This might seriously be Tarantino's bloodiest film, if not on equal ground with KILL BILL – VOLUME I. No one does a modern revenge film like Tarantino and he makes sure every hit is brutal. We're also treated to plenty of Tarantino's wicked dialogue. After this film and INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS, I am a firm believer that Christoph Waltz was put on this Earth to act in Tarantino movies. No one, short of Samuel L. Jackson, has delivered Tarantino's sharp writing as perfectly as Waltz. His character, Schultz, steals the show just as much as Colonel Hans Landa did in 2009. It's no surprise to me that he one a second Oscar for his role here. He's so good, he almost eclipses anyone else in the film. And that's not to say the rest of the cast doesn't bring their A-game. Foxx is excellent as the title character. I've read in articles how the character was originally written with Will Smith in mind and I can't express how glad I am that he passed. This movie would not have been nearly the same with Smith in the lead role. Foxx is great, and so are the film's villains.The villains are almost always the coolest characters in Tarantino movies (e.g. Mr. Blonde, Ordell Robbie, Bill and his DeVAS, Stuntman Mike, andof courseLanda). When I heard Leonardo DiCaprio had been cast as an evil plantation owner in Tarantino's movie, I knew we were in for a killer performance. I'm not sure that he's the greatest actor, but I love how he's willing to throw himself at some bizarre roles and embrace the characters. He is probably the last person I would envision as Calvin Candie but Tarantino saw something in the choice and he wasn't wrong. Candie is a Southern dandy, obsessed with French culture and mandingo fighting and fancying himself as a Southern gentleman. He's a firm believer in Southern hospitality and a successful businessman in the business of slave fighting. His main house slave is Stephen, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Stephen is a conniving manipulator and way more dangerous that he appears at first glance. I'd say it was probably one of the more daring roles Jackson's taken.There is a lot more to love about this movie, but there's limited space to rave about it. It looks amazing (both cinematography and production design), it sounds amazing (with the typical Tarantino soundtrack), and the story grabs you and doesn't let go. Long story short: another win for Tarantino.",9,0,3,3 August 2013
Drive," A Powerful Character Piece with Great Cast
","DRIVE is another one of those low-key movies that didn't really get a lot of attention over the course of its release, and most people I mention it to haven't heard of it. The one person I've found so far that has even seen the movie couldn't stand it. The movie suffers from a narrow-minded audience that believe it to be another mindless car chase/action film, and DRIVE is the exact opposite of such a movie. It's a slow-boiling, tense drama that relies more on mood than bullets. With an awesome 80's vibe, the movie may not be the best from 2011 but it's high on my personal list of favorites from the year. Ryan Gosling is the unnamed driver in the film; he works in an auto repair shop and does the occasional stunt for Hollywood, but his night life involves working as a wheelman-for-hire to the local criminal scene. He becomes involved with his beautiful neighbor Irene and her son Benicio for a time, and the situation becomes complicated when Benicio's father Standard returns from serving a prison sentence. Standard is in a bind, and he owe's people protection money from his time inside. He's pressured to pull one final robbery of a pawnshop, and the driver agrees to help him in hopes of keeping Standard's family safe. The robbery goes wrong, the driver is set up, and now he's got local mob boss Bernie Rose and his Italian gangster-wannabe brother Nino to contend with if he wants save Irene and Benicio.I remember reading a bit of press when DRIVE was in its limited release when a woman was attempt to sue the producers of this movie. She was upset because she thought a movie called DRIVE was going to be the mindless action fun of the FAST & FURIOUS series. She was wrong, obviously. And she was an idiot. I urge anyone to at least know what a movie is before you pay to watch it, especially with the current exorbitant cost of a theater ticket. DRIVE never promised to be an action film; so if that's the sort of movie you're in the market for, keep searching because this movie will probably only bore you. It is incredibly slow-paced in the first half of the movie as it establishes the characters and creates the relationship between the driver and Irene. It is very much a character-driven movie. The car action in the movie, what little there is, does not compare to your average car chase film. In fact, when we are first introduced to the driver, we see him in action as a wheelman for an after-hours warehouse robbery. His escape involves almost no flair, no high speeds, no police cars ramping off parked cars and exploding. The driver is meticulous, keeping a low profile and hiding in shadows, avoiding conflict with the police at all costs. The driver in this film isn't your average over-confident, rubber-burning, catchphrase-spouting hero. He's an introvert, incredibly quiet, and incredibly talented behind the wheel.The movie may crawl for the first half, but the second half can be brutal. When the conflict with Bernie and Nino escalates and the driver is drawn in against his will, violence erupts and comes off as incredibly shocking after we've been so gently eased into the story for the first 45 minutes. It makes the little bit of violence that does occur in the movie hit harder when you aren't expecting it. There is a gritty realism here and I really dig it. The cast is superb. Major points go to Ryan Gosling, who is perfect as the driver. He's got a subdued, charming quality but it isn't hard to believe what he can be capable of when he's cornered. I loved Albert Brooks in this movie as Bernie Rose. I've come to a point where I hate the idea of the stereotypical hardcore, mafiaso-style gangster; they're everywhere in these sorts of movies and so many people play the character the same way. But Brooks doesn't. He's got more of a subtle evil to him, and (despite the fact that it's Albert Brooks) you have no probably believing that this is a guy you don't want to cross. Ron Perlman, on the other hand, sort of got on my nerves. He was a little too over-the-top as Nino. But, still, between Gosling, Brooks, and some great performances from Bryan Cranston and Carey Mulligan, this movie is filled with strong people that are giving this character piece everything they've got and it works well.",9,1,4,16 March 2012
Insidious," An Excellent, Eerie Ghost Tale
","I'm always impressed when a studio manages to create an entertaining horror/thriller film with a PG-13 rating. The lower rating means the film won't be relying on gore effects to rattle the audience, instead relying on atmosphere, creepy music, and hauntings rather than eviscerations. It's odd to think this movie comes from James Wan, the director responsible for the original SAW (the film that jump-started the world's love for torture porn). The film focuses on the Lambert family; Josh (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) move into a new home with their three children and mysterious occurrences begin almost immediately. Exploring the attic, their son Dalton falls from a ladder and, while he appears fine at first, he soon falls into an inexplicable coma. As her son lies comatose, Renai begins to experience instances of garbled voices over the baby monitor and visions of people in the house. Despite her husband's skepticism, Renai is sure something supernatural is involved. She finds help in Elise Ranier (Lin Shaye), a medium assisted by two socially-inept paranormal investigators, who delivers some grave news to Josh and Renai: it's not the house that's haunted, it's their son.I love a good haunting film (especially the adaptation of Stephen King's 1408). Ghosts and poltergeists are much creepier than masked psychos, in my opinion. INSIDIOUS doesn't bring anything new to the genre and borrows a lot of the same clichés, but at least the filmmakers try to do it with their own style. There is the usual séance scene, but to up the creep-factor Elise wears an old gas mask and shares the experience by muttering into the headphones of her associate Specs, who transcribes the conversation and passes it on to the confused family. I've read a lot of posts and seen a lot of web reviews of people who seem pretty terrified of this movie. I'm sure their exaggerating a bit as there's nothing really to scream about, but the movie does a great job of keeping the chills consistent. In what was personally the eeriest sequence in the film, Renai is cleaning her new home listening to some music on an old record player. She steps out take out the trash and the record player crackles, switching to the warbling sound of 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips'. Then, through a window, we see a young boy dressed straight out of the '20s dancing a little jig. By the time Renai rushes back inside, everything's back to normal. Little weird bits like that keep you on edge throughout the film (you know, unless you've been desensitized to normal spooks).I loved how the film touched on astral projection. Rather than running the same route as POLTERGEIST and other ghost films, it touches on a supernatural element we never really see in movies. The ghosts populating the other world, the 'Further' as Elise calls it, were great. The cast does an awesome job here, everyone filling out the usual roles we find in these sorts of movies: the tormented wife, the skeptical husband, the strange medium, etc. I thought the paranormal investigators (played by Angus Sampson and screenwriter Leigh Whannell) were fun as the comic relief in the later parts of the film where things are starting to get serious. Overall, it's a really well-done ghost story with very little detracting from it. I did think it took a bit long to get into the story. It's a pretty slow build-up as the family is introduced before we get into the meat of it all. I was also sort of put off by the ending (though I'll avoid details here). It would've been fine if it had tied up all the loose ends, but leaving it open for a sequel means there's a chance for more films to milk a potential franchise when I'd much rather have a real good one-off thriller.",8,0,2,24 August 2011
The Theory of Everything," Emotional Award Bait w/ Amazing Performances from the Leads
","There was one major contender during award season that I couldn't quite figure out if I was interested in watching: THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING. I am a casual fan of Stephen Hawking and I've read both his 'Brief History of Time' and 'Universe in a Nutshell' (as a layman, of courseI've no formal education in the sciences). I am vastly interested in the workings of the universe, even if I can't totally wrap my mind around some of the concepts in their complexity. So, a movie about Stephen Hawking was guaranteed to get my attention. I don't know why I expected a focus on his contributions to the world of theoretical physics in a mainstream biopic (other than wishful thinking) but the movie was still an interesting vision into the man's battle with ALS/Lou Gehrig's disease. It begins near the end of his education at Cambridge where he is studying for his PhD, and it's around this time that he meets Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones) at a local party. The two fall in love (abnormally quick) and it's off to the disease when Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) is diagnosed with motor neuron disease and given two years to live. Once the initial shock has worn off, Hawking becomes determined to complete his education, continue his studies, and live a life with Jane. The two are married and the film gives us a glimpse into their lives as Hawking's motor function deteriorates and the struggle to maintain a sense of 'normal' becomes too much.THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING is unabashed Oscar bait. There is no question about that. Period piece. Noble subject/biopic. Intelligence. Love. Everything the award voters could want. Thankfully, it's a good bit of Oscar bait. Again, I'm a fan of Hawking so there are few subjects more interesting for me in a biography. Eddie Redmayne won a series of awards for his performance as Hawking and it was well deserved. I won't lie: in the beginning of the film, he reminds me so much of a young Austin Powers (think the flashbacks in GOLDMEMBER) that it's a little distracting but it's not long before he disappears into the character. And he becomes more and more convincing as the movie progresses. It's Hawking's battle with the disease where Redmayne shines, giving a pitch perfect performance. Good thing, too, because Hawking's ALS is the main driving force of the movie. He gradually loses motor function, bit by bit, until he's eventually confined to the wheelchair and gifted the text-to-speech software we've come to associate with the man. The movie spends the majority of it's time on the relationship between Stephen and Jane and how the two of them manage to keep strong for the longest time until the stress becomes too much. I'm honestly surprised at how little recognition Jones has gotten for her part in the film. As incredible as Redmayne was, Jones was just as on point with her role as his faithful wife with her gradually fading optimism. Redmayne had the physical struggle; Jones had the emotional.Struggle. It's all about the struggle. As a result, this is actually a pretty depressing movie. Sure, it's got these themes of hope running throughout it but it's nearly drowned in the constant onslaught of sadness and hurdles. Almost every scene in the movie focuses on some new obstacle or the stress before moving on to the next. While it is an interesting movie, it's just such a downer. It is interesting to see the progression of the disease, and it's interesting to watch Hawking's career blossom. But, man, what a bummer. I guess it would've been difficult to form an engaging movie around the man's career alone, but I think I would've loved it more. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING drops little tidbits here and there, showing us moments where Hawking finds the inspiration for some of his ideas but that's about it. And the film follows his story up until the point that he publishes 'A Brief History of Time'. But then that's it. Oh well. The movie accomplishes what it sets out to do. It's a very emotional story and it's wonderful to look at. It's got all the ingredients to bring home the gold during awards season, and it's tailor-made to do just that. It'sI don't know.good. Go ahead and give it a watch. There's nothing here to offend any tastes and the performances are amazing but (for me, anyhow) it didn't take long to sink into the background noise of all the other award bait biopics out there, standing out only because the subject is an interest of mine.",8,0,2,15 October 2015
X-Men: The Last Stand," Mildly frustrating but still a good conclusion for the X-Men
","So, Bryan Singer ducked out of this one, which is a shame. He was doing so well with the franchise. Brett Ratner jumps in to pick up the slack this time around, concluding the X-Men trilogy. Though I have to admit, I hate to think of it as the end of the series. I'm hoping the studios decide to continue, or maybe switch gears and jump on with X-Force or X-Calibur. I don't plan on going in to too much detail but I will say that by the end of this movie, they had FUBAR'd their chances to continue the story of the existing X-Men team. When I first saw this movie on opening night, the story ticked me off. In my opinion, there are too many casualties/losses for me to feel that it had any sort of happy ending. But it's been done now, and I hope the series won't suffer for it.We get the usual awesome performances out of the main cast (Stewart, McKellan, Jackman, Janssen, etc.). Once again, we get to look forward to the introduction of more characters. Ben Foster impressed me with his minor role as Angel (a major change from the role he played in 'The Punisher'). The best part of this whole movie? The introduction of two of the coolest characters in the X-Men series (in my opinion, anyways): Beast & Juggernaut. I wish they had both had slightly larger roles, particularly Juggernaut. Kelsey Grammar was the perfect choice for Beast (think Fraiser, with blue fur). As for Juggernaut, Vinnie Jones does a great job with the little bit he is given.The only newly-introduced character I had a problem with was Kitty Pride. I didn't mind that she was brought into the story, but I didn't like her place in it. I thought the whole Iceman-Rogue-Kitty triangle was unnecessary; it didn't really add anything to the plot. Not to mention, it was just weird seeing Iceman flirting with her (the girl looks like she's 15!). I think the only reason I'm biased against Kitty in this movie is because one line...a single line of dialogue: her line at the end of the Juggernaut chase sequence at the end. Those who have seen the movie know which line. It makes her sound even younger and more immature than she looks and it sounds completely out of place in this movie.I still ended up giving this movie a decent rating because, even with all of the little things that bothered me, it was still a good movie. The final stand-off between the X-Men and Magneto's Brotherhood makes for a great battle. It's definitely not as good as 'X2' but this movie still manages to do its job and entertain. It makes for a satisfying end, but leaves you with hope (especially after the credits) that there may yet be more to come...",8,0,2,29 September 2007
Room," ROOM is an Emotional Juggernaut; One of 2015's Top Films
","Lenny Abrahamson directed one of the best hidden gems of 2014 in FRANK, a strange little film starring Domhnall Gleeson and Michael Fassbender about an indie band getting an unpleasant taste of mainstream success. It was a dark comedy with some real emotion sown into it. A year later, Abrahamson returns with a new film where he goes straight for the heart with a vengeance in ROOM. This man is one of the best directors I've found for emotional impact, keeping in mind I've seeing nothing else of his work but the two mentioned. But there is no denying the emotional gut punch you get watching ROOM. Based on a source novel from author Emma Donoghue (who also penned the script), it's a disturbing (and eventually uplifting) tale told primarily from the perspective of little Jack (Jacob Tremblay). As the movie begins, Jack is awakening for his fifth birthday in Room, the only world he knows. He was born in Room lived in it all his life with his mom (Brie Larson). He's a relatively happy child who believes Room to encompass the entirety of the world. Except, now that he's five, his mom believes it's time for him to know the truth. Seven years prior, she had been tricked and abducted by the man he knows only as Old Nick, the mysterious visitor who comes at night while Jack's asleep to bring food and supplies. Old Nick locked Jack's mom in the little 11' x 11' garden shed and she's been trapped there ever since. Now that Jack is getting older, his mom wants him to help them escape to freedom.ROOM is divided into two distinct halves: inside Room and outside Room. The first half of the movie is arguably the best material in my opinion. It paints a picture of daily life for Jack and his mom, giving the audience a glimpse into their meager existence. Ma tries to make the best of a bad situation for Jack but there's only so much she can do. Until now, Jack has had zero knowledge of a world beyond the walls. He believes TV shows are from other planets, believes common things like trees and dogs are make-believe, and addresses every item in Room as if it were one of his best friends. While Ma has done her best to keep Jack somewhat normalized and happy, she isn't faring as well. She's been beaten, tortured, and raped. She's been trapped in this room for seven years with only a small skylight in the ceiling giving her a glimpse of the natural sky. There are days when the pressure just gets to be too much; Jack calls them her 'gone days' when she lies in bed, not moving or speaking a word. It's a nerve-wracking first half to a film and ramps up to the eventual escape planning. Again, the emotional gut punches keep coming as Ma realizes she will likely have to put her son in mortal danger if she ever hopes of getting him out of there with the chance of a normal life. Meanwhile, Jack is confused and scared out of his wits. His mom has turned his entire world upside down with talk of how there is an enormous world outside the four walls and how all those things he believed imaginary are real.The second half of the movie loses a little steam because we don't have the built-in tension that comes with a captive and her son living in a box with an unstable kidnapper, but it delves into life after Room. It shows how Ma and Jack begin to adjust to the real world. To Jack, of course, this is more than his mind can process at first. I mean, the kid has never seen a horizon before and now he's faced with new environments, new experiences, and new people. While Jack does have his own troubles acclimating to the new life, Ma seems to have it worse. She seems all right at the start, relieved to be free and happy to return to normality, but after seven years of that sort of tortuous existence, normal doesn't come easy. Her parents have since divorced and her own mother has an old friend as her new live-in boyfriend. Her father has moved away and returns to reconnect with his long-lost daughter, but he has trouble accepting Jack and hiswellorigins. Brie Larson does a phenomenal job with this material. Ma is a complex, deeply troubled character and Larson positively nails it with a very natural, genuine performance. She deserved every award she brought home for this role. Equal accolades belong to young Jacob Tremblay. In my experiences, the grand majority of child actors turn in stiff, unnatural performances but there are exceptions and Tremblay is top of the list. I believed every moment of his performance in ROOM and it's a real accomplishment for both him and director Abrahamson. ROOM is undoubtedly one of the best movies from 2015 (again, my opinion but I strongly believe so) and it comes with a strong recommendation from me. You'd have to be pretty dead inside for this movie to have not even the slightest emotional effect on you.",9,5,10,11 November 2016
Across the Universe," Amazing Tribute to an Iconic Band
","The Beatles were a cultural phenomenon whose influence and unrelenting presence has hardly been matched by any other artist since the band originally hit the scene in the early years of the '60s. At this rate, I'm surprised we haven't gotten a good biopic about the bands origins and their eventual parting (though NOWHERE BOY was a good glimpse into the formative years of John Lennon) but at least we've been given a well-done musical utilizing some of the Beatles most memorable music. For the curious, yes this is a full-blown musical. The filmmakers have even stated that there is probably little more than thirty minutes of actual dialogue and storytelling in the entire two-hour movie. The majority of the story in this film is woven from the Beatles songs and how they fit to portray the lives of a group of friends living in New York City in the '60s. The characters are an eclectic group of free-spirits caught up in the drama that raged across the country in that turbulent decade: the Civil Rights movement and its ensuing riots, the Vietnam War and the protests that flooded the streets against it, and the introduction of psychedelics and hippie counter-culture. And just to be sure that everyone is 100% aware that the movie is paying homage to the Beatles, the screenwriters saw fit to name just about every character after a Beatles' song: (Hey) Jude, Lucy (in the Sky with Diamonds), (Dear) Prudence, (Sexy) Sadie, etc. Because, you knowBeatles!I'm a Beatles fan and I never tire of their music, so this movie is an interesting experience for me. It's essentially a two-hour long greatest hits collection strung together into one giant music video with some semblance of a story woven inside. Director Julie Taymor and the screenwriters did a great job creating a story from the lyrics of the Beatles music. The majority of the movie is expressed in song and it comes together great. Many of the band's most popular songs are brought to life and used in wonderfully creative fashion. Some highlights include 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' as young Prudence pines over a fellow cheerleader, subtly introducing how her character feels out of place in her small town because of her unspoken homosexual feelings, 'I Want You (She's So Heavy)' when Max arrives for his appointment in the Vietnam war draft and patriotism comes alive to feed Max into it's war machine, and 'All You Need is Love' as the pitch-perfect ending with a nod to the Beatles' 1969 rooftop performance on the Apple Corps building. They've even found a way to work 'I am the Walrus' into the mix in what is easily my favorite part of the whole movie, as the friends experience their first psychedelic trip with Dr. Robert (another song reference), a man resembling Ken Kesey and complete with his own spiked punch, psychedelic school bus, and band of Merry Pranksters. For any of those uninitiated to the Beatles, this movie makes an excellent introduction.The movie is a great experience but I have to admit it's a bit of an endurance test at times. At little more than two hours, this movie feels overly long and could've used a few more cuts to bring it down to a shorter runtime. That's not to say that the movie wastes our time at any point, as every musical sequence is used with purpose. It's jut a lot to sit through and goes on long after I became impatient for some closure and the end credits. Its seemingly exhaustive runtime is probably my only complaint in a movie that pays great respect to the Beatles and their music. The movie is visually beautiful and every musical number is perfectly choreographed and blended with bits of special effects for an other-worldly effect to the music. The cast, primarily a bunch of then-unknowns, are perfect for their roles. They each perform their own songs and I felt they were amazing covers of the beloved songs. Jim Sturgess, Evan Rachel Wood, Joe Anderson, Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, and TV Carpio deserve a lot of credit for excellent vocal performances. Thrown into the mix are also a series of awesome cameos for particular performances including Bono (for 'I am the Walrus'), Joe Cocker (for 'Come Together'), and Eddie Izzard (for 'For the Benefit of Mr. Kite'). There is a lot for Beatles fans to love about this movie and I hope new generations discover this movie as a means of introduction to one of the most influential bands of our cultural history.",8,0,0,26 April 2012
I Am Legend," Fantastic Revamping of a Familiar Story...
","I had heard a lot of hype about this film before I was finally able to watch it. I didn't catch it in theatres; I had to wait and purchase it on DVD. I wouldn't say it lived up to all the talk I'd heard, but it was still an awesome movie. The film is based on the 1954 book by Richard Matheson; in the year 2012, the world's entire population has been driven to near extinct by the Krippin Virus. The majority of the remaining population have been turned into Darkseekers, mutated into primitive creatures with a weakness to UV light. Will Smith plays Robert Neville, the last survivor in New York City who lives alone with his dog and struggles to find a cure.Will Smith has been one of my favorite, most-respected actors in recent years and he does a great job in this role, considering the man is alone for the majority of the film. His only interactions occur with his dog or the mannequins he has placed around the city to give it some semblance of a civilization; I can think of few other actors that would've been able to give the same performance with so little. My favorite scenes in the movie all involve his conversations with the 'locals', particularly a scene with Fred.My only real complaint with the movie is the CGI. The Darkseekers were all done with CGI and probably some motion-capture. Unfortunately, most instances where you see the Darkseekers, it's very apparent that they're computer-generated. It's never obvious enough that it pulls the audience out of the movie experience but it does detract from the film a bit.Overall, the movie is a totally positive experience. If you get a chance, make sure to check out the alternate ending on the special edition DVD. I found that I actually prefer the 'controversial' alternate ending versus the theatrical ending. While the theatrical ending provides more closure, I almost felt it was pointless. Whereas the alternate ending provides the filmmakers for further exploration of the story in the future.",7,1,2,26 March 2008
22 Jump Street," A Worthy Sequel to the 1st Surprise Comedy Hit
","I'll keep this simple from the start: if you enjoyed 21 JUMP STREET (the 2012 movie, not the TV show it was based on), then there's a good chance you'll find enough to enjoy about 22 JUMP STREET to make a viewing worth your while. There isn't a whole lot different between the two movies. The meta-humor is refocused on the fact that this is a sequel and the 'bromance' has evolved to the next level but, otherwise, these movies are nearly the same beats. Some would find problems with this (because it's not the most creative way to handle a sequel) and normally I would agree but what can I say? I bought into it. I had fun. At the end of 21 JUMP STREET, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) promised the next case would send Jenko (Channing Tatum) and Schmidt (Jonah Hill) to college. After a failed undercover case to remind us that these two aren't ready for real-world criminal justice, the pair are dropped into college to engage in literally the same premise as the first film. The two of them resume of their previous identities as the McQuaid brothers and are enrolled in college to locate the dealers and find the suppliers of the campus' latest drug craze, WhyPhy. The question is: having never had the chance to experience college for themselves, can Jenko and Schmidt maintain their cover and solve the case without going too deep and losing themselves in a world of fraternities and parties?I'm finding it hard to comment on 22 JUMP STREET without just copying/pasting everything I thought about the first movie. It's one of the main gags scattered throughout the film (the concept of essentially doing the same thing all over again to placate the audience) but, whereas I thought the movie would deviate a bit from the normal formula, it instead follows right along with what it promised. A lot of the story beats are pretty much identical to Jenko and Schmidt's adventure in high school with a few updates. The partners find themselves at odds (again) and drawn to different cliques of school life (again). This time, it's a little easier to accept as Jenko blends into the jock crowd as a star football player and Schmidt finds acceptance in the liberal arts crowd. The bromance between the two reaches new levels as the movie brings them to the point where they contemplate whether they're right for each other. Should they 'break up'? Cue the drama. Still, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller are a talented duo and they know how to handle it, bringing out the inherent funny while Tatum and Hill's natural buddy chemistry makes it all work perfectly. There's no denying that these two are a perfect team and Tatum continues to display comedic chops he doesn't often get to utilize. As basic as the story is, it's these two that continue to make the Jump Street movies so much fun to watch. Two movies in, and I'm not tired of them yet.Whereas most of the movie recycles heavily from the first film, it doesn't forget to inject some new blood into the movie. Ice Cube's role as Captain Dickson, head of the Jump Street department, is expanded and I love it. Peter Stormare has a minor role as a black market dealer known as 'the Ghost' and doesn't get much to do but the behind- the-scenes footage shows how much fun he was having fun on set. The movie's breakout performance comes from Jillian Bell as Mercedes, the roommate to Schmidt's new 'girlfriend'. Bell has a talent for improv comedy that allows her to not only keep pace with Hill in their scenes together but even surpass him for most of them. She's great and I wouldn't mind seeing more of her. As good as Bell is, the movie is lacking a villain as fun as Rob Riggle from 21 JUMP STREET as Mr. Walters. The best part of this sequel is a scene where Jenko and Schmidt go to prison for a Hannibal Lector homage where they interview Mr. Walters (now missing his manhood and embracing his newwomanhood) for clues on where to find their culprit. Despite its flaws, 22 JUMP STREET is a worthwhile sequel to the original surprise comedy hit. It maintains the same level of fun, the gags are just as unrelenting, and most of the jokes land. I reiterate: if you enjoyed the first 21 JUMP STREET (as I did), then this movie is a no-brainer and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",8,0,2,7 July 2015
Kick-Ass," Is the Film Any Good? The Title Says It All.
","Everything you need to know about this movie is right there in the title. From start to finish, this movie is loaded with enough action and humor that I never got bored. It grabs your attention the moment the movie begins with a wanna-be superhero diving off a skyscraper with his makeshift flight suit, leading into the initial realization of our main character Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) that no one's ever tried to be a superhero. Inspired by his favorite comic heroes, Dave throws together his own costume and takes to the night streets to fight crime. It's not long before he finds himself in over his head, attracting the attention of both a father-daughter crime-fighting duo and the city's biggest drug kingpin.For those who haven't seen it yet, do not go in expecting your average comic book film. This film is brutal. It doesn't pull punches are there the violence isn't limited to the blood-less beatings you find in Spider-Man or Iron Man. KICK-ASS is loaded with bloody bullet hits, impalings, hacked limbs, and unapologetic gore. And the best part, most of it is dealt by a 10 year old girl. I know that part's made a good amount of people angry and has surely stopped plenty of people from even giving the movie a chance. Roger Ebert was so put off by the concept of a kid committing acts of graphic violence that he gave it the worst review possible. When you watch this film, you just need to have fun with it. From the moment I heard of this movie, I knew what to expect and I had a blast watching a kid slice-n-dice and drops F-bombs. Some might argue that it sets a bad example, but seriously...who in their right mind would let their kid watch this movie?Director Matthew Vaughn (who did the equally awesome LAYER CAKE) did an awesome job with this film, and he collected the best people for the job. Aaron Johnson is the high school geek with delusions of grandeur and is hilariously uncoordinated in his superhero efforts, enjoying the perks of fame despite getting his butt kicked regularly. He did a good job but he was often out-shined by his friends, played by Clark Duke and Evan Peters. The best part of the movie was Nicholas Cage and Chloe Moretz as Big Daddy and Hit Girl. I'm sure I'm the minority opinion but this was one of my favorite Nic Cage roles ever. As Damon Macready, his goofy demeanor reminds me of a father you'd see on a 50's sitcom but once he dons his costume as Big Daddy, he's a violent vigilante who dresses like Batman and sounds like Adam West. He is teamed with his daughter, Mindy, as Hit-Girl. Just like Cage, she's got dual personas...as Mindy she's freakin' adorable (it was funny watching her get super-excited about trading an extra bullet to the chest in her training for a trip to the bowling alley) but as Hit-Girl she's downright sadistic and growls like Dirty Harry.The villains in the film were great. Mark Strong and Christopher Mintz-Plasse are Frank D'Amico and his son Chris. Frank is the city's top crime boss and his son wants nothing more than to be a part of his business. Chris finds his way in when he convinces his father the best way to bring down Kick-Ass is to pose as another new superhero, Red Mist. Mintz-Plasse is at a disadvantage because I still see him as McLovin from SUPERBAD but I suppose it works for this character, contributing to his nerdy awkwardness as he tries to enter the world of crime.All right, I've written more than enough about how much fun this movie was and how great a job the cast did, but the whole movie can be summed up with it's title. It doesn't lie and anyone who's a fan of superhero films should give this film a watch. It takes a classic template and warps it into something brutally entertaining.",8,4,9,9 September 2010
Ghostbusters," A childhood favorite that sticks with me...
","'Ghost Busters' was released the summer of the year I was born and I was very young when I first saw it. I immediately fell in love with it. It was funny and, at the time, a little frightening (I remember the Terror Dogs scaring the crap out of me). It is probably one of the most fun films I've seen. The entire movie almost has a cartoon-ish feel to it.The movie is the brainchild of Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis and stars some of the greatest comic actors of the decade. Aside from starring Aykroyd and Ramis, the film also boasts Bill Murray and Rick Moranis. The group has the perfect chemistry for the team and play off each other beautifully. Sigourney Weaver plays Murray's love interest and the victim of an ancient Sumerian god's attempted resurrection.The special effects are definitely a bit dated. Looking back on the stop-motion animated Terror Dogs now doesn't seem to have the same frightening effects. This doesn't hurt the movie one bit. I still love seeing Slimer and the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man terrorizing New York City.This is definitely one movie that ages well and is just as fun to watch now as it was then. 'Ghost Busters' is a movie every child should grow up with.",8,0,0,7 January 2006
X-Men: Apocalypse," The Worst of Bryan Singer's X-MEN Movies
","X-MEN: APOCALYPSE is the worst film in the franchise since X-MEN: ORIGINS. I don't think any X-MEN movie will ever be as big a failure as ORIGINS, but believe me when I say I'd rather watch THE LAST STAND again before I ever revisit APOCALYPSE. That relative disappointment, while wreaking as much havoc with the source material as APOCALYPSE, was at least entertaining to sit through. I was so incredibly bored with this latest X- Men adventure that I could've fallen asleep in the theater. It's nearly two and a half hours long and I can count moments I actually enjoyed in this movie on one hand. My distaste for the movie is even more depressing because there has not been an X-Men comic storyline I've been more excited to see on the big screen than one featuring Apocalypse. This movie should've been a surefire success. It incorporates my favorite X-Men villain with promises then of seeing his Four Horsemen, and it has the chance to dramatically affect the future of the X-Men cinematic universe and perhaps take things in an exciting new direction. What we got instead was a lukewarm villain who never felt threatening in the least who's wasted in a dull globe-trotting 'adventure' where we spend half the movie waiting for Apocalypse to recruit his Horsemen before returning to Egypt for a big messy final battle where Magneto, as the most powerful member of Apocalypse's posse, unleashes a CG debris storm visually identical to countless other summer blockbusters.For an Apocalypse storyline to have been done any real justice, it would've needed to been released as a trilogy of films. The brief moment of excitement I experienced when it was revealed the 2016 movie would adapt Apocalypse for the big screen was short-lived when I realized they'd be cramming everything into a single movie. There was a lot of promise in introducing this major villain but it was squandered pretty painfully. As Fox often does, they've made modifications to characters to fit their movie universe but the basic premise of Apocalypse remains intact. Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) is the world's oldest mutant, dating back to ancient Egypt and beyond. He's a mutant of immense power who, as the movie opens, is having his essence transferred into a new host mutant which gives him a couple benefits: (1) a form of immortality and (2) access to his host mutant's abilities, adding them to Apocalypse's existing roster. He's betrayed in ancient times and left trapped under the rubble of a collapsed pyramid in stasis before he's uncovered in the early 1980's and reawakened. He takes a quick look around at the state of the world and despises that humans have risen to power over mutant-kind. Apocalypse, a firm believer in 'survival of the fittest', decides to remind the world who's in charge. He recruits his 'Four Horsemen', powerful mutants who serve as his lieutenants and protectors in his moments of weakness: in this case, he's collected Storm, Angel, Psylocke, and Magneto.Now just because the movie is boring and squanders an awesome opportunity doesn't mean it's a total bust. There are a few small moments I appreciated. There's a quip as the latest batch of X-kids are exiting a movie theater after having watched RETURN OF THE JEDI and someone (I think it was Jean Grey) cracks a joke about the third movie in trilogy is always the weakest. I'm sure they'd intended it as a dig at Brett Ratner's THE LAST STAND but, sorry Bryan Singer, it just as readily applies to APOCALYPSE and that's honestly how I read it. Around the same time, we get the Quicksilver sequence. I'm sure most people can agree that Quicksilver's slow-motion escape sequence in DAYS OF FUTURE PAST was the most memorable moment so the studios, also recognizing that, give us yet another in APOCALYPSE as Quicksilver arrives at the X-Mansion just in time to evacuate everyone in super speeds to the beat of Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)'. A rehash from a studio hoping to capitalize on the love for the original sequence? Sure, but it works. And finally, the only other moment in the entire film where I felt the briefest flash of hope for this surely never-ending film franchise was the very last minute in the movie when the new (old) team of X-Men are assembled in the Danger Room in costumes that more accurate to their comic counterparts than they've ever been before in these Fox movies.APOCALYPSE was a real bummer of an X-MEN movie but I'm not going to let it ruin any anticipation of future movies. The series is now, what? 9 movies in? And we've had only a couple that disappointed me and one that was a total misfire. My problems with APOCALYPSE aren't enough to override the fun I've had in this series in so many of the other films. X-MEN movies aren't going anywhere anytime soon and my frustration with APOCALYPSE will eventually fade, and all we can do is hope that Singer gives us a better film when he returns with his new vision of the Dark Phoenix arc.",5,2,3,12 September 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," A 2 1/2 Hour Commercial for the Next Spin-off Franchise
","THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 wins the title of the most aggravating movie from 2014. It's one of those movies I really, really want to like and sometimes, if I haven't watched it in a while, I can delude myself into believing it was better than I remember. But then I watch it again and it all comes rushing back to me; this movie is unforgivably lame. I wasn't a massive fan of the first AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, where Sony rebooted the series with director Marc Webb and Andrew Garfield stepping into the title role. It was entertaining enough not to discourage me from continued interest in the franchise but failed to recapture the awesome of Sam Raimi's first two films. Leading into the release of AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2, I was excited. Now that we'd gotten the origin story out of the way (again) we could dive into a meatier Spider-Man adventure without the repetitive exposition. Plus they'd scored Jamie Foxx as the main villain and it was apparent they would be bringing the Rhino (one of my favorite Spider-Man lower-level baddies) into the mix with (no joke) Paul Giamatti in the role. The level of excitement was high as May 2nd approached, and then the reviews began to trickle out. The movie was being torn to shreds, but it was all right. I didn't always agree with the critics and summer blockbusters are always polarizing, especially comic films. There was still a chance it could be a fun time. Then I watched it.There's just so much wrong here, I don't know where to begin. Well, for starters, if you want to get an audience excited to settle in for a nearly two and a half hour long comic film, start with an exciting action sequence featuring your hero. You know, Spider- Man. Not his father. The movie opens with an almost ten minute long action sequence with Peter Parker's father on a plane where the movie reopens a plot thread from the first movie that I never got around to caring about: what happened to Peter Parker's parents. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is, amongst many other things, a continuation of this plot thread. Maybe if the movie focused solely on this thread, it would've kept my interest but the movie drops it immediately after this scene and doesn't return until sometime later in the second act when we've already stopped caring and want to see more of the Electro plot. Oh, rightthe Electro plot. We've got Jamie Foxx as our main(-ish) villain! How could this go wrong? Oh right, the writing. I'm not even sure how to best describe how underwritten Electro is in this film. His primary motivation for becoming a super-villain after acquiring his electricity-based superpowers (following an admittedly cool re-awakening scene in the morgue) is that Spider-Man is more popular than him. Prior to his accident, Max Dillon was a non-entity who went through life as a stepping stone in the path of others. A chance meeting with Spider- Man in the midst of a car chase in the beginning of the film spurs a psychopathic obsession with the web-crawler where Dillon is fully convinced that Spider-Man is his new best friend. Then he gains superpowers and decides he wants to kill Spider-Man because he couldn't remember Max's name. Oh, and he's more popular. Seriously, that's it. Electro's motivation in the movie is to kill Spider-Man because he's jealous.Oh, and Paul Giamatti as the Rhino? Man, they really pumped up his character in the trailers and TV ads. At least we've got Rhino, a character who's got to be fun because the concept of a man in Rhino armor is too crazy not to work. Well, Giamatti's role in the movie amounts to little more than a cameo. All that time spent pumping the Spider-Man/Rhino battle in the advertisements and we never actually get to see it. It's the opposite issue with the Green Goblin. First, I think it's a little too soon to be returning to the Harry Osborn/Green Goblin well. We got three movies worth of Harry Osborn in Raimi's series and Willem Dafoe was a fantastic Goblin in the first SPIDER- MAN. So I've already got a little bit of Goblin fatigue. Then we shoehorn Harry's reappearance into the new series with absolutely no foundation and we're expected to accept these two are life-long friends when we've never heard Peter so much as mention Harry before. Yes, people who are familiar with the franchise will know of their history and all that, but as a film it's just lazy to cram this new (supposedly deep- rooted) friendship in and expect people to buy into it. The problem is that the filmmakers were more interested in mimicking Marvel Studios' universe-building than putting out a good movie. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 isn't interested in telling a good story or entertaining youthey want to set themselves up for spinoffs and sequels and spinoffs of sequels. THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 is nearly two and a half hours long and it can be summed up in one scene. There's a moment near the end where Harry Osborn discusses establishing a team. A small team (hmmsix members, I'm guessing) to do, I don't know, bad guy things. A sinister team. Yes.SINSTER SIXcurrently scheduled for release in 2016.I wouldn't mind so much if the studio had crafted a fun, exciting movie to make us actually want a new spin-off. I'm not exaggerating when I saw that nothing of interest happens in the first hour of this movie. Nothing. You could jump into this movie at the 60 minute mark and you wouldn't have missed anything important. Jamie Foxx and Paul Giamatti were inspired casting, and the effects (especially the Electro effects) were actually pretty good. But THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2 never had a chance when the filmmaker/studio went in with the wrong priorities and lazy attitude.",5,1,6,24 January 2015
Ex Machina," Amazing Performances from Oscar Isaac and Alica Vikander
","There's been a lot of chatter about artificial intelligence over the past year, with public scientific figures coming forward to warn of us its dangers or praise its eventuality. Perfect timing for writer/director Alex Garland's EX MACHINA to come along with its questions on what constitutes sentience and what rights, if any, machines should be afforded should they ever develop it. EX MACHINA is a gripping science fiction drama featuring a pitch perfect cast and an intriguing premise. It stars Domhnall Gleeson as Caleb, a talented computer programmer working for the world's most prominent search engine company who wins a lottery with the grand prize being a week with the company's reclusive CEO at his estate. Expecting a week of relaxation and fun with the wealthiest man on the planet, Caleb is surprised when he meets Nathan (Oscar Isaac) and learns there is more to the prize than he thought. Nathan has developed a form of artificial intelligence and he wants Caleb to be the human element in a Turing test. He's introduced to Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he's nothing short of amazed at what Nathan has accomplished. Over the course of the next week, Caleb will have a series of sessions with Ava intending to determine whether she has reached the level of true sentience. But it's not so simple. Ava warns Caleb that Nathan isn't the friend he appears to be, leaving Caleb to wonder if something more sinister is occurring behind the scenes and who can be trusted.It's always hard for me to explain what I love so much about movies as fantastic as EX MACHINA because I get so caught up in the film that it's hard for me to break down what elements were so affective. I can't watch EX MACHINA without being sucked in; all of the little details escape me because I'm so engaged in the overall experience. I can say with certainty that the cast is top notch. With all respect to Gleeson, he does a great job as the audience surrogate, bringing us along with him into this bizarre scenario and reacting with perfection, but the real accolades belong to Isaac and Vikander. We'll start with Oscar Isaac as Nathan. His performance and this character are probably the most complex component of an already complex film. Nathan is probably the main reason EX MACHINA deserves at least a second viewing because you watch the film the first time and get a very definite vibe off the man. Then you see the ending, motives are revealed and everything is made clear, and the second viewing gives you the chance to re-examine his behavior. Nathan is made out to be somewhat unnerving from the moment we meet him. He lives alone in large subterranean estate on a massive plot of land and, while he comes across as friendly, there seems to be something going on underneath. Could be a more malevolent side we aren't seeing, or it could just be the secretive nature of his work causing him to play his hand close to his chest. Isaac plays it in the best way possible, leaving it ambiguous throughout. Alicia Vikander as Ava is equally notable. Ava has a beautiful purity to her. She hasn't been around long and what time she's been 'alive' has been spent trapped in the same room with only Nathan for social interaction. She's intelligent, observant, shy, and strangely beautiful for a being comprised of metal and plastic (though her face is the most human element and the only portion utilizing a faux skin). She is one of the most sympathetic characters I've seen in film and it's no surprise Caleb begins seeing her as more than a test subject.Isaac and Vikander are great enough on their own to warrant a recommendation for this film but praise needs to be shared with the rest of the cast and crew on this film. Garland's writing is tense and the beats are perfectly laid out, giving the film a mounting sense of dread leading to what you're sure will be a rocky conclusion. The production design is both simple and effective. Information from behind the scenes explains that Nathan's estate is done in minimalistic fashion because of budget constraints but it suits the character and the film. Nathan lives here but it's hardly a home; it's a workshop. And every so often, the characters will wander out of the constrictive house environment into the gorgeous Norwegian landscapes where the film was shot. And finally, the visual effects are sensational. Ava's design and execution is seamless; you never question what you're seeing. It's incredible and even stands above some of the bigger budget blockbuster FX- driven films crowding theaters in the summer. I really do love this film and science fiction fans would be doing themselves a disservice by missing out on EX MACHINA. It was one of the best films of 2015 and one of the most entertaining sci-fi films I've seen.",9,2,6,19 February 2016
Back to the Future Part III," Final Film is Fun Enough, but Missing Something
","Robert Zemeckis's fantastic time travel trilogy ends with a whimper. Well, all right, that may be a little harsh, but I don't feel it lived up to the fun of the first two. The finale finds Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) trapped in the wild west of 1885 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is determined to bring him back when he discovers Doc is murdered by local outlaw Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). It's got some fun moments but my favorite aspect of the trilogy, time travel, isn't as prominent this time around.After Marty arrives in 1885, the time travel element is put on hold for the duration of the film, as the DeLorean is temporarily out of commission. This is unfortunate, as the DeLorean is probably my favorite 'character' from the trilogy. Watching as Doc and Marty bounce around time to fix the paradoxes they create was always a blast; this time it's just a matter of getting back to the future before Tannen kills either one of them. We're also treated to a new love interest for Doc, in the form of Mary Steenburgen as schoolteacher Clara Clayton. It's nice to see Doc getting attention but it's still not what I was looking for in a BTTF film.The movie plays out like a generic western/fish-out-of-water comedy and is good for some laughs. Marty's reaction to antiquated life in the old west is funny enough and I loved the final act with Doc and Marty's final confrontation with Tannen and race against time to get the DeLorean up to speed. Still, of the three films, this film finds itself as the weak link in the chain. The cast is phenomenal as we've come to expect, and it really helps with the mediocre storyline. On the off chance you haven't already since this, don't expect the final installment of one of cinema's most memorable series to leave you completely satisfied, but at least you know you can count on an entertaining two hours.",7,2,3,14 September 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The Silver Surfer's First Film Appearance Deserved Better Treatment
","I don't know what it is about this movie that keeps me watching it every few months. It almost as if I need to watch it on occasion to remind myself how mediocre it is. It was hard to believe that a Marvel film utilizing one of the most interesting characters from the comic universe, Galactus, could be so bland. I suppose one of the reasons I keep returning to this film is that I want so badly to see the Fantastic Four franchise survive. I know it has potential; I love the characters, it has an interesting collection of villains to select from, and the comic series provides some great stories as starting material. It just isn't happening, thanks to poor writing and a little too much creative license at the hands of director Tim Story and writers Don Payne and Mark Frost.The second installment in the F4 franchise suffers from the some of the same problems as the first film, while adding some new issues on top. The story potential is high: Reed Richards and Susan Storm's wedding is postponed (again) when the Earth receives a visit from the Silver Surfer, herald of Galactus. Further complications arise when Victor von Doom returns with plans of his own. Just writing that synopsis made me want to watch the film again; it sounds like the foundation for a great F4 film. My issues began with the fact that we wasted the first 30 minutes of the film preparing for Reed and Sue's wedding instead of getting to the meat of the Silver Surfer plot. Then, once the plot kicks into gear, we're rushed through the next hour to a deus ex machina ending that fails to satisfy (and may even aggravate some of the comic series' fans). When the film was over, I felt as if the Surfer was never given the opportunity to reach his full on-screen potential and I've been left hoping he's given another shot.Just as in the first film, this movie is plagued with some cringe-worthy one-liners (once again, Doom is given some of the worst). I know the F4 was a bit goofier than some of the other Marvel properties but the filmmakers need to tone it down a bit. Though, I can deal with corny dialogue; what I can't abide is blatant slap-in-the-face product placement. I loved that the filmmakers were able to work the Fantasticar into the script (especially since I'd considered it a bit too cartoonish to work in a film) but the shout-out for Dodge when Johnny first sees it and excitedly exclaims 'A hemi!' went a bit too far.All of the original cast from the first film return, which is both good and bad. Just as before, Ioan Gruffudd, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are perfect choices for their characters and do a (no pun intended) fantastic job bringing their characters to life. Also, just as in the first film, I was unimpressed with the performances of Jessica Alba and Julian McMahon. Alba is a beautiful woman and fits the image of Susan Storm, but I've never felt her to be too talented an actress and she remains the weak point of the series. McMahon, again, does not feel right in the role of Dr. Doom; he has a hard time doing insidiously evil without coming across as a hammed performance and I just can't take him seriously. These are not traits I want in the man given the role as one of the best Marvel villains.For what time we're given with him, the Surfer is the most impressive aspect of this film. The visual effects team did a great job with creating the iconic character and Laurence Fishburne was an inspired casting choice for his voice. Galactus, unfortunately, does not receive the same treatment and we are never given a real glimpse at the demigod through his surrounding cloud. In my opinion, it was a waste but the director Tim Story clarified in the film's supplemental material that he chose to keep Galactus vague so that future filmmakers could do him justice. After two average films, now we need to hope someone is even given the chance.Honestly, this film will only appeal to fans of the series and, even then, don't expect to be wow'd. The second F4 film isn't a bad movie, but it never rises above mediocre. The impressive special effects and production design fall victim to plot holes, poor writing, and under-use of the film's assets. It's a quick, mildly entertaining means of spending 90 minutes but, if you're anything like me, you'll walk away from this film wondering what could have been if the epic introduction of the Silver Surfer and Galactus had been put in better hands.",6,17,25,16 January 2010
Transformers," Wild/Loud Summer Fun w/Robots
","I was not a Transformers kid when I grew up in the 80's and I think that's why I wasn't so hard on Michael Bay's film when I caught it in the summer of 2007. Going into the film for the first time, the only characters I knew by name were Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee (and I only knew of him through the mention of friends). So, without having the fanboy mentality, I was able to enjoy the movie as it was...and I did. I thought it was a fun action flick and one of the best popcorn movies from the year. Based on the Hasbro toyline and it's resulting animated series/comics, the film follows high-schooler Sam Witwicky who discovers his Camaro is a shape-shifting alien robot; he is soon brought into the middle of a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, warring factions of a race of sentient robots.Let's be honest. The only things that matter about this movie are the special effects and the action sequences. ILM did a fantastic job with the Transformers in this film. The robots look amazing and their transformations are seamless. I've heard that some classic fans aren't satisfied with their designs but I felt they did a good job adding what realism they could to giant fighting robots. The action sequences aren't as abundant as one would expect, but I'm not complaining. I felt there were enough action scenes without going overboard and drowning out story. The battles feel epic and they aren't heavily edited into quick jump cuts so you can still understand what is going on.The cast does an adequate job and keep the movie from feeling B-grade. Shia LaBeouf was charismatic and had a good sense of comedic timing; John Turturro was a fun addition as the mental Sector 7 agent Simmons. Jon Voight seemed almost out of place in the film, though added a bit of class. I know there have been a lot of complaints about human characters in the movie, but it's a necessary element and I'm not complaining. The supporting cast did a great job; my favorites had to be Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's eccentric parents. I felt the movie shouldn't have gone over 2 hours as it does begin to strain on the patience after a while but it still made for a fun ride.",8,53,78,17 August 2009
Men in Black II," At Best, it's Just a Lame Sequel to an Awesome Summer Movie
","MEN IN BLACK II is more than a major disappointment. It's a source of never-ending resentment from me. I loved the first film. The studio had no excuse not to bust out with a proper sequel that built upon the awesomeness started in the first movie and expand the universe further. MEN IN BLACK II came out a full five years after the first movie; it was plenty of time to develop a script that would do the franchise justice and keep the audience excited for further adventures with the MiB. But they didn't. MEN IN BLACK II is a blatant cash-grab and would go on to kill the franchise until it was dug out from it's grave for a third film in 2012. As you might remember, the first film ended with Agent K retiring from the agency to return to his normal life with Agent J starting his new life with the MiB. Within a few years, J has risen to become the most respected, hard-working agent with the organization and he has a reputation for growing tired of his partners, neuralyzing them, and sending them home to their normal lives. When a intergalactic threat returns to Earth after decades to continue a search for a powerful.somethingcalled the Light of Zartha, Zed directs J to the only agent with knowledge of the Light and the evil alien that continues to hunt it down: K or, as he's now known, Kevin Brown. J must re-recruit the organization's best agent and return his memories if he hopes to stop the alien threat beforeI'm not sure really. It's never made all that clear.Right, so from the very start we hit a major problem with MEN IN BLACK II: a lazy script. Or maybe the script wasn't lazy and the filmmakers dropped the ball. Regardless whose fault, we never quite know what exactly is going on in this movie. What exactly is the Light of Zartha? Why is it so important? What will Serleena, the movie's lame villain, do with it and how will it help her do whatever it is she wants to do? What danger does the Light of Zartha present to Earth and why? We never get any solid answers to any of this, just vague threats for which we're supposed to fear consequences that we never really learn. With the first movie, it was cut and dry: Edgar the interstellar cockroach wanted to steal the galaxy on Orion's belt for his own evil purposes and Earth was threatened when the galaxy's true owners arrive and demand we hand it over before they blow up the planet. There's no sense of tension if there's no determinable threat. This is exactly why I had completely lost interest in the movie before it even reached the final act.Upon watching MEN IN BLACK II, it was easy to see the thought processes going through the minds of director Barry Sonnenfeld and writers Robert Gordon and Barry Fanaro. The first movie was a hit so why not extract the more memorable elements from it and cram it down the audience's throat for 90 minutes. How else can you explain Frank the Pug's over the entire movie? He was a funny little scene in the first movie and now he's joined the MiB, partnered up with Agent J, and singing Ba-Ha Men becausewait for ithe's a dog. Get it?! On that same note, the 'worm guys' who were good for a laugh when introducing Agent J to aliens on Earth in the first movie are now back with quadruple the screen time. You see the problem? A lot of MEN IN BLACK II is just a rehashing of the some of the best moments of the original. The whole recruitment angle, while a little fresher with the tables turned and J reintroducing the world of the MiB to K, is just a throwback to the first film. Jack Jeebs, Tony Shalhoub's shady intergalactic arms dealer, returns for some more gags andyou guessed itmore screen time. It's all just more of the same with a more confusing plot.Now that the most aggravating parts of the movie are out of the way, I wish someone could explain to me that a sequel that was released five years after the originala sequel that was released the same year as SPIDER-MAN with its amazing visualshas effects on par with the cheesiest cable sci-fi movie. One of the coolest aspects of the first MEN IN BLACK was the perfect mix of practical creature effects and CG. The second installment amps up the CG effects without worrying about how bad they look. There's a scene in the beginning of the movie with Agent J confronting a giant alien worm in the subway tunnels. At some point he is holding on to the worm's back for dear life while careening down the tunnel, and it looks horrible. It was some blatant blue/green screen work that didn't come close to working. Serleena was even worse. In her 'human' form, she's a hot Lara Flynn Boyle. In her alien form, she's a mess of vines or tentacles or something and it just doesn't work. Same with Johnny Knoxville's second head. Knoxville is already a weak presence in the movie as Serleena's henchman but a horribly unconvincing second head compounds the lameness.The rest of the movie is just the filmmakers doing their best to appeal to the lowest common denominator: an alien with a scrotum on his chin called, unsurprisingly, a Ballchinian, a toilet gag with Agents J and K being 'flushed' out of MiB HQ, and both K and Zed getting moments to shine with crappy wirework and groan-inducing kung-fu. As a movie, MEN IN BLACK II is just lame. As a sequel to one of my beloved summer blockbusters, MEN IN BLACK II is nearly an insult.",4,3,4,25 June 2013
Event Horizon," Paul W.S. Anderson's Best Movie
","You know what I find most admirable about this film? It proves that Paul W.S. Anderson can create films that aren't mediocre (ALIEN VS. PREDATOR) or crap (MORTAL KOMBAT). I was never a fan of Anderson's films (though I admit DEATH RACE was some mindless fun) but this is the exception to the rule. In the film, a long-lost starship created for faster-than-light travel reappears mysteriously in orbit above Neptune. A rescue crew is dispatched with the ship's creator to recover any survivors and bring the ship home. Once they've arrived, they discover the crew is dead and the ship has returned from a dimension of unknown origins with a dark secret. The film is reminiscent of previous science fiction/horror such as ALIEN, with it's ominous feeling of danger in the isolation of deep space.A good sci-fi/horror is one of my weaknesses. This film has a decent blend of intriguing back-story combined with gore effects that continue to look impressive more than ten years later. Even now, the effects in the film are enough to churn my stomach at points. As a nice change of pace, the film even boasts a decent story, as the crew members of the rescue shuttle fight to escape a ship that's determined to keep them. There are a couple of cheap scares but there is also plenty of intrigue as the Event Horizon's original destination becomes clear.Sam Neill is wonderful as Dr. Weir, the original creator of the Event Horizon who feels himself drawn back to his brainchild inexplicably; Neill is a great actor in my opinion and it was interesting to see him in such a dark role. Laurence Fishburne is a powerful presence as Captain Miller, head of the rescue operation, and there are some strong supporting characters in the form of Joely Richardson and Jason Isaacs. In the end, though, my favorite character would have to be the Event Horizon herself and the evil presence it's taken on with it's return. I've got to give Anderson and his producers credit, as this is one of the best movies he's been attached to. If you're searching for an atmospheric, violent science fiction film, I'm happy to say Anderson's film may, for once, be something worth recommending.",8,0,1,22 November 2009
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Good Adaptation of Larsson's First Millennium Novel
","I remember this movie getting a lot of buzz when I was in college. A lot of other students were chatting about it, but I never really looked into it until David Fincher (one of my favorite directors) chose to adapt the book for American audiences in 2011. So yeah, I was a little late to the party when it came to appreciating Stieg Larsson's Millennium series. It was Fincher's adaptation that grabbed my attention and I've since read all three books and watched the extended additions of each of the three Swedish films. So now that I've had enough exposure to the series to form a reasonable opinion, let me say that I enjoyed the Swedish version directed by Niels Arden Oplev, but not as much as I enjoyed Fincher's version. THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is a complex story revolving around the forty-year-old unsolved disappearance of a sixteen-year-old girl. Controversial journalist Mikael Blomkvist has been disgraced in the courts when he's found guilty of libel against a billionaire industrialist. Facing a sentence of three months in prison, he's sought out by the wealthy Henrik Vanger to solve the mysterious disappearance of his niece Harriet in 1966. She disappeared without a trace and previous investigations have yielded nothing: no body, no evidence of foul play. Just gone. Henrik believes a member of his unsavory family murdered Harriet, and he hopes Mikael can find the answer he's been waiting for. But Mikael will need help, and he turns to antisocial computer hacker Lisbeth Salander, a woman with a mountain of her own issues, to solve the case.Having read the book before I watched the Swedish film, I know that a lot was left on due to time constraints. The book is just too detailed to fit everything into a feature film of reasonable length (and this movie already pushes the boundary with a total three hour runtime). The exhaustive detail behind the Wennerström affair, Blomkvist's brief tryst with Cecilia Vanger, further details about his investigation into Harriet's disappearance, and more were removed to trim the story down to a manageable length. I'm cool with that. I understand, and the movie still manages to put together a taut mystery that will keep you engaged until the final reveal. If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, be forewarned: these are slow-burning story lines. Both the book and the movie move pretty slowly at times and can take a while to get moving, but grab hold of you when they do. Mikael's investigation involves a lot of searching through archives and old photos so it doesn't always make for the most interesting cinema material. Fortunately, just when your interest threatens to weaken, the movie throws out a curve-ball to thrust you back into the story. It's a rich story that does weaken a bit when adapted for the screen, so I'd certainly recommend anyone who enjoyed the movie to seek out the book as well if for no other reason than to fill out the rest of the story.I'm not going to bother comparing the primary cast members here to those in Fincher's film because they're separate entities and I felt both did admirable jobs in filling the roles from the novel. Noomi Rapace is Lisbeth Salander, the title heroine of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. She does a pretty awesome job bringing Lisbeth's her awkward antisocial personality to life, but there were times when it didn't feel legitimate. It wasn't enough to rip me out of a scene or anything, just a minor nitpick and a minor complaint. In general, I thought Rapace did a fine job embracing this character and I she was a great choice for the trilogy. The same can be said for Michael Nyqvist as Blomkvist. I had a hard time accepting him at first because I had come to envision Daniel Craig in the role, but he grew on me fast and I've come to believe he was an excellent choice. I'd even go so far as to say he was a better fit for the character than Craig in terms of style and personality. The two of them have great chemistry between them that helps their odd relationship work. The two of them were inspired casting on the film's part and establish themselves solidly in the characters they would then portray in two more movies. This deliberately-paced foreign film may not appeal to mass American audiences, but those of us who were willing to give it a chance are in for a good film.",8,0,2,6 March 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," An Awesome, Fun Space Adventure from Marvel Studios
","Marvel Studios got smart with their Phase II films. The first phase was fun but I worried that I would reach a point of over-saturation where I might grow tired of their formula. Then they proved they had more tricks up their sleeve when they introduced the concept of incorporating other genres into the world of comic book films. THE WINTER SOLDIER was a political thriller and now GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is a space adventure in the vein of the Star Wars films. When Marvel announced their Phase II series, I was the only one in my group of friends who got more excited for this film than the continuing adventures of Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America. No, I'd never heard of the Guardians before and that was probably what was most intriguing. It was something different. I immediately jumped on Wikipedia to get some idea as to what to expect and was quickly overwhelmed with the bizarre details of the characters and their cosmic adventures. I couldn't wait to see how it was handled on film. With the announcement of James Gunn as director, it solidified itself as my most anticipated film of 2014. In GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, we're introduced to Peter Quill (Christ Pratt). Quill was abducted from Earth as a child and has since led the life of an interstellar outlaw, referring to himself as Star-Lord. His most recent acquisition is a mysterious orb of unknown power that draws the attention of an infamous Kree fanatic, Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). Ronan has been tasked with retrieving the orb and presenting it to Thanos, the major villain Marvel has been teasing since the end of THE AVENGERS in 2012. Quill's adventures lands him in an unstable alliance with fellow outcasts in an effort to keep the orb from Ronan's hands: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper).I almost feel as if GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY is Marvel Studios' means of giving the finger to DC/Warner Bros. As much trouble as Warner has had in bringing DC comics successfully to the big screen, Marvel wanted to flaunt it's skills by making a movie featuring an anthropomorphic tree and talking raccoon as two of it's main characters. Regardless of their reasons, it worked and GUARDIANS skyrocketed to the top of my favorite Marvel movies to join the ranks of IRON MAN, IRON MAN 3 (yes, I liked it), and THE AVENGERS. James Gunn was an inspired choice for the job of directing the film and I knew from the time he was announced that this was a film to keep an eye on (I loved his 2010 film, SUPER). He brings an oddball humor to a film that needs it, where we're immersed in colorful aliens, strange new worlds, andI repeata talking raccoon. In the end, it was the characters that really made this movie as fun and effective as it is. The casting was top notch and every member of the cast understands the vibe of the movie and plays into it perfectly. Chris Pratt was the perfect choice for the role of Quill and his comedic timing really set the tone from the very start as Quill is dancing his way through some ancient ruins to the tune of Redbone's 'Come and Get Your Love'. Groot and Rocket were, of course, audience favorites because they were the oddest of an already out-there cast. Groot, a humanoid plant, acts as the muscle for Rocket in their bounty-hunting duo but, despite his size and strength, is a softie at heart. Rocket is the resident wise-cracker with an attitude more than large enough to compensate for his size. Zoe Saldana is her usual strong presence as Gamora, former assassin under the employment of Thanos and Ronan, but the real surprise for me was Bautista as Drax. I'll admit some of his dialogue comes across a little clunky but he had some great moments and was surprisingly good at giving his character some depth. With the exception of the Rock, I'm generally against pro-wrestlers turning mainstream actor but Bautista might be a new exception to the rule.The characters are certainly the strongest point in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY but they don't all get the chance for full development. Marvel has been notorious with an issue of under-developing its villains and Ronan is no different. He's got the look and he's got the attitude and Lee Pace gives a rage-fueled performance, but we don't learn much about him other than he's a Kree with a never-ending hatred for a race know as Xanderians. We get no further information as to why the Kree and Xanderians are at odds or why Ronan refuses to let go of his blood vendetta even after the two species agreed to a cease-fire. Ronan had the potential to be one of the coolest villains in the MCU but he's left one-dimensional. The same can be said for Korath the Pursuer (Djimon Hounsou). Hounsou is a phenomenal actor but he's pretty much wasted in his minor role as Ronan's enforcer. Nebula (Karen Gillan) is done slightly better. At least we get hints at her history (genetically and cybernetically modified by Thanos to be a killing machine) and her motivations (anger/revenge against Thanos and Gamora). Then there's the complaint of the pretty basic story. GUARDIANS relies on it's eccentric characters to keep the movie fun (which it does) and sacrifices plot, giving us the most basic of story lines we've come to expect from Marvel. The villain is trying to get an item, it can provide ultimate power, the heroes need to stop him. It's an unfortunate side-effect for any of these movies tying into the whole 'Infinity Gauntlet' plot line running through the franchise. They're limited to repeating the same steps. Regardless of these flaws though, GUARDIANS is the some of the most fun I've had in a Marvel film and easily recommended.",9,2,4,25 July 2015
Evil Dead," A Brutal, Visceral Modern Vision of the Cult Favorite
","This is the part where I make the most obsessive of fans' stomachs churn: I didn't hate the new EVIL DEAD. Not only did I not hate it, I actually had fun with it. It's no masterpiece and it doesn't come close to the level of Sam Raimi's original cult favorite, but it's good enough for what it is. Let's face it: remakes are the current go-to cash grab in Hollywood and just about every film you've ever loved is probably going to be rebooted, remade, reimagined, etc. at some point in the near future. EVIL DEAD might be a popular example as to a property that didn't need modernization, but I believe it to be a lot better than most people give it credit. There are a lot of, admittedly, viable complaints about the new movie but, if you can overlook some of it's problems, there is some awesome stuff here. The movie is an all-too-familiar premise: five friends are secluding themselves away in the woods in a long-abandoned cabin. As opposed to the average 'cabin-in-the-woods' horror movie, these friends have a purpose behind their visit besides boozing and debauchery: David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his friends have gathered for his sister Mia (Jane Levy) to help her kick a nasty heroin habit. They've brought her out to the woods, away from temptation and escape, to help her get clean. The cabin belongs to their family but they haven't used it in a while, and it's since been used for other sinister purposes. In the basement, sitting among the remains of some bizarre occult ritual, the friends discover a flesh-bound book wrapped in barbed wire and unleash an ancient evil with their meddling.Before I explain why I don't hate this movie, let me clarify that, yes, I have seen the original EVIL DEAD movies but it's been over ten years. I don't own them in my collection, not because I don't want to, but because I'm a sucker for the best edition of a movie on DVD with the most in-depth special features and the EVIL DEAD movies have about three billion different DVD editions and each has their own separate group of special features. When attempting to decide which edition was best, my brain shut down from all the input and I just gave up. Maybe some dayFor starters, I love the look and feel of this movie. It's gritty and gloomy, the woods are constantly fogged over and give the cabin an even more remote feeling. This place truly feels like it's own little world and there is no escape when the evil forces join the fun. It's isolated and claustrophobic. Then there's the fact that everything in this movie has a grimy feel. Everything seems wet and dirty, and the colors are pretty muted with the whole movie having a very neutral tone with the exception of the color red. It seems to me the filmmakers really wanted the red here to pop. There's so many earth tones, blacks, and grays that the blood gets an extra visual bang when it explodes on the screen. And explode it does because this movie is easily one of the most brutally violent I've seen in a good long time. Maybe this is because I'm not the biggest horror fan but my experience with modern horror movies is limited to some smaller indie shockers and horror anthologies. EVIL DEAD is incredibly graphic and people with a weaker stomach might want to just skip it. I've got an iron stomach for movie gore but I'll admit there were a few moments in this movie that had me cringing. Dismemberments, immolation, blood, vomit, carvings, and on and on. There should be enough here to satisfy gore hounds, but I need a bit more than that to really dig a movie.My problem with horror movies, and I've mentioned this in other comments on here, is that there's little focus on character development because we know as an audience going in that most of these characters are just there to die gruesome deaths. No sense in giving a character more personality than your average archetype if you're just going to disembowel them a half hour into the film, right? Well, that makes for boring times whenever there's a lull in the action because I don't care what the characters have to say. At least the characters in EVIL DEAD are fleshed out enough to give them a little purpose. We learn about David and Mia and their tormented histories. Olivia (Jessica Lucas) is some sort of nurse, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) is a high school teacher, and both come in handy a bit with their fun in the cabin. Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) is nothing more than David's girlfriend and serves no purpose other than a wicked little throwback to the original film with the help of an electric carving knife. I'm not saying these characters are well-written, flesh and bloodbut we know a little about them, they're distinct personalities (except for Natalie), and they contribute a little to the film.Still, above-average horror film characters and enough blood and guts to open a hot dog factory are not enough for me to find more than a passing interest in the movie and, for the first two thirds of the film or so, I wasn't all that impressed. I was entertained enough but I wasn't wow'd. But then we came to the final act. The movie fooled with about an hour in when it seemed everything was wrapping up and coming to a close. I was disappointed and ready to write this movie off as throwaway entertainmentbut then, the movie kicks into overdrive and takes a sudden left turn into CrazyTown. I'm not going to spoil anything here about the end but it was so over-the-top that it saved my opinion of the movie at the last minute.",8,4,8,27 September 2013
The Imitation Game," Cumberbatch is Perfect as Alan Turing; a Great Film
","THE IMITATION GAME is the story of Alan Turing, a man who contributed to the Allied victory in World War II and was rewarded with eventual charges of 'gross indecency' (for homosexuality). It's an engaging film that details his time served in Bletchley Park during the war where he worked with a team of linguists for the British military in attempting the decipher the German's Enigma code. The details certainly differ from their real life counterparts but, in the film, the Enigma code is a thorn in the side of the Allied forces that was proving unbreakable. Turing arrives at Bletchley Park and signs on to use his considerable intellect and love of puzzles to crack the code, and he's placed on a team that he immediately alienates with his intense focus on building a code-cracking machine. Throughout the film, we're flashing backward and forward in time to his childhood friendship with a young classmate (which develops into a school crush and establishes Turing's budding homosexuality) and his future discovery at the hands of the police for his alternate 'indecent' lifestyle that would signal the beginning of the end to Turing's accomplished life. THE IMITATION GAME is at once both a celebration of Turing's (and his team's) unsung accomplishments that aided in bringing about an early end to the war and a reminder of how intolerance is blind and even a war hero such as Turing can fall victim to those hateful and afraid of people who might think differently.Alan Turing is one of Benedict Cumberbatch's best performances. Between Turing and Sherlock Holmes, it seems Cumberbatch is just incredibly talented at portraying socially awkward geniuses. But Turing is the more challenging role. Sure, personality-wise the two characters can certainly be said to have a lot in common, but the tragedy of Turing's life is just as much the focus of the film and Cumberbatch creates a sympathetic man suffering in silence. Being the time period that it was, Turing was unable to live openly without fear of repercussions and he poured all of his energy into creating his code-breaker (named 'Christopher' after his beloved childhood friend). His team is built on an exceptional supporting cast containing Keira Knightley as Joan Clarke (the only woman on the team who quickly becomes Turing's closest friend) and Matthew Goode as Hugh Alexander (an English chess champion and the team's alpha). Turing and Alexander butt heads immediately over the direction the team is taking in cracking the Enigma, and it's Joan who helps Turing earn the team's friendship and, more importantly, trust in the viability of the machine. Rounding out the impressive cast of supporting characters are Charles Dance as Commander Denniston, the man in charge of the project who happens to believe Turing is a problem and his machine a waste of national funds, and Mark Strong as Stewart Menzies, the head of MI-6 who sees the potential in Turing and his plan. Strong (who starred in another really good espionage thriller with CumberbatchTINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) is always a welcome presence and perfect for the shady position as head of an intelligence agency thatas far as anyone knew at the timedidn't exist.THE IMITATION GAME is paced like an espionage thriller but spends the bulk of the film on the dynamics of Turing and his team. Turing, in the film, is not an easy man to get along with. He's vastly intelligent but he's unskilled at the nuances of social interactions. He often speaks his mind, regardless of consequences of the feelings of others, and his team isn't keen on him from the start. It doesn't help that early on he goes over Denniston's head (to Churchill, no less) to assume command of the project and immediately fires two less-helpful teammates. Joan is the key to his integration into the crew and helps him earn the respect he needs to coordinate them. But while the main plot in the film is the cracking of Enigma, the secondary story of Turing's later prosecution for his 'crime' of homosexuality is always looming over us. Anyone familiar with Turing knew how this was bound to end and the movie gradually leads us there while first showing us the impressive individual he was, making his horrible treatment in the end that much more disgusting. THE IMITATION GAME is a solid World War II tale of spies and the men behind the scenes but it's also a timely reminder, at a point when finding widespread tolerance is still a challenge, that we're all human and something as innocent as sexual orientation is not enough to define (orworsepersecute) a person.",8,1,3,15 December 2015
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Sexy, Stylized Ultraviolence
","Quentin Tarantino returns after six years with his fourth film, an homage to the kung-fu/revenge flicks of the 70's. Uma Thurman plays the Bride, an assassin who abandons her murderous lifestyle and tries to settle down into a normal life. Unfortunately, her former boss, Bill, has other plans and turns the wedding into a bloodbath. Four years later, she awakens from a coma and begins the path of vengeance. Tarantino split the movie into two volumes so this movie doesn't present her full quest.Tarantino's film is a bloody throwback to the kung-fu flicks he grew up with. The story is simple but the film's style more than makes up for its simplicity. The choreography of the fight scenes is phenomenal. Uma Thurman kicks some serious butt, obviously having trained long and hard for her role. I'd have to say my favorite is the Bride's duel with O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). Between the grace of the combatants and the Latin sound of 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood' by Santa Esmeralda, it feels almost like a violent tango. During the epic fights, blood erupts like a volcano from nearly every wound. It looks ridiculous (but cool) and still people freak out about the amount of bloody violence.Of course, with the fantastic fight sequences, we get a good dose of Tarantino's writing, with its sharp dialogue. You can tell everyone starring in this movie is having a blast and enjoys playing their roles. One of my favorite highlights of the movie is Sonny Chiba in his role as Hattori Hanzo (a reference to one of his most popular kung-fu roles). Liu and Vivica Fox are fantastic as the Bride's first targets on her 'Death List Five'. There really is a lot to enjoy in this movie if you're looking for a good, hyper-violent time. Tarantino's throwback to the 70's grindhouse kung-fu style is a great follow-up to his previous work and one of the most entertaining films he's put out yet.There are a lot of complaints about this movie but viewers have to realize, this is what Tarantino wanted. He stayed true to the style of the old martial arts flicks and modernized with his own flair. Yes, there is A LOT of blood but it's almost cartoonish in quantity. For me, this is one of those simple guilty pleasures: check your logic at the door and settle in for some great entertainment.",9,0,3,25 December 2007
Jurassic World," It Wasn't What I Hoped; Shallowly Entertaining
","The original JURASSIC PARK is and always will be one of my favorite movies. I even enjoyed THE LOST WORLD more than most people. I've read Michael Crichton's novels more times than I can remember. So yes, I am a fan. I wasn't thrilled at the idea of reopening the movie franchise more than a decade since the third film solidified my belief that the series had run out of steam. I was cautiously optimistic when I read that Colin Trevorrow, director of the fun SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED, was brought on to helm the project and I was even more excited when Chris Pratt was cast in one of the lead roles. Trevorrow was loud and proud about his love for the original '93 film, so I began to believe he might do the series justice and somehow reinvigorate it. JURASSIC WORLD seems to ignore the previous two sequels, setting it in an operational and mega-successful park built on Isla Nublar. Claire (Bryce Dallas-Howard) is the operations manager, whom we meet when she's balancing a busy schedule of shuffling off her visiting nephews onto her disinterested assistant and presenting the park's newest attraction, the Indominus Rex, to potential investors. Meanwhile, former Navy SEAL and Ingen contractor Owen (Pratt) takes a break from training a team of velociraptors to inspect the Indominus's pen for safety concerns; in what should come as a surprise to no one, the Indominus outsmarts Owen and the park crew and escapes from its pen, endangering the lives of thousands of park guests as it murders its way across the island.Trevorrow was not lying when he expounded on his love for the original film. In fact, JURASSIC WORLD is his love letter to it and it's probably the film's biggest flaw. You can't go more than a few minutes without some sort of reference to JURASSIC PARK. The visitors' center is featured in a sequence where we see the 'When Dinosaurs Roamed the Earth' and skeletal remains from the climactic moment. We see a night vision headset (twice!), famous from the T-rex escape sequence. There's little nods scattered around in the background (visual and audio) and even a character in the Jurassic World control room (Lowery, played by Jake Johnson) who seems to encapsulate Trevorrow's own raging fandom. A few references would've been fine but, by the time the film was halfway over, it just made me wish I was watching the original film. I wanted JURASSIC WORLD to be its own film, reminding us why we loved the '93 film without constantly nudging us with its elbow, winking, and murmuring 'Remember that part? It was cool, wasn't it?' Even the core plot is pretty much a slightly modified version of the original: dinosaurs get loose, rational man who knows what he's doing makes it his mission to bring two key children back to safety, big climactic moment to close it out. Except the characters in the original film always felt as if they were in constant danger. There was suspense. JURASSIC WORLD isn't all that suspenseful. Maybe it's because the dinosaurs are 99% CG now. Sure, they look pretty good but, no matter how many people the Indominus swallows whole, it's never as scary as the T-rex was in the first film. The lack of suspense could also be attributed to the hollow feeling behind the action. Most of the deaths are nameless extras, be they asset containment crew or park guests. The moment when I knew this would never live up to JURASSIC PARK: when a helicopter crashes in a fiery, gratuitous, unmotivated explosion just so it can happen with the Indominus roaring in the foreground for that perfect 'trailer shot'. It was almost offensive in how cheesy that moment felt.Speaking of cheesyhow about that final confrontation with the Indominus? I'm not going to lie. That whole sequence had me rolling my eyes. Especially at the end. Not going to spoil anything here, but you'll probably know what I'm referring to. I'm being sort of hard on JURASSIC WORLD but that's only because I wanted it to try harder. It's not a bad film. It's still pretty entertaining. It's got some great casting (Pratt, Johnson, Irrfan Khan as the park owner, Vincent D'Onofrio as a nefarious Ingen overseer) and I loved the concept of setting the film in an operational park. On the topic of D'Onofrio's character and the whole subplot of 'trained' velociraptors: I was wary at first but I thought it was done well. If anything, I think it should've been the main plot the film or, at the very least, saved for a sequel. The sequence in the middle of the film where the raptors are given a field test (which is glimpsed in the trailer with Pratt running with the pack on a motorcycle) was probably the best part of the movie. Overall, I felt JURASSIC WORLD was a tad overrated and, while it was an entertaining couple of hours, teamed with AGE OF ULTRON to jumpstart the 'Summer of 'Meh'' (a term I've come to use for the summer blockbuster season of 2015 where I was continuously underwhelmed). Based on the money this film raked in (all of it), a sequel was guaranteed and, just as I was for JURASSIC WORLD, I'm hopeful. This spent too much time pining over the franchise's glory days but there were some promising nuggets in there. For anyone who for some reason hasn't seen it already, it's worth a watch and you'll probably really enjoy it. Personally, I'm more interested in where the franchise goes from here.",8,14,22,28 March 2016
Mission: Impossible II," Two Mind-Numbing Hours of Slow Motion and Explosions
","I hadn't seen this movie in years and, with all the ROGUE NATION excitement last year, I sat down and revisited MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2. I'd seen it in theaters back in the summer of 2000 and I vaguely remember enjoying it, but not as much as the first film. Watching it again more than a decade later, I see just how lame it really is. As a fan of the series who's excited to see it doing so well now that we're five movies in, I was disappointed to go back to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 and find myself bored out of my mind. It's a prime example of throwaway entertainment. The action is dull, the characters are bland, and the stakes never feel important. Directed by action maestro John Woo, the focus is on style while plot and characters take a distant backseat. In his second big screen mission, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is assigned to retrieve a genetically modified form of influenza that kills its victim within 24 hours. It (and the matching antivirus) was stolen by fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) who's gone rogue and plans to use it to embezzle money from the corrupt owner of the company that created it. Part of that plan is, of course, to release it on the unsuspecting public and reap profits while innocents die. To get the inside scoop on Ambrose's plans, Hunt recruits the man's former lover, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton) to reignite their relationship and report her findings to Hunt and the IMF.I honestly can't believe Roger Ebert gave this movie a positive reviewGeez, where to begin? I guess the action and John Woo's 'style'. From the little bit of his work I've seen (i.e. a few of his American projects), I'm just not a fan. He can certainly craft an intense action scene but he's also got a lot of trademark visuals that he uses to nauseating extremes here. No, not his doves. The dove doesn't appear to the very end of the film. The slow motion. So much slow motion. It's used everywhere in this movie and all the time. Eyes meeting across a room? Slow motion. Eyes meeting between drivers in a high-speed chase? Slow motion. Walking? Slow motion. Jumping? Slow motion. Slow motion? Slow motion. Run this film at normal speed and you could probably fit it as a one-hour M:I television special with commercials. And then there's the gratuitous use of explosions. I love a good movie explosion as long as it's motivated. In MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, if a car so much as hits a speed bump too fast it's liable to explode in a blaze of glory. Personally, vehicle crashes are more interesting without the explosion because you get a better view of the impact, rather than another identical (improbable) fireball. MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: 2 is first and foremost an action film, but when the bullet wounds are bloodless and vehicles explode for seemingly no reason it feels cheap and pandering like toilet humor in non- funny comedies.It all made sense when I was watching a promotional puff-piece for the film and writer Robert Towne explained that he was approached with a series of action set-pieces designed by Woo and Cruise. He was asked to write the script around the action. As a result, we wind up with a weak story of Ethan Hunt and his team chasing a vaguely-threatening MacGuffin and a forgettable villain. I don't know much about IMF operations and hiring practices but you'd think someone would've noticed Ambrose was getting ready to go full-blown villain. As much as an IMF agent is expected to endure in the course of their job, you'd think they'd have team psychologist to check in on them and maybe realize that they had a psychopath in the field. Ambrose falls far short of being an awesome antagonist on the level of Jon Voight in the first film or Philip Seymour Hoffman in the third. We know nothing of his motivations other than he wants to be rich and he has zero qualms about killing entire populations to do so. To get at Ambrose, Hunt is forced to recruit Nyah and use her as bait. WhichOKbut once Ambrose's location was discovered, why not pull Nyah out and go all IMF on his base of operations? Isn't that their job? Instead, she gets to play spy, putting her civilian life in danger to report information that Hunt could've obtained with one of his crazy awesome IMF infiltration missions.So many complaintswhat can I say positively about MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2? Tom Cruise continues to be awesome as Ethan Hunt. I love the work he's done in this franchise and the fact that he insists on doing his own stunts is impressive. The opening with Hunt free-climbing is that much more intense because we can see it's Cruise on the side of that rocky cliff-face. Ving Rhames is always a cool presence, even if his character is one-note in his fashion obsession this time around. And the M:I theme got a nice rock upgrade for this film. Still, you're better off skipping this one and moving on to MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3.",4,5,6,23 January 2016
Black Snake Moan," Gripping Blues-Fueled Tale of Salvation
","This movie blew me away. I'm not sure what I was expecting going in, but the poster art had definitely grabbed my attention. I had seen director Craig Brewer's previous hit, HUSTLE & FLOW, and thought it was great. Brewer continues the music theme with BLACK SNAKE MOAN, a blues-fueled tale of one man's search for salvation through his attempt to help rescue another. Samuel L. Jackson is Lazarus, an aging blues musician whose wife just ran off with his brother. One morning, he comes across the beaten unconscious form of Rae, a local girl with a wild reputation as a nymphomaniac, on the road outside his home. Lazarus takes her home, nurses her back to health, and decides to help her change her wicked ways; to ensure she doesn't run off in the meantime, he chains her to the radiator in his living room.This stands out as one of Jackson's best performances and I feel it was a crime that he received no awards (or nominations) for it. His character is a deeply troubled man who's come upon hard times and this is no better displayed than when he busts out his guitar to belt out some blues. Jackson performs his own vocals and even learned to play the guitar for this role, giving his performances that extra authenticity. Christina Ricci is equally perfect as Rae, injecting her with Southern sass while letting bits of purity seep out as Laz's lessons finally begin to reach her. She was the best possible choice to play this role; I don't believe any other actress would've been as able to bring the same beauty, strength, and eventual innocence to the character. Probably the biggest surprise upon viewing this movie was how well Justin Timberlake did in his supporting role as Rae's boyfriend Ronnie, a boy with severe anxiety who's departure for the military sets off the chain of events in the film. I had not seen Timberlake act prior to this film and I was beyond impressed with his capabilities.The film is strengthened through the wonderful supporting cast, particularly John Cothran as Laz's best friend and local preacher R.L. Still, the most important supporting player in this film remains the music. Brewer uses the blues as a tool for Lazarus and Rae to exorcise themselves of their demons and this is best displayed in a scene where Laz performs the title song ('Black Snake Moan') to Rae one stormy evening and we watch as Laz pours his heart out while Rae struggles to cope with traumatic events from her past. The film culminates into a third act that didn't have the same emotional kick as the rest of the film, but still leaves the characters with hope for a better future. I've seen that many attribute this movie's poor box office performance to poor marketing but I hope that through word-of-mouth this film will find a grander audience, as it's a powerful movie that I recommend to anyone who's ever had the blues.",8,1,3,24 March 2010
The Hangover Part II," Been There, Done That (But Still Funny)
","While 2011 had its share of misfires in theaters, none were so insulting as THE HANGOVER PART II. Not because of it's darker humor and edgier content as compared to the first movie. I'm cool with that. Not even because I thought it was a bad movie; in fact, if you view the movie as a standalone (rather than a sequel) it's still a pretty funny flick. No, the movie is insulting because it's the exact same movie as the first. Now, I was a fan of the first movie and would probably include it in my top ten favorite from 2009 but that doesn't mean a studio can regurgitate the same exact film to me in a different setting. If you've seen the first film, the plot is near identical but here's the rundown anyway: Stu (Ed Helms) is getting married in Thailand and invites his fellow Wolf Pack along for the celebration. Despite actively trying to avoid a repeat of the events in Las Vegas, he awakens the morning after an innocent beer on the beach with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) in a rundown Bangkok motel room. Stu realizes his fiancé's little brother Teddy (Mason Lee) hassurprise!...gone missing at some point during their night-long bender. Time is running out as the three hapless members of the Wolf Pack comb the dangerous streets of Bangkok for Teddy before the wedding is ruined. Sound familiar? I thought so. And it gets worse than that.Director Todd Phillips and the screenwriters essentially treated the original HANGOVER like a Mad Libs, erasing key words and phrases and substituting new elements in their place. The filmmakers' laziness goes well beyond rehashing the same plot in a new locale. The tiger from the first movie is replaced with a Buddhist monk, the baby is replaced with a drug-peddling monkey, and Stu's missing tooth is traded for a Mike Tyson facial tattoo. Celebrity cameos? We've got them too: Paul Giamatti as a local crime boss and Nick Cassavetes as a tattoo artist. A familiar face from the first film even makes a bonus appearance at the end of the movie just to seal the connection (but I won't spill details in case you haven't seen it). Oh, and speaking of the end of the movie: can you guess how it ends? If you answered with 'a series of photos depicting the debauchery of the missing night just like the first movie', you're either a mediocre psychic or possess common sense. I'm serious: beat for beat, this movie follows the same formula as the first movie. And it made ridiculous money at the box office. Warner Bros must've been laughing all the way to the bank on this one. If they hadn't been released in such close proximity, I'd have guess it was revenge for the poor reception towards their GREEN LANTERN box office bomb. As if my rant hasn't been enough proof, I'm really aggravated with how we were cheated here.But it's not a terrible movie. It's still funny. Not as funny as the last one, granted, but you can't expect the gags to carry the same weight when we've seen them before. The Bangkok setting and the audience's preconception of the city as the ultimate cesspool of transsexual prostitutes and underage sex slaves give the story the chance to move into darker territory. If you thought Stu's marriage to a stripper was rough luck in the first movie, he's get it a whole lot worse here. The entire original cast return to reprise their roles and, seeing as how they demonstrated their awesome buddy chemistry in the first movie, we have no reason to worry that they won't deliver. Galifianakis has some great moments in this movie. I loved his awkward dinner speech and there's a great moment about halfway through the movie where we see the world through his eyes (he envisions himself and his friends as kids as they tear through Bangkok in drugged out party-mode). Ken Jeong returns as Mr. Chow and, while his schtick wears a little thin at times, he's still good for some funny. If you haven't seen the first HANGOVER, there's a good chance you will enjoy this movie more than the rest of us. As a standalone movie, it works (as long as you're not easily offended/overly conservative). For the rest of us, it's a retread of old territory so blatant that you know you've been cheated by the end but the Wolf Pack is a fun enough group of guys that it doesn't suck so bad.",7,0,0,26 January 2012
Prisoners," A Powerful Tale that Blurs the Line Between Right/Wrong
","There was so much positive buzz when PRISONERS premiered on the festival circuit that I really expected it to have some presence at awards time. As the father of a little girl, I had a little extra bias settling in to watch this movie because the idea of a father in a desperate search for his missing daughter is a terrifying thought. PRISONERS did not disappoint on any front: the story, the acting, the tension. It's a movie that grips you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end credits begin to roll. It's a dark little film that touches on the blurring of right and wrong and what is acceptable to save the life of someone you love. PRISONERS begins on Thanksgiving as the Dovers and the Birch family come together to celebrate. The youngest daughters of each family, Anna and Joy, go outside unattended and disappear without a trace. The only clue was a beaten old RV that had been seen driving around the neighborhood. Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is assigned to locate the missing girls and the RV is traced to Alex Jones (Paul Dano), a man with the mental faculties of a ten-year-old child. Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) believes Jones knows where his daughter is being kept and, when Loki and the police aren't working fast enough, he takes matters into his own hands. He grabs Jones and locks him away in an old abandoned family home and begins his own investigation. Every minute counts as Loki and Keller race to find the missing girls before it's too late.PRISONERS is a very deliberately paced film and, at two and a half hours, you'll be surprised that at no point does it feel its length. It's a potboiler of a movie, building tension slowly so that the moments of extreme action hit you that much harder. The movie is a bit more complex than just, 'How do we make a mentally-challenged, potentially dangerous man give us information?' Loki's investigation and the story behind the girls' abductions (as well as countless other unfortunate children before them) is almost more interesting than Keller going off on his own for his vigilante approach. The movie has the occasional red herring to throw the detective (and the audience) off course but it's never done without reason. Every person involved in the story, from the pedophile priest to the creepy stranger lurking at the girls' candlelight vigil, has some connection to the story and the people behind the disappearances. Moments that appear trivial at first are later revealed to be vital information in piecing together the over-arching story. What I'm getting at is that the movie is pleasantly complex and keeps you engaged until the screen fades to black. You never really know what to expect and you start to question how far is too far. After everything's been revealed at the end, it still leaves you wondering if all of the pain inflicted in the pursuit of saving lives was justifiable. I love that there's no right answer. What seems right at the beginning and has you gritting your teeth and silently encouraging Keller later has you looking back and thinking just how much fear can blind a person to rationality.All of this comes together with help from some great cinematography from Roger Deakins and a powerful cast. The entire movie's got a dreary, overcast feel. It's set in the winter and, when it's not pouring rain, it's a bleak gray clouded sky giving this movie not a single bright moment. It's got a strong sense of atmosphere to compliment a painful story. The cast in PRISONERS is phenomenal. Hugh Jackman breaks away from playing the X-MEN's Wolverine for a bit to portray a character with more range than cynicism and rage. That's not to say Keller doesn't have his share of rage in the film, but he sprinkles in desperation, fear, and undying determination. From the beginning of the film, we are introduced to Keller as somewhat of a religious man with a sense of preparedness for any situation. He lectures his son about how you should be prepared in the event of any catastrophe in which the rules of society might break down. Unfortunately, the one event Keller never planned for was the one in which he finds himself now and he devolves into an entirely new animal over the course of the film. Jake Gyllenhaal continues to remind me that I don't give him enough credit as an actor. His character, Loki (not the God of Mischief sort), is a skilled investigator. He's hasn't been assigned to a missing persons case that he hasn't solved. The disappearance of Anna and Joy poses his first real struggle and it's only made worse by Keller's interference. He's just a man trying to do his job and save these girls but everyone seems to be working against him. We get Maria Bello, Viola Davis, and Terrence Howard in supporting roles and Paul Dano as the mentally deficient Alex Jones. He's creepy and off-putting, but is he capable of something so horrible? The movie keeps you guessing and Dano's just great.There's not much more to say. I really enjoyed PRISONERS. I would've like to see it get more recognition but I suppose it's not surprising when you look at some of the other late year additions to the awards race. It's a great movie but doesn't compare to movies 12 YEARS A SLAVE or even American HUSTLE. It got lost in the shuffle but I hope it finds plenty of attention on home video from an audience to appreciate it.",8,1,2,3 May 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Fell a Bit Short of My Expectations, but It's a Decent Sequel
","I am an unabashed fan of THE AVENGERS. I understand it has its flaws, particularly in the pacing, but I paid my money for a geek spectacle and that's exactly what was delivered. I count it as one of the best comic book movies, up there with THE DARK KNIGHT. Now that we've gotten a sequel, I expected more. I held AGE OF ULTRON to a higher standard. We've already had the big action bonanza but watching Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the crew together on the big screen has been done and it's not enough to carry my interest this time around. The promotional materials made it out to be the darker, edgier sequel with repercussions to the heroes' actions and, though it might be clichéd, an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK vibe. Well, it came close but fell short. I still enjoyed AGE OF ULTRON but I walked out of the theater with a resigned shrug, muttering 'It was all right.' As the film opens, the Avengers are well established and in the midst of an assault on a Hydra base in the country of Slokovia. We're introduced to 'the twins', Hydra's genetically-enhanced ace up its sleeve: Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) Maximoff. Or, as comic fans know them, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Following their success in Slokovia and the reacquisition of Loki's scepter, Tony Stark gets the wild idea to incorporate the scepter's alien 'programming' into his proposed artificial intelligence program, Ultron, in hopes of creating an automated Earth defense. It works too well, and Ultron becomes sentient with plans of protecting the Earth in the most efficient means possible: eradicating its pesky human infestation.Once again, the Avengers biggest opponent is pacing. At nearly 2.5 hours, this is a big movie, packed to the brim with action and plot. The main issue I see is that since half of the characters aren't getting standalone movies (Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk) we're trying to cram their personal story elements into a movie that should be focused on the whole 'sentient robot intent on destroy human life' bit. Whereas the first movie ground to a halt following the assault on the Hellicarrier so the characters could mourn their loss and regroup for the final climactic battle, AGE OF ULTRON does the same with a stint at a 'safe house' where we show the human side to being part of a hero team. Interesting concept to be explored in a superhero film, but probably not the best time right now. You want to give a romantic subplot to Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff? Fine. Do it in a Hulk and/or Black Widow movie. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor each have their own film series to get the minutiae out of the way so that, when we get the band back together for a big show, we can incorporate elements of their individual struggles without stopping the main story thread to build on them further. When you've got this amount of bigger than life characters (and cast) sharing the screen, we need to be economical in how we spend that 2.5 hours. I mean, AGE OF ULTRON feels like it's equally part Hawkeye/Jeremy Renner apology for turning him into a mind-controlled zombie in the first film. We're treated to extra backstory for the character and he gets some extra time in the spotlight for action and zingers.I'm also a little tired of the big action spectacle finale. It was awesome in THE AVENGERS because it was our first time seeing all these major characters fighting side-by-side on the big screen. So sure, whatever, give me a half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless alien enemies. In the sequel, I expect a little more creativity. And what did we get? A half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless robot enemies. Look, I love watching the Avengers crush the villain and their faceless CG army as much as the next fan but I wouldn't mind changing things up a bit. These guys are more than fists. Let's get a problem for the Avengers that isn't easily resolved by smashing wave after wave of baddies. I absolutely loved the first half of this movie, where the Avengers are faced with an enemy they aren't prepared to encounter. Not Ultron (as much as I loved the character) but the Scarlet Witch. She gets into their heads and uses their fears and concerns against them, attacking them on an emotional level and sending them to whimper in the corner. Or, if you're the Hulk, rampaging through an unsuspecting downtown metropolis. Wanda/Scarlet Witch was an awesome addition to the character roster for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Olsen does a phenomenal job giving her a physicality to her 'spell-casting' and an innocence to counter her brother's angry freedom-fighter persona. I'm not 100% sold on her eastern European accent yet, but it's not distracting. Johnson's Quicksilver doesn't steal the spotlight as Evan Peters did in Fox's DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but he does a fine job with minimal material. Really, I think Quicksilver is only here because they wanted to bring in Scarlet Witch and figured it was a package deal. Another excellent addition is the Vision, who's involvement in the film is pretty important to the plot so I won't go into the how's and why's but I will say I was most excited to see him brought to the franchise. Very, very cool to bring in the Vision.AGE OF ULTRON isn't a bad movie but it doesn't rise above and beyond THE AVENGERS as I hoped it would. It's got some excellent material in there and some obvious fan service to get us cheering. It loses steam once we hit the safe house but you can tell they were trying to go bigger this time around. They still just working out the kinks.",7,2,7,27 March 2016
The Dark Knight," Simply Incredible and One of My All-Time Favorites...
","Christopher Nolan has created the greatest superhero film ever in the latest installment of his Batman franchise. While I didn't get involved in all the viral marketing for this film, I did follow the news on it very closely in the year preceding it's release. I had some ridiculously high hopes for the movie before it came to theaters and I was so happy when it not only lived up to the hype, but blew it away. Not only is film the greatest superhero film to date, it is easily one of my favorite movies ever. The movie continues the Batman saga with the mob losing it's stranglehold on Gotham City due to the actions of Batman, Lieutenant Jim Gordon, and the new district attorney, Harvey Dent. In an act of desperation, the mob turns to a relative newcomer who offers to handle their little Batman problem...the Joker.Seeing as how Nolan wanted to keep his Batman franchise grounded in reality, I was confused as to how he planned to do so with a character such as the Joker. And, I won't lie, I was a bit leery upon hearing of his casting Heath Ledger in the iconic role. Well, I've learned my lesson and I will not doubt the skills of Christopher Nolan again. Ledger was AMAZING in his portrayal of the villain...he wasn't the least bit campy and he came off as a sadistic, chaotic, genuine threat to Batman. He stole EVERY scene he was in and was almost charismatic in his lunacy. It's a shame Ledger was so good in his performance because he nearly outshines the other great performances in the film.Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman each reprise their roles from the first film and continue providing solid performances. Oldman (Gordon) was given a larger role in this film and it was cool watching his character grow into the powerful figure we're familiar with. There have been a lot of complaints regarding Maggie Gyllenhaal's replacement of Katie Holmes in the role of Rachel Dawes but I thought she did a fine, if not a little better than Holmes. Finally, the film introduces Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, who I feel should get more recognition for his performance. While Ledger was definitely the highlight of the cast, Eckhart had the challenge of portraying Dent through a crucial character arc and pulled it off with ease.Everything about this film was a dramatic improvement over an already amazing film. The action was bigger, the tone was darker, the characters/cast were incredible...I really couldn't find a single thing to dislike about this film. The running time was a full 2.5 hours but you really don't notice. From the opening scene, the film grabs you and doesn't let up until the end. I know not everyone agrees with my opinion, but so everyone I've watched it with does. Nolan has created a Batman film that the audience doesn't need to be comic book fans to appreciate.",10,7,16,28 December 2008
2001: A Space Odyssey," Absolutely Epic in Scope, Visually Stunning, and a Bit of a Rough Watch
","I've watched Stanley Kubrick's epic science fiction film for the first time within the last few days, and it certainly gets into your mind and sticks. I've found myself thinking about it often, pondering over the subtext of the film and seeing what conclusions I come to. Kubrick has created an abstract film where each viewer is left to their own devices to find meaning. It begins in the past, as an extraterrestrial monolith spurs our man-ape ancestors to use their first tool/weapon. Thousands of years later, as man begins exploration of the lunar surface, a second monolith is discovered. It beams a powerful radio signal to Jupiter, leading to the next phase of man's interstellar journey. A mission of the utmost secrecy is dispatched to Jupiter. Two astronauts (Keir Dullea and Gary Lockwood) attend to the ship's operations with the assistance of the advanced AI, HAL 9000 (voiced by Douglas Rain), with three scientists in hibernation. Complications arise when HAL, who appears to have evolved enough sentience to feel emotion, becomes paranoid of the astronauts intentions and turns on them. Those who complete the mission will be catapulted into the next stage of evolution.I've gone years hearing about how epic Kubrick's film was. I'd tried watching it once as a child, gotten about ten minutes into the 'Dawn of Man' sequence, and given up. It's certainly a rough watch for those with shortened attention spans. Kubrick fills his science fiction opera with long-winded scenes of slow-moving space vehicles drifting through their operations while classical music tinkers in the background. The dialogue is minimal and, with the exception of the Jupiter mission sequence with HAL and the astronauts, serves little purpose except to set the stage for the journey being undertaken. This isn't a commercial film meant to appeal to the masses. Kubrick has done what few others have successfully accomplished: used the film medium to create a piece of art. Images and music come together to tell a story of mankind's evolution and where it might eventually lead. The story is hardly the traditional three-act structure audiences are accustomed to, and the characters are barely developed. That's because it's not the characters that are important here, it's the human race as a whole and a vision of our next phase in the universe. The characters are merely tools in the story, and don't really carry it themselves.It's a trippy experience and I'm not so bold as to claim I fully understand it. The entire final act of the film is a fantastic mind-trip of color, sound, and psychedelic visuals leading to an odd conclusion in a glorious bedroom setting. I hope to avoid spilling too many details and urge those who are curious to watch it themselves, not that my descriptions will make the end any more clearer. Kubrick has stated that each audience member is to draw their own meaning from the film and I see it as being that humans must transcend their reliance on technology to achieve the next stage of evolution. The astronauts' confrontation with the similarly-evolved HAL 9000 seems to act as a final challenge to overcome this dependency, as well as their near-equal in evolutionary terms. The entire HAL sequence is my favorite part of the film and will probably remain one of the most memorable movie sequences ever (particularly the last bit as HAL sings 'Daisy'...it's so haunting...). As much as I want to share this film experience with friends, I'm aware it's not for everyone. Even with my intense interest in the film, I had a hard time sitting through some of the drawn-out sequences and the 2.5 hour run-time is pretty daunting. If you can manage it, it's worth watching because it can make for some fantastic conversation with other fans when it's all said and done.",8,1,5,17 January 2011
Toy Story," Pixar First Feature is an Instant Classic
","Pixar's long line of success began in 1993 with TOY STORY, the first in a series of highly successful CG family films. Pixar had the formula nailed from the start, creating a fun kid's film with a powerful story capable of entertaining adults. In the film, we're introduced to the world of Andy's room when no one's around and the toys come to life. Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is a classic cowboy doll complete with a pull-string vocal box and reigns as young Andy's favorite toy. For his birthday, Andy receives a flashy new Buzz Lightyear action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) and Woody must cope with the fact that he may have been bumped from the top position. A botched attempt at lodging Buzz behind Andy's desk throws Buzz out into the real world and Woody must bring him back to regain the trust of the other toys.The fun of this kid's film lies in the characters. Allen is hilarious as Buzz and his inability to grasp that he's merely a child's toy and not an actual space ranger, spending half the film trying to return to Star Command; Hanks is a bit neurotic and totally high strung as Woody in his role as the toy-in-charge (going so far as to hold meetings on plastic erosion and establishing a buddy-system for moving day). The room is loaded with great supporting characters in the form of classic playthings from everyone's childhoods: a Slinky dog, a Mr. Potato Head, a piggy bankÂ…each with their own unique personalities. These characters are each fun enough to deserve their own movie and we're lucky to have been given the TOY STORY sequels to return to this world.I really enjoy the film overall (as do just about everyone I know who's seen it) and there is little to complain about. It's amazing to see how well the animation stands up after so many years. You can see that the computer graphics aren't as smooth as modern CG, but it's still near seamless. Pixar's first film is a classic I was happy to introduce to my daughter.",8,0,0,10 August 2010
Men in Black," A Perfect Blend of Sci-Fi, Comedy, Action, and Will Smith at his Blockbuster Best
","Whenever I'm in a movie discussion with friends and the topic drifts towards top comic book movies, I really need to remember to start including MEN IN BLACK. Released in 1997, I suppose you could say it was the first real mainstream Marvel comic adaptation (remember, BLADE wasn't released until 1998). To be honest, I wasn't even aware that it even was based on a Marvel comic until many years later. I guess the series was pretty short-lived, and the movie doesn't really do much to remain faithful to the source material. Still, a comic movie it is and it remains one of my favorites. It's funny, there's some great action, and the effects continue to hold up well even now. The Men in Black are a top-secret government organization dedicated to monitoring and policing extraterrestrial activity on Earth. When his partner retires, Agent K (Jones) sees potential in NYPD officer James Edwards (Smith). He recruits Edwards and exposes him to the truth: aliens are out there and they just want to go about their lives. Well, most of them. Edwards, rechristened as Agent J, has got his work cut out for him on his first investigation. An interstellar bug has arrived on Earth with galaxy theft on his mind, and an Arquillian battle cruiser has settled into orbit with weapons powered and intent to destroy the planet if the MiB don't provide them with said galaxy. The problem is: where does one hide an entire galaxy in the city of New York? Agents J and K had better figure it out or they won't have long to regret it.MEN IN BLACK comes from a time when Will Smith was king of the summer blockbuster. He was at the top of his money making game, and MEN IN BLACK is one of his best summer action hits. MEN IN BLACK has all of the ingredients for a hit that continues to entertain long after it's left theaters. First and foremost, it's got a perfect blend of action, comedy, and science fiction. Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones have perfect chemistry, with Smith doing his usual routine (or what once was his usual routine) and Jones as his no-nonsense partner/mentor in the life of a MiB agent. The Smith/Jones partnership is the only factor that remained cool well into the sequel, despite everything else about it failing miserably. The creature effects in this movie are, somehow, better than both sequels combined. I imagine it's because it relies more on practical effects and makeup for the various alien creatures populating this world. Rick Baker's creature effects in MEN IN BLACK are fantastic. Mikey (the illegal alien), the worms, the Arquillian ambassadorthe practical effects are the best effects. From the moment I first saw the original MEN IN BLACK, I'd hoped it would become an ongoing franchise. In my defense, that was before I knew how they'd nearly kill the franchise with the garbage that was MEN IN BLACK II. But there is still potential in the franchise; MEN IN BLACK 3 was nowhere near the train-wreck I was expecting and I would love for the series to continue on with new agents and the right writer/director.What a new MEN IN BLACK will need that the second film forgot was a strong villain. The original movie had a great alien baddie: a giant cockroach crammed in the skin of a white trash human farmer named Edgar, as played by Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio was great, giving Edgar a host of bizarre ticks and stiff movements with a full-on hatred for humankind. Then there is Linda Fiorentino as local mortician Laurel Weaver, who's only really there for plot purposes. She's also supposed to fill the role of a possible love interest for Agent J, but nothing really comes of it and, come to think of it, she doesn't really do anything in the movie. I guess Weaver could be seen as the weakest link in the film. Weak love interest aside, the rest of the film is populated with appropriately weird faces to fill it out. Rip Torn is Zed, head of the MiB, and Tony Shalhoub is intergalactic arms dealer and local pawnbroker Jack Jeebs. MEN IN BLACK is still a lot of fun more than ten years since it was originally released. After having watched the original again after so many years and finding that I love it just as much as when I saw it the first time, I think the series is due for a reboot with new agents and new sci-fi craziness.",9,3,4,24 June 2013
Elysium," Neill Blomkamp's Second Film Fails to Reach DISTRICT 9 Levels
","DISTRICT 9 was one of the best surprises from 2009. A director I've never heard of creating one of the best science fiction films I've seen in recent history. It had phenomenal effects and production design, creating a world in which aliens existed and lived confined in slums, suffering hatred at the hands of an untrusting mankind. The movie provided a solid social commentary while entertaining and amazing the audience, leaving many (including myself) excited for director Neill Blomkamp's next film. After four long years, Blomkamp returned with his sophomore effort, ELYSIUM. It contained many of the same elements as DISTRICT 9: social commentary, science fiction with a less than stellar future, special effects that feel embedded in the real world. But ELYSIUM isn't on the same level as DISTRICT 9. I wish I could say it had exceeded its predecessor, but no. It fell a bit short. The plot: in the year 2154, humans have divided into two separate societies. The Earth has fallen victim to disease, overpopulation, and pollution and it's driven the richest of our species to create an orbital space station. This utopia, named Elysium, is a perfect society where only the most wealthy are allowed to dwell. The rest of us, the lower class, are relegated to the Earth's surface to live in hovels and do the dirty jobs. Max (Matt Damon) is a former felon living in Los Angeles when he's injured in an industrial accident. He absorbs a lethal dose of radiation and he's told he has five days to live. He knows Elysium has advanced medical facilities that could cure him in minutes and agrees to join an information heist in exchange for a ticket on the next refugee ship to the station. The heist goes wrong and Max goes on the run with a world-changing computer program downloaded into his brain, while a psychotic commando gives chase on orders from a high-ranking Elysium official hoping to wrestle control of the station from the existing president with the contents of Max's mind.First, the good. ELYSIUM is an entertaining movie. It's still got the fantastic production design that made DISTRICT 9 such an amazing world. The special effects in this film are on par, if not a little better, than Blomkamp's first, and there's a boatload more this time around. The orbital paradise of Elysium is a wicked sight. It's designed as a ring structure with the inhabitants living on the interior rim, using the station's rotation to create an artificial gravity. The people live in one giant super-rich neighborhood with giant mansions scattered across the landscape and robots doing anything resembling work. Earth (or at least Los Angeles, where a portion of the film is set) is a barren landscape with people living in hovels piled on hovels and fighting for what meager resources are available. The volatile population is kept in line with a series of robots used as brutal law enforcement. It's got a little MAD MAX vibe with familiar vehicles being outfitted with armor and weapons for the heist sequence. It's a dirty, miserable environment and the total opposite of what we see in Elysium. Overall, ELYSIUM is a beautiful movie. The CG is also used to give the violence in the movie some extra punch. If you remember the action in DISTRICT 9, there was some bloody violence in that film. Alien weapons would detonate their targets and leaving a bloody smear on the wall. It's no different here. ELYSIUM earns it's R-rating with some brutal violence (including one particularly awesome moment with a grenade and someone's face). Dishing out a good chunk of the violence is one of the film's other best elements: Sharlto Copley as Kruger, the force of violent insanity chasing our hero. I've enjoyed Copley in both DISTRICT 9 and THE A-TEAM but his turn as a villain is just plain cool. Copley can do crazy well and, as Kruger, he's at his craziest. He's a raging ball of murder, barely controlled by Jodie Foster's Delacourt.And there's my first of two complaints about ELYSIUM. Jodie Foster isweirdin this movie. She's really phoning it in here. She grandstands through her role as the evil whatever she is. Seriously, I'm not quite sure what her role on Elysium is. Some sort of head of Homeland Security or something, I think, who's at odds with her superiors for using Kruger to blow up refugee spacecraft from Earth. And she's using some bizarre accent for her character. It's not quite European but I can't figure out what it's supposed to be. A minor misstep, but still a distraction. Finally, my biggest complaint with the movie is the social commentary. Yes, the same thing I was just praising DISTRICT 9 for is a complaint about ELYSIUM. Because this movie continually slaps you in the face with it. There's no subtlety here. It's all right there, shoved in your face. There's more than enough to reinforce the theme of the rich oppressing the poor, and there's plenty to compare the plight of the Earthbound humans trying to find a better life on Elysium to America's current immigration issues. ELYSIUM just feels a little too 'on-the-nose' with it's social themes and I miss DISTRICT 9 where it's themes were a canvas on which the plot was painted as opposed to the entirety of the movie.It's not enough to ruin the movie for me. I enjoyed ELYSIUM. It may not be all that memorable once it's over but it's a good time while you're watching it. Cool action, Copley's killer Kruger, fantastic production value, and a real basic story that doesn't require much thought. I would've like something a little more on par with DISTRICT 9 but I'm not about to rule Blomkamp out yet. The man's got vision and a love for science fiction, so I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.",7,0,1,3 May 2014
This Is Spinal Tap," The Best Band to Have Never Existed
","I'm going to avoid making the obligatory 'goes to 11' joke in this comment, hehe...This movie has become a comedy classic. The film is a mockumentary about the worst (greatest?) heavy metal band to have never existed: Spinal Tap. My friend introduced me to the film when he discovered I'd never seen it, immediately demanding I give it a viewing. I'm glad he did, as this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The entire film is played as a real documentary as it follows the band on tour in America to promote a new album and we get a glimpse into the small minds of the band.The movie is directed by Rob Reiner, who also has a part in the movie as documentarian and Spinal Tap fan, Marty DiBergi. The band's key members are the comedy team of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer. These guys were AMAZING; most of the movie was filmed unscripted with improvised lines and these guys were hilarious (for further proof, listen to the character commentary on the special edition DVD). In addition to the humor, the film also has some pretty addicting music. The film's stars all played their own instruments and did their own vocals, and they sound great. I can't tell you how long I had 'Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight' stuck in my head after watching this film.I can understand how people became confused and believed Spinal Tap to be a real bad; it almost had me believing it until I realized the lead singer was Michael McKean. The film is played completely straight-faced and that only makes it funnier when the band encounters a myriad of problems on the road; the scene backstage when Nigel is discussing his food selections with Ian Faith (the manager, Tony Hendra) is hilarious. Those who haven't yet seen Reiner's film are missing out on this cult classic.Watching this film again, I really wish the three actors would get together for a little reunion tour....",8,0,3,3 March 2009
Alice in Wonderland," On the Frabjous Day, He Will Futterwacken Vigarously...
","Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 and has suffered from strange dreams for half her life. She's an intelligent girl with little interest in the strict rules and etiquette of Victorian England; her unconventional thoughts bring disdain from those around her. She's expected to marry an arrogant British lord and she's unhappy with the direction her life is heading. On the afternoon of her engagement party, she runs off after a white rabbit and, after a short trip down a rabbit hole, finds herself in Underland. She discovers from the strange inhabitants that the land is under the tyrannical rule of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and it is believed she is the 'Alice' destined to defeat the Queen's Jabberwocky and bring freedom from her reign.All right, just to clarify, I've never read any of Lewis Carroll's original stories and I've had minimal exposure to Disney's 1951 animated film. Still, seeing as how I haven't spent my life under a rock, I know enough of the basics. As I understand, 2010's ALICE is a sequel of sorts, not a reboot and reimagining of the original story. The story's not bad, I suppose. I was digging the movie for the first hour or so, as Alice wanders through Underland and we're introduced to the interesting characters scattered throughout. That's about all that kept me interested, the characters and world design, since the story itself was pretty thin.The casting for the film was fantastic, though some of them have been staples of Burton films and were a given. Most people speak of Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter; Depp does a great job but we all know he can play the weirdest of characters. This wasn't really a stretch for him and, after having seen his performance here, I'm itching to see him in a serious role again. Carter was fun as the Red Queen with her mega-cranium and her obsession with lopping off heads of anyone who so much as looks at her wrong. Crispin Glover was probably my favorite in the film (and almost unrecognizable) as Stayne, the knave of hearts who's flirtations with the Queen keep him in her good graces. We also run the full gamut of full-CG characters, from the hilariously manic March Hare to Absolem the hookah-smoking caterpillar (voiced by the awesome Alan Rickman, who almost seemed to be disinterestedly phoning in his performance here).Despite what everyone around me seems to claim, this is nowhere near Tim Burton's best film. Sure, it's amazing to look at; the characters are beautifully designed (I can't stop staring at the oddness that are the Tweedles...) and the landscape is equal parts twisted and beautiful. Unfortunately for the film, that's all it is. It's an enjoyable watch but it feels empty at the end. It doesn't help that, after all the strange and colorful interactions that fill the film, it ends with an action sequence. It totally weakened the last half hour and I lost interest at that point, and the CG for the Jabberwocky was the only CG in the film that stood out (in a bad way).Be warned: you should be prepared to watch the film in subtitles. Between the gibberish of the Underland language and Depp's tendency to slip into a thick Scottish brogue during the Hatter's moments of angry lucidity, there were some parts I just couldn't understand watching in theaters without the aid of subtitles to help (most of) it make more sense.",6,0,2,9 July 2010
Avatar," Cameron's Latest Epic a Visual Feast
","Here is a movie on which it seems everyone has a strong opinion. It is the highest grossing movie in history, taking in almost $3 billion around the world, and it revolutionized the industry (for better or worse) by showing that 3D could be a profitable new element in cinema. James Cameron is one of my favorite all-time directors and is no stranger to creating ground-breaking special effects (e.g. TERMINATOR 2). He may not be the strongest writer, but he knows how to bring a story to life better than most. AVATAR is set in a distant future where a corporation has discovered a large deposit of the valuable element 'unobtainium' on a moon called Pandora. The environment is hostile, the wildlife vicious, and the atmosphere poisonous. As if that wasn't enough, the mining is inhibited by Pandora's indigenous, a species called the Na'vi. In an attempt to interact with the Na'vi, the Avatar program was created in which a person is jacked into a specially-grown human/Na'vi hybrid. Paraplegic Marine Jake Sully is recruited into the program to fill the Avatar left by his dead brother and, upon finding himself lost in the Pandora wilderness, is cautiously accepted into a Na'vi tribe where he learns their life and customs. As the humans grow closer to moving the Na'vi out of the way by force, Jake is torn between his obligation to the mission and his love for the beautiful Neytiri and her people.Cameron is a fantastic visionary. He literally brings the alien world of Pandora to life, meticulously creating an entirely new ecosystem and culture for this film. I'll admit, I am a huge fan of Cameron's but the trailers for this film did nothing to interest me. If my friend hadn't been interested in seeing the film, I probably would've missed out. Instead, I saw the film in 3D IMAX and my mind was blown at the epic effects Cameron brought to the screen. Once I was exposed to Pandora, my mind never once dropped out of the film and remembered I was watching an entire CG world. It was beautifully seamless. Still, I was not one of those viewers who saw the film and became clinically depressed when it was over. It was good, but it wasn't that good. As you've probably read in countless other reviews and comments on the film, it's far from original. It's the same story you've seen before in DANCES WITH WOLVES or THE LAST SAMURAI, but it's Cameron's spin on the tale and he was sure to include his 'green' message about the importance of the environment and the evils of technology. Absolutely entertaining, but nothing that'll leave you breathless.Sam Worthington is Jake Sully, and I suppose he did a decent enough job. He's not an amazing actor (in my opinion, but I've only seen him in two films and neither required a whole lot from him) but it's not hard to mess up the role of a disillusioned Marine grunt. He's only required to act somber with the occasional impassioned moment when he's rallying the Na'vi to join him in battle or falling for Neytiri. Zoe Saldana, on the other hand, is freakin' great. She does an amazing job here and it's even more impressive when you consider that her character was entirely CGI and created with motion capture. The same kudos can be extended to CCH Pounder, Laz Alonso, etc for creating powerful emotion through what essentially boils down to million dollar cartoons. Stephen Lang is my favorite performance in the movie as the hard-boiled Colonel Quatrich, head of security for the humans on Pandora. He's a stone-cold soldier and isn't afraid to storm into the heat of battle. Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, and Joel Moore round out a strong supporting cast.The writing is weak (unobtainium?) but the visuals are beautiful and the cast turn in some good performances. It's not the best of 2009 but I believe it still shows Cameron hasn't lost his touch. I guess we'll have to wait and see how the sequels turn out.",8,2,4,17 May 2011
Toy Story 2," TOY STORY 2 Even Better Than the First
","Pixar raised the standard for feature film animation with their wildly successful TOY STORY in 1995. It was a fun adventure for the kids that was so well done that adults could enjoy it with them. Sequels are notorious for failing to live up to the original (with obvious exceptions) and TOY STORY 2 could've easily ended up as a direct-to-DVD throwaway in an attempt to cash in on the success of the original. Instead, I felt it surpassed the quality of the first and brought even more to the table. The film follows Woody as the begins to sink in that toys don't last forever. His arm is torn and Woody is shelved, a seeming death sentence for toys. In an attempt to rescue a fellow broken toy from being sold at a yard sale, Woody is stolen by an obsessed collector who wishes to complete his 'Woody's Round-Up' collection for sale to a Japanese museum. Upon arriving at the collector's apartment, Woody meets the other members of his round-up gang (Jessie, his loyal horse Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector) and it's revealed that Woody is actually a collector's item spawned from a popular kid's television show of the 50s. As Buzz Lightyear assembles the rest of Andy's toys to mount a rescue operation, Woody must make a decision: immortal glory as part of a museum exhibit or the temporary love of his owner Andy.All of our favorite toys from the first film return with the original voice cast, with a few new additions. Estelle Harris (George Costanza's mom on SEINFELD) is Mrs. Potato Head and Joan Cusack is Jessie; both have some hilarious moments and fit right in with the originals. While Woody and Buzz are the stars, my favorite characters have always been the supporting players: Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), and Rex (Wallace Shawn). We get plenty of them as they accompany Buzz on the mission and their romp through a toy store is just great. Despite the awesomeness of the toy cast, one of my favorite characters is toy collector Al (Wayne Knight). Knight is great as the spastic money-grubbing baddie who's finally gotten the final piece to his cash cow.The movie felt more action-oriented than the first. The first TOY STORY had its moments but this film ups the ante with the toys crossing a dangerously busy four-lane road, a twisting chase through a cavernous airline baggage sorter, and an eventual chase over the tarmac to reach a plane. While it is a kid's movie by nature, it's still a fun movie to people of any age thanks to the characters and a universal love of our childhood playthings. The story was well written and Woody's dilemma over his mortality as a toy is an interesting followup to Buzz's moment of depressing recognition that he was indeed just a toy in the first film. Overall, a great family film and easy to recommend to anyone.",9,0,1,9 December 2010
Frank," FRANK is a Lot of Fun; Fassbender is Awesome!
","When big budget mainstream movies wear me out, I turn to the film festivals to find a good character-driven, small-scale film to detox. In 2014, one movie that seemed to receive a lot of positive chatter was FRANK. I'd known very little about it but the image of the giant plaster head stuck with me and the buzz was enough to intrigue into a blind-buy when it finally arrived on store shelves. Man, I'm glad I did because I love this movie. It's a bizarre little character-driven tale of aspiring singer/songwriter Jon Burroughs (Domhnall Gleeson) who, when we first meet him, trapped in a dead-end world of office work and a life in suburbia. A chance encounter leads him to a seemingly one-time gig with a small-time band called the Soronprfbs, headed by a mysterious figure that wears a giant plaster head and goes only by the name Frank. The gig is a disaster but the band still needs a new keyboardist (their last tried to drown himself in the ocean), and Frank saw something charming about Jon. Jon is invited to join Soronprfbs as they gather to cut their first album and it's not long before he realizes he's gone off the deep end. The other band members resent him from the start, particularly Clara (Maggie Gyllenhaal. Clara is the band's Theremin player and the closest to Frank; she's short-tempered and violent, and Jon is immediately on her bad side. There are dueling ideologies as Jon is determined to find commercial success and the Soronprfbs just want to be themselves, and Frank is caught in the middle.It would've been cool if the movie had made a point of keeping Frank's identity secret in the promotional materials and left it as a surprise for the movie's finale, but the posters and video cover art prominently advertise the fact that Frank is played by Michael Fassbender. This is, no doubt, my favorite Fassbender performance. Frank is an interesting individual. He wears the head 24/7; shower, sleep, mealsthe head is always on. Working behind the mask meant Fassbender had to give a broad physical performance as well to really bring Frank to life. And then there's the character behind the mask. Frank is unnaturally kind and he's got a talent for pulling music, however bizarre, out of the air. I thought he had a hint of Jim Morrison in his lyrics, with songs that sound as if they could've come from one of Morrison's poems (minus the extreme sexual themes). He's the one person in the band who seems genuinely thrilled to have Jon on board, and it drives Clara insane. Clara sees how Jon's presence is changing the course of the band and she doesn't like it. As the band struggles to put an album together in a remote Irish cabin, Jon is quietly recording video of the strange proceedings and posting them to YouTube to draw an audience and build a fan base. All Frank hears is that Jon has created a legion of fans for the band, but the rest of the crew can see Jon muscling into a place in the spotlight.As fun as it is seeing Fassbender in action as his coolest character ever, the movie is more about that power struggle. Jon starts of innocent enough. He's just excited to finally have found a band. But he's the type who wants superstardom with legions of screaming fans, whereas the Soronprfbs just want people who dig their music. Or not. Honestly, the only one who seems to care whether people like their music is Frank. But even then, I think he just loves the idea that people 'get' them. It all comes to a head in Austin, TX when Jon manages to score the band a position at SXSW based on their Internet popularity. It's a fun train wreck to witness as tensions hit their peak and Jon's dream falls apart. But, as interesting as the plight of Soronprfbs is, the best part of the film is the end where we learn who Frank truly is and Jon comes to terms with his own musical core. It's a great reveal and the film's best song closes out the movie. The first song from the band that we get to hear in full, 'I Love You All' is weird and haunting and, as soon as I heard it, I couldn't get it out of my head. Needless to say, I downloaded it to my phone. I wouldn't be surprised if FRANK becomes a cult classic; Fassbender is a riot, the music gets into your head, and the, if you're like me, you'll want to watch it all again.",9,0,1,1 August 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Raimi's Triumphant Return to Horror
","After the disappointment that was SPIDER-MAN 3, I was glad to see Sam Raimi taking a break from the web-slinger saga to return to what helped make him famous: campy B-grade horror. Here, he has total creative control and as a result we're given one of the most fun horror movies I've seen in recent years. Without relying heavily on gore effects, the film manages to send a chill down your spine while at the same time making you laugh at some great camp moments. The premise is simple: Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer who refuses an extension to an old woman on the verge of losing her home. The old woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), just so happens to be a gypsy who doesn't take the news so well and places the curse of the Lamia on Christine, leaving her three days to find a way to rid herself of the curse or her soul will be dragged to Hell.Keep in mind, I said the movies doesn't rely on gore but it does have it's share. Regrettably some of the gore is blatant CGI (the anvil moment) but it adds to the camp and doesn't hurt the movie. You can tell Raimi tried to rely on practical effects, only resorting to CGI when he had no other option. My absolute favorite moment in the movie is the goat in the séance (a bit of good old-fashioned animatronics) which always seems to get a laugh. Over the course of the movie, you'll see Raimi hasn't lost his EVIL DEAD touch.As for the cast, Lohman was a perfect choice for the role of Christine. She plays the character as so innocent and pure, a victim of circumstance who would've helped Ganush if she weren't so worried about a possible promotion. She creates a soft-spoken country girl in extreme circumstances (receiving more than her fair share of stomach-churning punishment) who's easy to feel for. Just as talented is Raver as the Ganush; while her screen time isn't as much, she manages to leave an impression as one of the creepiest old women I've ever seen in horror. Rounding out the cast are Justin Long (mildly amusing though hard to accept in a role as a college professor) and relative newcomer Dileep Rao as Rham Jhas, Christine's spiritual adviser throughout her dilemma.To sum it up, the movies comes off to me as equal parts creepy and funny and is a fun 90 minutes. For those who miss the over-the-top horror movies of the 80's, this'll be right up your alley.",8,1,3,24 October 2009
The Artist," An Amazing Homage to Old Hollywood
","When I was in college, I tried to convince my friends to come together and do a silent, black and white short film project as a little homage and a bit of fun. I was shot down repeatedly and told that no one shared my interest in the classic style, and I'm so glad that THE ARTIST came along and proved them wrong in a big way. As I'm sure you're already aware, THE ARTIST is a silent film and presented in black and white, going so far as to include the piano music we expect with your usual silent film. THE ARTIST is a great movie and I was excited to see it garner so much attention (and a crap load of awards including the Academy Award for Best Picture). It's nice to see that a movie that could be considered the polar opposite of mainstream in any real sense would be so popular. The film is set in Hollywood in the late 20's and early 30's when silent film was at it's peak and the introduction of talking pictures was on the rise. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is cinema's top leading man, a class act with his trusty dog. Valentin is the most beloved actor of his time, but when talking pictures become the next big sensation, George finds it all a little far-fetched and decides against joining the fad. When talking pictures leave silent film in their dust, Valentin's star dims and the world obsesses with Peppy Miller, a beautiful and charismatic young dancer who made her big break as an extra in a Valentin film.THE ARTIST is a wonderful film in a myriad of ways. It's a true homage to a style of filmmaking that's been gone for decades. Most people probably haven't even seen a silent film, and I know I've encountered a dozen or so people who won't even watch a black and white film because it's 'old' or 'boring'. THE ARTIST and all of it's awards/attention might be enough to get people who wouldn't otherwise give a silent film their time the motivation to give it a chance. This is a beautiful film, no doubt about it. It glitters and shines like you'd expect from an old school Hollywood spectacle back when it had class. You can't help but smile as you watch the film because the characters are so charming and the fun is contagious. This is an ultimate feel-good movie, even when it reaches its darkest point. Director Michel Hazanavicius has created a glimpse into Hollywood bright and shining history. The stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo (whom I didn't even recognize as the lady-in- waiting from A KNIGHT'S TALEman, she's come a long way), are fantastic. Dujardin is charismatic and fun, you are drawn into his struggle when he becomes Hollywood's old news. Silent films are out, and Valentin is too stubborn and set in his ways to change. His replacement, Peppy Miller (Bejo) is everything you'd want in a Hollywood starlet. She's beautiful, perpetually happy, with big eyes and an infectious smile. Plus, she's got talent. She quickly rises through the ranks to the top of the movie scene, where a dejected Valentin can only watch with regret.While THE ARTIST is a pretty amazing movie, it's not without a few minor flaws. Really, my only complaint with the film was that it did feel its lengths at times. Towards the middle of the film when Valentin's downward slide is nearing it's conclusion and the stage is being set for his eventual revival, it feels a little long but not unbearable. You just become eager to see the next phase of his struggle. And one minor, albeit aggravating complaint, on my part: why is Malcolm McDowell given billing on the home video and marketing materials when he is literally in the movie for a minute? Seriously, I was excited at the prospect of McDowell in the film but he has a brief cameo assupposedly a butlerI'm not sure. He's just sort of sitting in on an extra's casting session. He's there and then he's gone. Still, the movie boasts an impressive supporting cast with James Cromwell and John Goodman, both putting in great performances. There is a lot to love about this film and I'm sure it deserves plenty of recognition but I'm sure that there are some out there that will say it's only being held in high regard because it's the first silent film in years and it panders to old Hollywood. That might be the case, but I couldn't care less as it's a really enjoyable film.",9,2,3,16 October 2012
Mission: Impossible," Update of '60s TV Show Convoluted w/Great Action Scenes
","I was one of the many people who were completely baffled upon first watching this movie, but I didn't let it deter me. Future viewings helped clear up what I hadn't grasped the first time and it's now safe to say that Brian De Palma's update of the 1960's television series makes for one of my favorite spy flicks. Based on the popular TV show, the film follows a team of IMF (Impossible Mission Force) agents as they pursue a renegade official attempting to sell vital information. Soon, the IMF is dead and the surviving member, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), is accused of being a traitor. Now Hunt must hunt down the true traitor while attempting to capture the black market information broker.Even trying to give a synopsis was enough to confuse myself. As I stated, there is enough double-crossing and false leads in this film to confuse the average viewer the first time through. Even if you find yourself having trouble following the convoluted plot, there are enough fantastic action sequences to keep the film entertaining. From the botched mission that results in the deaths of Hunt's IMF team to the theft of the information from a high-tech CIA vault, there are some seriously great suspense/action moments.This film helped me become a fan of Tom Cruise. I hadn't seen much of his 80's films before and I'd never paid him much attention, but I thought he did a great job as Hunt. Following the deaths of his teammates, he reforms with a group of disavowed agents consisting of two awesome actors that outshine Cruise (in my opinion), Ving Rhames and Jean Reno. Toss in Jon Voight as IMF team leader Jim Phelps (the only character of the TV show to transition to the film) and the gorgeous, soft-spoken Emmanuelle Beart as his wife Claire, and you have a great cast rounding out this busy popcorn flick.",8,3,5,6 June 2009
Super 8," A Spielbergian Adventure from His Biggest Fan
","I stopped caring so much about SUPER 8 some time before it ever came to theaters. It wasn't that I didn't expect great things from J.J. Abrams. I know he's good for a fun movie, but the trailers never really grabbed my attention. Sure the teaser was interesting, with the 'mystery' bursting out from behind the sealed door of an Air Force train car. But it wasn't hard to guess what was coming out from behind that door; combine the mystery-less mystery with the fact that I don't have the same nostalgia for Steven Spielberg's 80's films, and SUPER 8 was destined not to have the same impact on me as it had on many others. The film is about a group of children in the late 70's putting together a zombie movie on super 8mm film for a local film festival. Joe (Joel Courtney) lost his mother to an industrial accident four months earlier, and tensions rise when he directing friend invites Alice Dainard (Ellie Fanning) to act in his film. Alice is the daughter of the man believed responsible for the death of Joe's mom and, despite this awkward tension that exists between their two fathers, emotions begin to develop between the two of them. Oh, and the town is terrorized by a mysterious creature of unknown origin. It's more of a B-story, despite what original trailers insinuated. While filming a scene for their zombie film, the friends witness a train derailment that releases the creature into their small town and eventually become involved in their own investigation.This movie really is about the kids first, and the creature second. That's fine, I guess. I just wish the filmmakers' early marketing efforts hadn't been about the beast's escape from the Air Force cargo train. Once the full trailer was released and I saw the actual scope of the movie, my interested began to fade. I was still interested in seeing it, but I wasn't in any rush. I normally hate children actors (some leftover resentment for Jake Lloyd's performance in STAR WARS EPISODE I, I suppose), but there are occasions where a child performer/cast will come along that makes me eat my words. This is one of them. It could just be proof of J.J. Abrams skill as a director that he's able to utilize kids so well, but the stars of this movie do a pretty excellent job (some more than others). You would never guess this is Joel Courtney's first feature role, and Riley Griffiths proves to be more than comfortable in front of the camera (even if he can be annoying at timesproduction value!!). The real strength in the group is Ellie Fanning as Alice Dainard. It must be something in the Fanning blood, but apparently they make fantastic child actors. She's got emotional power in her performance that stands out amongst her lesser castmates, and it's obvious she's going to have a successful future just as her sister had.This movie just didn't click with me. I was born in the 80's, so I wasn't really old enough to appreciate the Spielberg films that Abrams is goings nuts over here. I was too young for CLOSE ENCOUNTERS and, even as a kid, I never cared for E.T. I didn't see the Spielberg-produced GOONIES until years later (loved it though). So the homage that makes up the core of Abram's SUPER 8 just didn't resonate with me. I still enjoyed SUPER 8, quite a bit. It's just not what I'd spent months anticipating after seeing the teaser trailer. I wanted another good sci-fi movie, not a coming-of-age drama that just so happened to feature an alien plot. It's an incredibly well-done movie and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it, but I guess my lingering disappointment has given me a slight bias. It looks and feels like a mid-80s era Spielberg family/adventure film and, in that respect, Abrams nailed it. It just failed to really stay with me after leaving the theater and when I tried thinking back to the best movies I saw over the summer of 2011, despite how good this movie was, I'd completely forgotten about it. It was a fun sci-fi adventure with a great heart, and the final act of the film where the entire creature storyline kicks into gear is fun. I'm just glad Abrams got it out of his system so we can move on to STAR TREK 2 or whatever new project he's got up his sleeve.",8,1,4,10 January 2012
Sinister," Sinister Vibes Save This Film from Bouts of Boredom
","I took a chance with SINISTER because the trailers reminded me a bit of INSIDIOUS (one of the better recent horror movies) and because the initial reviews were curiously positive. Ethan Hawke is a talented actor and the trailer was pretty creepy. I would love to say it met my expectations and, at first, I suppose it did. My first viewing left me a nice creepy vibe but future viewings left me feeling a little bored. Not just because I knew the story and the final plot 'twist'. I knew that before I ever sat down to watch the movie because of some careless reviewers. After some thought, I realized it was because SINISTER is pretty drawn out. Writer/director Scott Derrickson and cinematographer Chris Norr have mastered creating a (no pun intended) sinister atmosphere but the movie suffers from a weak script. The movie is about a true crime novelist, Ellison Oswalt (Hawke), who moves his family into the home of a family that was brutally murdered under mysterious circumstances. Ellison uses the environment of the home to help inspire his writing while keeping his wife and kids oblivious to the fate of the home's previous tenants. He believes he's hit the mother-load when he discovers a box of old 8mm home movies in the attic. To Ellison's surprise, these are more than your average home video footagethey're a series of snuff films detailing the gruesome murders of five families. Ellison becomes obsessed with his study of the films, eager to find a missing clue as to the person behind these acts, and he uncovers a terrifying secretthat was sort of ruined in the trailers anyway.SINISTER is a fun enough movie the first time you watch it. Even knowing the big reveal at the end, Derrickson and Norr have put together one of the creepiest movies I've seen. Most of the credit really goes to the film's music. Seriously, SINISTER has the eeriest soundtrack: part music, part ambient sound, and totally chillingespecially when paired with near total silence and the click of an 8mm projector. The snuff films are the scariest part of the film. I suppose that should go without saying. Anyway, the snuff films in this movie are done incredibly well. When combined with the minimalist soundtrack, the films (shot in actual 8mm) are haunting. SINISTER jumps right in from the very beginning with one of it's most powerful images: a family of four stand beneath a massive tree with hoods over their faces and nooses around their necks while an unseen force slowly saws away at a mammoth tree branch on the other side. Once that branch is loosed, the counterweight lifts the family off their feet and we watch them kick and struggle for a minute before finally going still. It's incredibly effective and sets the tone of the movie perfectly. The rest of the snuff films are at least as effective and give the movie its most unsettling moments. It's just a shame the rest of the movie doesn't really keep that vibe alive.The real problem with SINISTER is how it bounces between horror/thriller and mystery. The horror elements, for the most part, do their job well. The mystery elements, not so much. A lot of the film is Ethan Hawke's Ellison as he investigates the snuff films and slowly pieces together the bigger picture. Unfortunately for SINISTER, that's where the movie starts to lose momentum. After we've seen the snuff films a few times, the effect diminishes a bit and all we're left with is Ellison playing detective. This mostly consists of Ellison being awoken in the middle of the night, experiencing something creepy, then waking up the next morning and watching the movies again with a bottle of booze and a notepad. Once you go through the cycle a few times, you just want the movie to move on to the next bit of scares. The whole supernatural element (effectively ruined in the trailers with Vincent D'Onofrio giving us the exposition via Skype) arrives in full about halfway through the movie and comes to a climax well past the point where I stopped caring. The ending is a little too predictable and might be determined well in advance by some viewers, but it plays out pretty nicely in the final 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. Ethan Hawke is great despite the little he has to work with, but his supporting cast drop the ball. Juliet Rylance is a little tooemotive. I know it's weird to claim an actress too emotive, seeing as how creating emotion is the name of their game. She doesn't quite ham it up but she comes on a little too strong. Either too happy or too angry, never quite right for the scene. Her performances reminds me of something from TV family drama; it doesn't fit well here. Ellison's kids don't get much to do, so that leaves our only other supporting cast as James Ransone as Deputy So-n-So. The deputy avoids the usual pitfall as a cop in a horror film by maintaining a good head on his shoulders. He actually becomes Ellison's voice of reason once the weirdness goes to the good author's head. Still, the deputy is mostly around to advance the story with new discoveries and guide us to the final haunting sequence.SINISTER is not a 'great' movie but it does deserve the chance to work its creepiness on you. When you watch this movie, in an effort to get the most from the experience, watch it in a dim room with minimal background noise. Let it establish it's atmosphere and draw you in. It's good for some chills and maybe a jump scare or two. Outside of that, SINISTER might find itself doomed to be forgotten as a movie in the dreaded category of 'not bad, but not great.'",7,1,2,2 June 2013
A Clockwork Orange," Viddy Well, Little Brother. Viddy Well...
","Stanley Kubrick was a masterful filmmaker, and one of the few directors I feel can rightfully claim such a title. The man was responsible for some of the most influential pieces of cinema and, of all his films, this is my favorite. The tale of Alex (Malcolm McDowell), a boy obsessed with the darker side of life. He spends his evenings committing acts of rape and indulging in a bit of ultra-violence with his droogs. He's intelligent, manipulative, and completely without remorse, and his luck is about to run out. After a routine break-in ends in murder, Alex is betrayed by his droogs and left to the police. He's sentenced to fourteen years in prison but finds a means of lessening his sentence if he agrees to partake in an experimental treatment to remove his violent tendencies. The treatment works and Alex is thrown back into a society to face those he's wronged. Alex's punishments are far from over as he confronts a society in which there is no place for him, and the aggressor becomes the victim.This movie would have been no where near as engaging if it weren't for Malcolm McDowell as Alex. The man is fantastic and still manages to come across as one of the most charismatic faces of evil in cinema. We watch as he engages in horrific acts of violence, and yet he manages to charm the audience into sympathizing with him through his narration. It's a wonder how McDowell didn't become one of the powerhouse actors of his generation following his incredible performance here. And, honestly, he's not alone. Every person in this film does a fantastic job in their part. My favorite supporting character would have to be Aubrey Morris as P.R. Deltoid, the corrections officer who oversees Alex. He adds some great humor to the film as he tries to warn Alex of the consequences he is facing and driving the point home with a punch to the groin. Patrick Magee is also great as Frank Alexander, one of Alex's victims who is driven to his limits after an assault on his home.I find this movie interesting because, unlike most mainstream films, the main character never appears to go through any real change. Sure, he's put through the torment of the experimental procedure but in the end he's the same old Alex. Apparently this was not as writer Anthony Burgess intended when he wrote the book upon which this film was based, but I can't see the film having the same effect if Kubrick took the same route. Burgess's message is lost in the film version but Kubrick has taken Burgess's material and made it his own in a new medium. Rather than promoting how each man must make their own choice whether to be good or evil, Kubrick seems to revel in basking in the corruption of this future society where the government is no better than the criminals. Many people have commented how they hate this film for it's exploitative violence and, yes, there is reason for some to be repulsed by it's content. Some will just find themselves confused at the nadset language developed by Burgess for this fictional world (not me, though...I loved it. I wish it were real) I'm certainly not one of this film's haters and I rank it as one of my top favorites.",10,1,4,25 January 2011
The Fly," One of the greatest sci-fi horrors ever...
","For me, this movie is a rare thing: a GOOD horror movie. It's not often that I find one. Yeah, there are some decent ones but the majority of the horror flicks I've seen can summed up in one word: lame. I've also noticed that a lot of my favorite horror movies were made before 1990. This one is definitely high on my list. David Cronenberg's 'The Fly' is a remake of the 1958 film starring Vincent Price.What sets this movie apart from the other horror flicks? Plot!! This movie has a wonderful story that doesn't just rely on 'Look out behind you!' scare tactics. Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brundle, an eccentric scientist on the verge of a great discovery: teleportation. When he firsts attempts at teleporting himself through, a fly makes it into the telepod with him and their genes are spliced together. Geena Davis is his love interest, playing a journalist who becomes interested in his work. Aside from the horror of this man's transformation into a monster, the movie has an emotional aspect of the characters' relationship and how it is tried by these tragic events. Davis's character is forced to watch the man she loves disappear.For those who hear that and are turning away because love is invading their scary movies, don't worry. While the special make-up and puppet effects may seem a little dated, it isn't enough to draw you out of the picture. The gore and transformation effects are definitely enough to gross you out. I recently showed this movie to my girlfriend for the first time and she could barely watch it.This is horror with heart! A magnificent combination that I wish we would see more of in modern movies...",8,0,1,4 February 2006
Limitless," High Potential Film but Ultimately Feels Directionless
","I was tempted to give this film a higher rating because I do think it's better than your average flick. It's a decent thriller but I think my problem is that I can't decide which of the handful of subplots is supposed to be our primary focus. The cast does a great job, but the story seems like it's being pulled in too many directions and, by the end, I'd didn't feel like I'd gotten a satisfying enough conclusion to any of them. Bradley Cooper (THE HANGOVER films, THE A-TEAM) is given a chance to headline his own film based on a novel from Irish author Alan Glynn. Cooper is an aspiring sci-fi writer who's hit rock bottom. He can't pay his rent and his girlfriend's leaving him. He's got a book contract, but he hasn't even brought himself to write a single word. Everything's looking down until his ex-brother-in-law shows up and introduces him to miracle designer drug NZT-48. Users begin to use their brain to the full potential and it's not long before Eddie Morra (Cooper) is using his new mental mastery to play the stock market and act as a consultant for a major business merger, but not without making a few enemies.LIMITLESS feels like a bunch of miniature related stories, all focused on the character of Eddie Morra, and all rolled into one film. There's Eddie's dependence on NZT-48. If he quits it outright, he'll die like others before him. There is Eddie's involvement in the Van Loon/Atwood merger. Then there's Eddie's failing relationship with his girlfriend Lindy and his involvement with Russian mobster Gennady, who has developed a taste of his own for NZT-48 and won't let Eddie cut him off. There's enough going on here that it probably could've been developed further into a possible television series. Instead he just bounces around between subplots until the end where everything is tied up loosely. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure which story was to be the primary and assumed it was his involvement with business mogul Carl Van Loon (Robert De Niro). The movie's trailers certainly seemed to paint it that way for me. Instead, the merger is just something going on in the background while Eddie deals with the ever-growing threat of Gennady (Andrew Howard) until the eventual confrontation. I would've preferred if the movie focused on Eddie's meteoric rise in the business world and how he struggles to maintain his new life while fighting to overcome the possibly fatal effects on NZT-48.I'm always a sucker for a good science fiction film, and LIMITLESS sort of falls into that category with the development of this wonder drug that unlocks your brain's potential. I'm pretty sure the belief that we only use 10% of our brains has been proved wrong already, but I was willing to ignore that since the movie's premise is so appealing. Who wouldn't want a pill that can jack your brain into overdrive, turning you into the ultimate success? I thought Cooper did a great job here, going from disorganized failure to man of the year. I wished De Niro would've had a larger role in the film, perhaps catching on to Cooper's secret early and trying to play it against him. Unfortunately, we get only a tiny bit of that in the final act of the film and it never really gets a chance to get off the ground. I've never read Glynn's 'The Dark Fields' on which this movie was based, but the movie's made me curious enough to pick it up in the future. There was a lot of potential in this movie and, while it was a fun movie, I just thought it didn't accomplish as much as it could've.",7,0,0,3 September 2011
Eyes Wide Shut," Sorry, I Just Don't Get It
","I'm a major fan of Stanley Kubrick's films, though I'm not always the greatest at dissecting them for the deepest content. Still, I can usually walk away with a good understanding of what Kubrick was trying to convey, but not here. For whatever reason, I couldn't see anything but the surface value of Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT. The film is about Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice (Nicole Kidman). Alice reveals to Bill that she once thought of having an affair and how she would've given up her entire life, her husband, her daughter, etc. for even one night with a passing Naval officer she'd seen. This news completely destroys Bill and he sets out into the streets of New York with visions of his wife in the arms of another man haunting his mind. Over the course of the night, he stumbles into a mysterious gathering in a secluded home where the halls are filled with people engaged in a ritualistic orgy. When Bill is discovered as an intruder and he believes a woman has been killed in order to protect him, he begins an his own investigation into what happened that night.Kubrick always seemed to have a much deeper meaning behind the surface story and I'm sure this film is no different. Many critics and fans have praised this film endlessly, so I'm sure there is more to it than meets the eye. I'm sorry to say I just don't get it. It seems to hint at a glimpse into jealousy and the power of sex (or lack thereof) in relationships. For me, all of this potential subtext is lost when I'm drawn into the mystery behind the strange cult/society Bill wanders into. For the remainder of the movie, I just wanted to see this plot-line pan out and fill in the answers and any subtext was overlooked. If you're a true Kubrick fan and haven't watched this film yet, I hope you won't let my own inability to understand it influence your decision in any way. This film has been hailed by some as a masterpiece and is still an intriguing, suspenseful drama.Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman do a fantastic job here, especially Kidman who's every line seems to drip with venom following their initial stoned confrontation over her once-desired infidelity. At the time of the film, the two were still married and I'm sure it contributed to their chemistry on-screen (well, maybe the awkwardness between the two sexually in the beginning or the animosity to come later). Again, Kubrick utilizes his masterful skills at creating atmosphere with his grainy footage, minimalist piano score, and colorful lighting. Despite the slow crawling pace of the film, it manages to remain engaging despite it's nearly three hour runtime. The ending was less than stellar and I felt it left a lot of loose ends, but again that's because my focus was on the mystery as opposed to the Harford's relationship. When the movie was over, it left me wanting answers but I still had the usual unease that seems to follow all of Kubrick's films. This film is probably best for true Kubrick fans and will leave the more casual fans a little underwhelmed.",6,3,7,14 February 2011
Sicario," Denis Villeneuve Scores Again with One of 2015's Best
","Denis Villeneuve continues to knock 'em dead with (in my opinion) his best film yet: SICARIO. I took interest in the man with his 2013 double-punch of PRISONERS and ENEMY (both of which are great films) but SICARIO was the only one I loved so much that I immediately texted a couple buddies and told them they need to watch. From the moment it started with the raid on a cartel stash house in an Arizona suburb, I was locked in and it never lost steam. I love this movie; it might be my favorite of 2015. Emily Blunt is FBI agent Kate Macer, a successful career woman who is given the opportunity to volunteer for an inter-agency operation that plans to go after some of the more powerful cartel heads. She's placed on a team run by CIA agent Matt Graver (Josh Brolin) with assistance from a mysterious D.O.D. consultant named Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro). Graver and Alejandro keep her in the dark on the overarching details of their operation but she begins to question the legality when the men seem to be bending the law in the name of justice. It all culminates in one final mission when Graver and his team have done enough damage to the cartel's local business to send a minor boss running back to Mexico, falling right into line with their plans to cripple the organization. When Graver's methods cross the line, Macer finds herself in a maelstrom of violence where the end may not justify the means.I love everything about SICARIO. The performances. The cinematography. The story. The music. Everything comes together so perfectly. Emily Blunt has proved in recent years that she's more than capable of handling the meatier roles with EDGE OF TOMORROW from 2014 proving she's an effective action hero and SICARIO giving her the chance to up the ante in a more realistic violent environment. Her character, Macer, acts as the audience surrogate in this world. She's seen some rough times in her career but she struggles with the cartel's level of brutality. When she begins to understand that the American task force has adapted some shady methods of its own to combat it, she's not ready to accept it as the best course of action. When she learns of Graver and Alejandro's objective and the truth behind her inclusion in the task force to begin with, it's a gut punch and Blunt nails all of it. Brolin does a fantastic job as the jovial Graver but he's overshadowed by Blunt and Del Toro. Del Toro is the other knockout performance in SICARIO. His character is an enigma. All we learn at the start is that he is a 'D.O.D. consultant' but it's not readily made clear what his role is. He keeps to himself and seems to have a pretty good understanding of cartel operations, but his real mission doesn't come out until the end. He gets his big moment at the end and we learn this is a man in pain, and he's turned that pain into a weapon. Del Toro absolutely kills it in one of his best roles ever.Another aspect of SICARIO I thought was a great touch was how Villeneuve shows us both sides of the coin. Mexico isn't our enemy. The cartels are our enemy. The problem is how much the cartels have ingrained themselves in the Mexican economy. Throughout the movie, we occasionally cut away to a nondescript Mexican family. The father is a police officer and works odd hours, often missing out on time with his son. We're given a chance to invest a little in this quiet three-person family before we learn who this man is, how he plays into the main story and what his fate will be, and then we're left to wonder about the future of his family. SICARIO presents the war against the cartels as bad for everyone. Lives are ruined. Morals are abandoned. And worst of all, there appears to be no clear end in sight. Everyone loses. SICARIO is a seriously bleak film but I love that it doesn't pull any punches or try to sugarcoat its message. This isn't an action movie in line with the Bourne films or anything of that nature; SICARIO is very much a psychological drama. I watch this movie and it's rumbling around my head for a couple days after it's over. I can't recommend this movie enough to anyone and I can't wait to see what Villeneuve brings us next.",9,3,5,18 September 2016
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Guy Ritchie's Hilarious Feature Debut
","This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors: Jason Statham (who went on to do 'Transporter', among other movies) and Vinnie Jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). Jones is especially good as Big Chris, debt collector/family man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America (aside from Sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack, ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents, anyway) so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed.",8,11,13,23 December 2007
Thor," THOR is Better Than I Expected it to Be
","Marvel continues its push towards its ultimate goal: THE AVENGERS (also known as the most ambitious comic book film endeavor ever). Before we can bring all of the major superheroes together on the big screen, we're treated to a series of introductory films for each of the main characters and that means we were given a theatrical release for someone I've always considered a B-grade character in the Marvel universe, Thor. For those unfamiliar with Norse mythology, Thor is the god of thunder and wields the powerful war-hammer Mjolnir. In the Marvel canon, he is a being from the mystical realm of Asgard. He is the son of Odin and next in line for the throne, but he's got a few personal issues to work out before Odin hands him the keys to the kingdom. Asgard's longtime enemies, the Frost Giants, sneak into the palace in an attempt to steal a powerful artifact, and Thor reacts with a desire for war. He gathers his comrades for an attack on the Frost Giant realm of Jotunheim. Thor's actions result in war between the two realms and Odin banishes Thor with hopes of teaching him a valuable lesson. Thor is stripped of his power and exiled to Earth (Midgard) while his brother Loki uses the opportunity to rise to power as ruler of Asgard.If that was hard to understand, I believe it. For anyone who hasn't seen the film and doesn't have an established understanding of the comic's canon, the plot to this film is a bunch of gibberish. I really am surprised it did as well as it did in the box office, but I'm happy to see it. I've never been much of a Thor fan and I wasn't excited to hear he'd be getting his own film. When Kenneth Branagh was brought on as director, my interest was piqued but I still had a hard time caring. The heavy fantasy/mythological angle of the Thor series never appealed to me and, even with Branagh's talent behind the camera, I was still worried that a movie trying to cram so much exposition into a single story was going to collapse under it's own weight. I was wrong to doubt THOR, as it turned out to be an excellent bit of summer popcorn fun. It's not as good as Jon Favreau's IRON MAN, but it's a fun, flashy bit of blockbuster action. Visually, it's amazing. The mystical realms of Asgard and Jotunheim look amazing; I could've watched an entire film in these realms without ever setting foot on Earth and I'd have been satisfied. The costume design somehow pulls off a miracle: making the outrageous costumes of the comic work in a serious(ish) film. Thor's winged helmet or Loki's horned piece don't stand out as comically as I thought they would.The film really looks fantastic but the story is pretty thin. In an effort to ensure they had enough time to explain what the heck we're looking at to people who've never seen the character and his world, the actual story is pretty thin. Thor is sent to Earth to learn a bit of humility and compassion, his manipulative brother tries to assume the throne, lessons learned and everyone's saved. I'm sure the next film in the franchise (and with almost a half billion in worldwide box office, it IS a franchise) will move a lot smoother now that the general population knows the character and it's new worlds. Origin stories are always the hardest to present but THOR does it pretty well. It's a fun ride with great characters (well, the Asgardians anyway) and great action, and it continues Marvel's winning streak with its line of films leading to THE AVENGERS.",7,0,0,30 October 2011
Zombieland," Best Use of Zombies Since SHAUN OF THE DEAD
","It's getting to a point where zombies just aren't frightening anymore. Most 'scary' zombies movies are cheesy schlock tossed directly onto DVD or low-budget independent films because zombies are easy enough to pull off with a basic understanding of makeup effects and enough friends/extras to fill out a crowd. Edgar Wright did the world a favor in 2004 when he reminded us that zombies could still be useful movie fodder in a comedy sense with SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Five years later, ZOMBIELAND revives the winning zombie/humor combo in one of the best horror/comedies ever. The movie was expanded from a television pilot from screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick and exists in a world where Mad Cow disease has mutated into an epidemic that turned the world's population into mindless, violent, flesh-hungry zombies. Jesse Eisenberg is a college student making his way through the desolate destruction from Texas to Columbus, OH in hopes of finding his family alive. He crosses paths with bada** zombie killer Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and the two band together on their journey eastward. On their trip, their duped by a couple of sisters who jack their wheels and redirect them towards Pacific Playland in California where rumors have spread of a zombie-free zone. ZOMBIELAND has everything you could with for in a zombie movie: it's hilarious, features some great zombie kills, boasts a couple of the latest Hollywood hotties (Emma Stone and Amber Heard), and the best cameo appearance in a movie I've ever seen.Sorry, George Romero. Zombies are funny now. As much as I'd love to see another genuinely scary zombie flick, I'm pretty sure the social commentary aspect of zombie culture has run out and now they're best used as gore-filled punch-lines with old ladies dropping pianos on their heads. I could be wrong; there's plenty of zombie movies out there I've haven't seen yet but this is the best use for them in my opinion. I really wish the pilot for the TV show had been picked up. If the writers had been able to keep up the sharp writing, the show would've been a guaranteed hit. I know I would've watched it religiously. The whole idea of the 'Zombie Kill of the Week' would've been awesome. I love the characters in this movie because they feel real. A lot of zombie movies feature survivors that are deadly serious that are always on edge, but the characters in ZOMBIELAND each have their own quirky personalities. They've been dealing with the zombie menace long enough that they're past the constant state of fear and panic and find fun in their situation. Each of them copes in their own way: Columbus with his set of rules (a great recurring gag), Tallahassee with his zombie killing creativity, and Wichita and Little Rock's quest for the rumored safety and childhood memory of Pacific Playland. Their humor, tantrums, and occasional painful memories feel legitimate. Let's be honest: if you found yourself in Hollywood, CA after zombies have slaughtered the population, wouldn't you go nuts in a celebrity mansion?I'm an idiot because I didn't see this movie until over a year after it came out. By the time I saw it, the big cameo in the second act had already been spoiled. I knew who it was, but I didn't know the details or context behind their appearance. If you haven't seen this movie and have somehow avoided spoilers, try and check it out with a clean slate. It makes the whole bit that much funnier. With the exception of the celebrity surprise, Woody Harrelson is the best part of the movie. If they ever get around to doing a ZOMBIELAND television series (or at least a sequelplease do a sequel), I hope Woody's there. Tallahassee is the best character in the group with his zombie kills, Twinkie obsession, and a back-story that comes out of left field in the second half of the movie that gave his character a whole new depth. Jesse Eisenberg makes the great 'straight-man' in comedies but he's not too different from characters his played in other movies, but he has an awesome chemistry with Harrelson and he's charismatic enough for the audience to believe he'd have a chance with a girl like Emma Stone. Stone and Abigail Breslin deserve credit for their work here, but there characters really don't amount to much more than plot devices to move the story along (a love interest for Columbus, a reason for the trip to Pacific Playland). Overall, ZOMBIELAND is one of my favorite movies from 2009 and a total must-see.",9,0,2,28 February 2012
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A Complete Mess; One of the Worst Movies of 2009
","The summer of 2009 will forever be etched in my memory as a summer of terrible sequels and REVENGE OF THE FALLEN tops the list of bad movies I've seen this year. I really enjoyed 2007's TRANSFORMERS and so went into the theater with high hopes for this action-loaded sequel, and wow...we're my dreams ever crushed. When the film begins, the Autobots have been working with the US government as part of a 'top secret' program known as NEST since the Mission City battle but the government's getting fed up with the constant Autobot/Decepticon battles. So, while the government tries to shut down NEST and send the Autobots packing to a new planet, the ancient Decepticon known as the Fallen is searching for a long-lost source of Energon on Earth in hopes of using it to raise an army.Wow, looking back at that paragraph, that synopsis does sound as if it'd make for a fun movie...but it doesn't. There were so many aspects of this movie that bothered me that I probably won't even remember to mention them all here. For one, the plot does seem to have some major holes; I cannot understand how, after such a massive city-spanning battle with hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses at the end of the first film, the Autobots are now a government secret. In addition to a shaky plot, the film also suffered from some cringe-inducing performances from characters that I didn't feel were at all necessary and could've easily been scrapped. Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's new college roommate, Leo Spitz....what was the point of him? I was fed up with his childish whining within minutes and yet got to spend the entire movie with him. And, while on the topic of useless characters, the Autobot twins Skids and Mudflap were just aggravating. From the moment they arrived, I couldn't help but picture the crows from DUMBO and I kept hoping that a Decepticon would do us all a favor and take them out.The remainder of the cast failed to grab my attention any better. Megan Fox didn't really come across as well as she did in the first film; I suppose now that the ogling from the first film is over it's easier to see her acting doesn't quite hold up as well. Shia LeBeouf spends the majority of the film moping, hardly his usual wisecracking self. The only 'highlights' were John Turturro (returning as former Sector-7 agent Simmons) and Kevin Dunn & Julie White (as Sam's parents, though even they wore out their welcome after a while). The only real compliments for the film should be directed at ILM, whose visual effects and Transformer designs are just as amazing as they were on the first film. I just wish I'd had more of an opportunity to appreciate it seeing as how the action is all shown so close-up and so fast that there are points where you can't ascertain what exactly is happening in battle.The second TRANSFORMERS film tries it's hardest to be epic in scope, but fails miserably and you can't help but feel time slow down as you sit through the exhausting 2.5 hour runtime (especially during the seemingly never-ending final battle). As I'd said, I know there are even more grievances that I'm neglecting to mention here but believe me when I say this movie was terrible compared to the first. Since it happened to nab more than $400 million at the domestic box office, another sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope the filmmakers get their act together and bring us another TRANSFORMERS movie we can be proud of.",3,3,9,27 October 2009
The Witch," THE WITCH is One of the Best Horror Films in Recent Years
","I love THE WITCH. The film is a period horror film from writer/director Robert Eggers, a man I'd never heard of but whose work I will be looking out for in the future. THE WITCH is haunting, methodical, suspenseful, and obsessed with detail. Listening to Eggers' commentary for the film, it's obvious the man has a fascination with early American life and their supernatural superstitions. It's no surprise. THE WITCH must've been a passion project brewing in his mind for a good while because he put every ounce of attention into it. It's the tale of a Puritan family in 1630's Massachusetts who are exiled from their community for the father's overbearing religious preachings that don't quite mesh with their own local beliefs. And so William (Ralph Ineson) and his wife Katherine (Kate Dickie) pack up their children and move out into the woods to start their own little farmstead. Flash forward to sometime later, the family has settled in and built a home, started a little farm, and have welcomed their fifth child. One afternoon, the infant Samuel disappears right out from under the nose of eldest daughter Thomasin (Anya Taylor-Joy). At the same time, the family crops are mysteriously dying and their animals aren't providing. The winter is approaching, their food is scarce, their youngest child is missing and presumed dead, and strange happenings lead to hushed accusations of witchcraft; there is something evil beyond the tree line and they start to fear a dark presence amongst them.With little exception, everything in this movie works 100%. It really is one of the strongest horror films I've seen in years. I love that it doesn't have to rely on jump scares and gratuitous violence or gore. Don't get me wrong, it has those but it doesn't rely on them. When Samuel disappears mid-peek-a-boo, it's just as jarring as any jump scare and, while the family is ignorant of poor Samuel's ultimate fate, we the audience are privy to it and it'll make your skin crawl. Instead of slapping you across the face with horror clichés, THE WITCH builds a tension over the course of the movie. It starts with Samuel's disappearance. Then we see the family begin to buckle under the pressure. Poor Katherine is losing her mind in grief and the two youngest children, Jonas and Mercy, become increasingly more insufferable, teasing Thomasin that Black Peter (the family's black ram) speaks to them of her wickedness. Thomasin becomes a target for Katherine's angst and poor William, who hasn't had the greatest luck since moving his family to the middle of the woods to start a new life, is doing everything in his power to keep the peace. THE WITCH is just as much a psychological thriller as it is a traditional horror. These people are isolated from the rest of society and super religious; the idea that someone in their little family might be in league with Satan is something they're actually willing to consider. It's unnerving.Of course, this is a horror film and the movie establishes that it isn't just paranoia from the very beginning. We, the audience, know of the witch in the woods. What we don't know is whether anyone in the family might be working in conjunction with it. Are the children telling the truth about whisperings from Black Peter? Or are the accusations lobbied against Thomasin based on truth? The very idea that one of the children might've dabbled in the dark arts is enough to tear the family apart in fear and suspicion. It's absolutely enthralling to watch. While everyone in this film delivers standout performances (well, except maybe Harvey Scrimshaw as middle child Caleb some of his stuff didn't sit right with me), the real accolades belong to Ralph Ineson and Anya Taylor-Joy. Ineson was perfectly cast in the role as the devout Puritan and loving father to the struggling family and elicits the most sympathy as a man just trying to keep it all together, but Taylor-Joy just knocks it out as Thomasin. From the start, she's a tormented girl. She seems absolutely miserable at the news that her family's been exiled and, despite trying her best to do her part, she keeps coming under fire from her grieving mother. There's no hesitation from her mother in blaming her when something goes wrong and the youngest children are just a royal pain. Her performance walks a line where you aren't sure if she's just good at bottling up her issues in the face of her family or if she's got something going on the side, like maybe some demonic-aided retribution against her tormentors.And I haven't even raved about how much I love the production and costume design. Eggers really went for full immersion, with period-accurate dialogue and everything. He admits to taking a few creative licenses with some aspects to better suit the story but THE WITCH, with all the talent involved in front of and behind the camera, is one of the most authentic-feeling period pieces I've seen. This all adds immeasurably to the well-written story and amazing character performances. THE WITCH won't satisfy all horror fans, and the pacing may bore some others, but it's an enthusiastic recommend from me.",9,2,6,25 March 2017
Zero Dark Thirty," A Thrilling Manhunt and One Woman's Obsession with the Mission
","I've never been much of a patriot but that doesn't mean I wasn't affected by the events of 9/11/2001. I still remember where I was when the news broke (sitting in senior English class, waiting to begin an exam) and I still remember how I couldn't quite process the events at first. Nothing of this magnitude had occurred so prominently and close to home in my lifetime. And I still remember the anger towards those responsible that I soon felt. So, while I've never been a huge supporter of a lot of our government's behavior, I was always gung-ho with the hunt for Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan (before everything turned toward Iraq and it's 'WMDs'). I became incredibly intrigued with the hunt to bring this modern face of evil to justice. ZERO DARK THIRTY is all about one woman's obsession with just that: hunting Osama bin Laden. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is somewhat new to the C.I.A. but she's got laser focus on her goal: locating the man behind the most horrific attack on American soil in decades. Her quest begins at a CIA black site where Al Qaeda operatives are being interrogated and drained of information through any means necessary, and over the course of the following ten years she will risk her career (and at times, her life) in pursuit of bin Laden. Seeing as how this is a recreation of recent historic events, we pretty much know how it will end: with a team of expertly trained Navy SEALS and a seemingly impenetrable compound in Pakistan.I've never seen Kathryn Bigelow's last major film, THE HURT LOCKER, though I have read the script (and don't recall much of anything about it). I just wasn't interested. The only war movies I've ever really been interested in focused on the Vietnam War (FULL METAL JACKET, APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON, etc.). Modern warfare just doesn't grab my attention the same as Vietnam, but I was willing to give ZERO DARK THIRTY a shot based on the subject matter. I'm glad I did because Bigelow's account of the hunt for bin Laden is tense, exciting, and had me sucked in until the end credits began to roll. A lot of the credit belongs to Jessica Chastain. She brings a severe intensity to the role of Maya. Her character is driven, focused on the hunt and only the hunt. She's a keen thinker and uses her unique perspective to pursue leads that her superiors find too insignificant to bother following. Over the course of her ten-year mission, she watches as friends die and colleagues are shamed but she pushes on relentlessly. While the overall premise of the movie is the search for bin Laden, the movie is truly Maya's story. She's our hero and it's her quest we're following, even if she doesn't really figure into the final half hour or so of the film. Noinstead the final half hour is the pay-off of two hours spent following Maya's investigation.Right, so there have been a lot of accusations against this movie with angry viewers labeling it 'propaganda.' And my response would beso what? What do you expect from a movie detailing the United States' hunt for its most hated target since World War II had us killing Nazis? The movie portrays America going to insane lengths to uncover each and every bit of information they can to bring them closer to their goal (so much so that the actual C.I.A. decided to come out and vehemently deny some elements of the movie). All of this builds up to a killer TEAM America: WORLD POLICE moment with American soldiers sneaking into Pakistan for a top secret operation culminating in the moment people have waited almost an hour and a half to watch. The propaganda complaints might not be unfounded, but I just don't care. It's an engaging movie with a real-world villaina villain that murdered thousands of innocent people. I'm not watching ZERO DARK THIRTY for the 'Hooray America!' vibes but for the manhunt and the payoff.The trick with a movie like ZERO DARK THIRTY is to go in with the mindset that you're watching a moviea fictional movieand not a documentary. Because that's what it is. I knowcrazy, right? This might be based on actual events but that doesn't mean it is 100% accurate. It is a film made for our entertainment. And it entertains. At least, it did for me. I thought ZERO DARK THIRTY was a great movie, and this is coming from a guy who doesn't normally care for these sort of movies.",9,3,6,13 July 2013
Steve Jobs," The Strength of STEVE JOBS is in the Performances
","STEVE JOBS is one of two biographical films released following the Apple visionary's untimely death. I skipped the one with Ashton Kutcher in the lead role because I knew I could never take Kutcher seriously in such a role and because I'd heard rumor of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin taking a swing at it. Here is the final product of Sorkin and director Danny Boyle and, unlike the Kutcher film, this one managed to snag a couple Academy Award nominations for some of the cast. Anyone familiar with Sorkin's writing should have a pretty good idea of what to expect in this, namely snappy dialogue and a lot of conversations on the go. Sure enough, STEVE JOBS is the ultimate 'walk and talk' movie, putting all other 'walk and talk' movies to shame. Rather than following the life of Jobs from childhood and going through the major milestones in his life, Sorkin decided to try something a little cleverer. STEVE JOBS is divided into three sections, each one set in a different time period before the launch announcement of one of Jobs' products: 1984 (the Macintosh), 1988 (the NeXT), and 1998 (the iMac). In each segment, we watch as relationships develop and crumble with key figures in Jobs' life including co-creator of Apple computers Steve Wozniak, former CEO of Apple John Sculley, and Jobs' own daughter Lisa. STEVE JOBS gives an interesting (and occasionally unflattering) glimpse into the mind of a man often hailed as a modern genius and marketing legend.This strange use of the three act structure was one of the film's more intriguing elements. I love that Sorkin decided against the usual biopic format because I don't know if it would've been as interesting. He forgoes chronological accuracy and takes a little creative license with the details, but rather he created a movie that doesn't focus on the events of Jobs' life to bring us into his world. Instead the film focuses on the people in his life. Of course, at the center of the film is Michael Fassbender's winning performance as Steve Jobs. Fassbender is a fantastic actor and he really disappears into the role. As Jobs, Fassbender is at times sympathetic and relatable while at other times his ambitions and unrelenting nature bring out his megalomaniacal side. I love that STEVE JOBS doesn't pull any punches in its portrayal of the man. So soon after the man's passing, one might have to worry that a biopic will sugarcoat the details so as to not offend close relatives or be seen as unfairly tainting a man's legacy when he's no longer around to defend himself. But STEVE JOBS plays a perfect balance and falls in line with what I've read of the man. Sorkin based his screenplay on the information from the biography written by Walter Isaacson and the movie was interesting enough that I might have to check it out. The man knew how to play the game; it'd be nice to get the full story.As powerful as Fassbender's performance is, I expect it from him. The man has never let me down. What blew my mind was the surprisingly strong performance from Seth Rogen as Steve Wozniak. Wozniak's role in the film seems to be bringing to light Jobs' inability to share the spotlight, even if it means shunning those that helped get him there. Wozniak appears at each of the three product launches in the film in hopes that Jobs will throw out an acknowledgment for the team who helped make the Apple II a success, but Jobs insists that it's the past and he's took busy looking to the future. Plus the Apple II's success made it difficult for Jobs to keep the company's focus on his new Macintosh when it didn't perform to expectations in the mid-80s. Rogen kills it in a scene where he goes toe-to-toe with Fassbender in the 1998 segment when the exchange gets heated. As unaccustomed as I am to Rogen in dramatic roles, this was an eye-opener and a strong show on his part. Jeff Daniels also gets a juicy role in the film as John Sculley, the man who's career tanks when he becomes 'the man who fired Steve Jobs' from Apple. He has a nice arc where he goes from a supportive, optimistic partner in 1984 to a defeated man in 1998 who just wants to set the record straight. Kate Winslet acts as our guide through the walking and talking as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing exec. She is Jobs' right-hand woman throughout the film and essentially leads us from conversation to conversation while doubling as the voice of reason.STEVE JOBS is a clever twist on the biopic genre. It gets all the relevant information in without following the same old structure. It does become a little problematic when you see through the film to the structure and, during a quiet or less interesting moment, find yourself running through your head which confrontations have occurred and which still need to before the movie can move on to the next segment (e.g. 'Let's see, we've already done Wozniack, Sculley, and Andy Hertzfeldugh, we still have Lisa and the reporter to get through'). There are a few slow moments where the momentum stutters but generally, for a movie that is 100% about human interactions and, well, walking and talking, STEVE JOBS has an undeniable energy that keeps it exciting to watch.",8,0,0,22 November 2016
12 Years a Slave," An Exceptional Film; the Best of 2013
","I can't remember the last time I've watched a movie as powerful as Steve McQueen's 12 YEARS A SLAVE. It's an epic film bringing to life the horrors of American slavery in the nineteenth century. We learn about the atrocities in school but it doesn't quite deliver the message as well as witnessing them with our own eyes. The plight of early African Americans has been covered in countless other films but McQueen's film has a level of authenticity I don't know that I've seen before. It's a period piece that spared no expense in bringing the plantation-era South to life and it's filled to the brim with brilliant cast. It's based on the true story of Solomon Northup (portrayed in the film by Chiwetel Ejiofor) though, as is the case with any true-life film stories, I couldn't tell you how accurate the events might be. Solomon was born a free man in the North and was living a successful life with his wife and children in New York when he was kidnapped and smuggled to New Orleans to be sold as a slave. Over the course of the next twelve years, Solomon would experience horrors no man should endure and fight to maintain his humanity when treated as nothing more than personal property. He starts on a plantation with the kind-hearted Ford (Benedict Cumberbatch) but circumstances force him into the employ of the cruel Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender). Epps and his wife are evil incarnate with total disregard for the lives of their slaves, frequently utilizing humiliation and brutal punishment to crush their spirits. With hopes of reunification with his family in the North, Solomon must scheme to regain his freedom while remaining under the nose of his violent, alcoholic owner.The production value in this film is phenomenal. I seriously hope the production team won a bundle of awards for their work on this film. Everything feels so authentic, from the costumes to the set design. And the cinematography of Sean Bobbitt is absolutely gorgeous, giving an element of beauty to a world filled with pain and suffering. I can't believe this movie was made for a mere $20 million. There are movies that cost four times as much and don't look half as good as this one. There was a tremendous amount of respect infused into the creation of 12 YEARS A SLAVE and it shines through. Respect is probably the most important trait a filmmaker needs when covering a subject as delicate as slavery in the United States. Remember, relatively speaking, it hasn't been that long since slavery was abolished in America and the ripples of the severe mistreatment of African Americans continues to affect our society even now. You don't want to overindulge in the wrong aspects of the subject matter for fear of becoming an exploitation film (unless you're Quentin Tarantino and you're directing DJANGO UNCHAINED, but that man's a master of revenge exploitation films). If you aim to break the audiences' hearts with tales of real-life cruelty, I imagine it's a fine balance of presenting the brutal violence and juxtaposing it with the unwavering strength of the protagonist in the face of it all without going overboard on one of the other out of fear that the film might a) exploit the suffering of others or b) preach a message as opposed to giving the audience an emotional experience.I can't imagine the nerve it requires to accept a role in a film such as this one. There are no good roles here, but they're all fantastic performances. No one wants to be the whip-cracking slave owner or the poor soul on the receiving end. I'm sure there was nothing easy about of it and the experience of creating this film will probably remain with its cast for a good long time. Everyone was exceptional here. Chitewel Ejiofor gave the performance of his lifetime with the role of Solomon Northup. Solomon is a strong soul and, while he wavers at times, he never loses hope that he might some day return to his normal life. He witnesses the most horrific acts of violence against his fellow slaves, and falls victim a few times himself, and he does so each time knowing that he's helpless to stop it. I agree that Matthew McConaughey did a fantastic job in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB but Ejiofor was robbed of the Academy Award for this film. The man deserved it. Recognition was given to Lupita Nyong'o for her supporting role as Patsey, Epp's prized possession. Ejiofor had it rough as Solomon but no one had it as bad as Nyong'o. Her character is the most tragic in the film. Patsey is the object of Epp's desires (to the resentment of his wife) and he's also the target for the most horrific abuse as a result. She's a broken woman and you know once the credits roll that her character would not have a happy ending. Michael Fassbender gives another standout performance as Epps and you nearly don't recognize him. It was hard to imagine Fassbender in such a hate-fueled performance but, man, he delivers. He's scary good.The rest of the cast is populated with exceptional talent. Paul Giamatti, Benedict Cumberbatch, Paul Dano, Alfre Woodard, Brad Pitt, and more fill out the expansive cast and everyone delivers their A-game. 12 YEARS A SLAVE is an exceptional film and the best of the year. It's engaging and powerful and sure to have an effect on even the hardest of hearts. Considering the subject matter, you should know to be mindful that this film can be painful to watch but it's an easy recommendation from me.",9,0,1,19 July 2014
30 Days of Night," Excellent Vampire Film, the Humans are the Weak Element
","While most modern mainstream vampire films seem to feature delicate, romantic depictions of the bloodsuckers, David Slade has done us all a favor and instead brought us the fearsome, deadly creatures of the night we love. The film is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Steve Niles, set in the town of Barrow, Alaska as it settles in for 30 days of darkness. Taking advantage of the town's long-term lack of sunlight, a pack of vampires arrive and the townspeople are left to fight for their survival over the next month. Bloody, tense, and occasionally boring...Slade has managed to create one of the better vampire films I've seen in recent years.I loved the visual style of Slade's film, courtesy of cinematographer Jo Willems. Willems captured the cool, dark tones of the graphic novel with splashes of color (primarily blood red) and I thought the film was beautiful. The violence was graphic and often brutal, giving the film the hard R rating it deserves with decapitations and dismemberment to satisfy the gore-hounds, and there's a scene with a trencher that stands out as one of the best action spots in the film. I would've easily ranked this film amongst my favorite horror movies if it weren't for the fact that nearly the first two-thirds of the film drag on so badly. The film grabs your attention from the start with the weird happenings around Barrow (stolen satellite phones found burned, town dogs murdered) but then it grinds to a near halt as the survivors spend the next hour hiding, moving from one spot to the next, while the audience is desperate for something to happen.The best performance in the film comes from Ben Foster, as a mysterious Stranger who wanders into town before night and gleefully warns the town of their impending fate. He was exceptionally creepy, with his disheveled appearance and Cajun growl. Danny Huston also stands out powerfully as Marlow, the alpha of the vampire pack. One of the creepiest moments in the film has Huston mocking his prey while she pleads 'Oh God', Huston taking a moment to glance around the sky in search before staring her in the eye and uttering...'No God'. The vampires really were the stars of this film; with their pupil-less eyes, pale skin, and jowls covered in blood from their recent kills, these are the vampires we want to see...primal and animalistic in nature. The humans in the film don't fair so well. The performances weren't terrible but they were outshone by their undead costars and I spent most moments eagerly awaiting the next attack scene instead of becoming involved in their struggles. Josh Harnett does a fair job as Eben Oleson, the sheriff of Barrow and leader of the human survivors. Melissa George, beautiful as she is, adds nothing too significant to the cast as Eben's estranged wife.The vampires are what make this movie so fun to watch but we spend a bit too long hiding from them, rather than confronting them. The first time I saw the film, I lost interest pretty fast until the final act when the humans began to fight back with whatever tools they could find. Still, I don't judge the film too harshly because it was one of the few as of late to paint vampires in a more bloodthirsty light, and for that, this film is worth watching.",7,0,2,13 January 2010
There Will Be Blood," One of my favorite movies of 2007
","This movie was my first exposure to the work of Paul Thomas Anderson and I now completely understand the hype surrounding his work. Despite it's apparent simplicity, I really enjoyed this movie. The movie focuses on Daniel Plainview, an oilman from the early years of the 20th century, and his rise to success. Along the way, he sets up shop in a small town called Little Boston and finds himself at odds with the town's preacher, Eli Sunday. On the surface, that appears to be all there is to this film. I found myself drawn in after the first 15 minutes of watching and I was immersed until it ended.The film moves slowly, but you never really notice it. It's got a longer running time than most films (roughly 2 hours, 40 minutes) but I never found myself looking at the time, waiting for it to end. All-in-all, the movie didn't really lose it's pace with the exception of a section in the second act involving the a surprise arrival into Daniel's life. Seeing as how this movie is primarily a character piece, its the performances that really drive the film. Having finally seen the film, I can honestly say that Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely deserved the Academy Award he won for his portrayal of Plainview. This is a man we see slowly becoming obsessed with his business and absorbed into his success until the final act. Day-Lewis is so charasimatic an actor, that despite some of the cruel things we see Plainview pull off in this movie, I still found myself pushing for the character. Paul Dano also contributes a great performance in his role of Eli, the evangelical preacher and thorn in Plainview's side. My favorite moments in this film are the interactions between Plainview and Sunday, particularly in the final act. These two men worked fantastically together and you could always feel the underlying tension and hostility when they conversed.One final note, I have to mention the great production value in this movie. If you had the benefit of purchasing the collector's edition DVD, be sure to take a look at the special features. It includes a 15-minute feature consisting of comparisons between pictures of the oil industry from that era and scenes from the movie. The production crew did an amazing job recreating early 20th century California. Everything from the wardrobe to the oil derricks, everything looks and feels authentic.If this movie is the kind of quality Paul Thomas Anderson puts into his movies, then I've missed out on way too much and I know I'll be going back to check out his previous works.",8,3,6,13 April 2008
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Jack Nicholson's Best Performance
","Jack Nicholson is at his best in this classic Oscar award winner from 1975. ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is one of only three movies in the history of the Academy awards to win the 'big five' in it's year: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actor, and Best Actress. For the uninitiated who might not recognize the scope of such an achievement, just know that's incredibly rare and very impressive. The film is based on the novel of the same name, written by Ken Kesey (whose renowned in other circles for his band of Merry Pranksters and his electric Kool-Aid acid test in the sixties). The novel was originally based on Kesey's own experiences working as an overnight orderly in a sanitarium, the movie is said to very slightly (the book was written from the first-person perspective of the Chief, a supporting character in the movie) but otherwise remains accurate. Randle P. McMurphy (Nicholson) is transferred from a work farm penitentiary to a psych ward when his penchant for fighting arouses questions of his sanity. McMurphy sees his new home in the ward as a chance to cruise an easy life until he is released but fails to realize when it entails. The ward is overseen by the strict Nurse Ratched, a cold-hearted woman who takes her position unwaveringly seriously and shows little interest in seeing her patients as human beings. In his time at the ward, McMurphy makes it his goal to inject a little life into his new 'feeble-minded' friends and light a fire under Nurse Ratched's miserable rule.Nicholson rightfully won the Academy award for his role here as McMurphy. It's probably my favorite role he's done; one of his best, right up there with his insane performance in THE SHINING. He's an over-confident, free-spirited goofball and you immediately rally with him on his crusade against Ratched. He struts into the ward one day and immediately rattles the establishment. His explosive approach to life begins to work more effectively on the patients that anything Nurse Ratched has attempted. For the first time, the patients on the ward are speaking their minds and it isn't sitting well with the staff. Louise Fletcher is the iconic Nurse Ratched, a performance that has been paid homage to hundreds of times over the years. Ratched is considered one of the top cinematic 'villains' of all time, but I have a hard time buying into that. Ratched is a horrible person, no doubt about that (and played to cold perfection by Fletcher). But she doesn't come across to me as someone who's inherently evil. She's just doing her job and happens to totally lack in compassion. Her perpetual restrained anger and steadfast desire to follow procedure, regardless of how miserable it leaves the residents of the ward, makes for a fun conflict between her and McMurphy. Still, as great as Nicholson and Fletcher are, the real scene-stealers in this film are the exceptional supporting cast.Let's name some of the highlights: Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd (in his first major film role), character actor Vincent Schiavelli, and the debut of Brad Dourif. The patients on the ward are a great collection of eccentric performances and great personalities. DeVito is hilarious as Martini, a feeble-minded man who appears to find infantile joy in just about everything, and Lloyd is downright psychotic as Taber. He plays the character with just a hint of rage inside (you can see if in the end as he's staring on during the final McMurphy/Ratched confrontation), but enough that you kind of wonder how he's allowed with the general populace. As for Dourif, I didn't even recognize him the first time I saw the movie. He does an amazing job for his first major film and I'm a bit surprised he went on to more eccentric genre performances than valuable dramatic roles. And these are just the recognizable faces in the crew; everyone in the ward does an astounding job of earning the audiences affections, especially Sydney Lassick as Cheswick. It's impossible not to feel sorry for the poor guy as he begins to cling to McMurphy, practically idolizing him. The cast in this movie is superb and the best part of the experience. The movie itself is engaging and contains some of the most iconic moments in recent cinema history (the Chief's escape has been parodied just about everywhere). It can move a littler slower at times and it sort of gets off track for a moment when the patients take a field trip, courtesy of McMurphy. Otherwise, it's a totally engaging film and a memorable experience.",8,1,2,6 March 2012
Edge of Tomorrow," A Sci-Fi/Action Gem Lost in the Summer Shuffle of 2014
","I get the impression that EDGE OF TOMORROW is a film that most people will forget ever existed within a year of it's release. Despite being a big budget sci-fi action film with Tom Cruise in the lead, this movie went almost completely ignored by audiences. Including me. Unfortunately, I paid no attention to this movie during its theatrical run and contributed to its depressingly low box office haul. It's a high concept sci-fi action that's well written and populated with a strong cast; it should've done better than it did to encourage more interesting films out of the studios. Based on a Japanese novel (that I've never read), the story follows Major Cage (Cruise) in the midst of an alien invasion that has consumed Europe and threatens to soon spread across the rest of the globe. The aliens, dubbed Mimics, are an impossibly skilled species of killers that can seemingly predict humanity's every plan and prepare for it. Cage, an official with the military's public relations department, is assigned to be on the front line to record their invasion of Normandy for humanity's latest attempt, Operation: Downfall. Panicked, he tries to blackmail his way out and finds himself arrested and dropped on the front lines, no longer as a media specialist but as a deserter reassigned to an infantry unit. His first real taste of war ends as one would expect when he dies at the hands of one of the aliens' 'Alphas' but not before introducing it to the business end of a claymore mine. He dies, covered in the Alpha's blood, and finds himself awakening moments later at the start of the day, reliving events. Cage is now on an endless loop of death on the frontlines and the only person who understands his plight is the 'Angel of Verdun', a celebrated soldier named Rita (Emily Blunt) who has experienced the same phenomenon.Tom Cruise once again proves that, while I'm baffled by his personal life, he is a solid actor. His character, Major Cage, has a full arc over the course of the film as he transforms from a cowardly media relations specialist into a killing machine who is willing to selflessly sacrifice himself if needed to end the Mimics' invasion. Despite Cruise's history of playing the near-invincible action hero, he is totally believable in the beginning of the film when Cage is so terrified of seeing combat that he's willing to attempt blackmail on a general. His counterpart in the film is Rita, played in a surprising turn by Emily Blunt. I'm only familiar with Blunt from comedies so her role of a decorated military alien murder machine is mind-blowing in how well she does. Blunt has gravitas and you never question her character's ability to slaughter hordes of enemies on the front lines. Best of all, the filmmakers never bother to cram a love story between Cage and Rita into the plot as most summer big-budget action movies would be prone to do. Cage and Rita keep their relationship professional (mostly) and keep their focus on winning the war. In order to defeat the Mimics, they will need to locate and destroy their Omega, an organism that essentially acts as the central brain for the species. Cage's ability to restart the day each time he dies comes from a direct connection to the Omega, so he is now humanity's final hope in defeating the alien threat.I have never read the novel on which EDGE OF TOMORROW is adapted ('All You Need Is Kill' by Hiroshi Sakurazakaand arguably a way cooler title) so I don't know who all deserves the credit for crafting such an awesome story structure, whether it be Sakurazaka, screenwriters McQuarrie and the Butterworths, or director Doug Liman. Cage dies a lot in this film, in fun and creative ways, and we're exposed to a lot of the same material over and over. But it never becomes repetitive or gets old. Each trip back through the day only shows what we need to see and advances the plot. It's a creative plot device that sets it apart from the usual linear storytelling and cookie- cutter plot structures the theaters are inundated with during the summer months. EDGE OF TOMORROW will do down as 2014's most under-appreciated movie, as audiences didn't exactly flock to see it and the hype machine died down real fast (despite critic's praises). I recommend this to anyone in the market for some blockbuster entertainment that isn't the same old grind. If I were to lobby any complaint against EDGE OF TOMORROW (aside from that horrible 'Live, Die, Repeat' tagline that became the movie's unofficial second title), it would be the alien design. The Mimics are masses of writing tentacles and do little to impress or frighten. But that's a minor complain for a movie that is otherwise incredibly solid with terrific performances from Cruise and Blunt. If you haven't seen EDGE OF TOMORROW, go do so and see if you agree.",8,8,10,28 March 2015
Whiplash," A GREAT Film; Simmons Deserved Every Award He Received
","WHIPLASH is an insane rush. Who would've thought a movie about jazz drumming could be so intense? Or good? Seriously, just go scroll through the list of awards this movie took home. Jazz, normally a subject I would make an effort to avoid, is the heart of this film about young Andrew Neimann (Miles Teller) who is accepted into the Schaffer Conservatory's award-winning jazz band as an aspiring drummer. Andrew loves jazz drumming, spending 100% of his waking hours listening to it, talking about it, or practicing it (except the odd occasion when he's not taking in a classic movie with his dad). Sounds like the opportunity of a lifetime, yeah? Enter Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons). Fletcher is the head of the band and a jazz aficionado, and he does not accept anything short of perfection. His methods are unconventional and, well, downright abusive. He often recites a tale of Jo Jones throwing a cymbal at Charlie Parker's head and how it supposedly inspired Parker to become the legendary drummer he's known as, and he has apparently based his entire teaching method on that one moment. If Andrew wants the opportunities being in Fletcher's band will afford him, he is going to have to push himself to the limit and beyond. But that sort of dedication doesn't come without a price and the strain of it all becomes overwhelming. Does Andrew have the drive needed to become the jazz drumming legend he aspires to be? Or will he fold under the pressure?Only two things matter in WHIPLASH: characters (well, two of them anyway) and drums. Story is a distant third. As amazing a film as WHIPLASH is, it's not for the creative plot. There are very few risks taken story-wise and there are minor subplots that are picked up and dropped almost immediately. Melissa Benoist is lovely as Nicole, a movie theater concessions employee on whom Andrew has a crush, but as soon as he gets the nerve to ask her out he's breaking up with her a scene later. Her entire role in the film was to demonstrate how Andrew is willing to sacrifice parts of his life to ensure his focus remains on drumming and only drumming. There's a slight callback to it later with a bit of 'too little, too late' closure, but that's all it amounts to. No, this movie succeeds because of Teller and Simmons. I primarily know Miles Teller as being the guy I'm always confusing with Shia LaBeouf (could've sworn he was the sidekick in CONSTANTINE) and Sam Huntington (could've sworn he was the sidekick in Dylan DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT) but, apparently, I've only ever actually seen him in PROJECT X (which I don't remember) and now the 2015 reboot of FANTASTIC FOUR. So he couldn't have picked a better film to break out of obscurity with. He's pretty awesome here. His character, Andrew, goes through a distinct change over the course of the film. Well, that's not accurate. More of an awakening. I'm almost certain the Andrew we see at the end of the film as within him the entire time, and it just took Fletcher to drag it out of him.And speaking of Fletcher, J.K. Simmons totally owns this role. It's no surprise the man won a boatload of awards for this performance. The man's intense. We've seen a taste of it with his hot-tempered J. Jonah Jameson in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series but here he's given a fully realized character to sink his teeth into. Fletcher is abusive, no argument there, but he's got a personal ambition he's striving for. Every insult flung, every chair tossedhe's doing it for a reason. Jazz is his life. His entire world, really. He is on a personal mission to find the next era of great jazz musicians; he just has a less-than- legal means of weeding out the losers. Teller is fantastic in the film but Simmons steals every scene he's present in. His character is just incredibly interesting. The big climax of the film between Andrew and Fletcher, of which I'll spare any details here, is one of the most intense sequences I've seen all year. And I can barely stand jazz. Just as FOXCATCHER did with wrestling, WHIPLASH takes a subject about with I care almost nothing and turns it into an amazing film. The movie plows along at a breakneck pace and I'm engaged from beginning to end; by the time the end credits roll and we're let loose, you'll almost feel whiplash yourself. Big recommend from me.",9,1,3,22 December 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Crazed Debauchery at it's Finest
","Who doesn't love to watch rich people have all the fun us normal folks couldn't afford in our wildest dreams? Martin Scorsese gives us more than we can handle in THE WOLF OF WALL STREET, where an insane amount of time is given to reminding us how boring life is when you're trapped living paycheck to paycheck. The film claims not to be glorifying the lavish life of a criminal but, c'mon, no one can watch this film without at least a handful moments where you wish it were you in the scene. It's a surreal, drug-fueled odyssey of one conman's rise to the top and the non-stop party that went with it. It's based on the real life experiences of stockbroker Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio, in the film), how he became a multimillionaire at the expense of others, and his ultimate downfall when the FBI finally close in on him. Jordan starts at the bottom with a powerful Wall Street firm and, when a market crash ends with his dismissal, Belfort uses the knowledge he gained from his coked-out mentor (Matthew McConaughey, in a short cameo) and gathers a rag-tag crew to open his own firm where he starts pushing penny stocks to postmen and eventually upgrades to one of the most successful firms in America. His rise to power is meteoric, his illicit practices rake in millions, and he celebrates in the most illustrious ways imaginable. Drugs, cars, women, and more drugsBelfort's love of excess and insatiable desire for money and power will eventually result in his downfall. In the meantime, it's one crazy ride.THE WOLF OF WALL STREET is an insane three hours in length but it really says something for the movie that you never once feel bored. There is always just so much going on; it's a rush. For the first act of the movie, we witness Jordan's beginnings in the world of Wall Street. At the start, he's just a young man with ideals and big dreams. He sees all the potential of a career in investing and dreams of providing a comfortable life for his beautiful wife. He quickly grabs the attention of big time broker Mark Hanna who gives him the rundown of how life on Wall Street really works. The secret ingredients to success are hookers, cocaine, and a talent for lying. Clients are nothing more than ATMs to line you pockets with their hard-earned cash under the impression that they might earn some extra cash for retirement. Belfort is a fast learner and uses his skills to traverse the criminal path, training an army of loyal minions and dazzling them with extravagant parties and loads of debauchery. The movie works because it gives the audience a chance to connect with Belfort in the beginning while he's still got some humanity left. By the time he goes over the edge, we're just having fun watching them toss little people and engage in coke-fueled orgies. Part of you almost wants Belfort to get away with it all because we're having fun just soaking it all in, but Belfort is still the villain.It's not long before the FBI takes notice and Agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler) is assigned to check into Belfort and his firm. He pops onto the scene about halfway into the movie but the investigation doesn't become the focus until much later, once we've about had our fill of craziness. I loved the whole cat-and-mouse game between Belfort and Denham. Belfort believed himself to powerful to fall and Denham bides his time, waiting for the proper moment to strike while gathering as much intel as he could. Belfort's biggest partner-in-crime is his friend Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill). Dude, Hill was great. His character's a rat and probably more drunk on power than Belfort himself. He's careless and crass, and this is probably my favorite Jonah Hill performance. I haven't seen MONEYBALL so this was my first exposure to Hill's dramatic side (even if he's still the biggest clown in the film), and he's awesome. The rest of the cast is loaded with talent including Rob Reiner, Jon Favreau, and Jean Dujardin. With Scorsese at the helm, THE WOLF OF WALL STREET has an element of class juxtaposed with the constant barrage of nude women and drugs-crazed antics. I really loved this movie and find it an easy recommendation for anyone who was curious to see it. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill are a fantastic team and Scorsese's film is, in a word, insane.",9,1,4,2 August 2014
"Hail, Caesar!"," HAIL, CAESAR! is One of the Funniest Movies of 2016
","The Coen brothers bring us back to the golden age of the Hollywood studio system with their 2016 comedy HAIL, CAESAR! On the scale of Coen comedies, I find this one is more entertaining than BURN AFTER READING but never reaches the heights of their (in my opinion) best, THE BIG LEBOWSKI. It's an easy watch with a relatively simple story that relies a bit on the viewer having either nostalgia for 1950s era Hollywood movies or an appreciation for the studio system of decades ago. I fall into the latter category, loving this frenetic voyage back to the 1950s where we're to tag along with studio head Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) to witness a day in his life as he juggles problem after problem. Mannix is an honorable man with boundless loyalty to the studio but the stress has taken its toll on him. As the film begins, he receives an order from the men above him to move famed musical cowboy Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich) to the studio's latest period drama, much to the classical director's extreme dismay. Meanwhile the studio's star synchronized swimmer DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) has become pregnant out of wedlock, which could become a PR disaster, and the lead actor (George Clooney) from the studio's biblical epic, the titular HAIL, CAESAR!, has gone missing. Mannix races to solve these problems while fending off twin Hollywood reporters (Tilda Swinton in a dual role) eager to break a story that might damage the studio's delicate reputation.I found this movie to be indescribably fun. It's got a manic pacing that races you through from start to finish and encourages further viewings to catch jokes you might've missed the first time. It's a bright, colorful adventure through the eyes of the over-worked Mannix who moves from issue to issue without missing a beat. It's full of fast-talkers and oddball characters. If I were to complain about anything, it would be that there's so many interesting scenarios playing out over the course of the movie that we didn't get enough time to thoroughly dig in. The Hobie Doyle issue, where a simple cowpoke finds himself tossed into the stiffest of dramas with an auteur director (played by Ralph Fiennes) who is equally panicked at having to somehow teach his new star how to show some class, has some of the funniest moments in the movie but it's relegated to a secondary plot. I could watch an entire movie on that situation alone. Give Ehrenreich and Fiennes a spin off film documenting the making of that movie-within-a-movie. The primary plot thread, obviously, is the abduction of the studio's biggest star Baird Whitlock from the set of HAIL, CAESAR! Clooney can play aloof with the best of them and he's got a comedic timing that isn't put on display nearly often enough. His Whitlock awakens from his abduction in a gorgeous seaside home surrounded by strange men and, not only rolls with it, he comes to believe in their mysterious cause.Much of the film's fun comes from the madcap journey behind the scenes of the movie studio system of the 50s. Mannix's business takes him behind the scenes of a massive synchronized swimming sequence (a relic of decades past) and, more interestingly, a Hollywood musical. We get an entire song and dance sequence featuring Channing Tatum as the star of an old Navy musical where he and a team of sailors lament their future lack of dames on the high seas to an upbeat tune. I thought it was interesting to see what sort of stuff went into the choreography and camera blocking. It's fun. Everything about this movie is a blast and it's a shame to see it didn't receive a whole lot of love from audiences. I guess you need to have at least a passing interest in the subject matter to find the entertainment here, otherwise it must come across as a lot of fast-talking gibberish laid over a scatter-brained plot that can't seem to find its focus. I wholeheartedly disagree, as I've found HAIL, CAESAR! to be massively re-watchable and I've yet to find myself bored with it. It has a contagious positive vibe in this love letter to a Golden Age of film. Coen fans should find plenty to appreciate here and I hope more casual fans or less-informed mainstream audiences will give the film a chance and find something to enjoy as well, whether it be the performances, the production, or the sense of humor.",8,0,3,25 March 2017
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," ANCHORMAN Got Funnier with Time
","A former girlfriend once introduced me to ANCHORMAN years ago, swearing it was the funniest movie ever. At the time, I wasn't impressed. It was the usual Will Ferrell routine: over-reactions, loudness, absurdity, and a lead character will an obnoxious level of self- confidence. I must have mentally blocked the movie because, for the longest time, I couldn't remember anything from the movie except 'I love lamp' because I had friends who'd quote it. With a new ANCHORMAN movie on the horizon and my appreciation for Will Ferrell somehow growing (I actually enjoyed 2012's THE CAMPAIGN and CASA DE MI PADRE), I decided to give this movie another shot and I actually discovered that I wasn't as harsh on it this time around. It took a few more viewings but I'm almost starting to understand why this movie has such a fan base. ANCHORMAN is set in the world of broadcast news in the 1970s. Ron Burgundy (Ferrell) is the #1 anchorman in San Diego, a beloved celebrity at the top of his game with the support of his Channel 4 news team: Champ Kind (David Koechner), Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and Brick Tamland (Steve Carell). The times are changing and diversity is the new hot topic, so the network decides to hire Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) as part of the team. A woman in the world of network news doesn't sit well with the Channel 4 team and her arrival sends them into a frenzy, except for Burgundy who takes a shine to the new arrival.Without a doubt, ANCHORMAN is stupid. I'm not going to defend it in that regard, but I will argue that it's stupid/funny. It's certainly not the work of comedic genius my girlfriend had preached it to be, but I'd be lying if I didn't get some good laughs from it. In my opinion, Ferrell's best characters are always the same character. As an actor, he's got a little range but he's only really at his best when he is playing a character with an arrogant sense of confidence and a tendency to yell his lines incoherently when he's distraught. Burgundy is all of this at Ferrell's usual extreme. He's a decent character who actually seems to have a little humanity inside as he's the only one who is not only not threatened by Corningstone's initial arrival, he sees a beautiful woman that he has more than a passing interest in. Christina Applegate holds her own pretty well against the unstoppable force of Will Ferrell. Applegate plays Veronica as confident, talented, and passionate about her career; she is determined to break into the 'men-only' world of network news and she's not going to let a couple mental lightweights stand in her way. But she's also sympathetic and not the usual 'stone-hearted feminist' you might expect to find filling this role in a comedy. But as well as Ferrell and Applegate do in ANCHORMAN, most of the best parts are the result of some excellent supporting cast.Despite Ron Burgundy's name being prominently displayed in the title of the movie, the funniest bits don't come from Burgundy's personal struggles but from the interactions with the entire Channel 4 News Team and more-so when they are face-to-face with their rivals from the other networks. The WEST SIDE STORY gang fight sequence between the different news crews makes the whole movie worth watching and provides the movie with all it's best cameo appearances (that I won't spoil here in case the person reading my comments hasn't seen the movie). David Koechner is sports anchor Champ Kind, who is just an exaggerated version of Koechner's usual characters: loud and obnoxious, usually Southern. He's all right, though he always seems to play the same person. Rudd (who I'd totally forgotten was even in the movie) is man-on-the-street Brian Fantana. Rudd's always great. Even in movie's I can barely stomach, Rudd is generally great. Fantana's the team's sexed-up self-proclaimed ladies' manin his mind anyway. And Steve Carell is weatherman Brick Tamland, a perfect opportunity to showcase Carell's talents for saying completely off-the-wall dialogue with an absolute straight face. Brick is'special'and Carell never fails to elicit laughs. It's no surprise that some of the most funniest bits are from Carell ('Yeah, there were horses and a man on fire. And I killed a guy with a trident.'). I've seen this movie a few times now and I'm enjoying more and more each time. Actually, thinking back on it now is making me want to watch it again. After avoiding the movie for so long, I've come to understand why ANCHORMAN is one of Ferrell's most popular movies. It's so dumb, it's funny.",8,0,0,5 July 2013
Dark Shadows," Amusing Movie but Ultimately Unimpressive
","I'm finding more and more difficult to have a coherent opinion on the collaborative movies of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. It's tough to complain about one of their movies because, really, after eight movies togetheryou know what you're getting and you get what you paid for. When I see a trailer for a new Burton/Depp movie, I'm never concerned with whether it's a great movie, what the premise is, who's starring, etc. You know what it's going to be before you ever settle in to watch it: Gothic, eccentric, visually stimulating, and a good chance for weak substance. I've come to a point where I don't bother going to Burton movies in the theater (though I made an exception for ALICE IN WONDERLAND because it was one of the few movies I was interested in seeing in 3D). Now I wait for home video and watch them when the Burton mood strikes. DARK SHADOWS falls easily into that categorya mediocre movie that is just interesting enough that I know I'll go back to it once a year or so. The movie is based on a cheap Gothic soap opera from the '60s that, I'll admit, I've never watched. I was aware of it, and I know it's got a decent cult following. That's the extent of it. It centers on the character of Barnabas Collins (Depp), a man born into a wealthy family of the 1700s who made a mistake of scorning a witch. In return for his refusing her love, she destroys his life and turns him into a vampire and buries him to suffer for eternity. He's unearthed in 1972 and returns to his family estate to find it in ruins. He makes it his mission to revive his family's fishing business and renew their good name, but his past has returned to haunt him.I wasn't sure what I was walking in to with this movie. The original series was played straight but the trailers for the movie set it up as a comedy. DARK SHADOWS is somewhere in between. It tries to retain a serious note to the whole ordeal but stoops to easy laughs as Barnabas adjusts to life in the '70s. There were moments in the movie where I couldn't tell if it was trying to be funny. The movie has its share of laughs but it's nearly outweighed by a disappointingly boring plot. The bulk of the movie is about Barnabas and his jaded former lover/witch Angie Bouchard (Eva Green) and there's a good deal of time spent with Barnabas spurring his family into action to save their good name. Nothing too exciting but the movie is a decent distraction and your average Burton fan will probably be satisfied. There is nothing to brag about here with one exception: the soundtrack. Being that the movie is set in the '70s, we're treated to some great music: Donovan, Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper (who makes an appearance in the film), the Moody Blues, etc. The music is the best part of the whole movie.DARK SHADOWS has a few of the usual Burton players with a few new additions. There is, of course, Depp as Barnabas Collins. Depp has done so many eccentric characters that I forget what 'normal' Johnny Depp acts like. Barnabas merely fades into the ongoing assault of bizarre characters Depp continues to add to his resume. He's good, as you would expect with Depp, but there is nothing about this character that will stand out over his previous. Helena Bonham Carter is here as the family's live-in psychiatrist, Dr. Hoffman. She's about what you expect from her in another Burton film. Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty strong (and beautiful as ever) as Elizabeth Stoddard, the head of the remaining Collins family, and Jackie Earle Haley is a great little bit of comic relief as the bumbling handyman Willie Loomis. Chloë Grace Moretz is equal parts creepy and disturbingly adult as the moody teen-aged daughter, Carolyn. She goes a little overboard in the 'moody/crazy' bit but she's great up until the final half hour when her secret is revealed and her dialogue gets lazy. And then there's Eva Green as Angie Bouchard. Green blew me away as Vesper Lynd in the fantastic CASINO ROYALE but, wow, is she cheesy here. I mean, really cheesy. If her character weren't so hot, she'd be outright aggravating with her hamming. It's all right though because it all balances out. As with a lot of recent Burton movies, DARK SHADOWS is wonderful visually and has a crazy fun premise with other-worldly characters but fails to rise above the rank of average.",6,0,0,24 December 2012
Hancock," Inconsistent but Manages to Entertain
","From what I understand, this movie went through a lot of trouble and changes during the production process. I can believe it, as the movie feels sort of erratic and can't seem to keep its focus. The film follows the title character, an alcoholic (and generally unloved) superhero in Los Angeles who is more famous for his careless destruction than his heroic acts. After saving the life of a public relations representative, Hancock begins to refine his image in hopes of becoming the hero the city needs.At least, that's what the first half of the movie is about. If the entire movie had focused on this one storyline and fleshed it out more, I think it would've been a vast improvement. Instead, the movie completely shifts gears halfway through into a story about Hancock's origins and how it's come to affect his life and those he's met. Rather than making two good movies out of these elements, the filmmakers opted to make one decent (though mediocre) movie with everything crammed into a little more than 90 minutes. It also seemed as if the movie couldn't decide on whether it wanted to be a light-hearted, fun superhero flick or a deeper, emotional drama about seeking acceptance. In short, the film feels inconsistent in content and the most enjoyable elements are the few action scenes and the performances of the main cast.Of course, Will Smith was a great lead for the film (as has come to be expected). The man's over-loaded with charisma and you can't help but love his character, even when the character is as reckless and resentful as Hancock. Even with such an average movie, Smith manages to shine through. Jason Bateman is Ray Embrey, the PR agent who makes it his mission to help Hancock become a real hero; he was an ample supporting player to Smith and brought a kind-hearted naivety to his role. Personally, my favorite performance in the film was Charlize Theron as Mary, Ray's wife. I won't say much about her character because it falls too easily into spoiler-territory but I thought she was great (especially in the final act of the film).Plot and pacing issues aside, this film does manage to entertain. It has a tendency to drag in some moments but the cast keep the whole movie afloat. While there aren't a whole lot of action scenes, the few that exist are great. It's worth a viewing though don't go out of your way for this Will Smith summer action flick.",7,1,2,20 January 2009
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Peter Jackson's Epic Six-Movie Tolkien Series Ends with a Disinterested Shrug
","Finally, Bilbo Baggins returns to the Shire. After three bloated movies originating from around 300 pages of content, we've reached the end and I'm so glad to be done with it all. After a total of six movies set in Peter Jackson's Middle Earth, I'm totally fine with never hearing the word Hobbit again. His HOBBIT series concludes with the grand finale, THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES. When we last saw Bilbo (Martin Freeman), Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), and their company of dwarven companions, they had been left to gape helplessly as the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) got tired of chasing them through the mountain kingdom of Erebor and took to the skies to burn neighboring Laketown to cinders. This movie rejoins the action at that very moment, abandoning the dwarfs to focus on Smaug and local hero Bard (Luke Evans), who chooses to engage the dragon. Ten or so minutes later, the whole dragon plot that kept us trudging to the theater for these movies is resolved and we spend the next three hours on the titular battle. You see, Thorin immediately begins to succumb to what the dwarfs call 'dragon-sickness' and what us normal folk would call 'greed'. He's got his rightful kingdom back with more gold than he could ever need, and now he refuses to share it with anyone. The men of Laketown, led by Bard, come knocking in hopes of at least getting some gold for their dwarven-caused dragon troubles (i.e. the incineration of their entire town) and Thorin refuses. Even the woodland elves of Mirkwood Forest come stomping in with an army to demand a share. And, of course, the orc commander Azog has unfinished business with Thorin, having devoted two full previous movies to hunting the would-be dwarven king in hope of ending his bloodline. So all of these armies converge on the front lawn of Erebor forwait for itthe battle of the five armies.Six movies deep into this franchise and I can safely say THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is my least favorite of the bunch. I was so burned out on Middle Earth by the time this movie came around that I refused to see it in the theater. It's the only Peter Jackson/Tolkien movie that I never saw in the theater. I didn't bother watching it until the extended editions were released. In a movie that already feels like 90% filler, I can only imagine what had been added after the theatrical release. Sadly, most of this movie is utterly forgettable. The visual effects are impressive and the 45 minute final battle sequence certainly looks good, but did we need any of this? I don't think so. And, come on, 45 minutes is just too much. That's 45 minutes of CGI swarms of dwarfs, elves, orcs, and men hacking and slashing at each other and the occasional diversion to see what our heroes are doing so the story can keep pushing on. This means that every so often we'll break way so we can seeI don't knowLegolas (Orlando Bloom) hanging upside down from a giant bat monster while swinging his arms wildly to slice and dice a bunch of cartoon monsters that aren't really there. If I sound biased against this movie, it's because I believe its existence to be completely unnecessary and the whole exercise of creating it a gratuitous waste of time for Jackson and his crew. Tolkien's tale could've been handled in two better-paced films. I've been against the heavy use of CGI in these movies since AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY was released and this film just shoves it in my face with unmercifully long sequences of those same hated CG effects bouncing off each other. Would it have killed them to use some of those amazing practical costume/makeup effects for orcs in the foreground to give it an added sense of realism?THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES is only really interesting for the first act and the final act. Everything in the middle could've been trimmed generously. Unfortunately, when the big tragic moments begin to happen in the final act of the battle, I'm so worn out from the battle itself that they hold no weight. By that point, I'm just wishing we could skip to the end. THE BATTLE OF THE FIVE ARMIES isn't a horrible film but I can't imagine it rising to the top and becoming anyone's favorite Jackson/Tolkien movie. It's got some nice stuff in there. Martin Freeman is still perfect for the role of Bilbo, even if he has nothing to do here. I loved the addition of Billy Connolly to the cast as Thorin's cousin Dain and I loved his behind-the-scenes interviews even more, where he admits that he never cared for Tolkien's work and freely mocked anyone who did. Smaug is still awesome for what little time we're given with him, and Jackson even found a way to shoehorn Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving, and Christopher Lee into the series one last time. If I remember the novel correctly, Tolkien spares us the full details of the battle, choosing to knock Bilbo out when the action starts and filling him in later. In my ideal cut of Jackson's HOBBIT series, we'd get the same treatment. Bilbo is knocked unconscious and the movie would fade out; we fade in, the battle is over, the surviving characters fill us in on what happened in the form of a flashback montage. Keeps the movie a pleasant length and spares us from battle fatigue. In retrospect, I still enjoy Jackson's HOBBIT movies. The first one is enjoyable enough and was actually pretty solid. This third one thoughouch. An epic six movie series and it ends with a shrug. That's the real disappointment.",6,4,6,18 June 2016
Inception," Christopher Nolan's Mind-Bending Action Film
","Christopher Nolan continues to remind us he's more than just the best Batman director ever. After blowing audience minds with THE DARK KNIGHT (one of my favorite movies), Nolan wrote and directed this original project, a mind-bending action film that seems to have inspired endless conversation from those who've seen it. The film centers on a pair of expert thieves who have mastered the practice of breaking into a subject's mind to steal their secrets while they dream. Dom Cobb (DiCaprio) is a fugitive from the US and continues in hopes of eventually returning home to see his children. He is given hope when he and his partner are approached by businessman wealthy Saito (Watanabe) to perform inception...planting the seed of an idea in a target's mind. If Cobb and his team can pull this off, he is promised the chance to return to his children. Cobb assembles a team and a complex plan is put into motion to enter the dreams of the Saito's rival and plant the idea that he should dismantle his dying father's business empire. To do so, the team will need to infiltrate multiple levels of the subconscious and Dom will need to overcome the demons inhabiting his own mind.2010 was a strong year for DiCaprio, first with Scorsese's awesome SHUTTER ISLAND and now INCEPTION. He does great here, as does Joseph Gordon-Levitt as his partner Arthur. Gordon-Levitt shows some real promise for action, especially in the zero-G hallway fight sequence. He makes up for the crappy bobble-head role as Cobra Commander in 2009's G.I. JOE. Nolan also employs previous acquaintances Ken Watanabe and Cillian Murphy and brings in the talented (and cute) Ellen Paige. The show-stealer here is Tom Hardy as the team's smarmy forger Eames. Nolan again proves he has a knack for assembling a great cast and, if the past is any indication, we can expect to see him collaborate with them in future projects. As good as his cast is, the real star of this film would be the special effects. There is some seriously great effects in this film as Nolan takes full advantage of the dreamscape. Paris folding in upon itself, zero-gravity combat, and some spectacular landscapes populating Limbo...it's no surprise this film cost $160 million, but it looks great.You can tell Nolan put some serious time and thought into the complexity of the dreamscape inhabited by his characters. It's a blessing and a curse. It makes for a fuller, richer experience because the world seems legitimate with it's established rules, but the problem is we, as the audience, are subjected to extensive training to ensure we can follow what's going on. Ariadne (Page) is the team's new, inexperience architect. She acts as the receptor for all the new information the audience will need to follow the mission. The first half of the film is the team training Ariadne and explaining the physics behind the dream environments...the concept behind the 'kicks', the roles of each team member, the theory behind the totems, etc. So a lot of the dialogue for the first half of the film is just exposition, and it feels like it. It's the film's one weakness, and once it's through we get to enjoy the action-packed descent into the subconscious. A lot of people seem to have complained that the film is confusing and they have a hard time understanding Nolan's world, but honestly it's not that complicated if you actually pay attention. This was one of the best films of 2010 and proof that Nolan is one of the great modern filmmakers.",9,1,12,10 February 2011
Sherlock Holmes," Guy Ritchie's Interpretation of a Classic Hero
","Guy Ritchie has reinvented the famed literary sleuth for a new generation, abandoning some of the played-out clichés (such as the oft-quoted 'Elementary, my dear Watson') and amping up the energy with fast pacing and a handful of frenetic action sequences. I've seen a good amount of negativity on the web about this film (who knew there were so many Holmes fanboys out there...) but I really enjoyed it. I've been a fan of Ritchie since LOCK, STOCK, & TWO SMOKING BARRELS and while he's had a few weak projects, I thought this was one of his better. The story finds Watson preparing to move on from his sleuthing days and settle down for marriage, abandoning his partnership with the eccentric Holmes. Their final case together, in which the pair brought the mysterious Lord Blackwood to justice for practicing black magic and committing multiple murders, refuses to remain shut. After his hanging, Lord Blackwood was seen rising from the grave to torment London once again and it falls on Holmes and Watson to get to the bottom of Blackwood's scheme.Ritchie admits to having been a fan of Holmes since his childhood so I'm sure the man knows more on the subject than myself. I've only ever read one or two of Doyle's stories so I don't have the extensive knowledge on the character. All I know is that I enjoyed the movie, regardless of how well it followed the character's source material. People had shown distaste at the fact that Holmes is portrayed as an action hero in some scenes, rather than the pipe-smoking intellectual most people envision him as, but the original novels did in fact note Holmes hand-to-hand skills. Ritchie has just put them to good use. Keep in mind, despite what the trailers insinuate, this movie isn't what I'd call action-heavy. It has a few key action scenes but it does focus on Holmes and Watson solving the mystery behind Blackwood's supposed magic. This leads to my favorite aspect of the film: Ritchie's depiction of Holmes deductive process. He uses quick jump cuts to lead the audience down Holmes' thought processes and allows us to follow him (including how he uses these skills to determine the best process of incapacitating opponents).For the most part, the casting in this film was phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr is one of my favorite actors in recent years since his career revival and the man fails to disappoint me. I loved him in his role as the famed sleuth, giving him an amusing eccentric twist. He had great on-screen chemistry with Jude Law (as Watson) and the two gave the partners' relationship a modern bro-mantic vibe, as they squabbled like a couple of teenagers at times. Mark Strong gave an adequate performance as the villain Blackwood, though he really didn't have to do much outside brooding and speaking ominously. Still, despite his limited performance, he was still better than Rachel McAdams. McAdams plays Holmes old flame (and the only person to have outsmarted him...twice) Irene Adler, and she could not have stuck out any worse than she did. Her hammed performance yanked me right out of the movie whenever she was on-screen; what led Ritchie to cast her in the role is beyond me.The film blasts by and left me more than satisfied at the end. It was a fun popcorn flick with sharp writing and some great action. Despite McAdams bogging it down, SHERLOCK HOLMES is one of the better movies of 2009. Let the fanboys hate on this film for whatever reason but, as long as you watch it with an open mind and understand that the film serves as Guy Ritchie's interpretation of the character and doesn't need to be seen as the ultimate portrayal, it's a fun film and I can't wait for the inevitable sequel.",8,0,2,10 May 2010
Rango," One of the Best Animated Films I've Seen
","RANGO is one of the most entertaining films I've seen so far in 2011. Following in the footsteps of Dreamwork's SHREK franchise, RANGO is an animated film that's fun enough for kids but has enough elements that appeal to adult audiences that we can enjoy it too. At it's core, it's a simple fish-out-of-water premise where a lot of the humor is derived from a stranger's interactions in a new land he doesn't quite understand. RANGO goes a little deeper than your average kid flick, creating an interesting and somewhat complex character. RANGO is about an ordinary household pet chameleon en route down a desert highway with his owners when a freak occurrence drops him alone in the middle of nowhere. He stumbles his way a rundown little town named Dirt, where the inhabitants are in the middle of an ongoing drought. Seeing his chance to inhabit a new role, the chameleon adopts the name Rango and passes himself as one of the toughest sharpshooters to ever live. His big talk lands him in big trouble when he is brought on as Dirt's sheriff and it falls on him to discover where all the water's gone.Let me start by saying that I've noticed a lot of people trying to say this isn't for kids...that a few scattered, very mild profanities and some peril are too much for young minds. Well, my four-year-old daughter loves it and she enjoys the film without mimicking the little bit of questionable content there is. I took her to see it in the theater and she's made me watch it at least 20 times since we got it on DVD. The complex themes of identity and destiny pass right over her, but she loves it when the hawk gets its head stuck in a can. I personally love it for it's attempt at being more than your average kid's toon. It's got some great tripped out sequences as Rango wanders the desert coming to grips with his dilemma, including one where he finds the 'Spirit of the West'...a little nod towards the man who defined the gunslinger genre: Clint Eastwood driving a golf cart loaded with Oscars and voiced by star of HBO's DEADWOOD, Timothy Olyphant. There's also a funny nod in the beginning to Johnny Depp's friend and drugged out gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson. I was surprised that I was the only adult in the theater that caught it and got a good laugh from the homage to FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS.The animation in this film is amazing. It's probably the best CG I've seen in a film. The textures, the cinematography, the character movement...it's beautiful. The inhabitants of Dirt are caricatures of characters we've seen in countless Westerns before, and the character design is hilarious. The visuals are fantastic and ILM has proved they could give other animation studios a run for their money if they can continue putting out quality films like this. The film boasts an excellent voice cast with Johnny Depp (Rango), Isla Fisher, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Ray Winstone, and more. Ned Beatty is Dirt's corrupt tortoise mayor, playing the villain again after last year's stint as Lotso in TOY STORY 3. Bill Nighy arrives in the final act of the film to steal every scene he's 'in' as Rattlesnake Jake. I thought the man was awesome as Davy Jones in the PIRATES films, and he brings his evil to the coolest character in RANGO. My only problem with the film was that it felt a little too long and some of the drawn out parts could've been trimmed a bit to streamline the film. If you're looking for a film to watch with kids that won't bore you to tears or having you rolling your eyes, this is it.",9,1,1,24 August 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," I Absolutely Loved BIRDMAN; a New Personal Favorite
","I loved BIRDMAN. In the interest of saving space, I won't be referring to it with the extended subtitle: THE UNEXPECTED VIRTUE OF IGNORANCE. But, yeah, I loved this movie. After a few viewings, I've got no issue counting it among my all-time favorites. I know the movie has gained a reputation as being 'pretentious' (that adjective has been thrown around a lot) with its heart-on-its-sleeve art house style, but I don't see that. I just see an energetic film with some good laughs and emotional moments. The insane amount of planning that went into the film to create the illusion of having been done in a single take is just an added level of respect. Whether this movie was written with Michael Keaton in mind is outside my scope of knowledge, but the role is certainly perfect for him. Keaton stars in the film as Riggan Thomson, an actor best known for his series of BIRDMAN comic movies. Thomson is getting older and attempting to leave his former rubber-suit days behind him; to do so, he has put all of his hope and resources into a stage play where he hopes to salvage his legacy and leave his mark on the world of art. There are only three days left until the big opening night and everything that can do wrong is going wrong. As it all begins to fall apart, his mind starts to unravel and he finds himself tormented with hallucinations of his most iconic movie roleBirdman.Where to begin.? This movie really was phenomenal. It's got a nonstop energy to it. The camera is near constantly moving and scene transitions are accomplished by following a character to the next scene, as opposed to the usual editing. Gimmick or not, writer/director Alejandro González Iñárritu's choice to present the movie as one long uninterrupted take is impressive. You know it took an incredible level of choreography, long rehearsals, and multiple takes to pull it off so everyone on the cast and crew deserves major credit for it. The film injects an extra energy boost with its jazz drum soundtrack that plays over the duration. The movie just flies along and you can't help but caught up in it all. In this viewer's opinion, BIRDMAN is a piece of masterful filmmaking, adept at grabbing the audience's interest and not letting up until the credits roll two hours later. Technical end aside, BIRDMAN works as well as it does because of its incredible casting. At its core, I suppose the movie is equal parts black comedy and drama. There is definitely some serious material in here and a lot of the conflict comes from Riggan's family life but, no sooner than you are beaten down with a heart-wrenching father/daughter argument, you are right back into the comical insanity of Riggan's ongoing mental war with his alter ego or getting a kick out of Edward Norton's onstage antics as diva method actor that nearly brings the entire play to its knees.This is the best I've ever seen Michael Keaton on screen. Granted, the role seems an obvious fit for a man who became a superstar in part due to his role as Batman in 1989 and 1992. He's fantastic in BIRDMAN and can portray a descent into madness with the best of them. But I have to say, no matter what was happening on screen or how Keaton was playing it, I always saw him as Michael Keaton. He never quite disappeared into the role. Keaton definitely has a style to his performances and all of his usual quirks are on full display. This isn't to take anything away from his performance. He was still amazing. It was just as if I was watching an alternate history Michael Keaton biopic, starring himself. Edward Norton is a scene-stealer as Mike Shiner, a last minute replacement in Riggan's cast who lives and breaths theater. Shiner is the ultimate method actor. When his character is supposed to be drunk on gin, he demands to be drunk on real gin. His character featured in a love scene? Why not have sex on stage? He's a basket case but he sells tickets, and Riggan needs him. Shiner is such a problem that he crosses just about everyone on cast and crew at some point, only seeming to find a connection with Riggan's daughter Sam (Emma Stone). I'm actually surprised Stone didn't get more awards for her role in BIRDMAN. It's more intense than anything I'm accustomed to seeing her in. Sam is a recovering drug addict, fresh from rehab and working on her father's play in an effort to help her stay clean. She harbors resentment toward her celebrity father who was never really there for her, and she has an incredible scene in the middle of the movie where she tears into him for his obsession and just leaves you speechless.There are a myriad of reasons I could recommend BIRDMAN. It's scored some major awards and received loads of mainstream success, and it was all well deserved. It's a creative endeavor that most directors would've go out of their way for in modern film and it's pulled off with perfection. I love BIRDMAN and recommend it to anyone that hasn't yet had an opportunity to see it. Whether you find that you love or hate it, it's worth watching to see where you stand.",10,0,3,15 October 2015
The Big Short," One of the Best of 2015, from the Director of...ANCHORMAN?
","It's rare that a movie can confound me as much as THE BIG SHORT and still come out as one of my favorite movies of the year. This film is most likely befuddling for anyone not in the banking industry (as it was for me) but director Adam McKay gets bonus points for keeping it so consistently entertaining that I wasn't all that bothered by the onslaught of insider lingo. THE BIG SHORT is an important film. It brings to light all of the shady, underhanded dealings that led to the collapse of the American housing market in 2008 and it does so in a way that is both informative and entertaining. I mean, we all knew we'd been screwed over by the banks but I can't imagine many of us knew what exactly it was that had happened. McKay's film, based on the book of the same name from author Michael Lewis, follows a group of people that realized the housing market was heading for catastrophe and took a big chance on betting against it. It began with a man named Michael Burry (Christian Bale) who discovered the disturbing trend that would ultimately end in financial collapse and placed the first bet. Others soon caught on, including a hedge fund team run by Mark Baum (Steve Carell) who saw this as a chance to stab back at the big banks. And finally, the third team is a duo of young upstart investors who see their chance to win big.I've watched THE BIG SHORT a few times now and I'll admit, while I enjoy it just as much if not more each time, my understanding of the events never gets much clearer. McKay takes a chance with this film and leaves the authenticity in the dialogue, all but ensuring I'll never convince a friend to give this movie a chance. I guarantee five minutes into this movie with rants about mortgages, CDOs, and hedge funds will send most of them running the other direction. If I can convince them to stick around long enough, Margot Robbie will explain CDOs from the cozy confines of a bubble bath and, maybe, it might arouse their interest. It's a fun little trick McKay utilizes because he realizes 99% of the audience won't be able to follow the dense lingo of the banking industry. Instead, he uses cut-away celebrity explanations and fourth-wall-breaking narration to the audience to keep us in the loop. McKay even has one of the characters explain directly to the audience how the banking industry uses these complicated terms and acronyms to confuse outsiders and keep them from understanding what exactly it is the banks are doing. So don't feel bad if you walk away from this movie and still aren't sure what happened. But really it isn't all that hard to follow. Essentially the banks were so confident of the housing market and peoples' abilities to pay their mortgages that they viewed them as a means of easy profit.Obviously they were wrong. People became unable to pay their mortgages and, not only did the banks not notice where things were headed, they did little to nothing to prepare for potential catastrophe. There's a revealing moment late in the movie where Baum and his team attend an exhibition in Las Vegas and Baum, unable to believe that the banks could be so ridiculously stupid, flat out asks them about the disturbing trends. He's laughed off and we're led to understand that those in the banking industry were just that clueless. It's infuriating. And that brings me to the tone of THE BIG SHORT. McKay walks a fine line between funny and dramatic. Depressing and exciting. We're along for the ride with these outside-the-box thinkers on this gamble and, while we want them to succeed, we're also reminded of what their success will mean. Sure, they'll win big. Real big. But, as Brat Pitt's character reminds us when his investor protégées get a little too excited, this is Americans' livelihoods at stake. These men stand to win ridiculous sums of money but at a horrible cost. THE BIG SHORT ensures we remember this, and these characters aren't portrayed as heartless men (well, all right, maybe one of them). Each of them has a crisis of conscience when the big moment is looming. THE BIG SHORT is important because it takes a close look at one of the United States' biggest mistakes and McKay uses every trick in his filmmaking bag of tricks to make it a bearable experience that we can both enjoy and learn from. I mean, we wouldn't want this sort of thing to happen again. Except, as one of the closing title cards in the movie explains, it's already sort of starting down that path",9,0,0,23 November 2016
The Conjuring," A Well-Done Supernatural Thriller with Respect for the Genre
","I don't know. Maybe I'm just jaded but I wasn't all that frightened by director James Wan's 2013 hit, THE CONJURING. I'm a tough person to engage with a horror film or supernatural thriller because it really needs some special to grab my attention. I was never bored while watching THE CONJURING, and I was even a little creeped out by the end of it all, but there's just nothing here to raise this movie above any other supernatural ghost tale. It never quite reaches the entertainment value of Wan's previous ghost story, INSIDIOUS. This movie has the added bonus of being based on supposed actual events, if that helps increase the spook factor for you at all. It's about Ed and Lorraine Warren (portrayed in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), a famous husband/wife team of demonologists who've claim to fame include such cases as the Amityville House. Seeing as how Amityville has been done to death, this movie focuses on another of their cases: the Perrons. The Perron family begins experiencing unusual phenomena after moving into a little farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. When it becomes apparent that whatever spirit or spirits haunting their home are aggressive, the Perrons seek out the aid of the Warrens. The Warrens soon discover that the Perrons' new home has a dark past that continues to torture the inhabitants of the home, and they must gather enough evidence for the Vatican to agree to an exorcism before the evil can claim new victims.I suppose I respect THE CONJURING and enjoy it to the extent that I do because I understand what it's trying to be. James Wan isn't hoping to reinvent the wheel with this movie. Haunted house and possession movies are a dime a dozen anymore. Exorcism movies are the new 'big thing' with a handful of them creeping into theaters each year, and most of them bombing. With THE CONJURING, Wan just wants to create the best film of this genre that he can, using all of the tools (and a lot of jump scares) that have been established for this genre. In that regard, the movie is a success. It's one of the better haunted house/possession films I've seen in the past few years. It was successful in at least creeping me out by the end of the film but I wasn't as blown away as I'd expected. The movie is sort of a victim of it's own hype machine. All of the advertisements and a lot of the reviews promised THE CONJURING to be one of the scariest movies in years and, well, no. It's got some nice bits, especially an introduction to the move focused on another of the Warrens' cases: Annabelle, the doll. For whatever reason, busted porcelain dolls are inherently skin-crawling and one that supposedly stalks its victims is a guaranteed spook factor. The final act of the film with the big exorcism isall right. Again, it's nothing I don't feel like I haven't seen before and it's hard to get excited for it.The movie's biggest strength (aside from its director's obvious love/respect for the genre) is its cast. We've got Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren. Wilson is a man I'm surprised doesn't get more mainstream work. He's developed a nice history with James Wan, starring in both this and the INSIDIOUS films. Wilson's a great talent in the film and he's got strong chemistry with Vera Farmiga, who stars as his wife Lorraine Warren. Farmiga's another who brings a little class to the cast and these two starring together in the main roles brings the movie a little extra clout. Ron Livingston, one of Hollywood's best everymen, is Roger Perron, the head of the household who puts his family's life into the Warrens' hands even if he doesn't quite understand the situation they've found themselves embroiled in. The film also have the benefit of having child stars with decent talent. Child actors are an easy way to kill the fun but the girls who play the Perrons' children do a fantastic job. Everyone is bringing their A- game to the film and it never devolves into cheese. THE CONJURING works because everyone involved have a respect for the genre and unite in their aim to create a great modern ghost flick. And they do. Unless you're a naturally jumpy person, I wouldn't walk into THE CONJURING expecting the scare of your life but it is a well-done supernatural thriller with a handful of good, creepy moments.",7,1,2,7 February 2014
Platoon," A Powerful Vision of Vietnam from Oliver Stone
","PLATOON is a movie that didn't really impress me much when I first watched it, but I found that it grew on me after a few more viewings. I've never been into war movies but there's always been something about the Vietnam War that grabbed my interest. It didn't play out like a normal war. It was deep in the jungle and the soldiers that experienced it encountered more than your average wartime strain. The jungle is a beast all it's own and to find yourself battling in it's nightmare terrain where the enemy can and will come from all sides at any moment is terrifying. I love a good Vietnam War film, where the focus is on the experiences of the soldiers as opposed to achieving victory. APOCALYPSE NOW is one of my all-time favorite films period, and FULL METAL JACKET is an intense view of a soldier's life from boot camp through the horrors of the war. So when I sat down to watch PLATOON, my questions was: how well did Oliver Stone's vision of the war stand up to Coppola and Kubrick? PLATOON follows the experiences of one soldier, Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen), as he arrives in Vietnam. An idealistic college student, Chris believed it was everyone's duty, not just the poor, to do their part in the war. Once he arrives, he discovers that nobility doesn't even enter the picture. It's all about survival and the law of the jungle, and he's caught in the conflict between the gung-ho Sergeant Barnes and the liberal Sergeant Elias.I suppose my initial disappointment with the movie was all a result of personal biases. At first glance, the movie wasn't as visually impressive as Kubrick's 'Nam, and especially not Coppola's. Coppola had an incredible artistic vision when he created APOCALYPSE NOW. Every scene, every shot, every line of dialogue in that movie is powerful (in my personal opinion, anyway). And Kubrick's film was brutal in how it depicted the dehumanization of soldier's in the war. Oliver Stone's movie didn't feel as artistically influenced. It had an almost generic feel to the movie from the very beginning with the jungle-green opening credits over the shot of a passenger/cargo plane dropping a batch of fresh recruits in Vietnam. As I watched the film again, I found myself drawn into it's vision more and more. I still find Stone's vision less visually impressive than the others, but I am pulled in by the characters of the film (more than Kubrick's at times). PLATOON is an intense character piece where we experience the war through the eyes of someone going into a nightmare situation without knowing what to expect (just like the viewer). You sympathize with Chris and his comrades and feel the tension between the Elias and Barnes sides of the camp. You watch as Chris's idealism is slowly chipped away until there is nothing left but an almost feral nature and a code of honor when he seeks justice for one of his fallen friends.My second problem with the film on its first viewing was the main character. I hadn't seen this movie until very recently, after the whole public meltdown of Charlie Sheen in the media. So my image of Charlie Sheen is that of a bizarre tale of how celebrity life and eat your sanity. Watching him as a bright-eyed, optimistic private was a hard pill to swallow. I just couldn't buy into it. I eventually overcame my views on Sheen and actually believe he did a better job than I originally gave him credit for. He's still a little hard to buy in such a powerful dramatic role (I mean, he did do HOT SHOTS) but he puts in a good performance. No where near as good as his father in APOCALYPSE NOW, but a good job regardless. There are actually a lot of great performances hereKeith David, Kevin Dillon, Forest Whitaker, etc. I admit Dillon did feel a little over the top as Bunny, but he remained in the realm of plausibility. You believe him as a someone who was probably a small-town jock back home but gets to stretch his legs a bit and goes a little far with the freedom to act in Vietnam. Speaking of over-the-top though, no one fits the bill better than John C. McGinley as O'Neill. It's OK though, because I've come to expect him to ham it up. The real powerhouses in the film are Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger as Sergeants Elias and Barnes. These man are the real center of conflict in the picture. These two men have very different views on running the war in Vietnam and it's their head-butting and eventual confrontation that drives Private Taylor's final descent into total loss of innocence. It's truly a great story. Sure, I still don't believe it rises to the ranks of Coppola and Kubrick, but I definitely count this as one of the most iconic visions of Vietnam to come out of Hollywood.",8,3,4,18 April 2012
Prometheus," Plot Issues Aren't Enough to Detract from PROMETHEUS Overall Successes
","The original ALIEN is one of my all-time favorite movies. So it should be no surprise that I was super excited when I'd read that director Ridley Scott would be returning to the franchise for a prequel. Then the news came that Scott claimed it was no longer a prequel to ALIEN but claimed that it retained the same 'DNA' of the original film. OKwasn't sure what to make of the news but I remained excited regardless. It's Ridley Scott returning to science fiction; I was sold from the start. I can't say I was disappointed when I finally saw the finished product in theaters, but I was certainly confused. I knew I liked it but I was overrun with questions about what I'd seen. I started checking out reviews and getting a general consensus on what others felt and I wasn't alone: this movie left a lot of people baffled. Bizarre character decisions, confusing plot elements, and a black ooze that would apparently serve whatever purpose the script neededI was glad I wasn't the only one having trouble wrapping my head around it. The movie is set long before the crew of the NOSTROMO arrives to investigate a distress signal at LV-426. Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Marshall-Green) are archaeologists who believe they have discovered an invitation from an ancient race drawn on the walls of long-dead civilizations. Hoping they've discovered a message from a race of beings responsible for human evolution, they gain support from the infamous Weyland Corporation and embark on a mission with a corporate crew to investigate the possible origin of our species.Investigating the origin of our species and filling the movie with science vs. religion tones means you can expect some pretty heavy material. That is exactly what I want from my science fiction. The best science fiction films challenge the audience to rethink aspects of our society, in this case toying with the proposition that the human species is the result of alien intervention. And it was directed by Ridley Scott, whom most can agree has some incredible talent in terms of film and storytelling. So where did it go wrong? In my opinion, this is a pretty complicated answer. To start, the original ALIEN isn't so much science fiction as it was horror in a space setting. There were no grand questions or designs; it was an unstoppable killing force murdering the crew of a mining ship one at a time. PROMETHEUS attempts to be both. The first half of the film focuses on the science fiction elements and the second half shifts over to the horror we expected when Scott returned to the ALIEN franchise. As a result, the first half of the movie raises a lot of interesting questions and teases a few answers but the second half of the movie is when the mysterious black ooze takes over the plot and it becomes a stream of bizarre, horrible mutations and death. By the end of the movie, we've lost any chance of receiving the answers because it's suddenly about killing the crew and fulfilling the audience's blood-lust. I'm cool with that. I enjoy horror and I love science fiction. Just, you know, commit to one. Don't tease me with an intriguing story and leave me hanging.Despite it's problems, PROMETHEUS was still a good movie. Scott is a talented filmmaker with a great eye for visuals and this movie is a great example. PROMETHEUS is an amazing looking film with fantastic production design and beautiful cinematography. Everything in the film, from the design of the PROMETHEUS ship to the alien tech and the Engineers, looks amazing. The cast is full of incredible talent as well, with Charlize Theron, Michael Fassbender, Idris Elba, and Noomi Rapace (though Shaw is no Ellen Ripley) turning in great performances. The only casting misstep, and I'm sure you've probably read/heard about this elsewhere, was Guy Pearce as the 100+ year-old Charles Weyland. Pearce is a great actor but I've never cared for old age makeup effects and the ones in the film aren't the best. I kept imagining him as the 2015 version of Biff from BACK TO THE FUTURE. Needless to say, it pulled me out of the movie a bit. I've since seen the behind-the-scenes explanation about how Pearce came to the role (i.e. there were originally more scenes intended with a young Weyland and he was put in the makeup to match the character) but it's just a shame it turned out as it did.The abundance of loose ends is a bummer but the movie itself is still great entertainment. The visual effects are fantastic, the creature effects are on par with the original's, and the performances make up for most of the script issues. There has been some chatter about another movie or two following PROMETHEUS that might bring the answers I hoped expected by the end of the film and, if the next films maintain the quality of PROMETHEUS, it's safe to assume I'll be in line for them too.",8,1,7,16 January 2013
Back to the Future Part II," My Favorite Outing with Doc's DeLorean
","Ahh, yes. This film was probably my favorite installment of the 80's time-travel trilogy. Granted, I enjoyed more when I was younger but I still have a love for it now. I've always enjoyed this more than the other two films because of how much time-hopping we're treated to, with Zemeckis's vision of Hill Valley in 2015, an alternate 1985 in which Biff Tannen's a vile business mogul, and once again...1955. This film begins moments after the first film ended, with Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) returning from the future with a new and improved DeLorean to warn Marty (Michael J. Fox) and Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue, replacing Claudia Wells) about a future incident that ruins their son's life. Their trip brings about further problems when an elderly Biff (Thomas Wilson) discovers the time machine and uses it to make himself rich and powerful in the past.I'm always a bit confused when I read negative critic comments or poor reception for the film. As I understand, it confused audiences who weren't expecting a 'To Be Concluded' ending to the film and may have turned audiences off to it, but even as a standalone film, PART II is great fun. I love the future sequences, with a picturesque Hill Valley populated by flying cars, hover-boards, and the campy Cafe 80's. The production design on this movie is what really gets me every time. In addition, the ILM computer effects have aged rather well considering the film was made in 1989. You can still spot the computer effects but they're never bad enough to pull you out of the film.Bob Gale returns to write the screenplay and, as such, the film has the same fun sense of humor as PART I and the characters remain true to form. Fox, Lloyd, Wilson, and Lea Thompson (as Marty's mom, Lorraine) all return to their respective roles and Elisabeth Shue steps in for Claudia Wells as Marty's girlfriend (though her part is limited in the film). All-in-all, this film is a classic staple of the 80's and it's fun enough that anyone and everyone could enjoy it. It's right up there with PART I as great 80's popcorn fun while PART III didn't carry on with the same feel. If by some chance you haven't seen Zemeckis's series (what's wrong with you?!), do yourself a favor and pick 'em up...especially PART II.",8,0,0,19 October 2009
1408," A Strong Adaptation of a Stephen King Short Story
","It's been a good while since I've read the short story 1408 was based on, but I don't remember it being more than a few pages. Yet, the writers were able to adapt the minor amount of source material into a surprisingly effective PG-13 thriller. In the film, a disillusioned author who researches haunted locations for his book series decides to spend a night in the Dolphin Hotel's haunted room #1408, where fifty-six visitors had died of various strange circumstances. The film hits a few speed bumps but manages to be a thoroughly entertaining supernatural thriller.It's seems to be a widely recognized notion that films based on the works of Stephen King are hit (THE GREEN MILE) or miss (DREAMCATCHER). 1408 is a hit; it's a thriller that doesn't rely on gore effects or slasher techniques to create tension. There are a handful of cheap 'boo' moments but they aren't overused. The film stars John Cusack as Mike Enslin, the main character tormented by the room's evil, and the majority of the film is Cusack alone. Cusack's a great actor and, despite rarely having anyone to work off of other than his pocket recorder, does an awesome job. The film also boasts the ever-cool Samuel L. Jackson as Gerald Olin, the Dolphin's manager who does his best to warn Cusack to no avail.The film starts strong and the first hour keeps the pace, baiting Cusack and the audience along with increasingly strange occurrences. Towards the end of the second act, the film grinds to a crawl with psych-out that goes on a bit too long and caused me to lose interest while I waited for the next big development in the story. Thankfully, it picks up in time for a decent conclusion (I personally prefer the theatrical ending over the director's cut). 1408 is entertaining spin on the usual 'haunted house' motif and, despite it's PG-13 rating, delivers the tension and creep-outs to create a fun thriller.",8,0,0,21 December 2009
Straight Outta Compton," A Solid (but Over-Long) Music Biopic on the Origins of N.W.A.
","N.W.A. hit it big with 'Straight Outta Compton' in 1988. I was only about four-years- old at the time and, by the time rap music fell on my radar, I was in high school and, with a few exceptions in that era, I wrote the genre off as something I wasn't interested in. I was a classic rock kid. Sue me. Anyway, modern rap hasn't done anything to change that but I have gone back to check out some of the earlier stuff I'd missed thanks to STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON and realized I might've been a little hasty in dismissing an entire genre of music. That's how I know this movie is good; it was able to ignite a respect for something I previously couldn't be bothered to care about. It was the same with Ron Howard's RUSH in 2013. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, from director F. Gary Gray, details the meteoric rise and eventual divide of West Coast rap phenomenon N.W.A. Aspiring artists Dr. Dre (Corey Hawkins), Ice Cube (O'Shea Jackson Jr.), MC Ren (Aldis Hodge), and DJ Yella (Neil Brown Jr.) band together with their friend Eazy-E (Jason Mitchell), who's developed business acumen from his time as a dope dealer in Compton, to bring a message to the people that they're tired of the oppression and abuse of power from local law enforcement on the black communities. We see the power behind their music inspire a generation of people to rise against their oppressors, while at the same time shady dealings between Eazy-E and their manager Jerry Heller (Paul Giamiatti) lead to fractures between them.N.W.A. was a five man team but STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON seems to focus on the three key players: Dre, Cube, and Eazy-E. If you're a fan of MC Ren or DJ Yella, I'm sorry to tell you but they're essentially background players in the scheme of the movie. At least Ren steps up as N.W.A.'s main writer once Cube goes solo, but Yella doesn't get a whole lot to do. As long as that doesn't cause you too much grief, you're in for some amazing performances from Hawkins, Jackson, and Mitchell. Hawkins gets some meaty material for Dre as a man dedicated to his craft and determined to be successful, and Jackson (real life son to Ice Cube) is spot on as an angry artist and the only member of N.W.A. with the gumption to call out Eazy-E and Heller for ripping them off. But, in the end, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is Mitchell's movie. Eazy-E is the most compelling character in the roster and Mitchell is given the most engaging character arc in the film. Eazy-E goes from street-smart dope dealer to millionaire, stepping on the backs of friends to get there, and comes to realize what he's sacrificed for success. Mitchell is a scene-stealer and, despite the way he cheats his friends, he's one of the most sympathetic characters in the movie. The character is complex and, as someone I'd never seen act before, Mitchell nails it. Even Giamatti pales in comparison as the group's self-serving manager, a man I can't pin down as genuinely evil or just playing the crooked music industry games.The story behind the rise of N.W.A. is a pretty awesome one. Seeing as how most of the members are still alive and probably had a certain light they insisted on being painted in, you'll know you aren't getting the full story but, at two and a half hours long, you're still getting plenty. The movie covers what are, I figure, the more important points. We get key moments in the studio, including a reluctant Eazy-E's recording of 'Boyz-n-the-Hood' line by line and the birth of 'F**k the Police' after the guys are harassed by some cops outside the recording studio. We see the rise of hard core rap and the effect it had on the populace, surely contributing to the outrage of police harassment and abuse. The movie focuses primarily on the Rodney King event and the following riots in Los Angeles where the guys saw their dire warnings come true as the oppressed fought back. The movie also manages to stuff in scenes with appearances from Snoop Dogg and Tupac so fans will have something to nudge their friends and point at the screen about. One of the better story elements in the movie comes in the form of Suge Knight (R. Marcos Taylor) when he poaches Dre over to Death Row Records; Taylor has an intimidating presence and can pull off crazy eyes that'll stop anyone in their tracks. The last half hour or so starts to drag when the movie starts going down Eazy-E's redemption path and introduces his AIDS but that first two hours is pretty solid. STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON is a movie I never thought I'd love but there you have it. It's even got me listening to some of the early west coast rap to have come out of the era. And if that's probably the best compliment I could give the movie.",8,6,24,15 October 2016
The Silence of the Lambs," A Masterpiece of a Psychological Thriller
","Jonathan Demme's 1991 film is one of my all-time favorite movies, and it's one of the reasons that drove me to study film-making. It's an intense psychological thriller with a phenomenal cast and some of the most memorable characters/scenes in cinema. Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the film follows Clarice Starling, an FBI trainee who has been pulled on to assist in a case by the head of the FBI Behavioral Sciences division. Starling must interview incarcerated serial killer Hannibal Lecter in an attempt to help capture a new killer who has risen up and killed three women for their skin. Of course, this movie is legendary, so I'm sure everyone knows this much already...Demme's film, while not the first to feature the character of Hannibal Lecter, is what turned the psychopath into one of the greatest movie villains ever created. Most of the credit for this can be attributed to Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the evil genius. The character is charismatic and frightening, all at the same time, so you can't help but like him despite the terrible things he's done. Lecter is a film icon due to Hopkins' performance. The best scenes in the film are any that include conversations between Lecter and Starling (Jodie Foster). They make every other scene in the movie (including the primary plot) seem insignificant and I found myself waiting for the next interview scene. Foster was great as the naive FBI agent-in-training who is thrown into the fire for her first real assignment and Scott Glenn gave a strong performance Jack Crawford, head of Behavioral Sciences. Aside from Hopkins, I'd have to say the best performance came from Ted Levine as Jame 'Buffalo Bill' Gumb. Perhaps I am just easily entertained by sociopaths but watching him as the severely disturbed Gumb still gives me the creeps.I wouldn't say I was ever really scared by this movie, so I wouldn't classify it as horror. It was more a sense of uneasiness from the film's two resident psychos: Hopkins and Levine. It gives you a minor glimpse of the mind of a serial killer and it does it effectively, thanks to the writings of Thomas Harris and Ted Tally. Despite having been released in 1991, the film is timeless and continues to stand today as one of the best movies I've ever seen. Honestly, if you're reading this and haven't seen this film, do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.",10,1,1,21 September 2008
X-Men: First Class," Finally, Another Great X-Film!
","We haven't had a good X-Men film since Bryan Singer left the franchise, and I was ready to give up hope on the whole deal after that Wolverine catastrophe. Word of development on a prequel arrived and all I could think was, 'This isn't going to end well.' Even with director Matthew Vaughn attached, I couldn't get excited. The trailer grabbed my attention but did nothing to quell my fears. I mean, another origin story (strike one) with teenage characters (strike 2) and only one member of the original comic line-up? How could this possibly end in anything but cinematic disaster? Well, I was wrong to doubt Vaughn and this movie quickly became one of my favorite movies of 2011. The film is set in the early 60s and establishes the friendship of Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr. Former Nazi and current head of the Hellfire Club Sebastian Shaw is involved with both the United States and Russia with plans of pushing the global superpowers towards nuclear war. Xavier is recruited by the C.I.A. to assemble a team of mutants to combat Shaw and his team of mutant henchmen, while Lehnsherr has plans of his own. He and Shaw have a history going back to young Lehnsherr's imprisonment in a concentration camp during World War II where Shaw killed his mother, and Lehnsherr wants revenge.Sadly, Fox has an established movie canon for the X-Men series so they weren't able to use the original comic team (Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast, Iceman, and Angel) and instead we're left with sort of an X-Men B-team with a handful of characters that probably wouldn't have been more than a cameo in any other X-film. Hank McCoy/Beast is the only member of the original team who makes it into the film and, while Nicholas Hoult did a fine job as the socially awkward scientist on a personal mission to rid himself of his visible deformities, it's the actual appearance of Beast that doesn't sit too well with me. The Beast effects in THE LAST STAND were actually pretty cool in my opinion and probably the best we'd get without going CG. In FIRST CLASS, Beast looks like someone took an old-fashioned Wolfman costume and soaked it in blue dye. I eventually got over it, but it was a bit of a distraction. The rest of the team is filled out with Banshee, Angel (not the original Angel, but actually Tempest from a later X-Men comic series), Havok, Mystique, and Darwin. You can see they were reaching a bit when finding characters to fill out their movie, but the team comes together better than I expected. The fact that we've got a younger team does lead to some corny moments; the scene in which the team assigns themselves their 'codenames' feels forced, but I guess it had to happen if we want to start recognizing them as Havok, Banshee, and Angel instead of Alex, Sean, anduhAngel.The big three in this film are James McAvoy (Xavier), Michael Fassbender (Lehnsherr), and Kevin Bacon (Shaw). McAvoy and Fassbender didn't necessarily try to mimic the performances of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan from the original trilogy. These characters really feel as if the actors tried to make it their own, but it worked out so well that it feels as if they'd later develop into the Stewart/McKellan incarnations. Since this film really focuses on Xavier and Lehnsherr, it's important that the two had such great chemistry as it depicts the strength of their relationship and how their views on mutant/human relations eventually drove them apart. And Kevin Bacon continues the comeback he started in the wicked indie superhero-wannabe film SUPER. Bacon is awesome as Shaw. He just makes a great villain; he knows how to play evil and he comes across as so cool that it's hard to totally hate the man. It just sucks his team didn't live up to his level. January Jones is bland as Emma Frost, and both Azazel and Riptide (I actually had to check the credits to find this character's name) are nothing more than muscle with no development. I really hope Azazel gets some more attention in future films.I was surprised this film didn't do better at the box office. It was easily the best superhero movie of 2011 but it couldn't make the same cash as the other 2011 Marvel films. I loved how this film focused just as much on the characters as it did the action. There's plenty of great action in the movie, but we also get a great balance of scenes with the characters themselves: training the team, strengthening the Xavier/Lehnsherr bond, etc. Even with so much attention paid to the story, this movie never slows down and the 60s atmosphere gave the film a retro vibe that I couldn't get enough of. It's a lot of fun and I can honestly say I think it's at least as good as X2, possibly better. Matthew Vaughn has done what I'd begun thinking was impossible: creating an awesome new X-Men film.",9,1,4,28 September 2011
The Wolverine," So Much Better Than X-MEN: ORIGINS
","After the utter disappointment of X-MEN ORIGINS, I was less than thrilled for a new solo adventure for Marvel's adamantium-clawed mutant. The shoddy plot, cable television level CG, and blatant abuse of Deadpool/Wade Wilson still leave a bad taste in my mouth five years after it was dumped into theaters. Fox hasn't got the greatest track record with its comic properties, with it's disappointments leaving a stronger impression than its successes. I never read the Chris Claremont/Frank Miller Japan story arc in the Wolverine comics, and the only James Mangold films I've ever seen were IDENTITY and WALK THE LINE (which were good, but didn't exactly imply he had the mindset for a comic book film). To simplify, I had no real draw to this film other than an ongoing hope that it just had to be better than the last Wolverine film. And, wow, it was. THE WOLVERINE is set a while after the events of THE LAST STAND. Logan is living off the grid, sleeping in the woods with only a radio and his nightmares to keep him company. He is found by a young Japanese woman, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who insists he accompany her to Japan. There is a man from Logan's past on his deathbed and wishes to say goodbye to the mutant who once saved his life. The man, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), offers Logan an opportunity for freedom from the pain of his immortal life. No longer would he have to live on as those he loves die around him. He turns him down, the old man dies, and that's when Logan's problems truly begin. He loses his healing abilities and is forced on the run to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), while at the same time trying to discover who's behind it.I actually really enjoyed THE WOLVERINE. It's a lot better than I anticipated, especially if you catch the unrated version that was released on home video. It's your fix for all the brutal Wolverine action our lives have been missing in the PG-13 X-MEN film universe. Without the rest of the X-Men around to bother him with those pesky morals, Logan gets to cut loose (no pun intended). He's not going up against a bunch of mutants this time with super strength or high endurance. He's (mostly) going against regular humans who crumple under the assault of his adamantium claws and animalistic rage. The loss of his mutant healing abilities add a nice touch to the film too. The biggest problem with a character such as Wolverine is that he's never truly in danger. There's not much that anyone can do to him that he wouldn't recover from and soon proceed to eviscerate them. Without his healing abilities, he's finally at risk, and so is Mariko. Mariko's being hunted by the Yakuza following her grandfather's death and Logan makes it his mission to protect her. This leads to some nice character moments as Logan allows himself to get close to someone for the first real time since the death of Jean Grey, a death that continues to haunt him. THE WOLVERINE is just as much a character piece as it is a comic book/action film. We still get loads of Wolverine action but it's interspersed with chances to develop his character in regards to his budding romance with Mariko and his friendship with the beautiful Yukio. Rila Fukushima is probably my favorite part of the entire film. Her character Yukio is an exotic beauty and a masterful fighter in both hand-to-hand combat and katanas. Plus, she's a mutant because it was necessary for some interesting plot foreshadowing (and literally nothing else).THE WOLVERINE is not without it's flaws though. The movie drags on a little in the midsection when the bulk of the character development is placed. I didn't mind it too much but it was enough of a lull that my buddy actually fell asleep in the theater for a few minutes at that point. Honestly, it's not that bothersome. I was more turned off by the character of Viper. It just wouldn't be an X-Men film if there wasn't at least one character shoe-horned in to fill out the mutant quota. Oh yeah, she's a mutant in the movie too (while he character in the comics wasn't) and, as I understand it, she had nothing to do with the Japanese story arc. She's just here because they wanted a mid-level mutant villain. I don't care much for her inclusion in the movie and Svetlana Khodchenkova doesn't do much but chew scenery, giving no real depth other than being evil. Wasteful.I love that the majority of the movie is a more toned down, character-centric film that the other comic movies out there but it all devolves into the usual sci- fi/fantasy/action stuff. Big baddie, lot's of fighting, epic conclusionall that stuff. Also, I've got to say I saw all the major plot points coming a mile away. I knew who was behind most the evil-doings just from having seen the trailers. Still, it wasn't enough to taint the experience. I was pleasantly surprised by THE WOLVERINE and I forgive Fox for the mess that was X-MEN ORIGINS. While I wouldn't rank it up there with my favorite comic book movies, it was still a great entry in the X-Men cinematic universe and proof that Logan/Hugh Jackman are still going strong.",8,1,2,4 April 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A Perfect Finale for Nolan's Batman Saga
","And Christopher Nolan's genre-changing series of Batman films finally comes to a close with THE DARK KNIGHT RISES. No matter what your opinions are of Nolan's Batman movies, you have to admit that they've had an effect on latest generation of superhero movies to arrive in theaters. With his trilogy finally complete and the all those involved moving on to other projects, I'll be curious to see where the comic book movie genre goes next. When I first saw THE DARK KNIGHT RISES in theaters (a midnight showing, of course, and one of the few I've attended), I admit I was initially disappointed but additional viewings have helped me appreciate it a lot more. The movie is set eight years following the events of THE DARK KNIGHT with Batman going on the run and the true details of Harvey Dent's death buried in hopes of using him as Gotham's shining hero. The city has enjoyed a time of peace as crime is at an all-time low, but this is all about to change. A terrorist named Bane has his sights set on Gotham. He arises under the guise as a freedom fighter with the goal of bringing the upper class to their knees while the lower class are allowed to rise to power, but Bane is no hero. Bruce Wayne returns to don the costume and investigate Bane but his time away from crime fighting has left him weakened. His initial confrontation with Bane leaves him broken, and Wayne must find the strength to return and, with help from a professional cat burglar, save Gotham from total destruction.To put my views in perspective, I am a Nolan fan and I love his Batman movies. THE DARK KNIGHT is one of my favorite movies and I loved BATMAN BEGINS so much that it was one of the few movies I shelled out cash to see in theaters multiple times. So yes, my views are a little skewed toward the positive side. But my initial impressions of the final movie weren't as generous. It was a fine movie, sure, but it failed to live up to the immense hype I'd built in my own mind prior to seeing the movie. I knew Nolan would have a hard time topping THE DARK KNIGHT and I accepted this. I also reminded myself that Nolan's Batman universe isn't exactly the same as that of the comics and details were going to be fudged to make them fit in the overarching story he was attempting to tell. With a near 3 hour runtime, I was in no mood to humor these factors when I saw it in theaters and I walked away befuddled with my issues with the movie. It was slower paced, Wayne doesn't don the costume enough in the movie, and the finale was anticlimactic. But, over time and two more viewings on my own, I realize that this movie was a lot better than I was giving it credit for. Sure, there are still some plot issues I'm not a fan of but I remind myself that this is Nolan's Batman and any problems I have will probably be retcon'd in the next Batman reboot anyway. Just enjoy the Nolan series for what it is. And I do.At a second glance, there is a lot about this movie I really like. Tom Hardy as Bane is just awesome. His bizarre voice took a minute to become acclimated with; it reminded me of Sean Connery talking through a tin can. Once I got used to his voice, Bane rose to become one of the best Batman villains that have been put to film yet, though not as remarkable as Heath Ledger's Joker (but, seriously, I don't see anyone topping that anytime soon). He is massive, intimidating presence and a perfect challenge for a Batman who's fallen into disrepair. What better motivation to rise than a madman with an insidious plan and the muscle to pound our hero into dust? On a related note, Anne Hathaway was an excellent choice for Catwoman/Selina Kyle. I was concerned at his casting at the beginning, but then I was just as concerned when Ledger was announced as Joker and my fears were proved unjustified when I saw his final performance. Hathaway does just as well; a cool manipulatorshe's beautiful but her sexiness isn't flaunted as it was in Burton's BATMAN RETURNS. I've also come to appreciate the overall plot of the film as an excellent finish to the series. It touches back on elements introduced in the first two movies and ties everything together nicely; you might almost assume Nolan had this planned from the start. I'm pretty sure he didn't, but it worked out great. The end has been caused for endless debate and complaints but, as long as I view it as an isolated Batman tale set in Nolan's own universe with no long-standing effect on the future Batman movies, I'm cool with it. I actually think it's a perfect end for the story Nolan has been building since 2005.",9,9,16,4 February 2013
Iron Man," Marvel & Favreau Do It Right
","Marvel's first self-financed film is the best comic adaptation to come from their stable of characters (so far). It manages to stay true to the feel of the comics, the characters, and the style. It was easily one of my top favorite movies of 2008 and Jon Favreau was a fantastic choice to direct this film. You can tell the man is a fan of the comics with as much detail and love of the subject matter as apparent in the film. For the uninitiated, the film revolves around billionaire industrialist Tony Stark and his decision to turn from weapons manufacturer to 'superhero' after an encounter in Afghanistan leaves him injured but inspired. He dons a high-tech battle-suit to become Iron Man and undo the damage his weapons have caused.Every aspect of this film was near perfect. Before the film had even been released, I knew the cast was ideal. Robert Downey Jr. was awesome as Stark and embodied the character perfectly. His performance helps keep the film entertaining, even when Stark isn't suited up and ready for battle. The supporting cast was just as strong, with Gywneth Paltrow as Stark's personal assistant Pepper Potts and Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend/confidant (and soon-to-be War Machine) James Rhodes. I also loved the casting of Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner Obadiah Stane; it was interesting to see the man who will forever be The Dude playing such an ominous role.One thing I loved most about this film was that it didn't play out like the typical comic book adaptation. The hero didn't spend the majority of the film battling the antagonist. In fact, Stark doesn't even his completed Mark III armor until about halfway through the film. The fun is in watching him develop and test the suit as the film progresses until he reaches his final product; though once it's ready, that's when the REAL fun begins. The CGI is seamless and blends well enough with all of the practical effects; it all feels real and is done beautifully.Marvel proves that it has what it takes to create it's own movies and, as a result, can do them properly. If Favreau's film is any indication of the level of quality we can expect from Marvel films in the future, this will be awesome; Louis Letterier's Hulk film, while not as strong as Favreau's film, was still a fantastic movie. I can easily recommend this movie to just about anyone, comic fans or not, because the subject matter and the performances are universally enjoyable.",9,1,2,30 October 2008
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," If You're Going to Watch It, Go with the Ultimate Edition. It's Slightly Better.
","There is enough discussion to be had about BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE that it can't possibly be donewelljustice in the limited space here. I was eager to discuss this slow-motion train wreck after leaving the theater in the spring of '16 but my friends were less interested in blowing their cash on a movie that garnered a discouraging 27% on Rotten Tomatoes than I was. After Marvel Studios built a multi-billion enterprise with their comic properties, DC finally realized they were falling behind and there was a load of money yet to be made with their immense stable of characters. Until this point, the only DC characters to be gifted with decent blockbuster films had been Batman and Superman. I mean, this one is still basically just Batman and Superman, but this one is Batman and Superman on screen *at the same time*! It also serves as the jumping off point for DC's dive into their full-blown JUSTICE LEAGUE. Unfortunately, whereas Marvel had the sense to ease each of their less mainstream characters into the public consciousness with individual films for Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, etc. so people less familiar would have some footing before we were given THE AVENGERS, DC decided to catch up on lost time by jumping in head first with this confusing mess of a film where director Zack Snyder and writers Chris Terrio & David Goyer had to accomplish a *lot* in a limited time.DAWN OF JUSTICE had the complex mission of: (1) introducing a new Batman to audiences (Ben Affleck), (2) introducing a new Lex Luthor to audiences (Jesse Eisenberg), (3) establishing a reason general audiences would accept for Batman to even fight Superman, (4) shoehorning an introduction to Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) into the film, and (5) setting up the creation of the Justice League This would be a lot for any filmmaker to tackle and, in this case, that director is Zack Snyder. He's a man known for his prioritizing of style over substance and, while I've enjoyed his other movies, I couldn't help but feel he was in a little over his head. There was so much jammed into this movie that, when it was cut down to a bloated 150 minutes for the theatrical release, it made almost no sense. Since then I've only ever watched the three hour extended director's cut and I recommend that anyone who hasn't seen the movie and might be curious do the same. It's still bloated and there's still pacing issues and there are still some character decisions that don't make the best of sense but at least the plot is all there and you aren't left with a dozen questions. The much-maligned plot device revolving around our heroes' mothers is still there and still lamethere's not avoiding thatbut the rest of it works a little better. And because the extended edition is R-rated, you can watch Batman murder in even more brutal fashion.Yeah, Batman murders a lot in this movie. That's just where we're at now. The Batman of DAWN OF JUSTICE is an old, grizzled, cynical Batman who seems tired of fighting crime and watching it have little to no effect, so now he's strapped an enormous machine gun to the front of the Batmobile and he has no qualms with snapping necks or sending criminals to prison with a Bat- branding that guarantees they'll be murdered inside. For that matter, why are so many other criminals in prison so eager to do Batman's dirty work? Aren't they operating on opposite teams? Anyway, Batman's a killer but the good news is Ben Affleck actually makes for a pretty cool Batman. All those years Kevin Smith said his buddy Affleck should be Batman, and he was right. I dig it and I really hope we get a solo Batman movie with Affleck sooner rather than later. Other new additions Eisenberg and Gadot don't fare as well. I love Jesse Eisenberg but I still have a hard time accepting his new eccentric, high- energy spastic Lex Luthor. He enters this movie with a pre-loaded hatred for Superman as if we're just supposed to understand he hates Superman because we, the audience, understand that these characters are enemies because that's what they've always been. How about a little background to explain Luthor's burning hatred for Superman? DAWN OF JUSTICE gives us some half-baked excuse of Luthor hating Superman's god-like status, but why wouldn't he have tried reaching out to Superman first to manipulate him into benefiting his own enterprises? Then maybe Superman turns him down and tells him his practices are less than virtuous and warn him to watch himself before he has to step in, and *then* Luthor feels the need to get him out of the way. Or something. I don't know. I wasn't paid millions of dollars to write this thing but I bet I couldn't done better than 'Grrr, he's like a god and I hate that and I'm willing to destroy anyone and everyone to make him gone.'A quick note about Gal Gadot, our new Wonder Woman, before I run out of space (I could go one so much longer with this movie. I wasn't kidding). I was not a fan of Gadot's Wonder Woman in this movie. I had a hard time at first getting through her accent and her line delivery wasn't the strongest. But I've since seen the 2017 solo WONDER WOMAN movie and I couldn't imagine a better choice. When she has more than five lines of dialogue, it's much easier to acclimate to her accent and she can, in fact, act. So Wonder Woman's weak entry into the DC cinematic universe is probably another fault of Snyder, Terrio, and Goyer. She's good and, for the record, WONDER WOMAN is so much stronger than this movie. Running out of spaceuhJimmy Olsen's meaningless existenceuhnonsensical, overly complex conspiracy plot umgeez three hours, really?! Hmmthat final battle anduhuhm Martha!",6,0,3,4 July 2017
Casino Royale," An absolute MUST for all 007 Fans...
","I have been a fan of the 007 films for a while and I've seen all but two of the films in the series, so when this film was released and appeared to differ pretty drastically from what I was used to I was a bit leery. I couldn't have more wrong, as this is easily my favorite Bond film to date. The studio has given James Bond a reboot, starting the series fresh with a new actor and new tone. The movie starts with Bond receiving his 00-status within MI6 and begins with his first mission as 007. The short version: He has been assigned to a case in which a man known only as Le Chiffre is partaking in a poker tournament in an effort to fund terrorist acts.Of course, that is a major understatement of the plot, as it is MUCH more complex. While most previous Bond film story lines could've been summed up in one sentence (i.e. evil organization/madman attempts to start World War III), this film's plot is complex and keeps you wondering to the end as to who can be trusted. There were some aspects I missed on my first viewing that were made clear the second time around. In addition to the great storytelling, we also get some of the best brutal action scenes from any Bond film. The fist-fights are brutal and the action never goes over-the-top, as it has in the past. We also don't have any of the signature gadgets that Bond fans have become accustomed to (with the exception of some additions to Bond's new Aston Martin). While this all leads to a completely different feel than any of the previous films, I loved it! It is grounded in reality without the campiness that has come to be expected; it seems to have more in common with the Bourne films than the previous Bond films.When I had heard Daniel Craig was to assume the role of Bond in this film, I was not one of the nay-sayers. I had seen him in 'Layer Cake' and thought he was a perfectly viable option. I was right, because he was fantastic. He was grittier but managed to keep up Bond's usual suave demeanor with a hint of humor. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd, the film's 'Bond Girl', an agent of the British Treasury sent along to fund Bond's mission in the tournament. She easily qualifies as one of my favorite Bond Girls, both beautiful and talented. The film was also backed with a fine supporting cast as well (Giancarlo Giannini, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffrey Wright, and, of course, Judi Dench).This film gave the Bond franchise a refreshing reboot that has probably saved it from degenerating into camp-inspired doom. Craig proves himself as a more-than-capable Bond and the film is grounded/realistic for the first time in years. While the movie is longer than most Bond films, it is entertaining throughout and leaves you craving the sequel by the end.",10,1,2,12 November 2008
Toy Story 3," One of the Best Animated Films Ever
","With the final release of the third installment in the TOY STORY series, Pixar has officially created one of the best movie trilogies ever. The franchise is one of the few that got consecutively better with each movie released. It's got all the fun of the previous films but the third has a bit of a darker turn as the toys are faced with the realization that they're no longer needed in Andy's life. Andy's all grown up and he's getting ready to leave for college. Woody has been selected to travel with him but the others are being relegated to the attic. An accident finds the toys at the curb for trash collection so they escape and climb into a box for donation at the local daycare. The idea of endless days filled with playtime is appealing and the toys at the daycare welcome them with open arms but things are not all what they seem. Andy's toys are left in the toddler room where they're ravaged by the kids and they soon discover the place is run like a prison by a lovable bear known as Lotso (short for Lots'o'Huggin Bear) and it's up to Woody to help his friends break out.This film has a darker edge than the previous two, and the villainous Lotso (voiced by Ned Beatty) seems especially evil. He comes across as a loving grandfather figure but he rules the daycare with an iron fist and a handful of minions, the funniest of which is Ken. Voiced by Michael Keaton, Ken is hilarious and a major scene-stealer as he has a hard time figuring why his love for fashion and pink dream-house make him a 'girl's toy'. Lotso and Ken are just two of the new additions to the film, with a load of other new characters. There is plenty to love about this new film and the characters are just one element.The film is still a children's movie but it's geared even more towards adults than the first two. There are definitely more adult themes and tense moments than before, but nothing too frightening for little ones. It's everything you love about TOY STORY with an even better story and dozens more characters. The best in the series, easily.",10,0,0,9 December 2010
Trainspotting," I Can See Why TRAINSPOTTING is a Modern Classic
","I've found that, the more I watch Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING, the more I enjoy it. I'll admit that I wasn't blown away when I first watched it, but I imagine that's because it became a victim of its own hype. Boyle's sophomore directing effort has got a major cult following and I've heard plenty of praise from some of my more film- obsessed friends. I didn't actually see it until a month or so ago and, while I enjoyed it, I wasn't sure why it was such a big deal. So I gave it some time to sink in, then went back and rewatched it again recently and fared a little better. Maybe it was the thick Scottish accents making dialogue difficult to follow at times or the retro nineties vibe, but it didn't sit well originally and a second viewing let me get past all that and enjoy it. TRAINSPOTTING follows some Edinburgh hood-rats living the junkie life and going where it takes them. There's Renton (Ewan McGregor), persistently on the verge of going clean and giving up his hedonist lifestyle; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a schemer and troublemaker with an encyclopedic knowledge of 007; Spud (Ewen Bremner), dopey and loyal to his mates; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), the smart one who seems capable of maintaining a (mostly) mature relationship and knows enough to keep away from the heroin habit his friends have sunken into; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a drunken psychopath who abhors his friends' love for heroin but doesn't mind putting a glass mug through some poor random pub patron's face.Poor Ewan McGregor. The first thought that comes to mind when his name is mentioned is the unfortunate STAR WARS prequels, foregoing the fact that the man obviously has loads more talent. His character, Renton, is the film's closest thing to a protagonist. We follow him from the depths of addiction through the struggle of going clean and trying to lead a normal life. Sure, he makes some stupid choices over the course of the film but you can't help but cheer him on. The kid's got charisma. Most of them do actually, despite being somewhat despicable human beings. I found myself feeling sort of sorry for Spud. He didn't strike me as the sharpest knife in the drawer but he was loyal to a fault. He was the only one in the crew that didn't seem to have an ounce of trouble in him (that wasn't injected intravenously anyway). Begbie's a royal trip. Carlyle is absolutely great, when you can understand him. I needed subtitles at times to get through the thick Scot accent but he was funniest part of the movie. The man's a powder keg and it doesn't take much to light his fuse. Sure, he hates heroin and gives his friends (rightfully) a hard time for their addiction but he's got more than enough flaws himself. He's violent, over-confidant, and possibly compensating for something. Sick Boy's the bad apple in the bunch. He's a man who relishes the junkie life and has little regard for those around him. And, finally, there's Tommy. Tommy doesn't fit well within the rest of the crew, as he seems to have some humanity in him. Tommy's character in the movie seems to exist solely to remind the audience that, as funny as the movie may be at times, heroin addiction is no joke and he serves as an example in his fall from 'normal' to, well, that'd be a spoiler.TRAINSPOTTING may be a comedy (and a dark one, at that) but it doesn't shy away from its subject matter. Heroin is a plague in the world and it's claiming new victims all the time. The laughs from the crew's heroin-fueled antics are often interrupted with reality checks to serve as a reminder of the consequences. A junkie mother pays the ultimate price for her obsession. Spud serves time after a little harmless shoplifting with his buddies to feed their habit. Renton discovers the full extent of the withdrawal experience. And Tommy, well, just watch the movie if you've never seen it. TRAINSPOTTING is right up there with Darren Aronofsky's REQIUEM FOR A DREAM as a movie that serves to dissuade any fools out there from finding glamour in the life of drug addiction. Despite the laughs, it's an effective PSA about the dangers of heroin abuse.I've seen the movie a few times now and I'm still ready to back for more. I've come to understand why TRAINSPOTTING has got the reputation it does as a 'must-see' film. It's equal parts fun and cringe inducing. It's a solid character film that established Boyle as a major cinematic talent and led McGregor down the dark path to something far worse than heroin: George Lucas' STAR WARS prequels. Kidding, of course. Heroin sucks.",8,1,2,26 June 2014
Signs," More thrills from Shyamalan...
","One day I would love to work with M. Night Shyamalan for two reasons: 1) he generally films in Pennsylvania, my home state, and 2) I am quickly becoming a fan of his movies. I loved 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village' was decent, but 'Signs' is my favorite of his movies. The entire movie, start to finish, has a tense, creepy atmosphere (partially due to James Newton Howard's score).'Signs' is about the Hess family living on a farm in rural Pennsylvania. Graham Hess (Mel Gibson) is a former Reverend who lost his faith in religion after the loss of his wife. Joaquin Phoenix plays his brother, Merrill. Mysterious crop circles appear overnight in the Hess' corn field, and soon begin sprouting up in locations all over the world. Tensions soon rise both in the Hess home and worldwide as the meaning of these symbols is gradually made clear. This movie touches on the topics of faith and the belief that everything happens for a reason.I wouldn't say this movie is very deep, despite its thought-provoking conversations, but it is definitely fun to watch. I love how Shyamalan's movie once again proves that showing less can be scarier than showing everything. The suspense builds as you are right there with the Hess family as they are terrorized by an unseen enemy.The acting in this movie has a coldness to it, every line delivered with seriousness. Even by the children. While I thought it awkward at first, I soon overlooked it as it added to the mood. For fans of Shyamalan, this movie is a must.",8,0,2,26 May 2005
Identity," Cool Twist on a Familiar Thriller Theme
","IDENTITY takes a concept that we've seen countless times before and puts an interesting new spin on it. It's got its problems, but sports a mostly solid cast and a cool enough twist to make it stand out as a fun thriller. It starts as your usual 'Ten Little Indians' style thriller, with a group of seemingly random people brought together in an isolated location before they begin dying off one by one under mysterious circumstances, but IDENTITY has a unique twist (that I will try to avoid ruining here in case you haven't seen the movie). The events are set in a desolate Nevada motel in the middle of the desert where a rainstorm has stranded 10 strangers for the night: Ed (Cusack) is a limousine driver transporting a washed up actress with an attitude, Paris (Peet) is a prostitute on her way to Florida in an effort to start a new life, Rhodes (Liotta) is a police officer moving a serial murderer between prisons, Ginny (Duvall) and Lou (Scott) are miserable newlyweds, and the York family is searching for help when the mother is run down by Ed's limo in a horrific accident. The storm has flooded all roads out of the area and soon visitors are killed in bizarre ways and paranoia settles in when they realize the killer could be any one of them. Meanwhile, in a seemingly unrelated story, a man convicted of multiple homicides is given one last opportunity to plead his case with a judge in hopes of staving off a death sentence.It's tough to mention any parts of the film that either worked or failed without wandering into spoiler territory so I'll try to keep it vague story-wise. For the most part, it's a cool movie. I love movies set in a single isolated location (in this case the motel) because the location becomes it's own character. Here is a creepy, worn-out motel with it's buzzing neon sign in the middle of an empty highway, run by a scrawny, strung-out out man who has his own secrets. The rain is a constant presence, adding to the horror movie vibe. Without the ability to jump between locations, a movie like this is forced to turn to its characters for the story, so the movie really rides of the cast and their performances to carry its weight. Director James Mangold and cinematographer Phedon Papamicheal do an awesome job of giving the movie it's foreboding atmosphere and the cast make an otherwise 'been there, done that' story feel fresh. John Cusack is an awesome character actor and you can pretty much count on him to keep it interesting, and Ray Liotta has pretty much made a career out of playing cops/criminals so his turn here as the short-tempered Rhodes isn't a stretch for him. There are a few other good performances out of the supporting crew (mostly Amanda Peet and John Hawkes, as the shifty motel owner), but the rest border on annoying and over-the-top. Then again, John C. McGinley is almost always over-the-top, so I guess he can be forgiven here.The main draw of IDENTITY is, of course, the big reveal at the end of the second act that ties everything together and explains the logic behind it all. In theory, it was a cool twist and it adds a lot to the movie. It's something we hadn't seen done before and I can appreciate any movie that gets creative with old ideas. The problem was in the execution. I can forgive any other aggravation or annoyances with the movie, but the final reveal is just too laughable. So, in a way, the movie is really cool up until the final five minutes. The end just spoils it. Anyone who has seen it would probably agree. I can almost see why it was written that way, and it sort of makes sense. But that doesn't make it any less amusing and, since this isn't meant to be a comedy, sort of ruins the vibe. IDENTITY is a cool movie despite its flaws. I hate to say it's forgettable but it's just one of those movies that sank into the background soon after its release. I'd forgotten about it until I saw it sitting on my shelf collecting dust and gave it another viewing to see if it held up. And it does, pretty well. It won't wow anyone and it might make you chuckle at the end, but IDENTITY is pretty good overall.",8,2,3,30 October 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Great Action Movie, but Missing the DIE HARD Vibe
","The fourth film in the DIE HARD franchise had a lot working against it: it had been more than a decade since the last film and the filmmakers had fallen into the recent pitfall of shooting for a PG-13 rating to broaden the audience (and, by extension, the box office profits). DIE HARD is one of those series that just cannot be anything less than a solid R-rating. If you're planning on watching LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD for the first time, do yourself a favor and find a copy of the unrated cut where the bloody violence and language have been restored to the series norm. If you do, you'll find the movie a lot better than settling for the defanged theatrical version. The movie finds John McClane (Bruce Willis, returning to the role) roped into an investigation when someone hacks the FBI and the usual suspects are rounded up. McClane's job is to bring in Matthew Farrell (Justin Long) for questioning but, before he can bring Farrell in, the two become targets for whoever has marked the hacker for death. Within hours, the United States is under a full-scale assault on its computer networks with transportation, communications, and utilities on the list of targeted systems. With the nation plunging into chaos, McClane and Farrell are the country's main hope in stopping a cyber criminal with a solid plan of bringing the United States to its knees. It's DIE HARD for a new millennium with John McClane facing his most baffling challenge yet: modern technology.Movie studios revisiting old franchises to milk further profits out of its audience has a sketchy history of failing to provide a decent film; if you have any doubts, feel free to revisit other attempts from around the same timeKINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL (2008) and HANNIBAL RISING (2007). The idea becomes even more questionable when the original star is brought back to the role they made legendary (e.g. Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones). When the actors weren't that young to begin with, a ten year gap between films can mean a massive difference. Oddly enough, it's not so much the case with Bruce Willis. Maybe it's just because the man is the embodiment of disgruntled cop, but he falls right into the role and I never found myself questioning if he was too old for the same action. John McClane is probably Willis's best role ever and he hasn't lost that spark yet. If anything, Willis is the best part of this whole movie when the comic relief and extravagant action set pieces get to be too much. Justin Long is that comic relief, with his character of Farrell failing to speak in anything but sarcasm. It's funny for a bit, but wears by the end. The villain, played by Timothy Olyphant, is acceptable for a bit of modern day evil; rather than brute force, the most dangerous modern terrorist is the one who can steal everything the country has come to take for granted with a few keystrokes.I actually dig the fact that DIE HARD 4.0 made an attempt to modernize the series with McClane finding himself lost and confused in a world that continued on without him. It was a cool touch. Overall, I was pretty satisfied with the story in the new movie, but it was the way it was told that didn't sit right with me. I know McClane has gotten himself into some crazy situations before, but this movie goes a little too overboard for my tastes. McClane is a stone-cold action hero, but he's always been human. He can be hurt, he can be weakened. DIE HARD 4.0 has him jumping on top of an F-35 fighter jet from a collapsing freeway and launching a police car at a helicopter. He's gone from human to superhuman. I mean, come on, I can't be the only one who felt this was the most off-putting aspect of the movie. I have to admit that this is a solid, fun action movie but it doesn't feel like a real DIE HARD. I guess this was 20th Century Fox's attempt at rejuvenating the franchise and selling it a generation of audience members who might have been too long to catch any of the originals (which also explains the PG-13), but it's sort of a betrayal from anyone wanting to sit down for a new adventure for the John McClane we know. LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD has some great action and a few sharp one-liners, but it's ultimately missing something.",8,1,1,25 September 2012
X2: X-Men United," What an X-Men film SHOULD be!
","Wow. Just...wow. This movie turned out to be everything I had hoped the first X-Men film would be. Plenty of action, plenty of story, and terrific performances from the cast. I had a couple of complaints about the introduction to one of my favorite Marvel franchises, but all of those complaints are gone with the newest installment. The movie begins with strength (a great scene of Nightcrawler attacking the White House) and doesn't slow down until the end credits roll.Of course, one of the best things to look forward to when a new X-Men film is being released is 'What new characters are they bringing in this time?' and once again, Singer brings nothing but the best. The sequel introduces Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming does an awesome job with one of my favorite X-Men), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), and Lady Deathstrike (Kelly Hu). As for Brian Cox, I enjoy watching him in just about any role, and he brings a perfect restrained hatred to the character of William Stryker, the military scientist whose plans bring the X-Men and Brotherhood to work together. I was also happy to see that Bobby Drake (Iceman) was given a larger role; seeing as how in the comics, Iceman was one of the first X-Men, I thought they severely underused him in the first film.Since a majority of the characters were introduced already, Singer didn't have to slow things down this time around so the audience could get to know everyone. Where I thought the first film had a handful of moments that dragged, this one has none. Despite that this movie times at just over 2 hours, it feels like it flies by. Even better, the action in this movie is more brutal, showing more of what Wolverine is capable of (he IS the best at what he does, after all...). We even get a better glimpse at the mutants' powers in action with special effects that are even better than last time.The one and only problem with the film was pretty much unavoidable. In a movie with a cast this large, some characters are bound to be underused. I thought Deathstrike was a great addition to the roster, but she is only given ONE line and ONE fight scene (granted, it's a freakin' awesome fight). The character of Colossus was brought in (FINALLY!) but only made a brief appearance. But, I do understand the limits when trying to include so many people in a single movie and I don't let it get to me.This movie is yet another example that a sequel can surpass the original. I couldn't be happier with the latest in the franchise and this movie is going to rank high as my favorite movies for years to come.",9,1,2,24 September 2007
Thor: The Dark World," A Solid Improvement Over the Original THOR
","I may be alone in this opinion but I believed Kenneth Branagh's THOR was the weakest film in the first phase of Marvel films. Yes, even weaker than IRON MAN 2. It wasn't that I hated the film but it failed to leave any sort of impression on me. Thor was always going to be one of the more difficult characters for Marvel to bring to the big screen. As opposed to characters with more 'grounded' (in the loosest sense of the term) origins, Thor is a more mystical being. He's a demigod from another dimension who's near invulnerable to most forms of damage. So, right off the bat, he's not the easiest to relate to. So the first film went the route of a 'fish- out-of-water' scenario as Thor loses his Asgardian powers and is banished to Earth to learn his lesson. So he spends a nice portion of the movie without actually being a superhero and we spend it on Earth. You know, that place we've spent every other Marvel movie to that point despite Marvel having a rich mythology with countless other possibilities. So, yeah, THOR was enjoyable but forgettable. But THE DARK WORLD corrects for these past weaknesses and actually brought us a Thor movie that I really enjoyed. The movie begins following the events of THE AVENGERS, with Loki condemned to the Asgardian dungeon for his crimes and Thor struggling to clean up the mess his brother's defiance had created across the Nine Realms.So, for starters, that's a major bonus in this film. We get a nice glimpse of realms other than Asgard, Earth, and Jotunheim. We even get to visit Vanaheim and Svartalfheim. So finally, the Thor films spread their wings a bit and we spend very little time on Earth this time around. It gave the filmmakers opportunities to have some fun with the production design. We get a much grander view of Asgard. It doesn't necessarily look as polished this time around. The first film made Asgard out to be very polished and shiny while THE DARK WORLD gives it a more tactile appearance with stone constructs and shady taverns. Svartalfheim is nothing more than a desolate wasteland with dark sands and a bizarre greenish atmosphere. It is the home of the film's villains, the Dark Elves. With their ruler, Malekith (Christopher Eccleston, the Dark Elves have been around since the creation of our universe and once thrived in the darkness before it's creation. Since the arrival of our universe and the light it brought, the Elves have been fighting for a means of eliminating it to return the universe to ever-lasting darkness. They'd been defeated once before by the Asgardians, under the command of Thor's grandfather Bor. They are awaken from their slumber once again when Jane Foster (Natalie Portman, returning) stumbles across the MCU's latest mystical artifact, the Aether. We never really get a good idea of what the Aether does. We're just told that it's incredibly powerful and Malekith can somehow use it to bring darkness across the Nine Realms during a cosmic event known as the Convergence when all of the realms align.There's our first misstep. The Aether is poorly explained. We see that it has some pretty nifty powers but their never really defined. It's just a shapeless mass of red liquid that provides its owner with seemingly unlimited power. We know these films are bound to have MacGuffins but do we need to treat them so shoddily? Give us some history, some detail. Malekith is obsessed with it and, again, that's about as much detail we get on another important aspect of the story. There have been a lot of complaints about Malekith being underdeveloped and I can't say I entirely disagree. We have a basic motivation and that's about it. He wants to return the universe to darkness and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish it, but give us some more. There has to be more to him. He seems like such a cool character. He could've easily been one of the better MCU villains with some extra time spent getting to know him, but he's relegated to a single mindless goal. The Dark Elves seem to be a very proud people and their talented warriors. There's some history there, so give us a bit. I love their visual style. The black and white color scheme and emotionless face masks give them a wicked creepy appearance. And Kurse is probably the best creature design in any of the films. Director Alan Taylor and his team nailed it with the film's visuals.The cast is mostly fantastic as well. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston inhabit their roles at this point better than I can imagine anyone else would. There's a great brotherly chemistry between them and each of them have grown over the MCU series. Thor has become the noble warrior he was destined to be, surpassing even his father in his tact and strength. Loki continues to reign as one of Marvel's best movie villains and he's given a chance to show a more compassionate side when tragic events give him a reason to fight alongside his brother. Natalie Portman continues to prove that she's just not quite meant for comic movies. I know she's got talent but she always comes across as wooden as Jane in these movies. Kat Dennings returns as unnecessary comic relief and, while I was fine with her excessive goofiness in the first movie, it wasn't really needed here. THE DARK WORLD is a more serious film than it's predecessor and I would've been fine with the little bit of humor that comes through the Thor/Loki interactions. Christopher Eccleston and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje are wasted potential as the baddies but they do the best with the limited material they're given.In the end, THE DARK WORLD is a great sequel to a decent film and helped solidify Marvel's second phase of films as an improvement.",8,1,1,14 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Glorious Return of the STAR WARS Saga
","STAR WARS has made its glorious return. Real STAR WARS, not that garbage about trade negotiations or Gungans or whatever. Real STAR WARS with Luke Skywalker (sort of), Han Solo, no-longer a princess Leia, and the Millennium Falcon. After reinvigorating the STAR TREK film franchise for new audiences, director J.J. Abrams stepped into what could have been a disastrous end to his career with the seventh installment of the STAR WARS saga. THE FORCE AWAKENS was no doubt the most anticipated film ever as it brought us back into the beloved universe and continues the tale thirty or so years after the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. I saw it twice in theaters and I've watched it a few times more since it was released on home video, and I'm happy to say that my opinion on the movie hasn't changed much. THE FORCE AWAKENS is a good movie. I find it thoroughly entertaining as long as I don't think on it too much. It has some issues, as is expected of any movie, but it's so much fun to watch that I'm able mostly see past them. The beginning of a new chapter, and the passing of the torch to a new generation of heroes, THE FORCE AWAKENS is about the search for Luke Skywalker (who's gone into hidden seclusion since a pupil of his turned to the dark side) and the race to save the citizens of the galaxy from the First Order from their new super-weapon.As an audience member, I thought this movie was great fun (as a SW geek, I had some minor quibbles). It had the fun and the energy of the original trilogy, so no long wooden speeches about the Force or politics, and it includes a return to one of the best parts that made those first movies so amazing to see: the practical effects. THE FORCE AWAKENS utilizes a perfect blend of practical sets and creature effects with visual effects for enhancement (rather than using them forwelleverything). Abrams and crew even included a nod to A NEW HOPE with a cantina scene full to the brim with bizarre alien creatures to showcase that, yes, this movie had the fans in mind. Han Solo and Chewbacca are major characters in the film with Leia accepting more of a supporting role this time, but the movie makes it clear that we'll surely get more of Leia and Luke in the movies that follow. It was indescribably exciting to see Han and Chewie on the Millennium Falcon again; it was something I never thought I'd see. We can't focus on the heroes of the former generation though as the movie introduces us to the heroes of the next generation. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac have been positioned as the franchise's new heroic trio and I thought each of them did a phenomenal job rising to the challenge. The cast wouldn't be complete without a droid sidekick though and we're introduced to BB-8. I was a little hesitant to accept BB-8 at first since it appeared a little childish and I worried it was crammed in to appeal to younger audience members, but it won me over. I can't complain. RETURN OF THE JEDI had Ewoks and I never questioned them.THE FORCE AWAKENS also comes with its own brand new roster of villains. There have been some jokes at the expense of Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), the film's answer to Darth Vader. Ren is relatively new to the world of the Force and is still mastering his abilities, aspiring to be a worthy successor to Vader in helping lead the First Order to victory against the Republic. I thought Driver was fantastic in the role, and Ren was probably the most interesting character in the movie. He's certainly the most well- rounded. His ambitions are clear. He has flaws (his temper tantrums were my favorite part of the movie). He's skilled in the Force but he's still learning to use it to his fullest extent. I'm excited to see where episodes XIII and IX will take him. Domhnall Gleeson, Gwendoline Christie, and Andy Serkis provide backup as other key members in the First Order but they're all left pretty vague or one-dimensional. For the purposes of this film, anyway. It is a bit of a bummer that the movie utilizes another Death Star plot device (only bigger, because why not) but, again, I'm hoping the next two films in the new trilogy might try and break some new ground in plot. There have been a lot of comparisons between FORCE AWAKENS and NEW HOPE and, as far as I'm concerned, they're well-founded. This movie takes a lot of its cues from that first film. It's a little disappointing but I can understand why the studios played it a little safer this time after the scorn brought on by those prequel films.THE FORCE AWAKENS is not perfect. It has lulls. It's a little predictable. Also, I'm one of those in that camp that believes that Rey (Ridley) was a little too skilled at everything for someone who's been trapped on a desert planet scavenging for junk since she was a kid. I love her as a character, but I'd appreciate a bit more of a struggle. She went from wobbly dragging the Falcon's cockpit through the desert dunes to masterfully navigating it through the interior of a Star Destroyer in no time, and I've no reason to believe she's ever flown a spacecraft for any extended period. It's one of a handful of complaints but I won't go into them here because none of them really affected my enjoyment of the film. STAR WARS is back and its first new film hits all the right notes. Saga fans rejoice!",8,1,17,24 December 2016
RED," Flashy, Fun & Shallow; RED Proves Age Doesn't Hurt Action
","Just as Stallone did with THE EXPENDABLES, Bruce Willis proves he's not too old for action in RED. It seems 2010 was the year for off-the-wall action films, and while RED wasn't the best (that would be THE A-TEAM in my opinion), it definitely wasn't the worst. It's based on comic mini-series from Homage Comics, though pretty loosely from what I understand. I've never read the series so I couldn't tell you, but I enjoyed the film adaptation from director Robert Schwentke. The film centers on retired CIA agent Frank Moses (Willis) as he discovers the agency has marked him for termination. He snatches up Sarah Ross (Parker), his pension fund handler on whom he's got a crush, and hightails it out to find his old team members. With the CIA on his trail and a conspiracy unraveling from his past, Moses recruits some of his fellow retirees: Joe (Freeman) has cancer and is spending his final days in a retirement home, Marvin (Malkovich) lives in the swamps of Florida hiding from government satellites, and Victoria (Mirren) runs a bed and breakfast while taking the occasional contract on the side.The movie's not bad, but it's nothing to get excited about. It's got some great action sequences, but the film falls into the same trap as many other modern action films. The characters never seem as if they're in any real danger, treating even the tightest of situations as a total joke and smirking their way through trouble. The film tries to jerk us back to reality for a moment halfway through the film with an unexpected death but it doesn't take long to jump back into the next action sequence. It's a flashy, fun, and completely shallow. The film comes off as more of a comedy than an action film, with plenty of jokes about the aging characters going toe-to-toe with their younger adversaries. My favorite scene in the whole film has Bruce Willis in a brutal fight with Karl Urban (as the CIA agent in charge of bringing Moses in) to the sounds of Aerosmith's 'Back in the Saddle'. It's the only fight that seems to have any weight behind as it appears the two are beating the crap out of each other. The rest of the fights are loud and devoid of suspense, but fun enough.It's a shame the film isn't better because it looks like everyone involved is having a blast with it all. Willis hams it in and passes through every scene with a wry smile on his face, and Mirren seemed to enjoy the chance to join in on the mayhem (I'm sure she doesn't get too many offers for blowout roles like these at this point). Malkovich does crazy better than just about anyone, so he's perfect for the role of an ex-CIA agent who's mind has been warped from repeated secret LSD testing. The coolest part of the film is Brian Cox as a KGB agent who's passed his prime and longs for the good ol' days of the Cold War, and Karl Urban reminds us he has the potential to be one of the coolest modern action stars (I always thought he was pretty good in DOOM). All of this, and Richard Dreyfus in a supporting role, and the film still never rises past the point of eye candy. I loved watching it, but nothing about it stuck with me afterwards. There's always the chance for a sequel, and if RED is given another chance I hope the filmmakers will try to rise above forgettable action romp.",7,0,0,16 March 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," CATCHING FIRE is an Impressive Improvement over the First HUNGER GAMES
","The association of young adult novels with film adaptations is almost as sour as that of video games. It doesn't inspire a lot of confidence and there has been a lot of garbage shoveled onto cinema screens hoping to catch the same insane (and unjustifiable) success as those horrible TWILIGHT films. But there is usually an exception to every rule and that exception is THE HUNGER GAMES. I only finally caved and watched the first film when I saw the unusually positive reviews surrounding it. The premise had seemed interesting enough but I figured it'd be nothing more than a painfully lame teenaged love drama. I was wrong and I actually enjoyed it. I wasn't sure it deserved the hype it got, but I still thought it was a surprisingly good movie. As successful as it was, it was an obvious choice for the studios to continue on with the rest of Suzanne Collins book series (which, for the record, I haven't read) and 2013 brought us the second installment: CATCHING FIRE. It begins almost immediately after the events of the first film. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) have just won the 74th Hunger Games in a historic event where, for the first time, two victors have been declared. This upset has caused ripples throughout Panem (the dystopian nation setting of the film) and it's shown cracks in the seemingly limitless control of the Capitol. President Snow (Donald Sutherland) warns Katniss to maintain the lie that she and Peeta are madly in love (there's a bit of back story here that I'm can't be bothered to covergo watch the first movie for the whole story on it) so the double win can be attributed to the Capitol's kindness to a pair of lovers as opposed to a ruse that allowed them to alter the rules and survive. The lives of Katniss and everyone she loves is at stake should she fail. Meanwhile, there are rumblings of rebellion throughout the twelve districts, inspired by Katniss and Peeta's success. Katniss has become a symbol of rebellion against the Capitol and, in an effort to squash any shred of hope behind it, Snow declares that the 75th Hungar Games, the Quarter Quell, will consist of surviving tributes from games past.You know how I know CATCHING FIRE (well, the whole saga, really) is any good? Because it takes so much just to explain the basic plot to someone who's unfamiliar, and there's still so much I left out due to spoilers and length constraints. And the fact that, once you watch the movie, it all makes perfect sense. It's not overly complicated for the sake of making it seem complex. It's actually an incredibly good story for a young adult film. The first HUNGER GAMES was good, but nothing mind- blowing. It was a cool premise that delivered on it's novel premise of teens being forced to kill each other for the amusement of the incredibly wealthy while establishing an interesting world with a rich history and bizarre culture that, when you see where our own culture seems to be heading, sort of seems believable despite it's over-the-top nature. CATCHING FIRE takes everything established in the first film and starts building a more engaging story over it. The first movie was all about introducing us to Panem and the Hunger Games. The second movie lights the powder keg that will lead to rebellion with an almost unwilling Katniss at the forefront. Katniss has become a very layered character since we've last seen her. She's survived a traumatic experience and she's still haunted by the fact that she was forced to murder other tributes. She's got a bit of post-traumatic stress, and her problems are just beginning. The end of the Games was just the beginning. Now she's got to go on the victor's tour and keep the illusion that her and Peeta are in love or Snow will essentially murder everyone she loves. That's a lot to process. She's willing to go along because, at the start of the film, she's only interested in saving herself and her loved ones. But she will need to start thinking more globally by the end. The districts have started viewing her as a figure of rebellion and they've started showing their support, and Snow has noticed. CATCHING FIRE isn't so much about the Games (though Katniss is once again dropped into the life-or-death competition) as it is about Katniss evolving into the 'Mockingjay'the symbol of the new rebellion against the Capitol.I hate to make this comparison because the HUNGER GAMES movies aren't on the same footing as the epic STAR WARS films (wellI suppose it is light years better than the prequels) but CATCHING FIRE is the EMPIRE STRIKES BACK to the first film's STAR WARS. It's a more serious, brooding film with more at stake and the foundation laid for some grand finale to come in the final two films. It even ends on a sort of cliff- hanger. The production value is amped up and the tone is more mature, despite the bizarre fashion stylings of the Captiol crowd. Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) still looks like a psychedelic Barbie doll but even she has moments of humanity shine through when she sees how the Capitol has essentially condemned Katniss and Peeta to death. CATCHING FIRE feels like an almost completely different film from the first. It's emotional and it's way more engaging. Honestly, while the Games are the main attraction in these films, I was more interested in everything that happened before Katniss was dropped into the arena this time around. I was so impressed and entertained by CATCHING FIRE that I will actually go to the theater for the next installment, MOCKINGJAY.",9,1,15,26 July 2014
Godzilla," Top Notch Monster Effects with a Wooden Protagonist
","When the new GODZILLA had hit theaters in 2014, there was an enormous amount of hatred spewed online about how horrible it was. People were complaining in droves about the wooden acting and the fact that the movie's namesake barely appeared in the film at all. Some of these complaints are perfectly legit, but othersin my opinionnot so much. Before GODZILLA was released, I did a bit of homework. Having never actually seen a Godzilla film before but interested in this new film, I watched the original 1954 film (as well as the 1956 American version) and four different Toho films from the later collection. Maybe it's because I put way more thought into it than I should've, but I didn't hate GODZILLA and each subsequent viewing made it more and more entertaining. The movie opens in the late 90's, when a mining crew stumbled across a couple giant eggs of unknown origin in an underground chamber. Years later, a creature emerges from the within and busts out of the research facility that had contained it. It carves a path of destruction through Japan and then across the Pacific to the western coast of the United States where it intends to mate with another MUTO (massive unidentified terrestrial organism) that has hatched from a similar egg that had been dumped into storage in Nevada. Mankind has only one hope to stop these creatures: Godzilla. The king of monsters awakens and beelines for California where it will do battle with the MUTOsbut can man trust he won't turn his destructive power on them next?I'm going to start by defending this movie. For all the people who complain that Godzilla doesn't get much screen time or that his first couple battles against the MUTOs occur off screen, you went into this movie with the wrong expectations. Considering director Gareth Edwards was most likely brought on based on the strengths of his movie MONSTERS which, as I understand (I haven't seen it), tells the story of a giant monster attack form the perspective of the humans on the ground and doesn't actually feature much of the beast. Then, if you go back and watch the original GOJIRA, Godzilla doesn't feature much until the final march into Tokyo. Until the end, Godzilla is seen in bits and piecesa glimpse of his head towering over a hill, his foot coming down into a home, etc. So I personally understand Edwards' decision to give Godzilla minimal screen time (and even that's unfairwe see plenty of him) and saving the on-screen battle for the very end. He's building tension. If he'd given us what we want right away, what interest would we have had in staying through to the end? The creature design on Godzilla is fantastic. He's got the classic design brought to life with seamless CG with a few updates to make him a little more menacing. I'm not as keen on the look of the MUTOs. That would be a complaint of mine. With all the other monsters already populating Toho's collection, why go with an original creation? And why go with a design that feels too familiar to what we've seen in CLOVERFIELD or PACIFIC RIM? While I'm on the topic of the MUTOs, why would they have developed an EMP defense? From an evolutionary standpoint, the ability to produce an electromagnetic pulse would've only been useful in the last hundred years. These creatures have been around for millennia. It's useful from a storytelling perspective (keeps the humans helpless around them) but makes no sense otherwise.So, while I can forgive Edwards for not spoiling us with an abundance of creature battles, I can't forgive him for his casting and direction. GODZILLA puts us in the perspective of Ford Brody, an explosives expert with the American military played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I know Taylor-Johnson has got skill. He was great in KICK- ASS and NOWHERE BOY. But here, he's the most wooden, uninteresting character I have seen in a film in a long, long time. He never quite emotes, speaking all his lines very quietly without much of any sort of inflection. I think the only emotion he displayed the entire time was mild irritation. He was dull and, since he's our 'main character', every sequence that wasn't Godzilla or MUTOs tearing through society suffered. Elizabeth Olsen, another talented young star, is similarly wasted on the other end of the spectrum. She spends most of the time crying or panicking. If we were going to spend an entire movie following a character through this fantastical crisis, it should've been Dr. Ishiro Serizawa (Ken Watanabe) or Ford's father Joe (Bryan Cranston). Oh, and don't expect much Joe. Despite being prominently displayed in pretty much every trailer or TV spot, Cranston actually has less screen time than Godzilla. Not cool, Warner/Legendary. Not cool. GODZILLA is a nice blend of elements from both the original, more subtle GOJIRA and the city-smashing monster battles of Toho's later films. It's flawed and its human characters are its weakest bit. But you can't argue with the presentation of Japan's most famous monsterthe design and CG are amazing and his final battle with the MUTOs, while short, is awesome. I might be in the minority but I didn't hate this movie and I find I enjoy it a little more each time I watch it. Manage your expectations and you should find something to enjoy about the 2014 resurrection of the legend: GODZILLA.",7,2,3,20 February 2015
Looper," An Incredibly Solid Action Film & Creative Bit of Sci-Fi
","I am an instant fan of new, creative science fiction when it comes along. We don't get it often but we've gotten a nice resurgence in recent years with Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and Neill Blomkamp (DISTRICT 9). I haven't been lucky enough to catch any of writer/director Rian Johnson's previous movies but there was a lot of positive hype surrounding LOOPER. The trailers hadn't grabbed me and the premise, while interesting, seemed like it could go in a generic direction. But the widespread positive word-of-mouth dragged me in and I'm so glad it did. LOOPER is the latest in well-directed, thought-provoking science fiction. It's set in the year 2044 where most of civilized society is in shambles. Poverty and violence are commonplace, so it's no surprise that many people turn to crime. There is one segment of the criminal world worth notice: the loopers. Loopers are hired guns overseen by a minor mob boss from the future, a future where time travel was invented and instantly outlawed. Some of the larger criminal organizations use it to send their victims to a time where their body can be disposed of without issue. The loopers kill the target, dispose of the body, and collect the rewarduntil their loop is closed. Thirty years in the future, the retired loopers are sent back in time for elimination to remove any trace of their involvement. When Joe, a young looper, is put in the position to close his loop and fails, he becomes a target unless he can track down his older self and kill him.I admit it sounds really confusing to have to try and explain it to someone. This really is one of those movies you just need to watch. Keep in mind, this is a movie about time travel and you can expect paradoxes or plot holes or whatever. It's going to happen, as it does with all of them (yes, even the classic BACK TO THE FUTURE). Just accept it. The time travel element is handled incredibly well and nitpicking is going to do nothing but ruin the experience for you. Even the elder Joe (Bruce Willis) is given a scene in which he basically says it outright: don't worry about the mechanics of it all. That's not where the story lies. The story is about young Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), the elder Joe (Willis), and the strong woman they encounter on a rural Kansas farm with a little son who is more important to the future than she could ever imagine. That's what I liked most about the story. I walked in expecting a cat-and- mouse chase movie where Joseph Gordon-Levitt spends the entire time chasing down his future self and saving himself from the mob heavies on his trail. Instead, the movie quickly shifts gears when Bruce Willis arrives in the past and discover that his intention isn't just to avoid his own assassination but to change the course events in the future. It becomes so much more than a chase movie and I give it a lot of respect for that alone.I also love that the majority of the effects in this movie were done practically. You wouldn't necessarily know it from looking at it. There was a lot added digitally into the background to improve on the cityscapes and all that, but a lot of the gunfights, TK (telekinetic) effects, and even the hovering motorbikes were all done practically. I love any movie that prefers practical over digital because it feels that much more real. Then there are the makeup effects. Gordon-Levitt was made up to look more like a thirty-year younger version of Bruce Willis and it really works. It's a little off-putting at first to see him with bright blue eyes, but it's crazy how much he was able to emulate Willis's nature and mannerisms. It's an easy sell to accept him as the same person minus thirty additional years of experience and suffering. Emily Blunt is in the movie as Sara, the strong independent mother of a special child. She does a commendable job in the movie, considering the only thing I've seen her in previously was THE FIVE-YEAR ENGAGEMENT and didn't give her much to work with. As an added bonus, we get Jeff Daniels as mob boss Abe. All of this comes together to create one of the most unique, exciting movies of the year. LOOPER is one that I hope everyone will check out at some point. It's great science fiction without the burden of exhausting tech details or geek culture. It's just an incredibly solid action film.",8,2,6,5 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A classic sci-fi adventure...
","It's tough to write a comment for this movie. What is there to say that hasn't been said before in countless other comments? From back in the days when great movies flowed from George Lucas like water, 'Star Wars' has become a classic. Nearly everyone has seen this film and few people have I ever heard talk bad about it. Personally, I have absolutely nothing negative to say.'Star Wars' is the story of young Luke Skywalker and his chance meeting with the Jedi (a man who once acted as a guardian of the galaxy, using a mystical power known as the Force) Obi-Wan Kenobi. This meeting leads to his eventual joining Kenobi on a quest to rescue a princess held prisoner aboard the Galactic Empire's powerful space station, the Death Star. The story is exciting, with characters that are forever memorable.This movie goes to show that Lucas originally had a knack for great casting. When casting for this movie, Lucas says he looked for actors/actresses with great personalities (I won't ask why that changed for the prequel trilogy). Casting the relative unknowns Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher was one of the greatest moves ever made by Lucas. I could never picture anyone but Harrison Ford as Han Solo, the cocky smuggler and pilot of the Millennium Falcon.While Lucas acts as if the low budget special effects are a weakness, I consider it a bonus. The planets in this movie have a gritty, lived in look. The space travel and starships look realistic enough to keep me engrossed.Usually I recommend watching a movie I praise at the end of my comments, but this is 'Star Wars'. Who hasn't already seen it?",8,1,2,16 May 2005
50_50," A Powerful Drama with a Light Comedic Edge
","When you're trying to advertise a heartfelt drama/comedy about one guy's struggle with his cancer diagnosis, perhaps it's not best to lead with the line 'from the guys who brought you SUPERBAD'. Not because I was fooled. No, I read reviews and follow news on movies that pique my interest. But the general movie-going public who relies solely on advertising when making decisions on what movies to check out, they might've felt a little gypped. I thought this movie was misrepresented in the trailers and TV spots, and I wonder if it led to the mediocre box office results. I didn't really see a lot of ads for it and the ones that I did see try to spin it as a 'laugh-out-loud' comedy. Not quite. The movie is based on screenwriter Will Reiser's personal experiences when he was diagnoses and subsequently beat cancer in his mid-20s. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Adam Lerner, an employee for Seattle Public Radio and the ultimate personification of risk avoidance. He has no bad habits and won't even cross the street unless he's given the OK from a pedestrian signjust in case. Which is why it comes as such a surprise to him when he's diagnosed with a cancerous tumor on his spine. The odds aren't good, with most people finding a 50% chance of survival in the best cases. Now he begins the process of coping with his illness and his 50/50 odds with the help of his best friend Kyle (Seth Rogen), his artist girlfriend (Bryce Dallas Howard), his over-bearing mother (Anjelica Huston), and his new therapist (Anna Kendrick).Yes, 50/50 is just as much a comedy as it is a drama, but it's not fair to label it as being in the same vein as the previous Rogen/Goldberg movies (SUPERBAD, PINEAPPLE EXPRESS). The association is a loose one and the comedy isn't on the same level. 50/50 doesn't really rely on vulgar language, shock humor, or absurd situations for its laughs. It's a much more natural humor that arises from the strained situations between it's characters. The drama is actually much more prominent here and there are some real heavy scenes in the movie that'll put a lump in the throat of the hardest person. The entire third act of the movie, the vibe shifts to a more serious tone and features some of the most heart-wrenching bits in the entire film. People might not have been expecting such a serious approach to the film because of how it was marketed. You're not going to find yourself laughing yourself to tears at zany situations but you might just find yourself tearing up when Adam is preparing for a potentially dangerous surgery. Not so say that the movie isn't funny, because it has some great moments. The humor is really blatant, but it's enough to earn some chuckles from the viewer. It's a tamer humor that falls more in line with movies like OUR IDIOT BROTHER as opposed to the usual Apatow-style comedy.Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who has somehow managed to skyrocket into the spotlight with awesome roles in a long line of recent major films (I officially forgive him for his Cobra Commander), does an amazing job in this movie. I'm almost surprised that he didn't receive more critical attention for 50/50. He rides a perfect balance of strength and despair in the face of his own mortality. Seth Rogen is the primary reason this movie must've earned it's R-rating. He provides his trademark brand of explicit humor and ranting. Funny, yes, but it didn't really feel like it fit in with the rest of the movie. It's hard to see two characters as different as Adam and Kyle as actual friends, but Rogen has enough as a 'good buddy' vibe that we buy him in his role. We believe him as a lovable loser who means well because that's what he's usually casted as. Anna Kendrick is adorable as a rookie therapist who's assigned to help Adam deal with his emotional struggle and still hasn't quite found her groove. Being that Adam is only her third patient, she's still trying things out and it's funny to watch her settle into her position. Not to mention, she has an excellent chemistry with Gordon-Levitt and you find yourself hoping the two get their happy ending. But this movie isn't about their relationship, it's about Adam's battle with cancer and how he, and everyone close to his life, comes to terms with it. It's a light-hearted comedy about a tender subject, but handles it in such a way that you feel the weight of the matter.",8,1,2,6 March 2012
What We Do in the Shadows," Hilarious Mockumentary on the New Zealand Undead Scene
","Who doesn't live a good mockumentary? Plenty of people, I suppose, but I'm not here on their behalf and I enjoy them. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS comes from Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement and is presented as a sort of undead version of MTV's 'The Real World'. A team of documentarians, wearing crucifixes and given the solemn promise that none of them would be eaten, enters the New Zealand flat of four vampires to give perspective on their day-to-day lives, culminating in an annual gathering of the local undead chapters (including witches and zombies) to celebrate the Unholy Masquerade. As the film opens, we are introduced to its subjects: Viago (Waititi), Vladislav (Clement), Deacon (Jonny Brugh), and Petyr (Ben Fransham) a group of friendly vampires whose lives span multiple centuries. We join them as they handle chore distribution, engage in the local Wellington nightlife, feed on the unsuspecting populace, and harass the local werewolves. They appear to have a pretty good handle on things until one of their intended meals escapes and returns months later to reveal that, thanks to an overzealous Petyr, he's been turned into a vampire. Nick (Cori Gonzalez-Macuer) forms an uneasy friendship with the flatmates, primarily because his human friend Stu (Stu Rutherford) is a pretty cool guy, but he's having a hard time grasping the subtleties of being undead and his boisterous nature brings a world of trouble for this group of bloodsuckers who are just trying to live peaceful lives as ancient vampires in a modern world.Personally, I found this movie to be loads of fun and have enormous replay value. I've seen it a few times now and I laugh just as hard each time. I'll admit, I get some extra enjoyment from the film because a few of my friends are in to vampire LARPing (live-action roleplay) and I can't help but think of them every time. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS has fun with all of the classic vampire clichés we've come to expect since the time of Dracula. We've grown so accustomed to vampires (in movies, anyhow) being cool, sexy, and flawless but this movie gives us a much more flawed, realistic approach. Why should vampirism automatically make someone supernaturally cool? Viago is a nineteenth-century dandy with an effeminate nature and a frustration over how his flatmates can't be bothered to lay towels down when draining their victims on his furniture. With the exception of Petyr (a traditional Nosferatu living in the basement), Vlad is the eldest vampire and obviously based more on the Dracula lore. He once prided himself on his shape-shifting abilities but he's been out of practice since a humiliating defeat at the hands of his arch-nemesis long ago. And then Deacon, while not as old as Vlad or (I believe) as young as Viago, seems to the have the more modern sensibilities. He's an unabashed slob, failing to complete his chores and often shoveling them off onto his poor familiar Jackie (Jackie van Beek) while dragging her along with promises of immortality.From everything I've seen and read from behind the scenes, most of WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS was improvised by the cast with a skeletal script just to give the story some structure. As much as I enjoy the films of Judd Apatow and his circle, compare them to what was accomplished here. This film is riotously funny from the opening moments with Viago's alarm going off at 6PM with hardly a moment over the entire 90 minutes that let's up the pace. And it was mostly accomplished on-set, in front of the cameras, with the cast riffing off one another. I love that. I love that the effects are cheap but charmingly so. When these guys fly, it's clumsy. Not necessarily because the characters can't control their flight but because the actors are lifted on wires and it's hard to control and they roll with it. Viago and Deacon get into a heated argument in the flat meeting at the beginning of the movie and launch into the air to get in each other's faces; just watch how sloppy Viago's landing is when he returns to his seat. It's little bits like that that give me added enjoyment. WHAT WE DO IN THE SHADOWS is one of the funniest movies of 2015 and I wish it had gotten more attention so we could ensure these guys return for more of their off-kilter brand of humor. Big recommend from me.",9,1,3,14 March 2016
Deadpool," DEADPOOL is Almost Everything I'd Hoped it Would Be
","It might sound cliché now because the market is being flooded with the character but Deadpool has been my favorite comic character for a while. I've wanted the Merc with the Mouth to get his own big screen movie for years, thinking Ryan Reynolds would be perfect for the role since his performance in BLADE TRINITY as wisecracking Hannibal King. I was excited for Reynolds to assume the role of Wade Wilson in X- MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE and devastated when the character was mutilated by the studio. I'd come to accept the fact that we'd probably never see a true Deadpool cinema incarnation and, lo and behold, Reynolds and crew come through in 2016. DEADPOOL wasn't just a fun, relatively faithful adaptation of my favorite Marvel character but a much needed break from comic book movie routine with the film's proud embracing of the R-rating and utilization of the Deadpool comic tropes we'd come to expect but assumed studios would nix for being 'too weird' for general audiences. In an effort to reeducate the unknowing masses, DEADPOOL serves as an origin film, explaining to those unfamiliar how Deadpool came to be horribly scarred, certifiably crazy, and essentially immortal. Wade Wilson (Reynolds) is a mercenary for hire who, shortly after finding his soul mate in equally damaged working girl Vanessa (Morena Baccarin), is diagnosed with terminal cancer. With limited options, he turns to the mysterious Ajax (Ed Skrein) who claims he can heal Wilson of his disease. And an antihero is born.DEADPOOL gets a lot of things right and a few things, well, not so much wrong as poorly handled. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoy this movie and I'm psyched at the level of success this little 'comic book movie that couldn't' has achieved. It was a stroke of luck that the movie ever saw production and the love of audiences to the tune of almost $800 billion in worldwide gross box office all but guarantees we won't have to fight so long to see the continuing adventures. Reynolds is exactly as perfect for the role as we'd all known he would be. He gets the character and truly brings him to life with all the wisecracks, juvenile humor, and bloody violence we'd hoped to see. The costume is fantastic, staying incredibly faithful to the comics and even giving his mask expressive eyes to bring it to life. I also loved the inclusion of T.J. Miller to the cast as Deadpool's buddy Weasel. I've been a fan of Miller for a little while and figured his absurd brand of improvised comedy would be an apt fit in the world of DEADPOOL. The two of them ensure that DEADPOOL is just as much a comedy as it is an action movie, which is exactly as it should be. Deadpool doesn't bring the senses of dread or stoic heroism that comes with the usual X-Men film. In DEADPOOL, our hero puts bullets in brainpans and turns violence into insane performance art.Deadpool is, of course, a character from the X-Men universe and as a result we get a couple of cameos to establish this. As to which X-Men cinematic universe we're rooted in, it confuses even Deadpool himself ('McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines can get so confusing.'), but he's given the chance to fight alongside fan-favorite and criminally-underused Colossus and his current mutant trainee Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand). These two act as the straight-edged, voices of reason to Deadpool's fourth-wall-breaking craziness in his search for revenge against Ajax. I loved both of them, especially Negasonic. We don't get much out of her character but her angsty teenage persona sets Deadpool up for some fun punchlines and her explosive powers come in handy during the final battle. Colossus is here to give valuable life lessons to Deadpool in hopes of swaying him to the forces of good. I enjoyed the odd-couple pairing of Colossus and Deadpool but I imagine we'll get better banter in the sequel where the end credits coda promises we'll be introduced togo watch for yourself. No spoilers here but it should be obvious to fans. Meanwhile, Colossus serves the role well even if he is comically preachy in his heroic speeches. I love that we finally get an accurate on-screen portrayal (huge, muscular, and Russian) but the CG wasn't always the greatest. It's easily forgiven, and still pretty impressive, considering the limited budget. It makes one hopeful we'll get to see Deadpool's unique brand of crazy interact with other X-Men in future installments.DEADPOOL isn't without its flaws. The plot is disappointingly simplistic. It's your average origin tale intermixed with a revenge plot, but at least it uses nonlinear storytelling to break it up a bit. Most of the origin element is given through flashbacks over the course of a freeway chase/battle that fills the first hour or so of the movie. Plus everyone beside Deadpool is relegated to two-dimensional characters who only exist to serve a plot purpose. Ajax, Vanessa, Weasel, and especially Ajax's second-in- command Angel Dust (Gina Carano) are pretty thin characters. DEADPOOL is pretty much a one-man show with the Merc with the Mouth taking center-stage and everyone else taking a backseat to his showboating. It's fine though. It's fun. And pretty violent so, you know, leave the kids home for this one. As Deadpool would tell you, he's the best there is at whatever Wolverine does. Wolverine never quite got to cut loose in the X-Men films to the extent Deadpool does here and, superhero or not, this is not a family film. The R-rating should've been a dead giveaway but I'm amazed at how I saw kids at my first screening. In short, DEADPOOL is a comic book movie for people who are tired of comic book movies, while still stumbling into same pitfalls of franchise-opening comic book movies.",8,2,6,15 January 2017
Get Him to the Greek," Aldous Snow Gets His Own Movie!
","I had commented on FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, stating that Russell Brand's self-focused rock star Aldous Snow was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. Apparently, I wasn't alone and writer-director Nicholas Stoller has returned to give the lead singer of fictional rock band Infant Sorrow his own movie. As the film begins, Aldous has fallen back into a life of stoned/drunken debauchery as his music career hits rock bottom with his universally hated album 'African Child' and his love life sits in shambles with his long-time lover model/pop star Jackie Q splits with their son. In Los Angeles, Aaron Green is an up-and-comer with Pinnacle Records and suggests to his boss that they hold a ten year anniversary concert with Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater. Aaron is given the job of flying out to London, wrangling Aldous, and ensuring that he gets him to Los Angeles in three days for his performance.I was worried when I saw the original trailers for this film. The jokes weren't coming off well and I began to fear a movie I'd been looking forward to was going to fall flat. I was so glad when I finally got to the theater and saw the film because it is HILARIOUS. Russell Brand as Snow is one of the funniest characters in recent years and he completely embodies his role (probably because some aspects are loosely pulled form his own personal life). Surprisingly, he even manages to give his character some depth and earn sympathy as the film progresses when it becomes apparent he's not a one-note joke but begins to show a bit of humanity. Jonah Hill, while usually a scene stealer in his own regard, is constantly over-shadowed by Brand's bravado. His character was written as a passive person, which sealed the deal of playing second fiddle when you put him with Brand's stoned energy.There are some great cameos in the film. Colm Meaney shifts gears for a comedic turn as Aldous's father, Jonathan, and he's got great chemistry with Brand. The entire sequence in which Aldous detours to Vegas for a visit with his estranged father is the funniest in the film, beginning with an awkward conversation and ending in a full-blown rock star hotel room trashing. Even Sean Combs is hilarious in the film as Sergio, head of Pinnacle and Aaron's boss. He fell right into the improve/comedy vibe and I wouldn't mind seeing Combs making further appearances in Apatow-produced comedies.Major credit needs to be given to Jason Segel, Lyle Workman, Mike Viola, and the rest who wrote original music for Infant Sorrow and Jackie Q. Seriously, the music in the film is good enough that I had to get the soundtrack. Each of the songs sounds as if it could be a legitimate rock/pop song and each of them is hilarious and often addicting. After having seen this film a few times and gotten the tunes stuck in my head, I really wish Infant Sorrow was a real band.",9,4,10,3 November 2010
Cloud Atlas," A Refreshingly Inventive Film that Spans Generations
","Aw man, I wish I hadn't missed this film during its theatrical run. We're at a point when movie studios spend the majority of their efforts on bombastic summer blockbusters that appeal to the masses (of which, I admit, I'm a member), and it's not often we get a movie where the filmmakers really get a chance to go all out in bringing their vision to life. In my opinion, CLOUD ATLAS never really stood a chance in mainstream theaters and it's a shame to see that it grossed so low in the United States. From what I can determine, your average Joe theatergoer isn't going to invest a lot of energy into following nonlinear storytelling, especially when there are six separate stories spanning five hundred years blended together into a mosaic about reincarnation of the soul and the cyclical nature of life with themes of opposing oppression and achieving one's fate. At least, that's what I took away from this movie. I believe CLOUD ATLAS is one of those films that are open to interpretation from each member of its audience. Over the course of the film, we watch as souls move from one generation to the next and observe how the actions of one generation can drastically affect generations of the future:In 1849, an American lawyer falls ill as he crosses the Pacific Ocean and befriends a stowaway slave while under the questionable care of a doctor. In 1936, an aspiring composer accepts a position as an aid to world famous musician and quietly composes his own greatest masterpiece. In 1973, a small-time journalist discovers evidence that an oil magnate might be organizing sabotage of the nuclear energy industry and endangering innocent lives. In 2012, a publisher on the run from hoodlums believes his brother has found him sanctuary in a quaint hotel in the countryside but discovers its true sinister nature. In 2144, a fabricant (clone) used for menial work in the fast food industry of Neo-Seoul escapes from her life of servitude and is shown the horrifying truth regarding the life of fabricants. And in 2321, a man of a primitive culture in the aftermath of catastrophic global events journeys to the top of a mountain where he risks facing the Devil itself to aid a friend.The first aspect of CLOUD ATLAS one is bound to notice would be that every major actor in the film plays multiple roles. The filmmakers took this angle a step further and each actor portrays characters of various races and genders. This is where things can become a bit distracting at first. The makeup effects in the film are impressive and generally seamless, but Hugo Weaving in drag is still Hugo Weaving in drag. Hard as you might try, it's hard to ignore. Thankfully, this particular instance occurs in the only real comedic story in the bunch ('The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish') so it doesn't hamper the story. Other cases don't necessarily fare as well. The 2144 tale is set in a futuristic Seoul, Korea so the characters are naturally Koreanexcept a good portion of the cast is not. I'll be honestit mostly works. It doesn't sit well for a little while but you become accustomed to it and future revisits to the movie become easier to settle in with. Some might also believe the language of the primitive islanders in the 2321 tale to be a problem. It sounds a little childish at first and it's weird hearing it spoken so earnestly by people like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry, but just like Jim Sturgess disguised as a Korean, you get used to it.Don't misunderstand me, though: these are not to be construed as problems with the film. If anything, they add flavor and I love it. And once you get past some of the oddities, this is just a really, really good movie. I love how each of the stories has their own feel and each of them ties into one another in some fashion, whether directly or indirectly. Everything here is connected, and they all share the common themes found scattered throughout the movie of rising up against the powerful and oppressive. The movie is made even more effective with some amazing casting. Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Jim Broadbent, Keith David, and many, many more populate the film. CLOUD ATLAS is a unique experience and you have to give each cast and crew member involved for coming together to create something so different from 99% of the rest of the movies released each year. My concern is that CLOUD ATLAS did so poorly in theaters that it might discourage directors from taking chances and providing us with content more creative than your average summer explosion-fest or screwball comedies. So, in an effort to bring about more films as inventive as CLOUD ATLAS, I encourage everyone to give it a chance. It's one of those films that are perfect for a post- viewing discussion.",9,4,6,9 August 2013
300," Snyder/Miller's Stylish, Bloody Battle Epic
","Here we having an epic winning combination: Zack Snyder (the 2004 re-imagining of DAWN OF THE DEAD) and Frank Miller (SIN CITY) collaborating on an epic action film based on historical events. The film adapted from Miller's graphic novel and, as I've discovered, Snyder was as accurate as possible while using the novel itself for the film's storyboards. In doing such, he has managed to capture the style of the source material perfectly and bring it to life. The film depicts the Battle of Thermopylae in which King Leonidas of Sparta led 300 soldiers against 1 million Persians, led by Xerxes in his quest to further expand his empire.The first thing I should mention (and I'm surprised I should even have to mention this): this is NOT a documentary and therefore is NOT 100% historically accurate. I've seen others slamming the movie because the film does not depict the events with complete accuracy. This is a film based on Frank Miller's stylized envisioning of the battle and it is a fiction film. So, watch it for fun and not for a research paper and you're in good shape. This film is a blast, loaded with stylish battles against in which the Spartan warriors take down everything the Persians have to throw at the Spartans, everything going well until they are ultimately betrayed. Bloody violence, hideous creatures, and slow motion to emphasize all the right moments...this is probably my favorite sword-n-sandals battle.Gerard Butler is King Leonidas and he shows his potential to become one of modern cinemas great action stars. His Leonidas is a gritty, honor-driven warrior who is still able to show tenderness to his wife, Queen Gorgo (the beautiful Lena Headey). The majority of the supporting cast are interchangeable and you'll find yourself unable to determine who's who under the helmets and capes, though Rodrigo Santoro is an imposing presence as Xerxes. So, if you're in the mood for a creatively violent two hours and you're a fan of Frank Miller's storytelling, 300 will not disappoint.",9,1,1,29 December 2009
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Surprise Hit and Perfect Start to 2015's Slate of Spy Films
","I am a major unapologetic fan of the James Bond franchise and, as much as I love the latest serious Daniel Craig run of the series, KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE is apparently the 007 film I've been craving since Roger Moore finished his run in 1985. It takes all the most playful elements of Moore's 007 films, gives them modern sensibilities, and ramps up the stylized action under the direction of Matthew Vaughn. I've enjoyed Vaughn's work since LAYER CAKE and I'll admit I was worried about KINGSMAN. Leading up to its release, I'd seen little to no promotion for it and it was apparently based on a comic property with which I was unfamiliar. To top it off, it was scheduled for release in the month of February, a notorious cinematic dumping ground. But, man, I was wrong to doubt it. Turns out, KINGSMAN is one of my favorite movies of 2015, a year swamped with spy films. The Kingsman are a secret organization of wealthy gentlemen dating nearly a century and their mission is to keep the world safe from danger utilizing seemingly endless resources. Cool gadgets and impeccable style without the hindrance of answering to the government and MI6. Each agent is code- named for one of the knights in King Arthur's court, and they operate out of a tailor shop on Savile Row in London. As the movie begins, a threat emerges in the form of a world-famous tech billionaire whose plan for saving the world from environmental destruction means eliminating its over-population problem.It all begins with the kidnapping of a famed environmental scientist/university professor, played by none other than Mark Hamill. A botched rescue attempt leaves a Kingsman agent dead and we then jump into the process of finding a new Lancelot. Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) recruits young Gary 'Eggsy' Unwin (Taron Egerton) and convinces him to go through the recruitment campaign where he will compete with nearly a dozen other candidates for the position. This proves to be a challenge for Eggsy, as he's a street thug (albeit one with above average intelligence and Olympic-level gymnastic skills) going up against Ivy Leaguers with stiff upper lips and wealthy backgrounds. Hart feels compelled to care for Eggsy because it was Eggsy's father that saved his life by giving his own on a mission years earlier in the Middle East. Hart becomes a sort of surrogate father to Eggsy, teaching him in the ways of acting a gentleman and giving the kid confidence to compete. Firth and Egerton are a solid team in the film, and Firth's performance leads me to believe he could've been a fantastic 007 if he'd been given the chance. With support from Mark Strong as the Kingsman's tech wizard Merlin and Michael Caine as the commanding officer of the organization (dubbed Arthur, naturally), this movie's got some serious acting chops in it. But a proper spy/action film is only as strong as its villain and, when that villain is Samuel L. Jackson, you know it's going to be fun.KINSGMAN has a perfect blend of action and humor. It's definitely a lot edgier in the comedy than 007 films have ever been, seeing as how KINGSMAN totally embraces its R-rating. At the end of a 007 film, we get a tender embrace under the sheets, a cheesy pun, and an 'Oh, James' from the leading lady. In KINGSMAN, the gorgeous woman prepares for mounting like a dog in heat because, well, he did save the world as promised. This movie is a jacked-up love letter to the fun 007 movies of the Connery and Moore eras, parodying elements with a knowing nod and taking everything a step further because they can. The violence certainly takes full advantage of the R-rating, with a church slaughter halfway through the film spilling loads of blood and establishing itself as the most fun scene of any movie in 2015 (fantastically set to the tune of Lynyrd Skynyrd's 'Freebird'). The Kingsman may not appear to be much of a threat in their tailored suits with their proper manners, but these dudes can open a can of whoop a**. I would never expect much from Colin Firth but he's got a few scenes in this movie proving that Galahad is not a man to be trifled with. I could go on about KINGSMAN but I'll sum it up with this: the movie is just a crazy amount of fun and there is extra enjoyment to be had for fans of classic 007 who'll see a lot of the tropes toyed with here.One last note: I really, really hope KINGSMAN 2 brings in Roger Moore in a supporting role, either as the villain or the head of the Kingsman. It would just be perfect.",9,4,7,22 January 2016
The Hangover Part III," A Fitting End to the Adventures of the Wolf Pack
","Who would've thought the surprise comedy hit of the summer of 2009 would go on to become a full-blown trilogy? It's a baffling prospect because each film became progressively less successful as the series continued until THE HANGOVER PART III found itself lucky to squeak by with enough domestic box office to recoup its budget. I loved the first film, and I wasn't as hard on the second one as most other people were. I was disappointed that the filmmakers felt the need to adhere so close (insultingly close) to the pattern of the first film in an effort to mimic its success for the second film, but I was happy to find it breaking away from the mold for the third and final film. Of course, by the time part three was released in 2013, most people had grown tired of the shtick and it was lucky that it didn't totally tank. The third adventure of the infamous Wolf Pack finds Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Doug (Justin Bartha) confronting Allen (Zach Galifianakis) about his reckless insanity and convincing him to enter a clinic to help him balance out. En route, they're hijacked by crime boss Marshall (John Goodman). You see, Leslie Chow stole millions of dollars worth of gold from Marshall and he believes the Wolf Pack is his best chance of finding him. Kidnapping Doug as collateral (because what's a HANGOVER movie if Doug's part of the team?), he gives the guys a deadline and tells them to bring him Chowor else.Personally, I'm not sure what people hated so much about this movie. I actually liked it. It's a refreshing break from the formula of the first two and takes itself a little more seriously than the second film. Whereas the second movie was sort of a parody of the first movie, taking it to new extremes while rehashing a lot of the same gags with a wink to the audience and an oh-no-not-again vibe, THE HANGOVER PART III is more original and gives it's characters more to do than stumble from one clue to another. Ken Jeong's now iconic character of Leslie Chow has gone much farther than I ever anticipated he would as he's gone from an amusing addition to the first film to being the focal point of the final film. This means we get plenty more of his loud, obnoxious, flamboyant style. So, if Chow was your least favorite part of the previous films, you'll want to skip this one because we get plenty more. And, yes, you get the obligatory full frontal Jeong shot if you stick around too long after the end credits begin to roll. At this point, I think it's written into his contract. Chow must be a fan favorite; I can see them making a movie centered on him to keep the interest alive long enough to profit from the final film. It works well enough. I don't hate the Chow character and he's a little more toned down in PART III, going for more bizarre and threatening and less in-your-face loud.John Goodman is a nice surprise as the villain, Marshall. He doesn't really have much to do beside yelling and threatening people. Goodman's good at that sort of thing, so he's a nice fit. Melissa McCarthy is on a roll right now, so she's got a minor part as a love interest for Allen. Yeah, you read that right. Honestly, I can't think of anyone else who could've played an odd enough character to match wits (or witlessness) with Allen. And then we have a bunch of returning cameos from the first movie. Director Todd Phillips tries to bring it all full circle with the Wolf Pack returning to where it all began and encountering familiar faces along the way. And he does it all with a fresh approach. I can appreciate that and I think that's why I enjoyed this movie so much more than most other people. The HANGOVER movies, at their best and worst, are redeemed in the interactions between the three buddies at the center of the adventures: Phil, Stu, and Allen. They've got a great chemistry and that's why, even at its lows, these movies are fun for me. Turning THE HANGOVER into a trilogy might not have been the best idea but it wasn't the worst and each movie has enough of it's own flavor to make them entertaining. THE HANGOVER PART III is a fine end to the adventures of the Wolf Pack and I think we can, at the very least, be glad this one didn't start with a bachelor party and roofies.",8,0,1,25 January 2014
Pineapple Express," One of the Greatest Stoner Film
","The Apatow crew have brought us the funniest film in 2008. Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, their follow-up to 2007's 'Superbad' is one of their best films so far. In the film, process server/pothead Dale Denton (Rogen) and his drug dealer Saul Silver (James Franco) must go on the run after Dale witnesses a local drug lord murdering the competition. The filmmakers have succeeded in creating the first great weed action/comedy, blending fun action with Rogen and Goldberg's usual style of comedy.I continue to find Seth Rogen to be one of the funniest actors in modern movies. I've loved him in every movie I've seen him in with his goof-ball style and off-kilter improv. Considering I had only seen James Franco in his role in the Spider-Man franchise, I wasn't sure how to take his casting in an Apatow comedy. I thought he was pretty good in Raimi's films (well, except his villainous turn in the third...Franco should avoid bad guy roles), but I hadn't seen him do comedy. To my surprise, he was a perfect choice to play opposite Rogen. The two had great chemistry and I actually thought Franco outshone Rogen a bit in this film. I want to see Franco in more comedies! He really needs to become a regular in Apatow's crew in the future. Another shining spot in the film was Danny McBride as Red, Saul's supplier. I had seen McBride in the hilarious 'Tropic Thunder' and the amusing (but less-than-stellar) 'Hot Rod' and he is on par with Rogen as a great Hollywood funny-man. Toss in performances by the great Gary Cole and Apatow-regular Craig Robinson and this film's loaded with some hilarious people.The film has the same low-brow brand of comedy as 'Superbad' but it never gets stale. Rogen and Goldberg know how to do comedy better than a lot of other Hollywood writers out there, and now we know they can do action if they want to. There isn't a great deal of action in the movie but the few action scenes are great. One of my favorite sequences in the film is when Saul 'saves' Dale when he believes he has been arrested by a corrupt cop, leading into a hilarious car chase. As I said, this is the funniest film of 2008 in my opinion and I'm really hoping it's success will continue to give Rogen and Goldberg the freedom to create the films they want. They haven't let me down yet.",9,0,2,23 January 2009
Jackie Brown," Quentin Tarantino & Elmore Leonard, a Great Combination
","I personally think Quentin Tarantino's third feature film was under-rated. Most people seem to think of it as his weakest film to date but I disagree. I definitely wouldn't go so far as to say it's his best; it's got nothing on 'Pulp Fiction' but it's still a great movie in it's own ways. I found myself somewhat let down after watching it the first time because I originally expected another 'Pulp Fiction', which it wasn't intended to be. It's an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel 'Rum Punch' (a pretty faithful adaptation) and a bit of an homage to the blaxploitation movies of the 70's. The movie follows the title character, Jackie Brown (played by 70's blaxploitation icon Pam Grier), a middle-aged flight attendant who runs money to/from Mexico for gun runner Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson, super-cool as always). After Jackie's caught bringing $50 grand and a bag of cocaine into the country, she finds herself making a deal with ATF agent Ray Nicolette (a twitchy, entertaining Michael Keaton) and trying to scam both Ordell and the ATF while walking away with a half-million dollar payload.The film continues to display Tarantino's strengths as a filmmaker. He once again displays a knack for perfect casting. Grier gives a strong performance as the down-on-her-luck Jackie who's ready to risk everything to escape her menial life. Robert Forster (another icon from 70's and 80's B-movies) puts in a great supporting performance as bail bondsman Max Cherry, Jackie's only real accomplice. Oddly enough, one of my favorite performances in the film was Robert De Niro as Ordell's new partner, ex-con Louis Gara. He's only a supporting member and doesn't really even much dialogue or purpose until the final act but he's fun to watch. Louis is such a subdued person, not the type of role I'm used to seeing De Niro in. Louis's character is all in his body language and it's awesome to see De Niro playing such an awkward person. Rounding out the primary cast is Bridget Fonda as Ordell's stoned surfer girl Melanie, providing a small but somewhat vital role.In addition to his ability to find the perfect actor/actress for each role, Tarantino once again shows he knows how to create a film's atmosphere with a great soundtrack. The music is practically it's own character in the film, using 70's soul and R&B to add to the film's flavor. With tracks by Bobby Womack, the Grass Roots, and the Brothers Johnson, this film has one of my favorite soundtracks in recent years.The movie runs a bit long (roughly 2.5 hours) but it generally doesn't drag. There are a couple points where you start to feel the long running time wearing on you, but it usually passes as the plot once again grabs you with another interesting turn. The story can be a bit complex as the characters plot, double, and triple-cross each other but it leaves you satisfied by the end (though, I admit, I thought the climax was a bit weak). The movie combines a cool crime story from Elmore Leonard with the cinema stylings of Quentin Tarantino. While it does have a couple weaknesses, it's still a great follow-up to 'Pulp Fiction' and in my opinion shows that Tarantino is one our strongest modern filmmakers.",8,0,1,30 April 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A Comedy Legend; I Love It
","I've noticed that Monty Python is one of the most polarizing franchises I've encountered. A lot of people I know either love it or hate it, with few falling somewhere in between. I consider myself a casual fan. I've seen some of the television series, and I absolutely love HOLY GRAIL. For the record, I've never seen LIFE OF BRIAN and I've only seen bits and pieces of MEANING OF LIFE (and it didn't grab me the same way HOLY GRAIL did). Honestly, the first time I saw this movie I didn't really care for it. Absurdist humor hadn't really been my thing at the time, but the movie grew on me. Next thing I knew, I was buying my own copy, watching it multiple times, and planning on seeking out the rest of the Monty Python films. What's the movie about? It's all right there in the title: the story of the Holy Grail as seen through the eyes of some of the funniest men to come out of Britain. King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is tasked by God to search the lands for the mystical Holy Grail. Aiding him in his quest are Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Bedevere, Sir Galahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and their quest will take them to the far reaches of the land where they will encounter beautiful maidens, dangerous evils, and, well, the French. The whole movie is as if a Monty Python sketch was extended to a feature runtime, but unlike an SNL skit receiving the same treatment, it works.This movie is hilarious. That's all there is to it. I've watched it a half dozen times and it never gets old. It ages perfectly, too. It may have been made in the mid-70s, but the fact that it's meant to be a goofy low-budget comedy means that aging special effects don't mean a thing as long as it continues to make people laugh. Even people who haven't seen the movie have probably heard its dialogue quoted ad nauseam (''Tis but a scratch!') or would recognize the Knights Who Say Ni! Skip around the lawn while clacking a couple of empty coconut shells and most people will get the joke, while the rest will probably just think you've lost your mind. MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a classic at the pinnacle of many top ten lists for favorite comedies. Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin are comedic geniuses. You've got to give them serious credit for being able to put together such a hilarious film while at the same time doing 99% of the speaking roles in the films themselves. There isn't a whole lot I can say about this movie short of showering it with love. Anyone who's a fan of the most absurd British humor will (or more likely already have) fallen in love with this movie. Beware the Black Beast of Aaaaauuuugggggghhh and don't go trusting seemingly innocent white rabbits.",9,1,2,23 February 2012
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Easily the greatest of the 'Star Wars' saga...
","This is probably the greatest sequel to ever come out of Hollywood. Continuing the story of the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire, this film takes place a few years after the destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader hunts for the hidden Rebels while Luke is given the task to continue his Jedi training under the guide of Yoda. This film takes a darker, more mature path than its predecessor.Irvin Kershner takes the reigns of this film, with George Lucas producing. I personally believe Kershner did an standout job with the characters in this film (and it seems like he had a blast while doing it). The film-making team in this movie really works and I only wish they had gotten together to make the prequel trilogy. The visuals in this movie are some of most gorgeous I've seen (or maybe I'm just biased). My eyes still grow wide every time I watch the scenes on the ice planet, Hoth.The entire cast from 'Star Wars' returns for the sequel. Once again, we are treated to excellent performances from Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, etc. This film also marks the introduction of Billy Dee Williams to the series as Han's friend Lando Calrissian, and Frank Oz as Yoda. As there is a lot more dialogue in this movie (especially between Luke and Yoda), it is important to really care for these characters. This is made easy as the movie pulls you right in, engrossing you in the storyline.Though sequels are generally looked down upon, it is movies like this that show that there is hope for them. This is easily the best of the trilogy. While I wish I had more to say for 'The Empire Strikes Back', I find myself with very little. For those who are new to the series, be sure to watch 'A New Hope' first, but know that you have a lot to look forward to in the sequel.",10,0,1,19 May 2005
Sin City," One of my top favorites...
","Robert Rodriguez scores again! This man is neck-and-neck with Quentin Tarantino as being my favorite filmmaker. It seems like the man can't fail. This time around, Rodriguez brings Frank Miller's film noir graphic novel series 'Sin City'. For those wondering if you need to be a reader of the books to enjoy the movie, you don't. I went into this movie blind when I saw it in the theaters and it blew me away. The movie actually inspired me to start reading the books.The movie is a collection of stories from three of the graphic novels. I think this is where some viewers got confused. A lot of the people I spoke with regarding the movie didn't care for it because 'it didn't make sense'. People need to know: don't go into this expecting a two-hour, single plot movie!! It is three stories, independent of each other, that share the same characters. In this way, it is like Tarantino's 'Pulp Fiction'. Another concern people have with the movie is the gratuitous violence and sexual themes. This movie may not be for people who are easily offended by such things or are made uncomfortable. You need to watch this movie with an open mind and just try to enjoy the stories.And of course, you can't discuss 'Sin City' without mentioning the stylized look of the film. The movie is gorgeous, shot almost completely against a green-screen and using digital backgrounds. The use of the green-screen also allowed Rodriguez to do some amazing lighting that could not be achieved through conventional film-making. It gives the movie a look that hasn't been seen before. After reading Miller's first book in the series ('The Hard Goodbye', which is also the first story in the movie), you can see that Rodriguez stayed as true as possible to the look in the books.Finally, I have to mention the casting. I couldn't imagine a better cast to play these characters. You can tell the actors/actresses really got into their characters and had a great time playing them. They all gave strong performances and brought these characters to life perfectly.",10,1,2,1 February 2006
The Cabin in the Woods," Sharp, Hilarious Deconstruction of Horror Clichés
","I suppose 2012 is just the year when Joss Whedon (SERENITY) was due to breakout as a major force in Hollywood. Not one, but two awesome movies in the same summer. One is an epic level comic book superhero team. The other is a teasingly loving satire of the modern horror/slasher movie genre. Whedon didn't direct THE CABIN IN THE WOODS, but he did produce and co-write with director Drew Goddard, frequent Whedon collaborator and writer of the (in my opinion) under-appreciated CLOVERFIELD. Let's face it: a lot of the horror movies of the past 20 years or so have utilized the same ignorant clichés. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. But there are elements that we find in just about all of them. My favorite 'horror' movies are the ones that poke holes in the conventions we've come to expect from the genre, even if they're more funny than scary. In 2010 we had TUCKER & DALE VS EVIL, now we have THE CABIN IN THE WOODS. Both are awesome, and Whedon/Goddard's movie is easily one of my favorites for 2012. The plot of the movie is one we've seen dozens and dozens of times, it's how the filmmakers turned it on its head that's great. The premise: five college age students pack themselves into an RV and head into the wilderness for some fun. They've gained access to a remote cabin in the woods where they're hoping to engage in a little drunken debauchery. As anyone who's familiar with horror films knows, this means certain doom but what these kids don't know is that there is someone behind the scenes pulling the strings and nothing is as it seems.This is one of those movies where the less said, the better. You want to go into this movie knowing as little as possible, so do your best to avoid spoilers before checking it out. The fun of the movie is the ridiculous premise and how Whedon and Goddard have a blast with it. I hadn't even watched a trailer for this movie before I finally saw it. I'd heard through enough reviews that it was a 'must-see' and watched it with a clean slate. I will go so far as to assure that this movie delivers on both laughs andwell, not really scares. Unless you're just terrified of gore, of which this movie has more than enough. It goes to KILL BILL levels of splatter at times. All done in good fun, of course. I'm hesitant to even call THE CABIN IN THE WOODS a horror movie. It's got some tense moments but there's nothing really scary going on here. Everything that should be considered 'horror' is so familiar that I'm totally desensitized to it all. Mutilated pain-worshipping zombie rednecks? Meh, seen it. Decapitations, stabbings, disembowelmentnothing I haven't seen before. But the comedy here, freaking hilarious. The writing, the casting, and even some of the practical effects used in the movie combine into one of the funniest movies of the year.There both familiar and unfamiliar faces here. Probably the most recognizable at this point is Chris Hemsworth even though this movie was shot before THOR and SNOW WHITE & THE HUNTSMAN. Hemsworth is great filling out the role of the alpha male athlete of the students with, of course, some differences from the usual abusive jock. The rest of the kids are great: Kristen Connolly, Anna Hutchison, and Jesse Williams. The best part of the movie, and I knew it from the moment he was introduced driving onto the scene with a giant bong that collapses into a coffee mug, is Fran Kranz as stoner Marty. He became my favorite character the moment he came on screen. Stoic, intelligent, and stoned out of his mindhe's the funniest of the group. Still, a lot of the funniest moments don't even happen in the titular cabin. The show stealers in this film are Richard Jenkins (BURN AFTER READING, THE RUM DIARY) and Bradley Whitford (who, despite being incredibly familiar, has starred in a bunch of stuff I've never seen). Jenkins and Whitford are a couple of technicians sitting at a console in a bunker at an undisclosed location with the fate of the world in their hands. And they're having a great time. I probably could've watched an entire movie based solely on these two men doing their jobs in this mysterious organization. All of these elements come together as one of the funniest movies I've seen this year and a sharp joke at the expense of the horror movies flooding theaters and home video.So I can't recommend this movie highly enough and, whatever you do, don't touch the conch.",9,0,2,16 December 2012
Spectre," SPECTRE's Return Isn't the Strongest but...
","In a year that saw a brand new Star Wars, a return to Jurassic Park (well, World), and the second gathering of Marvel's Avengers, SPECTRE was my most anticipated film. While others would clamor over a new FORCE AWAKENS trailer, I was tracking early reviews for SPECTRE, hoping to see overwhelming good news for James Bond's twenty-fourth cinematic mission. I am an unapologetic 007 fan who finds even the weakest of the franchise's entries to be worth multiple viewings. I guess what I'm trying to say is my opinion is notably biased and those who aren't on the same level should probably deduct a point from my score for a more realistic grading. SPECTRE was a big deal in the world of 007; it was the first time since DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER in 1971 that Bond would find himself at odds with the evil organization since a legal dispute had the rights out of Eon Production's hands. And those of us who are excited at the idea of SPECTRE's (or just Spectre, since it's no longer an acronym) return know exactly whom it brings with it. The movie begins with 007 (Daniel Craig, in his fourth run as the secret agent) completing a more personal mission in Mexico as a final request for a respected friend. This leads him to discover a powerful organization that meets in secret and appears to have sinister influence over world events. The head of this cabal is a ghost from Bond's past, believed long dead.I've been wishing for the return of Spectre since Le Chiffre was revealed to have been a pawn of the secret organization Quantum in CASINO ROYALE. I always hoped Quantum would've been revealed as a business front or subsidiary of Spectre (one of the tentacles, you know) and it's great to finally see that come to light. In fact, not only was Spectre behind Quantum but it was also the evil puppetmaster behind each of Daniel Craig's Bond films. That almost sounds cool until you remember that Raoul Silva felt more appropriate as a man on a mission of personal vengeance and not a Spectre operative. This is one of a handful of the chinks in the armor of SPECTRE. I really wanted this movie to be the best Daniel Craig/007 movie yet but I have to acknowledge it has its issues. At two and a half hours, the movie's slower pace becomes problematic. There is a fantastic sequence on a Spectre compound in Morocco that would've served as a fantastic finale if fleshed out a little more, but SPECTRE instead returns to London for an additional half hour that ends the movie with a fizzle. I also wish the movie had utilized Christoph Waltz more. He gets a great introduction early in the film in Rome and then disappears until nearly two hours into the film. His screen time is depressingly small and I hope that means he'll get the screen time he deserves in his next contracted film.Yes, SPECTRE was somewhat disappointing but that doesn't mean there isn't a decent 007 adventure underneath the problems. This was the closest in feel the Craig era has come to a more traditional 007 film. It doesn't take itself as seriously as the previous three films, allowing for the occasional one-liner or visual gag. There's a moment in the opening sequence where Bond is falling through a collapsing building and lands safely on a couch in a bit that would've been at home in the Roger Moore era and there's even a gadget gag when 007 is racing through the streets of Rome in the new Aston Martin DB10. Speaking of classic 007, I was thrilled to see the movie open with the gun barrel sequence. I've missed that. Daniel Craig is still my favorite James Bond and now we have perfect casting in his arch-nemesis in the form of Christoph Waltz. Waltz's casting was absolutely perfect; my excitement for this movie skyrocketed when it was announced. I loved the little nod to Fleming's original 'Octopussy' short story with the name of Franz Oberhauser, though I think we all knew what to truly expect in a movie titled SPECTRE and, again, Waltz's perfect casting. Léa Seydoux makes for a fine addition to the 'Bond woman' legacy as Madeleine Swann, a strong woman with ties to Bond's previous missions. I felt like the two of them didn't have a strong enough chemistry to justify how the movie ended, but at least it sets up an interesting sequel.SPECTRE wasn't exactly the 007 adventure I was hoping for but it's a suitable addition to the franchise. It has some great moments and pays some extra homage to the movies that came before. It's wonderful to have Spectre back in the game and, while I'd have preferred it be about 30 minutes shorter, it's another decent entry in the Daniel Craig era.",7,0,1,26 October 2016
Moon," A Science Fiction Gem
","It's great when a filmmaker comes along that realizes science fiction doesn't necessarily need to revolve around alien invasions, giant CG spectacles, or flashy lightsaber battles (sorry). The best science fiction poses questions about the future of mankind and the decisions we as a species may be confronted with. It gives us cause to examine our path and where it might lead us. First-time feature director Duncan Jones (son of the legendary David Bowie) has done just that with MOON. The story begins in a not-too-distant future where mankind has begun harvesting helium-3 from the surface of the moon as a potent, clean energy source. Seeing as how most of the operation is automated, the lunar base has a single man on staff: Sam Bell. With the satellite uplink to Earth non-operational, Sam's only form of personal contact is with the station A.I., GERTY. As Sam is approaching the end of his three-year contract and his chance to return home, there is an accident and Sam is injured when colliding with a harvester. He awakens in the midst of some strange goings-on that I'm going to do my best not to spoil here.I really love this movie. It's so rare that a film can inspire as much thought as MOON anymore. The film presents questions of individuality and human rights in regards to how they apply to cloning. It's an intriguing topic that can make for some excellent post-movie discussion. Duncan Jones has brought us an excellent science fiction film in rare form. The trailers for this film might mislead some who go into this movie expecting a thriller. The ads for the film give it a SIXTH SENSE feel with hints of the supernatural, but there is nothing of the sort. The big reveal comes less than halfway through the movie, so it doesn't keep you guessing throughout to find some big answer. It presents you with the situation early on so that the audience is given ample time to understand what exactly it is Sam Bell is going through. I admit GERTY gives off a bit of a HAL-9000 vibe, but this is not just another in a long line of films about technology gone wrong. It's an insightful glimpse into a future where humans will need to carefully consider their options in biogenetics. In other words, this movie is not going to be for everyone.After finally talking some of my friends in watching the movie, one of the biggest complaints I got throughout was how incredibly slow the movie moved. I can't argue with that. This is a very slow, deliberately paced movie. At only an hour and a half, it feels much longer. That's fine. I can deal with that. It's a great story so I don't mind if it takes it's time establishing itself. I'm sure the movie never would've worked as well if they hadn't casted it so well. MOON is the film that officially established Sam Rockwell as one of my favorite modern actors. Keep in mind, Rockwell is the only actor on screen throughout the course of the movie. He has no one to play off except himself and GERTY (voiced in a haunting monotone by Kevin Spacey). I love these sorts of films and I think it says a lot about an actor when they are the sole character for a feature length film and pull it off. Sam Rockwell's fantastic performance, slick production design, and an engaging, thought-provoking story: MOON is an excellent piece of independent work and it has established Duncan Jones as a director to watch.",9,2,10,6 October 2011
The Nice Guys," THE NICE GUYS Deserves a Lot More Love
","The most overlooked, underrated movie from 2016 was, without a doubt, THE NICE GUYS. I saw it in theaters on the weekend after it opened in a small theater with no more than a dozen people total. The box office numbers for THE NICE GUYS were depressingly low, being siphoned away to the swarm of big budget blockbusters that, let's face it, weren't all that impressive that summer. I treated myself to a double feature that afternoon, starting with the latest X-MEN and closing out with THE NICE GUYS. Needless to say, Shane Black's retro detective buddy comedy was the far superior film and I just wish more people had given it the attention it deserved. We've got superhero movies hitting us from every direction; we've rebooting reboots; we're regurgitating old properties and turning toy brands into franchises. So when an amazing, original movie like THE NICE GUYS comes along we need to pay attention and give it the love it deserves. Why are we wasting theater space on yet another tired TRANSFORMERS installment but my chances of getting another round with March and Healy are low-to-none? I think the only, and I mean only, mistake this movie made was being released in May at the start of the summer movie season. If the studios have played it smart and released it in the winter when audiences aren't bombarded with two and a half hour CG explosions, this movie might've gotten the love it deserved. Because this movie is awesome.It's set in the '70s Los Angeles in the midst of the national gas crisis. Holland March (Ryan Gosling) is a sleazy private detective who finds himself teaming with the more honorable hired muscle Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe) in getting to the bottom of a mystery revolving around a missing girl and a dead porn actress. THE NICE GUYS is equal parts action and comedy, with Gosling and Crowe giving what are probably my favorite performances from two actors I don't generally associate with comedy. March is an alcoholic who's still reeling from the death of his wife. He's raising his daughter Holly (Angourie Rice) alone and makes a living pursuing the sort of cases that might involve ripping off old ladies for on-going payments. Healy is a loner, living above a club with only his aquarium for company, who'll put the hurting on troublemakers for the right amount of cash. The two cross paths when Healy is hired to 'send a message' to March to stop trailing a frightened young girl named Amelia (she's a person of interest in March's case). Soon Amelia goes missing and a couple of thugs (including Keith David because, as I mentioned, this movie is awesome) come terrorizing Healy in search of her; Healy recognizes there's someone with more sinister intentions pursing this girl and he turns to March for help in locating her. March reluctantly agrees and we're off on one of the best buddy action/comedies in decades from the writer of LETHAL WEAPON.The writing is sharp. The laughs are consistent. The action is brutal. THE NICE GUYS succeeds on every level. I would've never pegged Gosling or Crowe for these sort of semi-comedic roles but they nail it. I want to see a sequel with March and Healy on their first official case as a professional investigation duo, with Holly tagging along despite the mens' warnings in sort of a 'Penny in Inspector Gadget' role. Holly is precocious for her age and acts as March's unofficial partner, meaning she's the sober one and keeps him on track. Angourie Rice keeps pace with the heavier hitters of the film and never falls into the pitfall of being 'the annoying child actor' who ruins an otherwise fantastic movie. She's just as vital a team member. The conspiracy uncovered by the trio is complex without being convoluted and it makes for an interesting story built around the legitimate gas crisis the United States encountered in the era. It's a fun period piece from a fun period. We don't get enough period pieces from the '60s or '70s anymore so I love it when one comes along and, even better, when it's done well. THE NICE GUYS has everything you could want and I don't want to spoil much of anything so I'm trying to be sparse with the details, but I really encourage you to check this movie out if you haven't. By the end, I imagine you'll be aching for another go with the Nice Guys P.I.s as much as I am.",9,1,2,26 August 2017
Mad Max: Fury Road," High Octane Insanity - An Absolute Blast!
","As of now, I have never seen the Mel Gibson/Mad Max film series. I knew of them, growing up, but didn't know much beyond Mel Gibson, the word Thunderdome, and Tina Turner having a role in one of the films (which I have since learned was the aforementioned Thunderdome). I had zero interest in the news that there was a new film coming from George Miller but the trailer and the onslaught of positive reviews got me curious enough that I found myself in the theater for FURY ROAD. And, wow, it was as nuts as everyone said. Sadly, I still haven't gone back to check out the Gibson series but now I'm anxious to do so. Still, I went in to this movie blind, knowing only the main character's name (obviously) and that he drives a sweet looking car through the desert. FURY ROAD didn't care; it gave me all the information a newbie like me needs to get caught up and enjoy the craziness. Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) is a loner, drifting through the post-apocalyptic wasteland, apparently trying to avoid getting caught up in all the end-of-the-world lunacy since he's had a few too many close acquaintances die on his watch. It's ruined within moments of the film's opening when he's chased down and captured by a party of War Boys from the nearby Citadel, a desert oasis set inside a massive rock formation that's ruled through cruelty by Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne). When Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe's prized Imperators, betrays him, Max sees his opportunity to get out.FURY ROAD is insane; it's nearly two hours of mind-blowing action and car chases. We spend the first half or so of the movie on a massive car chase into the desert and the second half on a massive car chase back, with a few pauses at the very beginning and the middle for straight exposition. With no context, that sounds absolutely horrible: just two straight hours of guns and explosions and cars flipping and revving engines. On the contrary, George Miller (and this is where I feel he got robbed on the Best Director loss at the Academy Awards) tells a coherent, engaging story in a world that, while it is still Earth, is near unrecognizable to our own. I don't know what Immortan means. Or Imperator. But it's not important because I learn enough from film that I'm not bogged down with questions. Immortan Joe is the villain; Furiosa was some sort of lieutenant. She hates his guts and formulates an escape plan where she can steal his five beloved wives and they'll all run away together to this mystical 'green place' where they can live happily ever after. Fortunately, Max becomes involved and uses his skills at murdering people awesomely to help them on their quest. You would generally assume movies of nonstop action to be mindless spectacles (*cough* Michael Bay *cough*) but Miller never forgets that an action movie is still a movie, and movies tell stories that will draw audiences in. In that sense, this isn't really a 'Mad Max' movieFuriosa is, to me, the actual protagonist of FURY ROAD. It's her journey. Her mission. We sympathize with her; we cheer her on. Max is just along for the ride. But that isn't to cheapen Tom Hardy's role in the movie. Hardy does a fantastic job with a character who's motivations are delivered through haunting flashes of memories and who's main form of communication is monosyllabic utterances. He is a major supporting role in FURY ROAD but this is Furiosa's show 100% and Charlize Theron nails it. Really, everyone does. No one in this movie is giving less than 110%, cast and crew alike. Even Rosie Huntington-Whitely, whom I've only ever seen flashing skin in the third TRANSFORMERS movie, proves that she can do wonders with the right material. She can act! If only certain other directors utilized her as more than eye candy (*cough* Michael Bay *cough*). Enough of the cast, though. Seriously, the action in this movie is bonkers. And there's none of that shaky- cam, 'can't tell what's going on' camera style here. We're talking wide shots, full view, of practical stunts with metal beasts. There's a reason FURY ROAD won pretty much all of the production awards for which it was nominated. This movie looks amazing. The stunts are amazing. The cast are amazing. And it's a total blast to watch. If I would muster one complaint, it's that the movie pauses oh-so-briefly in the middle to let us catch our breath. MAD MAX: FURY ROAD was the biggest surprise in 2015 and a must-watch for all.",9,3,13,22 March 2016
The Runaways," Rock-N-Roll Biopic Has Nothing New to Offer
","THE RUNAWAYS chronicles the run of one of the most successful all-girl rock bands of all time. The film is based on 'Neon Angel', the autobiography of the band's original lead singer Cherie Currie, and it gives us a glimpse into the world of rock and roll as seen from the perspective of a group of teenage girls on their way to super-stardom. I had heard some good things about the film when it was first making the festival circuit, but I wasn't as impressed when I finally got a chance to see it myself. The cast did an amazing job in their roles but the film wasn't as great as it probably could have been.The problem with music biopics, particularly for rock stars, is that most rock stars seem to encounter the same problems: sex, drugs, booze, addiction, conflicting personalities, etc. So we get a lot of repetition with each rock star film and RUNAWAYS is no different. Cherie's decline into addiction, the in-band conflicts, the initial excitement of success and the eventual succumbing to the stress and strain of maintaining the lifestyle. It's nothing we haven't seen before in other films, it's just happening to younger characters. It's fine though because the performances are strong enough that it's easy to forget that the material's nothing new. My main problem with the film was that it came across as unstructured. It felt as if the filmmakers had just strung along random interesting events in the Runaways history and it made it feel like the movie was just wandering along. As a result, the movie loses it's momentum after their first major gig and drags through the last half. It begins around the time Cherie begins to lose control which is a shame; I should be concerned for her character, not bored by the meandering storyline.The film's saving grace is the cast. Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon did an amazing job. Kristen Stewart has earned some major credibility with me thanks to this film. I was concerned that a girl famous for her role in the TWILIGHT saga would ruin such an iconic role (Joan Jett) but she did a fantastic job and seemed to embody her perfectly. Dakota Fanning is Cherie and I've always thought of Fanning as one of the most talented young stars in Hollywood. She provides an innocence in Cherie's character at the start that makes the film interesting to watch when her stardom warps and destroys it. Shannon is the group's manager Kim Fowley. Fowley is apparently infamous for his aggressive style, and his training sessions with the Runaways are the best parts of the film.You can't have a music film without the music that inspired it and the soundtrack to the film is awesome. It's loaded with music from the Runaways and Joan's later solo run. The filmmaker's transport you back to the late 70s with their dedication to the style, from the clothes to the music and the fads. The movie has all the ingredients to make a great bio movie, but the execution prevents it from rising to what it could've been.",7,10,14,20 September 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," A Major Improvement Over FALLEN
","REVENGE OF THE FALLEN was an abomination. Seriously, it was crap. I was a fan of the first TRANFORMERS movie, but the second was almost enough for me to write off the series completely. Now, I understood that there was a lot of behind-the-scenes trouble during the second movie's development/production, so when the time came that the third movie, DARK OF THE MOON, was to be released I could barely muster any interest. I almost passed on it, but I enjoyed the first movie enough and the reviews coming out claiming that the third film was actually decent blockbuster fodder convinced me to give it a shot. I did, and I'm happy to say that it was a lot better than I expected. Not good enough to rank as one of the best movies of 2011, but fun enough that I haven't totally given up hope on the franchise (because let's be honest, this series isn't done yetnot while it keeps making bank at the box office). In this movie, it's explained that America's sudden eagerness to reach the moon during the 60's space race was the result of a mysterious craft's crash landing. The first men to walk on the moon discovered a Cybertronian secret that would remain buried for decades. In present day, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are angered to discover that the humans have been keeping this secret from them and demand access to the craft and it's contents. We discover that the craft is the Ark, a ship sent from Cybertron during the war containing a secret to ensure the continuing survival of the Cybertronian race.For starters, I should mention that the story in this movie is actually coherent. It's amazing how much better things turn out when your writers aren't on strike. The plot is pretty slim (though I love the premise: integrating man's first landing on the moon with the Transformers canon), but that's to be expected in a movie where the big interest is the visuals. If there's one thing that can be counted on in a Transformers movie, it's that the CG will be spectacular. They've had three movies to perfect these effects, so yeah, they're pretty awesome. Quick complaint about the CG: the computer-generated JFK. It sucked and stuck out horribly. The Transformers themselves look great and the action is seamless and intense. The battles in this movie are done a lot better than in the previous movie because you can actually see what is going on. With that said, I've got to saythe fights in this movie are pretty brutal. I was surprised. I mean, the whole series is based on a collection of children's toys and a cartoon. When the Transformers fight in this movie, robots are being dismembered. 'Blood' is spurting. Death gurgles. Heads ripped off and even a 'spine' being ripped out. Seriously, you replace the robots with humans in this movie and you've got a hard-R rated action film. I'm not complaining, I'm justwow. A bit out of place but pretty cool nonetheless.There's a lot of action in this movie. The last 45 minutes in the movie is a non-stop action sequence as Sam and the Autobots infiltrate a Decepticon-devastated Chicago. But, unlike the overlong action ending in REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, this one entertains. The majority of the regular cast returns here: Shia LeBeouf, Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, etc. Even Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) get some screen time, though mercifully less than in the second movie. The only one missing is Megan Fox. Oh well. Her character was nothing more than eye candy in both of the first movies so, plot-wise, she won't be missed. Nope, director Michael Bay merely replaced her with a different piece of eye candy, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. A Victoria's Secret model, Rosie's acting history is limited. But that's OK, because the only thing this character needs to do in Michael Bay's Transformer movies is look good in slow motion and show off the goods when necessary. And that's all she does. Mission accomplished? Speaking of Michael Bay, I guess he's had a good run with the Transformers series but, in my opinion, it's time for him to let go. Let another director have a chance to bring these larger-than-life robots to the big screen. He's done well (ok, except for FALLEN) but his shtick is getting stale. His obsession with the military is becoming overbearing in these movies. I get it, he likes the armed forces and has some friends inside that let him use the cool stuff. But I didn't come to this movie to see Bay's military toys, I came to watch giant robots kick each other's butts. Enough, man. I also think the character of Sam Witwicky has run his course. Let him remain as a supporting character in future films, but pass the torch to a new leading man. New director, new characters, more robots. Time for an overhaul. Well, time will tell where this series will go in the future (and there's already a release date scheduled for a fourth film). On the bright side, DARK OF THE MOON was fun enough that I'm willing to see another in theaters. If you were a fan of the first movie, then DARK OF THE MOON probably won't disappoint you.",7,5,7,27 March 2012
The Social Network," Fincher Proves He Can Make a Great Movie About Anything, Including Facebook
","I had serious doubts when I heard there would be a movie based on the creation of popular social network Facebook. What could possibly be interesting enough to devote an entire film to a website where people routinely post pictures of their meals, play hundreds of crappy games, and stalk each other's every move? Well if there's one thing I should've learned by now, it's never doubt director David Fincher. Fincher's immense talent coupled with the sharp writing of Aaron Sorkin combine to bring us one of the best films of 2010. Based on the biography 'The Accidental Billionaires', the film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg, an antagonistic genius who finds inspiration in a drunken night of retaliatory hacking/blogging and a subsequent pitch from classmates for a new social networking website. He focuses his inspiration, along with funding from his best (and only, really) friend Eduardo Saverin, creates Facebook and watches it explode in popularity across the world. The story is framed within depositions for two lawsuits brought against Zuckerberg, one from Saverin and the other from his classmates that accuse Zuckerberg of stealing their idea.Fincher's movie is a slick, fast-paced story that immediately grabs your attention from the opening scene, with Zuckerberg's high speed rant to his girlfriend over final clubs and standing out in a college full of geniuses. Right away, we know from his dismissive attitude and his arrogance that Zuckerberg is not a good guy, and we see over the course of the next two hours how self-centered he really is. I'd thought Jesse Eisenberg was great in ZOMBIELAND and he proves he's more than just the 'new Michael Cera' with his excellence as Mark Zuckerberg. He helps turn Zuckerberg into a complex character; in the DVD commentary, Fincher notes that it wasn't meant to be the breakup with his girlfriend that drove him to create Facebook as a means of impressing her, showing her why she should be with him. But to me, that's exactly how the movie plays out: Zuckerberg is hurt when his girlfriend leaves him and everything he does for the rest of the film is merely an attempt to regain her attention and show her what he's become.THE SOCIAL NETWORK was my choice for Best Picture this past Oscar season and I was sad to see it lose. Along with TOY STORY 3, this was one of the top movies of 2010. It came as a major surprise and it blew me away. The cast was fantastic; even Justin Timberlake continues to prove he has strength as a legitimate actor (for further proof, see BLACK SNAKE MOAN). Andrew Garfield was great as Zuckerberg's former best friend, Eduardo Saverin, and I'll be curious to see how his career progresses after such a high profile film. Finally, we have Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross's award-winning score for the film: a sharp synthetic sound that feels at home in a Fincher film and gives it a familiar feel. This film is wonderful; how accurate it was to actual events, I couldn't tell you. As a story playing out on the big screen, I loved it. I'm sure there are people out there who won't have an interest in seeing a movie about the creation of a social networking website, but it's a lot more than that and I hope most people will give it a chance to surprise them, as it had me.",9,1,2,8 March 2011
Back to the Future," A Classic From My Childhood
","I really don't believe it's possible to not enjoy this movie. It doesn't matter who you ask, I can nearly guarantee everyone has great memories of this film. It's a classic; most people would agree. The story is well-known but for the 1% of you who may not be familiar: Marty McFly is an average teenager living in 1985 until his friend Doc Emmett Brown invents a DeLorean time machine. When problems arise, Marty finds himself trapped in 1955 and he realizes that his actions may have prevented his own existence unless he can correct his mistakes. By now, everyone knows the deal: the car, the characters, and the countless memorable moments.I can't get enough of that DeLorean. It will forever be my favorite film car. Despite having been released in 1985, the effects in this film hold up surprising well. Every time I watch the DeLorean sparking up as it leaving through time, it's like watching it for the very first time. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are two of the most fun characters in cinema history in the form of Marty and Doc. They're perfect; I honestly can't imagine anyone else having been cast in those roles. Honestly, that extends to the supporting cast as well...Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Tom Wilson. I'll always love Glover's performance as Marty's father George and its a shame he didn't return for the sequel.Everyone's got a favorite moment from this film, as it's loaded with fantastic scenes. Mine would have to be Marty's initial reaction to finding himself in 1955 and his guitar performance of 'Johnny B. Goode' at the dance. Seriously, there isn't much a person can say about this film as just about everyone's seen it and knows how fun it is. It was the start of one of the most entertaining film trilogies and it's a worldwide phenomenon.",8,0,0,19 March 2010
Jurassic Park," I LOVE this movie!
","This film is easily one of my favorite movies. I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 1993; I was only 9-years-old and, though some scenes scared the crap out of me, it blew me away. I was amazed at how, for the first time in a movie, I felt like I was watching REAL dinosaurs. For those who haven't seen this movie (there are people like that?), it centers on a billionaire's attempt to create a new amusement park on an isolated island creating bio-engineered dinosaurs; when a group of specialists are brought in to examine the park, things go terribly wrong.I absolutely loved the story of this film; I loved it so much I had my parents buy me Michael Crichton's novel and I read it 3 times through the course of my fifth grade year. It was then that I fell in love with the work of Crichton and found myself reading the rest of his work. While, yes, the movie did divert pretty heavily from the book, I still felt it was a great adaptation. It's Spielberg's version of Crichton's story, so I don't mind the mass differences. The movie is much more family-friendly than Crichton's novel and I would love to see a another version eventually, a darker version that sticks closer to Crichton's novel. Unlike most instances when I can say 'The book was better' or 'The movie was better', I don't feel the need in this case because they were both fantastic.The cast did a terrific job. Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Richard Attenborough...all were great in their roles. Though my favorite performance came from Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm, the arrogant chaos theoretician. I've been a fan of Goldblum for a while and I thought he was the perfect choice for the role in this movie. Of course, I have to rave a bit about the film's special effects. As I mentioned before, this film contains probably the most realistic dinosaurs seen in cinema. A seamless combination of practical animatronics and CGI were used to bring the dinosaurs to life. By now, the effects seem a little dated but they continue to stand strong even now, 15 years later.This movie is one of those films that every must see. It grossed $350 million in the US alone. The film marked yet another milestone in special effects in cinema. And most importantly, it's just entertaining.",10,17,24,2 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," Good for Fans of the Series, but Needed More Springfield
","I have been a fan of the Simpsons for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I'd fight for the chance to stay up on Sunday nights to watch the latest episode and I caught up later when I found it on syndication. There was a time when I was sure to watch every episode, usually multiple times. Not so much anymore. Some time in the last ten years, I just started losing interest. By the time THE SIMPSONS MOVIE came out in 2007, I'd all but stopped watching the series but I was still there opening night. The thought of catching the prime-time powerhouse animated family on the big screen was enough to grab my interest, and I suppose the result was about what I expected. It's about the same as watching an extra long episode of the series. The movie opens when Lisa Simpson begins a crusade to clean up the pollution and end the dumping in Lake Springfield; meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from a Krusty Burger commercial. These two seemingly separate plot lines collide when Homer ditches a silo full of pig crap in the lake, sending pollution levels through the roof and alerting the Environmental Protection Agency. The new head of the EPA, conniving businessman Russ Cargill (recurring Simpsons guest star Albert Brooks), convinces the President to isolate Springfield in a giant glass dome, angering the town residents and sending the Simpson family on the run as fugitives. Can the Simpsons save Springfield? Well, the show's still on the air, isn't it?When this movie came out in 2007, the television series had pretty much passed its prime. The newer episodes were good for a few laughs but, for the most part, the show had lost its spark. The movie was a few years too late and probably should've hit theaters sooner while the Simpsons were still a hot commodity. The show is one of the longest running in television history so I guess, as long as they've been pumping out episodes, it was only a matter of time before it ran out of steam. The movie feels like nothing more than a ninety- minute episode of the show, so I guess that's a good thing. I don't really see how a Simpsons movie can be all that cinematic but the colors are sharp and the animation looks wonderful. The movie is actually really funny for the first half hour or so but loses a lot of momentum when the Simpsons leave Springfield. Fans of the show will generally agree that the town of Springfield is just as much a character in the series as anyone. So when the family hightails it out of there and lands in Alaska, it's not as fun. The entire middle of the movie drags when the family goes through its fugitive stage and tries to make a new life. It doesn't pick back up again until the final act when they return to Springfield to make their stand.The movie's still pretty funny, even at it's weakest moments. It plays a lot off the current obsession with environmentalism and going green, going so far as to satirize the government a bit with it's tendency to overreact in some situations. There are also a lot of nods to fans of the show; for example, there's a point later in the movie where we briefly visit Springfield Gorge and find the crashed ambulance from the second season episode 'Bart the Daredevil'. It's little things that like that made me smile while watching the movie in the theater. Everyone's favorite character will get a moment in the spotlight here with all of Springfield's citizens getting their moment, whether it be Comic Book Guy celebrating a life well spent or Otto getting high while the world crumbles around him. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE does a great job of catering to the fans and giving us what we want (Itchy and Scratchy on the big screen!) but it never really rises above the novelty of a feature length Simpsons movie. I don't know, I suppose I just wish a) the movie had been kept confined within the town of Springfield and utilized the supporting characters more and b) the movie felt a little more epic. The series has some fantastic writers on staff and I wish the movie had hit a little harder (and a little earlier). Overall, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is a fun time but, just as with the later seasons of the show, isn't as good as the classic early episodes.",8,0,1,20 November 2012
The Martian," A Fun, Hopeful Piece of Sci-Fi (with Emphasis on the 'Sci')
","I would describe Ridley Scott's THE MARTIAN as 'infectiously hopeful'. Astronaut Matt Watney, played with irresistible charm by Matt Damon, rarely succumbs to the near hopelessness of his situation. I think he only ever loses his composure twice in entire movie. It's hard not to smile along with him, cheering him on as he proceeds to outsmart the red planet at every turn. Damon finds support in an all-star cast in this bright bit of science fiction, including Jeff Daniels, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jessica Chastain, and more. As you've probably figured out, Damon's Watney is the titular MARTIAN. He is stranded when the Mars mission of which he's a member is forced to abort their expedition and evacuate in the face of an enormous wind storm barreling down on them. Believing him dead as a result of some flying debris, his team launches for home and Watney awakens later, injured and alone. He's a little bummed at first but, almost immediately, he becomes determined to 'science the sh*t' out his situation and survive until the arrival of the next Mars mission. To accomplish this, he will need to overcome his limited food supply and the overwhelming odds stacked against him on a planet unsuitable for human life. Meanwhile, those in charge at NASA become aware of Watney's unexpected survival and immediately start crunching the numbers in hopes of determining the fastest, safest means of bringing him home. It's a race against time and Watney will have to use every ounce of his ingenuity if he's to succeed.It's always a nice treat when Hollywood gifts us with some real science fiction. So many 'sci-fi' movies anymore have to deal with alien invasions, epic space battles, or fantastical pseudoscience. THE MARTIAN, based on the novel by Andy Weir, makes an effort to be as grounded in reality as possible. Granted, this is still a big budget Hollywood film and there are time and story constraints that won't let it embrace the full extent of the science behind the action but it goes above and beyond most other films of this nature. Seeing as how Watney is alone on Mars, the filmmakers used a series of video journals that Watney keeps for the duration of his stay as a means of delivering a lot of the exposition and the explanations behind what he's trying to accomplish, whether it be establishing communication with Earth or growing potatoes in a blend of Martian soil and human waste. It also gives Damon, as an actor, someone to talk to, even if it's to the imagined future viewer of his video logs. Damon spends the vast majority of his screen time alone in this movie and it's a credit to his charisma and, again, optimistic nature that he pulls it off so well. Throughout the movie, we intercut between Damon with his latest problem and the NASA staff putting together their own plan to save him before his food supplies run out, with Jeff Daniels' NASA director Teddy Sanders given the rough task of preparing a rescue operation under the watchful eye of the public.Sanders and his team have a massive endeavor ahead of them, but at least he's got a great crew of minds behind him. Ejiofor is Vincent Kapoor, seemingly the team's voice of reason and the driving force behind the think tank. Kristen Wigg has a minor role as NASA's public relations officer, and Sean Bean is the mission commander who insists on informing Watney's fellow crewmembers (who are currently en route home to Earth) that he survived. That crew, by the way, consists of Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Sebastian Stan, and Kate Mara. I wasn't kidding about the cast; this movie is packed to the brim with talent. Ridley Scott has created his most entertaining movie in years with THE MARTIAN. It's got everything I love: talented cast and crew, an engaging plot, and the aforementioned sci-fi with an emphasis on the science. If I had one problem with the movie (and unfortunately I do) it's the final act where everything I enjoyed about the movie is set aside for a more traditional thrill-ride climax. It was also the only moment in the film where I wish Damon's character would show a little more fear and uncertainty. The plan to get him off Mars in insane (but just insane enough to work, I suppose) and his continued quipping at that point felt inappropriate. But a stumble at the finish line isn't enough to ruin the fun everything that preceded it. As much as THE MARTIAN is great sci-fi, it's also a real good time and that's what's important.",8,3,6,12 October 2016
Evil Dead II," The Ultimate Cult Classic!
","For whatever reason, I've been on a horror kick for the past few months, which is odd because it's a genre for which I've never had much love. I've seen some good and some bad but it all made me want to go back to one of my favorites. A movie I had seen in over a decade: EVIL DEAD II. There is so much awesome in this movie and I'm pretty sure anyone reading my comments on here has already seen this movie so I'll probably just use this space to share my love for it. In an age where the new horror movies flooding theaters on a yearly basis are near carbon copies of each other, following the same formulas and hitting the same notes, just remember we'll always have Sam Raimi's cult classic to fall back on. The argument could be made that EVIL DEAD II is more comedy than horror, but any movie that features supernatural tree rape and loads of chainsaw violence are going to have a foot in the genre. The movie is essentially the same premise as the original: Ash Williams brings his girlfriend to a remote cabin in the woods for some romance but finds a tape recorder containing readings from the Necronomiconthe Book of the Dead. As the words are spoken aloud, an ancient evil awakens and terrorizes Ash, driving him to the point of insanity. But hope is not lost as he is soon joined by a handful of visitors, one of which might be able to decipher the texts and find a means of sending the evil back when to the depths of Hell.Where do I begin? I love pretty much everything about this movie. It is the ultimate low budget movie that proudly displays the love of the craft from everyone involved. The cast and crew endured less than favorable shooting conditions and minimal resources but their desire to create a memorable piece of horror/comedy fun drove them through it all to create the epic-ness that is EVIL DEAD II. Sam Raimi and crew have an obvious goal of pushing the envelope of taste to the very edge without going over to the point that their movie never would've seen the light of day. When you think about it, the violence in EVIL DEAD II is pretty brutal. Decapitations, stabbings, dismemberment, blood and ooze everywherebut it's all done with this screwball tone that makes it less cringe-inducing and more laughable. When a character is dragged to their death through a basement trap door, it's accompanied by gallons and gallons and gallons (and gallons) of blood pumped from below in tidal wave proportions. Ash cutting off his demon-possessed hand is preceded by a Three Stooges-inspired fight between Bruce Campbell and himself in the kitchen. While the movie is still totally inappropriate for kids for the content, there isn't a whole lot you could consider 'scary' about this horror classic. Even if you the humor injected through the film's total absurdity isn't enough to keep you laughing instead of screaming, the film's minuscule budget ensures that nothing here will be sending you screaming from the room.I love, love, love the practical effects of this film. Raimi shoots for the moon with only enough budget to cross the county line, but he uses every conceivable trick to craft his film. Miniatures, matte paintings, and puppetry give this movie a perfect retro vibe. Creature effects are done with rubber suits and make-up, and camera tricks are used to perfect cheesy effect. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell, the man who became legend thanks to his role as Ash Williams, hero of the EVIL DEAD series. I honestly don't believe anyone but Campbell could've pulled off a character like Ash. Equal parts stone-cold hero and bumbling moron, Ash wages a one-man war against the Evil Dead. When the series was rebooted with EVIL DEAD in 2013, I enjoyed the movie but the one thing it could never recreate would be this character (and I'm glad they didn't try). Campbell gets it. He and Raimi knew just what this character needed to be this time around and they absolutely nailed it.EVIL DEAD II is a movie that needs to be passed down through the generations, whether it be by friend of family. I was introduced to the series by a friend when I was in high school; he had the movies on VHS and we binged on them in a single night to introduce them to me. When my daughter gets old enough, you can be sure I'll be sharing this movie with her. EVIL DEAD II is a classic. It's rare that director and his crew do so much with so little, especially in an age when most movies do the exact opposite. Keep the love for this movie alive and share it with future generations of fans.",10,3,4,23 May 2014
V for Vendetta," In My Opinion, It Should've Been a Trilogy...
","I loved this movie, but I love what it could've (and should've) been a lot more. James McTeigue directs the film version of Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel, one that easily ranks as one of my favorite graphic novels. In the film, young Evey is rescued by a mysterious stranger in a Guy Fawkes mask who goes by the name V. She is soon brought into his world as he exacts his revenge against those who've wronged him and plots against the totalitarian government reigning over England. This film was McTeigue's first run as director and he did a fantastic job with the heavy subject matter, high profile cast, and dense storyline of Moore/Lloyd's novel.I had not read the book before seeing this film in theaters, and I think that's why my love for it wasn't completely tainted. I was able to view the movie with a clean slate and enjoy it for what it was. After reading the novel, I can definitely understand why Alan Moore would've gotten so upset with its film adaptation. The film trimmed a lot of story and character development in an effort to fit it all into a two hour runtime, which is a shame. There was so much more to the story that I wish could've been included. In my opinion, the movie would've been better off being turned into a trilogy, in which each of the book's three chapters could've acted as a standalone film in one three-part saga, allowing for the full story to play out.Unfortunately that's not the case, but the movie was still great. A fan of the book couldn't have asked for better casting, with strong performances from Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, John Hurt, Stephen Rea, and Stephen Fry. The cast was each perfectly suited for their roles; you'd almost think the book was written with these actors in mind for each character. I noticed that the movie feels a lot longer than it actually is because of how much story is crammed into the two hours, but it never drags and it never becomes difficult to follow the dense plot. On top of that, the film has some great action scenes; I loved seeing V in action with his daggers. Forgiving the fact that the movie had a lot more potential that may never be realized in future cinema, McTeigue's film is a great action flick with strong messages behind it that I feel everyone should see at least once.",9,2,6,2 September 2008
