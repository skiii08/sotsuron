Hereditary," Almost perfect.
","Hereditary is riddled with anxiety from start to finish. The acting, writing, editing, cinematography, frame structure, and incredible score craft not only one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen, but also one that is simply gorgeous to look at.",9,1,3,18 April 2019
Captain Marvel," It's another generic Marvel movie
","The acting is poor, visual effects go back and forth between great and horrible, script is as generic and bland as it can possibly be. What saves this movie is the connections to the Marvel universe, goose the cat, and the skrulls were pretty good.",6,3,5,23 March 2019
Us," Better than Get Out?
","Although a more conventional horror movie then Get Out was, Us shines because of it's unique concept, amazing acting, especially by Lupita Nyongo, stunning directing by Peele, and how creepy and unsettling the atmosphere is at times.",9,5,10,23 March 2019
Aladdin," Not as good as the original.
","The live action Aladdin isn't as good as its original animated counterpart, but it didn't have to. While Will Smith is easily the best part of the whole movie, everyone else is serviceable. The cinematography ranges from beautiful to dull. The music also ranges from excellent to underwhelming. In the end, this Aladdin is good enough to please those who love the original, but not nearly enough to even compete with it.",7,0,1,11 June 2019
