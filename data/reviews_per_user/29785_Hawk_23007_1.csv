Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worthy Opening to a Space Epic!
","Having grown up a Star Wars fan, I waited with baited breath to see 'The Phantom Menace.'  After seeing the film multiple times, both in the theater and the DVD, I am still in awe of Lucas' masterful story line.  This movie is the first chapter of the Star Wars Saga and it is a fitting beginning. The plot twists, alliances are formed and schemes unfold in a simple trade dispute.  This film, perceived as boring by some, is nothing of the sort. There is action, political intrigue, great characterization, and humor. Highly recommended.",10,5,7,20 March 2002
