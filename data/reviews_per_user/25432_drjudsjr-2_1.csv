The Ring," a turkey in the vain of Blair Witch...
","the movie was about as scary as the wizard of Oz. interesting premise, however the execution was weak. The film starts out as an Urban legend kinda thing, that proves to be true. that part is the redeeming quality of the movie. the Investigation as to why it happens, and the How, is what bogs the movie down.Intersting, but not a movie to buy on DVD, rent it and then never watch it again.",Null,0,1,29 April 2003
