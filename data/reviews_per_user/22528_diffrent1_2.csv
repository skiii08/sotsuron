Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The best movie of 2011..
","OK first of all don't read any reviews about this movie before watching it because no review can do justice to this movie. This movie will really make you clap at the end. I'm a huge fan of Robert Downey Jr.'s acting so i was gonna watch this movie no matter what but the thing i loved the most about this movie was its direction and the editing. Each scene was perfectly choreographed, well scripted and captured. The sets and graphics were flawless and Guy Ritchie did an amazing job with the direction. Robert Downey Jr. was amazing as always and Jude law was very impressive. In a nutshell i found it to be the best movie of 2011 in all aspects.",10,0,3,27 December 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Brilliantly done.. action sequences are flawless..
","I loved the editing and the direction of this movie. The movie kept moving and didn't got boring at any point. Tom Cruise clearly shows wrinkles now but his acting is getting better with his age. It was nice to see Josh Holloway in the movie and Jeremy Renner is very good addition in the Hunt team, Did miss Michelle Monaghan though. The action sequences are done brilliantly, except 1 scene on the highway, they made me jump out of the seat at couple of points. All in All its a very good action movie. I wasn't expecting it to be this good after watching the first trailer of this movie but this franchise is definitely not over.",9,7,11,27 December 2011
