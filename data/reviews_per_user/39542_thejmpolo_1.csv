Casablanca," A nice recollection
","Casablanca is this type of movies that do not make anybody indifferent, of those that were remaining in your recollection forever. A precious history in times of war. A former romance that it remains in the hearts of those who cannot forget. The one who has not loved ever and to the time it could not have continued with the promises that once he said? Since this way it is Casablanca, which happened was the better of our life, but the time happens and everything ends.
' Always we will still have Paris ' says to him Rick (H. Bogart) to Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) this when it is going to divide towards America. A Paris that stays as this recollection that they have not forgotten throughout the years, a Paris that retains the love that was had and that there remained. Difficult what is ... truth? During the existence of the human this being it limits itself to promising things that in occasions it cannot fulfill, falls in love, looks for a reason by which to remain entertained until the sad end, that end that comes to all without differentiating any alive being of this planet, the death. ' Since the time happens ' he says the song that there touches Sam (D. Wilson) for Ilsa, it forms a of seeing that the facts of the present will transform in recollections of the future and when the death finally comes, it will be the recollection of us themselves what it will remain.
The presence on screen of H. Bogart is indisputable, becomes big in chamber and his action performs the better thing that transmits great classic this one, there is no way of resisting turn fascinated by his interpretation. His place is cozy and important in the plot. In fact, in this place it is where a scene takes place praises of great meaning. The German officials sing a military march and other clients of the bar remain quiet, listening until Lazslo (P. Henreid) sees what happens. It is admirable as VÃ­ctor, in this moment of supremacy Nazi, decides to intone the Of Marseilles one and the whole bar joins him, silencing to the German voices. An anthem for the freedom, the equality and the brotherhood.
Definitively, Casablanca is of the best movies that there offers us the wide range of the classic cinema and, since I have mentioned previously, it will remain always strictly between ourselves, will remain as what is, a nice recollection.",9,1,1,26 October 2018
