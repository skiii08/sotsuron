The Blair Witch Project," Absolutely terrifying
","I have intentionally waited to write my review for this movie.  I saw it shortly after its release and wanted to wait for the initial hysteria to die down.  I have now seen it twice at the theater and bought it on video Thursday.  This is truly the most terrifying experience I have ever had.The plotline (borrowing from the tagline here) is three student filmmakers disappear in the woods in Maryland, and a year later their footage is found. A young film student (Heather Donohue) hires two guys (Mike Williams and Josh Leonard) to accompany her into the woods near Burkittsville, Maryland to shoot a documentary on a local legend:  The Blair Witch.   The three soon find themselves lost in the woods, with no foreseeable way out, no matter where or how far they go.  All the while, an unseen force stalks their every move.This movie clearly plays on all our most primal fears.  Where am I?, How am I gonna get out of here?, and mostly..what the hell was that noise?  It teases your emotions and tweaks your nerves to the point that you feel relief when the credits roll.Heather Donohue is a major star in waiting.  Her 'portrayal' of a young woman paralyzed by fear (remember folks, they only had a rough outline of the script, everything that happened was as much a surprise to them as it was to us) is chillingMichael Williams and Josh Leonard are also wonderful in their 'roles'. Josh, in my opinion, is the most scared of the three.  He is the first to fall apart and shows his emotions easily.  Michael Williams is the one who tries, despite all odds, to keep the group together in an attempt to escape not only the woods, but whatever is hunting them.  These two young men have a wonderful acting career ahead of them, and it will be nice to watch them grow in the future.One novel thing about this movie is the fact that, in my opinion, it works better on the small screen than the big one.  The (mainly) videotape footage frames well on your TV, and somehow adds to the terror.  If you buy the tape or DVD, you can skip the 'newly discovered footage'.  It feels very tacked on, and is clearly shot on 35mm film.  Probably footage scripted and shot especially for the home release.Unlike modern horror films (Scream, Urban Legend),'The Blair Witch Project' packs a punch whether its your first viewing or your 10,000th.  This movie grabs you by the teeth and pulls you into the depths of its insanity.  As an old horror veteran, I have to rank this one among the greats, such as 'Psycho', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Halloween' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.4 out of 4",Null,0,1,25 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A wonderful 'start' to the series
","While 'Phantom Menace' has a few shortcomings (Jar Jar Binks being the prime example) overall this is a very well done film, and can proudly stand by the earlier three films in the series. Clearly this is a movie that sets up the next two chapters, and anyone who expected it to be any more than that was foolish.  The new cast of adventurers are well-crafted and believeable.  Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are strong presences and Natalie Portman as Queen Amidala (and her handmaiden Padme' Naberri) is a scene stealer.  Jake Lloyd does a good job as young Anakin, and the other supporting castmembers don't feel thrown together or weak.Effects wise, this movie is visually stunning.  George Lucas and ILM really pulled all the stops out as in 1999 there is nothing that cannot be realized.  Very few things look fake, and all sweeping shots are breathtaking.  Clearly effects were a lot of the budget of this film, and its a known fact that very few scenes were unaltered digitally.The character of Jar Jar Binks is either a love it or hate it thing, very few people will be on the fence regarding him.  I personally found him annoying at times, but other times appreciated his humor.  I couldn't help but think of a goofier Roger Rabbit.'Phantom Menace' has good character development, stunning visuals, and an outstanding cast.  For any fan or anyone just becoming acquainted with the series, this will not disappoint",Null,1,2,19 May 1999
Meet the Parents," A bit tedious in areas, but overall good fun
","Finally, a Jay Roach film I can tolerate!  'Meet The Parents' is a very funny, almost laugh a minute riot.  Storyline is pretty basic slapstick stuff, daughter brings boyfriend home to meet the parents, boyfriend finds himself in one bizarre predicament after another.  What makes this idea so good is the good performances delivered by the two main characters Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) and Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro). Greg is a well intentioned young man who makes an admirable living as a male nurse.  One day he decides to propose to his girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo). While in the midst of the proposal, Pam gets a call from her sister.....she has just gotten engaged and in the course of that call Greg finds out he is 'expected' to gain Jack's approval before proposing to Pam.  With sister's wedding day just a couple weeks off, they head to the Byrnes' residence to not only be at the blessed event, but to get dad's permission as well.Ben Stiller performs admirably in the role, handling every single crisis that comes along.  Greg is a too close to his 'Something About Mary' character than is comfortable, but it works well and Stiller makes the guy likeable.  Robert DeNiro is Jack Byrnes.  A CIA operative, Jack is a master at reading human emotion and can make a person nervous by a simple glance.  A decent enough character but a bit dry.  He loves Pam's cat though, treating him like a son rather than a household pet.  Teri Polo as Pam, Blythe Danner as Dina Byrnes (Pam's mother), Jon Abrahams ('Outside Providence')as Pam's druggy brother Denny are all good characters but don't add much to the story.Owen Wilson chimes in as Kevin Rawley, Pam's ex-fiance.  I have no idea why this character was there.  Nicely done by Owen, but the segments involving him are basically throw-away and inserted strictly to allow Greg to have another disaster.'Meet The Parents' is funny enough to carry what little dead-weight the script has (mainly Greg's disasters reach the point where you wonder what could possibly happen next).  If Jay Roach can smooth out the rough edges as mentioned above that have plagued all his movies, the next one could be pretty sharp.2 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,20 October 2000
Dawn of the Dead," Well, I've finally seen it..and...
","There are not words enough to control my fury right now. First, Gus Van Zant destroys 'Psycho' with his pathetic shot by shot remake, then Michael Bay and his troop of incompetent failures tred upon 'The Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. Now, now we have the writer of 'Scooby Doo', a commercial director who should have stayed in commercials, and a mostly forgettable cast raping the memory of yet another classic, perfect film, 'Dawn of the Dead'.I am probably the biggest Romero fan boy there is, yet I tried desperately to like this movie, I wanted to like this movie. I wanted to know that it's new concept and thoughts were closer to Tom Savini's 1990 remake of 'Night of the Living Dead' than to the pathetic, non-sensical mess this thing was. It took Romero's classic, stripped it of all its merits and concepts, and reduced it to nothing more than a moronic gore fest geared towards a moronic audience, loaded it up with mindless (and in some cases, nameless) characters, threw in music to rip your eardrums out by, and then ripped off one of the few horror gems in the past 5 years ('The Blair Witch Project') for it's ignorant conclusion.Plot line is that something unknown is causing the dead to return to life and attack the living. In the midst of this carnage, a small group of survivors gather and seek shelter in the closest local, the shopping mall. They include Michael (Jake Weber), Anna (Sarah Polley), Kenneth (Ving Rhames), Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and Luda (Inna Korobkina). After a run-in with mall security, they begin to settle in for what could be a long wait for help. After realizing it won't be coming, they begin to formulate a plan to get to safety.Acting? Wellpathetic would be entirely too kind a word, but I'm not sure I need to plant that blame at the feet of the actors. The leads all do well with what they have, but the problem is that the story is so vapid that it would be hard to recite with a straight face. Most of the characters were throw away, and we didn't even learn their names. For example, the very attractive wavy-haired blonde was apparently named Monica, and she was literally nothing more than filler. It took more than too much time to give us Lindy Booth's character name (Nicole), and up till that point, she was nothing more than pretty redhead background filler. Not that she's all that great anyway, as anyone who's seen 'Wrong Turn' realizes she's nothing more to a film than a pretty face.Characters were wooden and dull; there were only 3 worth caring about. Michael, Kenneth and Andy (Bruce Bohne), who owned the gun store across the street. Mall security guard CJ (Michael Kelly) redeems himself, and you eventually grow to like him, but the rest of the cast you don't care about, you wouldn't want to care about, and worst of all, you don't get time to care about.The only good thing out of this movie was the fact that its success (and rapid understandable drop-off) enabled George A. Romero to make his upcoming 'Land of the Dead'.Pathetic, brainless junk geared for a pathetic, brainless audience. Quit eating it up people, and Hollywood, get some original ideas. They're out there, I promise.0 out of 5, and I wish I could give it less than that.",Null,1,2,5 November 2004
Shaun of the Dead," Hollywood, pay attention to this film!!!!
","Because THIS is how it's done. As the world's first ever romantic comedy with zombies, 'Shaun' excels in every facet of its story. Want a decent enough romantic comedy, it's here (although the comedy outweighs the romance). Want graphic moments of zombie carnage? They're here. Plot line is simple enough, a down on his luck electronics salesman loses his girlfriend after blowing an important date, and after hearing the occasional snippet of news about a returning satellite, wakes up the next day to a zombie nightmare. He then snaps into action, going to rescue his mother (Barbara, played by Penelope Wilton) and Liz and takes them to the local pub. Coming along for the ride are Shaun's college roommate Ed (Nick Frost), who hasn't quite gotten out of the slacker mode, and Liz's roommates David and Dianne (Dylan Moran and Lucy Davis). Great British humor lines practically every frame of the film, the romantic aspect is there, but never tries to overwhelm the film, and when the film kicks in with the zombie aspect in the last third, it packs quite a horror wallop. Everything balances perfectly in the mix, and while the comedy does tend to be very prevalent, the references to its zombie (but don't say that word, Shaun doesn't like it) past is obvious. Many situations are closer to Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead' than the obvious 'Dawn of the Dead' reference in the title would have you think.Acting is top notch from Simon Pegg on down to the zombie extras. Nothings forced, nothing comes off as silly or corny, this is a perfectly crafted film. Best of all, this isn't even one of those homage type films where you have to look to catch the references, they just pop out at you in a groanless glory. Best film of the year, hands down. 5 out of 5",Null,1,3,26 October 2004
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Bigger, Longer, Uncut, and a little disappointing
","South Park the TV show is usually a witty little satire on modern life. Anything and everything is skewered by the team of Parker and Elliott. South Park the movie, appears to be trying the same format, making reference to the current situation regarding this post Columbine High world. However, it seems to fall into a rut....that rut being the 'we're no longer on TV so lets use the 'f' word a lot'.  And use it they do...from Terrence and Phillip's song about uncles (if you've seen it, you know how funny it is) all the way to the end, the 'f' word is loud and proud.  The plot basically concerns the efforts of Kyle's mother to ban Terrence and Phillip after the boys are caught using profanity after seeing the T&P movie.It all gets pretty crazy after that, with the US and Canada going to war over the arrested Terrence and Phillip and Kenny working his way through Hell after yet another death.If youre not a fan of SP, this movie will probably offend you greatly or just not make any sense.  If you are a fan, this movie will make you laugh senseless at times, and have you checking your watch at others.  Look for 'cameos' in the group of soldiers as they go marching through the city, everyone is there, up to and including Jesus as they defend South Park from the Canadians.Out of 5 stars, this is easily a 1 1/2",Null,0,1,30 June 1999
Spice World," Cheesy, Goofy, Silly, and lots of fun to watch
","The Spice Girls.......what can be said about them that hasn't already been said?  Well, for starters..none of them can act.  Playing themselves (albeit slightly exaggerated) seems to be a stretch.  The lone shining star as far as acting is Meat Loaf, who in his role as SpiceBus driver provides comedy release without being Jar-Jarish.  The fact he delivers the line 'hey I love these girls, and I'd do anything for them...but I won't do that...' without blushing is priceless.This movie has some of the cheesiest scenes in the history of film, with the aliens scene being among the worst, but when this movie hits with the goofiness, it hits well.  I still laugh to this day when I think of the plastic SpiceBus jumping over the plastic London Bridge.  Surprisingly, one of the best musical numbers is the cafe scene...where the girls show that they actually do have some discernible talent.This is the best summary of the movie I can give:  I hated the Spice Girls until I saw this movie, and now I have to say that I actually own a CD of theirs",Null,7,8,6 July 1999
The Mummy," Really funny comedy....oh wait...its a horror flick
","After hearing all the good stuff about 'The Mummy', I wanted to see it. Unfortunatly I missed it in the theater, and rented it tonight on video.  I have to say I laughed hysterically through a lot of it.  I dont think it was supposed to have been a comedy though.Brendan Frasier leads the cast as Rick O'Connell, an American who seems to be serving with the French Foreign Legion.  Frasier is well suited to the part, and shows surprisingly good comic timing with lots of deadpan deliveries of certain lines.Rachel Weisz is the female lead, a somewhat clumsy librarian with an extensive knowledge of Egyptian history.  She is as beautiful as she is dull, her character not very interesting.  She has a couple good moments, and also delivers some perfectly timed humor.Most of the rest of the supporting cast is just along for the ride, with Kevin J. O'Conner's Beni leading the way.  Youre actually happy to see this little weasel get what he deserves.Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep is not that great a character either, which is not what you expect from the central theme of the movie.  He is far more interesting and unsettling as a computer generated skeleton than as a real actor.  'The Mummy' is a great comedy, and I see why it worked well at the box office.  Maybe I'm growing too critical, but this one was just not all it was cracked up to be.  Also, it was about 30 minutes too long...it really needed less desert setup scenes.1 1/2 out of 4",Null,0,0,22 October 1999
X-Men," Great comic book to big screen translation
","Finally the blockbuster of the summer has arrived.  Want to take a action-packed thrill ride loaded with some of the best visual effects, terrific acting jobs and some of the best one-liner humor in recent films? If so, then you owe it to yourself to see 'X-Men'.  And soon.Plotline revolves around the plot of an evil mutant who is out to wage war against humanity, and his old friend and now arch rival, who believes that humans and mutants can co-exist.This is such a star studded cast that I'm going to tone down my usual critique of the actors to insure I cover everybody.  I'm going to start with Charles Xavior, better known as Professor X.  Smartly played by Patrick Stewart, the cult status this role will provide him may even eclipse that of Jean-Luc Picard, and with good reason.Halle Berry plays Ororo Munroe, who goes by the name of Storm.  Nicely played, nothing spectacular, but she fits in well and never detracts from the story.  James Marsden chimes in as Scott Summers, the man they call Cyclops.  Leader of the X-Men, this is also a well played role, if not a little thin.  Not a lot of meat in the script for any of the X-Men, but I'll explain that in a bit.Famke Janssen plays Dr. Jean Grey, a telepathic/telekinetic mutant who is Professor X's right hand.  She runs afowl of Senator Robert Kelly (maddeningly played by Bruce Davison), only to be searched out by him when needed.Tyler Mane plays Wolverine's nemesis, Sabretooth, Ray Park follows up Darth Maul with a kinetically furious turn as Toad.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gives a stellar turn as Mystique, a shape shifting mutant.  Not much in the way of dialog from her, but she plays smartly, and figures in the ending of this one.  Sir Ian McKellan plays the lead evil mutant Magneto.  Seeing his parents drug away in Nazi occupied Poland simply because they were Jewish is the impetus for his never wanting to be 'labeled' again.  He will control his own destiny.  If normals force registration and identification as mutants then he will.........Now, on to the real primary characters in this one....Hugh Jackman plays Logan.  We all know him better as Wolverine.  Living as a loner, unable to remember his past, Logan moves from town to town, engaging in local toughman contests to provide a living.  This is so well done that I simply have to thank John Woo and the entire 'M:I2' cast for hanging on to Dougray Scott. Jackman oozes Wolverine, and delivers the best characterization in the movie.  One day Logan runs across a stowaway in his truck, her name? Marie. Now calling herself Rogue, Marie has the ability to draw out the life force of any normal human.  Well played by Anna Pacquin, breathing new life into the voluptious southern belle.  I have to admit I didn't think she'd do well in the role, but she proved me and every other nay-sayer wrong.The special effects are top notch, the story is excellent.  Acting, not a flaw or bad word to say about the entire bunch.  Bryan Singer has done an outstanding job bringing this to the big screen.  You don't have to be a fan of the comic series to enjoy this movie, and if you are then the slight differences between the movie heroes and the drawn ones is inconsequential.'X-Men' is classic summer 'popcorn' fare, and should provide Fox Studios with just the franchise it needs.  Three cheers for a sequel and 4 1/2 stars for this film.4 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,16 July 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Magnificent filmmaking
","'Attack of the Clones' is a spellbinding return to the joys and thrills of the original trilogy.  George Lucas takes a less severe departure here than he did in 1999's 'The Phantom Menace'.Plotline is this:  While countless star systems are seceeding from the Federation, keeping the Jedi Knights busy mediating disputes, an unknown assailant is making attempts on the life of Senator Padme' Amidala.  This forces both Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and the Jedi Council to assign her protection.  Of course, this comes in the form of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the (still)lovestruck Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen).McGregor is much more in control of his character in this one, and while still making sure the overall feel is equal to Sir Alec Guiness' portrayal in the original trilogy, he begins to add enough of himself into the role to truly call Obi-Wan his character.  Good portrayal and the more he throws himself into it, the better.Hayden Christensen is somewhat dry throughout most of his delivery of the Jedi Padawan, but when he needs to call on his anger or rage, he does so well.  It's easy to get a feeling of dread when Anakin slips into arrogance or (more often) anger.  Not too bad a job, and perhaps in the next film we'll see more of that development as Anakin completes his turn to the dark side and into Darth Vader.Natalie Portman once again graces us with her talent, grace, and beauty in the role of (now) Senator Padme' Amidala.  Attempts have been made on her life, and the Senator is thrilled to see old friends Obi-Wan, Anakin, and R2-D2.  But she falls in love (somewhat unconvincingly I might add) with Anakin, returning his long held feelings.  Unknowingly, she does things in this film, that while having the best of intentions, only add to Anakin's journey to the dark side.  Natalie, thrilled to see you again.Samuel L. Jackson shows why he's one of my favorite actors, getting the chance to add some depth to the character of Mace Windu. Loved the purple lightsaber and he shows in battle (as do all the Jedi) that he is one bad dude.  Horror film icon Christopher Lee adds a very good and sophisticated Count Dooku to the mix, aiding Palpatine/Darth Sidious' (the wonderful Ian McDarmid) plan to bring the Republic down through a war.  Temeura Morrison introduces us to the Fett clan, as bounty hunter (and the blueprint for the Republic's clone army) Jango Fett.  Good role if not that meaty...look for Jango Fett stuff everywhere now.  Daniel Logan plays a clone as well...an unaltered clone of Jango named Boba.This movie is, without exception, visually stunning and the battle sequences (read that to mean not only battles featuring the clones, but some absolutely masterful lightsaber sequences) and in the final reel, this film picks up major steam and puts you (literally, judging from a quick scan of the audience) on the edge of your seat.  I'd go back for those sequences alone!  However, the movie's weak part is, in fact, the major part of the story....the romance between Anakin and Padme'.  Try as I might, I couldn't believe there was any kind of chemistry between them!  She seemed to want to keep some distance between them, and never really seemed to have the remotest amount of interest.  Still, it didnt detract too much from the film....as the romance seemed to play out whenever another, more significant event would occur.'Attack of the Clones' is a vast improvement over the slightly weaker 'Phantom' (you anti-Jar Jar folks will be happy he's hardly in this one). The ending is mouth watering, leading you to believe that 'Episode III' will be the ultimate chapter in the series, eclipsing even 'Empire' as THE must-see film in the series.5 out of 5",Null,0,1,16 May 2002
10 Things I Hate About You," As teen movies go, not too bad
","'10 Things I hate About You' starts off as your usual teen flick.  Somewhat devoid of any real enjoyment....the first 30 minutes is completely forgettable.  You get an immediate distaste for it, with the primary characters (Bianca, and her friend Chastity) being your stereotypical self absorbed teen queens.  Then you have your arrogant pretty boy, your anti-social sister (Kat) that ruins Bianca's very existence.  Your love struck new boy in school, the nerd assigned to show him around and the misunderstood romantic tough guy.Once you get through that though, the movie begins to take on a certain charm, as Kat begins to fall for Mr. tough guy, =who turns out to have a heart of gold.  Bianca's pretty boy turns out to be a self absorbed jerk, and she falls for nerdy new boy.Julia Stiles steals the movie, although I firmly believe this was designed as a Larisa Olyneck vehicle.  Her Kat is the only character to reach beyond the teen stereotypes the others fall victim too, and she simply steals each scene.  Her table dance is one of the most memorable in recent history, and reveals her character's 'soft' sideBeing a guitar player, I was quite pleased to see my favorite guitar (Fender Stratocaster) get some screen time.....way to go there!!!!
Anyway, '10 Things' is an enjoyable romp worth your 97 minutes. See it and stay for the credits, aside from a bad cover of Cheap Trick's 'I Want You to Want Me' by some lame 90's band, there are some very funny outtakes in the tradition of 'Grumpy Old Men ' or 'Cannonball Run'1 1/2 out of 4",Null,0,0,16 October 1999
Notting Hill," First of Julia's summer hits is a miss
","'Notting Hill' was probably intended to try to appease Julia Roberts hungry moviegoers until 'Runaway Bride' hit the screens. Too bad its not a very good movie.Plot is this:  a divorced unlucky at love bookstore owner meets a famous American actress and they share an instant mutual attraction.  It then follows their romance through his discovery of her boyfriend, then his roommates' deception of her 'hiding place' when nude photos of her are printed in the British tabloids, and finally his decision that he didn't want to see her again.Julia Roberts puts forth a less than stellar effort on this one. Her character (Anna Scott) isnt very well executed and she seems to be trying to save her best work for the superior 'Runaway Bride'.  She has some good moments and her charm shines through often enough that you won't be disappointed.Hugh Grant is lively as William Thacker, the owner of the small travel book store.   He has some pretty decent moments, and is not as dull as he has been in previous movies.  The supporting cast really shines though.  Ryhs Ifans is Spike, William's slightly less than hygenic roommate.  He is both offensive and hysterical all in the same scene.  The rest of the cast is solid and well done.  Very believable characters.'Notting Hill' was just good enough to hold over die hard Julia fans till 'Runaway' hit, but it was quite plain thats all this movie was meant to be. It was overlong, drawn out and at times a bit dull. Next time you wanna have multiple releases Julia, make sure you put your best effort into them both.2 out of 5",Null,0,0,9 November 1999
American Pie," A 'Porky's' for the 90's??
","'American Pie' starts off with a bang, and gets a bit shaky from there. This story of five friends who make a pact to lose their virginity by prom night is often hysterical, occasionally dull, but always interesting.Jason Biggs leads the cast as Jim, a young man who is growing increasingly frustrated with being a virgin, and goes to great lengths to lose it. Let's face it, this guy is forever going to be remembered for the hysterical pie scene, but has other embarassing moments as well, either always being walked in on by mom and/or dad or a beyond description funny internet snafu. Great job by this first timer, and I can't wait to see what he does next.Chris Klein ('Election') plays 'Oz' as he's called by his friends.....this mr. popular lacross player is probably the most interesting character in the film, with an absolutely adorable characterization.  His attempts to woo choir girl Heather (Mena Suvari ('American Beauty') are so sweet and genuine that it adds a needed dose of humanity to this otherwise crude comedy.Since we're on the subject, Mena Suvari plays good girl Heather to the hilt. A stellar singer and somewhat distrusting of Oz at first, she eventually realizes there's more to the boy than first thought, and she falls for him. This young woman is gonna be around for a long time to come, and is gonna be a major player before long.The rest of the cast is good, Tara Reid ('Urban Legend') gets a better character here, and does a good job, Shannon Elizabeth as the sexy exchange student Nadia, Eddie Kay Thomas as the nerdy Finch, Seann William Scott as the rude jock Stifler.  All good characterizations and believeable as people you went to or go to school with. Alyson Hannigan (TV's 'Buffy') was easily the biggest surprise for me, the nerdy character (much like Willow) suddenly gives way with THE line in the movie.....towards the end, pay special attention!!!Two others stood out to me.....Eugene Levy as Jim's dad, hysterical as he tries to reach out to his son concerning sex.  He is a scene stealer and was easily the highlight of the film.The other was Natasha Lyonne ('Slums of Beverly Hills', 'Detroit Rock City') As good an actress as she is, she was woefully underused in this one.  She rarely is on screen, and is giving advice to the others in short spurts when she is.  Ms. Lyonne deserved better than that, and that is my only gripe.'American Pie' is a good coming-of-age movie for the 90's, but is often very off color and crude.  If you're easily offended, try to either avoid this one or watch it in sections.  If you want a funny teen sex farce, and don't mind the crudeness, this one is for you!3 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,2 January 2000
Armageddon," Armageddon; thrill ride of the summer
","WOW!  What a fun movie.  Critics hate it, audiences love it...Does this special effects driven movie have holes?  Yes it does Is some of the script weak?  Yes   Are we asked to stretch our imagination at points?  Yes....But did you have fun when you left the theater?  The answer remains yes.....This is how movies outta be, fun. Sure the story is weak in spots, and some of the situations unbelievable (landing on an asteroid, come on!) but its FUN.  People have forgotten how fun movies can be, critics are looking for some big message in them, nitpickers love to whine.  This was the only movie of the summer of '98 to live up to its pre-determined blockbuster status, and it did.  Bruce Willis turns in a wonderful performance as Harry Stamper.  Ben Affleck is believable as LivTyler's love interest.  The SFX are wonderful and Steve Buscemi is a scene-stealer..Give it a rest critics and nitpickers....you should enjoy yourself in a movie...thats why its called 'Entertaiment'",Null,1,1,20 October 1998
American Beauty," Scathing painful look at American dysfunctionality
","'American Beauty' is one of the few films that not only surpasses it's hype, but was truly deserving of the Best Picture Oscar bestowed upon it.This stunning look at a dysfunctional suburban upper middle class family is often painful, sometimes funny, occasionally perverse, but always biting and very well done.  Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as Lester Burnham, a man who is basically going through a mid-life crisis.  He quits his job, blackmails the supervisor into a staggeringly high severance package and begins to assert himself after years of bowing to his wife's wishes.  One evening while attending his daughter's dance team performance at a basketball game, he catches a glimpse of a friend and team member of his daughter's and immediately decides he has to have her.  This is simply the best performance Mr. Spacey has given to date, and considering the work he's done leading up to this, that's quite a comment.Annette Bening is Lester's wife Carolyn.  A real-estate agent with an inferiority complex about the competition, Mrs. Burnham reveals her admiration for this competition in a drunken stupor.  She asks him for advice and ends up with more than she may have intended to get.  Possessions matter a great deal to her, and her sex life with Lester is non-existant. Only a great performance from Annette could have been acceptable against Kevin and we certainly got it.  Carolyn is every demographically correct woman I have ever met.  The only word I have for this is perfect.Thora Birch plays Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's teenage daughter.  Lots of angst in this character as her parents and her have grown apart.  Little or no communication exist between the family members regardless of her pleas for such.  Jane ends up falling for the 'weird' kid next door, Ricky Fitts (an eerie Wes Bentley) and plans to run away with him.  Good role here, good enough for what was called for. Mena Suvari chimes in with her best role yet, the temptress Angela Hayes.  A girl who's bark is worse than her bite, Angela relies on her looks and sex appeal to get through life.  Mena brings Angela to life, and is very much the lolita who plays bigger than she is.Supporting cast is quite strong, with Chris Cooper and Allison Janney leading the way as Col. Frank and Barbara Fitts.  Peter Gallagher is Buddy Kane, Scott Bakula and Sam Robards play 'the Jims' Olmeyer and Berkely respectively.  This gay couple in the neighborhood is actually more lively than the Fitts' but don't figure as prominantly in the story as they do. 
Director Sam Mendes has created a true masterpiece.  Watch it several times to make sure you catch all the symbolism present in the movie, some as blatant as the rose petals surrounding Angela in Lester's fantasies, or as subtile as the red door on the Burnham's home.  A Best Picture that was as widely received by the public as it was critically acclaimed.5 out of 5",10,0,0,29 July 2000

","The first real blockbuster of the summer season has arrived, and with good reason.  'Spider-Man' is an excellently crafted, written, shot and acted film.  With the exceptions of numerous continuity and factual errors (77 last I heard), some overly obvious CGI shots and the occasional line of very hokey dialog, this is a film well worth seeing.Plotline closely mirrors the early comic books premise.  Meek little teen nerd Peter Parker is bitten by a (in this case) genetically enhanced 'super-spider' and overnight finds he has the ability to climb walls, see clearly, and (in one of the funniest sequences)shoot webs from his wrists.Tobey Maguire excels in his dual role.  Maguire has not only the physical look (can't believe Freddie Prinze Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio were even considered) but the mannerisms to make both characters come to life.  Peter takes his newfound abilities lightly at first, but after failing to use them to stop the robbery of a promoter who failed to deliver on his end of the bargain does the reality and importance of what Peter is capable of hit home.  Willam Defoe is masterful as the deranged Green Goblin.  Also a dual role, Defoe brings an arrogant, dry styled Norman Osborn...but lights things up after a genetic experiment of his own brings out the dark side of his personality.  Green Goblin may rank up there with Nicholson's Joker as far as super villain performances to reference.  Kirsten Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane, the longtime object of Peter's quiet affections.  However, she doesn't seem to throw herself into the role as much as she has previous roles.  While I hate to say anything bad about Kirsten, as she is one of the few actresses who's name alone can get me into the theater, she clearly seemed underwhelmed by this opportunity.  Perhaps overlapping this with 'Cat's Meow' tired her out?  Not a bad performance by any means, but not up to her usual standards.As far as supporting cast goes, Cliff Robertson was admirable as Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was a delightful Aunt May.  J.K. Simmons was a bit overly grating as J. Jonah Jameson, but that's how he was in the comics as well.  Everyone else was basically background clutter, especially James Franco's Harry Osborn.  Perhaps when he returns as Green Goblin #2 he'll act more alive...we'll see.'Spider-Man' is a wonderful two hours.  Director Sam Raimi delivers his best work since the original 'The Evil Dead' and clearly this was a labor of love for him.  Great film, and it opened huge, but with 'Attack of the Clones' following close behind, this one may not quite have the staying power Marvel/Sony hopes for.3 3/4 out of 5",Null,0,0,12 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Let the summer season begin
","'Pearl Harbor' launches off the summer season promising some of the most spectacular battle footage on film.  While that is correct, the movie itself is brought down a couple notches by the story and it's rather lengthy method of unfolding.  At just a hair over three hours, 'Pearl Harbor' doesn't pass like 'Saving Private Ryan' did, but rather tends to take a bit too long explaining itself.Storyline consists of the friendship of two young men, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett).  Growing up together in a small town in (I believe it was) Kansas, the boys have nothing to do but look forward to one day flying for the US Army Air Corps.  One day an event occurs that leads Rafe into his role as Danny's protector.  This continues as the boys grow up and join the AAC.  Rafe volunteers for a dangerous mission in the 'Eagle' Squadron, a group of American pilots assisting the beleagured Royal Air Force during the Battle of Britian.  Before leaving though, Rafe meets a young Navy nurse,  Evelyn Johnson (smartly played by Kate Beckinsale). Evelyn is not only smart and classy, but exceptionally beautiful.  Rafe and Evelyn fall in love and she promises she'll wait for him to come back from Britian.  Without divulging too much more of that plotline, things don't quite work out as planned and tension exists between the two friends that finally erupts on Dec. 6, 1941.  The next day's events are absolutely mesmorizing.  Bruckheimer and Bay are at their best when things are exploding and guns are firing.  The entire Pearl Harbor attack and the subsequent Doolittle raid (which, ironically, is exactly what it did.....little) are the high points of the film. Unfortunately, they only entail about an hour of this three hour epic.  A lot of the setup story could have unraveled faster and perhaps shortened the running time. Not too much can be said about the supporting cast, as they primarly only supported.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is underused in this one, but plays his role well and never detracts from the story.  The other Navy nurses existed only as background clutter, although Betty (James King) adds a bit to the humanity factor of the attack itself.  Jon Voight makes an outstanding, if not a bit dry, FDR.  Totally believable.'Pearl Harbor' is not a bad movie, but neither is it an outstanding movie. The three hour running time is a bit indulgent, as most of the primary love story could have been shorter, the Doolittle raid left out altogether, and perhaps a bit more emphasis placed on Pearl Harbor itself.  Historical inaccuracies abound in this one: Japanese carriers didnt have superstructures on the deck!!, the attack took place at 7:55 AM, yet kids are playing organized baseball games???Still, 'Pearl Harbor' is worth a viewing.  3 out of 5",Null,0,0,27 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Simply the best
","I have read many of the reviews for this movie, as well as listened to my friends at work review this one.  First off, I'd like to say that all of you who complained about how this movie dragged in the middle have never been a soldier.  Five hours of boredom are suddenly followed by 5 minutes of unrelenting terror.  That is precisely what this movie conveyed.Mr. Spielberg has done a masterful job putting you into this infantry unit. The combat scenes are grittily realistic, and not the least bit overly graphic.  Got news for you folks, that's war.Everything is realistic and accurate, Dale Dye deserves a major bit of recognition for this.  Tom Hanks and his bunch looked like an group who had seen their fair share of battle.  Mr. Dye worked his magic to the same level on 'Platoon'.If you truly want to see an accurate depiction of what real war is like, this is the only film to see.

28 Days Later...," Brilliant Haunting Apocalyptic Vision
","'28 Days Later', while not (as the ads read) scary as hell, is without question one of the most brutal films I have had the pleasure to sit through.Taking its stylish cues of using brutally horrific images and themes to illustrate situations in society from Romero's 'Dead' trilogy, that's as close to GAR as director Danny Boyle gets.Plotline concerns a group of primates in an English testing facility being infected with 'rage'.  Whether this is an actual viral situation or simply the results of constant exposure to violent images is left (quite correctly) to our imaginations, when the animals are released by a group of animal rights activists, they attack their 'rescuers', releasing the horror on England.  28 Days after this event, a young bike messenger, Jim (brilliantly played by Cillian Murphy) awakens from an accident induced coma to find that nothing is close to the way he left it.  London, and all of England is empty.  Save for the infected and a few animals...nothing lives.  He eventually stumbles on a group of survivors (Naomie Harris and Noah Huntley) and after them a father and his daughter (the incomperable Brendan Gleeson and a wonderful Megan Burns).  They have discovered a looping radio signal from a group of soldiers in the north, and set off for safety.  Or is it?
All, of course, is not as it seems with the troops, and thus begins a final fight for survival.This look at how mankind reacts to events we seem unable to control is scathing and relentless.  In a frigid theater I was soaked in sweat by the time the end credits rolled.  Symbolism is everywhere, and I especially liked the use of the all white room on the ground floor of Jim's hospital representing the vast emptyness he will experience, and the black payphones showing the bleakness of trying to communicate.  Wonderful images, and those are simply my favorite examples.Supporting cast is astounding, in particular Christopher Eccleston as a manical Major Henry West.  I bought his bizarre behavior and completely loathed the character.  He really sold the part.'28 Days Later' deserves the hype and wonderful reviews it's been getting. This film will polarize those to see it.  You will love it or hate it, there is no inbetween.  This is also not a hollywood gorefest, it's entirely too intelligent a movie.Can you take what happens '28 Days Later'?4 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,20 July 2003
Coyote Ugly," Nothing ugly about it
","In spite of how it was marketed, 'Coyote Ugly' features a surprisingly deep storyline about a young woman from New Jersey, following her dreams of becoming a songwriter in New York.  Along the way, she finds work at a local bar--Coyote Ugly.  This experience not only gives her the confidence to work harder towards her goal, but allows her to conquer some of her demons.Piper Perabo stars as Violet, a girl from small town New Jersey.  Her mother was a songwriter and she inherited that gift from her.  She also inherited her mother's stagefright.  One night, she comes home and find her apartment ransacked.  Seeking refuge in a local diner, she overhears three women discussing their evening at work, and that one of them is leaving.  The owner tosses her a matchbook with the club's name on it, and this starts her on her road to her dreams.  Ms. Perabo makes Violet a character with depth, feeling and emotion.  Violet could easily be your sister, cousin..ect.  Far better job here than what she showed in 'Rocky and Bullwinkle'Maria Bello appears as club owner Lil.  Lil is a hardnosed city girl, despite her small town upbringing.  She runs the bar as if it is her life, and it is.  Tough, sexy and no-nonsense, Lil is a well written and brought to life character.  It would actually be a joy to work for someone such as her, as you always know where you stand.  Ms. Bello is always good at creating characters, her 'ER' work being another good example.Adam Garcia plays Kevin O'Donnell, Violet's love interest in the movie. Good Austrailian accent and a penchant for rare comic books are this characters selling points. He's got a great bit at the bar helping out Violet early on.  Good job Adam.I'm going to lightly touch on the other club employees for a sec.  Another relative newcomer, Isabella Miko plays Cammie.    A very very sexy woman with a severe shopping habit, Cammie immediately befriends Violet and helps her through the rough early times at the wild club.  Not a whole lot to the character, but she sells what she has.  Bridget Moynahan stars as Rachel, the club's enforcer.  A tough attitude and actions to match, she weilds her sexiness as almost a weapon and whatever you do, dont make her angry. Funny story about her and an anger management course.  I won't ruin it here, but its quite a chuckle.  Tyra Banks got a lot of heavy publicity for her role as Zoe, but it's more of a cameo.  Zoe leaves her job, and that's what enables Violet to work there.  Couple of nice dance numbers but that's about it for her.  She didn't detract from the film, however.John Goodman plays William Sanford, Violet's father.  A hardworking family first man, he is both proud and torn as his baby girl heads off into the world.  He eventually comes to Coyote Ugly and sees Violet dancing on the bar, water being poured over her.  Angry and ashamed of the newspaper pictures of his daughter, he is unable to tell her how he really feels. John Goodman is every man, every dad. Probably the best characterization in the movie.Overall, 'Coyote Ugly' packs a great story, killer soundtrack and well-thought out characters into a tight little hour and fifty minute movie and dares you not to like it.  It's hard to deny that this movie is fun for all audiences.  Don't let the gyrating trailers convince you otherwise.4 out of 5",Null,1,1,30 September 2000
Garden State," Well written, moving film
","Zach Braff's directorial and writing debut with 'Garden State' is an absolute masterstroke from a young man who, along with a talented supporting cast, has made 'Scrubs' the premiere sitcom on TV today. This heartwarming and beautifully made film starts off a little slowly, but once it hits its stride, it soars high.Mr. Braff stars as Andrew Largeman (Large to his friends), a struggling LA actor who's main claim to fame was starring as the 'retarded quarterback' in a TV movie. Working at a Vietnamese restaurant and long estranged from his parents, Andrew receives a phone call one morning that forces him to confront his demons. His mother has passed away. He must now return home to New Jersey to not only bury his mother, but his estrangement from his father as well. Mr. Braff's vulnerability makes this role work, his innocent charm enhances it, and his increasingly hopeful delivery of the material sells it.Natalie Portman (who was the first choice for the role, but Zach didn't think he could get her) graces us yet again with her timeless elegance, skill and beauty taking on the role of Sam. A once aspiring figure skater, her epilepsy and compulsive lying has led to a chance meeting and eventual romance with Andrew at a doctor's office. Such sweetness in this role, reminds me a lot of her 'Beautiful Girls' character, only older. Once again, Natalie gives us a magnificent performance from the best actress of her generation.Ian Holm plays Andrew's father, Gideon. Partially blaming Andrew for his wife's paralysis, Gideon has been trying to repair the 10 year rift between father and son. However, he has played Andrew's psychiatrist for so long, he seems to have forgotten how to talk to his son. Another well played, honest feeling role.Peter Sarsgaard plays Mark, one of Andrew's childhood friends, Jean Smart plays his mother, the only two characters to offer much more to the proceedings, and both add wonderfully to the film.'Garden State' is a brilliant film debut, it's well written and thoughtful story about growing up and dealing with the sometimes harsh realities of life never rings false, and after a slow beginning, picks up steam once Andrew returns home and realizes that life is far too short to live numb.4 ½ out of 5",Null,0,1,24 January 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Original opens the door for a good sequel
","And promptly runs right down the crapper. While the original 'Resident Evil' was average at best, it at least had a thought process and an organized story to tell. 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse' has none of those features. Director Alexander Witt hopefully has a backup career ready to go, because this movie's herky-jerky style and horrific cinematography would embarrass even a 1st grade class.Clearly, Witt and Paul WS Anderson loved '28 Days Later' as much as the rest of us, because this movie attempts to mimic the visual style of the British masterpiece, and falls flat on it's face. Plot line concerns the efforts of Alice (Milla Jovovich), Jill Valentine (the lovely and leggy Sienna Guillory), and a team of Umbrella Corporation commandos (led by Oded Fehr's Carlos Olivera) as they attempt to escape the zombie overrun Raccoon City, and rescue the daughter (Angie Ashford) of one of Umbrella's top scientists. Not too much to say about the acting in this oneother than its very poor at best. Milla Jovovich is game, and looks incredible, but is a pretty dull character. Same goes for Sienna Guillory's Jill Valentine. She's trying way too hard to be a badass, but looks incredible. Fehr's Olivera provides the ladies with some eye candy, but again, couldn't act his way out of a paper bag with a flashlight and a map.Direction was, again, horrible. The few interesting things that do happen in this movie happen so fast you can't tell or care what's happening. Lots and lots of rip-offs from far superior horror classics further mar this already terrible film. This is a bad movie that threatens a bad sequel. Fans were expecting 'Apocalypse' to surpass the original in terms of action, gore and story. Well, the action is thereSPOILER ALERT..culminating in a WWF style smackdown between Alice and Nemesis at the end.

Mission: Impossible II," A movie finally worth its predetermined blockbuster status.
","'Mission: Impossible 2' is one of the few movies that has the oomph to live up to its hype.  John Woo has created a visual spectacle, and the story is just passable enough to maintain interest.Plotline?  Fairly simple....Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called back into service after a rogue agent steals the antidote to a lethal new manmade virus.  With the antidote the villain (Dougray Scott) can attain the virus and wreak havoc on the population.I really want to praise John Woo, he has such a deft touch with action movies and the ones in this are no exception.  Fight scenes, chase scenes all so expertly choreographed that it seems like a ballet.  Top notch action sequences in this one that may only be rivaled this year by 'X-Men'.Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt,and is a engaging presence onscreen.  His chemistry with Thandie Newton (as Nyah, a very beautiful and clever thief) is top notch.  Wonderful characterization here, as Ethan never comes off too serious or too campy, but as a man trying to get the job done.Thandie Newton plays Nyah Nordolf-Hall, a civilian thief recruited by the IMF to help Hunt get to the villian (more on him later) because of a past connection.  I havent seen any of Ms. Newton's earlier work, but may have to go back and see them.  She comes off as a classic elegant beauty, but her character gets little more than the 'love interest' treatment.  She manages well though, and holds her own against Cruise.Dougray Scott as the rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose.  His deceptive and murderous ways have caused him to turn against those he used to defend and now he is in control of one of the most lethal viruses known to man.  And only he has the cure.  A very well played baddie by Scott, and he even steals a couple of scenes out from under Cruise.  First time I've seen him as well, but really cant wait to again.Supporting cast is little more than window dressing, although Ving Rhames (Luther Stickell) is more interesting than the rest.  Cracks a couple pretty good jokes too.'Mission: Impossible 2' is everything the first should have been, action packed, entertaining, and enjoyable.  John Woo may very well have saved this franchise for Paramount, and should pass tips on how to properly make an action film to the next 'Mission' director.4 out of 5",7,0,0,21 June 2000
Saw," Pushing the boundaries of horror
","But that's a bad thing. In society, there are certain lines you just don't cross. In some cases, ('South Park' comes to mind), barriers are crossed with humorous and usually well-intentioned results. 'Saw' has none of these though, and crosses some barriers with such a mean spirited savageness that I practically walked out.Cary Elwes leads the cast as Dr. Lawrence Gordon. Brilliant oncologist, but less than stellar family man, Dr. Gordon awakes one morning to find himself chained to a pipe in a horrifically disgusting bathroom with a young man named Adam (film's co-writer Leigh Whannell). Between the two men is a dead body, and from there begins the twisted game of a killer the police call Jigsaw. Once Lawrence and Adam figure out what's going on, the killer's previous exploits are told in flashback (and poorly done). The always reliable Danny Glover plays Detective David Tapp, whose obsession with catching Jigsaw leads him to be removed from the force after a breakdown following his partner's death (Ken Leung) at Jigsaw's hands.Monica Potter is good enough for what little screen time (not to mention dialogue) she gets as Alison Gordon (wife), Dina Meyer reappears briefly as Kerry, another officer investigating the crimes, and Makenzie Vega chips in as Diana, Lawrence's daughter.OKfirst off.an open note to all directors, especially those of you raised on that cultural void we call MTV. STOP THE JERKY CAMERA AND SPED UP FOOTAGE. Much like with 'Resident Evil: Apocalypse', the scenes of Jigsaw's victims are sped up and herky-jerky, making them practically unwatchable. This form of film-making was dead in 2000, quit beating this dead horse. This film is probably the most repulsive, vile, repugnant piece of trash I have sat through in my 33 years. In fact, this movie is lower on the 'lowest common denominator' scale than 'House of 1000 Corpses' was. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** Using a stethoscope to examine a child's heartbeat while a gun is held to her mother's head is appealing only to those of us in the community who should probably be under observation anyway. **OVER** There are films that are brutal and a test to watch ('Texas Chainsaw', '28 Days Later', etc) but when you walk out of them you don't feel like you've just been violated. Clearly director Wan and writer Whannell have a brilliant idea, with potential far eclipsing that of 'Seven', but instead allow (either by lack of writing skill or overabundance of depravity) themselves to basically do nothing more than test how much they can get away with just to see what that point will be.An outstanding concept that quickly descends into a sick example of excess. You two should be ashamed.0 out of 5 and I'm sorry for having plugged the potential of this movie the past few months.",Null,3,5,30 October 2004
Detroit Rock City," Expected a bit more from the Hottest Band in the World
","While I wasn't expecting 'Detroit Rock City' to be a masterpiece, I was expecting a little bit more of a good time from the band that really gives it's all for the fans...'Detroit Rock City' is a story set in 1978, when KISS was at the height of their popularity.  It focuses on the efforts of four friends to get into a KISS concert after one of their moms destroys the tickets originally purchased. Most of the comedy in this one is of a physical nature, although there are a few lines that are pretty good.  Edward Furlong returns in this one to play Hawk, leader of the group of friends, as well as lead singer for their rock band Mystery.  He plays a 'burnout' type character well, and is pretty funny during his efforts at striptease to win money for tickets.The rest of his friends are stereotypical with one exception: Sam Huntington as Jeremiah 'Jam' Bruce.  The band's drummer, he is shy and sensitive. Although constantly badgered by his nagging mother (a wonderfully over the top Lin Shaye), he manages to be not only rebellious enough to be your typical teen, he exhibits a heart and feeling missing from most teen characters.Once again, Natasha Lyonne is woefully underused.  Her character of Christine (KISS fans will realize that the two main teen females are named for songs:  Christine Sixteen, and the ubiuqitous Beth) is basically a disco loving tart, dressed in short skirts and acting as if she is better than you.  This, along with 'American Pie' really could have utilized this talented young actress better.  Speaking of Beth, Melanie Lynskey plays that character.  She is hopelessly in love with Jam, and due to a disturbance from his mother on her last day at Robert F. Kennedy High may be unable to tell him how she feels......or will she?.............. Ms. Lynskey does an admirable enough job with her part, Beth is the girl next door, the one everyone just loves.  She comes across as both shy and vunerable.  Good job.  Now on to KISS themselves. (SPOILER ALERT!!) They appear only in the final scenes of the movie to play the title song, albeit an abbreviated version. While they recreated a 70's era show, complete with set and costumes, that appears to be the only real effort put into this movie by them.  This movie is clearly focused on the fans and their loyalty to the band.  While it pains me to say this, as I count myself proudly among the ranks of the KISS Army, it didnt give enough of a thank you to the fans.'Detroit Rock City' is not meant to be taken seriously, nor is it Oscar material.  Its about having a good time and following your dreams, no matter what others try to do.  KISS are the unequaled masters of that realm, although this one will rank with 'KISS Meets The Phantom of The Park' in terms of cheesy.1 out of 5",Null,0,2,11 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The Saga Concludes
","And what a conclusion it is. 'Revenge of the Sith' is a brilliantly constructed film that very neatly ties up all the loose ends from the previous 5 chapters. While it begins almost comically, it takes on a decidedly sinister tone once Anakin's corruption to the dark side begins to take hold.Plot line is as follows. As the Clone Wars continue to rage, suspicion begins to fall on the Supreme Chancellor (as we all know it should). In response, Chancellor Palpatine (Darth Sidious.played masterfully by Ian McDarmid) begins his plan to subvert talented but troubled Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) to the realm of evil.Acting was superb; Hayden Christensen did a superb job, and was quite believable as the once chosen one who finds himself willingly twisted towards evil, for what he thinks are good intentions. Natalie Portman takes a minor role in this one, as Padme' really doesn't offer much to the storyline in terms of acting (although her character and its future do), but as always, she lights up the screen. Ewan McGregor continues the growth of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the style of Sir Alec Guiness. Ian McDarmid handles his dual role with skill and ease. In fact, there's nothing at all I can say bad about anyone in this film.Quite honestly, I failed to see where this movie deserved a PG-13 rating, as it's no more violent or intense than, say 'Attack of the Clones' and with a lack of profanity, I'm not sure I understand the MPAA's decision, but without questions, the battle scenes in this one rival those of the previous 5 films all put together. This chapter clearly was the down note in this series, as evil triumphs, but what a ride it gives you.5 out of 5",Null,2,6,19 May 2005
Bring It On," Lots of fun, despite itself.
","Aside from two very glaring errors, 'Bring It On' is a overall good look at cheerleading and the competitive aura that surrounds it.  A good cast and wonderful choreography really bring the story home.Kirsten Dunst lights up the screen as Torrence Shipman, recently promoted to captain of the Rancho Carne Toros cheerleading squad following the departure of 'Big Red' (an icy Lindsay Sloan).  Torrence is fully driven to repeat the successes and become the six time national cheerleading championship winner, but how far will she go to achieve that goal?  After adding a new girl (Eliza Dushku) to the squad, Torrence finds out firsthand exactly how far 'Big Red' went to assure her squad won.  Kirsten's own cheerleading experiences clearly helped in her making Torrence believable and fun to watch.  Ms. Dunst is one of my favorite actresses and she was clearly having fun with this role.Jesse Bradford and Eliza Dushku are Cliff and Missy Pantone respectively. They have just moved to San Diego from LA, and live life their own ways. At least until Missy finds out there isn't a gymnastics team and joins the cheer squad after one of the other girls breaks her leg during a practice session.  Jesse's character is mainly Torrence's love interest, and offers not much more than that (except for a funny electric guitar scene) but Eliza takes her role and runs with it, making Missy one of the better characters in the film.Gabrielle Union chimes in as Isis, leader of the East Compton High Clovers cheer squad.  She is understandably upset and aggrivated that while their school invents the cheers, Rancho Carne wins the competitions every year using their routines.  Gabrielle was also a cheerleader and it helps with her performance, and Isis ranks high on the reality charts and wins you over.The stereotypes are still here however, Claire Kramer and Nicole Bilderback as Courtney and Whitney respectivly.  Both snobby airheaded buffoons and Courtney has the added problem of being a bit trampy.
The errors?  Yes, I remember them.....first one.....Why is it no one CHEERS at the cheerleading competitions????  UCA rules specify that both a dance routine and a cheer routine be part of the performance, the writers and producers seem to have forgotten that.  Also, the film shows both co-ed and all girl squads in competition against each other.  There are separate divisions for each type of squad.'Bring It On' entertains in spite of some flaws, providing a fun watch and some really great outtakes and dance number at the end while Toni Basil's cheer anthem 'Mickey' plays.2 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,13 February 2001
Halloween," A pure classic
","This is one I've been meaning to comment on for awhile, but with all the new releases out there, I just havent had a chance. Let me start with this:  'Halloween' is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.The plot is simple enough.....15 years ago, young Michael Myers murdered his sister in cold blood on Halloween night.  Now he's back to complete his gruesome work.Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first starring role, plays Laurie Strode, a high school student unaware of her past (as are we all....it is revealed to us in 'Halloween 2' and expanded on in 4 and 'H20')  She is the intended victim of Michael's murderous plan.  She delivers a top notch performance and plays the strong willed survivor with great ease and skill.Most of the other roles are cliched, PJ Soles' trampy Linda, and Nancy Loomis' somewhat self-absorbed Annie.  The late Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis (Michaels psychiatrist, who is determined to never let him loose) delivers a solid acting job, and is belivable in his determination to stop the evil that has descended on the small town of Haddonfield.One of the best roles in the movie is surprisingly never mentioned.  Dick Warlock as 'the Shape', which is what adult Michael is referred to in the closing credits.  His methodical stalking and mechanical movements made the unstoppable Michael that much more terrifying.  Even his walk was scary, when he's pursuing Laurie across the street to the Doyle residence.This movie broke new ground in 1978, and was even honored in homage by Kevin Williamson (oh come on...'Scream' was almost entirely influenced by 'Halloween').  This is a horror and film classic, and retains its punch to this day, unlike the majority of horror films today (including the aforementioned 'Scream').5 out of 5",Null,0,1,13 September 1999
Shrek," A new fairy tale for a new generation.
","'Shrek' is all at once a beautiful fairy tale with all the trappings, a wonderful spoof of such fairytales, a hysterical comedy, and a wonderful display of modern CGI.This wonderful family oriented film features the voice talents of Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), Eddie Murphy (Donkey) and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad).  All bring their animated counterparts to life and make them all likeable characters in their own ways.  Eddie Murphy's Donkey clearly steals the movie however, providing comedy relief in a manner that shows not only how good the writing for this film was, but also that shows how much he has begun to grow as an actor.The story itself is basic fairytale type, the lonely ogre Shrek only wants to be left alone in his self-imposed exile in his quiet swamp.  One day Lord Farquaad issues an edict offering a reward for the capture of all 'imperfect' fairy tale creatures in his perfect land.  During the roundup, Donkey escapes and while running from soldiers is saved by Shrek.  After much haranging, Shrek allows him to stay at the swamp for the night and while eating dinner discover that Farquaad has dumped the ENTIRE population of fairy tale land in the swamp.  Determined to get his swamp back, Shrek heads off to see Farquaad and after an hysterical fight sequence, is made a deal:  Rescue Princess Fiona from the dragon, and get your swamp back. 
The adventures after that are exciting, funny, and sweet all at once. Princess Fiona is not even close to your average princess, and shows it in a sequence that is more 'Charlie's Angels' (that starred Diaz) than it is 'Matrix'.  She also holds a deep dark secret of her own....will she tell anyone?The only complaint I have about this film is the CGI characters.  While the backgrounds and buildings were beautifully rendered, the characters themselves looked a bit plastic.  In this day and age, and especially after 'Toy Story' and the upcoming 'Final Fantasy', the fleshtones could have been a bit softer and realistic.   That's really the only complaint I have with this film however.'Shrek' is a beautifully rendered and told fairytale.  There are jokes that kids will get, adults will get, and both will get (the classic Bugs Bunny cartoons, and todays 'Animaniacs' and 'Tiny Toon Adventures' use the same formula), making it an easy sell for all audiences.  Dreamworks has themselves their first real shot at a franchise with this one.

The Sixth Sense," The #1 Thriller of all time? Not quite, but a good watch
","'The Sixth Sense' is a schitzophrenic movie.  If you can make it through the first hour and 20 minutes of this one, it starts to pick up steam very very quickly.  The storyline consists of a psychologist's attempt to help a young boy with a terrifying problem.  He can see dead people.  These lost souls communicate with the boy on a constant basis, needing something.  Help? Revenge?  No one knows, until Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) enters the picture.  Dr. Crowe is fighting his own personal demons as a year before a patient with similiar symptoms to this boy reveals that Dr. Crowe failed to help him.Bruce Willis puts his all into the role of Dr. Crowe, and you can watch his face grow more and more haggard and emotional as he realizes he may not be able to help this boy, especially as his life at home begins to deteriorate due to his efforts.  This has emerged as one of Bruce's best roles in recent times and will stand as a true sign that he has matured as an actor.Haley Joel Osment stars as Cole, the young boy with the huge secret.  He is the real star of this movie, portraying the pain his character is suffering with an amazing dexterity and touch.  You feel this young man can really see ghosts, and react with his level of terror once we see them as well. The Academy went with longevity over the true best supporting actor this year, and I hope to see Haley Joel win the Oscar he richly deserves in the very near future.Toni Collette is the only other real character in the movie, playing Cole's mother.  She comes off a bit dry for a mother struggling to understand and find a cure for what ails her son, but overall is a strong character and feels real enough.There really is no supporting cast to speak of.  Malcolm's wife, Cole's teacher and the ghosts of the dead are the only real supporting characters in this one.  Filler mostly, although one dead soul has a bit more importance to the unfolding of the last half hour, and I wish I had caught her name.  'The Sixth Sense' was a sleeper hit, and I feel got as much overkill from media outlets as 'The Blair Witch Project' did, and like TBWP got a major boost in its audience from that.  Is it a good movie?  The answer is yes, the last half hour (and it's rather stunning final plot twist) is strong enough to carry the weight of the rather lengthy and droll first hour.  Is it a thriller?  To some extent, but packs nowhere near the 'thrill' of a 'Halloween' or 'Silence of The Lambs'.2 1/2 out of 5",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
The Truman Show," Over-hyped and overrated
","When 'The Truman Show' was originally relased, I was eagerly awaiting the chance to see it...I'm glad I missed it... I went into my recent rental viewing with the same attitude I go into all movies that generate a lot of hype, 'this sucks'.....well, I was right...Other than Jim Carrey's Truman, all of the other characters were wooden, and poorly acted.  Laura Linney's Merel was the worst offender, as was the Marlon, the best friend (I don't remember the actor's name,not will I even attempt to find it, as it would be a waste of time)The ending was possibly the worst I've seen to date, leaving you with a 'that's it?' feeling in the pit of your stomach....If you haven't seen it yet, let me save you the trouble. HE GETS OUT OF THE SHOW BY WALKING THROUGH A DOOR!!!!!!!!!I wasted 3.75 on a rental and an hour and 45 minutes on this, I know many of you will disagree with me, but this is simple fact.....The Truman Show should be cancelled",Null,1,2,12 January 1999
The Matrix," Exceptional Sci-Fi fare
","'The Matrix' is a stunning achievement in both the science fiction genre as well as visual effects.  The movie, visually, is simply without flaw.  The 'bullet time' photography, backgrounds, lighting, everything point to a great time of care and effort.  Character wise, the movie fares just about as well, although I found Lawrence Fishburn's Mephesto to be a bit overly dry.  Keanu Reeves returns from exile to star as Neo, a programmer by day and hacker at night.  He is suddenly drawn into a rebellion against the matrix, or what we know as the world.  Little does he know that he is the one of prophecy, the one who will set mankind free.Carrie-Anne Moss is wonderful in her role, its nice to see a strong female lead who is both sexy and strong at the same time.  Her character of Trinity is one of the strongest female role models currently on film.Lawrence Fishburn plays Mephesto, the head of the resistance movement and the one who finds Neo and brings him into the movement.  His acting is good, but his presence is a bit dry.  He acts a bit overly serious, like he is truly a messiah.  He doesnt detract from the movie at all, but I felt he tended to overplay the role a bit.Supporting cast: an A....all strong characters and central to the storyline. Tank in particular, as he was the controller of travel between the 'real world' and the matrix.You might notice I havent talked much about what the matrix is...lets face it, there are some of us out there who havent seen this yet, and its really difficult to explain...I dont feel like ruining the 'surprise' of the movie for anyone.  Suffice it to say that this review doesnt really exist..'The Matrix' is a spellbinding film...full of rich visuals and wonderful characters.  Do yourself a favor and see this one soon4 1/2 out of 5",8,0,0,18 November 1999
