Casablanca," cool
","Very long drove forward watch this the film. Simply regarded impossible for themselves not to familiarize themselves with such reinforced concrete classics. I was constantly faced with the mention somewhere of this film or quotes from it. In General, it happened. The beginning was delayed immediately and seemed promising, but somehow unexpectedly quickly came the final scene and the film ended. From the point of view of emotional coloring, the movie is very pleasant, there are moments for reflection in the aftertaste. In terms of expectations-Casablanca did not meet my expectations. The biggest disappointment is the lack of epicness, which was suspected thanks to the presence of three Oscars, universal gasps and comparisons with such a masterpiece of cinema as ' gone with the wind.'the film is interesting, with a 'tasty' game of actors. Dialogues me jobs indeed admired, sake of them can be even indulge, having revised picture still times, but in a whole the film leaves impression virtuoso theatrical setting. Ah there is no in offense scope, of course this not pulling on 3 Oscar, maximum on 1 nomination (what You will anywhere).

American History X," cool
","Reviewing the film from time to time, I always find it a wonderful example of street, state and family drama.
Amazing game Edward Norton does not break away from the screen and makes you feel a sense of presence among what is happening.The storyline... this is reality, as they call it. You seem to know everything and everyone that flashes and happens in this picture.The ending of the film makes you hold your breath, pushing you, as if into an abyss, with the reality of what happened. Everything in this film deserves the highest praise.The destruction of the family, the street and the state-all this permeated",10,1,1,9 November 2019
Psycho," cool
","Since the greatness of such a Director as Alfred Hitchcock can be said endlessly, then I, perhaps, focus my attention on acting. Psycho is definitely a Thriller with a capital letter. It is indisputable that it is quite difficult to judge the films that have passed through time, because of our impregnation with the culture of modern cinema. In addition, many Hitchcock classics may seem quite ordinary black and white picture. This happens to people whose eyes fundamentally do not perceive black and white classics. I must say that they lose a lot. Me same this the film hit immediately.In General, I tend to evaluate the film, first of all, from the point of view of acting. I would like to highlight Anthony Perkins ' performance. Let me remind you that his hero is a psychopathic killer who lives as a hermit, creating even more fear about his image. It is necessary to pay tribute that such an image of the main characters of horror films, in turn, is often used in modern horror, which, above all, speaks of the classics of this picture. To be honest, the game Perkins hooked me not childishly. So I watched, literally with my mouth open. This eye that draws you to the screen, monotonous and at the same time sharp movements that speak about his unstable psyche of his character and cause a contradictory first impression, the famous smile - all these details, observed by both Hitchcock and Perkins, deserve praise. And what the film's production and acting do together is difficult to describe in words. I am a fan of non-standard acting. Expressiveness and emotionality used by actors is alien to me. Most of all in the game I like realism, when purely individual qualities of the actor help him not to overplay, that is, to adhere to the Golden mean. Perkins, for the most part, manages to intrigue the viewer thanks to his incredible male charm.As for the work of Vera miles, the role of the weaker sex in A. Hitchcock is, first of all, the embodiment of femininity, which brings its unique charm to the picture, and therefore, speaking about her game it is difficult to find fault or comment on something. Women are an integral part of Hitchcock thrillers, and to me, her acting is no different from that of grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine. In his works, they act on a special pattern-either in danger or in the arms of a man. Thus, women in his films are an integral attribute, but not the basis.Speaking of the film as a whole-it is certainly a masterpiece. It's all so coherent, clear and while watching there is a strange feeling that you-not the only observer, for the most part, because of the use of unusual angles. And, of course, the saddest thing that makes me think about this kind of classic is that such films are one of a kind and some techniques in modern cinema are no longer used.",10,1,1,9 November 2019
Joker," cool
","It is impossible to characterize this film otherwise. This is a work of art, thought out in detail and filmed. The film can not be liked, does not cause a desire to revise it, but you admire it. Despite all the tragedy, all the pain that is contained in each frame, the film really admires. Although most of the reviews, both critics and viewers, are positive, there are fierce disputes about the film: someone does not like it decisively, someone sees in the film only the Joker, the villain opposing Batman. For me, this film is primarily about people, about the need to always treat everyone humanely. 'No one owes anyone anything,' I don't dispute that phrase, but even without doing anything good to a person, you can be kind to them the second your lives cross.'The Joker' is a one-man story, as frightening as it is realistic. Everything in this film is natural. By saying 'naturally' I don't condone the cruelties that the",10,3,5,9 November 2019
