The Avengers," Good, but why is Cobie Smulders in this?
","One of the best super hero movies I have seen, but it is only that. It isn't supposed to have any deeper meaning or advanced plot. This is a movie mainly for comic fans. I'm not much of a comic reader, but I still enjoyed it.There was a couple of things I couldn't quite ignore though. I thought the invasion was pretty terrible. The aliens sent in only a couple of worm things that contained a few alien CGI soldiers and bumped into a couple of buildings. It was not exactly an effective way to take earth. The second thing that kind of annoyed me was the aliens. Just to keep it PG-13, there is no gore, and the aliens are nothing but CGI bad guys.I was worried there wouldn't be enough screen time for each of the super heroes, considering there were so many, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that they all had their roles and input. What really annoyed me though, was Cobie Smulders. What an unnecessary character to throw into the movie! She did nothing of importance AT ALL! I don't know if Cobie's character is in the comics, but it's still just annoying to see her on screen. It's just a cheap business trick to have more stars in the movie and of course adding a fine movie to her resume. Every time she was on screen, it just reminded me that the film industry is just a business like everything else.I'd give it 8.0",Null,3,8,22 August 2012
The Cabin in the Woods," Original and surprising
","You want to know as little about this movie as possible before you see it, don't read if you haven't seen it.I'm not usually into horror movies, but considering all the positive reviews this move got, I had to see it. After the opening scene, everything was as I expected this movie to be, and I tried to figure out what characters would die first and what things would happen when they get to the cabin. Everything went mostly as expected, other than the whole monitoring part, until the twist, which for me is when Marty is seen alive. The first part was entertaining enough, and the second part very creative and original. I hate jump scares, and there was not so much of that. I was 99% sure Marty would kill the girl at the end, and it kind of bugged me that he didn't. This is still the best horror movie in many years.I was 99% sure Marty would kill the girl at the end, and it kind of bugged me that he didn't.",8,1,4,4 September 2012
