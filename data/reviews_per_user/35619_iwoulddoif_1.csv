Hereditary," This movie gives a most true impression of what the word horror really means.
","I like writing short reviews so here I go...The positive details of the movie greatly outnumbered the negatives.
The characters were annoying only to some point. Everybody knows the situations, where somebody in the movie that causes the audience to go like 'why the hell would he do that?' or 'what sense does that make?'. In this movie, I'm glad to inform the characters didn't do anything foolish during its entirety. Needless to say, that is pretty unique.During the movie, everything was eventually explained. If you focus on the details, you will uncover some very interesting things. Nothing really bothered me after the movie.The actors were mostly very good. There were some scenes, which weren't so well acted. In the end, however, I felt like some of the scenes that were simply put bad, weren't enough for me to dislike the movie.Great horror scenes, that would scare or frighten even the bravest of the audience. The movie had very few of the obvious 'jumpscares' that are usually so common. The scary scenes horrified rather than scared the viewers. They counted on the viewers ability to concentrate and detect stuff in the background. But don't get me wrong, they were great and there were very many of them.Usually in today's world, movies and series grow worse the more time you spend watching them (the two aren't in correlation with each other). There are just too many examples to even mention one. This movie, however, does the opposite. It goes from mediocre to very good.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of horror.",9,0,0,1 May 2020
