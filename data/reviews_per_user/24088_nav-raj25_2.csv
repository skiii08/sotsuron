The Equalizer," Must Watch
","Last year when i saw movie 'flight', i thought its best ever movie by Denzel. As i watched 'The Equalizer' i realized that there is nothing the best for a great actor like Denzel. Every flick is great in its own way. Character Robert McCall is a mysterious person and talks with eyes. His acting shows how mature he is as actor, its something that's earned over years. 'Marton Csokas' played brilliant role and he too is a mysterious character. Actual plot as i think is that lead character 'Robert McCall' is actually fighting with himself, He saw his helplessness in that girl, so he was actually fighting for himself to be out of his not so good past. Lead actors carried films so well that crowd will not think of logical things like how's and why's. Its a must watch in Theater, and i am sure the whole team of 'The Equalizer' will keep coming with excellent stuff like this one.",10,0,3,13 January 2015
The Shawshank Redemption," Shawshanks Redemption - Once in a civilization
","This movie is the Masterpiece and a benchmark in every aspect of film making. I feel that movie of this level is not possible to make in this civilization again. I postponed watching this movie for almost one year thinking it being a prison based movie, how WRONG i was cannot be explained in words. I actually saw this movie by pausing and listening again and again. Direction screenplay cinematography & acting all are molded, seems as if god himself gave a hand into it and result is THE BEST CREATION ever in film making. As movie finished for the first time i saw all cast and names of everyone who made this masterpiece. This movie is a must must watch if you are least lover of movies.",10,0,0,14 March 2014
