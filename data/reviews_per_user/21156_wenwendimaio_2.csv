Requiem for a Dream," Absolutely devastating!!!
",This movie sure teaches everyone a lesson or two about life and how quickly it can change. This is a powerful film that will leave scars on all you Drug Addicts. There are movies you want to skip if you are a non-violent and this is definitely one of them.,10,0,1,26 March 2003
Fight Club," Mind Blowing...
","Who says movies are just for entertainment? Well, whoever said it has been proven wrong by this movie. I'm prepared to say this is the best and most meaningful movie ever made. Only if the academy judges had human minds and not give titanic 11 oscars and this none!!! This was mind blowing, i admire David Fincher for going out there and putting forward what he believed in. Every other psychological thriller deserves to be put into the garbage compared to this, this has meanings to it and no other movies do to the same extent! After years of mediocrity and cliches, millions of sequels and brainless crap, there has finally been something worth taking your hat off to. I give this 15/10, best movie ever!!!",Null,0,1,24 December 2003
