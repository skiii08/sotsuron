It," Don't fall for the hype this is boring and awful
","I'm sorry , I'm a huge Stephen King fan and read his books all the time. The original IT from the 90's was OK but this movie had so much hype and the trailers looked fantastic. I watched it with my wife and son tonight and my god we struggled to the end. We all wanted to get up and leave as this is so boring and not scary at all. These reviews where people are saying it's scary and creepy are totally wrong. And the rating of R is a joke, this wouldn't scare a 10 year old. I am utterly disappointed in this and it's by far the worse adaptation of a Stephen king book fever. Save yourself some money and watch something else.",1,6,11,23 September 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Over hyped but good movie
",Move was good but not great. Lots of plot holes and movie felt way too dragged out. No real surprises since you saw everything coming. My son and I would rate this as the 3rd best Avengers movie. Infinity war being better and the original.,7,3,7,27 April 2019
