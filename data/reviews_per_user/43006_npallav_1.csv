Sucker Punch," This ones for the Big Screen!
","This one completely took me off guard!! Watched the movie on the day of the release and it honestly took me quite sometime to figure out where the plot was heading. The surprises continue right up to the end and as the movie's story progresses. Emily Browning portraying an unlikely piggy tail school girl does a good job of a high adrenaline action role. Zack Snyder,a fantastic job again! The movie boasts of Amazing screenplay, a very well thought of story line and absolutely exciting visual effects. A special mention on the OSTs which are well timed and perfectly in line with the theme of the movie. No doubts the movie is very well meant for the big screen. ... Overall a Stunning movie!!",9,4,9,27 March 2011
