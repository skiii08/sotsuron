Marie Antoinette," This movie is very majestic in its scenery and pageantry But.......
","This movie is very majestic in its scenery and pageantry. The historical accuracy, is highly praisable . The casting crew made an excellent choice of Kirsten Dunst as Marie Antoinette. The casting of the other cast members was equally well chosen. Ms. Sofia Coppola has done an overall marvelous job in directing the movie, making sure it all fell together nicely. This reviewer, however, felt let down by the sound track. The movie very inappropriately inserts rock music into the main title, and at various scenes throughout the movie. Not only were these rock selection inappropriate, they were louder then the main level of all other sound parts of the movie. Some of the sound track was great with compositions that were time era specific. One can only hope that Ms. Coppola will rethink the inappropriateness of these rock selections in this otherwise superb movie. I most however give it a failing mark as the sound track has got to be the back bone to the entire movie. This sound track on the whole weakens the movie through it's distracting nature.",4,1,2,4 December 2006
