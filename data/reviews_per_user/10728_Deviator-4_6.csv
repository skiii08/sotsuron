Casablanca," The best
",Casablanca is the best movie ever made. It has the best love story ever put in a movie.  The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman made them two of my favorite actors to date.,10,2,2,16 August 1998
Saving Private Ryan," wow
","While watching the first twenty-five minutes of Saving Private Ryan all that I could think of was 'Oh, Jesus, Oh, Jesus' Which is what I'm sure the men were thinking when they landed on Omaha Beach that day. Bullets were flying through men like they were tin foil. This movie IS the most realistic war movie ever made.  When thinking of D-Day, most people think of a glorious battle that helped turn the tide of war. In reality it was a large group of men trying to stay alive in whatever way they could.  This movie is not an anti-war film, whoever says it is is wrong. This movie depicts war the way it is. Those men gave their lives for their country and saved many others.  However, all the people who see Army advertisements and are thinking of joining need to see this film first.",10,0,0,16 August 1998
X2: X-Men United," Yeah!
",This movie is awesome because: It didn't screw up Nightcrawler. The Action was top Notch. Wolverine slashed the $#!^ out of many faceless bad guys. The special effects blow every other movie this year out of the water. And...Oh my god!  Good acting in an action movie.,10,0,0,5 May 2003
The Matrix," the best yet
","From the beginning of The Matrix all the way to the end, I was amazed and impressed.  I'm not going to touch base on the plot, but it is something that has never been in any movie that I've ever heard of. The Matrix is laden with seamless special effects and the best camera angles in a movie to date. Bullet's cartridges pour over the tops of the camera lenses, shells are clearly shown being released from the side of the guns, and those are just a few of the great camera angles. Plus...the action sequences. The fight sequences, gunfights, explosions, and chase scenes are all done with a precision that is rarely achieved in any movie today. They all contain genuine intensity, originality, and perfect choreography. For an action movie, it's a long film, but the running time goes unnoticed. There are some plot holes, but not any considerable ones. At the beginning, some of the performances were a little bland, by the thirty minute mark of the movie, the entire cast is at their best. This movie tops off Terminator 2, Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and John Woo's 1989 classic 'The Killer' as the best action movie of all time. The only thing that has a chance at beating it this year is Star Wars: Episode 1.",10,0,0,30 March 1999
Gladiator," People give this movie too much credit
","Although it was not a bad movie, it was not all that good of a movie either. Ridley Scott seems to get more entertaining scripts every time he directs, but he gets worse and worse at directing. The battle scenes drove me up the wall.  The cameras are so close-up that all we can see is blood and movement.  The resolution is grainy and dirty looking, which makes it even harder to see.  Scott must also believe that the only way to show battle is by filming it like a music video.  A few seconds of a camera shot is shown, then a second of another shot, then another shot, then another and another for five minutes straight.  Now it's not only hard to see, but dizzying as well.  A better director would have used longer shots to show off good fight choreography, development and tactics of battle. But Scott takes the easy way out.Now we know we can't rely on the director for a good movie. The cast overall is good.  Commodus (Phoenix) has a few good moments, but is just too dull to be enjoyed as a villain.  Scott tries to give us pity for the bad guy to add depth to his character, but it doesn't work.  I didn't feel anything for him, hatred or pity.  I was a little surprised that Phoenix wasn't better than he was in the role of Commodus.  He is a talented actor and he was by far the best part of '8mm', but he will work for this movie.  The supporting cast does a good job in few scenes that they posses.  The gladiators are big and mean enough, the senators do their job to move the story along, but the best supporting performances come out of Proximo (Reed) and Commodus's sister, Lucilla(Nielson). As important as the supporting cast is, everything rides on Crowe's performance as Maximus. He does wonderful.  He carries this movie on his back with little help.  He broods and glares and doesn't talk much.  He has great reaction shots and is a good physical actor.  Without him, this movie has little redeeming qualities.With Crowe leading the charge, the movie is marginally entertaining and worth going to see.  But don't sit to close to the screen, the camera shots might make you nauseous.",7,0,0,7 May 2000
Jurassic Park," awesome
","This movie is my favorite thriller of all time(Jaws takes close second). Maybe it's just the kid in me, but I loved watching the dinosaurs. The acting is good, and the special effects are seamless. Go see it if you havn't.",10,5,7,16 August 1998
