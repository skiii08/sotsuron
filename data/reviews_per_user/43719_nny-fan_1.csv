The King's Speech," Frivolous
","SPOILER WARNINGThis is one of the most frivolous movies I've ever seen. The film tries to be deep sometimes, but the fact is that it's just a shallow story about the speech problem of one of England's kings...I don't live in a monarchic country, so perhaps that's the reason I didn't understand the meaning of the king's speech problem. I mean, he could have made his radio speeches recorded and edited. If he didn't have problems having someone taking staged photos of him, I don't see why he just couldn't have his speeches recorded and fixed.The acting and dialogue was well done, but the story is so shallow to me that I think this is a completely forgettable movie.",1,9,31,1 June 2013
