Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fact : This movie truly disappointed me
","I didn't read the book, so that's not why I was disappointed. I had to try really hard to ignore the ' fact' that this movie was trying to remotely use any credible history of Abraham Lincoln. I think it did a better job convincing me of the possibility of real life vampires . I guess connecting a story about vampires to a very well know historical character helped bring needed curiosity to sell the movie, but they just didn't pull it off for me. The movie fell way too short for me on being either entertaining or enlightening . So if history means anything to you, this movie might get under your skin a bit. But of course when it comes to Hollywood history happens the way they write it.",4,0,2,29 December 2012
World War Z," Not as bad as i thought , but not as good as i'd hoped
","First off , I am a Zombie movie fan. I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and i'm a big fan of The Walking Dead. I've never read the book to this movie , so i don't have anything to compare in that regard. After watching the trailer to this movie , i have to say i wasn't entirely excited about it. The whole running/ant-like movement of these zombies didn't seem to fit what i like about zombie movies. This movie just looked like it was going to be just another action movie with zombies inserted in as the antagonist. I wasn't to thrilled about Brad Pitt playing the lead role either. I like Brad Pitt , he is a good actor , but just hard to see him in this role. So as you can see i had some mixed feelings going into this movie. Well after finally seeing the movie, there was one word that best described this movie for me - 'incomplete'. I felt like this was the beginning of a story (and perhaps it is). If i knew for certain that this movie was a part 1 of ? then the movie would have given me more closure. Overall still worth a watch in my opinion",6,1,3,2 July 2013
