Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Brilliant Masterpiece
","'The Phantom Menace' is the kind of movie that makes you have a good time and feel like a child for 2 hours.The film has an excellent screenplay and a story with a 'circular' structure. This means that the story starts in a certain place and ends in the same location.In another user comment I read the term 'Disney movie' used in an offensive way. George Lucas always said that his intention with the Star Wars movies was to create a modern serial with Disney elements on it.'The Phantom Menace' works very well because it has a story told in a proper way and with some humor elements like the Jar Jar Binks character.Also, this movie is different from the others Star Wars films: is more like a space fairy tale involving a queen, knights and castles.I saw it three times!!!!May the FORCE be with you",10,0,0,20 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," An awful mess!!!!!
","'Eyes Wide Shut' is like a modern 'french' film: no plot, no logic, no premise. In a few words: no story!!!!This so called 'movie' deals with sexual obsessions and psychological infidelity. The problem is that Kubrick can't show it to the audience when he doesn't have a story to tell!!!I also think that the photography looks like an MTV video (in every single shot) and the editing is slow and boring.",1,2,5,20 July 1999
