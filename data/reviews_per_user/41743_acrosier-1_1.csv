Mission: Impossible III," What i thought
","This is the real mission impossible this is how, this move is supposed to be, i was impressed with how J.J. Abrams did lost, but he just proved himself again in his first feature length film. If you are a fan of lost you will love this movie. Hopefully he will be making many more movies to come because i will be there to see them. Movies like this is the reason i still spend the outrageous amount of money to go theaters to see them. I have already been three times to see this, so if your in the mood for an action packed movie MI:III is the movie, your looking for. I hope everyone that see's this movie loves it as much as i did. J.J Abrams should get some recognition for this movie, but he won't just because it just another action movie, and thats not what the critics are looking for.",10,2,5,18 May 2006
