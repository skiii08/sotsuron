Sucker Punch," Babes, Epic Fights, Gun Fu but a little too much Baywatch.
","Overall it was an enjoyable picture. The action sequences were great with the exception of the over use of slow motion. It has it's place but there was too much of it for my taste. If all the action sequences took on more of the pace of Equilibrium I wouldn't have found it as annoying. It's an action movie, so it's short on story but why would you come watching it for anything other than what it is? Overall I'd say that if you like anime, comic books, have ever played an RPG, or are a fan of chicks and guns it's worth your time. If you don't like such things this probably isn't for you. Unfortunately for Sucker Punch it will be compared to 300 because of the way it looks and despite the fights being equally epic, we've seen it before.",6,1,7,25 March 2011
