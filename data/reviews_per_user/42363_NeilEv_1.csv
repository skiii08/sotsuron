First Man," Neil Armstrong was the Accidental Hero of the Space Age
","Technically well made, but cold as deep space. Armstrong was so emotionally constrained that he couldn't open up to his family or co-astronauts. Before leaving for Apollo 11, he sits down with his two sons and says, 'Does anyone have any other questions?' as if they're at a press conference. In the last scene he's quarantined after returning from the Moon. His wife walks into an adjacent room where they're separated by a glass wall. They express no joy in his safe return and don't even touch hands on the glass, like they do in all prison films. Armstrong was the accidental hero of the space age.",8,1,6,13 October 2018
