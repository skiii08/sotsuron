Minority Report," A great movie but...
","This movie is great and I would've given it and 8 but there's to many plot holes and I can't give it more than 7. I would say the misdirection they did with Danny Witwer and how it seems that he set John up was great and I didn't see it coming.(or maybe there wasn't a misdirection at all and I'm just dumb for thinking that)
In the beginning I thought they were gonna show that maybe knowing the future is what causes that future and therefore the Precogs are not always right but they didn't go that way and I don't think it is a flaw for the movie but just my assumption that maybe the movie is gonna go in that direction but my assumptions doesn't make sense now that I watched the whole movie.
And again the movie would've been better if it didn't have all these plot holes.
I was gonna say the biggest plot hole was that the cops didn't show up for the Crow death but my stupid ass remembered that they couldn't find the building cuz there are a lot of them. They still had 36H to find it OR they could've just sent some drones in air to scan the buildings through windows for John as they clearly could, you can't tell me that they just let it go and waited to hear about the murder then go after it! They use robot spiders that can scan a whole building full of people in it but they can't send drones scan some windows?So for the most obvious plot hole I would say that John is on the run but he still manages to enter the facility and use HIS OWN EYE to get verified and enter and no one's gonna notice? If your officer is accused and is on the run wouldn't the first thing you do(well after chasing him) be revoking his security access? They can find him wherever his eyes get scanned and there's a lot of those scanners out there but they can't know when his eyes get scanned in their own building?The next plot hole you're not gonna believe what it is. Yes, at the end of the movie John gets captured and they put him on those things and his wife is again able to use HIS EYE to get inside? wtf? where's the logic in that? First of all why is there no guards for the prison? Not one? What about security camera in there to see who goes in who gets out? No? Ok!
So this guy that you know he used his clearance to get inside and snatch the most precious Precog, and now he is in that prison STILL has access to your facility? How dumb are these cops? And the movie proudly explains that she used his eye to get in there! Seriously?John's left eye is scanned by the Spiders. This is 6 hours after surgery. He was told multiple times not to open his eyes for 12 hours or he would go blind. They never address that for the rest of the movie at all!(though the eye does look damaged).The whole idea of Precogs being able to see the future is confusing and in the beginning they say that Precogs can only see murders but later in a scene where Agatha and John are running from the cops she somehow can see the everything that's gonna happen? You could say that maybe they just see murders when they are dreaming and she can see all the future because she's awake and she's the most powerful Precog, but it's just a theory cuz they never explain it.They say that the brown balls are for when the crime is premeditated and the guy planned for it but John didn't even know who Crow at that point. And yes maybe Burgess set up some leads in John's house for him to find out about Crow but still, he doesn't know him and the ball should be... blue maybe? Idk",7,0,0,6 November 2019
Memento," A mindblowing movie
","This movie is very unique and Nolan is a master at making superb films. The editing is so good don't know why it didn't win an Oscar for it. The acting is very good from all the characters and definitely from Carrie-Anne Moss. That scene with her getting into her car is the best scene of the movie.Only problem I have with this movie is that the ending twist wasn't shocking at all, like, I don't mean it wasn't shocking shocking but that the narrative of the movie was in a way that in the end you still don't know if this is the real twist or Teddy is lying and it's not true and there's gonna be another twist. That's what I felt when I reached that scene, I thought it's another one of 'those' sequences and there's gonna be another 'before' scene but then I checked the run time and it was 5 mins to the end of the movie and I was like 'oh I guess this is it, this is the final twist and the truth about the whole story.'But that's just how I felt, it's not something inherently wrong with the movie.
just because of the narrative I wasn't expecting this to be the big twist. Still a great movie though.",9,1,2,12 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Hell Yeah!

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," What an amazing movie
","Edgar Wright does it again with another banger and I honestly don't know why I haven't watched this movie till now, but I'm glad I did because it's one of the craziest, sometimes funniest and most stylish movies I've ever seen. And the editing is just amazing. At the beginning it was kinda weird but as the movie progresses through and you get what you're dealing with, it becomes one of the most fun movies you'll ever seen. And the fight scenes are pretty great. The fight scenes kinda reminded me of Legion the tv show, that show is also very creative and cool like this and might even inspired from this movie. All in all a great movie don't miss it out.",9,0,0,28 June 2020
Quantum of Solace," One of the worst edited movies you'll ever see...
","First of all let me say what a horrendous opening song, the music at the begging is amazing and JB-like and you're like yeah let's go it's gonna be the best Bond song ever, then the vocals hit you and you're like 'oh god no wtf is this sht stop it please', the song is just horrible, both singers succ azz but the male one succs more. There's a Shirley Bassey song that the same composer made and wrote that I don't know why tf they didn't use that. The director doesn't know w tf he's doing, the editor is having a seizure, there's no real plot in this movie and the movie is the same generic 2000's action movie with a forgettable baddie and it has the somehow worse editing than Taken 3, honestly with how they gave and Oscar to the Bohemian Rhapsody for editing I don't know how they didn't even nominate this movie for best editing!
I think heard that it was the same time as the Writers Strike and they didn't have a real writer for this movie so the director just macgyvered the script and they went with it. Like jesus, couldn't you wait a year or two then hire a good writer for the movie and also a better director? It's not like you're gonna lose the right for the movie or people gonna forget about JB!This should've been a worthy and competent sequel to the amazing Casino Royale movie but it's just a huge disappointment and the movie stinks and there's really nothing in this movie that you're gonna like.",6,0,0,6 April 2020
Toy Story 4," Not bad at all!
","Ok so I understand these 1 star and 2 stars reviews and how they think their childhood is ruined, cause when I was watching the movie it didn't feel like the masterpiece the last installment was because the 3rd movie is still the best in the series and this one, in your first watch doesn't feel like a Toy Story movie. Some people may think that the villain was weak compared to Lots-o and I agree, but they did something different with the villain this time!But still, if you put you negative thoughts away and watch the movie again you realize it wasn't waste of time or a 'bad' toy story at all, it wasn't just another movie about toys and their adventures because they actually did something with their characters, they didn't just made a movie about a new made up toy and how Woody is gonna save him and keep him with Donnie and in the end the villain is defeated and the gang is back together and it's all good.If you watch the movie again you realize they've been setting the Woody departure
from the beginning and it's a good character development because the character can move on now instead of doing the same thing for 4 movies just tossing to another baby's arms. So if you thing the departure was forced and uncalled for, watch the movie again and you'll see the whole movie was about this. If the ending didn't happen and it was like the other installments I wouldn't have given this a 8 because the movie would've been unnecessary and uncalled for.But they developed the character of Woody to the next level, they Did something new with character! as for the villain I think it would've been better if they included more evil scenes with her and her terrifying henchmen but still I like what they did with the villain, you might think it's a little bit anticlimactic but if they did the same thing to her as they did with Lots-o, then what's the point? You want to see the same movie again?I agree with the people who are saying that the trilogy was perfect and didn't need a forth one but the ending makes up for it being unnecessary because the main character moves on to the next chapter and isn't stuck in this endless loop.The characters of Key & Peele in this movie were hilarious and they didn't ruin the movie at all. Duke Caboom was also a good character.The cinematography was amazing, there's no camera in making of this movie but it's made the way that you think that they actually did capture it on a camera.Now I'm gonna talk about some thing that I didn't like about this movie:<ul><li>Donnie all of a sudden doesn't even acknowledge Woody and doesn't care about him anymore.</li></ul><ul><li>There's not a lot of Woody and Buzz scenes and this being the last movie Woody is with the gang I didn't like that there wasn't much scene with these two together.</li></ul><ul><li>They could've develop the villain more. As I said the 3rd one was a masterpiece and of course they can't top Lots-o but I expected a little more.</li></ul><ul><li>The story of the whole Forky and the antique store was kinda not engaging and urgent like the last movie where all those familiar characters where stuck in the kindergarten. But you can understand why Woody wanted to keep Forky safe for Donnie. BUT ALL OF THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED IF DONNIE JUST PLAYED WITH THE DAMN WOODY.</li></ul>",8,2,5,2 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Thank you Johnson very cool
","Everything that has to be said had been said already. I just wish that some other company would buy this franchise and make good SW movies(in a parallel universe maybe). Or at least put someone like Kevin Feige in charge, someone who gives a sht about the series and doesn't just do anything he wants and ruin every character and hero people loved and cared for for over 40 years.",2,6,9,10 December 2019
Joker," Great movie
","This movie was great. Although it was more of an origin than actual Joker wreaking havoc but still great. Main lead's performance was great but sometimes it felt like he tried too hard. But still is not a perfect movie or a 'Masterpiece' as other people say but still great. I more prefer V for Vendetta, I know they're not exactly about the same idea but they're kinda are?! and also because I watched them both this week.",8,1,4,22 November 2019
Parasite," Holy Moly
","Out of 814 movies that I rated on this site, I only gave 9 of them the full 10/10 and this movie is one of them, so you go figure.",10,24,39,21 December 2019
