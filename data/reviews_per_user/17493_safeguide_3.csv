Skyfall," Worst Bond movie ever/ Like a Tom and Jerry Cartoon-no realism
","One of the worst movies among the Bond series mostly because there are many parts of it that is beyond believable.. I found myself trying really hard to believe what was going on only to get disgusted with the absolute fantasy of so much of it. It's like Tom and Jerry. Bond could get run over by a car, and the directors will make him just jump back up and run again. Unbelievable story sequences throughout the movie made me cringe and want to leave the movie or throw something at the screen.. Bond using a earthmover on a moving train to bridge a separating train compartment. He gets shot at hundreds of times in close range and just gets minimally injured while bullet prints are all over his seat. While he climbs the earthmover's arm to reach the other side of the train, the villain withholds fire and just stands there watching it. Just plain dumb. He cuts himself to get at shrapnel and heals in 48 hours. He gets a bullet through his shoulder and then does martial arts against a completely uninjured villain. Then at the end a couple of gas tanks get blown up and it unleashes firestorm in his mansion. Then a helicopter smashes into the mansion and another humongous explosion - just so unbelievable - Hollywood over the top tricks that leaves the viewer more frustrated than anything positive. I would not recommend this movie to anyone... it's just a plain waste of time and poor direction.",1,12,24,16 November 2012
Ted," Just plain vulgar and crude
","This is a story that tries to be funny by putting a dirty mouth, vulgar and sickening frat boy persona in a teddy bear. With all the skills of animating such a bear, it could have done something uplifting, but the happy ending is a sham. I felt tricked to watch this movie. It made me so upset that I actually wasted my time on this. I kept wishing there was some redeeming value to this movie but there wasn't. This movie puts the worst of human nature out there and makes it appear good. Who could come up with such a story line that is so nasty? The story line is so pathetic and uncreative telling a story that's been told many times over. Definitely not for your kids or teens. And people wonder why we have an attitude problem with young people in the US. This is a case in point.",1,42,79,16 November 2012
300," Worst, ahistorical film I've ever seen
","I saw the movie Saturday to a packed crowd. Our group went from the recommendation of some critics who claimed the film was one of the 'spectacular' must-sees of the year. How wrong we were to rely on that promise. To encapsulate: 1. The acting was one of the worst you'll see in film 2. The film lacks a compelling story. It does what 'cry freedom' and hero movies try to copy from the success of Braveheart for the last 5 years without the story, passion, and virtues that we can really cheer for. 3. Most of the movie is slow motion slaughter and bloodshed in CGI. Head's and limbs cut off, lots of spearing, and piles of dead bodies... 4. The film plays out like an allegory of the West vs Middle East politics of today. The Spartans hoot like dumb football players with each unreal success, while the East is made to look venal, monstrous, and the epitome of everyone's nightmares. 5. Story? None to speak of... If you've seen Gladiator, you've seen 300. The weirdness of stringent Spartan culture undermines the concept of family but the producers expect us to root for them nonetheless. 6. Imagination? Plot Twists? None.. I've heard and read about critics having to sit through the most excruciating 2 hours of their careers; for me, this was one of those moments. I kept expecting some exceptional to happen.. something redeeming, but there was none. 7. Xerxes and his gang comes off like a flamboyant, bodybuilding effeminate; his crew are either faceless and menacing, or lustful and saturated in orgies. Hard to imagine how someone like this can conquer nations. Leonitus and the Spartans come off like football playing jocks up against impossible odds. If you know history, this film will make you curse Hollywood for dumbing America and world with such banality. 8. If you must see it, wait for the video. It's not worth your money and the special effects are nothing noteworthy. You've seen it all before in the 'rings' series.Don't let the high stars scores on this film fool you, this film is a waste of time. I seriously want my money back.",1,20,44,17 March 2007
