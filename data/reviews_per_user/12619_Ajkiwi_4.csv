Walk the Line," *yawn* Good time warp, but ultimately unsatisfying
","While being an excellent capture of the place and time of Cash and his early career, this unsympathetic look at the one-note character of Cash and his obsession with his wife to be makes for little character interest or development, and has little story beyond 'this happened, then this happened, then this happened'. While the Folsom performance shows Phoenix NAILING the live Cash and letting rip some of the passion, the other music performances are weak in comparison. Not much happens in this film, and it takes a while to happen, too.Not a film that will be remembered by many other than Cash fans.",6,0,2,21 March 2006
Taxi Driver," Left in the dust by 'Bringing out the Dead'
","'Taxi driver', still shocking and disturbing, is far from the masterpiece it seemed when first released.  Watching it on DVD and listening to the cast discussing the film is revealing - the script is incredibly uneven, and events almost incidental to the main 'story', of Travis and his decline. 
The acting, timing, and direction still shine, but the far inferior script is shown up by the brilliant ad libs and character work of the actors.  For a far more complete view of Hell's Kitchen, and the other side of the darkness, you should really see the mature 'pseudosequel' to this, 'Bringing out the dead'.  Far more coherant, in script, acting, and direction, it shows up the many flaws in this underdeveloped mess.",7,0,2,10 April 2002
Saving Private Ryan," As insulting a piece of historical revisionism as ever has made it to film.
","There are good aspects to this movie - quite strong characterisation, the most stunningly horrific depiction of war ever, and a sensitive treatment of the subject matter.Of course, this is not to say that the subject matter is anything but the most insulting piece of American historical revisionism to cross our screens in years.  Apparently, Tom Hanks is STILL the conversative white all american hero (he hasn't played any other role in years, which tells you something about his self image, politics, and ego), the Americans were the only people involved in World War II, and all american values are the best thing to fight for.  They ALMOST covered the humanity of the germans...but no.  They almost mentioned other countries... but no.They ALMOST gave a treatment of war worthy of the first 20 minutes... oh hang on.  No they didn't.  They sunk into sentimentalism, flag waving, and Tom being a hero at the price of the story and quality.  Insulting to the memory of WWII vets from around the world.",8,0,0,22 January 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Pretty, plotfilled, but soulless...
","Everyone's already said it: This is almost exactly the Harry Potter world from the book.  Almost perfectly rendered, characters spot on, even if Harry was a little wooden, and has most of the action from the book.Which is, of course, the problem.I saw this movie with a bunch of kids in the rows in front of and behind me. The younger ones fell asleep.  No surprise there.  The older ones watched it, marvelled at it, compared it to their imagined versions, and... almost fell asleep.There is a lot to cram in to this movie.  But curiously, rather than rating some plot points as more important, others as less, this version of Harry contains EVERYTHING.  All the major plot points are there, with a couple of stripped down exceptions.  Faithful to the story - yes.  Faithful to the spirit of the books - no.  And the kids around me said it.'Where were all the jokes, Dad?' Asked one kid. 'Where was Lee Jordan's commentary of the quidditch,' asked another. 'It didn't FEEL like fun,' a third said as we walked out, probably the most telling comment of all.Rather than prioritising the plot points, we got the lot.  So the spirit of the books - the urgency, the glee, the fun, the joy - all disappeared.  We lost Harry's character... reduced to a quiet noone. - which is odd, coz all of the other characters were perfect! (Though Dumbledore needs a sense of humour, and the Wesley twins aren't 'bad' enough'...)A functional rendering of the book, but as one person said as we walked out: 'Value for money wise - I'd rather spend $18.95 on the book than $10 on that movie'.",6,0,1,29 November 2001
