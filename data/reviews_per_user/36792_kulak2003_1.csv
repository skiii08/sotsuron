Insidious: Chapter 2," what a piece of crap
","Do not waste your money. This is garbage. There is no plot and I should have left in the opening credits. I saw the first one and it was OK. Please Do not make a third one.Most of Chapter 2 is unintentionally hilarious. A clumsy and muddled follow up to the original; too many tricks and not enough treats. The most slapped-together, pointless, allover terrible horror film of 2013; and I will remind you that 2013 bore witness to Texas Chainsaw 3D. What a boring film. I feel sorry for the actors who had to star in this.It relies on cheap thrills and fails to generate consistent suspense, while lacking the sharp sense of humor that kept the first film from bogging down",1,4,11,10 October 2013
