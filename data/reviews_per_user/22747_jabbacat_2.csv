The Blair Witch Project," It pulls you in...
","I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' this afternoon.  I really liked it.  Some people didn't like the shaky cameras--it made me feel like I was in those woods too...Kind of like those virtual movies about the ocean or riding a roller coaster.The actors in this film all seemed to be living a real life.  Not once did I feel like they were reading 'lines'.  That made the documentary premise work for me.  They may be no-names at this point, but mark my words....not for long.  Especially the actress who played Heather.If I hadn't known when I went in that it was fiction, I think it may have given me a heart attack.  Even still, I was scared.  I don't get scared at movies, but I was scared at this one.  This movie will be making a BIG appearance at next years Academy Awards.  Very well done.  Not your typical horror flick--and that's GOOD!",Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," That's 2 1/2 hours I'll never get back
","I saw 'Eyes Wide Shut' on opening night in a packed theater expecting to see a great film.  I didn't get what I paid for.I found myself checking my watch at least six times throughout the excruciatingly l-o-n-g movie and waiting for the story to pick up the pace. The dialog was so slow it seemed everyone was drunk and trying to pass a sobriety test.I also noticed a continuity error/editing error that was so obvious it screamed at me.  (two tables in hall, one statue on each--next shot both statues on right table)  That piano was just annoying, the Christmas trees were all horrible and the hype of Tom & Nicole in a top secret sex flick was just hype.  I'm not goo-goo over Tom Cruise but if his wife will bare all, shouldn't he?  In fact, must I sit through countless naked women and not see a single naked man?  That's equality. The characters weren't believable and the story was pointless.  What a waste.",Null,1,2,3 August 1999
