Sucker Punch," The imagination of Zack Snyder
","If you are not familiar with Zack Snyder movies you got work to do. His imagination is great awesome, with movies like 300, Watchmen and Dawn of the Dead. The story of Sucker Punch is pretty simple if you think it, We encountered Baby Doll(Emily Browning) who is sent to a mental institute where she is going to have a lobotomy in 5 days. She encounters with other girls(portrayed by Abbie Cornish, Emily Chung, Jena Malone and Vanessa Hudgens in an attempt to forget her HSM role) and they have to (in one way to tell)get away from the enemy of the movie Blue Jones(Guatemalan Oscar Isaac). They enter in a world where your imagination is everything and they have to find 5 things. Like the tag line 'you will be unprepared' this movie has a very original story 'maybe too much original for the USA residents' If you like girls, guns and action with a bit of story you will love Sucker Punch.",8,4,9,30 March 2011
Captain America: The First Avenger," The first taste of an epic story.
","Captain America: The First Avenger.The film tell us the origins of the Captain, The war and the Villain.Story 8/10. Is based in the comic book, but it has some faults. Some deaths that shouldn't exist. Some geographic, time-line errors. But besides that is a great story.Special Effects 7/10. For a Marvel/Disney movie some effects are pure CGI. I'm not talking TF3 CGI but it abuses sometimes. Specially in the scene where Captain meets the Villain. Acting 9/10. Chris Evans has to be, with Robert Downey Jr the best casting for The Avengers. He is the Captain America, his acting as 'Little Steve' is a great performance (making us forget of the Fantastic Four). Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter is a good actress, Her scenes with Chris are better by far than the Portman-Hemsworth or Paltrow-Downey. Sebastian Stan has a small role but it delivers a great acting as Bucky Barnes. Overall the casting was way good. And they know how to act!!The movie is enjoyable, is the best of the marvel films yet.... Works, is not bored. Great movie.",8,6,13,30 July 2011
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher is a Bad Movie.
","The idea is simply a bad teacher(Diaz) who smokes and curses students is dumped by her fianc√© and she mets the substitute teacher(Timberlake) and tries to win it.OK, it sounds like a good comedy movie. But it fails.The first hour is bad, OK it has some jokes and some good moments but you cant make a movie just of jokes.The acting is poorly. After watching Timberlake in The Social Network I thought he could be a great actor but this movie was a bad choice for him. Diaz tries to bring her career back but it doesn't work.Lucy Punch and Jason Segel are the best things of the movie. Segel is funny person but is wasted in the movie. In the first hour he is vanished.Overall, is like Bad Santa but a bit funny.Maybe is good for a raining afternoon with some popcorn in your living room.",4,9,19,24 June 2011
Insidious," Scares (well for a Pg-13)
","From the guys of Saw (The original masterpiece not the 6 other movies) it comes this movie with its title INSIDIOUS (which can be meaning also as Malicious).The Beginning is one of the best scene i have seen in a lot of time in one movie, the story is kinda simple A kid in comma is being haunted by some evil spirits and his parents are trying to prevent that to happen. (without get in spoilers) The ending is as well as good like the begin.The Story is good, The acting has his good parts with a Patrick Wilson(Watchmen, Hard Candy) sometimes inspired, a Rose Byrne mixed up (28 weeks later, Knowing) and a Ty Simpkins scary. The dialog fail in some parts but sustains the movie in a good way. For being a movie of the guys of Saw is surprising that there is no blood and guts.In average Insidious is a scary movie that gives sometimes some good scares(for a PG-13 Movie).",7,7,13,3 April 2011
Cars 2," Not the best of Pixar
","I enjoy kids movies, I really do. But this fails to deliver a great story. Cars was a good movie with a great plot. But Cars 2 was a mix of stories. The sequels are never like the first one and this is not the exception.The cars aren't developed enough to care about them. Mater(Larry the cable guy) fails. He was funny at the first one but now he is simply annoying. International espionage? Really? I Don't think that was a good idea for the plot. The 3-D is kinda useless like it happen with Kung Fu Panda 2. Maybe not all movies have to be made in 3-D.Overall, was a bit enjoyable in some parts but if you are waiting for a great sequel you are going to get disappointed.",6,45,82,24 June 2011
Super 8," Is not Cloverfield 2 neither E.T
","Great movie. Good Story. Nice Acting.JJ Abrahms again demonstrates us that he can make a movie that is going to keep your attention all the way. The sense of fear that the actors gives you delivers well.Spielberg hand is demonstrated here. Is not E.T and thank God is not E.T. But you feel like watching a monster movie for the family.The critics told that it was like a Cloverfield prequel/sequel but not. The monster gives a sensation of terror.The bad thing of Super 8 was all the viral things. Like in the Cloverfield time. The Super 8 page with the Editing Room, Development Room and clips appearing every day, 2 days.Is very enjoyable.",7,0,1,25 June 2011
Thor," The only God of The Avengers
","After seeing it in a Special Screening I only have to say it. Wow, I wasn't expecting that, I knew that Kenneth Branagh is a great Director but the way that he translate the story and the comic into life was marvelous.The acting is good, the actors bring the characters to life, Hemsworth brings an excellent Thor (maybe the wrestler fighter Triple H was a better choice because has more the look of Nordic),with an splendid Odin(Hopkins) and a great Loki(Hiddleston).The only failure that I can find is the size of the hammer, if you have seen the trailer you will know what I am saying, I think was too small for the size of Thor but besides that the movie is great.The 3D in this movie was good but sometimes is a bit unnecessary.8/10 for some dialogs and some excessive use of Special Effects.",8,14,29,26 April 2011
X-Men: First Class," X-Men gets a decent movie.
","OK, I liked the first X-Men movie of Bryan Singer. But the X-3 and the X-Men Origins:Wolverine was bad. So I was hoping for a decent movie this time and it delivers.The story is simple. You get to know Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr relationship since they know each other and the story of what causes the eternal fight of Mutants against Mutants.James McAvoy is a magnificent Xavier and Michael Fassbender is a awesome Magneto. They scenes are the best of the movie. The rest of the actors are good. Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne and Jennifer Lawrence gives good acting.It has some flaws in the date accuracy and if this movie is a prequel for the other 3 x-men movies it has some flaws.Overall, It works, is great and make you forget Brett Ratner movies.",8,0,1,25 June 2011
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," It ends in an amazing way.
","We have been witness of the Harry Potter mania since the first movie came 10 years ago. We have seen the actors grow in front of our eyes for 7 movies. And yesterday it all ended with the 8th movie.Withouth getting in spoilers...... The fighting sequences are great to the view, the special effects don't seem very wasted. Every match perfectly to create a great environment.The acting is great. The three main characters make a great work in all the movie delivering their feelings. Ralph Fiennes as Voldermort is perfect. Ruper Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson shouldn't have problems to get roles in a future. Hey Emma even has a role in Perks of being a wallflower so they have a good future coming.But not all is perfect. The environment is dark and that is good because the movie has to be dark, the reason of this commentary is because of the 3D. The 3D works good in light environment (Avatar, Tron with the neon lights, even Thor makes that work) but in this movie which almost all the time is pass in a dark place the 3D don't seems to work very good. Overall, is a great movie to end an epic saga. Just don't waste your money in the 3D, is not that worthy.",9,0,2,15 July 2011
