The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Writer of the book + director of the movie = win
","Let's make it clear from the beginning: I'm a big fan of this movie so this review may be a little bit biased, but aren't them all? I have watched this movie twice, the first time was when it was still in theaters and the second time was 1 hour ago. I have experienced the same joy at both times, this is rare enough to underline it. This movie just amazes me.As far as I'm concerned it has everything in it, well every good thing you could expect from a movie. It has, of course, a love story, a troubled main character, a high school as a decor, at the first sight it looks like another teen movie. I can assure you: it is not! It has so much to offer to you, I bet you're going to think about this movie for a while after you've watched it. I know I did. Well enough for an introduction, let's get into it.You've surely read the summary already, if not go ahead and read it. This movie is about a boy who just entered high school. He had some problems in the past and he's hoping to get past it. His first days of school don't go too well until he meets Patrick and Sam, two peculiar people. Even though they're in last year and Charlie is still a freshman they accept him in their group of friends. I won't spoil you anymore.This movie is based on a book that I read after the first time I saw it. The writer of the book is the director of the movie and this is so great I couldn't emphasize this more. The movie has almost everything from the book in it and it is all sheer marvel. It explains so truly how high school is without clich√© and the character of Charlie is really well written. I've also had some problems in life, I guess everybody had, and I've recognized myself so many times in Charlie it just makes the movie more grandiose. Then you've got Sam who is just beautiful and makes you want to kiss her all the time. This movie really brings me powerful emotions. I will not go through every single character, I hope this review has made you want to see this movie. Go and watch it then!Enjoy!",10,2,4,12 October 2013
