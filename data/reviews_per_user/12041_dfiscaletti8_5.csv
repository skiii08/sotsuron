Casablanca," Review for Casablanca
","Casablanca is a movie title that everyone has heard of and many talk about, so naturally I was excited to see it. Well yet again this 'classic' let me down. I would not say it was a bad movie in anyway it just was not all that exciting or interesting. It seems to me that they focused on the something miniscule and the message the movie was portraying wasn't all that important, it was not until the very end when my attention was actually grabbed and I was enjoying the movie. I suppose because the movie didn't follow the traditional build up, climax, fall down set up it kind of threw me off. There were moments throughout the movie that grabbed me though, there was also a little bit of surprise here and there which I also enjoyed. Although the movie itself did not impress me that much, the art work within the movie was astonishing. Inside Rick's caf√© it was beautifully decorated, especially in the scenes when looking down from the balcony stairs looking over all the guests and performers. The movie also played with shadows very well, casting the right mood and making everything look flawless. I wouldn't say the acting was amazing, actually I really didn't even like Humphrey Bogart . It may just have been his character, but I flat out didn't like him. Ingrid Bergman did an alright job, but once again nothing special. Just like the entire film, not impressive. The ending was another thing I found disappointing, I like love stories to have a happy ending, not a practical one.",Null,2,4,12 October 2012
Apocalypse Now," review for Apocalypse Now
","Apocalypse Now started off with a confusion which made it hard to become interested, but the use of loud noises and action did manage to keep me somewhat involved. However, I was impressed with the film work and effects due to the time period, but it was still hard to pay attention. As the movie went on it continued getting strange which made it difficult to pay attention; the movie lacked interest and depth so did not see the point to try to understand what was going on when I was not the least bit interested, if anything I did not like it one bit. Besides the strange plot and actions the message in the movie itself is disappointing. It puts down the war veterans of the Vietnam War making it seem as if they were more interested doing drugs and being crazy that fighting for their country. This movie may have had a slightly intriguing plot, but it was nothing special. I was in no way impressed by this film and I would not recommend it on any circumstances.",2,1,4,16 December 2012
The Graduate," review for The Gradute
","The Graduate was a very entertaining film; nothing really tuned me off completely while watching it. It was a little slow and unbelievable at some points as it seemed to drag, but over all I found myself enjoying the story and laughing along the way. The love between Ben and Elaine seems very far-fetched, no one really exhibits behavior for one another the way the two of them did, however the humor Mike Nichols incorporates leads the audience to believe that the entire story is very lackadaisical. As for acting Dustin Hoffman did a phenomenal job (as always) playing Benjamin, a nervous lost college graduate, he was very convincing as he developed every aspect of his role. The other actors did a fine job as well helping support the story, but nothing that impressive to go on about. On another note there were a lot of fascinating uses of editing to make this film standout amongst others of its time like different angles, cuts, use of modern day music, and the use of nudity. Although the story line itself seems a little questionable and lacks interest Mike Nichols keeps the audience's attention with the use of unique editing techniques, impressive acting, and the perfect harmony of humor and significance.",Null,0,0,29 November 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Review for Singin in the Rain
","Singing in the Rain definitely met every expectation I had and then some. I hadn't heard much about the movie, but the name was very familiar and anything I had heard about the movie was very positive. In the beginning it was a little slow, but as soon as the singing and the dancing started I couldn't not stop smiling, I enjoyed every moment of it. The color of course was amazing, especially compared to all the black and white movies I have been seeing. But the talent of the actors is what makes this movie. Gene Lockwood and Donald O'Connor are a great pair together as they dance many duets, never missing a beat and always staying on key. I found their tap dancing to be amazing. The singing also blew me away; Gene Lockwood Donald O'Connor, and Debbie Reynolds are triple threats as the acted, sung, and danced their hearts out. I never thought I would enjoy a musical and was kind of nervous to have to review this movie, but I must say this has to be one of the best movies I have ever see, it really blows me away. I found this film absolutely entertaining and would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat.",10,0,2,1 November 2012
Psycho," Review for Psycho
","Finally a good thriller. Horror movies are by far my favorite and I must say Alfread Hitchcock did a great job of casting a sense of fear. The movie started off a little slow, the story line was kind of boring to follow,and the acting really wasn't the best; but for some reason I still found the movie entertaining and convincing. During the horror scenes and the ending is when the movie really got interesting and even though the music was incredibly cheesy it worked well with the film. I enjoyed the fact that this movie didn't just focus on murder, it also played with the idea of being a true 'psycho' by portraying the murderer with multiple personality disorder or maybe even schizophrenia.I can understand why this movie is a classic horror film and I think any fan of the genre needs to see this film, if they haven't already. It sets the framework for may horror films that have been produced later on and gives a certain standard they have to meet.",7,0,0,2 November 2012
