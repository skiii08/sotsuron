First Man," Sad that a story of a great man was in the hands of self indulgent filmmakers
","This was a film you would hope would be in the same class as Apollo 13. Something inspirational that really stirs something inside of you. Unfortunately the story of Neil Armstrong was left in the hands of self indulgent filmmakers. The pace it moved at is painfully slow with unnecessary shots to add to the slow pace. Too many close up in which there would be no reasoning for them. The unsteady shaky cinamaphotography does work when they are punch through the atmosphere but doesn't belong in the scenes on the ground. From all of this I found it quite hard to escape into the story and focus on such a great man, and was more focused on the letdown the editing and camera work.I can say that the acting from all of the cast is still wonderful. Clair Foy is spectacular as always. In terms of costume, sets etc it was visually authentic and amazing to look at.",2,0,1,17 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Marvel dropped the ball with this one
","I will say firstly that as per usual the visual effects are outstanding. The de-aging of Fury and Colsen was perfection. But that's where my compliments end.I truely went into this believing that Marvel's first female hero led film would have a similar impact as Blank Panther had, all I can say is that DC won the battle of female hero film.This fell flat in so many ways. The storyline had massive pacing issues and the quaint humorous bits that Marvel has become quite famous for were few and seemed forced. Brie Larson's character was 1 dimensional, which with her acting chops has left me wondering if this was the fault of the director instead. With Captain Marvel being the most powerful hero in the line up they definitely missed an opportunity to show a storyline where her vulnerability is inside her mind and she has to fight to know her worth on her own, the storyline does that undercurrent but it just wasn't written well.Lastly a huge opportunity was missed with the soundtrack. After the brilliance that was Galaxy of Guardians soundtrack this journey back to the 90's was bleak. They hand picked iconic songs but just dropped them into the film with no relevance or flow.Overall you still need to see it as it's the next cog in the wheel before Endgame. It's also not the worst movie in the world so you won't feel like you've wasted money on a ticket. You will feel like Marvel has they're B group creating this film. I am getting slightly worried about Phase 4 now",4,5,11,9 March 2019
