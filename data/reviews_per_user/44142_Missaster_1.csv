The King's Speech," Wonderful piece of work.
","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I didn't know if I really wanted to see it, or if it was just the hype. As time went on I began to sink into it, and finally I rushed to the movies for this beautiful gem.The only thing I have to say is... I'm aching to see it again. And again... and again and again. It is, indeed, an incredible film. If you're into the history of the royal family, or just history itself, it's a great film to watch. My mother thought it was a little boring at times, and of course I respectfully disagreed with a passion.If you have the time, go see it. No regrets. It is - by far - the best movie I've seen in YEARS.Don't let some of the bad reviews keep you away.",10,1,3,11 February 2011
