Deja Vu," Big let down
","Usually the ratings at IMDb are a good predictor of how good a movie is. How different this turned out to be with Deja Vu! I cannot understand that anybody would give this movie a 6 or higher as a rating.To me it seems that Tony Scott had decided to make another action movie with a typical Hollywood-like love story in it. The kind he's so used to making. But then he thought 'well, let's do something different, let's try to be intellectual.' This film definitely tried but did not succeed at all. The first hour of the movie was okay but then the quasi-spiritual part started. About traveling back in time and changing history. Including communication with the past, a high speed chase with someone who was driving there 4 days ago (hard to understand? not my fault) and Denzel Washington being morphed back in time like it's no big deal or anything.So, what was the message of this movie? Is it okay to change the past just like that? And how about this: in the attack over 500 people died but the reason why the main character wanted to turn back what had happened was because of this one girl and his partner in the police force. Kind of a selfish thing but hey, maybe that's how the directors see nowadays society...",3,1,3,24 December 2006
