The Rock," Welcome to The Rock!
","It's Die Hard on Alcatraz this time, ladies and gentlemen. It seems that now everybody's trying to do a hostage situation in certain movies after the first Die Hard made an impact on audience lives from Cliffhanger (Die Hard on Rocky Mountains), Speed (Die Hard on a bus) and now the 1996 movie 'The Rock' directed by Michael Bay, who more or less is known for making high octane action movies with a plot for people not to think about. Here Michael makes an attempt to make to mix action, cool characters and an edge-of-your-seat adventure with an all-star cast.The film's premise has General Hummel (Ed Harris) robbing nuclear weapons and using Alcatraz as a base filled with members of a tour where with the weapons he could melt half a city after a big impact and asking the government a heavy ransom before releasing a missile. The F.B.I. brings in chemical specialist Stanley Goodspeed (Nicholas Cage), a neurotic agent who doesn't say bad words and knows everything about every chemical ever made. Goodspeed gets a partner, a convict by the name of John Mason (Sean Connery), an ex-agent for the British Intelligence who doesn't know that his deal of being released is being cut by an old rival of the F.B.I. while serving as the only hope to save the people in the old prison.With this being a Michael Bay movie, expect high action from every direction from a spectacular chase sequence in the San Francisco to the bad guys shooting the good guys with high power machine guns and unexpected surprises with emotion. One of the main reasons the film works besides the action is the relationship between Connery and Cage where despite their character differences in the film, somehow they depend on one another to save each other in certain situations and seeing how there's trust.Overall, a very good action movie.",9,3,4,23 May 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Quentin Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction
","The Bride is back and ready to kick ass in this conclusion to the two part series that Quentin Tarantino has establish as a masterpiece. Uma Thurman returns as the bride that everybody left for dead, until she got her revenge by killing two of the five assassins (Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu) and the crazy 88's; now she is after Bill (David Carradine), his lovely assistant Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen in a larger role) and ready for her vengeance. What makes Kill Bill Vol.2 a better film than the original is not by the choreography action, but its dialog and getting to know the characters. During flashbacks with the Bride, we see her in training by Bill's former master, Pai Mai (Gordon Liu) in which he has not only taught Bill, but also his deadly one-eyed assassin for which it is explained how Elle lost her right eye. Pai hates Americans and thinks that women are lazy and futile; he trains and punishes The Bride, as he is proved wrong that there is a woman who can fight back. We also get a look back at the wedding in El Paso, Texas for which The Bride is pregnant and about to marry a hick who runs a local music shop and at the same time meets Bill for which we all know what happens next. The last scene between Bill and The Bride is a climatic scene for which I will never forget, as I was shocked to see how it ended. I'm sure you will feel the same way I do when you watch this film. Overall, this is Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction in which not only does the dialog take in effect, but also understanding the motives behind these characters makes it even better.",10,0,1,26 August 2005
Walk the Line," Outstanding biography with excellent performances
","The year was 2005 when Walk The Line had been released nationwide in the United States and in the time of Oscar season as well. The film is a biography about the ups and downs of country singer Johnny Cash which explores the path like musicians where fame gets in their head followed by the booze, drugs and women. Walk The Line, once released, was compared immediately to 2004's musical biopic 'Ray' dealing with Ray Charles and his rise to fortune and fame with moviegoers looking at similarities from pushy parents, death of a sibling, love rivalries, and the pain of the main protagonist. But somehow Walk The Line managed to get some information correct rather than feel sorry for the main characters, like in Ray where months after Mr. Charles passed away, a lot of fans of either the movie or the musician wanted to do their homework on what was real and fake where at least sixty percent of the film was just made up leaving only to care for Jamie Foxx's performance. Walk The Line surprised everyone once they were on their computers to check out whether or not what they were seeing on screen was true.The performances of the actors shined throughout this film. Joaquin Phoenix did a kick-ass job as the man in black where even his vocals seemed to made me jump after realizing that he sang all the Johnny Cash songs in the film, even the ones that didn't make the cut for the CD soundtrack. Reese Witherspoon is hotter than a pistol as June Carter, Johnny's interest, who shows her southern roots by playing the late musician with such energy and spark that she is the heart and soul of the movie. Robert Patrick (Terminator 2) gives the shivering performance of a parent I've seen on screen as Johnny's hard-ass father who still thinks Johnny should have died and not his eldest son and also ashamed at how his singing son turned out to be with booze, drugs, and fame. Ginnifer Goodwin portrays Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian, in which despite the fact that the real Vivian was supportive of Johnny, they turned her to be the somewhat rival in the film giving more space for the Johnny/June relationship, but shows how much of an actress she can be on screen with better roles coming to her in the future. Also look for musicians Waylon Payne (Waylon Jenning's godson) as Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Holiday as Carl Perkins, Jonathan Rice as Roy Orbison, Shooter Jennings (Waylon Jenning's son) as Waylon, and Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley.",10,0,0,20 May 2008
Alien 3," Doesn't succeed like its two predecessors
","While 'Alien' (1979) was the first film of the saga to make me fall in love with the Horror/Sci-Fi genre, people told me about the first sequel 'Aliens' (1986) and how amazing it was from the action and special effects. Somehow my classmate from middle school had to bring me Alien 3 in which he was too cheap to show me the first outstanding sequel.Grrr, I still hate him! Alien 3 takes place after the event of 'Aliens' where the remaining survivors crash land on another planet with Ripley being the lone survivor realizing she's at a prison. There are no guns, no axes, no kind of weapons for the guards to defend themselves. Sigourney Weaver plays the lone hero where she thinks that despite being a prisoner, all of her problems are gone where maybe none of the creatures would return...Yet...A face-hugger manages to hijack on the ship where Ripley is sleeping before going after its first victim and later creating the famous monster creature. The alien goes after the prisoners and guards in the detention center where Ripley must find a way for her and the survivors to take on the single beast.Alien 3 doesn't have the same thrills and drama as the first movie nor the horror and action of the first sequel where fans would go back and take a look at these marvelous scenes. There's not even a character to cheer for or admire unlike Aliens where people would say how much they'd admire Hudson, Hicks, Vazquez or any of the supporting characters besides Ripley.What a shame!",5,337,351,19 February 2008
The Incredible Hulk," Hulk Smash!!!
","After a five year absence from the big screen, Hulk is back with more punches and kicks to throw around than a thinking brain which would hurt more movie goers than cramming for a high school exam.I'll admit that I love Ang Lee's version of the ticked off monster in which it took its time getting to know the characters before getting to the action sequences along with seeing how experiments could have consequences. Plus the cut scenes which resembled a comic book had it's high marks though it can only please those who truly love the atmosphere of comic books. This time around French director Louis Leterrier brings more anger while managing to bring depth to the lost soul of Bruce Banner (Edward Norton).'The Incredible Hulk' is a reboot of the first movie (note: a third Hulk is in the works) in which it pays homage to the classic 1970's series with Edward Norton (taking over Eric Bana) playing the title character after a failed experiment left him to turn into the Hulk while hurting the love of his life Betty Ross (Liv Tyler taking over the Jennifer Connelly role) and becoming a fugitive as he hides in Brazil working in a soda factory. It's not long when Betty's father, the indestructible General 'Thunderbolt' Ross (William Hurt taking over for Sam Elliot), finds a report that an elderly man has drinking a piece of gamma radiation and immediately finds the location of Bruce where the general gets a British/Russian import soldier by the name of Blonsky (Tim Roth) to help track down Bruce.The action doesn't take much long before Bruce is bullied by a few thugs which leads him to turn into the Hulk smashing and throwing his enemies before going after the secret military. Bruce is now on the run as he wants to head back into the states to find the love of his life along with seeking a cure for his disease while Blonsky convinces his boss to give him the same radiation that made Bruce into the monster he is and having a one on one action.With the film under two hours, The Incredible Hulk is great entertainment and a way of apologizing to those who hated the first Hulk movie in which those who seek mile-a-minute thrill rides will be pleased. The film's got everything from a wild battles, wit humor and while the performances are not Oscar-memorable, I really cared for Norton as the title character where he wanted to rid his curse while remembering from 2003's Hulk that Eric Bana's version actually liked being angry. Liv Tyler, Tim Roth and William Hurt are good as well along with Tim Blake Nelson as Dr. Sterns.A note to all comic book historians or lovers, make sure to check out for Avenger references along with the last scene in the film when a certain character makes a cameo appearance.",9,8,11,7 December 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not a bad way to start the series
","This is the first of the three prequels dealing with the character of Anakin Skywalker (Luke's father) before he transforms into the famous Darth Vader we loved to hate and hate to love at the same time. This is also the first time we get to see the Jedi council before they were all wiped out in extinction, also a younger version of Yoda and a incomplete C-3PO.The original trilogy introduced special effects never done before on screen; but twenty years later, ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) improved what George Lucas wanted on his masterpiece trilogy. In 1999, now with technology being more advanced, Lucas, who now steps back in the director's chair has made a film not only of epic storytelling but of visual effects as well.The film starts out with a Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) who disguise themselves as ambassadors for Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) for which doesn't go well as a robot reveals their identities leaving the Jedi's no choice but to attack the droids. They find out that there's an invasion with the Gungan's, as one of them Jar Jar Binks becomes an aid for them.Jar Jar, I'll admit is one annoying character to which he only has screen time in this prequel and not in the other ones.The Jedi's rescue Queen Amidala and her people as they go to Tatooine after fighter pilots have attacked their ship. It is where they meet with a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) to which Qui-Gon believes he has the gift of the force within him. Anakin enters a pod race tournament where he wins, but after a dice with Watto the junk dealer, Anakin has to leave with Qui-Gon in order to get his training. At the same time, a sith apprentice name Darth Maul (Ray Park) is out there to kill the Queen and at the same time ready to extinct the Jedi.With the council disapproving the young boy, its up to Qui-Gon to train the boy, but dies in the hands of Darth Maul as Obi-Wan must teach the boy the ways of the Jedi.Star Wars: The Phantom Menace is just a cool film. It's not the best of the saga, but a fun film nonetheless where there are cool fight scenes along the way.",10,3,8,16 May 2005
Catch Me If You Can," The Great Escape Artist
","While it was easy for me to believe that Steven Spielberg could direct such pictures such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan or Minority Report where each of those films tackle subjects or showed realism of certain events, Catch Me If You Can surprised me as one of those films where for once he could show the other side of him without losing his touch.In 'Catch Me If You Can,' Leonardo DiCaprio is the central character for which he plays William Abagnale Jr., a young man who looks up to his father William Sr. (Christopher Walken) in which all the son observes is how to lie and B.S. people to getting what he wants. In one particular scene, William is at a public school dressed in his old private uniform outfit and fools a classroom in believing that he is a teacher and not just some puny student. The rise and fall from grace starts after William sees his father and mother getting a divorce which leads him to be like normal teenagers in running away from their parents and trying to use his father's wisdom in succeeding by fooling people, especially pretending to be a pilot for Pan Am Airports.After stealing nearly a million dollars in cash from pretending to be the pilot, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) is on the hunt to look for William in which on one occasion, he meets the young man face to face at a hotel in Florida and thinks he has him until he is coaxed by William pretending to be a secret agent.By using alias names from comic books, William is having different professions from a smoothing playboy, a doctor and a lawyer to get by making ends meet and at the same time falling in love with a girl by the name of Brenda (Amy Adams) who got kicked out by her parents after she got an abortion. Only time will come when young William will be caught and the truth will be revealed.Catch Me If You Can surprised me as a film about con artists and also a film about identity for which a person can surprise others in the way they present themselves and pretend to be something they are not. In a film with an all star cast from Leonardo DiCaprio proved that he is growing up and leaving all the teeny bop roles behind; Tom Hanks is a mixture of comic relief and drama for which he just wants to make sure that William Jr. is safely caught before getting killed just as Christopher Walken proves that despite playing eccentric characters or people on the brink of insanity, he can play anything smooth.",10,1,3,22 December 2007
Raiders of the Lost Ark," A film that can be seen over and over again
","Steven Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' plays something like an anthology series filled with adventure, dazzle, romance and thrills that it reminds me (forgive me, I'm excited) of the Nickelodeon show 'Are you afraid of the Dark?' where every Saturday night as a child, an episode would scare the hell out of people wanting more for next week. That's what Raiders of the Lost Ark does from the first minute we hear the crack whip knocking down a weapon.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a monument of 80's cinema where not only does Spielberg like to keep his audience riveted from his early days of 'Jaws' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' but introduces us a character filled with human emotions. And that character is Indiana Jones. The hero is an archaeologist professor where on his spare time he goes looking for artifacts out of the States and gets out beaten by his arch rival (played by Paul Freeman).In this epic before the two sequels launched, Indiana Jones finds out that the actual ten commandments exist somewhere in Cairo, Egypt where it's just a matter of time before his rival and his team of Nazi's get a hold of the artifacts and use it for Hitler's domain where if the leader opens the Lost Ark, he would be able to have God on his side and control the world. Before going to Egypt, Indiana meets up with an old flame, Marian (Karen Allen), who has the medallion that can lead everybody to the ark. After the first attack, Marian and Indiana become partners in search of the artifact.Raiders of the Lost Ark is not only an achievement in film, but in music as well. Steven Spielberg's music conductor John Williams puts the heart and soul of this movie using a mixture of thunderous and exciting adventure that it makes you want to rewind just to hear the music itself. I also laud the early special effects from the famous boulder ball chase to the climatic scene where even though most people would rather prefer the animals in Jurassic Park and today's technology, back then the people at least try to make some of the bad-ass special effects where they even won Oscars.The first movie stands as the heart and soul of adventure where later we would have inspirations from Tomb Raider to Relic Hunter.This is an 80's movie to treasure!",10,0,1,12 February 2008
United 93," Realistic, uplifting and honorable
","Everybody remembers what they did on that dreadful day on September the 11th, 2001. People woke up to go to work, teachers and students woke up to go to school; robbery, murder, lynchings and any other things both good and bad until four planes were hijacked and heading for four targets: The Pentagon, The Twin Towers and The White House. Three of the four hijacked planes reached their target destinations (Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon in Washington D.C.) in which everybody talks more about the Twin Towers as if they were history majors and forget about the rest.This movie tells about flight United 93 that didn't reach it's destination thanks to a group of people who stopped the terrorists before reaching their doom.'United 93' doesn't have any big top actors like Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Samuel L. Jackson or anybody we read in the magazines to influence in watching movies. The actors here look exactly like ordinary people we wouldn't even bother checking their acting credits; everybody plays the real life heroes in this movie.Paul Greengrass (The Bourne series) directs this movie where it's so realistic, it makes us feel as if we were there. The editing is realistic where it feels like an episode of '24' with different cameras showing points of view from the passengers in the doom flight to the traffic control towers to the military.This is the kind of film where you don't have to have an opinion (or express that you could've been there to be a hero) but to shut up and just honor those who at least did something with their lives.",10,2,4,16 March 2008
Minority Report," The Best Steven Spielberg movie ever made!
","2002 couldn't be a perfect year could it? 'Far From Heaven' depicted the stereotypes between interracial relationships to homosexuality in the 1950's which still happens today, to 'Bowling for Columbine' in which Michael Moore showed how Americans are fanatics towards having a gun; now in Steven Spielberg's latest film, he shows the more futuristic side towards people's mind: prediction.The main character in 'Minority Report' is John Atherton (Tom Cruise), a futurist cop who heads Pre-Crime, an organization dealing with people's fate on whether or not they are going to commit a crime. He organizes the operation after losing his son from an abductor six years ago in which his wife divorced him and now all he has left is his job and PCP he gets from a blind drug dealer.The way the cops read the future is by having three individuals floating on top of a pool with water and milk combined; the main head reader is Agatha (Samantha Morton) in which she sees the crime being committed while the two males repeat the incident.Now the question is, what would happen if you were targeted for a crime you were not even involved in? That is what happens to Atherton's character as he believes that he was set up by Danny Witward (Colin Farrell), a investigator for Washington D.C., in which he believed that everything has its flaws, including the whole pre-crime system.Nobody believes Atherton is innocent as he is on the run from the cops and the people of the city. In order to clear his name, John must go after the source behind the incident and set everything straight.'Minority Report' is a great movie, which is ten times better than A.I., and at the same time a very valuable lesson to anybody who wants to predict the future and realize that everything can't be true. As much as Roger Ebert hailed it as the best film of 2002, I hailed it as the best Steven Spielberg movie ever made.",10,2,4,21 June 2003
Training Day," A different Denzel for the better.
","Over the years Denzel Washington is known to playing either heroic leading characters or historic people (Malcolm X, Herman Boone), but now he gets to play the villain for the first time where I couldn't keep my eyes off of him when he first made his appearance as Alonzo Harris.'Training Day' is really about Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke in a different turn from Indie films), a trainee for the Los Angeles Narcotic Division where he wants to put away the bad guys just like all good cops are suppose to do until he meets Alonzo, a bad-ass happy trigger cop who knows everything about the city of Los Angeles from the Vatos, the druggies, the pimps, the cripples, the gang members who alert Alonzo, and so forth where he also speaks languages.Hoyt thinks that all he's doing with Alonzo is part of a routine...he's wrong about one thing.From one event to another Hoyt is either being dragged or coaxed by Alonzo from taking drugs, being part of a set-up after a murder where now he doesn't really know if being a narcotic officer is the line of work for him.'Training Day' is an insane ride where Denzel takes the screen like a madman tied to a bomb not knowing when he's going explode; he takes the term villain to a whole new level especially in cop corruption. Ethan Hawke is outstanding as the new rookie where other performances from Scott Glenn, Macy Gray, Dr. Dre, Tom Beranger, Peter Greene and Snoop Dogg shine out as well.",9,1,2,20 March 2008
The Big Lebowski," My highest thumbs up for an unothordox film.
","I first saw this film on showtime in 1999 and I got to say that this film was funnier and crazy than hell. The Dude(jeff bridges) is a stoner bum that people confused him for the BIG lebowski(David Huddlestone) because of the last name. So attackers beat the dude up and pee on his carpet. I won't describe the rest of the film, but the wife of the BIG lebowski is kidnapped and it is up to the DUDE to save her. Great cast, funny script, innovated humor. This film is the greatest comedy ever made.",10,0,1,25 July 2003
As Good as It Gets," The awakeining of the human spirit
","Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udall, a crudmugeon writer that is homophobic and has obessions complusive disorder. He has too eat food with plastic ware, sit on the same spot for breakfast, avoid walking on cracks from cement, and has to do everything five times(Wash hands, lock the door, five m&m jars, sets of paper and more). After his neighbor, Simon(greg kinnear) gets his ass kicked by a couple of guys, he must take care of his dog, verdall. All of a sudden, Melvin is rejoiced and happy again, seeing that somebody actually cared for him. Another person is Melvin's life is Carol, a waitress(played by Helen Hunt); the thing with her is that she feels like a prisoner because her son has been sick since the day he was born. She is on to him every 24-7 without even catching a break. The only person who wants her to be free is her mother(shelly winters in her breakout role ever). One day after recovering from an accident, Simon has to go to Boston in order to get money from his parents to pay the medical bills. That is when the three main characters(simon, melvin and carol) get together on an odyssey that not only get to talk, but also feel more spirited and alive. This is by far the best film that I've seen Jack Nicholson in since Batman and A few good men. I rank this film # 16 on my top 20 list of best movies.4 Star Rating.Go see this movie.",10,1,1,24 June 2003
Dawn of the Dead," Faithful to the original classic, but there's no need to bring 28 Days Later into this.
","George A. Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' back in 1978 was a masterpiece in horror cinema that not only did I say it is the best horror movie of it's kind, but I ranked it on my top ten list of best films of all time.Just like many movie studios, everybody wants to remake classic films to give them a little edge. Some of them worked from Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear (1991) to Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) where it was about different points of view and trying so hard to be faithful to their counterparts. Other remakes never fulfilled like Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998) where it felt like I was watching the film but in color with goofier content.Here in the remake of DOTD, Zack Synder, who would later direct 300, paces up to speed where after watching 28 Days Later...(2002), he wants his zombies in America to run faster compared to the slow and smart zombies in Romero's movies. The film starts with Ana (Sarah Polley) coming home from the late shift at a hospital where she falls to bed with her husband before seeing a little girl filled with blood in her mouth approaching the married couple where Ana's husband is attacked and turned into a wild and venomous monster within seconds and after her flesh. She flees her home and sees hell breaking out from car crashes, people begging to be safe from the creatures; some are even being devoured by the cannibals in front of her eyes. She meets up with survivors Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop with a shotgun; Andre (Mekhi Phifer) a thug who has his Russian pregnant wife; and then there's Michael (Jake Weber) a TV salesman. The five of them head for the mall where they noticed that they're not alone with three security guards and other people getting involved where they witness that an epidemic has hit the scale with people turning into these creatures. The mall is filled with ravenous zombies but not before they make their hideout their sweat haven.The film also makes references to the original masterpiece where the stores are named after actors from the 1978 movie to even cameo appearances from Ken Foree, Tom Savini and Scott Reinger.I liked the film. It was a little edgier and much, much more violent and graphic than the original. But somehow there wasn't much to think about when watching this movie except waiting to see who would die next.Bigger does not mean better in a remake.",7,0,0,24 February 2008
Alien: Resurrection," Better than Alien 3, but not the same
","Alien 3 was a survival movie without any weapons in a prison camp. I hated the film so much that I consider it the weakest of the saga. I couldn't even care for the Ellen Ripley character where even after her death, I was glad the film was over.Alien: Resurrection is the fourth film in the series where the writers figured out a way to bring back the Ellen Ripley character just so it can make more money and show more blood. In this saga, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is a clone lab rat where the doctors want to see what they can do to her after being resurrected. Not only is she a lab rat, but the doctors and scientist have managed to capture the aliens and the queen and test them like lab rats along with bringing the queen's eggs and experiment human guinea pigs.Other cast members include Winona Ryder as Annalee Call, a member of a mercenary team led by Michael Wincott where other supporting characters include Ron Pearlman as a hotshot gun-shooter who remains a likable for the fans to enjoy. Brad Dourif (the voice of Chucky) is a doctor who gets victim to one of the experiments; Dan Hedaya has a short role as a general while Leland Orser has the same psychotic energy he brought in Seven (1995).What saves this movie is the action and usage of guns compared to the survival and no weaponry of Alien 3. There is hardly any plot to care for, but then again it's not a perfect film. It tries at least to bring the spirit of the first two movies.",7,5,9,19 February 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A Wild Adventure!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was the surprise hit of 2006 in which I had never seen all of the first movie until i found out that the film broke Spider-Man's (2002) original box office record until a year later when the web-slinger would dominate the spot once again. I can see why people love 'Pirates' in which Johnny Depp plays the bumbling pirate Jack Sparrow who has escaped death in the beginning of the movie while being searched by Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom. Will wants to find Jack in telling him that the soldiers from the first movie have kidnapped Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and want to trade in a deal that if Jack gives himself up, Elizabeth could go free. More surprises come along the way with Jack wanting to find the heart of Davy Jones where William finds out that he has a father who is a slave to the monstrous beast. Meanwhile Elizabeth escapes her prison thanks with the help of her father where she searches for Will in the seas disguised as a pirate herself.While the special effects is the standout of the film giving most dead pirates and creatures life, the reason why Pirates of the Caribbean 2 works is because of Johnny Depp's charisma in this movie. I'll get a chance to see the first film but this film will stand out as a reason for me to love Jack Sparrow and the adventures.",10,0,1,29 January 2008
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A movie that took me by surprise.
","You have to thank the Harry Potter franchise for starting the fantasy- books-into-movie-transition-hype because ever since 2001 when the boy wizard made it's movie debut, other fantasy novels such as The Lord of the Rings decided to rule the movie box office where no longer did action movies pumped up with hardcore violence and blood or mindless plots grabbed audience members but literary heroes with good hearts.The Chronicals of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe tells the story of four children who go off to live with their eccentric uncle (Jim Broadbent) while World War II is breaking out all over Europe, including England where the children used to live. Lucy (Georgina Henley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmand (Skandar Keynes) and Peter (William Moseley) try to make the best out of living at their uncle's mansion where they are not allowed to make any kind of noise until one day when the kids are playing a game of hide and seek that young Lucy discovers that a coated closet takes her to another world of magical creatures including a half faun/man by the name of Mr. Tumnus (Scottish Actor James McAvoy) who is forbidden to make contact with humans along mentioning that The White Witch (Tilda Swinton) will punish those who break law in Narnia.The older kids don't believe Lucy until the following day they discover for themselves that their closet their younger sister hided one time leads them to Narnia where it seems strange to be talking to creatures who can talk back. They meet with Mr. Beaver and his wife where they tell the kids that they're meant to be heroes and save Narnia from the White Witch just before Edmund betrays them.(Note: I have never read the books just like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but I do follow with the characters and plot through Internet) I did wanted to see The Chronicals of Narnia back in theaters, but I was glad that I got to see the film on DVD where everything looks beautiful just like the film itself. Apart from the acting, I thought that each of the four child actors did a good job in convincing me that they could take charge when put into peril. Another thing about the film that took me by surprise was the voice credits from tough guys Ray Winstone (The Departed) doing the voice of Mr. Beaver along with Michael Madsen (Kill Bill) as Grimel, the head wolf of the White Witch. Liam Neeson is the voice of Aslen, protector of the creatures of Narnia which surprised me since he played both a hero and a villain that same year with him being the villain in Batman Begins and a good guy in this movie.This is a good movie to all ages!",10,1,3,10 April 2008
Spider-Man 2," ****! The Best Superhero Movie Ever!
","I know I'm over exaggerating, but this is the film that superhero fans have been waiting for. Spider-Man 2 balances itself as an action film; a horror flick; a special effects movie and a romance movie all in one wild ride.It's been two years since Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) became the hero Spider-Man; he's now in college at Empire State University studying physics, working at a pizzeria; and fighting crime at the same time. Yet, he can't balance everything, because with crime all over, he is fired from work, late for classes and gets fired back and forth by J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) at the Daily Bugle.What makes the character Peter Parker likable to 'Spiderman' fans is that he is more humanistic than Bruce Wayne or Clark Kent. In ways, Parker through the comics is shown growing up with problems of responsibility to being a superhero and a human being, even the scene where we see Parker's apartment reminds us that we're not alone. Even his relationships with his close ones aren't helping either; Parker's guardian Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) has doubts about her nephew and misses her husband after what had happened two years ago; his best friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) is head of special projects at OsCorp and is funding Peter's idol, Otto Octavius. Harry will always be there for Parker, but he hates Spider-Man after the death of his father (the son doesn't know), and the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is a model and an actress on Broadway who likes Peter Parker, but doesn't want to wait for him anymore to tell her 'I Love You' so she is going out with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson. What is interesting about Spider-Man 2 is that unlike the first movie where the supporting characters had brief roles, everybody is involved.The new villain this time is Parker's idol Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) whose experiment involves a fusion reaction that will save the city energy of electricity, and with the help of four tentacle mechanical arms that will control the reactor. Yet, his experiment turns out to be a disaster when he realize that his work is a magnetically reactor by bringing all metallic objects causing the fusion to grow even higher; he loses the inhibitor chip that controls his upper brain and is unstable until the operation scene, which in my opinion is a really scary scene and the most realistic I've ever seen (Note: this scene may scare kids). After panic in the streets, Jameson comes up with the name Doc Ock.People back and forth complained about the first Spider-Man movie, saying that the 1st hour was better, the 9/11 scene was obtuse, the action was horrible, and that Spider-Man is like an animated cartoon. But in Spider-Man 2, the glitch is fixed. There are no problems like that; even the special effects are better looking than the original. When I bought the film for my parents to watch, they said that the special effects looked more realistic, and you know what? They were right. Spider-Man looks like he has more weight when he is swinging back and forth and Doc Ock's tentacles steal the show in special effects. With a team of puppeteers (who are erased) and CGI, Doc Ock is one scary villain as the audience sees the tentacles move, as if they are characters of their own. Plus the fight scenes are incredible as Ock and Spider-Man go at it, leaving a shocking look on people's faces.The setback in Spider-Man 2 involves Peter Parker's choice of wanting to be the superhero saving the city or being an average citizen. In one scene after seeing Mary Jane with her boyfriend, he loses his ability to swing from a building and hold on to a wall as he realizes that he's losing his powers. Though he doesn't figure it out, he goes to a doctor and that's where his advice of having a choice takes place.There is one scene that is not subtle and that is when Mary Jane kisses her boyfriend upside down, letting audience know that she still remembers that kiss from Spider-Man (even my dad caught it).Sam Raimi has outdone himself in a project that he has desired all his life and unlike the first film, Spider-Man 2 is the best superhero movie out there. It outdoes the predecessor in all directions from minute one; with a few surprises along the way, the film is worth watching and nonetheless, more exciting.",10,0,0,1 July 2004
Batman Returns," Tim Burton's Best Work Ever!
","'Batman Returns' was my favorite film in high school as no matter what grade level I was in, it kept getting weirder. The more I thought about this film, it looked like a three way circus dealing with a hero torn apart, a freak show who wanted the majority popularity and a Cinderella story where the woman wanted a better life for herself. To most fans, 'Batman Returns' was a better adaptation of the comic book than the original, and you know what, they were right.The film's prologue takes place in 1962 of Gotham City where the Cobblepots couldn't be happier with the birth of their first child; yet to know that there son looked hideous like a burned kid going to school, the parents decide to get rid of their son by dumping him in the lake where it takes him to the sewers of Gotham City where thirty years later, the hideous son would grow up to be the mysterious Penguin.Gotham City is pretty quiet on Christmas Eve where no mouse would be stirring, and the deal on making a power plant in Gotham City from Max Schreck (Christopher Walken) is no laughing matter. What the mayor and everybody else don't know is that Max wants to take all of the surplus energy from the sources in Gotham City in order to keep the plant alive. During a speech in Gotham City's fairground, a group of clowns called The Red Triangle Circus Gang attack the citizens of Gotham as it is up to Batman and not the cops to handle it.After battling it out with The Joker and losing Vicky Vale, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) returns as the dark knight and dukes it out with the gang members as he saves Schreck's mousy secretary Selina Kyle (Michelle Phiffer) from getting killed. After the incident, Schreck gets kidnapped by some sewer thugs and take him to see the local crime boss The Penguin (Danny DeVito) as he tells Schreck that he wants to be a citizen of Gotham without anybody getting wise and to be loved as he bribes Schreck by showing him all the crap that he once destroyed. So the deal is made and Schreck needs to come up with a plan.Selina Kyle's life is never easy as her comes home from Schreck's Enterprise where from phone call after another, its another story. Until she gives herself a message that she has to file some paperwork for the Bruce Wayne meeting for Schreck's appointment. She discovers what Max is trying to do with the new plans for the power plant and is killed from Schreck as he throws her out the window. Street cats resurrect her as she wakes up dazed and fed up of the life she once lead and starts a new life, calling herself Catwoman.The Penguin's popularity in Gotham City is more than a jock or a hustler would have, as Batman wants to find out what angle the Penguin is getting at. Now with Schreck on the wing of a dragon, he gets The Penguin involved in politics where if the original mayor can't take his job anymore, then The Penguin would win leaving him and his gang of clowns to wreck havoc on Gotham City.During the film, Batman encounters The Penguin as he finds out the schemes he's trying to pull, not to mention the new female vigilante that has been all over Gotham newspapers. During a fight scene with the caped crusader, Catwoman has a thing for the man in black where like Spider-Man and the Black Cat, the new vixen wants to be in the bat's world. Sooner or later the two lovers find out each other's identity in a famous dance sequence where The Penguin crashes the party.I know there are some people out there that might not like 'Batman Returns' but you know what, that's okay. The film is much better in set designs, original score, even more erotic than the first film. Just like my days in high school, Batman Returns is a fun house with surprises coming from left and right and there's no stopping the madness.",Null,1,2,15 November 2003
Finding Nemo," Pixar has gone beyond our limits
","Pixar has made some of the enjoyable films in the past years: The Toy Story films, Monsters, Inc., and A Bug's Life to name a few. What makes these films interesting is the designs of the films as if they look identical to real life; now the creators have made underwater more realistic than ever in 'Finding Nemo' where the waves of the water seem to have life of its own.'Finding Nemo' is a story of a clown fish name Marlin (Albert Brooks) who takes on the responsibility of his young son Nemo after the mother and the babies were killed off screen. Now as a single parent, Marlin worries about everything that his young son does, even when he goes off to school for the first day.There is a universal moment in about every Pixar movie where there is always a human nature to relate towards the animated films; with Marlin's parental worries as a single father, most of the dads in the audiences can relate to him, especially when Nemo is kidnapped by a sea diver after getting near a boat.Marlin goes through the sea of Australia where he meets with a blue coral fish name Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who has STM (Short Term Memory) where she can remember things and than forget until the final moment. They go on adventures from escaping sharks, getting sting by jellyfish, swimming with turtles and going inside a whale's mouth.As for Nemo, he's inside a fish tank in a dentist office where he meets with characters that have been capture by the dentist; the leader of the pack is Gil (Willem Defoe of Spider-Man) who has been trying to free a bunch of sea-animals and with Nemo, they have a chance.'Finding Nemo' is funny and touching where like any other film, where audiences get to learn a lesson about letting go of their young ones as they go out into the world, but also have a good time.",10,1,2,11 May 2005
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," For an origin movie, it's pretty cool.
","After three X-Men installments featuring the popular Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman, Marvel Studios decided to give the raging animal a movie of his own on how the character came to be.Jackman plays the title character for the fourth time in the franchise as we witness the birth of Logan having claws at a young age along with his brother Victor Creed (a.k.a. Sabertooth), who has the same gift, and go through many wars where Victor enjoys the carnage of killing.Logan and Victor are picked up by Colonel Stryker (Danny Huston) in a special team for covert operations involving killing people; however Logan wants out and tries to lead a different life before many of his team members are killed off left and right like flies including those who are not like him. So now it's a race against time for Logan (Wolverine) to look for other mutants before they fall upon to Stryker's trap.Overall, for an origin, it's a cool movie. This is really the type of film where many fans already know how Wolverine came to life from the first films and the comics, but the action scenes will get to you since they're bad-ass. Hugh Jackman still kicks ass as Wolverine and brings the animal rage just like the three installments. Liev Schriber (Scream 2) is the breakout actor as Sabertooth and brings a certain fear and terror to give many fans chills. Look for other characters as Wade Wilson, Gambit, Cyclops, The Blob and many more.So, go enjoy X-Men Origins: Wolverine.",8,2,4,15 September 2009
That Thing You Do!," Classic movie with classic songs
","'That Thing You Do!' represents any music band's dream of having a successful career along with a song to take them to fame and rising to downfalls at the same time. The film is about a drummer name Guy Patterson (Tom Everett Scott) who works at his father's appliance store while his friends are out there having a good time in a rock band with no title to call themselves. Guy is needed for his gift after the band's drummer Chad (Giovanni Ribisi) breaks his arm where they perform their song 'That Thing You Do!' at a local high school gymnasium and become an instant hit. The band members include Jimmy (Jonathan Schaech), the lead vocals and lead guitarist, Lenny (the hilarious Steve Zahn), the second guitarists and vocals who happens to be the comic relief and smart-ass of the group, and T.B. Player (The Bass Player, played by Ethan Embry) where they have a groupie, Jimmy's girlfriend Faye (The lovely Liv Tyler). After being a success by singing their famous song through various places including a pizza parlor, the new band who call themselves The Wonders, find a manager where they go through a cheap gig before the big guns comes to the boys.Mr. White (played by Tom Hanks) replaces their formal manager and heads the band into a tour with other famous singers. From there the band gets to find out the ups and downs of being in a band where members decided to leave, girls get in the way along with some of them from home break up with them (ex. Guy's girlfriend leaves him for the dentist) and nobody wants to follow the rules.The film was directed by Tom Hanks where not only does he show what goes on in a band, but brings back the atmosphere of the 1960's where it feels like I'm watching a document about the American version of The Beatles. Plus, the soundtrack itself is hot! I'd still play the songs from the fictional band on my CD player, thinking to myself that they're only pretend and not real. Yet, the songs are a classic just like this movie. Now go put on some shades and watch this movie.",10,1,1,10 April 2008
The Mummy," A Wallop of Surprises
","The Mummy made its debut in 1999 as a updated version of the 1932 movie. Brendan Fraser stars as Rick O' Connell, a soldier of the legionare that decides to become a mercernary after a beautiful librarian name Eve(Rachel Weisz) and her bumbling brother Jonathan(John Hannah) release him from prison and tell him to get the treasure from Hamanaptra. I think that's how you spell it. None the less, as always, there's a bad guy in the movie, Imhotep(Arnold Vosloo) has been resurected by the dead from Eve and havoc is breaking loose all over egypt. With O'Connell's weasley friend Benny(Kevin J. O, Conner)leading a mercenary team, it is up to the two teams to escape the wrath of Imhotep and save the world before they die. The Mummy has great action, laughs, thrills and is one hell of a ride along the way.",10,0,0,16 April 2004
The Others," A scary, freaky and shocking horror film!
","There's no way in hell 'The Sixth Sense' will ever gain my approval as a modern horror movie since he forgot to mention people that he based it on a kid's show called 'Are you afraid of the dark?' with the episode being 'The Tale of the Dream Girl.' A month later in 1999, more ghost movies followed where there was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon proving to be more of an effective and original thriller. Other ghost movies followed but none will ever come close than 'The Others.' Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a widow to a soldier during the events of World War II who shelters two of her children, Anna and Nichols, in a mansion all by herself. Not only is she a fanatical Christian where she gives lectures and wants the children to remember certain things, but she doesn't allow the children to leave the house due to a skin disease they have. She hires help from Fionnula Flanagan who plays Bertha Mills, along with Eric Sykes (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and Elaine Cassidy to assist her. Grace soon discovers weird things going around in her mansion before asking the children if they been horse playing and the housekeepers if they've been touching things and moving objects around that weren't suppose to move.Suspicion turns to threats, threats lead to clues, and everything will be unravel sooner or later with a shocking ending.I'm not familiar with Alejandro Amenábar's work, but as soon as I say 'The Others,' all I have to say is that it's one hell of a movie beating the hell out of 'The Sixth Sense' with its amazing cast and its edge of your seat/heart pounding moments making it one of my favorite horror movies of all time.Like 'Alien,' don't you dare see this film alone or in the dark.",10,1,2,25 February 2008
Troy," Cool Movie!
","Unlike Van Helsing which was pointless and not a lot of fun. Troy on the other hand, I found it more superb. Not since Gladitor has there been a grand epic of action, realistic battle sequences and honor for these characters. Brad Pitt heads the all star cast as Achilles, a warrior that can never be stopped. The whole summary of the film is that Paris(played by Orlando Bloom) has had a secret affair with Helen(played by new comer Diane Kruger)that her King Menelaus played by Brendan Gleeson doesn't know about and during the sail to Troy, Paris's older brother Hector(played by Eric Bana) must protect his brother. With Menelaus in a rage, he tells the Greek King Agamemnon played by Brian Cox to sail to Troy and start a war. This movie is about honor and the cost of love.I would recommend this movie to any movie fan or to anybody who enjoyed classic epics from the Kirk Douglas film Spartacus, to Mel Gibson's Braveheart or Russell Crowe's Gladiator.",Null,1,3,14 May 2004
Brokeback Mountain," Such a sad but beautiful movie
","When I first heard about 'Brokeback Mountain' in 2005, there was buzz all over the place from critics and moviegoers alike who lauded the movie for being a risk taker while at the same time being the pun of jokes on comedy and late night talk shows because of the subject of having two gay cowboy lovers. My first reaction in watching the movie on HBO almost made me want to giggle in remembrance to the jokes, but it wasn't until five minutes later where I wasn't laughing anymore as I followed the story and kept my mouth shut.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work at a cattle ranch in the late 1960's where they have to take a flock of sheep from one part of the ranch to another without having too many or losing any of the creatures. From there they start a bond where one night the bond starts to deepen where Jack falls for Ennis but not before being pushed into sex which they agree to only do so in the tent and not say a word about it to anybody.Years later after the little stunt, Ennis and Jack go their separate lives where both of them are married to women and have families. Jack is working in a business that his wife's father owns while Ennis is working odd jobs just to make ends meet and still remember his pride as a man but nothing could stop them from falling for one another where they try secretly to meet with each other until realizing that their secret relation is damaging their lives and those that surround them.Ang Lee directs this movie where even though I'm familiar with some of his action works in 'Hulk' and 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' the film is what Roger Ebert said about most of Lee's films, including this one, that it's about misguided characters who deal with consequences.The performances are outstanding, especially by the two male leads (Ledger and Gyllenhaal) who prove that they could step outside the teen movies and show serious acting. The same goes for the female performances as well from Michelle Williams who plays Alma, Ennis's wife and Anna Hathaway, who breaks out of her Disney Princess Diaries shell, to play Gyllenhaal's wife Lureen Newsome.This film won't appeal to everybody, including those who were raised by moral ethics, but it proves that a non-American director and four former teenage actors can show what they have to make a great movie.",9,3,7,20 May 2008
X-Men," X-Men is X-cellent!
","Stan Lee's adaptation of the famous comic book series has come to life in bigger ways than ever imagine. Throughout the years, the X-Men, like any of the Marvel comics have touched people in a way that we recognized: Discrimination. As mutants, they are discriminated for who they are without people giving them a chance to live in society.The film starts in Poland of 1942, the beginning of the holocaust where as many of the Jews are being sentenced to live in concentration camps to die, a young boy by the name of Eric discovers that he can control metallic objects with his own hands as he tries to reunite with his parents but after years of being torture and escaping the holocaust, he grows up to be Magneto (an older Eric played by Ian McKellan) who wants to tell his old friend and rival Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that he wants to destroy mankind after what humanity has down to him and those of generations.Later on through the film fans are introduced through the following characters: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); Storm (Halle Berry); Cyclops (James Marsden); Jean Gray (Famke Janssen); Rogue (Anna Paquin); Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); Mystique (Rebecca Rojimn Stamos); and Todd (Ray Park).The film itself plays true to the comic book where mutants are fighting to survive in a world of prejudice and anger. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the head of Westchester Academy, a school for the gifted and talented, but a school for the young who have special mutant powers; from a girl who can walk through walls, a boy who can manipulate with fire, and another student who can turn objects into ice. His former students (Storm, Cyclops and Jean Gray) assist Professor Xavier in teaching those kids who can't afford to be taught by normal people. Professor Xavier also takes in a new student, Rogue (Paquin) who was abandoned and taken in by Wolverine (newcomer Hugh Jackman) who was attacked by one of Magneto's own mutant named Sabertooth (Mane). Yet, Xavier makes a promise to Wolverine that he will do whatever it can to find out what Magneto wants with him.Magneto (McKellan) has his own team called 'The Brotherhood' consisting of evil mutants (Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth) where he wants to kill all those who treated humanity evil, especially Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davidson) who wants to run the registration on mutants where they would be targeted down to death.The film itself is incredible, the cast is hot, and I was glad to see that somebody brought the idea of X-Men to live and with all of the actors being true to the characters.",10,0,0,21 June 2003
Spider-Man 3," Forget the critics!
","Spider-Man 3 returns after a three year absence with director Sam Raimi along with Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Rosemary Harris and James Franco returning with some new cast members along the way. Spider-Man is back with a new attitude this time!In the first Spider-Man movie it was all about Peter Parker (Maguire) donning the gift of fighting crime without anyone noticing; in Spider-Man 2 (The best of the trilogy), Peter Parker can't seem to balance himself as an ordinary guy making money along with being a crime-fighter for which he loses his powers and his truth is revealed to Mary Jane (Dunst) and Harry (Franco); in this installment Parker shows off to the public and at the same time dons another power: the symbiont for which in the comic book it gave Spider-Man more abilities than he ever imagined along with hurting those people he cares for along the way including Mary Jane.Like any superhero movie comes the villains. In this latest installment we have Flint Marko/The Sandman played with sympathy by Thomas Hayden Church after making an escape from prison to get money for his ailing daughter (Perla-Haney Jardine, Kill Bill 2) while duking it out with Spider-Man after being revealed to Capt. John Stacy (James Cromwell) that Flint killed Ben Parker. Topher Grace plays the desperate Eddie Brock Jr., who after being humiliated by Peter Parker in the office dons the gift of the symbiont where he becomes Venom towards the end. I'm not sure if Harry Osborn could be consider a villain despite that in the film he carries amnesia and doesn't remember who he is after trying to kill Spider-Man.While we still have all the old characters from the first two movies from Aunt May (played by Rosemary Harris with such little time), J. Jameson (the talented J.K. Simmons) and so forth, the only other character introduced in the film is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who falls in love with both Spider-Man after a rush with death.Does Spider-Man 3 promise to keep the audience entertained? You bet!Is it better than Spider-Man 1? Yes! The two sequels ARE better than the original.Is it better than part 2? No! Part 2 was its own movie with dazzling special effects, non-stop action sequences and more like the Empire Strikes Back with more drama and care for characters.Will i get my money's worth? YES! Like i said, forget the critics! Go out there and have a good time watching Spider-Man 3.",10,4,9,4 May 2007
The Terminator," The original is still the best one
","Don't get me wrong, I like T2, but it concentrates on more violence than the actually reason Terminator resurrected in the first place. The original Terminator had innovated special effects, a creepy story and a villain that will haunt most people for decades. This film is about a man name Resse that is sent back through time to save a woman named sarah conner after an assassin has killed many others because of the confusion name. The scenes are high explosive, especially the grand finale.The Terminator rocks all the way.",10,2,3,23 June 2003
Sleepy Hollow," A slice and dice feast!
","From Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands, and Batman Returns, director Tim Burton reinvents Washington Irving's 'Sleepy Hollow' into a rapid horror journey where no time is wasted after the credits roll into screen.Excuse the pun when I said roll, but heads will be rolling.After a series of murders in a small community in Sleepy Hollow, the people summon officer Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) to investigate the murders in the area where hopefully his eccentric techniques will help get the case solved. Along with way, Ichabod hears stories of a dead soldier by the name of Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken) with many of the townspeople (Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough, Richard Griffith) telling him that maybe the dead rider has come back to claim the heads of even more victims after his death. Ichabod befriends a fatherless boy while meeting with Katrina Van Tussel (Christina Ricci) who develops a small crush on the cop and does her best to aid him.'Sleepy Hollow' is not only a Tim Burton movie filled with various trademarks and eccentricities among the characters, but feels more alive with the visual effects and the background setting. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the hero where he portrays an early version of Captain Jack Sparrow before donning the pirate suit; Christina Ricci is a marvel as the damsel in distress, but the real hero is Tim Burton for making this great movie!",9,0,0,12 February 2008
Ocean's Twelve," Where's the plot?
","I'm a fan of the 2001 hit 'Ocean's Eleven' where it showed that a case of talented actors such as George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Bernie Mac, Scott Caan, Julia Roberts, Andy Garcia and others in the hands of Steven Soderbergh to make an awesome remake that's even better than the 1960's classic.I'm not sure if a sequel was really an addition.The film starts as Andy Garcia's character Terry Benedict, ticked off, wants his money back that Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his gang of misfits stole at the casino; he has his goons go after each of the individuals where they spent the money on luxuries from beach condos, wedding engagements, manicures, investments, and houses. Terry even goes far in planting a car bomb inside of Rusty's (Brad Pitt's) car without Rusty inside.The gang meets up where Terry wants them to pull a job in Europe to rob a rival as a way of paying the debt. Other characters involved in the story plot involves a detective played by Catherine Zeta Jones, who's Brad Pitt's love interest. Then there's Vincent Cassel (Derailed) as an international thief who's beaten more thieves to the punch in which he's up for a challenge when the Ocean squad arrives in Europe.Ocean's 12 isn't hip or cool unlike the 2001 classic where it manages to handle a plot very precise while having too many characters in the process; in which, every one of them were used in specific scenes. Here, it's all about the flashy outfits, the bright smiles and the cool scenery of Europe.In other words, I miss the dazzle of the first movie.",5,0,2,15 August 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Pretty Good Flick
","This is the end of the original Star Wars Trilogy before Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones, and the upcoming Revenge of the Sith, where all the people come together to fight the greatest battle of all: survival, not to mention the truth reveled that Vader is Luke's father. Though many people consider this the weakest of the trilogy, its still a fine journey where we get to see our favorite characters one more time.'Return of the Jedi' starts off with R2-D2 and C-3PO back in Tatooine where they head for Jabba the Hutt's lair. It's a plan from Luke Skywalker as a diversion in order to get Han Solo out of the carbonate where he is kept in secrecy. The droids are slaves to Jabba while Leia and Lando have disguised themselves as Jabba's henchmen as they pretend to turn in Chewbacca where Leia rescues Solo, but has become a slave to Jabba after being setup (not by Lando). Now Luke, who is a Jedi Knight goes to Jabba's lair where he tries to negotiate with the slimy creature, but falls into a trap where Luke battles a giant creature; like 'Empire' Luke defeats the monster where Jabba wants the Jedi, Chewy and Solo dead. Luke saves everybody and escapes Tatooine where they head back to rebel base.Before Luke goes back, he sees Yoda where the last great Jedi is ill and tells Luke that he cannot train him anymore as he must go off and defeat Darth Vader and the Emperor. He also tells him that Leia is his sister, where it's weird that she kissed him in 'Empire Strikes Back' which I thought at the time, they might be a great couple.With a team of rebel scouts, Lando Calrissen has taken the air with Han's Millennium Falcon as a leader where they must destroy the new Death Star; but Luke, Han, Leia, Chewy and the droids along with rebel scouts must destroy the shields inside the generator where troopers await to attack. They get help from furry creatures called Ewoks, who look like teddy bears, but can kick some serious butt. At the same time, many people consider this a weak point since the creatures looked to cute unlike the creatures we had seen in the first two movies where they were deadly and menacing.Along the way, Luke talks to Leia where he wants to tell her the truth but can't. Luke than meets up with Darth Vader where he takes Luke to meet The Emperor who created the man in black; also wants his son to help him destroy the planets. As they meet the Emperor, he wants Luke and Vader to fight each other to the death where one would take the position of the Emperor.While in Endor, Han Solo has feelings for Leia, but assumes that she is after Luke; and at the same time, everybody is captured by the Imperial as they try to get rid of the shields. The Ewoks help the humans and droids defeat the troopers as they bring down the shield generators.In a fight to the finish, Luke defeats his father, but at the same time is being attacked by the Emperor as Vader kills the Emperor, where both the son and the father leave the Death Star before they get blown up. With the shields down, Lando and the rebel pilots destroy the death star once again as this time; there won't be anymore evil to defeat. Luke burns the remains of his father as everybody else is celebrating.I love the Star Wars Trilogy, but I thought that the ending was weak compared to the first two where they were uplifting in drama and action. But with great action sequences and seeing all of the characters together again, Return of the Jedi proves to be a great conclusion to one of the greatest epics of all time.",10,0,1,16 May 2005
Scary Movie 2," Not even funny unlike the original.
","Here we go again ladies and gentlemen.When 'Scary Movie' came out in theaters in the late summer of 2000, audience members found themselves peeing in their pants as they laughed their butts off in some of the funniest scenes in a parody. The original movie was a parody of the film Scream along with every other popular horror movie both slasher/non-slasher. Some moments from the genitals to the pubic hair might have gagged some audience members, but no matter, the film itself was funny making Anna Faris a star before she would later appear in the entire Scary Movie series prior to making a serious cameo in Brokeback Mountain.Scary Movie 2 crossed out the 'No sequels' slogan since more movies needed to come.Keenan Ivory Waynes, director of the first movie of the franchise, returns in the director's chair where instead of slasher films, it's all about haunted houses and things that bump in the night as Cindy (Anna Faris) starts a new life in college where other members of the surviving party from Brenda (Regina Hall), Shorty (Marlon Waynes) and Ray (Shawn Waynes) go with her as well. This time Cindy has a boyfriend (Chris Masterson) where the two of them along with Brenda, Shorty, Ray and other guests are going to a haunted mansion for a field experiment to see about a ghost. Some parts of the film made me laugh from certain pop culture (Raging Bull, Nike Shoes) while some of the sex jokes just didn't work for me. I felt that I was watching a movie where the laughter needed to be forced out of me than seeing something innovated.",5,3,9,1 May 2008
Alien," A 1970's Landmark Horror Film!
","'In space, no one can hear you scream.' While Halloween was the sister to Psycho in slasher pictures, in 1979 director Ridley Scott made a motion picture of what it would be like to be somewhere where people wouldn't hear you screaming if you were being chase by an evil monster.'Alien' takes place in space where a group of miners led by Dallas, played by Tom Skerritt, land on a strange colony from another planet where they think that all would be normal until they discover that a group of eggs are laid on the floor with Kane (John Hurt) attacked by a spider-like creature before being knocked out for a while. Members of the crew include Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Lambert (Veronica Cartwright), Brett (Harry Dean Stanton), Ash (Ian Holm) and Parker (Yaphet Katto) where they want to know what kind of creature is on Kane's head before seeing a special surprise at the dinner table.Later in the film, a new monster takes place inside the spaceship where it goes after the crew members one by one leaving only a matter of time before everybody dies.'Alien' is a landscape in horror survival where it plays like a silent motion picture where we don't know what's going to happen next. It's creepy, very effective, and it's the kind of film you don't want to watch in the dark.",10,5,10,19 February 2008
Elf," I like to whisper too.
","this was a comedy delight, if not for december but for the holidays. Elf is about a giant human who works in santa's work shop as an elf after being taken accidently in santa's bag. Will Ferrall is really the reason to see this film, i admire his work since SNL and since than, he has done a great job of making everybody wet their pants. Anywho, the film doesn't really concentrate on your average holiday movie, its more of finding the ones you care about. In the case, Elf finds his estrange father (james cann) after leaving the north pole and wants his father to accept him the way he is.
Nice comedy, not to stupid or subtle.

Taxi Driver," I started to like Martin Scorsese after Gangs of New York
","because when I got obsessed with the director and his film Gangs of New York, I thought to myself, 'Why not see the rest of his other classics?' So I bought Taxi Driver on DVD and the film was terrific. What I really liked about the film itself was how it portray loneliness in the story. The entire film was about Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a vietnam soldier that has nowhere to go or nowhere to start, so he chooses his new life as a Taxi Driver. He hates what he sees on the streets, he wishes that all the scum and filth would be rid of. Martin Scorsese treats New York as one of his stars because he shows what went on in New York in the eyes of Travis Bickle. Travis meets a beautiful woman name Betsy played by the seductive Cybill Shepard. She is like the perfect chick that any guy would like to screw in bed, including Tom played nerdy by Albert Brooks. After seeing a porn flick, Betsy breaks up with Travis and that's where Travis loses his mind. He starts getting guns, and practices by trying to figure out who to kill. Travis befriends a twelve year old prostitue name Iris(a young Jodie Foster) for whom he wants to help her by getting rid of her pimp Sport(played by Harvey Keitel). I forgot to mention Peter Boyle's character as Wizard, he is the only character in the film that tries to help Travis before he goes off the brink of insanity. I liked Peter's performance.All in all, everybody should talk to lonely people or befriend them no matter how weird or goofy they are. I loved Robert De Niro's performance as the psycho that just lost control of himself. I love the fact that Robert pulled a stunt like that. The film is good, the acting is awesome, and the dialogue is perfect. Not to mention Bernard Herrmann's music, his final score.10/10A+",10,1,2,5 November 2003
Full Metal Jacket," The Best Vietnam movie since Platoon!
","The film 'Platoon' brought out the worst in those who believed in their country, not knowing what actually went on in Vietnam. To quote the character Chris 'We were suppose to fight the enemy, but we wounded up fighting each other.' As an admirer of Oliver Stone, he liked realism and truth; in Stanley Kubrick's war epic, he shows the insanity, racial bigotry and what goes on in the world of a solider in Vietnam.The narrator in 'Full Metal Jacket' is Joker (Matthew Modine) a recruit, who has been stationed to a boot camp in Paris Island, South Carolina, where things have be turned for the worse. There are three stories in Full Metal Jacket: the boot camp, the actually war, and the sniper.In the boot camp, we are introduced to Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) who scares off every recruit by calling them slurs, threatening them, nicknaming them based on personalities even punching them. We meet other soldiers other than Joker; we met a man from Texas nicknamed Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and a mental impaired solider named Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onifero) who is nicknamed 'Gomer Pyle' by Hartman. I remember the conversation I had with my World History teacher Mr. MacAulay and he explained why they choose Lawrence in the war, told me that the recruits didn't care about records or who were handicapped as long as they got a bunch of young American boys to be dead soldiers.Throughout the boot camp story, Hartman picks on Pvt. Pyle, as we all know that this kid shouldn't be fighting in the war but get special treatment as throughout the story, he is beaten up after screwing up on so many of the exercise and activities that go on. Later on, Pyle can't take it, as we all know that he is now suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder where his nervous system is about to break down. His anger gives him more strength to be more focus, as the drill sergeant is impressed that he is doing much better than the recruits, which leads Pyle to kill the drill instructor and himself.Joker has graduated from the boot camp where he is now a journalist at Vietnam getting all the inside stories and the graphic images. In one scene he is questioned about the peace symbol he wears on his helmet and is ordered to get it off before the marines discharge him. Joker sees Cowboy (Howard) now a squad leader, who tells him the crazy stories about the war, even taking a picture of a dead Vietnamese.Now we move onto the third story, the sniper. After the American soldiers have sex with a Vietnamese prostitute, they receive the wrong map as one by one, a solider is wounded where Cowboy would get shot. Joker and the remaining squad go after the sniper as we see the character change once he shoots the enemy. I feared that Joker will lose his sanity and will be like Lawrence (Pyle) where he turns against his squad. We may never know.'Full Metal Jacket' is one of the best films of the 80's that should have received more recognition, but 'Platoon' did come out first where it showed how American soldiers were unscrupulous, but what makes 'FMJ' a better movie is that it shows where insanity starts, at boot camp.",10,0,0,30 May 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," The Laughs keep on coming
","Though I slept on the couch throughout my life, I never really experienced sleeping in my own bed until I got older; and yet, I never figured out if monsters ever lived in my closet or better yet, wondered why there would be a monster in my closet? Monsters, Inc. is about a company in Monstorpolis City (hence the title) that has monsters to scare kids as a way of their energy of keeping the city alive. It's very amusing that they show the monsters in a room where they would have different doors leading to a room in different parts of the human world. The world's top scarer is James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) who is known to friends, family and fans as Sulley. His assistant is the little one-eyed green ball Mike Wasizoki (Billy Crystal) in which they are partners no matter what (like Shrek and Donkey). Sulley's competitor is Randall Wallace (no relation to the director and is voiced by Steve Buscemi) who will do anything to win and be number one.The rule that Monsters, Inc. has is not to get into contact or let a child touch them. In one scene during the big scream fest, a big blue monster screams out of a closet crying saying that the child wasn't scared and that it touched him. The other monster replies, 'She was only six!' When Randall tries to cheat in the competition while every monster is away, Sulley sees a door with flowers on it and opens the door. He hears someone messing with his tail and sees a little girl playing with it. Sully does not scare her, but he's reaction lead into a chase where this time it's the other way around; the little girl is chasing the monster. The city finds out that there's a little girl on the run and afraid that they'll get a disease from the child. Though the film is a buddy picture, the main characters are the little girl (Boo) and Sulley as he watches over her making sure that she doesn't get hurt. Most people would consider 'Shrek' a better cartoon because of its cruelness and ethnicity, but I also like 'Monsters, Inc.' because it's cute in a way of curiosity and realizing that monsters have lives too.",10,2,4,18 March 2005
Fargo," One of the top ten films of the 90's!
","The 90's couldn't get stranger could it? We had white people who wanted to put Ebonics in school testing, a Jew in office (Joe Libermann) who labeled violent video games to TV programs (TV-Y7, etc.), educated people who blew up a bomb in a building (Oklahoma bombing) and now a movie of strange proportions that not only have effective us, but brought new innovations to attacking people. 'Fargo' is a movie directed by the Coen Brothers, for which we know what their themes are in every movie: eccentricity.The film starts off with Jerry Lundergard (William H. Macy), a cheapskate car dealer who cannot give out a correct answer to everything he is doing, now he wants to fake a kidnapping of his wife in order to receive money from his father in law; so he hires two bumbling thieves (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife, while one of them tells him to ask money from the wife.So now the thieves are on their way to Fargo, North Dakota where after Jerry and his kid are gone, the thieves break into Jerry's home and kidnap his wife and going on a spree killing people left and right. The cop behind the case is Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) a pregnant wife who goes from city to city asking people about information and finding grizzly scenes after another.As much for acting in a Coen Brothers film, I admire everybody, but the one I cherish the most is Peter Stormare's character in the film, for which he is silent but deadly and the reason why Marge is after them in the first place, because of the mess his character made. This is not only one of the best films of the 90's, but another masterpiece from Ethan and Joel Coen.",10,0,0,24 May 2005

The Aviator," The way of the future is here!
","I don't know what drives Martin Scorsese to make biography pictures. Is it that he wanted to win an Academy Award before earning his first statute from The Departed? Is he really fascinated by these characters he's making about? To be honest, I don't know. But whenever I think of Martin Scorsese , I think about the techniques he uses in his movies from quick editing to fast-forward motion where I am just stunned to see how wild and brilliant Scorsese is.'The Aviator' deals with the ups and downs of Howard Hughes (played wonderfully by Leonardo DiCaprio) where not only does he want to make airplanes using the money from his oil tycoon business, but manages to change history as well. He gets involved with movie stars such as Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett as a marvel), Ava Gardner (the delicious Kate Beckensale), Jean Harlow (Gwen Stefani, making her film debut) and many other babes including a sixteen year old. While Howard is not only being a mesmerizing playboy and showing off his airplanes, he wants to make movies as well. He makes two of the most harrowing pictures of the early 1930's from 'Hell's Angels' and the original 'Scarface' where not only do people consider him a wacko because of the violence, but a genius at the same time.Just like every popular celebrity in town, there are a couple of enemies that want to slander and rid Hughes of any business. There's Pan-Am flight manager Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin) who wants to know the secrets to Howard's new airline plan TWA. Trippe has a sneak on board by Maine republican senator Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) who know the tricks in making Howard suffer.Throughout the film we get to see Howard's personal problems, and I'm not talking about girl issues, I'm talking about the obsessive compulsive disorder where it's one of the main sides of his downfall leaving everybody to wonder and how he'll succeed if this little disease keeps up with him. He's afraid of germs; he washes his hands more than once; he shuts his mouth tight if he can't get his words right. What a horrible feeling that must be.Other characters in the film include Noah Dietrich (the gifted John C. Reilly), who is an incompetent bag of hammers that is the fool to Hughes ' King Lear. Glenn Odekirk (Matt Ross) is Hughes' flight engineer who finds Howard's behavior a little strange. Professor Fitz (Ian Holm) is hired by the eccentric engineer to find out if the wind resistance is good or not.'The Aviator' may not suit everybody's expectations, but Scorsese never fails on bringing energy just like his other films. I think what made Scorsese make this movie was the fact that he was a fan of the atmosphere of the glamor of the 1930's where most of the movies he watched became his inspiration for making films.And somehow he gets to go back and make his dream come true in one of the most moving biopics I've ever seen.",10,2,3,25 February 2008

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Hands Down, the best special effects ever
","I wasn't at first interested in seeing this film until people convinced me that this film was wonderful; not to mention it took home a lot of awards, including MTV Best Movie. This is just like any ordinary story about good vs. evil and the sacrifices it challenges. Lord or the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is about an evil spirit resurrected and it is after a ring. This is like the fantasy version of Star Wars for which you have the following: Bilbo Baggins (Elijah Wood) similar to Luke Skywalker, wimpy and much of a crybaby; Gandalf the Gray (Ian McKellan) similar to Obi Wan Kenobi, very sage and confident; Aragon (Viggo Mortensan) very similar to Han Solo; keen, calm, and a kick-ass warrior. Other than that this is the best fantasy movie ever where its got the coolest special effects ever, a nice romance, great action sequences, a good plot to understand and follow, along with great characters. Need I say more?",10,1,2,23 June 2003
28 Weeks Later," Definitely worth seeing
","Not many horror sequels have what it takes to keep a franchise going without falling flat on their heads. The Nightmare on Elm Street series (with the exception of New Nightmare) were a total waste of time to film buffs. Friday the 13th was just a slice and dice gag. The Halloween sequels after part 2 were a waste (4 and 5 come in third place for trying).Yet, 28 Weeks Later is the first in many sequels where you don't want to leave your seat when the first noise is made.The film starts in the country side of London where a group of people are hiding in a cottage house before being invaded by a group of flesh eating monsters killing them off one by one as a lone survivor (Robert Caryle) manages to escape; heading off to downtown London where everything is quarantined thanks to the U.S. Special Forces keeping an eye on things where if the people are infected they must be shot immediately. After all hell breaks loose in the city of London, a group of survivors from two children, a nurse, and a gun sniper must do what they can to survive where this stylish sequel is more gruesome and meaner than '28 Days Later' and shows no mercy on the gore.Just remember this: It's just a movie.",8,0,1,13 October 2008
The Thing," Paranoia in Antarctica
","'Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's coming to get me!' Harvey Danger, Flagpole Sitta John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is a remake of the 1950's classic science fiction movie where in his updated version, paranoia has never gotten so creepy. After his 1978 movie 'Halloween' where horror pictures proved that evil will never die, Carpenter takes evil to a whole new game.Set in the Antarctica region where like 'Alien,' nobody would hear anybody scream, a group of researchers doing God-knows-what happen to stumble upon a Norwegian rifleman shooting at a dog where after the gunman is shot down, questions are being asked by the group including the no nonsense pilot R.J. MacReady (Kurt Russell) in which they see more what they bargain for.During the film after an attack scene involving an alien dog, the investigation group fears that something has hit them and will never get out. Paranoia leads to fear, fear leads to questioning and those seeking questions will finally have their answers.John Carpenter's The Thing is a 'don't turn off the lights' movie where even during it's time despite the fact that E.T. hogged all the credits, it proves to be a classic thriller from icky special effects to make you either scream or shield your mouth to scenes that you'll remember in your nightmares.",9,7,13,16 March 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Too much of the first sequel; Cameron's absence is a miss
","After Terminator 2: Judgment Day or T2 known to fans introduced computer generated imagery (CGI) effects to scare the living daylights out of people along with bringing character development, great chase sequences, a wicked villain (Robert Patrick as the T-1000), high octane action sequences and making Arnold's character The Terminator a new hero to everybody. And that was all thanks to James Cameron.In 2003, Jonathan Moss (U-571) brings back the hero from the dead along with bringing a new plot to the film. The film still involves John Conner (Nick Stahl) grown up after witnessing the events where he could've been killed by the T-1000. He's a homeless person living on the street where his only survival is his strength and eating off medicine at a local stray pound. His mother Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) is dead so the kid's got nobody else left.Now comes the villain in the movie. In the first movie Arnold played The Terminator going after Linda Hamilton and preventing her from having a son who would be the hero in the future; in T2 the villain was T-1000 killing anybody related to John Conner. Now the villain is not a man but a woman who goes by the name of T-X where her mission is to go after future military workers; she kills teenagers left and right from drive-thru restaurants to parties where her main target is Kate Brewster (Claire Danes) the daughter of a military general. Once Kate and John find out what's going on, they go out in hiding before The Terminator catches them and becomes their guardian.T3: Rise of the Machines is okay fun. The action sequences were the only reason to see this movie, but it feels empty without James Cameron directing the third installment of the series where in each of the movies he directed, something new is always introduced. It's just too much of a repeat to follow.",6,0,0,22 April 2008
U-571," Hokum Fun. No more, no less.
","U-571 was been depicted as a pro-American movie in which it wants to show that Americans are capable of doing everything, except finding a director who can find a history book and read it. In reality, America had nothing to do with finding the Enigma Coding Machine, but the British were the ones responsible for taking it away from the Germans.Besides the fact that this is nothing but a B.S. movie, I'd found it to be quite enjoyable without losing interest. I thought of U-571 as just another made up thriller to keep audience riveted from the first second we see the Universal Logo up on screen to seeing Matthew McConaughey and other actors like Harvey Keitel and Bill Paxton in action. It's really 'The Hunt for Red October' without the interest of knowing about submarines or history such as 'Das Boot' but instead having a good time.If you own this film on DVD, crank up the volume and enjoy.",7,2,5,15 February 2008
The Shining," Kubrick+Nicholson= A successful horror movie!
","Though Stephen King is proclaim the Master of Horror in literature, Stanley Kubrick uses everything to make his last movies from sexual fantasies, racial slurs, sadistic madmen and realistic behavior to mess with the human mind. Though 'Eyes Wide Shut' and 'Full Metal Jacket' were two of his last films, the third of his last movies 'The Shining' is a masterful movie of drama and straight execution of psychology to make you have nightmares.Jack Nicholson is Jack Torrance, a writer, teacher and a recovering alcoholic who has an arrangement to meet with managers at a hotel plantation in Colorado where for the next couple of days of his life, he's going to be the caretaker of the estate while starting up a novel. He takes his family, wife Wendy (played by Shelley Duvall) on the brink of insanity while smoking cigarettes and their little boy Danny (Danny Lloyd) who can read things with his mind and see things before they happen and shows expressions as if being abused. After packing and leaving to the resort they meet with the managers and cook Dick Halloran (Scatman Crothers) before the workers leave. Dick finds out that Danny can read minds where they both talk to each other afterwards and not to say anything about this to their parents.Days go by as Jack tries to write his novel but is distracted by everything from his wife's generosity of food to his son's interruption where things aren't what they seem as they live in the hotel longer. Strange things start occurring where Jack starts seeing people that didn't think existed or left the building. Noises are being heard across the hallways. Visions are toying with their minds. And Jack Nicholson starts to lose his mind.'The Shining' is a great accomplishment in horror movies where not since 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Halloween' has a scary movie takes its time to show characteristics rather than cut through the action. Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece is not going to leave anytime in our DVD collection or our minds.",10,1,2,29 January 2008
"I, Robot"," Possibly the best Will Smith movie of the new decade
","I'll admit that before the first decade of the new millennium is over, I haven't been a fan of any of Will Smith's movies since he was more of a nineties thing. While some of his action movies from Hancock, Men In Black II and Bad Boys II were rather dead to me and most audience members, he went a different pace in dramatic acting when doing 'Ali' and 'The Pursuit of Happiness' where he even got two Academy Award nominations.Here in I, Robot, he mixes drama and action in one hell of a thrill ride.The premise of 'I, Robot' deals with detective John Spooner (Will Smith) in the year 2035 where robots have pretty much taken over the world both personal and economically. They serve to aid the humans who can't help themselves, clean stuff for their loyal owners and at the same pace dominating work in terms of making cars to furniture. The idea of robots is a way for humans not to worry about anything where at the same time shows that maybe the droids will take over the world where in the future nobody will have jobs. All that changes when Detective Spooner is called to investigate the murder of an inventor (James Cromwell), who made the robots.The robots have laws to obey and one of them is not harming human beings in any way physical.Somehow Spooner is not sure when one of the robots is hiding in a technician's office from the scene of the crime. It becomes clear to him that even perfect systems such as the robots can have glitches too; a scene when the robot Sonny (the suspect) is interrogated by Spooner proves to the detective that something isn't right when trying to test the robot's emotions, something that the machines don't have. He'll do anything to prove that the robots aren't perfect, even if it means trying to get killed by the things themselves.'I, Robot' is one great thriller where like 'Minority Report', it challenges people to think about the upcoming events that might happen in the future. Even in this decade many machines are replacing human work where maybe there won't be any jobs for people to work. At the same time it shows how much Will Smith can do both action and drama at the same time.",9,0,1,5 September 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," There's nothing ashamed in being a virgin.
","People lose their virginity at certain ages; some lose them at a young age around middle school or high school like this girl I knew who got pregnant at fourteen while others wait until they go to college to experiment life. But if you're Andy Stitzer at age 40 and haven't had sex, it's nothing to be ashamed about.In Judd Apatow's comedy, Steve Carell plays the title character of the 40 Year Old Virgin as Andy Stitzer. He works at a Circuit City wannabe store where on his spare time he collects action figures and rides a bicycle to work along with other places instead of driving a car or picking up women for the matter. He's a nice guy but doesn't have to courage to come out of his shell; even the workers he associates with from David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogan), and Jay (Romany Malco) find him a bit disturbing thinking to a point where he might be a serial killer. It's not until Andy reveals at a poker game that he's been a virgin all his life due to the fact that he couldn't get it on with chicks during high school. The trio help Andy find women by taking him to bars and giving advice on how to pick up women. Their plans fail where women think of Andy as too odd while one of them throws up on him when getting a lift home. It all changes when Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener) at his workplace and helps her out in choosing a DVD player where sparks fly and maybe he'll have his opportunity to lose his virginity.The 40 Year Old Virgin is not only one of the funniest films I've seen, but it's also one of the those comedies where it doesn't really have to be offensive to the subject of sex or those who never had experience sex and want to try it out. I also love the Steve Carell character where he was believable to make me want to watch the rest of the film without having to walk out on a good-to-be-true comedy that's just a riot from start to finish.",10,2,5,20 April 2008

Spider-Man," A promising start that will soon get better
","I saw Spider-Man on May 5, 2002 and I got to say that I was surprised that director Sam Raimi did a good job transiting a popular comic book to the big screen. Not since Batman or Superman has there been a movie about a great comic book hero. Spider-Man tells the story of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a timid and shy student who is picked on and has feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't have the confidence to tell her how much he loves her; until one day when Peter and his classmates go to the New York laboratory. That is where Peter is bitten by a radio-active spider which weakens him for a while and all of a sudden he has super-strength within himself. How our hero starts out as Spider-Man is from the comics with his Uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson) droping off Peter at the library, but instead he decides to go behind his uncle's back and goes to fight at the wrestling for money. After a robbery, Peter has no choice but to go after the suspect and that is where he starts out as Spider-Man.Just like every movie there is a villain, and the bad guy is Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin(Willem Defoe) after an accident in the laboratory. Now Green Goblin wants to go after Spider-Man and hurt those along the way.Here are the pros and cons.Pros: Finally, Spider-Man gets to come to the big screen where Tobey Maguire does a wonderful job of playing the timid Peter Parker with those boyish looks. Kirsten Dunst is a marvel as the lady in distress where her chemistry with Maguire works as if they were meant to be together. Willem Dafoe is still creepy off his 'Shadow of the Vampire' persona as the Goblin where he manages to ham up more scenes than Nicholson's Joker.Cons: The first hour works fine with the human effects until the second hour where the special effects dominates of not caring for a plot or any of the other characters. Most of the action sequences from a far away shot looks fake as if there's no weight or dimension. Not even the supporting characters have much screen time where it just leaves Maguire and Dafoe.Overall, a pretty decent film. Spider-Man proves to be a worthy comic book movie for fans of the books or the hero.The film also stars James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson.",9,0,0,5 July 2003
Collateral," A wild ride!
","Life couldn't get any easier for Max (Jamie Foxx) as night after night he drives a cab and can't get his dream of owning a limo business, but his night is about to become even worse 'Collateral' starts off slow with Tom Cruise's character Vincent walking with a luggage from an airport with his frosted hair, dark shades and a silver suit as a man trips over him, Vincent tells him 'Are you alright?' With just his look, he means business. Also in the beginning, Max drives a workaholic lawyer named Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith) for whom he tells her if he takes Annie to her firm in time, then she doesn't have to pay the fare. He wins the bet, but she exchanges her phone number while Max gives her his lucky postcard to remind her of relaxation.After that, the thrill ride begins as Vincent goes into the cab and offers Max six-hundred dollars to take him for an all night ride in which case becomes a killing spree. In a comic relief, Vincent tells Max 'This is the cleanest cab I've ever seen.' Not for long.In the film, Vincent is working for a mafia crime boss for which he must assassinate five different people (a drug dealer, a jazz player, a business man, a Chinese millionaire and a lawyer) who are witnesses from his boss's case. And throughout the night, he goes on a killing spree shocking Max for his dear life; but Vincent doesn't want any witnesses so Max becomes his hostage that entire night and doing exactly what he tells him. Especially when Max's mom is in the hospital, Vincent tries to be boy charming by buying her flowers and letting the nurses keep the change; even finding the truth that Max has been lying to her.What's interesting about the character Vincent is that though he's a killer, he is more of an aid towards Max as he tries to get for him be more confident towards the dispatcher on the radio (his boss) who has been treating him like dirt; not to mention be more aggressive as Max pretends to be Vincent when seeing the boss that Vincent works for.Though I've only seen one Michael Mann film (Heat), what I really like about this movie is that he shows the entire city of Los Angeles at night; the atmosphere is very realistic it is, as if we've become characters in it.'Collateral' is a scary ride from minute one where the suspense never ends, not to mention the performances from Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise for which is kind of weird since Foxx is a comedian ('In Living Color', Booty Call) and Cruise has always played the hero (Mission: Impossible, The Last Samurai); this is a match made in heaven.",10,0,1,13 May 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Much better than the first two movies combined
","Harry Potter is back and this time it's more enjoyable than the first two movies. To be honest here, I actually like this movie. I was never a fan of the first two movies because they concentrated on bringing eye gawky teenage girls than actually caring for a story, but the special effects and John Williams' music made things up for me. All the principal actors from the first two movies return; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are back as Harry, Hermione, and Ron in which the story behind the Prisoner of Azkaban is that a killer name Sirus Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the prison of Azkaban in which he is after Harry Potter and wants to kill him. Harry isn't scared, as he is ready to kill the murderer who is after him. With an all-star cast featuring Emma Thompson as a teacher and Michael Gambon replacing the late Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledor, the acting is superb in which not only the three main actors have matured, and the special effects and John Williams' music are ten times better than the first two.If you enjoyed the first two movies, that's fine. But I recommend this for fans and non-fans alike to see this movie.",10,7,13,26 July 2005
Aliens," One of the top 1980's horror film ever made; not to mention a grand sequel
","'Aliens' is by far a more superior sequel than any other film franchise in history. This time, Sigourney Weaver is back to kick some alien butt in a mean way. After being cryogenic frozen for the past 33 years, Ellen Ripley(Weaver) has been risen back and being investigated after the incident aboard the previously ship she was in, which she describes that her crew died because of a grown parasite. Ripley also discovers the company that built the ship her crew died in has a factory in the colony of LV-426 of which people work and live in that facility. With not much time, the creatures attack the colony killing off everybody but a little girl name Newt (Carrie Henn). Ripley is sent to a military base in outer space where she is armed with heavy commandos carrying heavy firearms with the latest in technology. The team is lead by Sgt. Apone (Al Matthews) and Corp. Hicks (Michael Biehn) in which they must investigate the incident at LV-426 and see what has happened...that is where the fun begins as the aliens come out of nowhere and attack the marines.With whatever marines are left, it is up to Ripley and the squad to fight the aliens once and for all before they become extinct from the human race. Directed by James Cameron who directed 'The Terminator' delivers everything you want in a action movie.

The Fast and the Furious," An action movie with a some-what plot, hot babes, fast cars, great action and a meet-expectations.
","The Fast and the Furious is probably the first movie to get me into cars while at the same time enjoying myself without having to worry about a plot.Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner, a hot shot police officer, who goes undercover as a car junkie Brian Spilner to see if a local street racer/mechanic by the name of Dominic Toretto (Vin Diseal) has anything to do with hijacking a bunch of cargo from DVD's, TV's, entertainment sets, and so forth while at the same time falling head over heels for Dominic's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster). Brian comes so close while at the same time gaining trust to the target (Dominic) itself where it's only a matter of time before the truth comes out.The film itself has the best action sequences involving street racing and high octane action where despite a so-so plot to follow, or one that's been seen before (such as Point Break), you don't have to worry about a thing. It's just pure fun.The film also stars Michelle Rodriguez (S.W.A.T.) as Dominic's girlfriend, Letty; Ted Levine (The Silence of the Lambs) as Sgt. Tanner, and singer Ja Rule in a small cameo as a contestant against Dominic.",7,31,46,1 May 2008
Ocean's Eleven," Clooney and the gang in one great heist
","Ocean's Eleven premiered when I was a senior in high school, and I got to say that the film is excellent in every way making it one of the best films of 2001. George Clooney plays Danny Ocean, out on parole and decides to lead a heist on three Las Vegas casinos owned by Terry Benedict(Andy Garcia). He hires Rusty (Brad Pitt), Basher (Don Cheadle), Frank Catton (Bernie Mac), Linus (Matt Damon) and others to help out with the heist. As much as splitting 160 million dollars in 11 way was a problem, there is another problem along the way: Tess, played by Julia Roberts, happens to be dating Terry Benedict. Taking money from the person he's robbing is one thing, now Danny is after Tess as well. What really excites me about Ocean's 11 is that it is the type of movie that never lets the audience down. It's funny, dramatic and none the less, thrilling. The actors are pitched perfect, the dialog is sharp and every scene in the film never gets out of your mind.",10,0,0,26 December 2004
Spirited Away," The coolest animated film to come to life from Japan
","I first bought the film after winning best animated film at the Academy Awards. I loved how this film was mature and wasn't just your average Disney flick. I've heard both the Japanese and the English version and the film is cool. Its about a apathy girl name Chirio that has to save her parents before they turn into pigs. The film has wonderful magic, i even got my 4 year old niece to watch it and its magical.",10,0,1,5 November 2003
Pearl Harbor," Somebody drop a bomb on this movie!
","I mean that literary when I say that Pearl Harbor is one of the worst war movies I've ever experienced despite a promising trailer where I would think some history could be stuck in my mind. What we end up is a schlock of a film that endures romance more than a lesson.If there's a title that Ben Affleck should earn, it's 'Why am i the sidekick that never catches a break?' since pointing him in a action movie or any movie with him in the top billing without the aid of good actor Matt Damon always fails in the end. He plays Rafe, a daredevil pilot who is best friends with Danny (Josh Hartnett) where they enter the air force together before they separate after Rafe is called into action by the British Air Force leaving his friend along with hot nurse Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) behind. The story then concentrates on Danny trying to comfort Nurse Johnson after reading a telegram stating that Rafe has died in battle where he falls in love with the nurse until seeing that his best friend has risen from the dead.The real action doesn't take place until at least seventy minutes when the Japanese planes start attacking the ships at Pearl Harbor leaving some of the most memorable scenes in movie history despite the fact that this film is deemed as a chick flick.Overall, a real extreme disappointment for those that were going to see a great war epic. Even the talent here is a waste with too many actors from Affleck, Hartnett, Beckinsale, Alec Baldwin, Jon Voight, Dan Aykroyd, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jamie King, Jennifer Garner, Ewan Bremmer, Mako, Tom Sizemore, William Fitchner, Sara Rue, and many more good names that deserved better than this.",5,5,9,17 February 2008
Enchanted," Amy Adams will enchant your heart.
","I've had little expectations about the film 'Enchanted' since I'm not one to follow the Disney princesses from Jasmine of Aladdin, Ariel of the Little Mermaid or Belle from Beauty and the Beast. But when I bought the film on DVD after hearing numerous people saying how wonderful it was prior to being a box office hit, I just knew this was going to be a delight.The film starts in animation form where the animals and trees sing while Princess Giselle waits for true love from Prince Edward before meeting with his mother (the wicked queen) where she kicks her into a well that takes her into another part of the world.The other world is none other than New York City, the city that never sleeps, where Giselle (Amy Adams in human form) is wandering in the streets all alone dressed in a white wedding gown and is not used to the mean and dangerous world compared to the sweet enchanted life. She confuses a short man for a dwarf while a homeless man steals her tiara leaving the princess all alone. It isn't until she's spotted by lawyer Robert Philips (Patrick Dempsey) and his daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey) where they have no idea what she's doing on a billboard. Morgan considers her a princess while Robert thinks that she's just lost and needs to go home.It isn't until the next day where things start to get a little strange for Robert where he starts seeing dancing cockroaches and birds while Giselle is singing her way in his home like a fairy tale.Meanwhile Prince Edward (James Marsden) is in human form where he takes his companion Pip, a talking chipmunk, and his faithful servant Nathaniel (Timothy Spall) to find Giselle just as The Wicked Queen, Narissa, played wickedly by Susan Surandon, wants Giselle dead and wants Nathaniel to finish the job.While this is a Disney film aimed mostly at 5 to 12 year old girls, as a grown male I was impressed to see that this film was enchanted with delight. But the real reason to see this film is none other than good girl Amy Adams who plays the character of Giselle so blithe and wonderful that not only will she be another princess in the Disney lineup, but she's someone that we wish we could have in the real world who only wants people to be happy.",8,2,2,1 May 2008
Alien vs. Predator," Good idea at the time, but now it's just...
","I don't know how to describe Alien Vs. Predator since these two film franchise monsters have been haunting people's dreams and inspiring film makers to make replicas ever since. With two bad-ass Alien films and one Predator movie under the belt as the best action/sci-fi films to fans, somehow a suggestion of colliding these two monsters would be a good idea back in the nineties. There were video games in the arcade, computers and game systems with marines fighting the two creatures along with action figures that I used to see from Toys R' Us and Kaybee's. Somehow the idea of Alien Vs. Predator was just another way to make money where somehow it would take forever to make a film until 2004 where I had better things to do and better movies to watch.Here's the synopsis: An expedition team goes to Antarctica to find something where some of the crew members are disappearing and getting killed by various creatures. It's only a matter of time before the human species is wiped out leaving the Aliens and the Predators to duke it out for survival of the fittest.The actors in the movie involve Sanaa Lathan (Something New), Ewan Bremmer (Pearl Harbor) showing off his Scottish accent and Lance Henriksen reprising his role as Bishop in human form.",5,0,0,27 May 2008
No Country for Old Men," A spellbinding masterpiece!
","There have been words described by critics about this movie that seemed to fit the profile: 'Masterful!' Gene Shalit, Today Show; 'Hypnotic!' Richard Schickel, Time Magazine; 'Flawless!' Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times and so many words that I can't give a list.If the Coen Brothers were to have a class lesson, it would be 'How To Murder 101' ever since the 1980's when they started on Blood Simple (1984) before their 90's flick Fargo (1996) where killing people with a wood chipper became an innovated technique; now, in this decade, 'No Country For Old Blood' is a nightmarish masterpiece where your nerves will get the best of it. It's the Coen's Trifecta of murder films!'No Country For Old Men' is not only the title of the film, but a metaphor meaning that if you don't have the balls to take responsible for your actions, then you don't belong in your country. Josh Brolin, who has grown up since his Goonies days, plays Llewelyn Moss, an Ex-Vietnam vet who's a bum living in the country side of Texas with his wife (Scottish actress Kelly McDonald) where anything could happen until Llewelyn happens to be hunting and sees a group of dead bodies before finding a satchel of money near of two million dollars. In another part of town, Anton Chigurh (Academy Award Winner Javier Bardem in the most freakish role) is on the manhunt killing people left and right where he's looking for the two million dollars. His presence is somewhere between Michael Myers of Halloween to Freddy Krugger where no matter what, this killing machine can't be stopped. His weapon of choices are a silenced shotgun with a cattle gun to open doors and pop heads. After the numerous killings and the connection found, Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is on the case where he doesn't think that retirement will come anytime soon while hoping he can catch Moss before anybody kills him.The film has top notch acting from all of its cast both main and supportive. Tommy Lee Jones is fine as Tom Bell, Josh Brolin is outstanding as Moss; but the true standout of this masterpiece is Javier Bardam's award winning performance as Anton Chigurh where once you see his face for the first time and see him in later scenes in either a calm state or his character in a violent rage, your heart will start pounding while feeling more than just a little terrified at the same time. The rest of the cast includes Kelly McDonald hiding her Scottish accent to a Texas voice and Woody Harrelson as a hit-man hired by Stephan Root to catch the psychopathic killer.It's truly spellbinding!",10,2,7,11 March 2008
Remember the Titans," Disney + Sports Movies= Success!
","'Remember the Titans' came out in the fall of 2000 where it was a slum year in movies until this inspiration movie about an integrated football team dealing with the odds became a sleeper hit.While I'm not a fan of 'inspirational' movies that deal with certain attributes like 'believing in your gifts,' where there's some kind of conflict to follow like the theme's movie of racism or other biography movies dealing with certain emotions from poverty, out of luck, etc., but somehow without Remember the Titans we wouldn't have all these other movies from Disney popping out of Mickey Mouse's gloves from The Rookie (2002), Miracle (2004), The Greatest Game Ever Played (2005), Glory Road and Invincible (2006) with many other films come to follow.There are two things that make Remember the Titans work for me. One, Denzel Washington as Coach Herman Boone. I've been a fan of Denzel Washington since forever and I know that no matter if he's playing fictional characters or historical characters (Malcolm X, Glory, American Gangster; all three are the best), he can carry the screen and have your attention. The second thing that makes the film work is the soundtrack from Marvin Gaye to The Temptations where it gives the mood on what's going on with the characters through the good and bad times.Cool movie.",8,1,2,16 March 2008
Batman Begins," Batman has ressurcted at last!
","I had lauded on my review of Batman: Mask of the Phantasm as the best Batman movie ever made; well, Batman Begins is the better movie of the entire franchise. Ever since the franchise became popular with the 1960's show and spin-movie, including the Tim Burton version in 1989, fans and critics alike (especially Roger Ebert) had complained that the films (including the crappy Batman & Robin) had no relations of the Bruce Wayne character and how he started out as the caped crusader. Now with director Christopher Nolan (Memento) taking charge, Batman has been brought back to life darker, meaner and full of energy than the last other films.The prologue of the film has millionaire Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) in a Chinese prison camp where in his cell, he has flashbacks about the fear of bats he had when he was a little boy, including the flashbacks of when his parents were alive and the incident of their death taking place, and the aftermath of meeting with local crime boss Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson). After getting in a fight with Chinese prisoners, Bruce is taking into a dark cell where a mysterious stranger name Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) wants to take Bruce under his wing and train him by a group called The League of Shadows, a ninja organization where they don't leave their enemies to suffer, but to execute them. The team is lead by Ra Al Ghul (Ken Watanbe of 'The Last Samurai') in which after Ducard has given extensive training to Bruce Wayne, including letting go of the fear he once had. It's ironic that Liam Neeson is playing another character that trained an apprentice. In Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, he trained a young padawan (Obi-Wan Kenobi) to protect the innocent and fight evil.Now Bruce must go for the final test: the execution of a prisoner. Bruce joined the organization to help others and punish those who harmed, not to kill. Ghul reveals that he wants to murder everybody in Gotham City, so now Bruce destroys the lair of Ra Al Ghul's as he calls his butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) to have a plane ready for standby.It has been seven years since Bruce Wayne has left Gotham City; the city is in druid than it was before as more of the homeless people have turned into criminals with Carmine Falcone running the upper strength of Gotham, the other half belongs to criminal psychologist Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) who has most of his cronies in Arkham Asylum, an institute for the insane as he commits all of his thugs to Arkham. The only person who finds it all a hoax is district attorney Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) in which she wants to find out about Crane's plans.Wayne Enterprises is in control by a ruthless businessman (Rutger Hauer), in which after Bruce Wayne arrives, he gives Bruce a job working in the science lab downstairs with loner Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). The lab is underground where Lucius has the gadgets that even the military won't take in to protect soldiers. Lucius becomes an aid to Bruce as he knows from the millionaire is that he just wants to fight crime and protect the innocent. Lucius gives Bruce about everything from his lab, from a jumpsuit to a car that has more protection than a hummer itself. In one scene, Bruce asks Fox, 'Does it come in black?' and he does have one.Before Bruce puts the suit together to fight crime for the first time, he goes to the lair he once fell in a cave of bats and makes it his underground lair for Batman.There are no such things as good guys in Gotham City, as the only two remaining people who try to maintain a presence of good is Rachel Dawes and Sgt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), in which everybody else on the force is corrupted and working for Carmine Falcone, as Batman makes his first appearance in a Gotham warehouse where he takes down Falcone's thugs as a shipment of drugs has been delivered in the city. Batman takes down the thugs one by one as he knocks out Falcone and leaving him tied to a signal.During a scene between Crane and Falcone, we discover an alter ego of Crane as he puts on a mask and sprays toxic chemicals on people's face, calling himself The Scarecrow where he frightens his patients, leaving them to be insane. The plot behind the Scarecrow is that he wants to drug the water supply of Gotham City, which will leave everybody in the city insane killing one another, as the young D.A. finds out that what Crane is doing is illegal she becomes a victim of his scheme as Batman rescues her and gives the Scarecrow a taste of his own medicine.Yes, I reveal a lot of what happened in the film. But can I go on? Just because I gave you a lot, doesn't mean I going to tell you everything. You must see the film for yourself, as it is a grand spectacular from minute one to the end.I admire the first two live action movies directed by Tim Burton in which we saw the murkier side to Gotham City, but not enough of Bruce Wayne; and as much as I admire Batman: Mask of the Phantasm as the best Batman movie, Batman Begins was the ride we had all been waiting for.",10,0,1,17 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," A great war epic!
","September 18, 1998 (The day i saw this movie) Throughout the years,there have been war movies that brought back horrendous memories to veterans who fought in war; to movie buffs it showed how war can tear up an individual or showed why it was worth fighting for. In Steven Spielberg's war drama, it is not a division between what's good and bad, but to show homage to those who fought in the biggest war of the 20th century.The first 20 minutes of the prologue is one of the most gruesome battle scenes I've ever watched on screen. We see the boats boarding up soldiers as they are heading to the murky beaches of Normandy June 6, 1942, which will be remember to most people as the worst battle in history. Tom Hanks plays Capt. John Miller, who leads his squad in the terror battle and tries to find his team into the breach as hundreds of soldiers die. As realistic as it is, we see the carnage of soldiers getting ripped in pieces, crying for their mothers, and in one scene we see a man looking for his amputated arm.After the grizzly attack on the beach, Miller has been ordered another mission; a manhunt for the lost of one soldier after losing three of his brothers at Normandy, and throughout the film we get to see some of the most realistic battles since 'Platoon,' where the violence and gore plays an important part of the realism; but also get a chance to see to recognize the characters during the non-violent parts which reminded audiences members of how these soldiers were like a family.'Saving Private Ryan' is one of the best war flicks I have ever seen on the screen. With a great all star cast from Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Matt Damon, Vin Diseal, Barry Pepper, Giovanni Rebisi, Paul Giamatti and more. This is one of Steven Spielberg's greatest work ever made",10,2,4,27 December 2007
The Pianist," Adrian Brody's brilliant performance and Roman Polanski's direction help makes this a masterpiece
","The year was 2003 when I fell in love with the Academy Award movies in which instead of watching mindless movies from XXX with Vin Diseal or The Scorpion King with The Rock, I started watching movies that were nominated for Academy Awards no matter what the award was. 2002 was a year of memorable movies from Chicago and it's razzle dazzle to Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York showing how violent America was during the early years of the mafia. But no movie has touched me more deeply and profound than Roman Polanski's look at the holocaust in 'The Pianist' in which the director himself was a victim of the tragic event before escaping into hiding.Adrian Brody plays real life pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman who is force to move out of the apartment complexes with his family and into a small community after Hitler announces that certain parts of the country will be divided for those who are Jewish and those who are not. Wladyslaw and his family see the horrors that go on from soldiers forcing people to dance in the streets, homeless Jews fighting people for food; even at night when Nazi soldiers break into people's houses to execute Jews for no apparent reason. The scenes are so real that I gasped at first sight.After Wladyslaw and his family are moved into concentration camps to work in enslavement, he leaves where he's like a mouse hiding from building to building in avoiding the cats to get him. Years go by for the famous pianist in which the horrors are continuing in the streets for which there are a few people not afraid to die trying in the fight.The film is mainly a survival for the pianist, but the film's portrayal of what went on outside the concentration camps during the holocaust is a masterpiece that only Roman Polanski never thought he could show. Adrian Brody's performance is so wonderful that you'll be shaken by his performance; Thomas Kratchsmann as a sympathetic German Nazi soldier to Wladyslaw is another good portrayal in the film that shows how good acting can be when putting a survivalist and a soldier meeting face to face.",10,0,3,8 July 2003
Seabiscuit," A movie that adds hope and courage
","Seabiscuit is the kind of movie that indulges you to believe that no matter how bad the odds are in life, you can always get back on your feet and succeed. One of the best pictures of 2003, is also one of the best American movies ever made. The film takes place in the days of the depression era where money was lost, lives were changed and hope was lost. Jeff Bridges plays Charles Howard, a once bicycle salesman that can change alternaters in cars to run smoothly deals with the lost of his money,the death of his son in a car accident and the divorce of his wife. Tobey Maguire plays Red Pollard, a once smart boy that loved to read until the day his family gave him away to another family in order to stay alive. He is a jockey riding for cash and loses everytime. He boxes, and tells cockeyed stories to fellow Jockeys including George Wolfe played by Gary Stevens. Chris Cooper plays Tom Smith, a trainer who actually understands horses and is befriended by Charles Howard in one scene. What brings these three men together is a race track, and what no better way for gambling none other than horse-racing. The main star of the movie is the character's title, Seabiscuit, a horse that was abused by many of its owners and with the aid of Tom Smith, Seabiscuit is able to compete in many competitions with Red Pollard riding as they lead to many victories. I was touched in many scenes that these characters cared about each other and that Charles who was once down and out is back on his knees and considers Pollard as a son and Tom a partner. Seabiscuit also stars Elizabeth Banks as Marcela Howard and William H. Macy as Tick Tock McColguin a fast talking radio D.J. that gives updates about the race events. I know that many fellow users at IMDB considers this film a patriot movie, but it is not about the American flag, but about hope and the courage to stand up to what people once believed in.",10,1,2,12 August 2004
28 Days Later...," Zombies on Speed!
","As much as I love the George A. Romero zombie flicks from Night of the Living Dead (1968) to Dawn of the Dead (1978), Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later...' is a bloody nightmare of a film and one hell of a ride that I've had the pleasure of experiencing. It's different than most zombie movies because this time around, somebody placed adrenaline on these creatures to make them more scary than before.The film begins after a protest outside of London, England where a bunch of PETA freaks decide to let loose a bunch of caged experiment chimps where they don't know what they've been infected with until one of them catches the disease where all hell starts to begin.28 Days Later after the incident, there's not a single soul walking around the streets or bridges of London. No cars honking or crashing except a lone survivor by the name of Jim (Cillian Murphy in a leading heroic role) gets out of bed to see that he is the only man left on the face of England until he realizes that the apocalypse begins and there are other survivors including Selena (Naomie Harris) and her male friend, Mark (Noah Huntly), they try to see if they could find any weapons they could use to hunt the human creatures down.The way the zombies attack in this film is much more different than having the flesh bitten off, the blood of a zombie has to hit the eye or the inside of your mouth where within a couple of seconds, that person becomes a zombie and has to be killed.After Mark is attacked by zombies and killed by Selena, her and Jim run through the streets of London where they meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter. The four of them embark on a journey where it plays like Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead' with the characters making London their own personal ground stealing stuff before being chased by zombies and fighting off soldiers in a hideaway mansion.'28 Days Later' is truly a virtuoso in horror cinema where in this decade, Danny Boyle must've taken notes to find out how to make a successful horror picture.It sure as hell worked for me.",9,3,4,22 February 2008
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Another Steven Spielberg Classic Comes To Life
","It has been four years since Jurassic Park was destroyed and the island Isla Nublar itself was drowned by a hurricane killing most of the dinosaurs; now there is a new island (called Isla Sorna) that has been genetically engineering the same animals, but abandoned the project after the company InGen declared bankruptcy.The film's short prologue introduces a rich family who are trying to enjoy their vacation on the beach of Isla Sorna, but their little girl wanders off into the jungles of the beach where she encounters a small dinosaur called a Compy in which she assumes it's a friendly creature, but turns out to have little friends of its own when they start pecking body parts of her off screen.Jurassic Park survivor Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) returns to John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) after being called upon. This time Hammond wants Malcolm to send in a team of specialists to go in and document the island where he wants to show the world that the dinosaurs are safe and not dangerous animals. Malcolm finds out that his girlfriend Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) is already on the island and doesn't realize what she's getting into.With the team on the island, they track down Sarah and realize that Malcolm has another surprise that his daughter Kelly has sneaked in one of the trailers and disobeyed her father's orders of staying on the mainland.Another team is on the island not to document but to capture and retrieve the animals to make a zoo. The team is lead by Hammond's nephew Peter Ludlow (Arliss Howard in a bad English accent) who wants to make a profit after the company InGen suffers a lost in profit and damage from the original Jurassic Park. He gets a big game hunter name Roland Tembo (Pete Postelwaite) who wants to bag a Tyrannosaurus Rex as his trophy.The Lost World: Jurassic Park is great entertainment; the special effects are twice worthy than the original. Though I find this film more frightening than the original, it reminds me of the film 'Aliens' where the suspense gets bigger and twice as scary as the original.",10,136,235,19 December 2003
X-Men: The Last Stand," Let the fireworks begin!!!
","This one is the final battle featuring all of our favorite X-Men characters, is it? X-Men III is like Revenge of the Sith, where in the latest installment of the comic book franchise, this is a crowd pleaser. Bryan Singer, who donned the director's chair in the first two installments steps away as Brett Ratner of the Rush Hour franchise takes over.Picking up where X2 left off with the death of Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen), the United States government has stated that they found the cure to all mutants: a child nickname Virus, who's blood not only can take away their powers, but when encounter face-to-face, the power of a mutant can be taken away temporarily. The process has started where after a government official (Michael Murray) discovers his son (Ben Foster) having wings on his back and can fly like a bird in the sky.Back in the school for the gifted, the other characters still mourn for the death of Dr. Gray as some of them try to get on with their lives, while others like Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) can't forget the past as conflicts arise between those in the school such as Rogue (Anna Paquin) and her boyfriend (Shawn Ashmore) falling for another mutant during target practice.Like each of the X-Men installments, we get a new set of characters who steal the movie scenes; while in the first sequel it was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (played by Alan Cumming), in this installment we see Kelsey Grammar (Frasier) as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known to fans as Beast; Vinnie Jones as the barbaric Juggernaut, who cannot be touch or be damaged by any object; Ben Foster as Michael Warrington III, better known as Angel. Many more characters are mentioned, but like the films itself, it scrambles through so many people that we don't have time to know the others while the action takes place. But then again, it is great to see Hugh Jackman reprising his role as Wolverine; Halle Berry as Storm, Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, and Famke Janssen as Jean Gray, reprises from the dead as Phoenix whose powers are much more dangerous than the mutants around her as she can efface a person's flesh and blood into thin air.The plot to the original X-Men movie where it was mutant vs. mutant; the sequel involved mutants, both good and bad reuniting to fight for their species to survive; in this one it is again mutant vs. mutant where Magneto (Ian McKellan) leads his army of Brotherhood with Phoenix by his side and try to stop those who are against them along with the cure registration while the X-Men try to stop Magneto and his army of thugs from trying to kill people and at the same time, not let humanity drive them afraid.Despite what you think of my review, or hear what others say, X-Men III is a fantastic film, fully blooded with special effects where the roller coaster ride doesn't end. In general, this is the best way to end a great comic book trilogy! I wouldn't be surprise if more installments would be in the works!",10,24,43,26 May 2006

School of Rock," coolest school and rock n'roll movie
","what i really liked about School of Rock is that this if the first family film to take any kid. What is positive about the film on both school and rock n' roll is that the film shows respect to both sides. With school, Jack Black doesn't hate it, he respects it; but he uses the metaphor 'the man' to prove that with there are some things in society that can't be beaten.  With music, on the other hand, it is so cool to hear rock music instead of rap and disco and all that sissy stuff.",10,0,0,24 October 2003
Ghostbusters," A blend of comedy, horror and special effects that go together very well
","Ghostbusters came out in the summer of 1984 just before I was born and would later be a fan of the film along with its products as I got older with age.The film's premise involves three scientist at a local college in New York where they get kicked out due to lack of funding and poor judgment. The leader of the trio is Dr. Peter Venkman (cool performance by Bill Murray) who not only experiments with people as part of his project, but if it's a seducing woman then Peter would do his best to get the girl. His life is basically sex, money and rock and roll while his two associates Dr. Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd delivering major punchlines) a free-spirited scientist that loves his work around the paranormal and Dr. Egon Spangler (Harold Ramis) a no non-sense scientist take their work serious and need to do something once they get kicked out of school. Peter decides that with their knowledge they could open up a business of getting rid of the paranormal after encountering a ghost in the library.Somehow things don't go well until the three members (who are known as Ghostbusters) meet a woman by the name of Dana Barrett (Sigorney Weaver of 'Alien' fame) who believes that her apartment is haunted after getting notice from a neighbor that her TV was turned on loud and didn't even know about it along with seeing a creature inside her refrigerator. Peter has taken interest in Dana Barrett while seeing that nothing is wrong in her apartment just before getting called into action as the Ghostbusters take their first job before being famous. With so much ghosts in the area of New York they hire Winston Zeddmore (Ernie Hudson) before more things come in their way from a pesky environmental agent (William Atherton) who wants to shut down the good guys while Dana and her neighbor Louis Tully (Rick Moranis) get attacked by the spirits in the apartment where later all havoc breaks loose and it's up to the Ghostbusters to save the day.'Ghostbusters' has three things that made the film successful: comedy, a spooky element and a special effects movie where they all work without letting the audience down. Bill Murray is classic where most of his lines will be forever be quoted by fans while at the same time blends comedy in the first act of the film while being serious in the second act when things get out of hand. Aykroyd and Ramis, who wrote the script, make sure they can write a comedy without losing the audience and be subtle at the same time with certain scenes. The spooky parts involving the monsters will more or less likely scare kids away while the special effects will have you begging for more.",10,2,3,23 June 2003
Gran Torino," Dirty Harry has a gun in his backyard!
","It seems that nothing ever seems to stop Clint Eastwood from making movies as he already made two tragic masterpieces that earned Academy Award nominations for best picture (Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby); a two part war epic showing the point of view during the Iwo Jima battles between the Americans and the Japanese (Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima), and a mother searching for her son (Changling).This time Eastwood returns to the directing and acting chair in 'Gran Torino' about a Korean War veteran (Clint, as Walt Kowalski) who hates people of all races and creed that he barely smiles even in the first scene where his wife has passed away and doesn't show sorrow with the exception of hatred from his family who never visited him; treat him like a used tool only to be thrown away until next time. Walt's worst hatred is his own grandkids who don't show respect for the elders, God, or even offer to help him with anything while pondering about his question with death; his granddaughter, who dresses like a slut, asks if she could have his prized possession: A 1972 Gran Torino, as her reward when he dies.If Walt's hatred of his family isn't getting worse, it's his new Hmong neighbors next door who move in next door leaving Walt to shame God even more despite the fact that where he lives has Asians. It's not until one day that the son next door tries to break in to steal his car as part of entering his cousin's pathetic gang. Walt lets him escape after a mess up, but it's not until the veteran saves the child and his family's lives when the gang tries to harass them. He's a hero to the community but Walt doesn't want to give in yet. But he does where he thinks of the Hmongs as his own family despite saying slurs and considers them as those he trusts in case something were to ever happen to him.The film was overlooked at the Oscars for unknown reasons, even though Clint earned a nomination at the Critics Choice Awards. More people seemed to pay attention to 'Slumdog Millionaire' where it won the Oscars and the hype of India and the rags to riches story died off later. But then again, the Oscars in Feburary were a big joke, despite the fact that there were better films of 2008 from 'The Wrestler,' 'Wall-E,' 'Doubt,' 'The Dark Knight,' including this film where Clint Eastwood can't be stopped no matter if he's directing or acting.",9,2,8,9 June 2009
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Short, sweet, fun and more dazzling.
","'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer' is the sequel to the 2005 box-office hit where not only are all four heroes back in town, but they get their first PG rating in comic book history.Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffard), Susan Storm/Invincible Woman (Jessica Alba), Ben Grimm/The Thing (Michael Chiklis), and Johnny Storm/The Human Torch (Chris Evans) are back where after saving the world from Dr. Doom (Julian McMahon) in the original movie, the quartet heroes have became international superstars where fans young and old take an admire in them. After going home, things are not really back to normal as plans change for Reed and Susan's wedding when an enemy known as The Silver Surfer has plans of ridding planet earth once and for all unless the famous four members do something about it.While many comic book movies from the Spider-Man trilogy, the Blade series, The X-Men trilogy and others have been over 100 minutes long, somehow this sequel manages to be under ninety minutes while never disappointing fans of the movie and the comic series. There's laughs, thrills, tears and cheers in every direction where there's nothing wrong with this picture at all. I don't know why the critics dissed this film since most of them probably never read a comic book.",9,1,3,25 February 2008
Men in Black II," Falls flat among sequels!
","The original 'Men In Black' was truly a one-of-a-kind entertainment filled with laughter, thrills and science fiction references all over the place. Just like many blockbuster films, a sequel must take place.Why? After K (Tommy Lee Jones) is retired and away from the M.I.B. headquarters, J (Will Smith) has taken over K's position where he's nothing but a rebel without a cause. In the original movie, Will Smith was just like many of his other characters who didn't know what the hell was going on until he knew and stood up to the plate to take action. Here he's a wild cannon knowing most of New York along with having partners that leave him when they screw-up.The new villain in town is played by Lara Flynn Boyle an alien, like Edgar from the original, that takes the shape and form of those they contact. In the original the alien ripped Edgar's body apart only to take the skin where Lara's character is like the T-1000 from T2 where all she has to do is look at the object and transform into it.After a witness (Rosario Dawson) sees her boss inflated like a balloon by an alien, it's up to J to protect her and reinforce Tommy Lee Jones's character into action.There were a couple of chuckles, but there wasn't enough scenes I could remember that I cared for nor care about this movie.",5,0,0,24 February 2008
Million Dollar Baby," 2004's Best Picture Masterpiece
","Today I finally had the pleasure of watching 'Million Dollar Baby' on the DVD and I got to tell you that this is one of best boxing films and also the greatest Clint Eastwood film ever made at the same time.The film concentrates on the principal actors Clint Eastwood as the trainer, Morgan Freeman as the Narrator and friend, and Hilary Swank as the woman who wanted out of her old life to be a boxer, in which we get to study these look at these characters as human beings rather than just actors playing a part.Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a former professional boxer and trainer who runs a local boxing gym with his buddy Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) in which Jimmie knows the ropes on how to fight, how to move and how to win. In the prologue of the film, we see Frankie trying to heal a scar from a boxer before the boxing doctor comes to check. The character of Frankie Dunn doesn't have faith in the people he trains, after in a scene he tells the boxer that he doesn't want him to fight to get the title or else he'll get hurt; especially when Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) tries to come in and box at the gym, he tells Maggie that he doesn't train girls because it will look bad on his reputation.Maggie Fitzgerald has always dream of becoming a boxer as she attends every fight event that takes place in order to talk to Frankie, but he refuses to train her because she is too old. It doesn't stop Maggie as every day and night she trains at the boxing gym where Eddie gives out advice and tells her how to posture her movement. She doesn't quit until Frankie decides to help her. During the prologue of the film, Eddie explains the story behind Maggie as we see her working as a waitress in a dead-end job where she steals most of the leftover food and takes it back to her house where she eats the food.Eddie is the narrator, and the character that Morgan Freeman portrays is similar to Red Boyle from 'The Shawshank Redemption' in which the character talks about the events that took place especially getting to know the characters a little better. Eddie is blind from one eye as he explains to Maggie that he lost it in his 109th fight when Frankie was his manager; he also lives in the gym where he has a small room near the entrance where he sleeps, eats and watches TV. Like Frankie, Eddie takes in a poor retard from the streets named Danger Barch (Jay Baruchel) in which the retard has dreams of winning the championship title; though the kid may never have a chance, Eddie will believe in him.'Million Dollar Baby' is more than your ordinary boxing flick; it's also a character movie where we get to know these three characters and actually have feelings for them as we root them on. I was cheering when I watched this film as I watch the character Maggie win all the fights, including having a smile on my face when we saw Maggie and Frankie talking during a road trip. The last forty minutes of the film is a sad tragedy as we lose one of the main characters of the film; it is truly a great and powerful scene.Last year I saw Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' a tragedy about three men and the nightmare that came back to haunt them; that was one of the best films I've ever seen from a Clint Eastwood movie; now after watching 'Million Dollar Baby' on the DVD, Clint has completed his tragedy masterpiece where I will never forget that people do have chances in life.",10,1,2,12 July 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," A Family Feast
","In my review of Halloween, I said that October 31st is my favorite day of the year because of the excitement and the joy, but as a little boy, Christmas was my favorite day of the year where I would see people gathering and talking about things they did that year, not to mention the gifts I would receive. In Tim Burton's latest production, the film is about two worlds joining together in a wrecking mayhem.Jack the Pumpkin King is the leader of 'Halloween Town' where every Halloween, his band of misfit monsters would go and scare all the children in the world; as much as he's fed up of scaring people, Jack wants to find out about the other traditions that people celebrate and finds out the Christmas is the one he likes as he sees the snow dropping from the sky, to a decorate Christmas tree with children playing inside houses, he wants to adopt the tradition into the Halloween world where everything is chaos as the little monsters kidnap Santa Claus and take him hostage where Jack takes the place of Santa putting monsters in stockings. What a hoot to watch.After watching so many of Burton movies, this is the one where I can watch with my nieces next to the first Batman and Pee Wee's Big Adventure as family films where these films are not as nightmarish as other films I have watched.",10,1,2,27 May 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Can there be any real honesty in the newsroom or on television?
","Television can be described in some factors: 'This tube is the gospel...It can break or make presidents...you do whatever the tube tells you; you dress like a tube, you eat like a tube, you feed your children like a tube.' Howard Beale (Peter Finch- Network (1976) 'To those who say people wouldn't look; they wouldn't be interested; they're too complacent, indifferent and insulated, I can only reply: There is, in one reporter's opinion, considerable evidence against that contention. But even if they are right, what have they got to lose? Because if they are right, and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost. This instrument can teach, it can illuminate; yes, and it can even inspire. But it can do so only to the extent that humans are determined to use it to those ends. Otherwise it is merely wires and lights in a box.' Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn- Good Night and Good Luck (2005) George Clooney's 'Good Night and Good Luck' is a look back in the 1950's during the McCarthrism era of communism where CBS reporter Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) does what he can along with his team of news reporters to bring down Senator Joseph McCartney and his theories of frightening America. Besides the fact that Murrow portrays truth and inside information for his public to understand, we see what else goes on in the boardroom from staff members such as Fred Friendly (George Clooney), CBS reporter Don Hollenback (Ray Wise) and others find stories that are good enough for the ratings.With the film under ninety minutes, director/actor/co-star/co-writer George Clooney shows what else goes on inside the world of journalism prior to freedom of speech. There are subplots where workers for the CBS news are questioned by the government on communism to two staff members (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) who keep their marriage quiet and realize they are breaking a rule stating that married couples are not allowed to work in the same company.With today in the world of journalism, who can tell the truth about what is going on? Or is it all about looks and personality? While I wasn't familiar with Edward R. Murrow since I was born in the early 1980's, everyday I watch different news broadcasts and see what kind of stories they have to point out everyday. Why is it that people like to watch the news? Is it because they want to find out about what goes on in the world or is it about looks? Many people would watch the news to see Diane Sawyer or Peter Jennings's looks where as seeing Dan Rather for his somewhat redneck humor he probably got from a Jeff Foxworthy book.While being under the impression that Mr. Clooney's father worked in a news station when the actor was a child, I was impressed he can do more than just play a hero on screen or in real life.If i had words to end my comment: Pure talent!",10,3,4,25 February 2008
Dumb and Dumber," Possibly the best buddy flick ever made along with being Jim Carrey's finest hour
","There have been many movies that made me laugh during my youth, but none haven't made me spray milk out of my nose with the exception of 'Dumb and Dumber' which is possibly the most gut busting laugh fest ever made with 'Scary Movie' coming behind in second place.Dumb and Dumber is about two of the most idiotic characters in cinema history with Jim Carrey as the role of Lloyd Christmas, a simple minded but nice guy who can't seem to hold a job before holding a position of a limo driver where he falls in love with a passenger girl name Mary (Lauren Holly)before dropping her off at the airport. Lloyd's best friend and companion is Harry Dunn, played by Jeff Daniels, in which like Lloyd, Harry is a loser in his own way. The scruffy hair buddy drives dogs on the way to the dog shows for which his van is detail of one like a dog with giant ears on the side. Both friends lose their jobs until Harry sees that Lloyd is carrying an unknown briefcase that belonged to Mary from the airport in which the two of them embark in a journey where mishaps and misery are engaged to those that get near Harry and Lloyd together.The film is a high mark for Jim Carrey who already succeeded box office gold with Ace Venture: Pet Detective at the time, but instead of butt jokes it's all about the pranks and gags from the comic. Jeff Daniels took me by surprise where instead of playing a normal guy in such films as Speed and Arachnophobia, he shows that he can place his acting chops into comedy. They make quite the duo to make my day.Note: A sequel was made in which all fans of the original should stay away from it.",8,2,3,14 May 2008
Shrek 2," Like a chart, it rises and falls
","Shrek 2 was one of the promising sequels in 2004 where after the first movie was a box-office hit three years before because it introduced a character full of life and energy.The whole gang's back, but with a little bit less energy.After Shrek (Mike Myers) and Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) marry from the first film, they come back from their honeymoon where their old pal Donkey (Eddie Murphy) is waiting for them. They receive a note from Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julia Andrews) that they are invited to stay with them in Far, Far, Away. There are two problems with this situation: 1.) Fiona is now an ogre, 2.) How will she break the news that she's a monster while her husband is not prince charming? In Shrek 2, we get more characters from The Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who's ticked off after her son Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) didn't marry Fiona to break the spell and threatens Fiona's father if things don't go well as plan. There's Puss-In-Boots (Antonio Banderas), a cat with a Zorro like attitude who shows his 'P' signature as he is hired by Fiona's father to take care of the lovable ogre until the jolly green giant gets his hand on him first.The sequel carries the tradition of the original film where it plays a satire of every pop culture we've seen from movies, television shows and in music. Some parts of the film work, but it doesn't have the same energy as the first movie where it blended in ethnic jokes with bad language; something between Blazing Saddles and Young Frankenstein as I mentioned in my review of the first movie. Somehow the film itself is like the first film itself, but then again it's Shrek and I like this film. I don't love this film as much as I do with the classic original, but who can resist the lovable ogre?",7,0,1,22 February 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," It's going to be one night to remember.
","Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have different styles of making pictures for audiences, where they would have different taste in violence and culture in their movies; now they work together with a different project: Vampires! Though Robert Rodriguez brings in the Latin spice and Quentin Tarantino brings in the pop culture with the black and white gangster suits, it's a wild ride.The synopsis of 'From Dusk Till Dawn' deals with the murderous Gecko Brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) who are on a running spree from the authority. Seth is the play-it-cool and older brother while Richie has his own psychopathic thoughts; and in the film's prologue, Richie shoots a deputy for no reason, but assumes that the clerk ratted them out.As they are on the run, The Gecko Brothers have a female bank teller hostage in the back of their trunk and later while Seth is gone, Richie rapes her and makes up an excuse for why he killed her.After Richie screws up the plan, knowing that they might get caught, Seth decides to take action and force a minister named Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) to take them to Mexico, or else they'll be executed one by one.Jacob takes his RV with the kids and the Gecko Brothers where they make it across the border and go to a strip bar where Seth and Richie have to meet some associates. In the strip bar, bikers and truckers punch each other while strippers dance around them.Everything turns to hell after a lap dance in which the battle begins when all the strippers turn into vampires killing a supporting character and the rest of the bikers and truckers as the survivors try to make it to the night without getting killed.'From Dusk Till Dawn' is like the 'Evil Dead' series where it is fun from beginning to finish with George Clooney in his first breakout role and the collaboration of Rodriguez and Tarantino makes this film a funhouse.",10,1,2,21 June 2003
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's return to a classic film.
","In my review of 'Planet of the Apes' (2001), I wrote that the film was Tim Burton's worst film up to date along with it being the worst remake I have ever seen in theaters where I'm going to admit that I didn't enjoy it very much. However, when I saw the trailer for this remake of the Gene Wilder classic 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' I was amazed to see how amazing it looked before buying the film on DVD in which I got my treats after Halloween in 2005.'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', going by the same title as the famous book, is about a poor boy name Charlie (Freddie Highmore) living in a shack house with his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and four grandparents where after his father loses his job because a machine replaced him at the toothpaste factory, they must do things to make ends meet while on in the rest of the world, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) has a contest where five tickets are hidden around the world in five separate Wonka bars. The first ticket goes to a fat boy name Augustus in Switzerland; two tickets hit the United States where a karate/bubble gum lover gal and a video game punk addict win the tickets while in England the last two tickets go to a spoil English girl and Charlie.The five kids along with their adult guardian head to Wonka's factory where if you seen the original movie, there's no reason for me to continue with the summary.Tim Burton's 'Charlie' is a gift from the director where he gives more an elaborate on Willy Wonka than just showing him as a goofy man. The performances are outstanding with Freddie Highmore portraying Charlie as a reasonable child who wants nothing more than to be with his family along with Johnny Depp off the Jack Sparrow as Wonka where even though its strange to see Depp playing such a quirky guy, there's nothing stopping the actor. The rest of the great cast include David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, AnnaSophia Robb as Violet, and Deep Roy not playing one, but many of the oompa loompas in this film where he even got paid a million dollar bonus.10/10",10,2,4,26 March 2008
Mission: Impossible II," Ethan Hunt is back with a new director!
","Mission: Impossible II is the sequel to the 1996 blockbuster where this time around Face/Off director, John Woo, takes charge behind the seat to give the audience what the first movie should have been in the first place.Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is on vacation climbing mountains where he gets interrupted by his boss (Anthony Hopkins in an uncredit cameo) that a mad agent (Dougray Scott of Ever After) who used to work with Hunt and the agency has plans of his own after a plane crashed in the Rocky Mountains where he has the biochemical weapons to end half the world. The chemical is known as Chimara where once the person is injected with the substance, it'll only be a matter of time before the body rots and infect half an entire population.Hunt is on the lookout for Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), one hot babe who used to date Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott) in which he wants her on his team along with using Nyah to sneak whatever information Sean has about the chemicals and report. They fall in love at the same time where mixing work and pleasure isn't a good idea. Ethan also brings his former partner in crime Luther (Ving Rhames), a computer high tech engineer who tracks and traces anybody with his computers. The fourth member is Billy Baird (John Polson) who provides comic relief as a helicopter pilot along with disguising himself whenever possible.The real reason to love Mission: Impossible 2 is the action that John Woo brings to the screen. You gotta hand it to him when it comes to wham/bam/thank you ma'am scenes that make you want to rewind on your DVD player to watch along with mixing emotion to make this film one bad-ass movie. Everything about this film sizzles where every frame is just hot after another.",9,8,14,31 March 2008
Black Hawk Down," A war movie that's too close to home
","'Black Hawk Down' made it's motion picture debut in limited release in early December of 2001 but didn't open nationwide in my hometown until late January of 2002 where after the attacks of 9/11, people started to take precaution on how to protect themselves from terrorist threats. Airport security became enhanced, many people started buying action flicks from 'Die Hard' to 'True Lies' on how to protect themselves and fight off anybody willing to repeat the same incident.'Black Hawk Down' however would show audiences what it would be like to send young troops in another country to deal with somebody else's problem just before a year later it would be too close to home.Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) directs this epic about the 1993 incident in Mogadishu where genocide is happening to the civilians and U.S. soldiers are there to rescue the people and take down their top target. Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor) plays Sgt. Eversmann, a young soldier who believes he's in it to save the people and hope they have a better future. Other soldiers have different agendas while being stationed in Mogadishu until they are called by General Garrison (Sam Sheppard) to go inside the city where all hell breaks loose. The townspeople are now in war with the U.S. soldiers where the film cuts to different sections with different actors from Tom Sizemore who leads one part of an infantry by cars; Ewan McGregor plays Grimes who joins in with William Fitchner after being separated from his squad sees what it's like to be in the war rather than typing on computers.After movies like 'Saving Private Ryan' came out in theaters, directors wanted to make realistic war movies and Ridley Scott does one hell of a job without having to bring in a sermon lesson. The list of actors feature an all-star cast from Josh Hartnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan Bremmer and William Fitchner who all worked in 'Pearl Harbor' and do much hell of a better job than in 'Harbor' while having other cast members from Ewan McGregor, Sam Sheppard, Jason Issacs, Eric Bana and more.",10,0,0,21 June 2003
A Bug's Life," A real charmer.
","1998 was the battle of the bugs between Dreamworks' 'Antz' to Disney's 'A Bug's Life'. While Antz was an animated movie of a Woody Allen (the voice of Z in Antz) film making references to psychology, Judiasm, sexes and other trademarks, A Bug's Life was just plain good old' entertainment where there were jokes for both the kids and adults to understand and not have to worry about a moral or being bored.If Antz dealt with the underground of ants and their life styles, then A Bug's Life has all the insects we keep as either pets or a collection of squished items on the floor.This film is about a little ant name Flik (voice by Dave Foley of Kids in the Hall) an inventor/screw-up where he messes up during the most important event of the season. The season of summer for ants is probably one of the most dreaded season since all the ants have to gather food for the menacing grasshoppers where the vicious leader of the gang, Hopper (voice by Kevin Spacey), thinks of the ants as inferior slaves where at any time they could have their head squish. Flik does something to lose all the food where everybody depends on him to be the hero to find somebody to step up to the grasshoppers. So the little ant goes into town to find any insects where in a sort of 'Three Amigos' scenario he finds a group of bugs and ask to help him and the ant colony where he doesn't know that they're a bunch of circus flunkies.'A Bug's Life' is a barrel of laughs where not only will people find this better than 'Antz' but find something within all the characters.As for the cast line up prior to Dave Foley and Kevin Spacey, there's also Julia-Louis Dreyfus, Brad Garrett, Richard Kind, David Hyde Pierce, Bonnie Hunt, Phylis Diller, Denis Leary and more to make you want to come back for more.",9,2,2,19 March 2008
Big Fish," Another Kind of Fairy Tale
","Fairy Tales come in all shapes and sizes; we had films from Disney about relationships (Beauty and the Beast, The Little Mermaid, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, and Cinderella); Steven Spielberg and his Sci-Fi movies about average people seeing the impossible (Jurassic Park, E.T., and CEO3K); now in Tim Burton's film 'Big Fish,' the imagination has gone beyond our wildest dreams, where one person stories has made a difference to others.'Big Fish' is a story about a father (Albert Finney) and his son (Billy Crudup) in which the son doesn't want to have a relation with his father after many of the bologna stories he has heard from time to time about the big fish, a giant, and meeting the love of his life (Jessica Lange).The character Ed Bloom (Finney) is dying of cancer and his wife has called her only son with his wife to fly from Paris to visit his dying father. As it turns out, the son's wife is going to have a baby, and during the visit, they all want to hear the stories that Bloom has said before.In the pastime, Ewan McGregor plays the young Ed Bloom for which he was the town's hero; he was a jock, a nerd, an inventor or a renaissance man as you might recall him. Until one day, a giant has stock upon the small town that Ed had lived and it is up to him to defeat the giant where he finds out that the creature himself is harmless. In the story, the older Ed tells stories about a young predicator; a group of townspeople that never changed, how he met his sweetheart by working in a circus, entering the Korean War and getting into business to support his wife and child.Like Harvey Pekar from 'American Splendor,' I can also relate to Ed Bloom from 'Big Fish' where the character Ed was a dreamer and a storyteller who wasn't afraid to share it with the rest of the people around him. I was a storyteller in high school where I would tell stories to all the students about what happened during the early days at the school I attended to the people and the events that changed our lives; I was also a dreamer, but unfortunately, my dreams of getting the girl, getting a standing ovation at graduation or having people thanking me for all I did, didn't come true. I just pray that my final story involves my older brother carrying me, like Ed's son did for Ed, and everybody I knew would just be waving and cheering me on as I go on to turn into a fish myself.This is by far the most personal and best Tim Burton movie I've ever seen.",9,0,1,26 May 2005
Quiz Show," An Excellent Movie!
","Are game shows really rigged? I remember watching this week that 'Jeopardy!' ace Ken Jennings who won $2 Million last year from seventy-four games, lost to another opponent in which throughout the final games, Ken wasn't the same as he would answer quickly in previous games, but would make goofy faces as he loses. In Robert Redford's film, we discover how the producers of NBC's Twenty-One rigged every contestant on the show where eventually somebody would find out.The name of the game is Twenty-One and like 'Jeopardy!' itself, the game show has various categories from history, science, math, movies, etc., and the champion is Herb Stempel (gifted actor John Turturro) a Jew living in Brooklyn who has won over various tournaments with a winning streak of over $100,000 where he knows all of the commercials by heart, and is being bribed by producer Dan Enright (David Paymer) so that way the show can get a new contestant who is better looking and not that hideous to TV viewers.During interviews for contestants, a pretty boy WASP teacher name Charles Van Doran (Ralph Finnees) tries out for the quiz show Tic-Tac-Dough were Enright tries to get Van Doran into the show Twenty-One to beat Stempel, and decides to go through with it, just because Enright B.S'd the cause of education to him.Now after Van Doran has beaten Stempel, Redford shows the audiences the ups and down of a successful individual having fame, getting the answers from the producers, and losing the persona he once had.Attorney Dick Goodwin (Rob Morrow, another gifted actor) reads Stempel's article about Twenty-One being rigged, so now Goodwin is investigating whether the incident is true or not and if Van Doran is being fed the answers from Enright instead of looking the answers by himself.'Quiz Show' is not just a movie, but a document on what goes on the inside of a game show where the next time you watch a game show, you ask yourself: Are these people actually smart, or are they just being fed answers like everybody else? Are game shows discriminative towards people of genders and races? Or for the matter, is Ken Jennings really smart, or did Alex and the gang from 'Jeopardy!' feed him the answers and later played him a fool?",10,1,1,27 May 2005
The Dark Knight," Not just a superhero movie, but an accomplishment in cinema history
","In 2005, British director Christopher Nolan directed 'Batman Begins' a re-birth of the Batman franchise where not only fans get to see the dark side of Gotham City, but also the understanding of how Bruce Wayne came to be.Here, Christopher Nolan wastes no time with the action...Batman Begins ended with The Joker being the next villain for the next movie, and he, I repeat, he does not disappoint. The late Heath Ledger goes to extreme as the maniacal clown in the beginning of the movie where him and his thugs are robbing the Gotham City Bank; he shows a mean and sadistic side killing people left and right before leaving with the stolen money.Batman/Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), on the other hand, is bringing down the criminals one by one with the aid of Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman) while joining forces of the new district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckert). He's also accompanied with his trusted butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine) who guides him whether he's Batman or Bruce Wayne and gadgets expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who supplies everything that Batman needs to fight crime while at the same time Bruce is trying to rekindle things with his ex-girlfriend/district attorney Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllanhall replacing Katie Holmes) while she's going out with Harvey Dent.The film itself is a phenomenal from minute one where you can't keep your eyes off of the screen, even touching scenes will get to you. The premise of 'The Dark Knight' has The Joker taking Gotham City hostage where he'll execute and hunt down people one by one unless Batman himself surrenders along with those who want to bring down the criminals. In other words, everybody is a ticking time bomb, including Batman and those around him, where the hero must be everywhere before the menacing clown will strike and not breaking his promise.The action sequences are promising where Christopher Nolan doesn't use much CGI to make it a true extravaganza. They have the sort of 'Holy Crap' moments where your eyes don't want to shield away from the rest of the movie along with seeing if others are okay.As much as acting goes, there was not one flaw in each of the performances. Christian Bale is dynamic as the hero where not only is he playing two personas, but bringing human emotion as both the human and the savior. Oldman, Caine and Freeman have much larger roles where they're part of the action from secrecy to betrayal; Maggie Gyllanhall wasn't a flaw unlike Katie Holmes, and Aaron Eckhart played a convincing Dent, but the true star in this motion picture is Heath Ledger.Heath, who died at the age of twenty-eight in the beginning of 2008, plays not only one of the sadistic villains ever made on screen but one scary Joker compared to Romero (1960's) and Nicholson's (1989) campiness of the clown prince of crime and Mark Hamill's (animated Joker) cackling voice where there's no clowning around when it comes to blowing up buildings, using school buses to transport money, killing crime bosses and cops left and right to creating madness all around. Hopefully he'll receive a posthumous Oscar nomination for his work making him the first actor in a comic book movie to be nominated for an Academy Award.Once again, Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job of making a Batman movie where he steps it up a notch along with making it the top DC comic book movie ever made. Now whether you agree with my review or not, I really love 'The Dark Knight'.(Note: This is not a typical comic book movie for the young or weak hearted)",10,6,14,18 July 2008

Rowling saga and like each of its films, they keep getting darker and better not to mention bringing along a different crowd rather than the readers, the fans of the atmosphere, or people who have crushes on the actors.David Yates is the fourth director of the HP franchise and doesn't too much of a bad job turning a six-hundred something book into a 138 piece of entertainment (note: this is the shortest Harry Potter saga so far. Will it be two hours next time?) Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return to their roles as Harry, Ron and Hermione in which in this latest installment Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back and nobody believes Harry Potter's story, not even his own peers once he returns to school for his fifth year. The stakes are high this time with everybody in Harry's path becoming a danger to him, even his muggle of a cousin Dudley Dursely who gets struck by a Dementor.Things are changing in Hogwarts after Harry's use of magic in front of humans as Dolores Umbridge, played wickedly with delight by Imelda Staunton, takes over as the Dark Arts Teacher and has set a fear through the students and faculty by changing rules, firing teachers, having the Ministry of Magic all over the school's business and so forth. Harry Potter on the other hand has figured out that his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was part of a group along with Harry's parents and families of the young hero's friends where he comes up with the group Dumbledore's Army to teach whoever wants to get rid of the evil that's heading their way to Hogwarts.Order of the Phoenix is spectacular entertainment from minute one where like Prisoner of Azkaban, you don't have to read the books or be a fan of the series.This movie's for anybody.",10,3,7,11 July 2007
Toy Story," A delight!
","Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do.Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of 'Ghostbusters' fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of 'Ernest' fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).One of the elements of 'Toy Story' is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.'Toy Story' is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of 'Monsters, Inc.' it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.",10,0,0,19 March 2005
Men in Black," Original is always best
","Back in the 80's we had 'Who You Gonna Call?' from the movie 'Ghostbusters,' now we have the slogan 'Protecting the Earth from the scum of the universe' in which 'Men In Black' deals with aliens taking over the planet as secret agents try to protect those who should live and who should be exterminated.The cast involves Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K, a no nonsense man who plays everything by the book, drives a cool black car that can flip upside down when driving in a tunnel, speaking all the languages from alien tongue to Spanish; even erasing people's memories. His partner is Agent J, played by Will Smith, in which he doesn't get what the hell is going on until the second act. And that's great about most of the Will Smith movies I have seen (ID4, I, Robot, Enemy of the State) where his character doesn't know what the hell is going on in the first act, until the second act where he takes charge and in the end, he kicks butt.The main villain is an alien from another galaxy in which he rips the body off a bumbling farmer, Edgar (Vincent D'Onifero) and inserts his body into his where the alien Edgar shocks his human wife by asking for more sugar.'Men In Black' is the 'Ghostbusters' of the 90's for which it balances the laughter and fun at the same time where people would not be afraid to take their little ones to see this movie. I only recommend seeing the original and not the lame sequel.",Null,2,3,24 May 2005
The Mummy Returns," Just as the same as the original, but more action and a few laughs
","'The Mummy Returns' is the sequel to the 1999 box-office sleeper starring Brendan Fraser as John O'Connell, a swashbuckling adventurer stealing many of the treasures of Egypt along with having to stop an evil un-dead God from taking over the world.Six years pass as John is married to librarian/archaeologist lover Evelyn Carnahan (Rachel Weisz) from the first movie where they are doing the same adventures where they have a son, Alexander (Freddie Boath), joining in on the action. Evelyn starts having visions where she pictures herself as this other person back in Egypt before discovering something deep in the caverns of one of their expeditions. The bracelet of Anubis is in the hands of the O'Connell's.In another part of London, Blatus Hafez (Alun Armstrong) has his own agenda where he wants to raise Prince Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) back from the dead to awake the Scorpion King (The Rock) and unleash hell all over the world. Blatus gets help from Meela Nais (Patricia Valesquez) who bares a resemblance to Imhotep's girlfriend Anuk-Su-Namun from the first Mummy movie.Along the way, Alex is kidnapped by Blatus's goons where they believe the parents will give when the bracelet of Anubis is handed by them.John Hannah brings comic relief as Johnathan Caranhan, Evelyn's brother, and gets involve in more action scenes. Oded Fehr returns as Ardeth Bay, the anti-hero from the first movie who plays a much larger role than in the original where he's more of a hero and ally.It's good fun, but it takes too much formula of the original movie from the special effects, including a water chase sequence that looks like the sand chase from the first movie. There's also a character in the film called Izzy where his name sounds like a derivate of Beni just like in the original. There's more screams and surprises than in the original where there's hardly any laughs despite one or two scenes.",7,0,1,22 February 2008
Grindhouse," Two Movies For The Price of One!
","Whenever people hear the word 'Grindhouse' they think about slaughterhouses. But in movie definition, the term Grindhouse can be describe as paying one admission to see two back-to-back movies involving blood, guts, spit, ass, jiggly breasts, innovated weapons, hot women, crazy characters, crappy dialog, and grizzly scenes to make you cheer or want to vomit.I wanted to wait until after I saw both movies on Starz! yesterday to start my review. It's really a bloodbath along with shocks coming in all directions. Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino combine everything they have from Rodriguez's Latin culture, love for horror cinema, gruesome gore and everything he can pull in his one man show from Tarantino's love for old classic movies and shows to making references from previous movies he's work on; blaxpliotation films in the 70's and bringing back actors to play the parts they were born to play.The first film out of the two movies is Planet Terror, directed by Robert Rodriguez. It's really a mix of Night of the Living Dead along with other classic horror movies as well. The film starts in a small part of Texas with Rose McGowan as a stripper name Cherry who plans on being a stand up comedian after not feeling like dancing anymore while meeting with her old boyfriend El Wray, played by Freddy Rodriguez of Six Feet Under, one cool Vato Hombre with a reputation that'll make your hair stand up. Meanwhile, in a part of the same area, Naveen Andrews (of Lost fame) is making a business trade with the military in which the chemicals he has create exposed zombies out of anybody that'll smell the substance. In another subplot, Dr. William Block (Josh Brolin) suspects something suspicious out of his wife/nurse Dakota (Marley Shelton) before finding out at the hospital. All hell is breaking loose in the small city where various victims go to the hospital after being bitten and start carrying infections where within a couple of minutes, they start to become mindless zombies going after everybody, including Cherry where her leg is cut off. Wray along with Cherry and a group of other people including the hard-ass sheriff Hague (Michael Biehn) and his clumsy assistant Tolo (Tom Savini, special effects artist) fight off the hordes of zombies before becoming the victims.Rodriguez's 'Planet Terror' is described as bad-ass and one of the best horror/action segments I've ever seen in recent years. The way the film looks from frame one is an homage to all of the early films in the seventies where specks and spots would be seen not to mention a famous blooper along the way. Other actors include Jeff Fahey as a cook with some of the wittiest catchphrases along with Stacy Ferguson as a smoking hot babe and friend of Dakota before becoming one of the devoured victims; Michael Parks as the famous Earl McGraw, Quentin has a small role as a horned up army soldier who has an eye for Cherry before exposing his parts along with Bruce Willis as the man in charge of the military.Rodriguez is the master of his domain! 4 out of 4 stars.The next half is Quentin Tarantino's 'Death Proof' where it pays respect to actors who did their own stunts along with slasher movies where the sexy women always died. 'Death Proof' takes place just before Planet Terror in Austin, Texas where a group of girls led by Vanessa Ferlito decide to have fun by drinking beers, hearing music and getting high. They meet Stuntman Mike (an eerie Kurt Russell) who is hitting on a blonde girl (Rose McGowan in another performance) before he talks to them. Ferlito's character is spooked of Stuntman Mike by the fact that his black car has been following her since she had gotten out of the apartment. After leaving the bar, Stuntman Mike takes his blonde beauty, Pam (Rose McGowan), hostage just before killing her and killing Ferlito's friends in the process. Fourteen years pass where Stuntman Mike starts his rampage of harassing young women all over again where this time he might meet his match if Rosario Dawson along with Zoe Bell could do something about it.Overall, 'Death Proof' was good but not in the strength of a Tarantino classic nor as bad-ass as 'Planet Terror.' I loved Tarantino's choice of choosing Kurt Russell as Mike where it's been years since he played a character of tenacious and cool over the past from MacReady in John Carpenter's The Thing, to Snake in the 'Escape' movies and Jack O'Neill in Stargate. The stunt scenes with Zoe Bell in a car chase sequence is one of the craziest I've seen in all my life where I closed my eyes. My only complaint had been that Tarantino's dialog and references slowed the pace along with the fact that after the first 56 minutes of the film, the reel look from the 70's was gone.3 1/2 out of 4 Stars.Overall, this is just a movie fan's dream come true.",9,0,0,9 March 2008
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Too much like the original in some points, but still funny
","After the surprise hit 'Home Alone' in 1990 took the world by storm, a sequel was bound to happen.'Home Alone 2' takes place just two years after the events in the first movie when Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) was accidentally left home alone by his family and relatives because of an argument and later had to deal with two burglars (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern) wanting to rob his house before getting arrested. Now in the sequel, Kevin is at it again except this time he's on his way to New York after getting confused during an airline station where he sees another man dressed in the same coat as his father. While Kevin's parents and relatives are worried that the hero is not in their presence, the young boy is in New York having the time of his life from spending his father's money to living in a luxury hotel at the Grand Plaza along with meeting interesting and weird characters from a homeless lady (Brenda Fricker) who feeds pigeons and later becomes his friend; then there's the hotel staff from the sinister Tim Curry as the concierge who has the smile of the Grinch to Rob Schinder as a suck-up bellboy.And if you thought that Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern) were in prison...think again. Kevin encounters the two thieves where he finds out that they want to rob a local toy store.Home Alone 2 feels like we're watching the same movie over again but in a new setting. Some of the gags are very funny when Kevin sets up his usual pranks at an abandon apartment complex, but they don't compare to the original. I didn't like how Kevin always got blamed for everything when it should have been his older brother, Buzz, taking the heat. I still had fun watching this movie, though only the first one will be played more during my Christmas season.",7,0,1,31 March 2008
Reservoir Dogs," Quentin's first attempt at movie-making!
","Reservoir Dogs was the first movie directed by Quentin Tarantino before moving on to big projects such as Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill where he uses violence, hard language and sharp dialog to keep this film on an edge.The film starts off with six gangsters with colored nicknames working for Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son (Chris Penn) where their mission is to rob a bank and make it back with the jewels. The only problem is that somebody knew about the operation in advance where the surviving members meet back at a hideout where questions must be answered and fast before they get busted.While Joe and his son run the operation, the leader of the nickname pack is Mr. White (Harvey Keital) a lowlife criminal who is confident that things will run smooth. The rest of the group is followed by Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) a motormouth who always has an opinion for everything he sees; Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) is the new criminal who befriends Mr. White; Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) is the old timer who doesn't have much to say; then there's Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino) who makes references about Madonna and her wild oral sex along with her music videos; then there's Mr. Blonde A.K.A., Vic Vega (Michael Madsen) a tough gangster with a bit of an attitude.As the gangsters hide out in a local warehouse waiting for answers and help, the premise of the film shows flashbacks of the characters before the operation starts with some of them being friends along with others joining the group because of a reputation. Scenes cut back to the present time where time is running out and things get more violent with a few bit surprises along the way.This is a classic Tarantino movie where he wants to show audience members what it's like to watch his films from hardcore violence, hip soundtracks and movie references.He still remains a master filmmaker.",10,1,3,16 February 2008
Pulp Fiction," Quentin's Masterpiece is still a classic!
","Pulp Fiction changed the way how movie buffs go to the movies; at first we had 'The Godfather' in which it dealt with how organized crime was run, then 'Taxi Driver' which showed how people can never figure out what is wrong with an individual; In 'Pulp Fiction,' what Quentin Tarantino manages to capture is how life itself is a comic book and how it affects everybody in life.The film's prologue begins with a dialog conversation between Pumpkin(Tim Roth) and Hunny Bunny(Amanda Plummer) about robberies in various places: banks, liquor stores, gas stations, etc., except that nobody ever bothers robbing a restaurant for which they are insured and that customers carry a lot of cash. After the Prologue, we are introduced to two different characters; Jules Winfeld (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent Vega (John Travolta), who are hit men in search of a briefcase by their boss Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) after being held hostage by a group of wanna-be gangsters that suffer the consequences after failing to answer questions by Jules.The second part of the story is concentrated on John Travolta's character Vincent, as a heroin user, he buys drugs off his buddy Lance(Eric Stoltz)and has to take the boss's wife Mia Wallace(Uma Thruman) out to dinner in which Vincent is uncomfortable at first until Mia forces her guest to dance with her, and that is when both characters become attracted to each other(not literary, but more like friends). After dinner, they both go back to Mia's house where she is wearing Vincent's coat and notices the heroin in his jacket and mistakes it for cocaine. Now to get his boss's girlfriend alive, Vincent seeks the help of Lance in which he tells Vincent to force a needle in her heart in order to stay alive. (I'll leave the next part for you to discover).The third story is the most weakest in my opinion, involving Bruce Willis's character Butch Coolidge, a boxer who made a bargain with Marcellus that if he loses, he gets to leave with $100,000. Unfortunately the plan backfires leaving Butch and his girlfriend on the run from the gangsters; which makes it more possible since his girlfriend forgot the watch that his father used in the war. Now with little time, Butch goes back to his apartment to get the watch and escapes from peril and sees Marcellus on the street. As Butch is trying to escape, Marcellus follows him into a pawn shop where they are capture by racist rednecks that have their fun with Marcellus...I won't be giving out anymore clues to what happens, but let me assure the readers out there, Pulp Fiction is one hell of a ride. The film not only is a Renascence towards bringing back actors such as John Travolta, but it brought a new career out of Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thruman, and the director himself, Quentin Tarantino. Backed up with a great soundtrack, and numerous references to great movies, TV Shows and the world, Pulp Fiction is a classic by my book.",10,0,1,22 June 2003
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Like a fine wine, the series is aging gracefully.
","Oh, God, where do I begin? Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth installment from the J.K. Rowling series and this one is the payoff. Not only does each of the series keep getting better by installments, but they also get darker as well. As I mention in my review of Prisoner of Azkaban, the first two installments were ways of getting gawky eyed teenage girls to the big screen; with Azkaban, it was a movie where EVERYBODY, fans and non fans, to see this flick. With Goblet of Fire, the results are more promising than ever.Daniel Radcliffe returns to his role as Harry Potter, a little older this time, and having nightmares about Lord Voldermort A.K.A. 'You Know Who', as the scar on his forehead is getting worse as he can see what his happening around Voldermort and his cronies.Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also back as Harry's friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, in which time the three characters are hitting the stages of puberty where the guys don't have a clue on how to pick up girls, while a student from another school asks Hermione to the ball on Christmas Eve. Not only does puberty hit them, but also at the same time the relationships start to hit a conflict where Harry can't count on neither one anymore.The premise of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is that every year there is a tournament called 'The Tri-Wizard Tournament' where a student from Hogwarts and two other students from different schools (Beauxbatons Academy and Durmstrang Institute) compete for the Tri-Wizard Cup, which will lead the winner eternal glory. The contestants have to be over seventeen to compete in the tournament, which involves retrieving a golden egg from a dragon, saving a loved one from the black lake, and the last part of the competition is going to an endless maze where somebody gets the Tri-Wizard Cup. The way the student is chosen is if somebody writes the name of the contestant on a piece of paper and sends it to the Goblet of Fire where the names will be drawn. Three have already been chosen, even a student from Hogwarts; but now a fourth contestant is revealedHarry Potter. Part of the clause on the contract reveals that no matter what, if the name is drawn, the player must go through all the levels, even if they die.As far from directing, Mike Newell of 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Mona Lisa Smile' is the first British director in the movie series where as a Britain, he understands everything about a boarding school, even a scene where Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman) starts to hit Harry and Ron upside the head for not doing their work. Yet, so funny and realistic that he does an outstanding job making this film.Goblet of Fire also draws strong supporting roles; there's Michael Gambon reprising his role as Dumbledor; Maggie Smith as McGonagall (more of an extended role than Azkaban), Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid, Miranda Richardson as the slimy Rita Skeeter and Brendan Gleason as 'Mad-Eyed' Moody, who is the fourth teacher in the dark arts after the three other teachers left (Prof. Quarrel was Voldermort's apprentice in the 1st movie; the fop Gilderoy Lockhart in the second movie; and the eccentric Prof. Lupin in the 3rd installment).Harry does meet his match with Lord Voldermort (Ralph Finnees) before the end of the movie which is quite a surprise, because after the first three films, the first two were apprentices in the body of Voldermort; in the third film, it was revealed that another apprentice 'Worm-Tail' Peter Pettigrew (Timothy Spall) was responsible for the death of James and Lily Potter; and now the monster is met, incomplete, with the face of the mechanical droid from the movie 'I, Robot' where Voldermort's eyes are small, his nose small and his body very alive.This is the first Harry Potter movie to be Rated PG-13, because of dark elements and scary violence. It does a job of staying true to what it means. Not to mention coming along with a storyline that people can follow. Overall, this is one hell of a movie, and as Hermione says to Ron and Harry, 'Everything is going to change.' Indeed, for the better.Acting: A+ Plot:A+ Directing:A+This is a must see for every wizard and muggle.",10,2,7,19 November 2005
Mystic River," The best American movie i have ever seen
","'We bury our sins'Clint Eastwood's 'Mystic River' is a tragic story about the past and how it can come back to haunt those again. Yet what is so interesting about Clint Eastwood's movies is that we can study the characters and actually relate to them. I think back on 'Unforgiven' where Eastwood's character William Munny was forced to do what he did after money and the death of his best friend where involved.The film's prologue shows three young boys from Boston; Jimmy, David and Sean as they play street hockey in the middle of the neighborhood, they lose the ball in the sewer and see a sidewalk filled with cement that hasn't dried and decide to write their names on the cement as a trademark. A car arrives as two old men who are pedophiles pose as cops to the three young boys and threaten to arrest them unless they go back to their parents. The cops ask young Davis on where he lives, and tells them that he lives on the other side. As a threat, they'll arrest him unless he goes with them to drop him off. The old men kidnap David for four weeks until he escapes from their cell, leaving him a burden he will carry for the rest of his life.All three men are grown up now and have different lives.Jimmy (Sean Pean) is the crook who has gone to jail already. He runs a mom and pop's store in the neighborhood where his oldest daughter (Emmy Rossum) works with him. He is also the neighborhood tough guy where two cousins from his wife (Laura Linney) are in his gang.Sean (Kevin Bacon) is on the opposite side of the law where he is a detective who can't seemed to figure out why his wife left him while she was pregnant and doesn't want to say a word over the phone.David (Tim Robbins) is still living the burden he carried when he was abused. His wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) can never seem to figure out what is wrong with him as well, just the fact that he comes home one night with a wound and a hole in the middle of his shirt.All three characters are re-united after the death of Jimmy's daughter in which Sean is the detective working on the case with his partner (Laurence Fishburne); David is consider a suspect in the murder case while Jimmy himself gets his wife's cousins to ask everybody in the neighborhood if they know anything about his daughter's murder.'Mystic River' is a story about the past coming back to haunt those who experience the pain, and now coming back to those who didn't deserve it. With top-notch acting and superb directing from Eastwood himself, 'Mystic River' proves to be a masterpiece in guilt.",10,1,3,23 February 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Our introduction to Brangelina
","Everybody knows right now that this film was the reason why Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie became a couple in the first place. That's perfect chemistry when director Doug Liman (Go) decided to cast these two actors into one action film.John (Brad Pitt) and Jane (Angelina Jolie) Smith have the beautiful life together where they both make a lot of money and live a happy life. That's just part of their day job where at night they're secret agent spies killing people left and right until they get briefings from their separate bosses that they have to kill each other. John and Jane don't know it until they meet face to face where once they don't kill each other, all havoc breaks loose where everybody wants to kill them.While the relationship is one thing between Pitt and Jolie, the action is a surprise marvel where from bullets to explosions, I was wowed with my eyes almost wanting to pop out of my sockets. I was already used to the fact that Angelina Jolie has been in action flicks thanks to the Tomb Raider movies where Brad Pitt has been in crime drama epics and yet, it's both seductive and entertaining.",8,1,3,31 March 2008
The Departed," Cops and Criminals, what's the difference?
","Taxi Driver was hailed at the movie of the seventies; Raging Bull was the film of the eighties; Good Fellas was the film of the nineties; now in this decade, Martin Scorsese returns to his mafia roots, not in New York or New Jersey, but brings his mafia to Boston where in this update of Infernal Affairs it's mean, violent, frightening with full of surprises, and Jack is Back making The Departed Martin Scorsese's definitive film of this decade.'When you're faced with a loaded gun...what's the difference?' In The Departed, Leonardo Dicaprio and Matt Damon play different sides of the law that go in the opposite directions in their careers; Leo is Billy Costigan, a smart recruit who flunked the academy but is hired by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and the foul-mouth Sgt. Dignam (Mark Whalberg) to go undercover inside mob boss Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) team and get any information; Matt is Colin Sullivan who is not only a smart prodigy to Frank, but once he is promoted to the Special Unit Investigations leaded by Capt. Ellerby (Alec Baldwin), it's up to Colin to make sure that he gives Frank the early step.In a game of cat and mouse, both sides of the law want to find out who the mole is in their operative sources while at the same time both William and Colin are taken in by the father-son figures of their work with Frank thinking of William as a son despite his henchman Mr. French (Ray Winstone) breaking him down. Just like most movies, there is always the love interest. Vera Farmiga who is unknown to a lot of general film freaks like myself plays the police psychiatrist who falls in love with Colin's Suffolk education attitude while she sees Billy as her patient and falls for both characters despite not knowing that both are undercover operatives.Everyone gives top notch performances, but everybody knows that the one who steals the show is none other than Jack Nicholson's Frank Costello. Nicholson's performance as Costello brings back the devil's grin that made everybody loved villains in the first place; compared to the sadistic Bill the Butcher from Gangs of New York, Jack's performance is one that people will be talking about and reenacting.On another note about the film, the editing of the film is top notch with Thelma Schoonmaker giving it all she's got bringing energetic life to the movie. The screenplay by William Monahan is excellent after reading the script from purchasing the two disc special edition on February 13, 2007 and this is Martin Scorsese's best film ever.",10,2,3,18 July 2007
Die Hard," One of the best action films of the 80's!
","The 1980's were probably known to a lot of fans as the best decade for movies with comedies such as Ghostbusters, Risky Business, Sixteen Candles to horror movies ranging from A Nightmare on Elm Street (classic), Friday the 13th series, The Lost Boys and Fright Night. But in terms of action movies, none come as close than the original Die Hard starring Bruce Willis as the rule bending Detective John McClane.The film starts with John McClane (Willis) going from New York to Los Angeles to be with his wife, Holly, (Bonnie Bedelia) in time for Christmas where a party is being thrown after a successful business deal inside the Nakotomi Plaza. Along the way comes a group of criminals led by Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) take control of the party having hostages along with McClane's character in hiding so he can figure out what the hell to do in order to save everybody including his wife. What Hans wants along with his thugs is six-hundred million dollars locked inside the vault where it's going to take a miracle besides passwords to get the money.With McClane battling some of the thugs, he calls upon the authority to see what they can do in order to help and while Sgt. Al Powell (Reginald VelJohnson) seems to understand what's going on with the fighting New York cop, the other members of authority figures (S.W.A.T., FBI,) can't do a damn thing right where somebody either gets killed or shot.'Die Hard' is true action glory where not only are the attack sequences choreograph so well done, but the early special effects are a knock out compared to some of the technology today, not to mention the lack of real actors who'd do whatever it takes to make the scenes in movies real along with seeing a serious side to Bruce Willis besides him being a funny actor.Classic!",10,1,3,14 January 2008
Psycho," A pretty good damn movie
","Everybody knows the famous score; everybody knows the villain and most people know what kind of man Norman Bates is like.Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who robs a sum of forty-thousand dollars before driving through the California state with almost being caught by her boss and the employer she robbed the money from to the cop that pulls her over. Marion then wonders more into the state where during her departure not only does she get a new car to be incognito but stays at the Bates Motel where Norman Bates comes out and sees that she's by herself and needs company. To Marion, she thinks Norman is just a nice guy until the voices from the house start to ring where maybe something isn't right after all.And that's where it all begins.I love Hitchcock's 'Psycho' as a thriller, but I don't get why people are calling it a great horror movie just because of the shower scene and Norman dressing like his mother. I think of Psycho as a crime/thriller/drama film where people need to understand that Marion committed a crime of stealing the money and after her death in the film, her disappearance along with the money is still involved when the detective starts questioning those involved with Marion about her whereabouts.This is the only Hitchcock movie where I can't keep my eyes off for one damn minute.",9,0,1,27 May 2008
War of the Worlds," Despite neat special effects and terror, it's not the best alien flick
","The first time that Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise teamed up to make a movie together with Minority Report (2002), it really put them on the map where from dazzling special effects to a good story line proving that you can have a top actor and a top director making one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.Spielberg and Cruise second time is really more flat like a soda than the first.'War of the Worlds', based on the famous Orson Welles radio broadcast that left the world in a frenzy is on the big screen. It's Steven Spielberg's third time around making 'alien' pictures after his first attempt in the 1970's flick Close Encounters of the Third Kind (the best in my opinion) where it showed how something out of the ordinary can be something amazing to everybody. In 1982, Steven brought the 'awe' back in movie experience by making E.T. (The Extra Terrestrial) where it showed that an unlikely bond between an alien and an outcast child. Now Steven is back but bringing more menace to his aliens than the cute creatures.Tom Cruise is Ray Ferrier, a divorce father who sees his children whenever the wife (Miranda Otto) needs something. His children are played by Justin Chatwin and the talented Dakota Fanning in which they don't seem to fond of their father once they arrive to spend the weekend with them. It's all moaning and argument until something happens in the skies leaving all of the citizens in New Jersey to wonder what's happening before an alien invasion takes place. People are being hit with laser beams and buildings being destroyed while Tom Cruise and his kids try to get away from everything as possible.It becomes too annoying when Spielberg makes too many references about 9/11 from a frame photograph of Tom Cruise's character and the family of the twin towers in the background along with the American flags we see at each house to the references of the attacks from the rubble, the destroyed planes and so forth. Dakota Fanning is a wonderful actress but her screaming had to make me want to get ear plugs after one too many screams made me want to hit myself with a pillow.But despite what I wrote in my last paragraph, I'm still recommending this movie as a thriller where the special effects along with the tension music from John Williams (a Spielberg regular) doesn't make this film so bad to watch.Not the best alien flick I've ever seen, but it's entertainment.",7,2,5,31 March 2008
Scream 2," Someone's Back Out For Revenge!
","Scream 2 is the sequel to the 1996 box-officer sleeper hit where somebody is emulating Sidney Prescott's killer and going after people left and right.It's been a year since the Woodsboro incident with Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in college where she thinks her problems have gone away while starting a new life...Think again.After reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) gained rights for her book to become a hit where she hears about a killer attacking college kids in the same community where Sydney lives, she goes to the school with reporters wanting a piece of the dish before reuniting with the original victims from Sydney, Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy). She brings a surprise, Cotton Weary (Liev Schriber), as a way for him and Sydney to reunite for an interview that Gail promises the innocent victim (Cotton).Students are being killed left and right just as time is running out for Sydney and the others to find out who the killer is and why.'Scream 2' follows the movie patterns that most movie sequels follow: 1.) The body count is always bigger; 2.) The death scenes are much more elaborate; and three? You're going to figure it out for yourself.The film itself is not as creepy unlike the original but much more lighthearted besides the fact that the death scenes are gruesome. It was really great to see how Wes Craven can make a sequel of a franchise without having to ruin the fun or making it less weaker to the film's original counterpart.",8,4,6,19 February 2008
Jaws," I'd think twice before going to the beach on summer vacation
","1975 introduced 'Jaws' where not only did it make Steven Spielberg a star as a director but made blockbuster history where we'd never thought nature would bring fear to a whole new world.The film starts out with a pair of young people who meet at the beach while everybody else is having a good time. The young love birds decide to go skinny dipping on the beach where after the young guy falls flat on the sand beaches too drunk to follow, his female companion goes into the cold water in the dark where she swims out too far before feeling something underwater and being pulled under to her death.The next morning Amity police chief Brody (Roy Schinder) gets a phone call about the missing girl before heading to the beach. He meets up with the young lover's boy not until they see that what remains on the beach is parts of the victim where she's been devoured to death. Nobody believes Chief Brody that it was a shark attack as the mayor (Murry Hamilton) and everybody else hides it until an incident at the beach claims a boy's life where he's eaten in whole.With a reward at stake and a funeral to be arrange, all the shark hunters including local tough guy Quint (Robert Shaw) want a piece of the action to kill the animal; however Quint doesn't want a name for himself since he's already got a rep for demanding too much including getting all of the money the town makes in tourism and other stuff. Also invited on board is marine biologist Matt Hopper (Richard Dreyfuss) who is not convinced that the shark the first hunters killed is the actual beast where he's still on the loose.It's not until the mayor decides to open up the beach on The Fourth of July weekend where the shark returns to the kitchen to get more snacks and almost killing Chief Brody's eldest son where it now becomes a personal vendetta for the chief where he hires Quint and Hooper to go after the shark. From there 'Jaws' becomes an adventure filled with energy and thrills to make you jump out of your seat and go back for more.I bet it'll make you think twice before going to the beaches.",10,1,3,18 August 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Saving the Best for last
","This is the one where all 'Star Wars' fans have been waiting for. It has been six years since the first prequel came out, where many people were so hyped up about it that they were left disappointed because the hero was cute and Jar-Jar was an annoying S.O.B.; part 2 came out in 2002, though I didn't watch the film for personal reasons, people were somewhat lukewarm about the story and dialog as the action sequences were the reason to see the films; now in the grand finale, George Lucas has put audiences back where not only does he blend in special effects, but there is no holding back when it comes to the fight scenes in which every main character is involve.The film starts off with the first word beginning the prologue: 'War!' in which that's what we see in the beginning of the film. A battle in space is lead by Jedi's Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi as they try to rescue supreme chancellor Palpatine, who is being held captive by alien/creature General Grievous on a ship, in which Count Dooku makes a return for his final battle with Anakin and Obi-Wan, as Palpatine requests that Anakin chops off Dooku's head, while Obi-Wan is unconscious; yet, he does chop off the sith's head off where as all three of them leave escaping the exploding ship.Anakin's rage starts to grow when he continues to have bad thoughts, but there not about his mother, but about Padme's pregnancy for which he thinks his dreams might turn real. It turns out worse when Palpatine tells Anakin about the secrets of the dark path for which he coaxes Anakin about helping his wife to betray every member of the Jedi council. This leaves him to kill members of both the good and the evil, in which some of them are Younglings (young Jedi kids).Yes, some people might complain about the dialog, but the action sequences remain the true force of the Star Wars saga as from one scene after another, we see Jedi's in battle, wookies (Yes, I've said it) blowing up stuff as they help the Jedi's in fight; Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and other Jedi knights battle Palpatine (who reveals himself as Darth Sidious) in which every Jedi knight dies, all of the clones from the sequel movie who helped them are turned against the Jedi knights for which not only do they shoot them, but are working for the future Darth Vader. The last battle between Obi-Wan and Anakin is something for fans to remember.There are no secrets kept in this review, as you pretty much know what happens next that Amidala dies giving birth to Luke and Leia as Bail Organa (Jimmy Smits) adopts Leia, while Yoda tells Obi-Wan that not only will both former Jedi knights be separated, but Luke will have to be left in Tatooine where Obi-Wan will finish his training with Qui-Gon's spirit while protecting Luke, not to mention the beginning of the construction of The Death Star for 'A New Hope' 'Revenge of the Sith' is a grand promise to a great franchise for which everything was saved the best for last did come true. Though the film is much darker than any film of the series, including 'Empire Strikes Back and Attack of the Clones,' there is no doubt that fans will want to miss this one, because this is the ride that we all have been waiting for.",10,3,12,19 May 2005
Ray," A Great Movie!
","I just bought the DVD yesterday and I got to say that the film is excellent in every aspect. Jamie Foxx plays the legendary Ray Charles who was born blind at a young age and had to adapt to the current situation, and just watching Jamie play the character made you believe that he was Ray Charles; from the way he moves to playing the piano, I was just thrilled. Also the storyline helped me understand what went on during the life of Ray Charles, from being banned from the state of Georgia for a short while; having different relationships with women; and creating music that will stick with fans of his forever. As much as I liked 'La Bamba' and 'The Buddy Holly Story,' 'Ray' was something special to me, and will be talked about for years to come.",10,1,2,5 February 2005

WALL·E," No words can describe how majestic this film is
","Just days after the 2008 Academy Awards announced the winners, I had to see the best animation feature winner 'Wall-E' in which all of my young cousins and nieces and their parents have seen this film and commented on it being wonderful making me the outcast of the bunch.'Wall-E' takes place in the distant future where Earth has been destroyed due to the lack of care the people never gave into cleaning the trash making it a pile of ruins. All is left on Earth besides empty stores is a pile of junk rubble made into cubicles and set into buildings while a robot named Wall-E tries to make his 'Earth' the way it was before the human population became extinct. There are no other creatures or animals with the exception of a cockroach that Wall-E considers a companion where the robot uses an abandon ship as his home filled with various toys and devices; the small robot uses an I-pod to watch a musical in which Wall-E tries to emulate the scene.Later in the film, another robot named EVE enters the absent Earth where Wall-E finds contact of his kind for the first time after years of being isolated that he tries his best to win her heart. Even though their only way of communication is by saying their names to one another along with certain one words, the two robots share a relationship where I had tears and a smile on my face. But what Wall-E doesn't know is that EVE was sent to look for a living organism (a plant) and sent it back to space to show that there is life on Earth. So Wall-E follows EVE to space with their adventure just beginning.'Wall-E' is something for everybody. It may be a Pixar movie for kids and Disney fans to watch, but there's more to this film than just a kids movie or a Disney film. The film is everything for sci-fi fans to talk about, those who care for the environment (a later subplot in the film), or yet, those who love watching romantic movies where Wall-E and EVE are the first screen couple that aren't human and yet, I really felt an attraction to them as I cried during their scenes.It's that good and so wonderful that it should have deserved the best picture nomination.",10,2,4,12 March 2009
The Shawshank Redemption," 'Everybody's Innocent. Didn't you know that?'
","1994 was surely a memory of great movies. From blockbuster epics like Speed proving to audience that young actors like Keanu Reeves can dominate the spotlight to The Lion King where mixing Shakespeare with animation can be a triumph. It was also the year of memorable movies from 'Forrest Gump' where retards and idiots can make a difference; 'Pulp Fiction' was a wild ride filled with violence and language to make you have nightmares; 'Quiz Show' questioned the stunts on game shows; 'Four Weddings and A Funeral' proved to be a barrel of laughs and 'The Shawshank Redemption' proves that drama takes place in all sides and all directions.The films I placed in quotations where nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1995. 'Gump' was the big winner taking home more awards and proving that a person of idiocy and a strong heart can change a person's life; 'Pulp' won the original screenplay making Tarantino a star; 'Quiz Show' and 'Funerals' had less nominations but no wins. 'Shawshank' is remembered for being a small movie with so many nominations that it didn't receive one award! Not One! There's a thing with certain movies where once they became failures, they become cult classics. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies.Based on the novel by Stephen King, the film starts in the late 1940's about a hot shot banker by the name of Andy Dufrense (a superb Tim Robbins) who comes home drunk one night before finding his wife along with another man dead. By the time the cops arrive, they see that Andy has a gun with several bullets on the floor. They arrest him, but Andy didn't commit the crime where after a trial hearing, he is sent to Shawshank prison where his sentence is double life; one for each of his victims.Andy is the fresh meat in Shawshank along with a couple of new inmates where they meet with Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), one real mean S.O.B. who believes in two things: Discipline and the bible. Norton's right hand man Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) is the true shark of the institution where prisoners think of the warden as child's play compared to the captain who harasses all of the inmates. Andy meets several old inmates from Ellis Boyd Redding, or Red (played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman), who's doing time from murder where he's the inmates right hand man in terms of getting items from toothpicks to cigarettes and knowing everything about everyone. There's also Brooks (James Whitmore), the old-timer who plays an important part of the prison where everybody looks up to him. As each decade passes, Andy gets the prison involved in several little projects from helping the warden along with the guards and staff with their taxes to creating a public library for the prisoners where secrets are being kept from the hero. There's even a new inmate who enters Shawshank in the 1960's who knows the truth about Andy being set-up. Only time will tell when Andy will be released from prison along with having one of the most satisfying climaxes in movie or jail history.This movie really deserves all the attention it earns.",10,0,0,20 March 2008
Platoon," The only TRUE Vietnam movie
","I have to say that Platoon is a one of a kind masterpiece. Oliver Stone who was in Vietnam wanted audience to get a view of how unscrouplous American soldiers were. The film stars Charlie Sheen as the young recruit that notices the insanity of the U.S. soldiers. 'instead of us fighting the enemy, we were fighting ourselves,' Charlie Sheen says in the film. Platoon also stars Willem Dafoe as Ellis, the stoner but cool character and Tom Barenger in his infamous role as Sgt. Barnes, the soldier that couldn't be stop. The film was great and emotional and showed audiences that american soldiers couldn't be consider heroes.

Scream," The film that resurrected the horror genre
","People go to the movies for lots of reasons: they want to escape from reality, they want to learn a lesson other than education, they want inspiration, or something they want to talk about. Horror movies were dead in the early nineties where we didn't have characters that can scare us, but that made us laugh. Not only were people in America were starting to label video games but actually went to family movies rather than horror movies. Scream is a resurrection of the horror movies, where the film itself is a parody of horror movies and understanding the rules of who lives and who dies.The film's prologue begins with Drew Barrymore as a driven sex teenager who gets an anonymous phone call from a mysterious man that says he's going to kill her and her boyfriend if she doesn't cooperate with his scheme. They play movie trivia on horror movies where if she answers one right, the game continues, if she answers wrong, he dies. The boyfriend dies either way, so now it's up to Drew Barrymore's character to escape or die; the killer appears in a black costume with a white mask along with a sharp knife chasing her and than mutilating her body.We move on to the film's hero Sidney Prescott, (Neve Campbell of 'Party of Five') an average high school bookworm who hasn't lost her virginity yet as her boyfriend Billy Loomis wants her to open up to him (you know what I mean); her father is leaving on a trip for the week, leaving Sidney by herself since her mom has died.The next day, its total chaos at Woodsboro High where reporters are all over the incident, questioning students, teachers or anybody who knew the death of Drew Barrymore's character and her boyfriend. Even Sidney's friends Tatum (Rose McGowan), Steward (Matthew Lillard), and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the movie freak, find it all to be a big horror movie.One night, Sidney receives a call from an anonymous stranger and asking her what is her favorite scary movie. It's a dark and raspy voice just like the film's prologue where we don't know who the person is. It's the same murderer who killed Drew Barrymore's character and is now after her; Sidney escapes this time but the killer will return again.To quote Randy: 'Everybody's a suspect!' Indeed the whole town is suspected after Billy Loomis had been taken in by authorities, because of a cellular phone he carried. Now a curfew has been placed, with people getting killed one by one, especially a new clue involving the anniversary on the death of Sidney's mother. The final showdown is taken place at Steward's house where the mysterious murderer is revealed with a twisted ending.'Scream' is not a horror movie, in general, but a homage where everything we see is a reference to most of the popular movies from 'Evil Dead,' 'Halloween,' 'A Nightmare on Elm Street,' 'When A Stranger Calls,' 'Psycho,' and many more. Nonetheless, this a popcorn treat that I wouldn't recommend going to the bathroom after wards.",10,0,0,16 May 2005
Halloween," A Fright from Start to Finish
","Halloween is one of my favorite days of the year. Sure, it's not a holiday where people take a day off from work, but I loved the atmosphere where kids and adults alike dress up in scary costumes and get candy or scare people for that matter. In John Carpenter's Halloween, this is more of a treat than a trick.The film's prologue begins on Haddonfield, Illinois 1963 where it's just an ordinary Halloween night like no other. Except for little Michael Myers who happens to be coming home when he catches his sister Judith making out on the couch with her boyfriend and then goes upstairs to have sex for which Michael goes into the house and takes a butcher knife and waits for the boyfriend to leave to make his kill on his older sister. His parents come home and see little Michael dressed in a clown suit with a butcher knife with blood on it. With the ominous music of John Carpenter, the suspense has just begun.Fifteen years later, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) has pleaded with the courts to take a catatonic Myers to a maximum-security prison where he feels that the staff will at least try to watch over him. During the entrance of the minimum prison, an adult Myers attacks the nurse and escapes in the car leaving Loomis more in a panic than ever in his life as 'The Evil' has gone.It's Halloween 1978, and everything is pitch perfect in Haddonfield where not a murder has occurred since 1963. The neighborhood kids called the old Myers house 'The Spook house' where many people (even adults) feel the presence of Michael Myers hiding somewhere in the house. The new character in the movie is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), an average American girl who has ambitions of going to college, but at the same time baby-sits in order to make cash for herself, as her father is a realtor, he even asks her to put the key under the old Myers house. Laurie's friends are Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Loomis) who are partygoers than she is, and want to hook Laurie with a boyfriend for the school homecoming after Halloween. At the same time, a man dressed in a William Shatner mask is stalking all three girls with Laurie trying to figure out who could it be.Loomis is on the run looking for Michael Myers as it becomes hopeless that nobody will ever listen to him, except for Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) who decides to help Loomis look for him.The night of terror is about to beginÂ… as Myers has found the neighborhood where Laurie and Annie are babysitting two different kids. He haunts them and kills a dog to cover his distraction.I've given away so much of the plot, that I can't go on any further. One thing about Halloween that most critics (Gene Siskel, Richard Corliss) talked about was how the villain stalked their victims during premarital sex, which is now common for a lot of horror flicks (Freddy Krugger, Jason, Pinhead) where the virgin lives and the sluts' die. Are these psychopathic men working for the pope and God? Overall, Halloween is a masterpiece that once again resurrected the pleasures of going to see a horror film; I wouldn't recommend watching this film alone or in the dark.",10,0,1,15 March 2004
Shrek," A Parody of Delight
","'Shrek' is a great movie on every aspect; though animated, the characters look twice as real than any other cartoon character or CGI character for that matter. It's also a cruel movie poking fun at all of those 'soft' Walt Disney characters that people cherish in their time; now with the DreamWorks film, Shrek is a one of a kind and introducing a new hero and supporting characters.The synopsis of 'Shrek' involves a seven foot green ogre who calls himself Shrek terrifies the people in the village. The beast has signs telling people to stay out of his swamp in which villagers want him dead, but yet, he's so harmless that in the prologue of the film, he reads 'Sleeping Beauty' in the restroom, takes a bath in the swamp, brushes his teeth with goo and lives in an abandon rock house. In the film, he tells a creature that he is rejected by society.To those who recognize Shrek's voice, that is Mike Myers of 'Saturday Night Live' fame and from the 'Wayne's World' series. Though the original actor was intended for the late Chris Farley, Mike brings a presence to the jolly green giant in which not only do we laugh with the character, but we feel for him as well.Lord Farquea, (voice by John Lithgow) who resembles Disney CEO John Eisner, wants to get rid of every single fairy tale creature living in DuLac and the only way he does is by cutting off the legs of the Gingerbread Man and torturing him by drowning him in a vase of milk. As part of his quest, he wants to marry a princess in order to become king and during a parody of 'Love Connection,' the magic mirror points out Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) out of Snow White, Sleeping Beauty and Cinderella.Now all of the fairy tale creatures are captured by Lord Farquea's men and are paying those who have those creatures; we see the three bears, the three little pigs, the seven dwarfs, and Pinocchio in cages. There is one creature who manages to escape and that is Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a talkative donkey that never really shuts up, but in the end is always right. He is saved by Shrek after being chased by the guards and decides to stick with him, though Shrek didn't say anything, now Donkey wants to live with Shrek though the green creature wants peace and quiet.To skip the rest of the story, Shrek and Donkey decide to go after Farquea and go rescue Princess Fiona in order for Shrek to keep his land. Along the way, we get to see the comedy and relationship between Donkey and Shrek, like Abbott and Castello where no matter what situation comes between them they are a duo.'Shrek' is a funny movie that I will leave the rest of the film for viewers to see; it almost reminds me of 'Young Frankenstein' in which the parody and jokes were subtle, though it has the cruelness of 'Blazing Saddles' (relax, they're no slurs) I still enjoy 'Shrek'.",10,2,4,17 March 2005
Iron Man," I didn't expect this movie to be so awesome!
","Marvel comics has unleashed superhero movies from The Spider-Man Trilogy, The X-Men Trilogy, The Hulk films, The Fantastic Four films, The Punisher, Blade, and Ghost Rider, where now the metallic superhero Iron Man makes his screen debut.To be honest, I didn't know too much about Anthony Stark and his alter ego Iron Man since I was into Spider-Man, the X-Men and Hulk. But once I slipped on the DVD, I got more than I bargain for.Robert Downey Jr. portrays smart technician billionaire and media lover Tony Stark who's gone off to Iraq in showing the army the latest weapons he created until being captured by the enemy. While being a prisoner, he must make the weapons or else he'll be killed off; his heart has been transplanted by a ball device where if it's taken off his chest, he'll die instantly. As a prisoner, Tony gets help from another prisoner by creating a metallic suit to shield himself as he escapes from the underground caves and later thinks about how with his inventions he can get rid of evil after learning that his weapons were not only used by the U.S. army but by the Iraq soldiers as well.It's fun to watch Downey Jr.'s character as Stark trying to reinvent the machine and at the same time learning from his mistakes that nobody's perfect. His performance is a balanced of comedy and serious technique like watching Bill Murray in Ghostbusters. Tony Stark/Iron Man is a good comeback for Robert Downey Jr. who's really had a bit of ups and downs in the past years of his career, but he finally found the right character at last.Jon Favreau (Swingers) directs the film balancing a sense of reality along with mixing humor, action, a bit of romance, adventure, screw-ups, and thrills along the way. Other than Downey Jr. in the film, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Stark's assistant Pepper Potts who isn't a damsel in distress compared to most leading ladies but a tough cookie who knows everything about her employer and speaks the truth. Terrance Howard plays Stark's friend Col. James Rhodes who'll back him up in anyway while making sure that the billionaire doesn't do anything to screw up. And there's Jeff Bridges who plays Obidiah Stane, Stark's business partner with a few secrets of his own.To conclude, Iron Man rocks in every way! Just be sure to stick around after the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo performance as Nick Fury.",9,8,11,13 October 2008
The Deer Hunter," An emotional film that doesn't make you think about war
","but about the human spirit and how it is fragile. Compared to Platoon where American soldiers weren't heroes, The Deer Hunter is about a group of friends that serve their duty in Vietnam and during the war, they are capture prisoners and that's when two out of three soldiers lose their emotions. Robert De Niro is superb in this war drama that really isn't about war. Christopher Walken who took best supporting actor got my attention.

Speed," What a beautiful rush!
","Pop quiz movie viewers: How do you declare one of the most sophisticated action movies of the early nineties? Awesome! Jan De Bont's 'Speed' is a thriller of all angles in which you have to keep guessing in the intense scenes on what is going to happen next. Sometimes you'll be right while in other moments you'll be forced to cover your mouths and gasps at the curtain surprises.The film's beginning prologue introduces sadistic madman Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet) trying to accomplishment one of his life scheming goals: blow up a bomb in an elevator. On the outside, SWAT members Jack Travers (Keanu Reeves) and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) arrive and try to deter the elevator from falling before Payne realizes that somebody is trying to stop his plan.Payne's plan fails before he comes up with another solution. Since he figures that Detective Travers is up for a challenge, Payne places another bomb on a bus where if it drops below 50 miles per hour, the vehicle will detonate on sight. It turns up to be a cat and mouse game for Travers as he gets on the bus and tries to figure out how to dismantle the bomb and figure out how Payne knows everything in advance.What makes 'Speed' such a fantastic movie besides the action scenes include it's top cast. No longer do we need action heroes like Stallone or Arnold to show their huge muscles where we have young talented actors like Keanu Reeves proving that he can flex his acting abilities besides being in Bill and Ted. Dennis Hopper is one mad S.O.B., in which his character has more smarts and surprises than any villain I had seen in 1994. Sandra Bullock plays Annie, one of the bus passengers, who would later be a successful actress in the big screens.Truly, one of the best action pictures of the 1990's.",10,3,5,24 February 2008
X2: X-Men United," A rarity of a sequel in which you don't have to watch the original to experience
","X2: X-Men United shares the tradition of Aliens, Dawn of the Dead and The Lost World: Jurassic Park as a sequel far superior than their original counterparts. If i had words to describe this movie, and that is 'Ultimate Bad-Ass.' The film doesn't waste any time with getting to know the characters as a mutant known as Nightcrawler (A.K.A. Kurt Wagner, played by Alan Cumming) goes on an attack in The White House almost succeeding in killing the president until being deter by an agent. It is then where humans want to do something to efface the gifted mutants from the face of the world by brining in William Stryker (Brian Cox) to capture and illuminate those who have powers.From the first movie, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) returns from the Alkalide Base in Canada where he discovers that there was nothing left; everything had been deserted. He goes back to the mansion/school in New York to see that nothing has change with the fellow X-Men members Storm (Halle Berry), Jean Gray (Famke Jansen), Cyclops (James Marsden), even Rogue (Anna Paquin) has accepted herself in the school of the gifted. Wolverine learns from Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that not only is Magneto (Ian McKellan) in a facility, but there is a mutant that almost killed the president.The X-Men leave Wolverine to take care of the young students where Jean and Storm head up to Boston to meet with Nightcrawler just as Scott and Prof. Xavier meet with Magneto where the head teacher discovers that Stryker has met with the fellow nemesis and giving all the details about the mansion full of mutants. Later that night, Stryker sends his team to capture a few of the students with Wolverine saving a couple of students including Rogue, her boyfriend Iceman and buddy Pyro. With the mutant registration in place, mutants from all sides unite to fight for civilization and the right to live.X2: X-Men United has more heart pound suspense and savvy action than it's original predecessor. Fans do get to see Wolverine slice and dice things up more than in the first movie; but the real treat however is Alan Cumming's portrayal of the demon Nightcrawler for which everything from the German accent to the design of the creature will have fans talking about him for ages to come.",10,0,0,17 November 2003
The Sixth Sense," I really, really tried to like this movie.
","But the problem was with the director's choice of inspiration.M. Night Shyamalan started with what could've been a classic in my book, until i saw the whole package and realized that it was just too familiar. It was in 1999 when I saw the movie with my father and we had gotten into the film from the shocks; Haley Joel Osment is such a talented actor that he truly deserved the Academy Award for the best supporting male role. Bruce Willis did much in this drama as the psychologist trying to help Haley Joel's character, which shows a rather different approach than him killing bad guys as John McClain.My complaint had to be the infamous ending where when i saw it in theater, I recognized immediately that Shyamlan took the idea of an episode from the Nickelodeon show 'Are you afraid of the Dark?' called The Tale of the Dream Girl using the same premise. Yet, the director got a nomination for original screenplay that he never mentioned his so called 'Inspiration' to anybody.Haley, don't stop acting in dramatic movies; M. Night, don't based your movies on TV plots next time.",4,2,5,19 February 2008

","I saw the last epic in the lord of the ring series and it was wonderful. The story finishes with Sam and Frodo going to the fire of Modor to destroy the ring, the humans continue to fight for middle earth as they find Pippen and Merry safe. The special effects are awesome, the film remains one of the best pictures of 2003 with a top notch cast, cool storytelling, badass fight sequences and something for you to smile. The Return of the King is twice as sad than the first two from the series so carry a tissue with you. Since third times a charm, maybe it will finally win best picture for the 2004 Oscars.

","And I'm not talking about no stinking Santa Claus! I'm talking about Freddy Krugger, the king of 80's horror! The original 'Nightmare On Elm Street' is still considered a modern masterpiece of horror where for once, I didn't get no sleep at night. I remember watching the original film back in Halloween of 2000 where I thought that Freddy Krugger had gotten me until my dad woke me up to see if I was okay. Luckily, there weren't any bruises or cuts on me before leaving to school the next day.Starting on my review.Wes Craven's 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' is about a group of kids led by Nancy (Heather Lagenkamp) where her friends have one thing in common: They see the same guy in their dreams. Freddy Krugger looks like a burned piece of meat after coming out of the fire where he wears a red and green stripe sweater and has long knives as fingernails and chases his victims when they're asleep giving them a souvenir. One night, Nancy invites her friends for a sleepover where one of them is brutally attacked by the monster himself where nobody believes Nancy or her pals about the incident.To this day, A Nightmare on Elm Street scares the living crap out of me where every night before I go to bed, I try to tell myself that it's only a movie.Sweet dreams, everybody!",10,9,10,22 February 2008
The Matrix," Breathtaking!
","What would you do if you found out that the real world you lived in wasn't what it seemed? In the spring of 1999, 'The Matrix' popped into theaters where prior to showing how computers can play a role in people's lives, the movie introduced fans dazzling special effects that would change the film-making industry with dozens of directors and hundreds of inspiring young artists wanting a piece of the action.Keanu Reeves plays Anderson, who goes by the name of Neo on the Internet, a computer hacker who's trying to find out about a character named Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). He digs deeper before he realizes that a group of agents led by Smith (Hugo Weaving) capture him and use him to see if he can spill any information about Morpheus. Anderson refuses before being set up by the agents in one horrifying scene that I can't even describe as we speak.Later Anderson is telephoned by Morpheus to meet with his crew where the hacker meets with his idol face to face.Neo gets more than he bargains for while hearing Morpheus explaining that a war was going in the world between freedom fighters like themselves to those opposing (the agents). He later sees that the way they work is through computers where they're hooked behind a plug and like a computer, information gets put into them from action, weapon and vehicle handling and more.'The Matrix' is not only a grand special effects extravaganza, but it uses everything both old and new from philosophy, western spaghetti (cowboy movies), Kung-Fu, and breaking time dimension where scenes run in slow motion. It's so shocking that it's one of the few Sci-Fi movies where you feel that you need to pay attention to.",10,0,1,22 February 2008
Casino," The Town Will Never Be The Same
","After films such as Cape Fear and The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese returns to his roots where this would be the final film of Scorsese's mob trilogy (his first two were Mean Streets and GoodFellas) before his prequel (Gangs of New York) in which we get to see Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent in their last collaboration with Martin Scorsese before adding DiCaprio to the mix. Life in Las Vegas will never be the same.The film's prologue has Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (De Niro) going to his car where he narrates about sacrifices about love, than his car blows up leaving him flying in the air. After the credits have rolled with his body flying, we get to see Rothstein before his death smoking a cigarette where he narrates about how he ran things very successfully and that he was a bookie who changed the odds for everybody; also we are introduced to characters from Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) who is Ace's best friend watching his back and says they screwed up the whole plan to take over the casinos; Ace's wife Ginger (Sharon Stone) is shown as innocent until we get to know her later as a street hustler who robs men for their money and hangs out with her old pimp boyfriend Lester Diamond (James Woods).The film is very different from GoodFellas and Mean Streets were both films talked about the territory of the mafia life such as nobody dating anybody different than their races; murders becoming an exception; damaging things when somebody doesn't pay; etc. Casino is more of a document on how organized crime controls what goes on in Las Vegas. It shows people in the account room counting money; all of the managers, dealers and bosses watching one another to see if they are doing their job, rob the rich people, take care of the high officials in the city and make sure that nobody tries to cheat in the casinos.The character of Rothstein is a genius in terms of trying to take people's money and helping others get money. After his character is in charge of The Tangiers, Nicky narrates on how Sam got information on what went on with sports; he find out if the quarterback got his wife knocked up, if they did cocaine, crooked referees, even the wind velocity for the field goals. Nicky says, 'The boys back home didn't care if he enjoyed himself because Sam was a cash register. All they had to do was ring the bell and take the money.' The character of Nicky Santoro is like Pesci's Tommy DeVito from 'GoodFellas' where they are volatile when not doing things their way. We see that in Nicky's character when a patron is verbally abusing Sam when all Sam asked was if the pen next to him was his, Nicky stabs the guy in the neck until the patron starts wheezing. Sam explains, 'No matter how big somebody is, Nicky would take'em on.' His appearance in Las Vegas worries Sam because he was going to be taking care of Sam along with his partner, Frank Marino (Frank Vincent) for which they scare most of the people away from Las Vegas and play their own game.Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) has been a call girl all her life for which she steals chips from her Iranian boyfriend while having a camera zooming in on her and is being watched by Rothstein. He goes to the craps table where he sees Ginger wanting more money from the boyfriend and than tosses the chips to the floor where Rothstein has fallen in love with the call girl. 'In Vegas,' he says 'for a girl like Ginger, love costs money.' Indeed it does, as Ginger robs Rothstein like Peggy would rob Al on 'MarriedÂ…With Children' where she would take his money, when telling him that she is going to play some slots; Ginger also gets most of the employees on their knees as she drugs Andy Stone (comedian Alan King), one of the people working with the mafia; and gets most of the casino workers to give her things as long as she covers them; from clothes and cars, she had everything except her old boyfriend Lester Diamond who was a hustler stealing people for cash.In a movie full of serious actors, there are three comedians playing supporting characters in this crime drama; Alan King is Andy Stone has I had mentioned, he works for the mafia in which he has conversations with them about how they should control Vegas; Don Rickles plays Billy Sherbert, the Casino manager who doesn't do much except waddle around and gets hit by Nicky; Phillip Green is played by Kevin Pollock in which his character is more of the reticent for which he can't do anything or say anything just because the teamsters gave him 62,700,00 dollars, it didn't mean anything as long as he pretended to be somebody big.As much as performances go, the spotlight belongs to Sharon Stone in a great performance. Sharon has often portrayed the lured of affection for which we see her take her clothes off or try to appeal in a sexual situation. In Casino, she plays the character very mature and most likely will be her only serious performance; she'll be herself once we stop watching this film. Another spotlight belongs to Joe Pesci who won his Oscar for GoodFellas, yet he steals the show as a main character instead of a supporting character for which he gets to tell the point of view.Casino proves to be another hit in the Martin Scorsese collection with an awesome soundtrack as its own theme, performances that shine, and bad guys that people like to root for.",10,1,1,12 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Great Adventure!
","Before special effects movies like 'Jurassic Park,' 'The Lord of the Rings,' and 'The Matrix' sagas become something of a phenomenon where their works were in CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery), George Lucas introduced us to something never done before in the history of cinema. Though I wasn't born in May of 1977 when the film first premiered, twenty years later when I was in the seventh grade, I forced my older brother to take me out with his girlfriend and her brother and sister and see a movie together, and the Star Wars Trilogy were the movies indeed at Northwest Theater.'Star Wars' is something out of the ordinary where after the 20th Century Fox logo, we see the movie logo appear on screen before us with the music of John Williams blasting its way to the screen and reading the situation of what's happening in the film. The film begins with a ship of rebels carrying Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) on their way to Alderine where a ship behind them is attacking them with lasers; a duel laser fight as the rebel ship is being invaded with storm troopers killing off the soldiers as Darth Vader, (David Prowse in costume with James Earl Jones's voice) a man with a black helmet and overalls for which his presence is meant to scare all of us (and yet he remains a classic with people of all ages and personalities). He wants the plans to Alderine as he holds Princess Leia hostage while her two droids C-3PO and R2-D2 have escaped on the pod taking them to another planet called Tatooine where they are slaves to Jawa's (aliens who own a pawn shop full of robots) until a young farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his Uncle Owen decide to buy the droids and use them.With great ambitions, Luke wants to train in the fleet academy where many rebel pilots are trained and fly X-Wing's. But his Uncle and Aunt refuse because there aren't enough people to work on the farm, leaving Luke in disappointment. He has heard rumors about Obi-Wan Kenobi and the Jedi Knights who protected the galaxy at one point, but Kenobi has never came out of his shell and is tired of hearing stories, even about his father who served as a Jedi Knight.Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) shows himself when spies attack Luke and C-3PO after losing R2-D2. Obi-Wan tells Luke about the Jedi Knights and how they protected most of the galaxies in the world; even shows Luke a light saber, an energy sword with a light as the blade that can cut through any objects from walls to human flesh. Luke even finds out about his father being in the Jedi before he turned to the dark side.Luke, Obi-Wan and the droids return to Uncle Owen's house where his uncle, aunt, the townspeople and the Jawa's are dead and is revealed that anybody who talked to R2 and C-3PO were eliminated. With nobody left in his family, Luke and the droids join Obi-Wan where they head into the town of Tatooine where it's full of gamblers, mercenaries, everything people consider 'evil.' But in order to get out of Tatooine and make it to Alderine, Luke and Obi-Wan must confront a mercenary by the name of Han Solo (Harrison Ford) in which Luke has to sell his speeder to get the money; so now as all of them go to Han's Millennium Falcon, the storm troopers and other spies have a head out for Solo for which they leave the city of Tatooine and escape into outer space for which where they were heading doesn't exist anymore as Darth Vader's ship, the Death Star, is the only thing in space where the Falcon automatically goes in.It is where they catch up with Princess Leia and rescue her while they try to escape as Obi-Wan duels with Vader in which Obi-Wan dies as he disappears leaving Luke abandoned. It is now up to Luke, Han, and the Princess to join the rebel scouts in order to defeat the Death Star and save the planets from destruction.'Star Wars' is one of the greatest adventures ever made with a hero destined with dreams, a mercenary with a chip on his shoulder and great characters to which people will always make references about them and talk about the greatest moments of this film.",10,0,0,13 August 2003
Tarzan," one of the best Disney films ever made
","when I saw Tarzan in theaters, i was stunned to see that Tarzan could really kick ass compared to all of the black and white films they showed. This film had heart and story that made me cry and made me cheer throughout the entire time. When I left the theatre, i wanted to see the film one more time. But i still enjoy it when I watch it on Vhs.",10,2,2,10 October 2003
Fantastic Four," Four times the Fun!!!!!
","I bought the DVD for Fantastic Four and it was spectacular. Sure not many people considered to be a powerhouse film like Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, or the X-Men films, but it was fun nonetheless. Jessica Alba, Ioan Gruffurd, Michael Chiklis and Chris Evans play the four heroes after an accident in space along with their colleague, Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon) who becomes the movie screen villain. It's up to the four heroes to stop the bad guy from taking over the world, just like most superhero plots. I enjoyed Fantastic Four as now I have another superhero movie in my DVD collection to watch overs and overs again and still have a good time, featuring a great cast and awesome special effects.",10,3,6,9 December 2005
Jackie Brown," Not Tarantino's strongest movie, but has the energy not to forget who he is
","'Jackie Brown' was released in the holidays of 1997 where a lot of people were expecting to see another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, but were left short of luck by the bad press and the long timing compared to the ninety minute 'Reservoir Dogs' or the wild kinetic one-hundred fifty four minutes 'Pulp Fiction.' It was slumped due to the fact that the film came out on Oscar season where the majority of critics and fans were cheering for 'Titanic', 'As Good as it Gets', 'Good Will Hunting', 'The Full Monty', and 'L.A. Confidential.' Not to mention the comparisons of Pulp Fiction and seeing how there was no point besides the fact that Tarantino resurrected a few actors (Pam Grier, Robert Forester) and making references to pop culture along with having dead songs back to life.Pam Grier plays the title role in which she's an airline flight attendant for one of the most crappiest airport corporations in the world while still making a living. She gets caught up in a scandal after gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) kills a criminal who was connected with Jackie along with possession of drugs and fifty-thousand dollars in an envelope. Ordell bails her out and has plans with Jackie on her not to talk to any cops before she gets popped.Other characters include Max Cherry (Robert Forester) a bail bonds man who not only sees Ordell nearly everyday of his life, but has a small attraction with Jackie Brown. Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) just got out of jail after doing time for a bank robbery where he finds Ordell's mistress Melenie (Bridget Fonda) to be a pain in the ass. Michael Bowen and Michael Keaton play the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) cops who want to protect Jackie, but Keaton's character shows more coolness.Though this film isn't Quentin's strongest movie, it somehow manages to be entertainable to most fans. Some scenes make you laugh while other scenes will probably have you either guessing what will happen next to each character.",8,1,2,24 February 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," A Thrill Ride!
","The darker version of the trilogy as three years has passed since the original box-office smash; it was in February of 1997 where I watched the movie in its new edition and suddenly I was like the people who saw the film in 1980 where the sequel was better than ever. Though George Lucas became in charge of the production, he is not directing this film or the other sequel (Return of the Jedi) as Irvin Krishern (Robocop 2) takes over Lucas's desire in a way fans have never dreamed of.'Empire Strikes Back' starts off in the Ice Planet Hoth where Luke, Han and Leia have been stationed with the rebel troops as they try to hide from Darth Vader after the destruction of the Death Star. In the film's beginning, Luke and Solo have been separated during a snowstorm in which Luke gets attacked by a creature in the snow, and taking him where Luke will be lunch. Luke manages to defeat the creature, as he is now unstable to move where he sees the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi, telling him to go to see the master Jedi, Yoda where he will finish his Jedi training.After Han rescues Luke, the base camp is under attack by the Imperial as now everybody escapes from the camp, being separate from one another as Luke and R2-D2 take the X-Wing and go visit Yoda, while Han, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO take to Millennium Falcon to Cloud City to visit a pal of Han Solo's while escaping Darth Vader, who has hired bounty hunters to take Solo to Jabba the Hutt; and at the same time, Han has feelings for Princess Leia as he tries to put the moves on her.Luke and R2-D2 arrived in a deserted swamp in another planet where they meet the creature Yoda, who is small, old and is much like a doll that people will want to buy from the stores. Yoda gets Luke into shape, as he wants him to confront his enemies in the future; also to see if Luke has what it takes to be a Jedi knight without having any fears or anger towards his journey. The apprentice and the droid leave Yoda as Obi-Wan tells the green creature that he is their only hope; while Yoda says that there's another one with the same gift as Luke.Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO arrived at Cloud City where they meet Lando Calrissen (Billy Dee Williams), a mercenary turned peace adviser of the planet and friend to Han, where they go inside to relax, until 3PO has been abducted and Darth Vader arrives in the waiting room, capturing Luke's friends and taking them hostage. Vader has a surprise for Luke Skywalker where he has a carbonate freezer ready to kill Luke, but first, he must give bounty hunter Boba Fett what he wants: Han Solo. Vader tests the machine on Luke where he is a block of ice with a monitor on the side. Boba's got the prize and must return Solo to Jabba the Hutt.Luke arrives at the scene where Boba fires at him and than seeing the peril that his friends were in, R2-D2 goes to help the princess, chewy and 3PO as Luke finds Darth Vader in the carbonate room where they duel with a grand surprise in the end.'The Empire Strikes Back' is the best of the series, a more mature film where we get to know everything about the main characters and their flaws, not to mention how Irvin pulled it off since he directed this film; plus the John Williams score is a phenomenal as we hear the famous Imperial March. This is a grand ride that we will never hear the end of.",10,0,1,16 May 2005
Aladdin," Robin Williams made this worth watching
","I'm sorry, but I never took interest in why people would care for Aladdin or Jasmine when all along it was Robin Williams as the genie that gave the movie it's heart and soul. Most people and critics alike had applauded the film for being more of a Robin William's movie than caring for the other characters.The title character (Aladdin) is a street thief with his trusted monkey Abu (voice of Frank Welker) in which the thief must do what he can to survive until he meets a woman who's about to be punish before saving her. What he realizes is that the woman he saved (Jasmine) is a princess in which she must only marry a prince and not some peasant off the streets until Aladdin embarks on a journey with a prisoner of hidden treasures before finding a magic lamp with one insane genie (Robin Williams). Just like any other movie with a genie in a lamp, it's all about the three wishes in which one of them grants Aladdin the wish to be a prince to woo Jasmine.To me, it's all about Robin Williams and his impersonation of everybody to Groucho Marx, Arsenio Hall, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), and anybody you can think of that saves this movie.",6,0,5,14 May 2008
Sin City," Not for the weak or easily queasy.
","I'm a fan of comic books and superhero movies, but never had the pleasure of reading any of Frank Miller's graphic novels of Sin City or 300. With this film however, I can rank in with my other favorite comic book movies but for those who enjoy watching Batman Begins or Spider-Man 2, it's not for the very easy queasy.Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez direct this movie with Quentin Tarantino as a special guest director with an all star cast featuring Jessica Alba, Alexis Bledel, Bruce Willis, Michael Clarke Duncan, Michael Rourke, Clive Owen, Rosario Dawson and others where if you've seen the directors films from 'Desperado', 'Pulp Fiction', or 'From Dusk Till Dawn', you're in for a real nice surprise.'Sin City' uses three stories from the comic book series, each telling three different points of view connecting all the characters in one rotten city.The first story is about Marvin portrayed by Michael Rourke, a grunge man who is framed for murdering a stripper and not knowing about it. The funny thing is he's asleep when it happens. So Marvin goes all over town asking bad-ass hookers left and right where he meets one played by Carla Gugino. They go in search for the murderer where they realize that a cannibal (Elijah Wood) and a priest are involved.The second story tells the story of Dwight (Clive Owen) who finds out that the girl he is seeing (Brittany Murphy) is dating a corrupt cop named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who beats the hell out of Brittany Murphy's character and wants revenge. Dwight doesn't exactly kill Jackie Boy, but instead a group of hookers (the same ones Marvin met) led by Gail played by Rosario Dawson, kills Jackie Boy after his posse tries to harass one of the girls. Dwight and Gail are in shocked once they find out that the cop is connected with the rest of the good and bad officers along with the mafia in the city and if they find out that their own was killed, all hell will be broken loose.The third story shows Hardigan's (Bruce Willis) point of view as a washed up cop whose been out of the force after an incident involving a young Nancy Callahan (an older version is played by Jessica Alba) and the senator's son (Nick Stall) where Nancy was kidnapped before Hardigan saved the day by injuring the senator's son in places he can't grow; not until his partner played by Tarantino regular Michael Madsen injures him leaving him almost dead. The story involves Hardigan going in the line of duty to see Nancy one more time before realizing that her life is in danger.The film is shot in black and white where the only colors that show are detailed items from blood, pens, vehicles and anything that isn't human.Nonetheless, this is a one of the coolest comic book movies from Frank Miller to come up on screen while i stand by my decision when i say this is not a typical comic book movie.",10,1,2,21 January 2008
Gangs of New York," One of the best films I've ever seen
","Gangs of new york is the best American film i've ever seen. There are so many elements that made me love this movie: Daniel Day Lewis as the butcher(he rocks), the atmosphere in gangs: survival of the fittest, bigotry, illegal gambling, thieves and celebration. The film is about a young man(leonardo dicaprio in his best role) who seeks vengeance on Bill the butcher after the menace killed his father. I'm surprised that this film didn't come out in 2001 because this film would've had better chances for winning all the Oscars instead of a beautiful mind. I was enthralled, freaked out and surprised when i was this film. This has been another hit for Martin Scorsese since he wanted to direct this film for three decades. The acting is great, the cast fit the roles, the plot should've added more history, but it was wonderful and the atmosphere had my mouth dropping.",10,1,2,21 June 2003
Happy Feet," A really odd movie...that could've done better
","When I saw 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' on November 19, 2005, I remember seeing the trailer to 'Happy Feet,' one of the many trailers where people had been showing emotions. They gave that 'aww' emotion where even one girl almost broke out in tears before the crowd got wild at the feature presentation (Goblet of Fire).Somehow the trailer is better than the actual feature...'Happy Feet' tells the story about a penguin name Mumble who doesn't stand out like other penguins in their waddles while all he does is give out little tap dances where everybody sees him as very different. It's just like watching the Rudolph Christmas special where once the reindeer shines his red nose, he's considered a freak of nature. Mumble still does the things like penguins, he even chases fish until realizing that they aren't enough for the other penguins to eat. The first part of the story works like an average story about a penguin searching for answers until the second half falls to pieces where our hero discovers that maybe 'aliens' are taking the fish with no other way but to check it out and seeing that he's at a zoo where humans can't understand what he's saying.Elijah Wood provides the voice of Mumble where he's a charmer even though this film is not. The rest of the cast includes an all-star cast from Brittany Murphy as his love interest, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman as his parents; Robin Williams provides too many voices from Spanish ethnic penguins to a fat preachy penguin where sometimes it's either really hard to tell what he's on or why he's trying hard to bring the Genie from Aladdin out of his shell.This film won the Academy Award for best animated feature where either Cars or Monster House deserved the award.",6,1,3,20 March 2008
Goodfellas," The Gangster Film To Beat
","'As far back as I can remember I always wanted to be a gangster.'I remember reading Roger Ebert's review of 'Gangs of New York' and though his review of the film was biased, he mentions how GoodFellas was a classic in point of direction and of characters. As I recall, people have mention that 'The Godfather' is the best crime film ever made, but I disagree; 'The Godfather' was a film that showed the consequences of people in organize crime or in a organization, but not GoodFellas. GoodFellas shows the exciting sides of people in the mafia, where they would go to bars, dinners, and laugh at America and those who were inferior to them.GoodFellas is a story about a young Irishman name Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta as the older version) who every night sees the mobsters hanging on the other side of the street where he sees them park their cars in the middle of the streets, play cards and play their music all night without anybody complaining. The leader of the mafia is Paul Cicero (Paul Sorvino) who is reclusive towards the neighborhood, sure people have heard of him, but he doesn't like people watching him and yet Henry himself lies to his parents when he decides to work for Paul and his mafia and is finally notice in the neighborhood, though his father doesn't approve, his dad beats Henry a couple of times. But does that stop him? No.Years later, Henry grows up (Ray Liotta now) and is enjoying what he is actually doing. He steals and kills like the rest of the gangsters in order to make ends meat instead of working nine-to-five jobs for stupid paychecks.During the film we encounter a group of characters in the film that not only work for Henry, but also change the face in cinema history. Jimmy 'The Gent' Conway (Robert De Niro) is the rebel that cheers for the bad guys in the movie and has been in jail when he was twelve for stealing. In the film, Henry narrates that Jimmy 'enjoys' stealing and throughout the film, De Niro does make his presence where if you see his face, show him some respect. Another character in the film is Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) whose reputation is more than being in the mafia, but actually has a wild temper when somebody makes him mad. In one scene at a party, Tommy is embarrassed by the fact that the owner of the restaurant wants him to pay the tab of $7,000, and yet beats the hell out of the waiter proving that you can't mess with a crew of the mafia, no matter what the rank is.There's another character in the story that is also a narrator, and the character is Karen (Lorraine Bracco), who was pressure to go out with Henry on a double date so that way Tommy can bang the girl of his dreams. In one scene she is stood up by Henry and tells Tommy to go after her and after embarrassing Henry in front of the mafia on the streets, Karen goes out with Henry on a single date where she doesn't what he does. Later during the film, she finds out that he's in the mob and fears that she will lose him.A lot of things happen during the film; a made man is killed, Henry cheats on his wife and goes to jail, a money heist takes place, half of Jimmy's mafia gets whacked and a supporting character gets killed.With a great soundtrack and a great storyline, GoodFellas proves that cheering for the bad guys is a good thing after all.",10,0,0,20 July 2003
Shark Tale," I've seen better kids movies
","'Shark Tale' is the latest addition to the DreamWorks production in which instead of the great adventures from 'Shrek,' 'Sinbad and the Seven Seas,' 'The Road To El Dorado' and 'Antz' where they took place in land, we are now going underwater where things have turned upside down.'Shark Tale' is a story about a fish name Oscar (voiced by Will Smith) in which he has dreams of making it big in the little city that is similar to Times Square; but like everything else in his life, it backfires. His best friend is Angie (Renee Zellweger) a fish that has a crush on him and doesn't want to say anything as she writes love notes on paper. Oscar runs into big problems when his boss Sykes (Martin Scorsese) has made local shark boss Don Lino (Robert De Niro)mad where if the little fish doesn't come up with 5,000 dollars, Oscar will be shark bait.The subplot of the film involves Don Lino's youngest son Lenny (Jack Black) in which he doesn't want to take over the family business and the fact that he is a vegetarian where it upsets his father and his older brother Frankie, (Michael Imperiol) that the older brother forces Lenny to eat Oscar in which Frankie gets killed by an anchor leaving everybody to believe that Oscar killed a shark.'Shark Tale' is not as smart or acute as 'Finding Nemo' where we saw underwater in a new dimensional format or as funny as 'Shrek' where mixing cruelty and ethnicity was the key pattern; 'Shark Tale' is a parody of all of the Mafioso movies featuring De Niro and Scorsese from 'Godfather,' 'GoodFellas,' 'Scarface,' and other films where the characters are caught in a money situation; not to mention that kids will be curious on who the hell is Scorsese and De Niro. I say that because kids will be familiar with Will Smith (M.I.B. Films and ID4), Jack Black (School of Rock), Renee Zellweger (Jerry Maguire), Angelina Jolie (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider); but I would have felt better if they wouldn't make so many references to other films or pop culture items and just show a film where parents can take their kids to watch.Oh well, that's why we have Shrek 1 and 2 at home.",4,0,3,26 July 2005
Cinderella Man," Good movie with a bad timing and early release
","There's a curse that every year an inspiration movie from a true event needs to come and touch our hearts.Here's the next movie: Cinderella Man.Russell Crowe plays James Braddock, a champion boxer who does what he can to make ends meet on the side where every night he wins the fights to provide for his wife Mae (Renee Zellweger) and children. Years later when the depression hits, James and the family falls through the riches to rags era where James can't even find work while their bills are overdue, their power is shut off, and even to a point one of the kids goes far in stealing food fearing that he'll be taken away if his parents can't provide for him and his siblings.The Braddocks go through rough times until James former promoter Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) gives his old client another chance where the boxer is back on his feet after winning a fight. The money is back where James can put food on the table with Mae fearing for her life that if anything were to happen to her husband, what would happen to her? Who would provide for her kids? Just like most movies, there's the rival. (Note: This was one of the elements that was part of Cinderella Man's downfall) The rival is Max Baer (Craig Bierko), an undefeated championship who has killed his opponents in the ring where not only does James have to fight him but the publicity grows high leaving people to root for the underdog.'Cinderella Man' is a good effort from director Ron Howard while the performances from Crowe and Zellweger are strong and Paul Giamatti is the show stealer who deserved the nomination for best supporting actor showing that he's a dynamite actor.Despite the fact that the film is loaded with good actors and a famous director, the downfall for this good epic was the fact that this movie was released too early for Oscar contenders in the summer of 2005 just three months after Clint Eastwood's epic 'Million Dollar Baby' snag home the top award for best picture along with director and the acting awards (Actress, best supporting actor), including Crowe's brawl with a hotel manager along with other stuff.No matter, I still enjoyed this movie.",8,0,1,25 March 2008
Jurassic Park," Coolest movie ever!
","Monster pictures don't get any better than this, especially if it's a Steven Spielberg movie. Throughout the years, Spielberg has made some of the most impressive fairy tales involving creatures from 'E.T.', and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' where the main characters experience an 'ooh' and 'ahh' moment where their imagination drives them out of their minds with an accomplish goal.In 'Jurassic Park,' a billionaire named John Hammond (Richard Attenbrouogh) has decided to play with mother nature by bringing the most dangerous animals in the world: dinosaurs. He pays to keep an abandoned island called Isla Nublar where he decides to bring his own theme park of dinosaurs to life for which he wants to bring in paleontologists Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), lawyer Donald Gennero (Martin Ferrero) and theorist Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to evaluate what they think about the island.When we first see the island with the Brachiosaurus walking and eating from a tree, we are stunned to see a creature like never before come to the 20th century. Even when we see a herd of herbivores walking together towards a lake, we see the scene full of grace and wonder to see that it's not such a bad idea after all to have creatures on the face of this earththink again.In the film, the scientists and the theorist tell Hammond that it's a bad idea to bring creatures like dinosaurs into the 20th century where they have no idea where they are at and will destroy everything in their paths. Yet, Hammond wants to bring his dream to reality to attract the main audience: children. Hammond invites his grandkids Lex (Ariana Richards) and Tim (Joseph Mazzelo) to see what they think of the park; yet, Grant hates the idea of being a father. He even tells Ellie that kids are noisy, smelly and expensive.The people inside the Jurassic Park control room are Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck) who is the game warden who knows everything about the Raptors and fears that they do more harm than the main attraction, the T-Rex; Ray Arnold (Samuel L. Jackson) is one of the computer technicians along with Dennis Nedry (Wayne Knight of 'Seinfeld') who needs to get the embryos of every dinosaur species in order to get three million dollars and decides to shut down the security system in order to get the embryos.As much as I gave away some of the plot of the film, what I liked about the film was the special effects and how ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) brought the dinosaurs to life. Jurassic Park may not have the best story line, but there is one thing that gets this film going: the nightmares of extinct dinosaurs coming to life.",9,1,2,19 December 2003
The Simpsons Movie," The Simpsons Movie Review
","Ever since their own television show in 1989 after a little program called 'The Tracey Ullman Show' introduced our favorite family in one minute skits, they finally have a movie of their own where it's pure delight from minute one of Homer and the family watching Itchy and Scratchy before the paterfamilias tells the citizens of Springfield that they are better off waiting for the movie on cable than pay to see it at a movie theater. That's Homer right there, folks! 'The Simpsons Movie' has every character you love from the sinister Mr. Burns and his 'sissy' assistant Waylon Smithers, to the drunken Barney Gumble, the goody-goody Flanders, the funny Jewish clown Krusty the Klown and more where the premise of the first length feature of the popular show involves a chemical in the lake where after the mayor of Springfield hears Lisa out on helping the environment, they block the lake with barricades and a fake wall to keep the water clean. Does everybody listen? By now you would've figured that Homer wouldn't while enjoying his lovable pet pig he saved from being slaughtered as he ruins the lake with crap the pig made not before being contained by a crazed EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) member by the name of Russ Cargill (the funny Albert Brooks) where it's up to Homer and the Simpsons to save the day along with the citizens of Springfield.This isn't the first feature length film from animation to be released to the big screen where back in 1999 we had South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut where just like the Comedy Central hit, it stayed true to its roots in being dirty and vulgar to make people laugh just like the show. The Simpsons Movie stays true to its reputation for being funny along with the fact that there's no stopping Homer or Bart's shenanigans.The film is under 90 minutes where it's just fun.",8,1,2,28 March 2008
Evil Dead II," A true grindhouse movie!
","About the time Spider-Man 2 was about to hit theaters in the summer of 2004, not only did I started watching the first film on DVD but also wanted to experiment Sam Raimi's other features. I was at a dollar store where I saw the widescreen version of Evil Dead II sitting around in a case where I bought the film and became both entertained and interested in more of Raimi's work.Evil Dead II is the sequel to the infamous Evil Dead where Ash (Bruce Campbell) drives off to the woods with his girlfriend to get a little action until an evil spirit manages to possess Ash's sweetheart turning her into a monster. He kills her before realizing that the cabin is haunted where in some scenes he'll be possessed into a demon monster forcing him to chop his own hand off. Other characters from a babe scientist and her husband and a pair of locals go to the house to discover that something evil is in the house and discover what's going on before it's too late and they're all dead.The film is both scary and funny, but the special effects make it truly realistic where an NC-17 rating was almost added unless the blood wasn't red on all scenes. Even for an early Sam Raimi movie, I love how Bruce Campbell manages to blend in humor and seriousness at the same time where I couldn't help myself but laugh, especially the way Raimi likes to torture his actors.",8,1,2,14 April 2008
V for Vendetta," I'm a person, damnit, and i have the right to choose on how i want to live!
","'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.' 'V for Vendetta' is about the right to live in which you would have to imagine if totalitarianism were to happen today where you would no longer have the rights to say what you want, choose the people you would consider heroes or villains, or even walk out at night just for a peaceful stroll.In London, England, everything is ruled by Adam Sutler (John Hurt) an Adolf Hitler look-alike who has control of all things where if something is offensive or speaks of the truth, it must be removed immediately giving the people no information about what is going on in their world. In other words, he wants them to be mindless sheep and not have brains for themselves or the freedom to express anything.Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) works at the BBC news as an assistant to pederast and news reporter Deitrich (Stephen Fry) along to members of the news where in one foggy night (November 5) she decides to go on a stroll where she's stop by Sutler's police after breaking curfew. They attack her until a vigilante who goes by the name of V (Hugo Weaving) saves Evey and takes her in protection. From there Evey and V form a bond where she sees that not only is he a man of vengeance, but an educated person who has books like a library and everything for a museum display.As we see more in the film, V's personal business is to go after everybody from doctors, news reporters, priests, and anybody who had to do with his imprisonment leaving him to be the marked man he has become.Overall, this is one great flick where I didn't keep my eyes off for one second just as it's not only an action movie produced by the same guys who made 'The Matrix,' but features on impressive cast and a moral lesson to be considered.",10,2,7,24 February 2008
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," the best film of 2001
","O Brother, Where Art Thou? has it all: great vocabulary, music, parodies and laughter. George Clooney, John Turturro, John Goodman, Tim Blake Nelson and Holly Hunter star in this comedy crime caper about three prisoners going to seek treasure and on the way, meet strange people, get into perils, make people feel better and has a happy ending. I love the Coen brother's and this is one of their best work ever made****(Excellent)",10,0,1,21 February 2004
