The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Huge Disappointment, It had such potential
","People may say I'm harsh, but it isn't without good reason. This is what happens when you take a long book and try to split it into two movies- which, I get it, they really just wanted more money. If you make it into one, people will argue that it's a bit too long, and you may end up losing some great scenes when they make cuts on the director's floor. But this movie dragged on and on, so many references to the previous movie that we didn't need, and I was getting tired of Jennifer Lawrence: 1) Staring deadpan into the camera in a 'deep' connection, 2) Crying at the drop of a hat and constantly having an emotional breakdown, 3) Only talking about Peta and basically not giving a damn about anybody else, 4) The lack of any kind of REAL action for at least 3/4 of the movie. I get it, and yes, I have read the books. Katniss goes through a lot, and I understand that mentally/emotionally that takes a toll on any person. But Lawrence falls incredibly short with this one (though it's really not all her fault by any means). Where I used to be rooting for the characters, now I was getting more annoyed with their movements, bored and uncaring with their problems, wondering where the STRONG connections in the first books went between SO MANY characters, and wondering why when their were breaks between characters none of it was really played out or portrayed in a way that would make sense to the audience member. I saw it at a movie tavern, and I watched people walk out THIRTY MINUTES before the movie was done. I was incredibly tempted myself but I figured I paid so I should wait. I didn't even stay to see if there was an easter egg- I ALWAYS STAY TO SEE IF THERE'S AN EASTER EGG- because I was so over it and just didn't care. Don't waste your money in theaters, a dollar rental or a download to your T.V./computer will do just fine- there was no real action to see in this anyway, save for the last 2 minutes of the movie, and even THAT I'm sure you can find on youtube. So sad, I'll probably just download the last one online when it comes out, not getting duped and wasting my money like that again.",3,20,31,24 November 2014
