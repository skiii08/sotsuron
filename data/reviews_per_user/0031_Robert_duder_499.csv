The King's Speech," Finally understand the hype...three years later
","I always try to see as many of the Oscar nominated pictures as I can. This year (2012) I did very well. Previous years, not so much as I have still not even see The Artist. Finally, I sat down and watched The King's Speech and was very pleasantly surprised. Sometimes its better to watch a film like this after the hype has died down. It was so very well acted, powerfully written and just a very fascinating time in history. It would seem that the film might drag a little considering the entire film is literally all about King George's Speech impediment and his rise to the monarchy but the pacing for the film is very near perfect. Never once did I fee like it was dragging or spending an excessive amount of time on something it shouldn't be. The characters were all excellent and the actors portraying them nothing short of brilliant. The film blends together appropriate drama with a certain amount of comedy, however dark it may be. The distinctive relationship between a commoner (who doesn't allow himself to be treated as such) and the Prince, eventually King of England was perhaps one of the best aspects of the film. Both roles were played so masterfully.Colin Firth is just simply brilliant as King George. He has this incredible pressure on him to perform his Kingly duties and yet he is soft spoken, suffering a great deal from his impediment and seems so withdrawn socially. Firth brings this character to life and gives you such a deep feeling of empathy for him. Geoffrey Rush is equally amazing as vibrant, strong willed speech therapist Lionel Logue. The chemistry between Firth and Rush has to be seen to truly understand. It carries this film to new heights. Their strange friendship of convenience is so interesting to watch unfold. Rush's Logue is a fascinating character and the film allows time to explore him as much as Firth's King George. Helena Bonham Carter is good as Firth's wife, Queen Elizabeth. I wouldn't say she is great and her performance is easily buried by the powerhouse performances of her co-stars. Her character is mostly background but she serves her purpose.Tom Hooper has now given two absolutely breathtaking films in the last two years. Les Miserables was nothing short of stunning and one of the best films of last year. It far deserved the Oscar from Argo in my opinion. Hooper seems methodical and he's not afraid to spend the time necessary to explore his characters and really get the most out of his cast. The King's Speech might not be the sort of drama that mainstream movie goers would gravitate to but I am convinced that this movie would surprise people how good it is. One of the things I really liked about it was that it wasn't cut and dry. This wasn't the Rocky of speech therapy movies where he trains and trains and suddenly throws off his impediment and becomes an amazing speaker. He does train in various little speech lessons and tricks of the trade but he struggles right up until his last speech. He overcomes a lot but he doesn't become this brilliant speaker overnight. One of my favourite scenes was when Winston Churchill (played by Timothy Spall) tells King George that he too suffered from a speech impediment and how he overcame it. The film is a near perfect drama that entertains, inspires and tells a true story that everyone can enjoy. I insist you give this one a chance! 9/10",9,1,2,16 March 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Easily met my expectations! Even smarter than the first. Wan and Whanell are Horror Genius'
","The first Insidious was easily one of the creepiest, best horror films I have ever seen. It was a solid 10 and gave me the chills and thrills like few horror movies ever do. I was thrilled to hear about this sequel but also a little cautious because how could they possibly follow up something so great and make it anywhere near as good. Well I can assure you that Insidious Chapter 2 knocks it out of the park. It isn't perfect and it falls short just a slight bit from the original amazing film but in other ways it is superior to the first film. Insidious Chapter 2 takes the story to a whole new level. Whereas the first movie provided a fairly typical possession story, with ghosts and demons and a family being terrorized this film took all of that and added an entire new level, depth, intellect and incredible story that launched Insidious into horror film hall of fame if it already wasn't there. I predict with another film or two (please keep making them!) that Parker Crane will be synonymous with Freddy Kreuger, Jason Voorhees or Jigsaw more recently. I won't go into details about Parker Crane but this film flawlessly combines The Exorcist, Psycho, Friday The 13th and Amityville Horror and the potential behind this franchise could bury all of those.I do love Patrick Wilson and in the first film I thought he was fantastic at being the doting father and a down to earth man you could relate to and root for. Insidious Chapter 2 gives him an entirely new character arc to sink his teeth into and he nails it. This is equivalent as far as I'm concerned to Ryan Reynolds brilliant turn in the Amityville Horror remake. This was a new level for Wilson and it was terrific. Rose Byrne also returns as his wife. Byrne is good and their chemistry is very good. My issue with her is that she does a lot of crying in this film and very little else. I didn't feel like she was as strong as some of the other cast members and some of the plot holes I noticed this time around had to do with her character. Still Byrne is decent and I'm glad she came back again. Barbara Hershey gets a much more significant part in the sequel. She is very good as Wilson's mother and this time she plays investigator as she goes hunting for the mystery behind the thing haunting her family. Steve Coulter joins the cast as the lead psychic taking over from Lin Shaye (who does return as well in a smaller role.) Coulter is decent but I think it might have been really cool and very effective to have someone significant play the role...a major cameo. Still Coulter is good and plays the part very well. As mentioned Lin Shaye returns in her role and she is as good as she was in the first film, although a smaller part and a very different aspect to her character. The most impressive thing about Shaye's character was the girl that played the younger version of her (Lindsay Seim) who bore a striking resemblance to her and I assume they used Shaye's voice as hers because it was remarkable and a very cool aspect of the film to give it a very authentic feel. Leigh Whannell and Angus Sampson also return as Specs and Tucker. They were certainly the comic relief in the first film but done so in an appropriate manner and it was the same in this film. They had a few awkwardly funny moments (in a good way) but less than the first. This time they got a little more depth to their characters and more scenes but the comedy angle was done properly too only serving to just barely break the tension for a fleeting moment.James Wan returns to direct this instalment and I can pretty honestly say together with his partner Leigh Whannell, these guys dominate the horror genre. They single handedly rule it. The Saw franchise (started by them) gave new life to the horror genre and spawned COUNTLESS copy cats. The Conjuring, Insidious and now its sequel were just terrific paranormal thrillers. They craft very complex stories but impressively so. They built exponentially on the first Insidious and in one film created an incredible amount of lore and back story to build on in future films. While Insidious: Chapter 2 didn't quite give me the creeps like the first film did, it was ten times smarter and therefore incredibly entertaining. That isn't to say there aren't some very creepy moments. There are a few things in the background of scenes that you catch briefly that will send you into chills. No matter how you look at it, this is a very worthy sequel and an absolute must see following the first incredible film. 9/10",9,2,4,17 September 2013
The Benchwarmers," Silly, stupid, but you know what?? Fun.
","The Benchwarmers was no more or less of anything I expected from it. If you go in with high expectations I think there is something wrong with you?? It only delivers exactly what it presents...silly, slapstick, dumb, gross out comedy with a bit of a feel good message. I have to say that it almost exceeded what little expectations I had for it because it was more fun than I thought it would be. Wanna know how dumb The Benchwarmers is?? Rob Schneider plays the cool, jock guy of the bunch!! ANNND he's married to Molly Sims!! Uh huh. Need I say more?? On that note Rob Schneider sort of headlines the cast as Gus, the less nerdy, more cool and together guy of the bunch. The bunch being his less cool best friends. Schneider is actually pretty good in his role. He's good enough to be the team leader and actually pulls off looking like he knows what he's doing on the ball field. He kind of plays a more suave version of Deuce Bigalow because he still makes the under-appreciated feel better about themselves. David Spade tones down his usual over the top performance to play Richie Goodman. Spade still delivers an ample amount of his one liners and insults which is good because he wouldn't be Spade without them. Overall...it's the same role he plays every time. Speaking of which...Napoleon Dynamite makes his 3rd Big screen appearance since the film from which he spawned. Jon Heder returns in Benchwarmers playing the same role he played in Napoleon Dynamite, and making sure to get a Napoleon line in there too. ('Yah cause it's so big'--his brain) I mean Heder is funny and has some really great physical comedy it's just not different that's all. Spade and Schneider are much more toned down for The Benchwarmers but Heder is at full swing. Another toned down comedian who I was pretty impressed with was Jon Lovitz as the billionaire former nerd funding The Benchwarmers. Lovitz usually drives me insane with his incessant yammering and annoying over the top supposed comedy but this time he was good. He has some suaveness to his character, had some good lines and didn't take it too far. Craig Kilborn was good as the preppy former bully who is coaching his son and their teammates against the nerds and losers. Kilborn efficiently makes you dislike him by being rich and snotty and tough on his kid. You'd think the kids would be more of a focus on the film but it's more about the three guys getting retribution for their years of torture from the bullies and inspiring some kids while they do it.Adam Sandler buddy director Dennis Dugan takes the helm and does what he does. The jokes are one liners and grossly made bodily functions and nose picking and the likes...and of course the must have baseball gags of not being able to hit, catch, throw, run do anything. See what I am saying is that this film is just A-Typical period. It's exactly what it says it will be, it's exactly what you could expect and it's 150% predictable beginning to end and nobody does anything they haven't done 100 times before. So is it a 1/10?? NOOOOO. It's still funny and kinda cute and even slightly heartwarming amidst the fart jokes and such. Kids will probably go head over heels for it and adults will just roll their eyes but sneak a smile. It's not so bad, in fact it's probably even worth seeing. Better than your average dumb film. 8/10",8,0,3,8 May 2006
Moneyball," Its like sitting in a 2.5 hour business meeting...let the argument begin
","Every year there has to be one BIG award winning film that I just shake my head about and wonder what the hell everyone is thinking? Slumdog Millionaire was WAY over hyped, American Beauty, Babel, every George Clooney movie...I could go on. But Moneyball is the exact definition of me shaking my head. I thought Moneyball was downright boring. Yes the performances were solid but the content of the movie, and the scenes were simply boring. The film was about two hours too long and nothing of any significance ever happens. I am just constantly surprised by people's comments on this film and I don't just mean professional critics. IMDb reviewers are saying...Best Film of 2011, 'Incredible', Brad Pitt's best role...surely some sort of mass hypnosis has been done because this movie was not even average. It was boring, contrived, with zero climax and had more to do with money than baseball.Brad Pitt gives a decent performance as Billy Beane. It is an okay role. He does a good job. Without him this film probably would have been a 2/10 or less. But this wouldn't even fit in his top twenty performances and I think he's an outstanding actor. Sorry Mr. Pitt but you shouldn't get a nomination let alone the award for this. Jonah Hill is also decent as Peter Brand. He is the straight man but also the comic relief delivering some funny lines and him and Pitt have a good but awkward chemistry opposite each other. His performance is as good as Pitt's which isn't saying that either of them are outstanding. The very talented Philip Seymour Hoffman is completely underplayed and underused in this film. His whole character amounts to scowling and making angry faces at Pitt. Robin Wright getting top billing in this film is ludicrous as she is pointless and useless and hardly shows up. She has long been reduced to a sub character actor.This whole review and my entire opinion can be reduced to the film being over-rated quite simply. What about this movie makes it so fantastic? Why is this better than the thousands of other movies released this year? I know that I'm in a minority of people that didn't like it but I think sometimes people get caught up in hype. I saw Moneyball within its first week, if not weekend, so before all the hype started and I was bored to tears. The entire plot is Pitt sitting in an office calling people, bantering back and forth, and nothing ever happens. To call this a baseball film is ridiculous because it has nothing to do with playing baseball. Anyways millions will flock to see it, it will likely be on the top of everyone's awards list but for me, outside of a few decent performances, was a dud all around. 5/10",5,12,20,13 January 2012
Whip It," Terrific and entertaining!! A real gem! Way to go Drew!
","The first time I saw a trailer for Whip It I thought it looked decent enough and it could be a fun film. There is nothing better than when a film exceeds all your expectations and really impresses you and that is exactly what this film did. Whip It is in the simplest form is just downright fun. Solid performances (even some by people I don't care for), great characters, and just a fun feel good movie that doesn't hold back. If anything can be said for Drew Barrymore's directorial debut she knows how to put together a good story. I might even go so far as to say that the film is extremely under rated and doesn't seem to appeal to people as much as I would have thought. I can promise you this that if you just sit back and relax and truly enjoy having fun you'll come out of the movie with a smile on your face. My single disappointment with the film was that I expected some really intense emotion towards the end and it never really delivers on that front. I was fully prepared to actually swallow my masculinity and tear up but it was never necessary. So while it might fall short from some great emotion it is still a really amazing fun movie.Desperately trying to move beyond the just Juno phase Ellen Page plays quirky and quiet Bliss Cavender. She does a terrific job and she definitely has amazing screen presence which she proved when she blazed on the screen in Juno (average movie, amazing role). She is simply watchable and you root for her and she plays the roller derby role like a pro. Two truly outstanding supporting roles to watch for are by the versatile amazing Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern. Harden is terrific as the straight laced reserved mother and Stern is simply amazing (best role I've ever seen him in outside of Marv in Home Alone) as Bliss' loving if not slightly distant father. Both of them have small roles but are truly excellent in their roles. Kristen Wiig is one of my least favorite Saturday Night Live cast members and I just usually can't stomach her performances and yet here she is giving an incredibly serious and really solid performance as single mother and roller champ 'Maggie Mayhem.' Similarly Jimmy Fallon gives a decent, very tolerable performance as roller derby host Johnny Rocket. The rest of the girls are a solid and fun cast including director herself Drew Barrymore, Zoe Bell, Eve and another of my least favorite actresses Juliette Lewis who is also very good in her role. Also deserving honorable mention is a small supporting role by actress Alia Shawkat as Juno's...errr I mean Ellen Paige's best friend Pash. She is awesome and I hope to see her do some really great roles in the future.Drew Barrymore put together a terrific ensemble to rally around a terrific character brought to my life by Ellen Paige. If anything could be said about Barrymore is that she brings the very best out of her cast. She managed to take several rather loud and potentially obnoxious comedians (Fallon, Wiig, Lewis) and gives them a much more serious and toned down persona that shows off their very best. Whip It is an adventure for a lot of people behind the scenes. Barrymore in her directorial debut and the writer of the novel as well as the screenplay Shauna Cross appears to be new to screen writing, and I think the performances in the film are a new style to a lot of the actors too. No matter how you shake it Whip It is just a blast. It's fun and touching and anybody can sit down and enjoy it. See this movie and do yourself a favor. And shockingly enough they do not play the overplayed movie song 'Whip It.' Weird eh? 8.5/10",8,5,12,1 February 2010
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," National Treasure still holds itself together despite some minor flaws
","How good is National Treasure: Book of Secrets? Well I'm hailing it with exact same score I gave the original one three years ago and I have A LOT of good things to say about it. The biggest problem with the film is the complexity of the puzzles and story leave some major plot holes including the biggest one of all that holds the entire story together...how does finding a lost city of gold vindicate Ben Gates' ancestor? It just doesn't make sense. But even that is easily overlooked for a romping adventure with a terrific cast, some additions to the cast, and the second half is truly an adventure to behold. The best part is that National Treasure: Book of Secrets holds to the original formula by creating a whole new genre of action, treasure hunting by keeping things in North America with witty and smart puzzles and a treasure and history...all based on real events and places. This installments takes you from France, to the Queen's office in Buckingham to the Oval Office to Mount Rushmore without even taking a breath. With the original film (see my review) I really harped on the name of the film but I must have grown accustomed to it because I don't think National Treasure is such a bad name for the series...it's even fitting.I have said so many times before that I do not care for Nicholas Cage but how do I keep saying that and then love most of his films (Ghost Rider aside--see my review.) Plus I love Ben Gates. Cage plays the swashbuckling hero treasure hunter flawlessly and I think captures even more personality in this second installment. He is even more likable, more wild and unhinged, and more fun than even the first one. Cage has a very bankable character with Gates. Justin Bartha returns as hilarious sidekick Riley Poole, and they definitely use him more in this one for comic relief which can be a risk throwing that much comedy into the role but he does alright. I think they should give him more of an action based role next time around, put him in the thick of things but he has some more neat gadgets and pulls the role off well and him and Cage have good hero/sidekick chemistry. Diane Kruger also returns as Cage's love interest (now broken up) Abigail Chase. She is lovely and sexy and the perfect addition to the cast again. She's smart and strong and looks confident as the female lead and a great match for Cage who has been paired up with some odd females in the past. The terrific Jon Voight also returns as Cage's father Patrick Gates. He plays a bigger role this time around which is terrific because he was so good in the original. His character is soft spoken, a little clumsy and shy and he does a terrific job bringing that character back. Newcomers to the cast are welcome!! Helen Mirren (who I admit I have not always been a fan of and I think she's over rated) does a really terrific job as Cage's mother and Voight's long time divorced wife. Voight and Mirren have great chemistry together and make great treasure hunters and their volatile and feisty relationship mirrors that of Cage and Kruger's relationship. Now a stumbling block...in the original film Sean Bean was a terrific villain, no holds barred, clearly evil and a terrific nemesis. A great predecessor would be Ed Harris, who is amazing all the time. He plays fame hunter Mitch Wilkinson who wants nothing more than Gates to lead him to a treasure so he can be famous. The problem is Harris plays both sides...sometimes he's evil and other times he's not such a bad guy and even comes across as a hero in the end. So the film is lacking something a clear good vs evil line. There is no real main villain. Harris's character is kind of wishy washy and not really strong in either aspect and that's a shame and a waste of his great talent. Harvey Keitel also returns in a very small cameo as the FBI agent who hunted Gates down originally and he's doing the same in a smaller capacity. Bruce Greenwood also makes for a terrific President of The United States which he has done before in other films.The concept of treasure hunting in our own back yard is terrific and exciting and there is no shortage of underground caverns and terrific puzzles and right off the bat you're treated to a re-creation of the Lincoln assassination which is really something to get your blood pumping for the rest of the film. No matter what...either National Treasure film and more so with this one now there must be a suspension of belief. You have to let go of the fact that there is NO way a single person could sneak in and out of Buckingham Palace, The Oval Office, The Library of Congress and kidnapping the President...yes all the happens. But somehow the cast makes you believe it possible and this wonderful fantasy, slapstick, adventure comes alive. Don't hold back...this one is great for kids and adults and watch the first one and then go see the second, just don't take it too seriously and you'll have a great time!! 9/10",9,0,5,25 December 2007
Million Dollar Arm," Disney does what they do best and provides a solid genre flick
","There are NO surprises with Million Dollar Arm. The trailer looked good and I could have sat down and written this myself because of the trailer, because its Disney and because we've seen it all before. Its not always baseball but we've seen this again and again. But so what? There are a lot of genre movies that use the same formula and still manage to be entertaining and Million Dollar Arm is exactly that. A fun, sweet, memorable little flick that will make you smile but adds absolutely nothing new to the family friendly sports genre. It doesn't strike the heart strings deeply but you will definitely appreciate it. It gives you exactly what you should go in expecting. I do wish they had tried just a little harder to find something new to cover but it is what it is and I enjoyed it. It certainly is a fun story, based on real events and I loved seeing the real characters at the end. Usually the best part of a 'based on a true story' film is getting the what happened after update. I admit I did almost tear up at one particular part involving a performance that ends up being truly terrific but there have been other Disney or Disney like sports stories that had me crying like a blubbering baby.Jon Hamm will be looking to Hollywood films with the end of Mad Men imminent and I welcome him! He does a good job playing Sport's agent JB (Mr. JB sir...you'll get the joke after you see the movie.) The only issue with him in this film is how excruciatingly obvious and stereotypical his character is. We have seen this type of character beaten to death. He's rich, a womanizer, big ego, fast car and he's going to be humbled and learn about life and love and find the woman of his dreams. Call it the Emilio complex (Mighty Ducks anyone?) Hamm still handles it well though and he is very charismatic on screen. Pitobash is straight up amazing as the wanna-be Baseball coach that Hamm reluctantly takes under his wing. Pitobash only gets better throughout the film and he is adorable and fun and you will absolutely love him in this. Not to be outdone the other two stars to come out of this film are Suraj Sharma and Madhur Mittal as the two Million Dollar Arm contestants from India. They are terrific and they play the fish out of water card perfectly without overdoing it and they don't come across as stupid but rather just struggling to live in a completely different world. The four of them (including Hamm) have terrific, outstanding chemistry that really drive this film. Lake Bell feels like an awkward choice for the film. I don't mean to say she isn't good because she does a decent job but she seems to be the oddest fit in the film. Her and Hamm have good chemistry but are such an odd couple (which is also supposed to be the point.) She plays her role with an edge of eccentricity and it stood out in the movie. Still, she was good and I didn't mind her in the role. Alan Arkin...oh its becoming almost painful to watch him. I love the guy, he's a legend, but this is honestly the only role he ever plays anymore. He's a crotchety, old, washed up has been who yells at people and he does it again and again and again. He nailed it in Little Miss Sunshine and has been literally beating the role to death ever since (Grudge Match, Argo, Burt Wonderstone.) I guess if they needed someone for that role they might as well have Arkin. Bill Paxton was also good in a small role that was very effective.So we have a good to great cast, a painfully predictable script and some characters but a feel good film nonetheless. Disney knows what it does best and this is one of those times. Craig Gillespie is sort of an up and coming director and I'm already a fan. He directed the absolutely brilliant Fright Night remake and has had his hand in some decent comedies as well along the way. I'm not sure this would have been hard to direct given they probably handed him the recipe and told him to bake the cake exactly as it said. Still, the scenes in India were very nice and it definitely hit the right nerves to be in that setting to get the contrast of where these boys come from. The romance is well paced (I hate when they rush the lead couple together) and the film won't offend or annoy anyone. It's just fun. I did feel it dragged just a little bit in the middle but I won't fault them for making sure the entire story was told. All in all if you love baseball, sports films or are looking for something reasonably acceptable for the family (there are some mild sexual innuendos and one or two minor four letter words) then try this one out. Enjoy it but keep your expectations middle of the road. 7.5/10",7,0,0,22 May 2014
Angels & Demons," Much like the book easily surpasses The DaVinci Code in style, story, and character!
","The DaVinci code film was a decent movie. I had very high expectations for it and I must admit that they didn't really fulfill them although in watching the film again prior to this one I think I enjoyed it more the most recent time through. Still there was something almost campy about it and it certainly wasn't meant to be campy but rather an intellectual spin, a dramatic take on religion and Christianity. I read Angels and Demons and enjoyed the book much more than The DaVinci Code book so I was really looking forward to the newest film. Despite those expectations I was not disappointed for a moment with the film. Was it different than the book? Absolutely. Did they take liberties? They have to. Regardless the pace, the story, the characters, the suspense all easily surpassed The DaVinci Code film. Perhaps Angels and Demons was less complicated but I think for everything director Ron Howard did right in the first one there were plenty of complaints and advice and I think he kept what was right about the first film and fixed most or some of the wrongs making this one even better and really giving the character of Robert Langdon legs to go a long ways on the big screen.Of course truly giving Langdon legs is the amazing and unstoppable Tom Hanks who is literally one of the greatest actors in the history of theatrics (in my opinion.) Now Robert Langdon is a bit of a laid back character, doesn't have a lot of zest necessarily, same in the books but Hanks makes him likable and he definitely gives him more personality in Angels and Demons that was lacking from DaVinci Code. Hanks is just fun in the role and best of all his chemistry lights up the screen and makes the whole adventure a blast. Ewan McGregor, who I have not always been a fan of, is downright brilliant (award worthy dare I say) as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna. Hanks and McGregor have terrific chemistry opposite each other and McGregor's character is fantastic. Stellan Skarsgård gives a terrific performance, but rather understated as Commander Richter, an anti-hero that really helps the story along. Langdon's female companion this time is Ayelet Zurer who does a great job in the role but she seemed so similar in look and personality to the girl in the original film that it was like watching her all over again so she kind of gets swept under the rug in my opinion. Legendary character actor Armin Mueller-Stahl has an appropriate but subtle performance as a main Cardinal hoping to become Pope.In some ways it was only natural that Angels and Demons be a more entertaining film. The action and suspense is higher, the religious overtone while absolutely present isn't the driving force behind the plot, and Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard had time to learn and hone the characters and story and everything else. Sequels are rarely known for surpassing their originals but this one does in every sense of the word. Both films are worth seeing and both are cutting a place in film history for box office success and it is certain that they will do the third Robert Langdon film and I will definitely want to be there to see because so far they have only improved and Angels and Demons turned out to be one of, if the not thee, best sequel of the summer! 9/10",9,2,6,23 August 2009
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," I eat my words!!
","Yes I said I never liked Quentin Tarantino. Yes I boycotted seeing this film and it's previous installment because I was furious that Tarantino continually gets more popular despite his constant attempts at being so called different and outrageous. He tries too hard and I still stand by that but when it comes to the amazing and brilliant Kill Bill Series, I gladly and whole heartedly eat my words.The two Kill Bill volumes are as different as they are important to each other. They are both very much from the same series and the story continues over completely but nonetheless they are very very different and in that Tarantino finally finds some actual uniqueness. He managed to create two completely different films that are directly sequels of each other and keep getting better. The first Kill Bill was action packed, gore, constant non stop revenge whereas the second installment is softer in a grotesque kind of way. The initial fiery revenge has calmed some but 'The Bride's' self imposed mission has not changed. Instead in Volume 2 all the characters and actors get the opportunity to really show some acting ability with more emotion than the original. Uma Thurman is still brilliant (and I was never a fan before) as The Bride. She will be one of the most memorable film characters in history. Her anger, and emotions, and in this volume we get to see where all this hatred and vengeance stems from. At the same time we get to see her brought to her knees by the one last thing she feels real human emotion for...her daughter. The battles and enemies in Volume Two are no less amazing then they were in volume one. Michael Madsen's character is a little underused but credit must be given to him as the only one who actually nearly stops The Bride's rampage. Daryl Hannah, who gave us a glimpse of her deadly character Elle Driver becomes a full fledged enemy in Volume 2. She is deadly and deceitful and wicked and their fight in the tiny, cramped trailer is awesome. Perhaps one of the best things about Volume 2 is the intense history we are treated to. Whereas Volume One opened a can of questions Volume 2 answers them all right from the beginning. We hear Bill, we know a little about him but we never see him in the original. Why was The Bride at that chapel, how did she get there, who is she, what is her history? Right from the beginning we see Bill, we get to know the history between them and what was going on during the execution.One of the best things in the film is seeing where and when The Bride became such a gruesome, awesome killing machine at the hands of legendary Oriental Judo master Pai Mei. The shining star of Kill Bill Volume 2 is none other than Bill himself. David Carradine creates one of the most scary, brutal, maniacal, calculating killers and evil bad guys in film history. His voice and mannerisms can't help but give you shivers. This is without a doubt his most brilliant role. I was mildly disappointed at the brief encounter and battle between him and The Bride and how easily he is defeated although in a way it's poetic justice and makes sense...or...maybe that wasn't his defeat?? I think with what Tarantino has done with Volume's one and two it's safe to say he could do a smart and worthy volume three. I have a whole new respect for his direction and this series. It's captivating and original and stylish and classic film already. 9/10",9,0,1,1 September 2005
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," A whole lot of politics to bring the series to a close
","So far I'm not a huge fan of the latest concept of splitting final instalments into two parts just to gain more money. I am certain they would have you believe that they need to tell more story but if you look at Harry Potter and now The Hunger Games, you'll plainly see there really isn't any reason to split the last two films. Now, I'm not saying Mockingjay: Part 1 isn't good...in fact it has a lot going for it and its such a great story and series that it would be awfully hard to really screw it up. Even still, there is a lot of dialogue and a ton of politics and this one is very light on the action. This film also is very bleak and jaded. One thing The Hunger Games series (both book and film) has always stood for is the hidden and not so hidden political and social commentary that is so relevant even now. Mockingjay has even more of that but its not the same message. You get to watch the manipulation of Katniss and others by the Capitol and the leaders of the rebellion and there is even a brief but very interesting scene where Plutarch is mouthing the words to the President's speech demonstrating even she is being manipulated. Who are the good guys? Mockingjay blurs the story just a little bit. Mockingjay wins you over with some really powerful imagery, terrific characters and the promise of what the final film will bring.Jennifer Lawrence is probably one of Hollywood's biggest and youngest superstars and for good reason. As Katniss Everdeen she captured the down to earth heroine and makes you root for her at every turn. She is definitely in a dark place in this film and its hard to watch her being manipulated. Outside of the arena, Katniss is less in charge of herself but the film has a different tone. Lawrence is still great in the role. Josh Hutcherson also returns in a slightly smaller role as Peeta Mellark. However, this might be the strongest he has ever been in his role. Peeta has a very big part of the plot and Hutcherson is good. I've always thought Liam Hemsworth got the short end of the stick in this series. His Gale always seems to be a secondary character and gets very little respect and this film doesn't help that any. He is good in the part but the character seems wasted somehow and always gets shafted by Katniss. One of my favourite actors from the original two films takes a back seat and that's Woody Harrelson and its unfortunate. Haymitch has always been an amazing character and he's hardly in this film sadly. Donald Sutherland returns as President Snow and is amazing at it. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman also has a significant role as Plutarch and he has some very good lines and a good presence on the cast. Newcomers on the cast include Julianne Moore (she has been popping up everywhere lately) and while I always say she is one of my least favourite actresses, she seems to be growing on me ever so slightly and she is actually very effective as the leader of the rebellion. Mahershala Ali is very good in an unfortunately very small role and I hope he has a bigger part in the final film. Jeffrey Wright, Willow Shields and Elizabeth Banks all return in small roles.An IMDb reviewer described this as a great advertisement for what is left to come. That is truly a backhanded complimented but that is exactly what this is. There are so many characters and yet some of the best characters (Haymitch, Gale, Beetee, Finnick, Caesar, Effie and Johanna) just to name a few, are very underused and solely lacking. I am very impressed that director Francis Lawrence has an incredible eye for stunning sequences. Catching Fire had some great action scenes and Mockingjay has even more powerful and moving scenes that are very nearly awe inspiring. Lawrence comes almost exclusively from music videos which I find usually means their experience is lacking but Lawrence seems to have a firm handling of this science fiction epic and the characters and while I still don't think this instalment is necessary, it was enjoyable and a good holdover until the final film. Often powerful and moving and a lot of politics which makes for a fascinating story. It might not be at the level of the first two films but its still one of the best franchises in a very long time. 8/10",8,2,13,4 January 2015
Vertigo," Terrifyingly brilliant or terrifyingly awful...I think I lost my mind for two hours in psychosis
","I am not a Hitchcock aficionado, in fact I have only ever seen one or two of his films, the obvious more mainstream ones. I thought I had seen Vertigo before but I had not. So I went to see it on the big screen in a classic film series. Well...I've been Hitchcocked. There were times I thought I was losing my mind. The film is mind numbing and I do not know whether that is good or bad. Every time I thought the film was ending, it kept going. Unlike some classic films, I didn't feel like Vertigo has aged well. I felt like parts of it come across as incredibly campy now and cheesy including the animation of Johnny's dream sequence. The film is appropriately haunting as you would expect from Hitchcock and the twist for me was actually a lot of fun, although again it seemed completely implausible. It seemed like Vertigo tried to be about five different genres of film and certainly covered a gambit of concepts. Obsession, lust, murder, the supernatural, reincarnation, and all with the opening scene of a detective afraid of heights. I think I would need a student of film to explain to me what on earth his vertigo had to with the film whatsoever. Yes, it ended up playing a role in the climax but was it necessary? The film was more about obsession than anything to do with vertigo.I love Jimmy Stewart, adore him in fact. He is a poignant and powerful presence in any role and this is no exception. Anyone else in the role would have let it falter. His character literally loses his mind throughout the course of the film and deals with the obsession, and the illness and the mental instability and its frightening to watch him do it. His character is bizarre and he pulls it off with class. I don't know a lot about Hitchcock and his blonde bombshells but was Kim Novak a complete joke in this film? I don't know if its the age of the performance but she reeked of pretentious sarcasm and downright campy performance. Her scenes were literally laughable and she looked ridiculous in nearly every scene. To call her performance overacting is the understatement of the decade. She overacts every scene and every expression and it was painful to watch right up to her laugh out loud climax. Barbara Bel Geddes (my beloved Miss Ellie--I'm a Dallas fan) plays a bizarre little role as Stewart's best friend and unrequited love interest Midge. I say its bizarre because their relationship is left unexplored and you feel like there is so much history there that you never get to see anything from. Still Geddes is perfect and her and Stewart have this unusual but palpable chemistry on screen together. Tom Helmore plays his part very well and he and Stewart also have good chemistry on screen together during their one major scene. Stewart carries the film though and easily.I don't pretend to understand Hitchcock and I don't even begin to have the pretentiousness to presume I should say what is good or bad about one of the most iconic directors in history. The film just hurt my brain trying to figure out what it was he was doing. The SanFrancisco backdrop seemed to play such a significant part of the whole concept but yet was never really used to any great degree. In a couple of scenes Stewart is clearing driving on the wrong side of the road...why?! Was this just a mistake or an inversion of film? Or was there a deeper meaning. I kept trying to see Hitchcock's trademark brilliance but I'm not sure I understand. I wasn't intrigued as much as I was confused and I wasn't entertained as much as I was terrified by how overwhelming the whole experience was. I don't mean to take away anything from those that adore the film but I would just like to sit down and debate/discuss this movie for hours. It isn't anything I would seek out for entertainment but I intend on exploring Hitchcock's films more in the weeks to come. I am so glad I saw this because I can say that I've seen it and got to see it on the big screen!! 6/10",6,0,3,13 January 2013
Black Swan," Wow....and not in a good way...What the...???
","You can't go anywhere without hearing about Black Swan. Reviewers on here say 'Perfect', 'A Nightmarish Brilliant Piece', 'the best movie of the year' and it seems destined to score Academy Awards especially for its star. Even my 75 year old father loved it so I thought it was just going to be spectacular. It stared out promising enough making me cringe at the brutal lengths the determined dancer goes through and then it started to make me cringe at how terrible it was turning out to be. Black Swan in my honest opinion was absolute garbage. It was one of those artsy movies that I hate more because everyone loves it because its the 'In thing' to do. Yes the film is unique, gritty, twisted, and dark but it just continually makes you scratch your head and laugh out loud at the sheer absurdity of the film. I looked around at the other theatre goers who were enthralled and devastated by the emotion and I wanted to start laughing because the film is so completely absurd, it isn't emotion, its silly. Maybe there was a lot of expectation going into this but I hope to never see this film again. It aims for shocking and the only thing shocking is how much everyone loves it.Natalie Portman gives a solid performance. She is probably the sole reason I managed to squeeze a 4/10 for this film. But Portman is a great actress. Her descent into madness is silly but her performance is honest and she really does a good job handling the insanity. Mila Kunis is doing a good job breaking out her career although she seems to struggle finding the right role. Her role in this film is not a big stretch for her. I think its probably pretty close to her true personality as far as being strong and outspoken. Really she is a more mature 'Jackie' (her character from That Seventies Show.) Her and Portman don't have great chemistry and while Portman is giving this role her all, Kunis is far too laid back. Vincent Cassel also gives a solid performance as the dictating and disturbing Ballet director. Cassel has good chemistry with Portman and gives probably the second best performance in the film. Unfortunate given how disturbingly stupid the movie is. Barbara Hershey could be good, in fact she does raise the standard of the cast but then some of the bizarre twists in her behaviour makes it even stranger. What's with the breakdown over the cake? She's just odd. In true Winona Ryder style as of late she shows up in an odd cameo showing plenty of twisted emotion but its too late to redeem her performance in the film.Some people will say that I didn't 'get' this movie and I do get it. Portman's character's emotional crash reflects that of the Swan Queen in Swan Lake as she pushes herself to a breakdown. I also know that Darren Aronofsky is not known for run of the mill mainstream films although I have only seen a couple of his films. How scary is it that he's tied to direct the next Wolverine film? The cold hard fact of this film is that there is too much bizarre and absurd all thrown in at once. It comes at you like a freight train. You're watching this dancer who is so insanely driven to be perfect and then suddenly...visions, scratching open her skin, paintings moving, drug hallucinations, murder, suicide...it just is overwhelming. I suppose because so many are raving and critics are in love that film fans should go see this but for me this was simply a huge waste of time. Given the sexual tones of the film it isn't even gratuitous. I'll be crossing my fingers for the academy to bypass this one because there has to be better films this year! Although I don't suppose Jason Statham will ever get nominated. 4/10",4,13,23,17 February 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Kudos for turning around the spiral...maybe Pirates can still survive
","Curse of the Black Pearl was one of the most brilliant adventures I had ever seen. Unique and huge and made Pirates the coolest thing out there and Johnny Depp created one of the greatest anti-hero characters in film history. And then the original trilogy began to spiral down into clutter and confusion and lost all that heart that came from the original. Still the original was amazing enough that I really did want to see this newest, long awaited instalment. I was even more excited that Johnny Depp and the film makers made clear they were trying to take this back to their roots. Clearly they knew that despite the BILLIONS of dollars the original trilogy made there was some serious clutter starting. So they made Jack Sparrow the main focus, threw in some new characters and took him on the high seas in a new adventure. Well done for turning it around. Does it touch the original? Not even close. I felt like maybe it was a little too basic and they even maybe played it too careful (I know darned if you do and darned if you don't) but there definitely was a spark still missing. However, the film is terrific and fun and adventurous and you don't miss the characters of Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) or Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) because Depp clearly carries the film.You really can't say a single bad thing about Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He has the character down to a fine science and while I think he's lost his unique and fun edge it is still always great to go on this adventure with him. Depp is flawless and a movie star in every sense of the word. Even if the series continues to get worse I have no doubt that Depp's Sparrow will be brilliant. Penélope Cruz has proved to be a very versatile actress and this is a good turn for her. Taking on the strong female swashbuckler and former love of Sparrow, Angelica is fun and her and Depp have amazing chemistry together. She fits right into the story and into the cast. Geoffrey Rush returns in his terrific role as the over bearing pirate Barbossa. I have loved this character since day one. I felt like he was a little low key in this film and him and Jack didn't have as much banter against each other which always made for great moments in the original trilogy. Ian McShane joins the cast as the legendary Blackbeard and who better to do it. I mean McShane sort of gets type-casted in this type of villain but he is still perfect for Blackbeard. Kevin McNally also returns in his role as Jack's number one man, but he is sadly underused and almost feels like he was only forced into the story to have a returning character.Gore Verbinski is not a seasoned director but he is incredibly talented. I feel like Rob Marshall is a step down from having Verbinski's vision behind the camera. Marshall's career has been successful but focusing on musicals (Chicago) and a time piece like Memoirs of a Geisha. That doesn't really translate into swashbuckling adventure. On Stranger Tides is a good film, it is a welcome turn around to the series but the problem is I felt like everything was just a little too low key. The original Pirates film was in your face, over the top, action adventure that held no punches and I just thought that On Stranger Tides played it safe, and didn't really let loose but maybe that was purposeful to try and pull the reigns back and stop the series from becoming a cluttered mess. Regardless if you liked the original trilogy this one will be welcomed as well. Kids will love the adventure and adults will love the characters. Worth seeing, but a far cry from the original film. 8/10",8,0,1,7 August 2011
Men in Black 3," It's Men In Black, you know how it goes, well this is more of it
","I am a bad person to review a Men In Black film because honestly I didn't care much for the first two. They were okay and had some fun moments and some good special effects but for whatever reason they just didn't resonate with me. I love the cast and the concept but they never impressed me much. If you loved the first two Men In Black films then you will love this one, plain and simple. They came back after a ten year hiatus and nailed it. It feels the same, looks the same and probably just as enjoyable as the first two if you liked them. I thought the comedy took a back seat in this instalment, it just didn't feel like it had the same level of comedic one liners that the other ones had. The cast is as good as they have ever been and the story is decent. For whatever reason, the x factor, still didn't resonate with me but I still enjoyed it or what it was. Men In Black 3 is and the series always was silly fun and it continues to be the same.I sincerely miss seeing Will Smith on the big screen. I think both him and Tommy Lee Jones are far too good of actors to be in this sort of film but that is probably what makes them so popular. Smith is good in his role, seems to slip back into the role easily. As I mentioned the comedy is toned down which doesn't fare well for Smith's character who always delivered the one liners to Jones' straight man. Tommy Lee Jones, as I expected, isn't in this film as much as the others. The concept is that Smith teams up with a younger version of Jones' Agent K. Jones is still good as the straight laced, by the book agent. Josh Brolin steals the show with his performance playing a younger Agent K. He absolutely nails Tommy Lee Jones and this is probably the first time in a film where I believed a younger actor was the younger version. He just completely delivers and Smith and Brolin have the same chemistry as Smith and Jones. They could not have cast this part any better. Jemaine Clement is also very good as the bad guy, Boris. He really does a great job playing the main villain. Emma Thompson and Alice Eve have small roles playing the same character and they do alright as well. It never hurts seeing Alice Eve in a film as she is stunningly beautiful but a mediocre actress.I don't think the film would have been nearly as successful had director Barry Sonnenfeld not returned. He knows the cast and the story well and he does sci-fi comedy flawlessly. He is excellent at creating entertaining but properly campy stories. I think fans of the series will only be mildly disappointed by two things. The lack of comedy in this one and the lack of unique critters, creatures and aliens. Yes there are some but it just didn't have the same level of unique flare that the first film had or even the second. I suppose that is to be expected though with a trilogy and one that took ten years to make. Still it was entertaining and while I didn't love it because of my own Men In Black hang ups, I think fans will really enjoy it and its worth checking out certainly. 7/10",7,0,2,1 December 2012
Scarface," Riveting, sweeping, violent...masterpiece
","Well here I am....1500 reviews. Clearly I watch too many movies...and couldn't care less. I love them, eat them up and I've seen many amazing (and many awful) and even more in between those two films in the last 1500. The last few milestones of reviews I've hit I was determined to watch and review Scarface because its one of those movies that people go 'You haven't SEEN that!!' Nope I hadn't seen it. But I knew 1500 was going to be it, I was going to watch THEE Scarface. I heard good things, I heard terrible things so I went in with mixed expectations. I knew there was the possibility of me hating it, but I didn't, not for a minute.Scarface is not a perfect experience and I absolutely understand why some people don't like it. Its a massive film clocking in at (what I believe is a mostly unnecessary) 3 hours. There is a lot of business, a lot of dialogue, and as one review pointed out it is quintessential 80's. It reeks of the 80's from the mostly unknown, less popular soundtrack, to the clothing, to the Discotheques and beyond. Parts of it do indeed seem unintentionally funny or at least satirical and because this film is such an indelible piece of pop culture history it has been made fun of to death so its almost hard to see the seriousness in it. All of the above I mentioned could be a negative review or it could be reasons some people love it...like me. I was completely entranced by the twisted and disturbing plight of Tony Montana. Al Pacino is completely jaw dropping (more on that in a moment.) Gamers like myself who sunk thousands of hours into Grand Theft Auto 3 will find themselves reminiscing fondly by the music in the film. I only mention that because Scarface is very clearly the inspiration for every Grand Theft Auto video game (a series I hold near and dear above all others.) The setting of Miami makes for a vibrant, neon filled, 80's dream and only makes the violent turmoil all the more vivid. Honestly, for as shocking as I heard Scarface was I didn't think it was top of the pile for violence, language or nudity. There are absolutely some violent scenes, some of the most memorable and iconic I've ever seen but to put it as any sort of exploitation film would be pushing it.Would this film have been the same without Al Pacino? I honestly don't think so. He is Tony Montana. He brings him to life and uses every ounce of his incredible charisma to make a character that will forever be remembered. His rise from low level Cuban refugee to drug Kingpin is unforgettable. By the end of the film you literally feel disgust for him (which is the point) and he embodies the iconic film character. I already loved Pacino but to finally see him in one of his most revered roles was terrific. Steven Bauer is the ultimate sidekick. He is in nearly every scene with Pacino but unfortunately for him he gets buried by the performance of Pacino. Still he is there to support Tony and he does that. He is memorable, gives a subtle solid performance and is very good. Michelle Pfeiffer is okay. She is actually the weakest link in the film. Her character is very prissy and irritating and very stand offish. That is the point but it makes her hard to relate to or appreciate. Her chemistry with Pacino is average at best and she doesn't add much to the story. I actually didn't even realize she was in this and that's not surprising because she is forgettable. The supporting cast includes very good performances from Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Robert Loggia and F. Murray Abraham.I suppose it is worth giving kudos to director Brian DePalma and Oliver Stone (who wrote the film) that this was obviously an epic project for them. They fought with ratings boards and fought to keep the film exactly the way they wanted it. The problem is that it drags significantly once Tony 'gets made' so to speak and his downfall in the last hour of the film. It almost feels like the film starts to fall apart a little bit towards the end or perhaps they were rushing to finish this epic story. Certainly Peter Jackson would have split this into three parts and rightfully so in some ways. It simply feels like more time is spent in the first two hours and then the last hour rushes into his infamous demise. The film is still captivating, a sweeping crime epic that others have constantly tried to live up to. It is a dark, very dark, twisted, disturbing dramatic bio-pic that I am so glad I finally saw. You can absolutely feel the intensity in each scene and you can just see all the elements that have made it a stone cold classic. The build up to finally seeing and hearing the iconic 'SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND' was unbearable. I had never seen it in context and have seen it mocked time and time again...was I let down when I finally witnessed it? Nope. Epic conclusion to a truly classic film with minor flaws. 9.5/10",9,0,2,14 January 2014
Frost_Nixon," A disturbing look at a very real time in history...captivating film with a powerhouse performance
","I will agree and disagree with much of what reviewers and critics say about Frost/Nixon. I have a sincere love for American Politics and have studied Richard Nixon to extent but I am only thirty so I missed the entire Watergate phenomenon and subsequent fallout. I eagerly awaited to see this film only having previous experience of a serious Richard Nixon performance from the legendary Anthony Hopkins. Frost/Nixon doesn't try to force itself into some sort of dramatic film but instead plays the situation real which is both impressive and discouraging because the entire film is riveting and yet doesn't have a deep plot. It's a surface film about an interview and a conceited, self important TV personality who nails the world's most desired Interview. Ultimately from this film (I have yet to see the actual interviews) Frost didn't really nail anything down until the final moments of the interview. Still the set up and the anticipation of the interview and the one truly mind blowing performance of the film make it the type of thing you can't take your eyes off of. The film still didn't really blow me away with the exception of that one performance.Michael Sheen is a terrific actor. He can do some incredible performances but in all honesty I didn't see it in this one. I don't know how much he is given to work with as Australian TV personality David Frost but he is supposed to be very charismatic and I just don't get that from his performance. It's almost bordering on bland compared to his co-star. Now let's talk about that co-star. If this film scores an eight for me Frank Langella's performance is a perfect shining ten. Langella as Richard M. Nixon is breath taking. I didn't think he could come close to Hopkins' performance but he nails it and is brilliant. If the story is a little dull then Langella makes the film stone cold watchable. He is brilliant. You absolutely must see him pull off this performance!! He buries anyone else in the film. Sam Rockwell, Kevin Bacon, and Oliver Platt also add some style and humor to the film as well. Platt in particular seems to be the comic relief which in some ways kind of feels out of place in the context of a very serious film.It seems almost an understatement to say that Ron Howard is a brilliant director. He has done some amazing films and he knows how to tell a story. He has done every genre imaginable and he helps tell the story as well. His films tend to show an unprecedented feeling of intensity and Frost/Nixon proves that. Again the story for the film is simplistic enough but ultimately it is telling the story of the aftermath of Richard Nixon the man. When you watch the film watch it from the perspective of it being a story about Richard Nixon specifically and not the interviews. One of the most powerful movie scenes I have seen in ages is Nixon's late night phone call to Frost where he appears to be showing some of his rumored paranoia and break in psyche. Considering the award nominations, any movie fan should see this but if not for that reason then see if for the truly amazing performance by Frank Langella and a piece of American history from a different perspective. 8/10",8,2,5,26 January 2009
Walk the Line," One of the best Bio films ever made
","I wouldn't call myself a Johnny Cash fan, my Dad always was so I knew his music and a little about him but the trailers looked good so off I went and I was blown away!! I can't say I was a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix either although I must admit he's been in some of my favorite films and did well (Gladiator, Signs.) His performance as the late Man In Black Johnny Cash was incredible. The film chronicles everything from Cash's childhood upbringing, the loss of his big brother and his relationship with his father throughout his starting years as a superstar. Drug addiction, his first marriage, his handling of fame, and best and most of all...his music. I would almost classify this film as a musical it's so full of Cash's music. It's beautiful and brilliant. Even if you're not a big fan you'll recognize some of his bigger hits and they don't overplay the songs they are just such a huge component of the film!! The script is riveting and nothing is overdone, the pace of the film is downright brilliant and every minute is worthwhile and intriguing. Next to the music the next best thing is the incredible romance in this story. This film will appeal to the absolute best of romantic fans out there. Cash's relationship, friendship and love with his future wife (of more than 35 years) June Carter is beautiful and handled with such grace and intensity and done with the perfect amount of pace. You feel everything about them. June Carter is played with equal fervor by Reese Witherspoon, probably one of the biggest stars in the film. Although I can't say the role is a big stretch for her, being she is from the south and grew up with the same influences she does an amazing job as the fire cracker June Carter. It chronicles her first two marriages, her children, her caring for everyone around her and her desire to save her best friends life (Cash.) So much is covered in the film but it never feels forced together and rushed. This is without a doubt James Mangold's best work as director and writer. He must be an enormous Cash fan because this film was made with such passion and heart. Other notable appearances are Robert Patrick as Cash's overbearing, rather harsh father, and Ginnifer Goodwin as Cash's first wife Vivian. Some of Cash's children are speaking out against this film supposedly because of the portrayal of their mother Vivian saying it shows her to be jealous of Cash's career but I didn't get that at all!! If it painted anyone in a bad light, in those early days, it was Cash himself. He was a poor husband, drug addicted and nearly abusive. I did think at times that the character of Vivian was portrayed a little shallow and without any real substance but Goodwin did a good job.I honestly would have still been blown away by this film has Phoenix and Witherspoon lip synced every line but they DIDN'T!! Both of them spent months in vocal training and instrument training and nailed these performances. Together their chemistry was unstoppable, possibly one of the best on screen duos to date which truly captured Cash and Carter and their relationship. Their performances and singing were absolutely astounding!! This film rivals and overtakes last years brilliant bio 'RAY' starring the incredible Jamie Foxx so if you liked Ray you absolutely must see Walk The Line. This film is an instant classic and I would love to see an Academy Award sweep because it's well deserved. The best film I have seen in ages and one of my favorites from now on!!

Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Honestly...what is to be said about Borat...it's exactly what it claims to be...and it is FUNNY!!
","Borat is now probably cinema legend. Crude...through the roof...offensive...yep definitely...silly, yeah plenty of that, but somehow...in some sick twisted way Borat manages to be funny, possibly one of the funniest crude films I've ever seen and I'm not a big fan of comedies let alone crude comedies. It just seems to work for Borat and part of that is because I insist on believing that there was some sort of social message that the film maker was trying to make with this over the top, rendition of a newcomer to America. I think he was trying to show us exactly how foolish we looked when presented with very taboo situations like homosexuality, religion, war, violence, American way of life...and he pulled that off flawlessly which made it all the more funny. If anyone ever thought you could have crude, disgusting humor with a point...Sacha Baron Cohen actually pulls it off and I'll give him credit for that.Sacha Baron Cohen is Borat. He completely embodies his infamous character and makes him an actual person to us. He travels to America from his own country of Kazakhstan to document American way of life and in the process discovers the love of his life in Pamela Anderson and treks across the country to find her stopping and carrying on wild interviews and situations with 'real' people and Americans. I insist that some of it had to have been set up but the reality of Cohen doing this to real people made it downright hilarious and gave Borat it's heart. In most ways Borat is disgusting, uncivilized, under educated and yet you feel compassion for him because this is his way of life and he doesn't understand what other people do. Then on the flip side anyone who knows the story behind this film knows that Cohen is tricking these people and that's really the way you see Borat. I don't think anyone who knows and understands this film actually sees Borat as a character or anyone remotely real. Ken Davitian is Borat's partner in crime and fellow Kazakhstani Azamat Bagatov who follows him as his producer through his exploits. Davitian basically uses his physical appearance as comedy for the most part and plays as Cohen's straight man but does a decent job doing that. Basically the rest of the film for the most part is 'real' unsuspecting victims of Cohen's comedy bit and parts of it seem real and then you wonder how they could be duped by such an overdone character. Pamela Anderson also makes an appearance as herself but it's generally considered fact that her scenes were planned and staged.Weak of stomach or heart and easily offended should stay 100 miles from this film because it does have it's share of down right raunchy comedy, disgusting moments, and really harsh racism and sexual opinions. It's not that I am not offended but I look at it differently and actually found many of the scenes amusing but from a perspective of Cohen setting them up. Borat is mercifully short, less than an hour and a half because I don't believe anyone could take any more of Borat than that but the deleted scenes on the DVD are well worth seeing as well because there is even more interactions with real people. Those who like disgusting comedy will find Borat roll in the aisles funny but I think even people who can see the film as more of a spoof and trying to make a point might get a good laugh out of it as well. I would never say the film is brilliant or worth seeing twice but the film is worth seeing to get a smile out of the tough skinned individuals out there. 7/10",7,19,35,2 March 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Decent sequel but a muddled story holds it back
","What made Robert Downey Jr.'s Sherlock Holmes revival two years ago so unique was the style and finesse and the gadgets and action and story and everything just worked so well. It was one of the action movie greats for the year and I had a lot of anticipated for the sequel that would introduce us to Sherlock Holmes' one and only nemesis Dr. Moriarity. The first film was primed for a great sequel. Game of Shadows made a lot of mistakes, I think, but some of the things that made the first movie great saved this from being a complete disaster. Let's talk about the good stuff first. Holmes' manic and often disturbing way of solving the crime, putting together clues and going to exorbitant means to catch the bad guy is as fun as it ever was. The chemistry between Holmes and Watson, while not as good as the first, is still a ton of fun! Where the film falls short is the story is way more complex than necessary, in fact it is almost confusing at times though by the end it does come together reasonably well. And I also felt like finally the unveiling of Moriarity was a bit of a let down as I didn't think he was quite the epic nemesis I had hoped for.Robert Downey Jr. is fantastic as Holmes. To be honest Downey Jr. is fantastic in almost any role. But he goes above and beyond playing the manic, head case who happens to also be completely brilliant. He also pulls of his action scenes flawlessly. Jude Law is terrific as Watson but as I said I think perhaps his character had a little more depth and was just a little bit better as a character in the first film. Him and Downey Jr. had such incredible chemistry in the first film and while it was still there it wasn't quite as good. I don't think this script gave Jude Law as much depth. Noomi Rapace, I'm just laying it out there, was awful in her role. I don't know if its her fault or the script but her character was pointless, vapid, and zero chemistry on screen. Jared Harris as Moriarity was disappointing for me. He didn't exude the evil master mind like I would have expected. I would have liked to have seen a powerful big name actor, someone known for villains, take the role. I thought the chemistry was virtually non-existent between him and Downey's Sherlock Holmes. The addition of Stephen Fry as Holmes' brother was a welcome newcomer. He had some funny moments in the film even if some of them seemed just slightly out of place.Guy Ritchie has a reputation for a certain style of film and he did a great job on the first film. Why he decided that practically every action scene in this movie required slow motion is beyond me. He uses slow motion so much that it becomes a joke and is overwhelmingly annoying. It really is Downey Jr. that saves the film with his performance along with decent action. If you loved the first movie than you will enjoy the second but don't expect the same level of solid action that came out of the first. A valid effort with some stumbling. Hopefully they pull it together for a third! 7/10",7,0,0,17 January 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Completely obliterates Ang Lee's mistake and makes it right in a big way!!
","I am going to re-watch Ang Lee's Hulk generally considered disastrous by fans so I can review it properly but I seem to remember it being pretty awful and in no way an homage to the monstrous hero that fans love. Now I'm not a huge Marvel fan by any means but I love the hero movie and they needed to redeem Hulk and The Incredible Hulk redeemed him and then some. This was the true Hulk film that fans would have wanted and now we can firmly pretend HULK never existed. Relatively new director Louis Leterrier takes the helm and makes Ang Lee look like an amateur and clearly Leterrier must be a Hulk fan or at least turned to enormous Hulk fans because this had everything. The film paid huge homage to the original 70's/80's series which I think is just incredible. It used the music from the original series on one or two occasions, Edward Norton seemed to really channel and pay respect to Bill Bixby's Banner character and his transformation definitely leaned towards that. Terrific cameos from Stan Lee (as always), the original Hulk himself Lou Ferrigno in a terrific and funny cameo that felt like a hand over of the Hulk reigns (although it was only coffee), Robert Downey Jr., and mentions of Stark Industries (Iron Man), the Super Soldier program (Captain America) and other terrific Easter Eggs.Edward Norton is an amazing actor although he's slipped from high profile in the last few years. He really channels the fugitive scientist looking for a cure part really well and does an amazing job. He's such a non-assuming almost mousy character which is far more like Bill Bixby's Banner than Eric Bana's character in the original Hulk film. Norton is ideal in the role although he may not return in future installments. Liv Tyler is Betsy Ross, Banner's love interest. This is her second summer flick and decisively better performance than The Strangers (although it was a great scare flick.) She gives a better all around performance and has great chemistry with Norton although she is still whiny at times. Tim Roth is a terrific villain, completely on part with other Hero villains that were great. Although his true villainous performance is CGI he still does a great job setting up the character. William Hurt who is a seasoned and often talented character actor does an okay job as General Ross. There is just something missing from the performance. He doesn't seem to have his heart in it and yet he could do very well and is a decent nemesis to Norton's Banner.Many ask what is better Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk. I mean Iron Man really told a great story and established the character whereas The Incredible Hulk took the liberty of summarizing the establishment of the character in the opening credits but mostly assumed we all know how it all began and puts you right into the action. The story in The Incredible Hulk is simplistic and it's all about two hours of The Hulk smashing stuff and that is wicked cool. I just about giggled and clapped when the Hulk actually exclaims 'HULK SMASH' in one of his rage filled riots. The Incredible Hulk is the perfect summer blockbuster and is already racing to the top of the charts which is good because it is a worthy super hero action flick that anyone should see. Forget the disaster of HULK and go see this because his redemption is super sweet!! 9/10",9,13,24,23 June 2008
The Monuments Men," Interesting story but perhaps too much ego/charisma in one film?
","The Monuments Men is a fascinating project. On one hand it is a really interesting twist on a World War 2 story. On the other hand I'm not sure it was enough to create a two hour film around. Clooney is talented in many ways and while I've never been a huge fan of his I can't deny his talent and charisma in Hollywood. There are some genuinely moving moments in the film but it also struggles to capture the sort of intensity and emotional upheaval of the war though it does try. The subject matter is almost too light given the setting. It doesn't have near the range of intensity of films like Warhorse or Schindler's List. This cast is very near stunning. However, part of that problem might be too many stars and not enough coverage for their characters and time for them to do what we all love them to do best. The film makers may have been better off finding a smaller, lesser known cast to tell this story. Still, the unique angle and the fun chemistry between the cast makes for an entertaining and decent World War 2 picture. I felt like, despite it being delayed for several months, the script and direction could have used a little fine tuning or something more added.As I said George Clooney is very hit and miss for me. I know how talented he is and he is the epitome of modern day Hollywood royalty and I respect him for that. I have seen in roles I've loved and some I've hated and everywhere in between. I don't know where this performance sits because he definitely tones it back to make room for the other stars but maybe he's toned back too much. He doesn't make much of a splash and his performance is almost boring at times which is unfortunate. Matt Damon was one of the better characters but also was victim to getting not enough development. He provides some moments of one-liner humour which still seems strange to me but somehow it works. Clooney and he definitely have good chemistry and that helps. The supporting cast in the film are all terrific but none of them get the screen time they deserve and they all seem to have terrific back stories that we never really get to find out about. Bill Murray, John Goodman, Jean Dujardin, Hugh Bonneville and Bob Balaban all have one or two great scenes and together they are terrific but there is too many of them and not enough space for their stories. There is this hint of this clever and fun little rivalry between Balaban and Murray but that never takes off and the back story of Bonneville is great but we never really get to explore that and Dujardin's heroic tale gets mostly lost. Literally the actress I cannot stand most in the world (just edging out Jessica Chastain) is Cate Blanchett. She is the most over-rated and irritating actress. Fortunately her role in this is nearly pointless and she hardly gets any time to get under my skin. She is forgettable at best in this film. There is a whole sub story between her and Damon that never goes anywhere either.It may seem like I'm trashing this movie and I don't mean to. There were good scenes, some fun and some touching moments but nothing is as powerful as it should be because its simply too crowded with cast and story and not enough depth to the important things. This would have made a heck of a TV series with Spielberg behind it because they could have explored these great characters. The script is actually very good but not right for a feature length film. Production value is excellent and two scenes that stand out is Damon and his landmine incident and the very moving scene in the middle of the film with a melancholy Christmas carol playing. This cast is grade A superb and none of the faults of this film are on them. It just could have been so much more. Perhaps it was rushed after all. Still you won't be disappointed per se and it you will enjoy it but it won't blow very many people away and for being what it is, I think it will mostly be forgettable which is unfortunate to me. 7/10",7,0,0,22 May 2014
Miracle," Disney strikes ANOTHER emotional chord with a powerful moment in history
","I'm not a big sports fanatic and yet I keep falling in love with these incredible emotionally powerful and moving sports films, specifically Disney's as of late. The deeply moving, touching and just plain nice Greatest Game Ever Played and now finally I get around to seeing 2004's Miracle. Miracle was quite simply incredible. Well acted, beautifully directed, powerful, invigorating and touching. People certainly consider it controversial calling the film historically inaccurate, American driven, and over hyped and perhaps it is but I don't think they are seeing the real story and message behind those games. This was the end of an era. The Cold war raged for nearly five decades and this was like the pinnacle of the average American's involvement with the Cold War. This was a team that was going to take on the most powerful nation in the world not in war but in sport on ice, with rules. Fairly newcomer and unknown director Gavin O'Connor does an absolutely brilliant job of recapturing the spirit and turbulence of the seventies moving towards the end of the cold war. On top of making you remember those days and the seventies from politics to sports to the average person's life he manages to bring out this incredible story of people, a team and a Coach who would do anything to get this team that medal.Kurt Russell plays tough as nails Coach Herb Brooks. Hands down Russell gives an Oscar Worthy performance. He was robbed because I am certain he belonged up there. His performance as Herb Brooks is moving and so diverse. We see every angle of him, his passion for hockey, his love for his family, and his utter raw determination to train this team to be the best in the world through all odds. Russell is as good for the team as he is downright cruel but his methods are all for good reason as we see. Any Russell fan as I am NEEDS to see this movie. He is incredible. He is by far the star and stand out performance in the film. Granted the film really is about him and Herb Brooks' story. The rest of the cast is very much supporting cast but they all do a great job. The hockey team in particular are all so important and I would love to list them all but sadly I won't. I will say though that they are all fantastic and they all have their moments. I have to mention Eddie Cahill, for a couple of reasons. First of all I am a huge CSI New York Fan which he is a regular cast member of. But more importantly he does a great job as intense goalie Jim Craig. Craig gets a bit more of a back story having his mother pass away and her wish for him to play for the Olympic team. Seeing Craig's father (Malcolm Stewart) at his final game cheering him on was moving!! Cahill's performance is moving and he is so intense and a powerful presence on screen. Patrick O'Brien Demsey, Kenneth Mitchell, Eric Peter-Kaiser, and Bobby Hanson are some of the more prominent members of the team and they are just fantastic. Much like the story of this team they are an on screen team. An ensemble cast who works together flawlessly. Noah Emmerich plays Assistant coach Craig Patrick and he is good. I found him a little low brow up against such powerful performances especially Russell but still he is a worthy addition to the cast.Miracle is a classic film, case closed. It goes into my books as one of my all time favorites. I won't ever forget Herb Brooks screaming...AGAIN!...and Craig Patrick reluctantly blowing his whistle to force the boys to do drills till they are literally sick. It captures an era, a moment in history of sports that won't ever be topped quite likely. A shining moment in US History and an important moment to many. Whatever people may say about Miracle it will give you shivers, make you smile, it's the feel good movie of the decade. I will watch this again and again and again...FANTASTIC!! 10/10",10,2,3,19 June 2006
Mission: Impossible III," The best movie so far, of the year ladies and gents!!
","I anxiously awaited Mission Impossible 3 because even the hint of a good action film excites me. But after a great first installment and then a very disappointing second installment, I didn't know what to expect. For the first time possibly in film history not only did Cruise and Wagner (producers) redeem the series but they brought it full circle and made a film BETTER than it's original which was incredible on it's own. Mission Impossible 3 just might be one of the best action films ever made PERIOD!! Also making it one of the best sequels ever PERIOD!! I thought maybe all the bad Tom Cruise press might make it's way into my head and cloud my judgment on the film but I came out with even more respect for Cruise who despite a publicized and annoyingly hounded personal life is probably one of the top actors out there today. On top of that new director to the series and TV Veteran J.J. Abrams breathed incredible new life into this series, giving the characters depth, and emotion, and humor, and unbelievable kick butt action scenes.Tom Cruise returns to his role as the sharper than nails Ethan Hunt. His droll and rather foolish days of MI:2 are behind him and the quick witted, fast moving Hunt of MI:1 returns in full force. Cruise is larger than life, always has been and Mission Impossible 3 proves exactly why. He's the most intense, and passionate action actor out there. Knowing he does all his own stunts and the look in his eyes in every scene...he's the definition of a leading man. Ving Rhames also returns in his capacity as Cruise's sidekick and tech man Luther Stickel. This time around Stickel and in fact Cruise's entire team have triple the personality and character that they had before. Stickel is used far better than ever before but still uses Hunt and Stickel's existing relationship. Rhames might not look the part but he fits in perfectly with the rest of the cast and even looks like he belongs beside Cruise. He's an integral part of the MI series. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a new member of the team playing Declan, the multi-talented spy who is almost a younger version of Hunt it would seem. Rhys Meyers is a great actor in his own right having had big roles in Match Point, and TV's Elvis. So he's a welcome addition to the cast and the team. I really hope he continues to come back (I'm assuming MI:4 is in the works...should be 2014 if the trend continues.) The Final new member of the team is quiet but limber Zhen played by Chinese action star Maggie Q. A small role bit significant enough to establish that together with Rhames and Meyers, this is the best team the MI series has ever had. I actually cared about the rest of the team. Although I just can't bring myself to connect him in the same league as Jon Voight and Anthony Hopkins...Laurence Fishburne plays the MI leader and the experience in the cast. Fishburne has an intensity unmatched and he brings that to Mission Impossible 3. Although he might not quite have the extreme pull of Hopkins or Voight he fits in nicely. Ethan's new wife and the love of his life Julia is played by the beautiful Michelle Monaghan. Although fairly new to being front and center of a film she does it perfectly and her and Cruise have incredible chemistry and you actually care about the two of them together. I think she has a promising career ahead of her as a leading lady. Finally despite her very small role I have to mention Felicity herself Keri Russell. She's always been hot but wow...you gotta go see this movie just to watch Felicity kick some serious ass!! The scene with her and Cruise escaping the warehouse is amazing and she is just awesome!! Her scenes end far too soon!! Now I have saved the best for last...the diabolical, incredibly twisted and evil...the best bad guy I have seen in YEARS on film....Owen Davian played by the incredible Philip Seymour Hoffman. On the heels of his Oscar winning role as Truman Capote he takes a completely different role in an action film and absolutely NAILS IT!! Hoffman is unbelievable!! He is a star and will remain a star especially knowing now he can flawlessly do action!! He is scary and disturbing and a great villain. He is the best adversary Ethan Hunt has had yet AND he absolutely flawlessly shares the screen with Tom Cruise!! Bravo to Hoffman!! What else can I say about this film?? I teetered on the line between a 9 and a perfect score and I have to go 10/10 not because the film is truly perfect but because of the way I FEEL about it. It's the best time I've had at the movies in a LONG LONG time. As I said before Abrams absolutely breathed new life into this series. He created everything Mission Impossible should be. Incredible, beautiful settings, globe trotting spy action and some very different different scenes. I think a little bit of sarcasm and humor is integral to a good action film and I think the screenwriters ALMOST overdid it...almost...but it fit nicely and it was a breath of fresh air and well delivered. As with any action film a certain amount of belief suspension is required and there are some awkward moments when things were shot a little strangely but it never once takes away from the film. Non-stop action doesn't even begin to describe this film, one explosion after another, absolutely hair raising escapes, fights, kidnappings, everything!!! A beautiful romance that is actually legitimately interesting and fun to watch, and with great actors. MI:3 is quiet simply incredible and you need to see the whole series but you HAVE to see the third installment!! Absolutely action classic!! 10/10",10,0,1,8 May 2006
Captain Phillips," Solid thriller that is more powerful being based on a true story
","In the last week I have seen both films that seem to be the frontrunners for some Oscar nods and both times I must admit I was a little underwhelmed although I should be used to that from Oscar contenders. Gravity was a colossal disappointment in a number of ways (see my review) and Captain Phillips let me down just a little as well. Now please don't get me wrong, both were entertaining and I did enjoy Captain Phillips. It had some riveting, edge of your seat thrills, a solid story and some truly great performances. That being said I thought it was a good movie, but not a great one. It didn't really evoke any huge emotions from me and as glad as I was to see Tom Hanks back on the big screen and he was good, he didn't truly shine until the last five minutes of the film but more on that in a moment. Certainly knowing this was based on a true story that wasn't so long ago it made the film even better. I cringed at the intense scenes and the actors who portrayed the pirates were good, though again I felt like they fell short of being truly great. The film was good all around but I supposed with all the hype about it I wanted GREAT! I wanted mind blowing and it didn't meet those expectations.I remember when I was completely convinced that Tom Hanks was thee greatest living actor in Hollywood. He can be funny, serious, intense, dramatic and romantic all at once. Forrest Gump, Philadelphia, Terminal...I could go on but those are some of my favourites...the man is a master of his craft. But it has been awhile since he's had a great role and this was a good role for him. He commanded the screen and was as good as he always is. The moment when he is rocketed into true Tom Hanks stardom is the last five minutes of the film. That sounds ludicrous but the scene of him being finally recovered and saved and his break down was moving and powerful and honestly if they gave him an Oscar based on that...then so be it. Its remarkable that the men playing the pirates are complete newcomers. I had heard what a remarkable job Barkhad Abdi as the leader of the group and he was good. I wouldn't say he was amazing but considering this is his first role, he isn't an actor by trade and he absolutely made the role authentic. The rest of the pirates played by Barkhad Abdirahman, Faysal Ahmed and Mahat M. Ali did a good job as well. All three are completely new to the big screen and they were perfect for their perspective roles. The only other notable role was that of Shane Murphy played by Michael Chernus. I actually thought his performance was very weak and felt forced and over-acted. Next to Hanks he seemed like an amateur and didn't fit the tone of the film very well unfortunately.Director Paul Greengrass absolutely liked gritty realism and uses his infamous chaotic shaking camera style which apparently a lot of people hate. It didn't bother me in Captain Phillips and I didn't find it overly obvious. 99% of the film is on the freighter or in the smaller life-raft and the pacing of the film is fine. I thought the scenes in the life-raft dragged just a little bit but a lot of time was spent in there so he was making sure the entire story was told. There is some controversy over whether or not Phillips was as heroic as the movie portrays him but this review is not about that, this is about the film and whether or not it entertains and it did. It is captivating, easy to watch and if you want a great survival thriller then this will fulfil that. Is it Oscar worthy? Not in my opinion. Its a solid movie that is being way over-rated in my humble opinion. Still worth checking out because it doesn't disappoint. Don't for a minute take this as a negative review, I simply want to address the accolades the film is receiving. All around good, falls short of greatness. 8/10",8,1,3,20 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Politically Epic Beginning
","I am treading on some dangerous ground here. Star Wars seems to be the most debatable of movie critiques. Some love it, some hate it, people are dead set harsh when it comes to their Star Wars. No matter what you have to give Lucas his props for bringing the Epic back after decades and starting it over with a prequel. When this first film was on the brink of being released I remember being immediately surprised as casting. Considering the original Star Wars was cast with virtual unknowns George Lucas chose to go with a much more main stream, and successful group of actors. Nonetheless they all seem to manage to put themselves into the Star Wars Universe quite flawlessly. Another surprise to me was the political undertone of the prequel films as the original films didn't have that.The Phantom Menace begins on the small planet of Naboo where the Trade Federation has taken the planet hostage at the encouragement of the mysterious Darth Sidious. The Trade Federation intends on forcing the Naboo leader Queen Amidala into signing a trade agreement outside of the Senate's rules and regulations, basically making The Naboo in complete control of The Trade Federation. Two Jedi's are dispatched to help with the negotiations of this hostile take over but the negotiations take a turn for the worse when The Trade Federation all out attacks Naboo and takes control of it. Amidala, accompanied by the two Jedi's head out to plead with The Senate to stop the invasion. On their way they must stop on a rowdy non-republic planet of tattooine to get parts for their ship. While searching for these parts Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn comes across a young slave boy with Jedi powers unlike any he has ever seen. Using their love for gambling Qui-Gon makes a bet in order to get the boy into his company and to get the parts for their ship. With the boy in his care they continue on to the Senate home planet of Coruscant where Amidala pleads with the Senate to save her people. Qui-Gon visits the Jedi Council to insist they allow him to train the boy in the Jedi Ways. The Council is hesitant sensing some fear and anger in this young boy. When the Senate fails to push through an answer to Amidala's pleas, she returns to Naboo to rally a race of beings called The Gungans to help her stage an attack against the Trade Federation and take back her planet. The attack works and together with the Gungans, Amidala and her small army take back the palace and capture the viceroy of The Trade Federation. Darth Sidious, not wanting to go down without a fight, sends his well trained apprentice Darth Maul to stop the Jedi's in a final battle.Liam Neeson as Master Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn does a great job. He fits in perfectly with everything around him and exudes confidence, and a headstrong attitude. We become very attached to his wise character. Ewan McGregor fills the shoes of Alec Guiness playing the young Obi Wan Kenobi. He also does a great job especially being he is playing a younger version of an already established Star Wars character. Natalie Portman plays the compassionate and fiery Queen Amidala. Her more emotional scenes are done without her saying anything. She shows a deep compassion for her people. At the same time she does her action scenes flawlessly. The young Anakin Skywalker...relative newcomer Jake Lloyd. His amateur acting does show through in several scenes but considering what he's been tasked with for this film he does an adequate job. One of the biggest accomplishments in my opinion is the way Lucas created the essence and beginning of a beautiful romance between the adult Queen Amidala and the young Anakin. They have more chemistry on screen then Hayden Christensen will share with her in the following film.One of the greatest things about Phantom Menace is being introduced and shown the beginnings of it all. Seeing C3P0 for the first time, seeing his meeting with his lifetime friend R2-D2 is just classic. Seeing the Jedi Council and the beginnings of what caused the Clone Wars which is mentioned in the original trilogy. One thing Phantom Menace doesn't fall short on is the action. The action sequences are still as tense and exciting as they ever were. In fact, in my opinion, Phantom Menace features two great film things. First if the amazing and incredibly unfortunately underused evil villain in Darth Maul. Darth Maul is darker than Vader in many ways and seemingly better trained in the Jedi ways. Couple that with a duel edged Light Sabre and he's downright awesome!! Unfortunately they chose to only utilize him for this film, and ended his reign quickly. Nonetheless that all happens after one of the greatest film battles of all time. Qui-Gon, and Obi-Wan take on Darth Maul on a catwalk similar and reminiscent of the battle between Vader and Luke in the earlier trilogy but different in many ways.I think I will agree that The Phantom Menace is not as perhaps brilliant as the original Star Wars but I think it does the series justice and fits into the brilliant epic just fine. You can't not see The Phantom Menace if you're gonna see the rest of the Star Wars films. Overall Lucas does a brilliant job as always and I won't deny him that. 7.5/10",7,1,2,23 May 2005
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," This series bottoms out into some of the worst cinema created
","I have honestly tried very hard to see what the fans see in this series. The first film was bad, and then the second two I managed to find some redeemable aspects in and now this one, part one of the two part 'epic' finale and I am simply blown away. This series has to go down in the history books as a mind blowing mass hypnosis that makes people believe what they are watching is epic. This film especially, Breaking Dawn Part 1, was absolutely utter garbage. It literally had one saving grace and that was the wedding and the Honeymoon locale was lovely to look at. The rest is junk. It is boring, poorly acted (as they all have been), horrifyingly lacking any depth or action and just simply awful. I don't get it, I don't understand how anyone can look at this film or the entire series and rave about it, or how it has made a billion plus dollars. I've examined it from every angle, I've looked for every possible redemptive quality and I see nothing. I also see review after review after review harping on it, saying how terrible it is, and if this were true then WHY IS IT MAKING SO MUCH MONEY!! How did we let this crap get made for five movies?!? I've said it before but I don't believe Robert Pattinson is necessarily a bad actor. I think this series will destroy any future career he has and same for the rest of them. He is awful, creepy, stupid looking, and boring in this film. He's a vampire that never does much of anything. Kristen Stewart's success in this film is how amazingly awful they make her look when she's suffering from her demon child. She actually looks quite beautiful in the first part of the film, the best she has ever looked but her character, as always, is boring and creepy. The chemistry between her and Pattinson is downright stupid and non-existent. Taylor Lautner returns to overact his way throughout the whole thing. Graciously he's in this film less and while he's always had better chemistry with Stewart than Pattinson, its still pointless. The rest of the Cullen/Swan/Wolf family all return in full vigor acting as bad as ever and keeping you barely awake through the whole film.I don't understand how director Bill Condon who has worked on far more serious projects, though none outstanding, could look at this script and think, 'Yes let's do this!' They have to know how completely awful this is. Maybe they just know that Twilight has millions of people mesmerized so it wouldn't matter what they'd do. As far as I'm concerned they could have played two hours of Edward picking Daisies and people would have reacted the same as they did to this film and it would have been equally as interesting. This was utter crap. Watch the first half hour for the wedding and some of the scenery and then turn it off and do yourself a favor and don't support this series anymore than it already is. This was really frightening at how bad a movie can be and still make money. 2/10",2,6,8,11 February 2012
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Brilliant! A near perfect coming of age film!
","I think Perks of Being A Wallflower finds its magic in the fact that the original mind that created the best selling book also penned the screenplay and directed the film. No one knows a writer's world better than the writer himself. On top of that I think the cast was meticulously chosen and happen to have truly incredible chemistry. I don't know what I expected from the movie, I had only seen a few trailers for the movie and next thing I knew I was completely enthralled, touched and moved. I think Perks of a Wallflower is to anyone who was teenager in the 90's what American Graffitti was to its generation. Yes I am comparing it to that classic. It was so perfectly crafted and without being obvious or blatant in its references to the 90's. I went to High School in the 90's and I felt connected to the characters and the world they lived in and I was blown way by how many things I spotted that were the exact same items I owned (maybe a sheer coincidence but it was very cool.) The copies of the books the lead character had were identical to the ones I once owned (or still own) in High School. Each character was so unique and so well cast that everyone stands out in their performance.I have always liked Logan Lerman but in a perfect world he would have gotten an Oscar nomination for his performance as the shy Charlie. Not only does Charlie struggle with fitting in but he suffers from having lost his best friend to suicide, sexual abuse as a child, and various mental health problems. His struggle truly strikes a chord and he is vibrant and just incredible on screen. Emma Watson shines as Sam. In her first major post Harry Potter role she is brilliant. I forgot all about her Hermoine days and she became Sam, Charlie's first love. Their chemistry is absolutely incredible and she is just perfect. Her role is subtle and yet her character captivating and struggling to find herself. Ezra Miller once again stunned me (he was brilliant in we Need To Talk About Kevin) as Sam's step-brother Patrick. He is also struggling to find his way in the world as a gay person. Now his character could have been incredibly cliché and predictable but it was anything but. All three of these actors made their characters come to life. You weren't watching a movie but rather watching these three young people find their way and struggle with their own very distinct personalities, trials, and tribulations. Nina Dobrev really impressed me in a small supporting role as Charlie's sister. She was excellent. The supporting cast were a lot of very familiar faces and they all did such a great job. Some of the roles were barely more than cameos and yet they were so effective. Definite honourable mentions to Paul Rudd and Tom Savini, who were so effective in their roles as High School teachers that I could have swore I personally had them both for classes. Mae Whitman, Erin Wilhelmi and Adam Hagenbuch did a terrific job at rounding out their group of friends. Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh were good as Charlie's parents but I would have liked to have seen more from them and more interaction with Charlie. Two great actors that go fairly underused.I think writer and director Stephen Chbosky has created one of the most brilliant coming of age films I have ever seen. I think this film will likely go very under-rated and I hope one day it rises as a classic like many films do. The soundtrack is brilliant because it perfectly takes you back without shoving the time period in your face. There is so much content and characters in the film but it never feels overwhelming. Every single thing just falls into place and is held together perfectly. I even toyed with slapping a perfect 10 on this movie and the only reason I am not is because I'm just not sure it will stand up to the test of time quite yet. But I can't express enough how brilliant I thought the movie was and Chbosky should be heralded for crafting such a well made movie. On the other hand, success is sometimes sheer luck and it just so happens this film has chemistry written all over it and the cast was so brilliant. I look forward to watching this again and again and certainly if you were a teenager in the 90's...this is your movie!! 9/10",9,4,7,13 February 2013
3:10 to Yuma," It won't rejuvenate the genre but fans will love it!!
","It wasn't until the last three years that I became an enormous Western fan so it was with great excitement that I drooled to see '310 To Yuma' the newest Western to hit the big screens in a long time. Although some reviewers hailed it as the rebirth of the Hollywood Western I won't go that far but for us Western starved fans it fulfilled my quota and there aren't many out there any more. The characters and actors that played them did a magnificent job and director James Mangold knows how to bring a story to life and really get the most out of his characters so that you become completely attached to them as he did with the outstanding Walk The Line as well as other of his films. He has only 7 film credits to his name and almost every one can be heralded as terrific stories. You can just tell he puts his heart and soul into it. Nonetheless he certainly makes sure that everything is in place that you would want from a Western. The villainy and the shootouts, and the small western town, the cattle farmer, the gangs, the sand and tumbleweeds, coach robberies, horses, camping under the stars and the railway. There isn't anything missing and you feel like you're immersed into this world and that is the key to a great Western.I do like Christian Bale. Please don't anyone think I don't. He has done some terrific work but I'm beginning to feel he might be slightly over rated. I thought his performance in Rescue Dawn (see my review) was ridiculous and over performed and I think I've come to realize he might just be someone who really over acts his roles. In 310 To Yuma he plays down on his luck family man and cattle farmer Dan Evans. He does a decent job but he just seems so hyped up and on edge that it's almost hard to watch him. I mean I understand he is playing a desperate man but still the performance was overdone I thought. Russell Crowe literally steals the show as absolutely notorious villain and killer Ben Wade. Crowe's Wade should probably be considered for Oscar Nominations because his suave, polite, and yet diabolically disturbing performance just draws you in and makes everything worth while. This is truly his best role in a long time!! I would love to see Ben Wade come back in a sequel with Crowe returning to the role. He is brilliant and him and Bale have good chemistry but I think it's more from Crowe's performance than Bale's. Terrific young character actor Ben Foster is Ben Wade's right hand man Charlie Prince. His character could have easily carried the film as the villain and he is just as terrifying in a far less subtle way than Crowe's character. Foster is terrific and I was convinced he would turn on Wade rather than stay loyal to the very end which is part of the irony of the film I think. The infamous in his own right Peter Fonda plays a small yet very important and distinguished role as a bounty hunter of sorts and Wade's long time nemesis. I would have absolutely loved to have seen Fonda and Crowe go head to head more than they did. You could sense the tension and it was terrific. Not to leave the rest of the cast out because they all did their fair share including strong performances from Alan Tudyk, Logan Lerman (was really terrific in his role as Bale's son), and Luce Rains. They all basically supported Bale and Crowe in their respective performances and they were all terrific.It really boils down to this. If you're a fan of Westerns than 310 To Yuma is really going to impress you because it has everything you could possibly ask for. And if you're not a fan of Westerns you won't like it because it's Western through and through. The story is terrific, the characters are great and it is a film that will likely stick around because I think it's got classic written on it. I have never seen the original 310 To Yuma although I'd like to and I don't know if it was good or not but this remake certainly brings it to a new generation because remake or on it's own it definitely gets it's point across for it's genre. Not life changing but a damn good western. 8.5/10",8,1,2,30 September 2007
The Equalizer," A dark nasty little action thriller that we don't get to see much of anymore
","The best thing for me about The Equalizer was that it felt, in some ways, like an old-school 80's/90's adult action thriller. Its one of those dark, gritty twisted films that bucks genre elements and says 'I'm gonna be violent and dark and if you don't like it don't watch it.' The Equalizer is brutally violent. I'm shocked they got this released without being severely watered down. It could be called an action/thriller/drama/horror hybrid and there are few films like that. Add in the fact that you have the extremely strong charisma of Denzel Washington and a complex and captivating character and you have one hell of a good time at the movies. Its Death Wish meets Batman meets Jason Bourne and how can you go wrong with that sort of mix? The film opens at a slower pace, carefully introducing our main character and giving him significant depth that you wouldn't normally get in your typical action film. By the time this movie is done you will be left breathless but you'll be asking yourself questions about our anti-hero Robert McCall for hours later. Who is he? What is his training? Where did he come from? What does all the subtle hints at his past add up to? The creation of this character is absolutely brilliant and if they serialize this...they could unravel him as they go.I have always liked Denzel Washington. He is a brilliant actor with an amazing career. However, I have also said before that he often exudes a certain egotism in his performances. That is toned down in this part but it is there a little bit but its also necessary. He is a man with insane unstoppable killing abilities trying to control them and dealing with a lot of his own dark demons. The character has significant OCD and it only serves to add to a host of questions. Is his condition in order to control his killing? Does it have to do with training? Is it PTSD? Washington IS this character and he is perfect in it. The brilliant young actress whom I adore Chloë Grace Moretz is good in a unfortunately small role as a wayward girl who Robert McCall takes a protective role with. When she is hurt and nearly killed, it inspires him to get back into action righting wrongs and crossing off thugs. Moretz is very good and this is a very adult role for her but it works. Her innocence and down to earth charisma makes you feel a lot of empathy for her character. We have a number of villains or 'Big Bads' in the film, each of varying degrees of mobster. David Harbour is very good as a crooked cop and a formidable foe to Washington for awhile at least, David Meunier is sold but short lived as a scumbag pimp but Marton Csokas absolutely steals the show as THEE main villain. He is a cold blood psychotic killer with skills not unlike Washington's and he is the sort of action hero villain you simply don't see anymore in films. He is terrific!! His final scene opposite Washington might go down as one of my favourite in action films. Johnny Skourtis is also really great as McCall's good friend and sort of partner (think Equalizer's Reginald VelJohnson of Die Hard...make sense?) He adds some humanity and down to earth qualities to Washington's character. Despite top billing Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo are barely there as cameos mid-way through the film.As expected Antoine Fuqua holds no punches. There are some downright nasty, blood splattering death scenes that had me cringing and really forcing myself to stare at the screen and not cover my eyes. He directs the action scenes to near perfection because while we get two or three full on violent hand to hand battles, many of the fight scenes are implied. We know McCall can kill, we know how he does it and we can imagine him doing it so we come in after he's already done it or jump over it as he's walking away. This way we don't get tired of seeing him in action and are inundated with his insane skills. This is a rare film because our hero is literally very nearly unstoppable. He is a killing machine and hardly gets a scratch on him. By the end of the film you figure he must be very close to the most deadly man alive and he has this deep emotional attachment to the human race that he wants to protect the innocent. When I first heard of this film my initial thought was that it wouldn't be the same as the TV Series(which it isn't at all) because it would be one single case he was dealing with. Fuqua cleverly handles this by giving him more than one instance where he helps the innocent. He handles like a good superhero origin story. The film is straight up excellent. I will watch it again, I was completely entertained, it is far from mainstream junk and it is one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a very long time. I feel as though the quality of future instalments would not be nearly as good (which may deter Washington from doing them at all) but I will be there if they do because I want to know more!! 8.5/10",8,1,8,6 October 2014
The Expendables 2," Sit down, strap in and get ready for two hours of incredible action.
","One thing is to be understood about The Expendables. Is it a perfect movie? NO. Does it have plot holes? YES. Do you have to shut your brain off nearly completely to let loose and have fun with it? ABSOLUTELY. But once you do that you will find yourself knee deep in the greatest homage to action fans ever. And you will also find the sort of action adult action entertainment that we haven't seen in years. This is the sort of R Rated fodder that made action movies quintessential in the eighties. Expendables 2 is probably even more of all that and is probably closer to the original idea Stallone had for this series. It is more of everything, better everything, non-stop blood guts and explosive action. The nods and outright fourth-wall breaking jokes are just fun and hilarious with direct mention of Rambo, Die Hard, Terminator, and Chuck Norris telling a Chuck Norris joke?!?! Pure awesome. Any red blooded male (or female) who loved action movies in the eighties and of the eighties will just scream with glee over this sequel. The first film laid the ground work and the second just nails it out of the park. That being said I think the first film had a stronger story, and strong actual character development and the sequel just went for pure nostalgia in a lot of ways.Sylvester Stallone steps out of the director's chair but stays lead in the cast. I can't help but love this guy and whether its special effects and stunt doubles or not he commands action movies even at almost 70. He looks great and kicks butt like it was 1985. The actual Expendables team sort of took a back seat in this film. They were there but not at the forefront. Jason Statham who is still a very current action star is great with Stallone. They have the perfect 'buddy-cop' type repertoire and good chemistry with each other. Statham's moment in this movie comes dressed as a priest before seriously cutting through a group of bad guys in hand to hand combat. Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture all take back seats in this outing. In fact Jet Li leaves the group in the first twenty minutes of the film and never comes back without any real explanation. Lundgren has a lot of MIT jokes in the film (a school he actually attended in real life) but he doesn't get quite as much screen time. Crews and Couture I can't stand anyways...I still don't understand why they're even in this series. Jean-Claude Van Damme is a evil as hell villain and a great adversary for Stallone. His only downfall is that he isn't given enough screen time to really establish a truly outstanding villain. Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger appear again in significantly bigger roles. The absolute highlight of the film is the shootout near the end featuring Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone. Seeing these three guys together, in full on action mode is just action hero nirvana. Schwarzenegger's Trench is a one lining killing machine and Willis is as suave and bad-ass as always. The one guy I thought who would ruin the movie was Liam Hemsworth as the new young kid of the group. I firmly eat my shirt because Hemsworth was fantastic and gave Stallone some heart and direction and he did a great job. Nan Yu is the new female addition to the team. She does a good job and they sort of weave in a potential romance with Stallone without forcing down your throat but she definitely holds her own. And finally B-Movie master Scott Adkins (I didn't even realize it was him) plays Van Damme's right hand man. He is okay and certainly cold blooded but he doesn't get a lot of time to establish a character. He gets even less than Steve Austin did in the first one playing the same role.Wow...what a list a main characters. So mix all of these people up, add in buckets of flying blood, debris, explosions, gunfire, hand to hand combat, knife battles, emotion a good story and you're just riveted to your chair for two hours. I mean this is the sort of nonsensical brain numbing action that you literally cannot get anymore period. And I mean that as the utmost compliment. Director Simon West isn't the type of director who has made dozens and dozens of movies but when I said action movies like Con Air and The Mechanic you know immediately these were first class action flicks. He knows how to tell a story and that indeed matters. Whether this sequel is 10 million behind the original or not...this improves on every single aspect of the first film. This is a rare breed of better sequel. Go see it right now and just let it blow you away. 9/10",9,2,5,31 August 2012
Source Code," Terrific sci-fi action flick that entertains throughout
","In watching the Trailers and reading about Source Code, this is a movie that fulfils every expectations you have of it. It doesn't try to be something it isn't and it is very entertaining simply enough. Sometimes a film can misrepresent itself in trailers but Source Code is exactly what it explains to be and unfolds at breakneck speed and will not disappoint for even a moment. Even the ending, where they could have stumbled ends perfectly for anyone. The lead performance in the film is a Hollywood star and he carries the film flawlessly. The film adds action intrigue and a whole of thrilling elements to the story which is certainly science fiction but a good solid action movie as well. The story is interesting and full of plenty of twists. It reminded me a lot of perhaps a Phillip Dick story in the same vein as Paycheck, or Minority Report although maybe a little more mainstream and subtle than perhaps those were in the genre. This film was made to entertain and it does and it might not be an amazing piece of film making artistically it does what movies are meant to do and that is entertain.I like Jake Gyllenhaal. He's the perfect Hollywood star. He has this intensity and he also has this 'guy next door' feel to him. He has done some really terrific roles and handles mainstream films like this easily because he is charismatic but his role in this film also requires some great intensity so as I mentioned he flawlessly and effortlessly carries this movie. Every time I see Michelle Monaghan in a film, I think the same thing. She's cute. She's always been decent in her roles but I've never seen anything she's done that really stands out and she is just cute. You want to pinch her cheeks and like Gyllenhaal she has a very 'next door' feel to her. Her and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry, it isn't mind blowing but it carries the film well enough. I do feel she could have been a little better in the role but she still does well. Vera Farmiga is good in a subtly intense role as the person directing Gyllenhaal to try and stop a disaster. She isn't right on the forefront but as a supporting character she is really good. Same could be said but on a small scale for supporting actors Jeffrey Wright, and Michael Arden who are good but don't really stand out in the film.Oddly enough the director of this film bucks my usual theory of directors with very few credits to their name tend to ruin a good story. Duncan Jones has very little big screen credits to his name but that doesn't stop him from making a captivating story. I think he's probably lucky to get really good actors and a solid story. Not that he isn't good from his own talent, in fact there are some really well put together scenes especially when Gyllenhaal is back in the future and inside the machine that transports him. Source Code is the perfect Saturday night flick to watch. It will entertain, and get you excited and give you a good solid story and anyone can enjoy it. It's the type of sci-fi flick that doesn't cater to just those fans. Source Code will be enjoyed by anyone. I definitely recommend! 8/10 ***Support your video stores!!

Skyfall," Solid entry in the Bond Franchise, Craig still continues to shine
","The immediate conversation of anything Bond will erupt in debate for fans. You can't have an iconic series for 50 years without causing some debate. Bond has formed itself into far more than thee action/spy franchise and instead is an epic film in and of itself. At an unapologetic 2 1/2 hours long, it does not feel it for an instant. There is as much story and drama as is there is action. Say what you will about Daniel Craig (he is the first Bond I ever saw, and since then I have watched Connery and Brosnan Bond films) and he brings a completely new Bond to the table and Skyfall showcases how different his Bond is. Craig's Bond is jaded, violent, brooding with a mysterious past. He has many vices including alcohol and women of course but Craig still manages to show the suave, womanizing, social side that has made Bond an icon for years. You can't expect every iteration of Bond to be the same or that would make for a very quickly dying series. Skyfall is epic, sweeping, all encompassing but still has good solid action scenes. I think the drama does drag in certain spots and the story isn't perfect but it is still entirely entertaining and worthy of any Bond fan.I think I've spoke enough about Craig but he is a great Bond. He has the chemistry, charisma, and acting chops to pull off this role. The only thing I always notice with Craig is that his ego tends to come through in his performances. Sometimes this works, sometimes it doesn't. For Bond, I think it works. Judi Dench returns to her iconic role as 'M' She was good, she plays her role well. Her character arc was a little weak, I sort of saw where it was going right from square one. They try and focus on her as a source of the story but she just doesn't really blow you away at it. Javier Bardem is getting all kinds of buzz and accolades as the flamboyant Bond villain. Certainly he does a great job and him and Craig have decent chemistry. He wasn't the most brilliant villain I've ever seen but he is still terrific in the role. Naomie Harris and Bérénice Marlohe are our Bond girls. They serve their purpose well enough, I think I would have liked to have seen more from Harris but she had a good role and the chemistry was good with Craig. An excellent supporting cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Ben Whishaw and Rory Kinnear in small but important roles. Also honourable nod to the amazing Albert Finney who had a great cameo role towards the end of the film. I also thought how great it would have been (although completely implausible and impossible) to have Sean Connery appear in Finney's role. But Finney was still terrific.I think that a truly great Bond film encompasses imagery, cinematography, women, gambling, gadgets, espionage and just a little bit of cheese. Director Sam Mendes nails every one of those things. He doesn't miss a single angle of who Bond is, even a new Bond like Craig. The film truly has an epic adventure feel and tells the story without burying it under mindless action. The action scenes are well shot and the film makers gave fans a truly outstanding nod to fan service in the form of a certain vehicle that everyone in the theatre seems to really enjoy. It wasn't a perfect film but it was still terrific. I think it was as good as any of the Craig Bond films up until now. It is certain to be financially successful and I truly hope this is not Craig's last go at the world's most iconic spy. 8/10",8,2,11,12 November 2012
The Hangover," One of the best road trip, buddy comedies in years. A hilarious romp!
","There are a few reasons why I would never slap more than an eight out of ten on this movie. First the obvious reasons...the trailer does indeed show, in the grand tradition of comedies, a HUGE portion of the funniest moments and basically covers the entire film. Fortunately the rest of the movie is so well written and really well performed that the scenes are still funny and everything in between the scenes are funnier. Secondly the film uses a tried and true formula and while there is nothing wrong with that it does mean that the film is a little bit predictable at times and the scenes that would have been truly funny and shocking they give away in the trailer. Regardless of these things The Hangover is a hilarious romp and you will go along with these crazy and very different guys and love every minute of it. The best part of the film is they will make you feel like you are one of the guys on the craziest night of their lives...and like them you have no idea what happened the night before making it all the more fun.Bradley Cooper headlines the cast as the alpha male and is absolutely perfect as the alpha male. He is strong and suave and cool, he's the popular guy that everybody wants to hang out with and Cooper carries the role flawlessly. He is more the straight man in this comedy but he is versatile enough that it really works and he holds the story and cast together. Ed Helms is just terrific as perfectly composed, level headed dentist Stu Price. The character unravels almost more than any other in the film and he just does a terrific job. Zach Galifianakis is probably the funniest member of this comedy troupe. He is brilliantly perfect as the quirky, awkward Alan. He easily becomes everyone's favorite and has some the funniest lines and subtly hilarious moments in the film. Justin Bartha plays the missing groom Doug. Bartha gets the least screen time out of the four guys but he is still a solid part of the team and is good in the role of Doug. The supporting cast is really terrific and quirky and lots of very funny moments come from the supporting cast including Heather Graham, Sasha Barrese, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong (absolutely hilarious role--a must see for him alone), Rachael Harris, and Mike Tyson (also hilarious.) These are the cameo roles that will really stand out and worth watching out for.The Hangover is practically guaranteed to become a cult classic...maybe even reach Animal House, Bachelor Party comedy status. It is also practically a guarantee that we will see another installment in The Hangover series and you know this from the moment Doug squeezes his wife's hand and whispers 'This will NEVER happen again,' that the crazy four guys are going to get in trouble all over again and millions will flock to watch. The four of them have amazing chemistry, the perfect combination and personalities and performances. Everything just fits together perfectly. Sometimes that's talent and sometimes its just luck. In this case it might be a little of everything. Certainly director Todd Phillips is no stranger to comedy having directed some really solid slapstick, raunchy comedies but with really good stories and that is the key. The Hangover is the must see adult comedy of the year. It will have you in stitches and I haven't heard a single bad word uttered about it so it seems like a general consensus, probably the comedy of the year thus far. 8/10",8,4,8,23 August 2009
Ghost," Forever a classic
","Certain movies will just always be hard to write a review for. You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists, it is incredibly, deeply, romantic and at the same time terrifying, and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action, mystery, horror, and at the heart is the pure, simplistic romance of it all.The story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend, played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love, planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out, Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.Swayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze, a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore, and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil. This film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes, it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments, a gratituous death scene, a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit, walk, etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have. The film is a must see and if you haven't seen it, go watch it right now!! Because it's one of those staples of films that everyone must know about. Ghost is amazing!! 9/10Happy Anniversary to my beautiful Sam...we watched Ghost together last night.",Null,99,126,15 November 2004
Iron Man 3," The Summer Blockbusters begin...here's the lowdown
","Before I go into the nitty gritty of Iron Man 3 let me just try and quell the angry fans that will jump all over me and say that it was a good movie!! It is a well deserving summer Blockbuster with brilliant special effects, a decent story, and a worthy sequel to not only the Iron Man franchise but also the Avengers as well. I enjoyed watching it. However...the big but...I completely understand where some of the fans who are ravaging it with bad reviews are coming from. I believe the incredible, first rate special effects, and the excellent performances warrant at least an 8 but the film has some major flaws too. First of all, this has now become less Iron Man and more The Robert Downey Jr. show. It has always struggled with that balance because Downey is so charismatic and a brilliant actor and to shove him in a metal suit and hide him seems pointless but...that is Iron Man. However, unfortunately the film has evolved into Iron Man suits that control themselves, Downey's Stark that is more James Bond out of the suit, a lot of gun fights like a spy flick and missed opportunities as a superhero movie. It felt like the whole schtick with the Iron Man suit was that none of his suits worked. If this were a drinking game you'd take a shot every time a suit malfunctions and you'd be drunk before the movie was over. He easily spends more time out of the suit than in it. I knew when I saw the trailer with the 'back-up' of a bunch of different 'Iron Man' robots that I wouldn't like that angle and I didn't. It was silly and pointless. Do I want to watch a dozen Batmans, Supermans, Iron Mans, Superhero clones? Nope. I came to see one! The other big flaw was that of The Mandarin. I will not give away the twist here because it is a substantial twist but the one thing I was perhaps most excited for from the trailers was the performance of Sir Ben Kingsley as The Mandarin. He appeared larger than life, viscous, an incredible superhero villain...well to say he was underwhelming is the understatement of the year. He was mis-used, horribly written and a complete and utter disappointment.The cast returns in full form. Robert Downey Jr. is electric as Stark. He is the perfect fulfilment of that cocky, dark, genius playboy. This time around he is dealing with some dark emotions following the events of The Avengers and its a good turn for his character. Replacing him when it comes time won't be easy as he is to Iron Man what Connery was to Bond. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, and Jon Favreau all return to their familiar roles. They are good but somehow all three of them are just a tad underused except Paltrow. She is as good as she has always been and her and Downey have good chemistry, boring great chemistry. I wasn't a fan of some of the plot twists to her character...felt like she wore a suit and donned more powers than Downey did in the movie. Cheadle is severely underused and spends most of his time out of his 'War Machine' suit too. I'm not sure why the makers of this third instalment thought Cheadle and Downey should stay out of their uniforms and act as their alter egos. I basically said all I can say about the legendary Ben Kingsley. I thought he was going to be one of the best villains to come out of a Superhero film and instead they ruined it. Its not his fault but rather the script because he could have been simply outstanding. Guy Pearce is decent as the villain who does things by channelling a Lex Luthor type character. He's a solid actor and does well but his character was only okay. Rebecca Hall also joins the cast as a Scientist from Stark's past. She is good as well though I'm not sure entirely necessary to the story.I definitely feel sorry for Shane Black as director. He had a HUGE OMINOUS job ahead of him. Disney and Marvel have built an action franchise worth countless Billions and every outing has to be EPIC and bigger and badder than each predecessor. Iron Man 3 certainly feels epic...there is no doubt. The very first action scene in Tony's home is brilliant and edge of your seat riveting. No matter what they are going to disappoint some fans because the expectations are so high. I still think no matter what they made a grievous error with the villains in the film which is such an important factor in a superhero film. Many fans are blaming Disney for such details as the kid sidekick that makes an appearance but that didn't bother me. There was a redemptive quality in the relationship between Stark and the kid. I was also surprised at the level of violence in the film especially considering how many innocent people are either blown up or just shot. Even bad guys are shot...a lot...just with a plain old gun. I could probably spend days nit picking my way through the film but I won't do that. It was a good movie, lots of fun, a great start to the summer Blockbusters and certainly it still holds its own in the superior Marvel franchise of movies. See it for yourself and try to go in with proper expectations. 8/10",8,0,1,24 May 2013
Marie Antoinette," Mind boggingly boring! No historical epic, no action, and not worthy of 5 minutes
","I love history, I love historical epics and I thought a new sharp update on the Marie Antoinette story would be terrific!! I couldn't have been more wrong. I'm blown away by the amount of people that could actually find anything even remotely interesting or entertaining about this movie but then I've been on the other side of that argument in various movies as well. To each their own but my own for this movie is that it was drop dead awful. I try to never turn a film off no matter how much I'm hating it and it was dreadfully brutal getting through this one and by the time it was half way through I was half watching it and half reading a book and I kept looking up from my book and thinking 'My God, is this still on?' The sheer fact that Sofia Coppola who directed and wrote this movie is Oscar nominated director and Oscar winning writer is sheer mind blowing. Although maybe it wasn't entirely her responsibility because there was simply one thing that made me not give this horrendous snooze fest a ZERO and that is the fact that its very, very pretty...but if this doesn't prove looks aren't everything than nothing does. The costumes are outstanding, enormous, larger than life and that is where it ends period.Now none of this blame will fall on its young star. Kirsten Dunst plays the lovely Marie Antoinette who comes from Austria to marry the French Dauphin. Dunst is very good, very spirited, cute, sexy even in some scenes and does carry the movie just fine considering it has no story, no action, no climax or anything else worthwhile. This was a disgrace to her talent. Jason Schwartzman barely has a pulse as the insatiably BORING Louis XVI. Rip Torn is a joke and barely noticeable as Louis XV and Judy Davis (an award worthy actress) is annoying and nagging as Dunst's mother. No one else is worth mentioning because everyone acts the same, there is different characters or stand out performances outside of Dunst's performance.When I originally saw trailers for this film I thought it was less historical or more of this hip retelling of the story complete with modern music which instead of being throughout the film is randomly thrown in there just to make things seem strange. They also would lead you to believe in the trailers that Antoinette is this wild child Queen who shakes everything up and she barely even shakes herself up. Everyone is simply dreadfully boring. Basically every idea you might have about this film from trailers is completely wrong. Other than the beautiful costume design and Dunst there is absolutely no reason to even look at this. You can see everything worth seeing in five minutes and save yourself the disaster of sitting through this. Dunst is sexualized in various costumes and situations to try and make it seem more interesting but it doesn't work. Oscar or no Oscar Coppola should be banned from movies for making this. 1/10",1,2,3,29 January 2008
The Ring," Mind Blowing!!!
","Of course different tastes will cause some people to feel differently about different films. I think The Ring is quite possibly one of the greatest films of all time, and needless to say my favorite or at the very least top three. Horror films, and I have seen hundreds, tend to lack extreme intelligence, they can be campy, crazy, senseless but still fun to watch. The Ring doesn't even fall into that category. Instead the American remake of the Japanese Ringu (also brilliantly made) is one of the most intelligent horrific and terrifying movies in existence. It doesn't just frighten, it gets under the skin and terrifies.The Ring is the story of a reporter named Rachel Keller, who's niece and three of her teenage friends quite suddenly die, their heart just stops. Rachel speaks to several people at her niece's funeral and discovers that many of them believe in an urban legend of a killer video tape that supposedly her niece and friends had watched. Rachel is determined to get to the bottom of the mysterious deaths and goes to the place where her niece supposedly saw this tape, an inn in the mountains. She finds the unmarked tape, and not believing the legend pops it in and is instantly caught in a downward spiral, no pun intended, of a mysterious, terrifying mystery. Suddenly a believer of the legend she calls her ex-boyfriend (possibly husband) and father of her son who is some sort of a video expert and shows it to him. He doesn't believe the stories at all until he gradually begins to realize he too is dying. They desperately piece together the clues from the killer video tape but not before their son, Aidan, accidentally gets hold of the tape and watches it as well. Now they're not only fighting for their lives but the life of their son. They uncover a horrible curse that started with an adopted daughter of a man and woman who were horse breeders. It seemed that the woman murdered her daughter after losing her mind. Despite the fact that they seemingly have figured out the mystery, they've got it all wrong and the evil won't go away.How incredibly easy it would be for a plot like this to do one of two things. 1. Become so incredibly confusing that it would be hard to follow and make no sense or 2. be completely cut and edited to shreds to 'dumb it down' for the movie going public. Somehow, brilliantly, Gore Verbinsky managed to do neither. The film fits together perfectly, and leaves so much open to discussion, imagination, or further stories of this deadly curse. The cast is all around brilliant. Naomi Watts, who until this film I would have figured not a good enough actress to pull off such an emotional role is so excellent as Rachel. She shows confidence, fear, and breakdown all at once. Her boyfriend played by Martin Henderson is equally as great in his role and their relationship is handled with dignity and charisma. And huge hats off to young David Dorfman who plays Watts' son Aidan. Dorfman's character is diverse and very strange. He seems to carry a connection with the evil Samara, and perhaps has some sort of abilities himself. He is much more grown up than he appears. Dorfman engulfs this role and is just startling and creepy and adds to the mood. He does a great job. So why is The Ring so great?? It's terrifying, that's why. This is done first and foremost by brilliant writing, the story itself is terrifying. But Verbinsky also created a very dull, Grey, rainy, dark setting that is constant and never breaks for comedy or 'lighten up.' The killer video itself sends shivers down your spine and you finish the movie wondering if your phone is gonna ring with a proclamation of 'SEVEN DAYS!' As in the original Japanese film, the time line is fast paced and you feel the anxiousness knowing they only have a short time to solve the mystery. The Ring is genuinely creepy and I don't suggest ever watching it alone. But I do suggest anyone a fan of remakes or horror or suspense, you MUST MUST own The Ring. I cannot wait another minute to see the follow up. There is so much more to this franchise!! HUGE 10 out of 10",10,0,1,25 March 2005
Raiders of the Lost Ark," An action classic that set the bar for adventure films--maybe too high?
","Did anyone know when they released Raiders of the Lost Ark that they were making history? I don't think they did. I'm told by my film making student brother that Spielberg and George Lucas made this with a certain amount of 'camp' in mind to pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 1940's which they pull off brilliantly. The budget on Raiders of The Lost Ark was eighteen million dollars, which was no paltry sum almost 30 years ago but it was far from being a big budget picture which went on to gross over 200 million dollars domestically. As brilliant as the film is for adventure I owe the success to ONE man and that IS Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford but more on that in a moment. I don't believe they knew they were making adventure genre history when they made this. First of all it wasn't Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark...he wasn't the focal point of the film. It was about the snakes and boulders and exotic locations, and wise cracks, and romance and just everything about it oozes 1940 classic cinema and people loved it. It is very unique and as a kid it blew me away and kept me riveted. I ALWAYS wanted to be Indiana Jones...ALWAYS. Watching it again years later I admit it didn't quite capture me in the same way but you can't dispute it's brilliance and effect on cinematic history.Harrison Ford was probably one of the biggest stars in the world. Coming out of Star Wars and Empire Strikes Back it only made sense for Lucas and Spielberg to bring him on this project and he created one of the world's most recognizable and kick ass heroes that he will forever be known for. Ford is hilarious, and smart, and brilliant, and fast and an action hero like none other. His Indiana Jones is probably one of my favorite film characters of all time. He made this film and took an adventure film and made it a whole new genre...the Indiana Jones film. That sly smile and almost clumsy but always suave way makes him amazing. One thing that always rubbed me wrong about the Indiana Jones films was I am never a fan of his women and Karen Allen is really no exception. Her performance is okay but she just doesn't mesh well with Ford and she has to. Her sarcastic, feisty character just annoys more than anything. You don't believe a romance between them and you don't really want her saved. Paul Freeman is devilish and wicked as the villain of the film trying everything he can to kill Jones and make off with the ark for Hitler himself. His end in the film is one of the most memorable and gruesome in my mind. The brilliant and versatile supporting cast all play to one end and that is to lift up the character of Dr. Indiana Jones and that is perfect because Ford could carry this film or any other all the way through. John Rhys-Davies (an amazing character actor and does terrific as the sidekick), and Denholm Elliott, who I always loved as Jones' faithful friend in all three films.Spielberg is the master of directing...he IS directing and Raiders of the Lost Ark is an example of what he can do with a story and a great character. I mean this film created historical cinematic moments that will be remembered for ever. Indiana Jones, his whip, the boulder chasing him, switching the statue for the bag of sand, snakes...he hates snakes...everything about this film is classic. As an adult you might find it a little campy, almost a mocking tone to it but I don't think that's the intention. I think it was simply meant to represent a different time and genre and it succeeds in a big way. A film that everyone MUST MUST MUST see even if it isn't a HUGE 10/10 for me...I do give it all it's honor for being what it is. 8.5/10",8,0,1,23 February 2008
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Resident Evil continues once again to bring mind blowing action and Zombie to the very top of the pile
","I guess, although I don't think of it often, the entire Resident Evil Series must be considered one of my favourite series of films of all time. I haven't scored one of them less than a 9 and this is no exception. Its even more mind blowing to think this is based off of a video game series that long before this film series I thought could make a great movie series but no one would ever do it properly but that just isn't so. The entire series packs science fiction, horror, action, thriller into one perfect conglomeration. The story carries throughout and they tie all the ends together while still creating a solid individual story for this film. Resident Evil Afterlife isn't pure artistic brilliance (shocker I know) but it is cold hard entertainment and sometimes that is the best film you can walk into. Milla Jovovich reprises her role as one of the best action heroes to ever grace the screen. Alice has gone through so many different evolutions (no pun intended) since the very first film and she continues to prove she is the hero of the story. Jovoich has had good roles and bad but she certainly sinks her teeth into a story and really tries to make it come to life. No one could replace her in this series. Ali Larter also returns to her role as video game hero Claire Redfield. Similar to her previous performance in Extinction she does well but seems to slip into the background when compared to Jovovich. Where Jovovich gets to really kick butt Larter is more the sex symbol although she has an incredible battle against the Axeman. Shawn Roberts takes over as Albert Wesker and does an awesome job. While the character might seem a little campy at times he still makes for a true kick butt villain that must come back!! Roberts looks the part and it would be great to see him come back. Newcomer to the cast is Wentworth Miller, someone I have come to know and love through Prison Break and had a lot of expectations for him. The unfortunate part is I think he could have done a lot better. I don't think they gave Chris Redfield a lot of depth or purpose in this film which is unfortunate because I think the character and Miller could really knock it out of the park. Kim Coates, Sergio Peris-Mencheta, Spencer Locke, Boris Kodjoe, Kacey Barnfield, and Norman Yeung make up the supporting cast that are okay in their roles but mostly fodder necessary for the gore and action.Say what you will about director, writer and producer Paul Anderson but he really does care about entertaining. Some professional reviewers say he has too many ideas and doesn't know how to make them happen and I can see where they get that but the simple fact is Afterlife and the previous Resident Evil films are simply entertaining beginning to end making it the best action, the best horror, and the best science fiction film series in years. There are a few key elements to Afterlife. First of all this is probably most likely the film that is most based on the video game series, or at least has the most references...Wesker, Redfields, Jill, the dogs, the Executioner (or the Axeman as he is known), and even the twist at the end...I'm probably leaving something out but there is plenty for game fans (especially of Resident Evil 5) to notice. The second thing is of course the 3D. I am simply not a fan of this latest insane craze of 3D films. I think its cheesy and takes away from losing yourself in a film. That being said the 3D in Afterlife was done very well and while I don't think it adds anything whatsoever to the film...its fun to watch. Do yourself a favour right now and see the first three films and then rush out to see Afterlife because if you love any of the genre of films I mentioned you will be blown away by Afterlife beginning to end. I said in the very first review that if they could do as well as the first one I would come back as many times to as many sequels as they could make...now a fifth instalment is one of my most anticipated films of all time. 9/10",9,15,33,15 September 2010
Stop-Loss," Another anti-Iraq war movie but this one shows a different side
","Stop Loss is unique. Almost surprisingly given the content of the film. We have had a plethora of anti-Iraq films the most recent of course being The Hurt Locker which gained critical acclaim including Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So how is this film different? First of all I believe that Stop Loss was made with the intent of appealing to a young demographic. I think they are trying to show young impressionable people how this affects people who are in their own age demo, and also what it is like for these soldiers. They due this by bringing in a cast of well known hot young up and comers, a simplistic story, and a strong lead character. The film is more entertaining than educational but does both easily. There is nothing wrong with any of this and its also refreshing to have a film about the current war from the perspective of stateside and a soldier wrestling with emotions and guilt to return to the war. The film has very little scenes of the actual war and instead is really showing us the soldiers who are affected afterword and their lives as they try to piece it together. It is certainly well worth seeing but unfortunately isn't as intense or effective as it tries to be.Ryan Phillippe headlines the cast as a brave solider tormented with visions of the things they've done. Phillippe is good, he's as good as he always is and that is good but never truly great. He shows a lot of emotion and holds the film well and fits the bill for the aforementioned attempt at bringing in a younger demographic. Another young up and coming star is Channing Tatum who gets some really meaty emotions as he displays PTSD. Tatum gets the most as far as emotions but really doesn't get a lot of depth beyond that to his character. I'm quite convinced having seen him in a few things as of late that Joseph Gordon-Levitt is just a skip away from an Academy Award nomination. I don't mean to say his performance in this film is necessarily worthy of that but he always does an incredible job and really grabs on to a character. As Tommy Burgess he's an alcoholic, torn apart by memories of the war, and losing his wife. Lovely actor Abbie Cornish plays Tatum's wife, Michelle. She also does a good job of playing the girl next door, nice southern belle wife and has good chemistry with Phillippe. She never gets much character development however despite her involvement in the story.Heavily acclaimed director Kimberly Peirce who gained awards and notoriety for the 'just okay' film (in my opinion) Boys Don't Cry is still very new to directing. I think she is the type of director who gets her hands on a cause and wants to show it off using her talents. She also co-wrote the film with Mark Richard and neither of them really have a lot of big screen credits to their name. I only point this out because Stop Loss in the hands of a more experienced director and writer could have really been something to take notice of. Unfortunately whether you chalk it up to inexperience with the film makers or an attempt at mainstreaming a serious message the film is good but never great and unfortunately will most likely be forgotten in a sea of Iraq based war films. I honestly didn't feel that something so acclaimed like The Hurt Locker was that far ahead of Stop Loss but opinions only mean so much. 7.5/10",7,1,1,21 March 2010
United 93," Nicely made, tastefully done, a tribute to heroes!!
","I feel that before I go ahead and review this film I have to make a small statement. September 11th, 2001, devastated the world, especially of course those families who lost their loved ones in the tragedy. There has been a lot of controversy around Hollywood seemingly trivializing the events but it has to be expected that films would be made about. World wars, Serial killers, bombings, and worse have all been subject to film making and if done right simply recognizes the events and helps us remember. I have no beef with films being made about 9/11 and I review this film with the utmost respect, and caring for families and victims of 9/11 and those hijacked planes. My less than perfect score does not in any way represent how I feel about the situation or the people but rather film making style, and how I felt about the movie. If I offend anyone I am deeply sorry.United 93 is made in an extremely unique and different way. The cast is the exact definition of an 'ensemble' because no one person gets a 'lead role' or to be the defining character. Instead this is a very real dramatization, in real time of the events on 9/11 eventually leading up to the ill fated flight United 93 who's passengers took control of the aircraft in an effort to stop the terrorists from hitting any other targets. It is believed that they very possibly saved a Washington Target, perhaps even the White House. The film unfolds at a fairly significant speed and each event hits home like a rocket. Watching those planes hit those towers absolutely transports you back to that day and makes you sick to your stomach. We get to see perspectives from the Air Traffic Controllers, and of course the crew, passengers and even the terrorists of United 93.Paul Greengrass who wrote and directed the film did a stellar job. I think it made people nervous that Greengrass also directed the intense action sequel Bourne Supremacy and he could have made a real big budget Hollywood mess out of a very emotional subject but instead he made it so downright real it was barely a film. It's near impossible to say any one thing about any one actor in the film, they all do such an incredible job of just being real, scared, hurt, angry people. Greengrass even remarkably gave us a small peek into the terrorists who were also scared, determined. angry, and even having second thoughts at certain times. That's pretty incredible to be able to bring some of the worst real life villains in history and humanize them almost to the point of feeling sympathy for their religious fanaticism. The film doesn't try to be what it's not and never tries to add anything for dramatic effect. It's probably one of the most accurate film portrayals in history.In some ways that becomes this films short coming. It has no 'plot line' per se, no characters that you can really get involved with, it's not your average movie going experience. It's almost documentary like without actual information being provided. It drags a little in the middle and the ending is very abrupt but at the same time completely appropriate. It's almost impossible to judge a movie of this caliber because it's not meant to be entertainment per se but truly a tribute to those heroes who possibly saved countless lives. The film is absolutely worth seeing for the reason alone that it's probably one of the most uniquely done films ever. And on top of that it's a touching and well done tribute to those men and women. 8/10",8,1,3,25 May 2006
Deja Vu," Interesting and original, far more sci-fi than it presents itself
","Deja Vu is more than a little misrepresented in it's trailer. I mean it is an action film by Tony Scott, it does star a host of big stars including Denzel Washington but the plot and idea is far more science fiction than it ever presents. From watching the trailers I had no idea that Deja Vu revolved around time travel. That being said Deja Vu happens to be one of the best action films of the season with an original, well connected plot, easy to follow but complex and intelligent story line and some strong performances with some small flaws to them. Tony Scott and Denzel Washington had something in common to me...I did not like either of their last films...Domino or The Inside Man so I wasn't sure if the two of them together were my mix but the strong, brilliantly written storyline drew me in. Scott filmed and captured New Orleans like few directors good and uses that setting to really make a difference in the picture and not just use New Orleans 'because.' Denzel Washington leads the cast as almost too brilliant ATF agent Doug Carlin. Now Washington is a brilliant actor, I have seen him in some brilliant roles but his ego has pretty much seeped into every performance he has and drags down his characters and makes them often unlikeable. Carlin can spot a clue from the ground on the bottom of a bridge in the air. He's just REALLY good at his job which is fine but Washington gives a distinct air of conceit which makes him annoying. But he still commands a certain screen presence so it works. Val Kilmer plays a supporting role, and a good one, as Agent Andrew Pryzwarra who puts together a team of his choice to investigate a brutal terrorist bombing that kills many Marines and their families on a ferry. Kilmer is great and the conceit he once carried with his characters is gone and has been gone since Batman Forever making him a decent strong actor in what he does. I would have liked to have seen more of his character in this film. James Caviezel is dark and brilliant, and downright evil as Washington's nemesis and the terrorist bomber Carroll Oerstadt. Paula Patton is also fairly good as the victim of the bomber who just needs her out of the way.Small clues are dropped randomly right from square one in the film that won't be connected or make sense until the very end of the film. Time Travel doesn't truly happen until almost 3/4 of the way through the film but still the story is being set for the future plot. Time Travel films can be very difficult making sure things match up and dealing with time paradoxes and the likes but Deja Vu does a very good job keeping tabs on the details. Throw in a few very thrilling car chases and an even more thrilling murder mystery and it makes for one of those must see movies that come out every once in awhile. Deja Vu is a strong action, intense thriller and well worth your theater money, or rental when times comes. 9/10",9,2,4,25 December 2006
Casablanca," 600 Reviews and now I am tackling what many consider the greatest film ever made
","I have never seen Casablanca until today. I had planned for some time that this would be my 600th review and I think it's very fitting. Is Casablanca truly the magnificent piece of cinematic history or does it simply have something that many classics are fortunate to have...cine-magic as I will call it. Some films just have this style, this charisma, the perfect balance of the something special that makes them endearing to millions and I think Casablanca is the perfect example of this. Furthermore Casablanca is often known as one of the 'greatest romance films of all time' but despite the romantic undertone the film is more of a World War II drama about patriotism and escaping the Nazi grip on the area. For its time, and the film certainly is timeless, but the gritty, dark setting sets a tone for danger and intrigue and mystery and even that romance. The characters are so sleek and have so much depth and you are just immediately enthralled with this story and this beautiful Casablanca world. The true brilliance of watching Casablanca now is feeling the classic aura. This film has SO many lines that are now truly pop culture history and so many moments that you will immediately recognize even if you've never seen it before.This is my first Humphrey Bogart film and 'Bogie' is one incredible guy. He brings a whole new meaning to macho. Rick Blaine (Mr. Rick) is definitely a cinematic character you won't ever forget. He's rough and rugged and smart and has a deep history that unravels through the film and Bogart is terrific. He embodies the character and brings it right to the forefront of the film. From his drunken stupor as he cries for his lost love, to the final moments of saving lives he is amazing. Ingrid Bergman is beautiful yet her character is very subtle. She plays the mysterious and illusive Ilsa Lund. I can't say her performance is on par with Bogart's because her character is much more withdrawn and less bold but her magic performance comes from the fact that her and Bogart have incredible, unmistakable chemistry the likes of which you never see on screen anymore. For this reason no one else could replace her. Paul Henreid is also very good as the tough but decent Victor Laszlo. Henreid holds his own opposite Bogart, which is an impressive feat, and still creates a very impulsive and interesting character. Claude Rains also deserves mention as the menacing and self involved Nazi, Captain Renault.Casablanca is the perfect example of the all the right ingredients lining up to create something completely magical. It would be hard to not have a brilliantly directed film like Casablanca with a director like Michael Curtiz who has no less than an astounding 170 plus films to his credit. Casablanca might be one of his most famous credits but for good reason. Casablanca isn't a perfect film...hence my lack of a 10/10 on it...or even a 9/10. I think some movie goers especially nowadays might find Casablanca slow paced, maybe even with some less than stellar dialog and it does reek of it's anti Nazi moral (not that there is a problem with that) but it definitely has that tone. The terrific romance that is always talked about is slowly unraveled and never really hits a climax but is more about romance in the past and love lost. Its actually more of a tragic romance and in that respect might turn romance fans off. Still the romance that once blossomed between Bogart and Bergman is still fiery and the story is sweet AND tragic. Regardless of how you look at it Casablanca stands the test of time and is something everyone must see at least once and I am glad to have seen it and will most definitely see it again. If nothing else you must watch the final scene on the air strip which is packed full of more classic lines and moments than any other part. Simply brilliant. 8.5/10",8,2,4,2 January 2008
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Perhaps one of the most stylish films ever made, lacking some depth
","I really wanted to see Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter in theaters but I missed it so I was really looking forward to seeing it on DVD. I'm certainly glad I got to see it but I wish even more I had seen it on the big screen. The film is visually spectacular, brilliantly visual, just stunning and well done special effects and a unique flare that you will not forget. That being said...dazzling visuals and style does not make a great movie. The story leaves a lot wide open that you feel is sort of empty filler. I'm not sure they really delved into the idea that THEE famous President Lincoln was a vampire hunter. Sometimes it felt like this guy could be anyone rather than a famous historical figure. There was so much content to this movie that I think it was almost too ambitious to cram into one film. The idea of sequels doesn't work because we all know how Lincoln's life ends so they do try to work everything they can into it. Still despite a slightly less than impressive story the film stuns you with its fight scenes, gadgets and death scenes. A dizzying array of gritty, Gothic and gory fun.Benjamin Walker carries this film very well. I think you'll see him pop up as the lead in many more films like this one. His on screen charisma is decent and he pulls off the role with ease. I was slightly under-impressed by the makeup job that they did for him when he was older Abe Lincoln but that isn't his fault. I just thought for how visually stunning the film was, the makeup was poor on him. Dominic Cooper plays a good role that I think is a little underused in the film. Still he is a good mentor for Lincoln and has a good mysterious past that is used well. Rufus Sewell makes a good solid villain. Now an amazing villain, but not for lack of his performance. The main villain I think is underwritten but Sewell does his very best with what he is given. Supporting cast, especially Anthony Mackie, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Jimmi Simpson do a good job in their perspective roles. There are no issues at all with anyone's performance, everyone does a great job. The issue is that the characters are not written with enough depth. Everyone is so good and the characters seem so interesting that its disappointing to see them underused.Perhaps this would have made a better big budget TV Series so they could really explore the characters. I don't think they could have gotten a better director though in Timur Bekmambetov. His vision is literally breathtaking and he takes a 6/10 script and turns it into an 8/10 movie. Its well worth seeing and a great comic adaptation visually but the story will leave you wondering what more there could have been. Still a good solid action flick. 8/10",8,2,4,21 October 2012
Finding Neverland," A breath of imagination...and fresh air...
","With no prior knowledge other than speculation of Oscar nominations did I watch Finding Neverland. It's the films that surprise you that are the true classics and gems and this one will forever be one for me.Finding Neverland is the story of Peter Pan creator James Barrie. A brilliant playwright, an imaginative, playful man who is surrounded by the adult world and feels rather held back until he meets a widow with four very interesting young children. One of the middle children Peter is quite devastated by the death of his father and lashes out against the world of children. Barrie introduces laughter and fun and above all else amazing imagination into the Children's lives and their mother. Despite all others around him trying to repress his imaginative spirit he uses the children as inspiration to create the amazing world of Peter Pan.Johnny Depp who I am an enormous fan of is brilliant as Barrie. He encompasses the character perfectly and shows us a man who just wants to have fun and show others how to imagine and have fun as well. Kate Winslet, who I have always saw as an extreme over actor is actually very good, her best role in fact as the mother and widow of the children. Depp and Winslet's character share a deep friendship, and an understanding and love but are never romantic together. Depp's character is married and although unhappy he works to try and make his wife understand him. Dustin Hoffman who also is one of my all time favorite actors, (Captain Hook himself) makes a cameo appearance as Barrie's financier for his plays. He doesn't really have faith in this carefree spirited Peter Pan play but he allows Barrie to have his way and the rest is history.The film is moving, and interesting, and captivating. The characters are brilliant and the story is just amazing. The cast is perfect and everyone does an amazing job. It truly is a wonderful story. But in addition to all that the film is also very unique and pushes your imagination to the limit with beautiful imaginary scenery and bazaar moments when everything changes around them as they create their Neverland. You must see this film, it's one of the best I have seen in a very long time. I do believe this film will always be one of my favorites and I can't think of a thing wrong with it and therefore must give it a hearty 10/10. I loved it.",Null,2,2,22 December 2004
If I Stay," Surprisingly dreary and slow, saved only by a very good cast
","Really my header says it all. I expected this to be a lovely, heart wrenching drama/romance filled with teen angst and a ridiculously syrupy sweet story and honestly? It hardly was any of that. The story seemed to drag excruciatingly so and it jumps back and forth in a way that never really works. I actually thought 3/4 of the way through the movie that they were doing something clever, playing a trick on you where the flash backs were actually flash forwards and I was getting excited that something unique and clever would come out of this...and then...nothing. Dreary. Almost boring. How unfortunate! I haven't yet seen The Fault In My Stars but I'm hoping it is far better than this. I am glad to say that the cast for the most part saves this from being a complete awful mess. The cast is actually very good and I would even say that much of the dialogue and script is pretty good too. Its the plot and the pacing where the film truly stumbles. The chemistry with our lead 'Romeo and Juliette' if you will is okay at best and with a romance full of passion and angst you want incredible chemistry. Any of the romantic classics the chemistry is phenomenal.I adore Chloe Grace Moretz. I think she is one of the best young talents in Hollywood period. Since the moment I saw her in Let Me In I knew she was a talent to be reckoned with. Her charisma on screen shines through here and her role is very good (though a little predictable) but she does well in it. This is definitely a starring vehicle for her and the slow pace doesn't take away from her performance which is very good. Jamie Blackley is her Romeo. He's decent. He plays the role well. The role is also painstakingly predictable. He's a young rocker with a hint of goth to him and he's created with the sole purpose to make teen girls swoon and I suppose he does that well. The chemistry between them is decent which helps. Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard are fantastic as the free spirited parents of Moretz's Mia. Enos and Leonard have a lot of great lines in the film, very memorable life moments and they are fun together and as individual characters. Stacy Keach might give the best performance in the whole film. He is one to watch because he is quite honestly stunning. His scene beside Mia and his desperate speech to her is heart wrenching. Liana Liberato as Moretz's best friend is okay but very underused and just sort of there.So the cast ranges from good to great...so why does the movie fail? Simple. It is painfully predictable, horribly mis-paced, and very scattered in its story telling. I think this lays solely on the shoulders of our director and perhaps writers too. RJ Cutler has absolutely no experience in this genre and it has such a direct demographic that it is aimed at. Cutler is a pro at documentaries and at some Television but how would he get this job? Even screenwriter Shauna Cross who has done some good work is not right for this film. I often wonder what studios are thinking when they give scripts like this to people who don't have the right area of expertise. Its an average film aimed at young teen girls with too much sex to really appeal to that age group and not enough direction to make it worthwhile. Skip this one and wait for another romance with more oomph behind it. 6/10 (most of this rating if not all is for the cast.)",6,1,3,4 September 2014
Friday Night Lights," For football fans mostly
","Football films frighten me. I despised Any Given Sunday, and was bored to tears by Remember The Titans. I don't like football and never have. Despite some emotional performances and some great action sports scenes I found Friday Night Lights not much different.The film is based on the true story of small town Odessa Texas who's passion lies in their football team The Permian High Panthers. The boys of the Panthers seem to have no other future other than Football, they live and breath it and they need to be successful in order to get out of the poverty stricken town. Coach Gary Gaines is determined to take his team to the State Championship by inspiring his team. He works hard at bringing his team together after the loss of their star player Boobie Miles. The film doesn't rely a lot on plot both rather just shows us a season in the lives of this team from this fanatical town.If High School football was ever actually this fanatic, that's scary and sad. Everyone is over the top crazy insane about this team and football. There is some subplots very minor with different members of the team and just when you get into it, they cut back to the guys playing football. Peter Berg does a decent job directing the action and creates some really tense and brutal scenes with the actual plays but unless you're a football fan I really think this movie will bore you. I won't call it a bad movie because I don't like football. I thought it was just okay. 6/10",6,0,0,1 June 2005
John Wick," Throw back action that was a ton of fun
","I went into John Wick nearly completely blind. I am certain I did not see a single trailer for it. I knew it had Keanu Reeves and I knew it was about a man out for vengeance when his dog is killed. It sounded almost silly but I expected there would be more to it and there was. Actually there is a whole lot of back story here and a million different directions this could go in if they chose to franchise it. Its a dark, twisted, violent, martial arts, action film that was often brilliantly choreographed and reminded me of perhaps a Luc Besson film or John Woo (only good...I'm not a Woo fan.) Its not quite an 80's action throwback but more of a 90's action throwback. Fans of The Matrix will rejoice in this return to that style of film for Reeves. The story is actually very good and you very quickly begin to understand just how dangerous John Wick is. Essentially you start the film knowing nothing about him but you quickly understand a little about his past and the world he ran in and how dangerous he is. One of the best things about John Wick is the world the film makers bother to create behind the story going on. You have a mysterious underground organization of hit men and women, a club that is a 'safe zone' and a network of killers that rub elbows together. All of that collides into this blood bath and its insanely fun to watch.I can't honestly say I've see Keanu Reeves in anything I was impressed with since Constantine. I feel like he often forgets what people love to see him in and that has always been action. This returns him to full form and he doesn't miss a beat. I don't know how much of his own stunts and fighting he does but he kicks some serious a$$ and looks great doing it. I would watch this film a second time just to catch some of the more intense moments. Alfie Allen is fantastic as the whiny privileged son of a mobster who crosses John Wick. You actually ache to watch Allen get destroyed and he's perfectly irritating in all the right ways. In order to make sure the story has a proper villain we have Michael Nyqvist as his father. He definitely has an air of villainy to him and he's the perfect adversary to Wick. You can just feel the history between the two characters. Willem Dafoe is fantastic in a small role as a fellow assassin. We know that he and Reeves also have history and we don't know what and we never really find out but we know there is a relationship there. Dean Winters is the perfect number one henchman and his role is perfectly used and placed, Adrianne Palicki is actually amazing as a seriously deranged female assassin (she could stand to have a whole movie on her alone), and honourable mentions to Ian McShane, Lance Reddick, and John Leguizamo in cameo roles that are really terrific. No matter how big or small a role in this film is, I thought they did a great job at establishing this world John Wick exists in and the circles he once ran in and with. I want more!! That is the best compliment I can give.Now this is director Chad Stahelski's first directorial credit. This usually means a film reeks of inexperience. However, if you look at the sheer number of films that Stahelski has worked on in stunts and assistant directing and producing, you will see that he has been building an incredible resume of experience and John Wick proves that. He has a style that is near perfect this revenge type of martial arts film. I cringed, I nearly cried, I cheered, I veered, I didn't want it to end. Its not a critically brilliant film but its nearly perfectly entertaining. The story is a little predictable in the idea that a hit-man leaves the business because he falls in love only to be drawn back in when something terrible happens. That's not a new concept although his anger being triggered by the death of a puppy is a new angle. Action fans take note because if you haven't seen John Wick you are missing out!! This is a return to greatness for Reeves and I could easily watch this again and may even add it to my collection. It holds nothing back and lives up to its 'R' Rated which is also unusual nowadays. Because of this film I anxiously await to see what Stahelski does next. 8.5/10",8,11,27,17 November 2014
Rocketman," A synopsis musical fantasy biography
","I can see how some won't take to Rocketman well even if they are fans of Sir Elton John. It doesn't really follow the typical biographical film path. It's part fantasy, part bio-pic and really just small snippets of Elton John's life. It has his music dabbed throughout it and captures what I presume he feels are the major points in his life. It does a good job of capturing many of his relationships and inspirations too and gets the point across of some of his major trials and tribulations. Taren Egerton is brilliant. He gives an Oscar nominated worthy performance as Elton John. He completely embodies the role and disappears into it and some of the shots and profiles of him look eerily like a young Elton. And then on top of that to do his own singing it just fantastic. Jamie Bell is good as his life long writing partner Bernie. They have a definite chemistry on screen and the role is underplayed in a lot of ways but still emphasizes the importance of their brotherhood. His sexuality is handled blatantly but well including his relationships on that front as well. A brilliant lead performance, performances of iconic music, a flashy musical, it's a lot of fun and it's unique and definitely unlike anything else out there right now so well worth checking out but understand this is going for something a little more fantastical than just a biopic like Bohemian Rhapsody was. 8/10",8,1,1,2 June 2019
Gravity," Can't jump on the Gravity bandwagon for this one
","From the first trailer for the film I thought it looked intriguing, though the trailers never provided much information. You could guess at the concept and most guesses would be accurate. Its a survival/disaster story set in space with astronauts and no hint of science fiction whatsoever. I was a little surprised that suddenly the film exploded with huge ratings and huge box office returns. So because of that my expectations were high and I was prepared to potentially see a 10/10 film. I didn't hate this movie...do not get me wrong. It was entertaining and had some really nail biting moments. Visually it was good. But couldn't anyone make a visually stunning film with the backdrop of space looking down on earth. My biggest issue with the film is how unrealistic it felt. I am not a scientist and I know nothing about space travel but do I need to in order to know that NASA would not be sending up someone who is emotionally and physically unprepared and watching Bullock's character is sometimes laughable and that is unfortunate. I know I'm not the only one because other reviewers on IMDb have pointed out the exact things that bothered me. She makes poor decisions, completely unrealistic moves and generally is unbelievable in the role.I don't blame Sandra Bullock as an actress because she is a great actress. In fact what I say doesn't matter because this film is raking in money and likely to get Oscar nominations (a travesty and a joke in my opinion.) Bullock's character is empty and depressing. The addition of her talking about losing her daughter is pointless and forced on you to try and get an emotional reaction and it doesn't work at all. She shows her emotions well when she is in danger but the character is weakly written and you never truly get attached to her in any way. George Clooney is mostly there as another star-power name. He does alright but once again his character does not fit the film. His sarcasm, and humour stands out and is ridiculous at times. The chemistry between him and Bullock could be great but the script does nothing to give them that opportunity. Neither one are riveting and worst of all neither of them are even remotely believable as astronauts. Clooney is supposed to be the seasoned veteran and he's training Bullock out in space...I am almost certain that she would never even remotely leave earth without being 1000% trained. As other reviewers pointed out...Bullock consults training manuals in various languages and then resorts to playing eenie meenie miney moe on a spacecraft trying to get it to fly. Are you serious? How can anyone stomach that and accept it.Alfonso Cuarón has apparently built a very solid fan base. Children of Men was almost brilliant and Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix was phenomenal. However, I feel like he is one of those film makers that lets stories slide in order to impress us visually or artistically. Children of Men and Gravity are shining examples of this. Cuarón turns Gravity completely bizarre by forcing in absolutely ridiculous art-house scenes (Bullock's ridiculous fetal floating scene, and the end scene of her standing and being shot as though she is about to scream 'I AM WOMAN.') What is he trying to do with this? Its irritating because this could have been a terrific disaster, survival flick and he tried to do more with it than it deserved. One of the things I loved about the film was the lack of sound in space. While it certainly reduces the impact of the shattering space stations it is more realistic and really disturbing to see all that debris and destruction but to hear nothing. As many of you who read my reviews may know, I am NOT a 3D fan. It doesn't bother me but it does nothing to increase the value of a film. I thought Gravity might be the exception to that and it wasn't. There was nothing in this film made more impressive by 3D and that's just a real shame. It sounds like I've really trashed on this movie and I have but I was just so blown away by how much everyone loves this movie and how it mostly let me down. It wasn't terrible and it was reasonably entertaining but I would never go out of my way to watch it again. It was a sub-par and rushed project that Cuarón unapologetically ignores a tight script or research. You will watch this regardless and chances are you will love it because its the mass opinion right now but I have to say how I feel and this one for me was a pass. 6/10",6,16,30,12 October 2013
Lone Survivor," A solid and moving story turned into a mainstream action film
","Lone Survivor was one of those films that I didn't particularly desire to see but it was playing at the right time for me to see a film so in I went. It was basically what I anticipated it to be and that isn't a bad thing at all. Lone Survivor is a riveting, dramatic, well acted and often hard to watch story based on the impossible survival of a US Armed Forces soldier. I think under the proper direction and script this could have been as big and as accepted as Zero Dark Thirty (an already completely inferior film in my books) What I mean to say is that this powerful story could have been less mainstreamed to be more critically accepted and more focused on the powerful emotion behind it. Instead they chose to aim for the general public as its demographic and that's okay because it is very entertaining but how much of it was accurate? Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. Perhaps I should read the book but I kept questioning whether these four men were truly shot multiple times, time after time like they were bulletproof and kept going...including one of them being shot in the head and still upright and talking. All of this is indeed possible but I want to know whether it was realistic to THIS situation. After a little bit of a slow start, the film really starts rolling and will leave you breathless. It has easily one of the best and horrifying scenes of someone falling down a mountainside. It literally felt painful to watch it.I am really becoming a big fan of Mark Wahlberg. I think he's a very talented star, one of the best in Hollywood right now, and he does action very, very well. This is no exception. I thought maybe being that he was such a big star that he might not fit into this cast but he does...flawlessly. He brings a raw emotion and power to the role and he doesn't start as the key player but by the end he is the clear cut star. The first part of the film struggles to really get you familiar with the main crew. They drop obvious breadcrumbs like one of them is buying a horse for his woman, the other is dating or married to an Asian woman...things like that. It isn't until half way through the film where you really start to understand and connect to these characters. Taylor Kitsch was my least favourite on the team. No offence to him but his character felt like it was overly dramatic. His death scene felt ridiculous under the circumstances of a movie. The slow motion falling, the heroic pose on his knees on a mountainside with the sun rising over the beautiful landscape...it was hokey. It was like they were trying to spoof an action hero using Kitsch and his performance suffers because of it. Emile Hirsch on the other hand was excellent. He was charismatic, interesting, and made his character stand out and feel believable. Ben Foster...man I love this kid...and I always forget about him because he'll do a big movie and then vanish for a long while. While here he is again in the best role in the movie I think. He does an amazing job of making you feel like you're right there with him and his intensity and emotion easily trumps everyone else in the movie. Foster needs a breakout role and soon because he is very talented. Eric Bana and Alexander Ludwig round out supporting cast that were worth mentioning in very small roles but important and effective.Something I really liked about this film was that it wasn't your typical American military film where everything works out great and the mission is accomplished and go join the military now. This was a brutal and horrifyingly bad mission gone very very wrong. It is more a story of survival than it is military. Peter Berg irritates me as a director. He has a lot of experience but I've never cared much for his style for some reason. All his films just feel okay to me like there is more that could have been done but he doesn't bother because he's aiming for a certain demographic and 'they won't care.' I'm completely putting words in his mouth but it just feels that way. Lone Survivor could have been a WOW and instead its a...yah that was good. The problem is that I feel like this powerful survival story is mostly forgettable once you're out of the theatre. That reduces it to mindless entertaining and a story like this should be anything but. It is visceral at times, powerful, violent, entertaining...it is absolutely worth seeing. I sort of expected more emotion while watching it though one particular line almost got to me. One of the best scenes, acted and directed, is the scene when they are trying to decide what to do about the compromise in front of them. It is interesting and fascinating to watch how that unfolds. Check it out and take it for what it is and you will enjoy it. 8/10",8,3,9,31 January 2014
Wind River," Would stand solidly behind the words ... and the Oscar Goes to ...
","Best movie of 2017? Maybe. At least the second best in my opinion (see Wonder Woman review) and perhaps a bit of a surprise for me. I love catching an indie flick by chance and being blown away by it. A great crime drama is something of a masterpiece when done correctly. I can think of many over the years that have stayed with me because of the character driven, setting inspired, but real feeling stories and that's what drives home with Wind River. It is character driven, it is absolutely setting inspired and feels incredibly real. I saw Hell Or High Water and enjoyed it but it didn't have the same impact as Wind River. This film is disturbing, visceral, captivating and the characters are subtle but very easy to relate to. I haven't seen Sicario but I've heard good things. Wind River is slow burning but super powerful. It gives a back story that links the characters to the current situation and then builds a mystery and a climax. There are a few mis-steps in how the film unravels but I was still riveted by everything. A film like this relies on tension and atmosphere and the director puts you in the middle of both. It also easily builds back story so that you understand the characters without spending a lot of time dwelling on them. The cast does such a great job because the chemistry between them is so strong. I'm never sure whether or not I like Jeremy Renner but over time he's growing on me in the Marvel Universe. But I was really glad to see him sinking his teeth into something more gritty and real here. Granted he still is playing the lone sulking brooding type of character that Hawkeye is but he does it well and he cares the film like a star should. Elizabeth Olsen also returns to full form as the FBI Agent who is solely unprepared for the case. Olsen and Renner are good together and I like that it's not a sexual/romantic relationship but strictly a partnership. Olsen's character is tough and strong and I like that a lot. Graham Greene has a great role and good chemistry with Renner too but his character's progression and eventual climax is poor at best. They use him very well as a supporting character and then completely waste him in the end. Hugh Dillon, Kelsey Asbille, Ian Bohen, and Jon Bernthal all have strong supporting roles that really bring the story together and put you in the middle of this community reeling from personal problems and crime.This is definitely director Taylor Sheridan's best in my opinion. The style and direction is very good. It might even trump the cast's performance. If you look at the way the movie is filmed you can't help but be impressed. Considering the entire film is this bleak, white wasteland with not a lot to go on, he makes it come to life. Renner's employment as a hunter and knowing the wilderness and tracking predators. The close ups of certain character's faces and the wide-shots of the outdoors and what they're up against. The far shots as though you're often looking through a scope...these are things that would really catch a critic's eye. But regardless if you like a slow burning thriller, this one is great and it gets under your skin and stays with you which is why I think this is one of the best indie films of 2017 and I hope to see them pop up somewhere at the Oscars as unlikely as it is. 8.5/10",8,3,8,24 September 2017
Se7en," One of the greatest films ever made period
","Se7en defines a cult classic. It is a film that was created intrinsically to haunt you for years after you've seen it. I've seen it a handful of times and in watching it again just now I realized how brilliantly it was built. It might be one of the finest handcrafted films ever made. It was like each and every shot and moment and scene was made to let you see something different each and every time or unpack the film for years to come. If you look at fan theories and things you think is true that have nothing to do with the actual film you'll understand how deep the movie goes. It is definitely a cinephile's dream in that you can find so much about the film to explore. But even at a base level, the tension is unbelievable. With each character and moment you can't help but feel like the next moment will be someone's last. The dark, brooding city they create (unnamed and always raining) is haunting. The film holds this true film noire feel and the style of the characters and the office is something from a 1940's Detective film and yet the film clearly is modern times. Each time I watch it I want to know more about the world they exist in and yet we never will but watching each time gives you something new.Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman should have been given Oscars. It might be one of the best Detective teamings in film history. Freeman is the epitome of world weary, ready to retire but haunted by the past cop. Brad Pitt is the idealistic young Detective with the beautiful family just building his life and world and sinking his passion into his work. Both men believe they understand the person they're chasing and yet both underestimate the killer greatly. You're watching this mystery unfold through both men's eyes in different ways and then in the end they both end up on the receiving end of a wicked sense of justice. The killer (I literally refuse to say who it is in case someone hasn't seen this nor knows the twists) is brilliantly played by a well known Hollywood actor. He also should have been given an Oscar. They keep his name from the opening credits and it makes it all the more impactful when he is revealed. He is hands down one of the best 'villains' or killers in Hollywood history in my opinion. The final scene with the three of them in the field is easily a classic moment. Gwyneth Paltrow has a small but impactful and well played role as Pitt's young wife. Her and Freeman forge an unlikely friendship that works very well. I never liked Fight Club...it's true...judge me. BUT David Fincher is still an American Hollywood icon. Some of his other films just literally hit 10's for me easily, probably more than any other director other than maybe Spielberg. But Fincher's style is dark and cuts right through to our very core of what makes us human. Call it horror or noire or thriller but somehow he gets these scripts and creates twists and turns you can barely handle and then gets actors to absolutely knock it out of the park. Gone Girl, Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Se7en, The Game, The Social Network, these are films that are stylistic and character driven and in every case puts you in the middle of the action and makes you feel everything. Se7en is the definitely of a modern day classic and if you love crime films this will be your mother ship calling you home. This will forever by one of my favourite films for a myriad of reasons and I think anyone could sit around and talk about it for years to come. 10/10",10,0,0,24 September 2017
Star Trek," The Ultimate Reboot...an absolutely stunning sci-fi action film that will endear Star Trek to hordes of new fans
","I do enjoy Science Fiction films, but I am far from a Trekkie. Still I have always enjoyed the Star Trek films and thought the new one looked wicked but I never dreamed that it would exceed those expectations and turn the Star Trek franchise into a brilliant reboot that will make legions of new fans. Dealing with a franchise like this is just near impossible let alone trying for perfection and yet the film creators along with director JJ Abrams come as close to perfecting a reboot, redux, remake of Star Trek that anyone could have ever done. They single handedly turn the world's biggest name in Science Fiction into an action powerhouse that creates a whole new amazing cast but still pays an amazing homage to the original series and film. The best part is the film can appeal to anyone, I think that Trekkies can really appreciate it and love the film but the average film goer will love it. Abrams and writer Roberto Orci who has a long list of great films to his credit managed to avoid any judgment on their story by completely changing the Star Trek time line. It might make hard core Trekkies cringe but they can't argue that anything goes when the timeline changes.Chris Pine leads the young, hot cast as the young, wise cracking, risk taking James T. Kirk. He is a far cry from Shatner's Kirk and takes the character in a completely different direction BUT manages to pay true homage to Shatner with a few one liners delivered with perfect Shatner precision but it does not come across as mocking but rather a respectful shout out to the man that made the role famous. Pine is really terrific and he is sure to jump start a huge Hollywood career with this role. I would have thought out of the entire cast that there was no way anyone could do justice to, or pull off the role of Spock. How wrong could I be? Zachary Quinto is absolutely mind blowing as Spock. The rest of the cast is great but Quinto as Spock gives the performance of his career. Karl Urban breathes life into a young, much less composed Bones. The chemistry between him and Pine is terrific in their respective characters. Zoe Saldana doesn't get quite the screen time as other characters but she does great and I hope they give her character some room to expand in sequels. Simon Pegg is absolutely brilliant as Scotty. The most unfortunate part of his role is that he doesn't join the cast until half way through the film. He isn't over used and in fact you want to see more of him. John Cho and Anton Yelchin round out the cast in small roles and do an equally terrific job. There is one rather weak link to the cast sadly but it doesn't drag the film down at all. Eric Bana is very weak compared to everyone else as the 'evil' Nero. He just doesn't have a real strong presence and he's not big and bad enough to feel his threatening nature.I wish I could go on and on about this phenomenal cast. Combined with the constant non-stop action, the brilliant special effects, and the well thought out plot this movie will blow your mind. It was an amazing kick off to the summer blockbusters!! The entire concept of seeing the background of Kirk and the others was the perfect add in for Trek fans or even someone like me with a little knowledge of the Star Trek Universe. Spock is heavily focused on giving Quinto a chance to flourish and he does that with ease. The background and the incredible new story revolving around Spock and his family and The Vulcan people. Also it was truly great the way they added in the significant cameo by Leonard Nimoy playing his legendary role. The role is not forced and actually fits very well. For the record I think Shatner should have been given some sort of cameo. Anyways you must check out Star Trek because I think this is the beginning of a brilliant new series. One of this years best films!! 10/10",10,2,14,12 July 2009
Monster," Dark, twisted, down right disturbing look at a real life serial killer
","I've seen Monster a couple of times now before reviewing it and I think I can safely say that this is one of the darkest most twisted films I've ever seen. The big reason behind that is because this IS real life. This is a real woman, who not so long ago killed people and was in the media. It is fascinating to watch and truly deeply disturbing. True Crime fans should eat this film up because the performances of the two lead actresses are simply stunning. Both women give award worthy performances, and the direction of the film is so well done. It would be hard to call a movie like this 'entertaining' but fascinating and captivating describes it excellently.Charlize Theron goes through unheard of lengths to become the twisted and disturbed Aileen. She is literally unrecognizable and considering she is one of the most beautiful women in the world, his transformation is even more stunning. But that isn't just what makes her performance outstanding...she gives such an incredible performance you will be blown away but what she does. Christina Ricci holds her own against Theron in level of performance because she also is excellent as the often victimized, quiet, and easily abused Selby. Ricci and Theron's chemistry opposite each other is absolutely perfect and the two of them light up the screen.Director and writer Patty Jenkins must have spent so much time studying the facts behind this case because it feels and looks real and you will believe that you are right on the forefront of this killer's mind. The ingenious part of Monster is that this isn't about the case, or her trial or even the crimes themselves. This is a film about the mind of a serial killer. What made her who she was and her very fast downward spiral into insanity. Please see this movie because there is few like it and few films will get under your skin and really disturb you and fascinate you all at the same time. 9/10",9,0,1,12 January 2012
The Maze Runner," A very pleasant sort of sci-fi surprise
","If you follow my reviews, you'll know I watch pretty much everything. I take every opportunity to go to my local theatre and if I haven't seen then I'll see it. I figured if I got around to it, I would see The Maze Runner but I didn't end up getting around to it. I am a big fan of The Hunger Games but the other entries in this new genre of 'teen fiction to big screen' have been underwhelming to me including Divergent, Beautiful Creatures, Twilight and so on. So my expectations going into this were average at best. Sometimes that helps because The Maze Runner ended up being an awesome thrill ride!! It is a terrific story, great moments of sci-fi and fantasy with a dash of Lord of The Flies mixed in there. It made me instantly become a fan of the series and moved seeing any sequels they release to the top of my 'must see' list. Its not the type of film that will take home any awards but as far as sheer popcorn flick entertainment, this one sits pretty darn high. It had a few issues I thought but very well directed, great action, good story, strong main characters and it absolutely is a great start to keep you interested but it also stands on its own merits as well. You really don't feel like you're being left with a lot of unanswered questions although really we are.Relative newcomer (best known from MTV's Teen Wolf Series) Dylan O'Brien actually gives an incredible performance leading this cast. He proves, in my mind, that he could be the next 'It' guy out there. I think he buries any performance by any young guy in the Twilight series. O'Brien has a great charisma and a certain leadership quality that works very well for this cast. The supporting cast for The Maze Runner is actually huge. Because you have this group of young boys all trapped together, you see a lot of faces but only a few stand out and get any sort of depth to their characters. Aml Ameen was very good as their leader Alby, Ki Hong Lee had a couple of very good scenes but he was a character I definitely wanted to see more from and I hope they use him more in sequels, Blake Cooper was very good as Chuck but his character was also a tad predictable, Thomas Brodie-Sangster was really great as second in command Newt (also hope to see a lot more from him in the sequels) and Will Poulter made a really great pseudo-villain/Bully. The most unfortunate part of this cast is the addition of the only female member of the cast (except for a very brief glimpse of Patricia Clarkson) Kaya Scodelario. Now I understand that especially in a film geared towards young adults that the addition of a female hero is necessary but Sodelario's character seems forced into the story for no other reason. She is left completely undeveloped, there is no romance per se and she's honestly pointless to the entire film. They could have easily left her out and it would have made no difference and made the film as interesting and less contrite.I am very impressed that this is Wes Ball's first full length feature film. However, he has also worked on art direction for years and it shows. The special effects and cinematography in this film is brilliant. I am amazed what they were able to do in a very reasonable budget given the type of film. Much like The Hunger Games, I felt like there was a definitive political message behind this film though its a little less 'in your face' than The Hunger Games, its interesting enough to try and figure out what they're saying. You could easily compare this film to the TV Series Lost because many questions are posed and only some are answered but its a fantastic mystery with plenty of action and some scenes that are powerful and moving without being insanely inappropriate for its genre. I am so excited to watch this series continue and grow and I would absolutely watch this again anytime. If you love science fiction and you're tired of the same old...then you might want to give this an honest try!! 8/10",8,2,4,13 December 2014
Inglourious Basterds," Not his best but still a Tarantino twist on the world war genre
","There are a few genres that are very hard to create anything new from and I think the war genre is definitely one of them and yet if anybody could conquer a new spin it would Quentin Tarantino. Inglourious Basterds is not what I thought it was. That's not a bad thing, or a good thing really just an observation. I took the film at face value which appeared to be about a group of misfits put together by a rough talking military man who goes about torturing and putting vengeance on Nazis. Some of that does happen but as it turns out the film is more about the final battle of this group of misfits after they have already made a name for themselves. It also follows another storyline extensively as much as the Inglourious Basterds if not more so. One of the more impressive features of this film is that the Nazi's are consistently on the run in this film. This is like the Return of The Jedi for Jews in World War 2 which I can't say I have ever seen. With the help of the brutal basterds as well as some smart and savvy war victims the Nazi's get a Taratino dose of vengeance, something he does with bloody, gore soaked style.I wasn't sure about Brad Pitt and his performance. In trailers it almost looked cheesy the way that he tried to pull off the roll but once you see the film in context his role is actually very well done. You know there is so much more to his character although you don't get much of a history making him more mysterious. He is a strong leader and fulfilled the big name quota for the film. He isn't the star of the film but rather one piece in a large cast. French actress Mélanie Laurent is terrific as strong willed, tough female Shosanna Dreyfus. Her character is more the lead in this film than anyone else and she is terrific. Tarantino seems to have a way with strong females and Shosanna is no exception and Laurent is great in the role! The complete and utter showstopper is the award worthy performance of Christoph Waltz as the brutal Col. Hans Landa, a true wolf in sheep's clothing. Waltz gives a breath taking performance sometimes funny in a dark and disturbing manner and always brutal. He should not go unnoticed in any way because he steals the scenes. The supporting cast are all great in their smaller roles especially the cast of the Basterds but they don't get a lot of character development and are simply there to further the story and the lead characters.So how does Basterds fall short from Tarantino's other films? I usually find with Tarantino that his films jump around like a blood soaked bunny and keep you constantly on your toes and I found the story dragged perhaps more than it needed to in certain areas. The opening scene in the french countryside is the perfect example because the tension and nail biting action is brilliant. When Tarantino turns up the gore it is shocking and bloody as ever but the action scenes are rather few and far between. Still this takes a world war two film to new heights and would love to see Tarantino tackle this again in a sequel or something different altogether. The gritty setting and the fascinating characters right up to Hitler himself (or the double of Hitler.) While many reviewers say that Basterds takes place in an 'alternate universe' where Hitler is killed, it makes far more sense to look at history and realize Hitler had many, many 'look alikes' to prevent assassination attempts like this one. Regardless this is absolutely worth seeing for Tarantino fans or war genre fans because it is unique and well done. 8/10",8,2,11,8 October 2009
Underworld," The only unique Vampire/Werewolf film ever made...and brilliant at that
","Underworld is indeed a gem. It takes a deadly overused concept and finally comes out with something actually unique with an outstanding cast and concept, great story (if not a little complex) and definite future for turning it into a mega-franchise. Where to begin...Director and co-writer Len Wiseman puts everything together exactly the way a person would want to see it. Action, drama, romance, intensity and vampire and werewolves all round it out but none of it is horror...it's solid action.Kate Beckinsale leads the cast as Selene, the vampire Death dealer who hunts Lycans (Werewolves) in an attempt to exact vengeance for the murder of her mortal family centuries ago. Selene is one of the best action movie heroes ever...period. Beckinsale is dark and beautiful and deadly all at once and she has awesome screen presence. She does an A+ job. Lead actor opposite her is Scott Speedman. I don't think he has near the screen presence of Beckinsale or any of the other cast members but he's adequate and he's fortunate enough to have the rest of the cast be so good that he sort of fits in. The plus side is there is some chemistry between him and Beckinsale, it's not quite as passionate as you would hope for but there is some. Shane Brolly plays Kraven, the villain vampire who is working with the Lycans to bring about the integration of their species basically creating an up-stoppable race of half vampire, half lycan. He's quite brutal in his role and definitely a great bad guy. He doesn't stand a chance against Selene and is put in his place more than once but he's still a good bad guy. Bill Nighy stands out as Viktor, one of the eldest vampires who is in hibernation awaiting his time to rule until Selene resurrects him to gain his support against Kraven. He's an even better bad guy, and a great vampire. Believable in his role and he goes from being weakened and sickly to being a powerful force. His death is one of the coolest...and also laughable moments in cinema history...or action films any ways. Michael Sheen as the leader of the Lycans Lucian. Lucian is almost an anti-hero and he opens up the door for much more of a back story. His role is well done and he adds class to the cast. They are of course many other actors who support the cast and they all do a great job respectfully as either Vampires or Lycans. The Special effects in Underworld are slightly minimal compared to other films of this caliber which is not a bad thing whatsoever, it simply means that the cast must actually work harder to make their roles believable and they do flawlessly. I must admit, after seeing this film again for the second time, and now I have seen the sequel, the story line to this one is a bit complex and you really have to follow it closely to figure out who is who and where the story is going. I'm thinking there is some sort of plot hole going from the first to second film but I can't say for sure and I can't think of anything off hand. If nothing else it means the film is very intelligent for a mainstream action film. I think the series will really show it's strength in a trilogy perhaps. It reminded me a lot of the Matrix series except it didn't start to suck after the first one.Underworld is a must see film for action lovers or anyone who loves a good vampire story because it is very unique. The Vampires aren't evil...some of the usual rules apply to them...but they aren't preying on humans, in fact they have a personal pact to feed on livestock and cloned blood. It's the uncontrollable Lycans who pose a threat and the war rages with guns and hand to hand battles and coming up with new weapons to keep the other immortal team dead. Amidst this is betrayal, romance, and a history that only begins to unfold. You can't help but feel there is so much more to this story. Len Wiseman has created something very interesting here and definitely worth checking out. It's a brilliant story with a brilliant cast and it gets more brilliant with time. 7.5/10",7,0,0,7 February 2006
Iron Man 2," While it slips for the original premise Iron Man 2 still flies solid!
",I think I could find a lot wrong with Iron Man 2. The first film really surprised me as being an amazing super hero origins film and I knew that a second movie or any future instalments would likely fall short. But for everything I could say I didn't like about Iron Man 2 I also think they did a pretty decent job for a high flying summer action flick. There is plenty of new and original ideas and perhaps the only glaring issue is that they take the amazing performance by a great actor and over do it a little bit making the hero of the story seem weaker in some ways but then that is also the basic premise of this sequel. Certainly every great hero needs a great villain and the villain they bring to the big screen for the sequel is quite simply amazing. I had low expectations of who they might put up against Iron Man for the sequel but I was truly blown away. Despite replacing a main character in the story they still managed to carry on terrific chemistry with the cast. Even though some of the characters are a little overblown this time around and the story doesn't have quite the same strength the action and special effects do bring it altogether nicely.Robert Downey Jr. takes his iconic role as philanthropist Tony Stark and Iron Man to new heights and goes through some real emotional moments. The problem is his breakdown in the film is overdone. You almost feel annoyed with his over the top antics to the point where he seems childish. He is still Tony Stark though and no one else could lead the character the way he does. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts in a more significant role this time around. She was terrific in the first film and is still great this time around. She is the grounding force to Downey's Stark and they still have great chemistry despite the story arc putting a wedge between them. This is a strong character for Paltrow. Don Cheadle takes the role of Stark's closest friend from Terrence Howard. I don't think the character was very well explored in the first film but they certainly give Cheadle more to work with and of course his own Super Hero persona as War Machine. War Machine is cool but is he entirely necessary...not in my opinion although that being said some of the great scenes in the film are featuring Cheadle as War Machine. Him and Downey also have great chemistry. Also new to the cast is Scarlett Johansson in a mostly introductory role to the future Avengers cast. She doesn't get much more than other than to allow Downey's Stark to hit on her mercilessly however she does get one incredible action scene where she stuns and amazes as she kicks her way through a group of baddies. I'm not quite aboard this Mickey Rourke craze train but I must say he is an awesome bad guy in the form of Ivan Vanko. They don't give him a lot of actual lines in the film (which is a bonus) and he looks awesome and kicks some serious ass. He is an awesome head villain for the film. Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell round out a supporting cast in good solid roles.While I don't believe the story is quite as good as the first the action is full throttle. There is some truly some great scenes that will put you on the edge of your seat. Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a force to be reckoned with in the directors chair. Iron Man is probably his best project to date. The cast and the over the top characters make this a high flying adventure. Certainly the first film was downright amazing and to follow it up with a solid entertaining second film is worth it. As much as I love a good sequel I think it would be smart to end the Iron Man saga here in favour of The Avengers which I hope they will do a good job with. 8/10,8,1,2,16 July 2010
Two for the Money," Two Powerhouse performers in an averagely filmed story
","Thank the Lord for Mr. Al Pacino and Mr. Matthew McConaughey who single handedly save this film from monotony, perhaps even sheer boredom. Two For The Money does take a new twist on the typical sports/football film by looking at from the perspective of the sports bettor and the people that advise the bettors. The film is a little long (as I've been finding with many films lately...maybe I'm getting old) and there are some rather slow points but because of the performances of the two main stars the film is worth watching 100%!! Pacino plays Walter Abrams, a rather high strung, former everything-a-holic, who is building an empire around sports betting advisory. I really honestly believe this is one of Pacino's best characters. I think his performance as Abrams is Oscar worthy. He's mean and deceitful but human and flawed and you feel sorry for him. He's almost pathetic. Nobody could have done that role more justice, Pacino is brilliant. Matthew McConaughey plays Brandon Lang, a former pro-footballer whose brutal knee injury takes him out of the game. But his love for the game remains and his instinctive ability to know all the teams inside out and backwards makes him a prime candidate for sports betting advisory although he NEVER bets himself. Abrams takes Lange under his wing and immediately begins to build the empire around him. McConaughey plays Lange and his character arc is interesting and he does a great job in an equally award worthy performance (although neither has received any.) The chemistry between the two is spot-on and brilliant and they both do amazingly!! Their scenes together keep the film interesting and watchable. Rene Russo plays Pacino's wife Toni Morrow and although she does an okay job, she's rather disappointing in her role considering the caliber of actress I believe she is. She has no real chemistry with Pacino or McConaughey and she doesn't add much to the cast besides the name.I think Sports fanatics might really enjoy this film but for me I thought it was alright. It certainly showed a side of the sports world you don't usually see in films but TV director D.J. Caruso should thank his lucky stars for the stars in the film because they make an otherwise average movie into a very interesting and watchable film. Sports fans will love the story, and movie lovers will love Pacino and McConaughey. 7/10",7,0,0,5 February 2006
Lords of Dogtown," The Ultimate skater/teenage angst film
","Lords of Dogtown is the skate movie of all skate movies. But beyond that it's a film about fame, friendship, talent, the seventies, and growing up. All the performances are really well done and for fans of skating you'll just love this film. It's done perfectly!! Veteran film maker Catherine Hardwicke captures the seventies brilliantly. The performances by the former hippy culture, the teens experiencing everything the seventies offered and the rebellion they felt. Also the director of the controversial film Thirteen, Hardwicke seems to have a real knack at perfectly capturing teenage feelings and rebellion and Lords of Dogtown shows her ability once again.The big name attached to the film is Heath Ledger and his role is probably underplayed but brilliant nonetheless. I've always liked Ledger, he's one of my favorite young actors ever since 10 Things I Hate About You, and the Patriot. He's really shown his acting ability and is just now really getting acclaim for it with his Oscar nod for playing the gay cowboy in the powerhouse Brokeback Mountain. His performance in Lords of Dogtown is brilliant. He plays Skip, the enormously respected surfer, former hippie, alcoholic, and dreams of riches. He's rough and rugged and you kinda hate him but feel sorry for him too. It's a great performance if not a little small. The main characters in the film, the teenager skaters who make it big are played by John Robinson, Emile Hirsch, and Victor Rasuk. Now Emile Hirsch I came to know from another great little coming of age story...The Girl Next Door where he did a great job in the lead. His role in Lords of Dogtown is completely different...night and day from his previous role and he does a great job. His role as Jay is gritty and dark compared to previous roles. John Robinson as the much more innocent and emotionally strong Stacy also does a great job. He holds everyone together and is much more stable than the rest of them despite being kept out of the group for much of the time. Rasuk plays the star struck, loud, flashy T.A. (Tony Alva.) Driven by his father, and bent on being famous he's the first to go down the wrong path. All three of them can skate something wicked (if they did their own skating, it's unbelievable.) On top of that they have great roles and do a great job. You get drawn into their world as the story takes them from a small group of friends to being torn apart by their own ambitions and offers. Also noteworthy performances are from Michael Angarano who plays Sid. Sid is mostly just a tag along but he gets the benefit of playing terminally ill which for a good actor means a touching role. Also noteworthy is the very small role by Rebecca De Mornay who plays Hippy struggling single Mom Philaine. She does a great job playing something I've never seen her do before. As mentioned the role is small but well done.A great story, with great skating and a really cool setting in the seventies captured brilliantly by the music and clothes and cars and the setting that started skateboarding into a phenomenon. I said to myself that if Tony Hawk didn't do a cameo it would be a disappointment and sure enough I spotted him!! I won't say where...I'll give you the fun of catching him. It's a great cameo. Definitely check this one out because it's well worth watching and a great film!! 8/10",8,1,13,6 February 2006
World War Z," Brilliant summer blockbuster with a surprisingly good story
","First off...I don't care about the source material. I have not read the book yet and I probably will read it but even then I wouldn't care whether or not this stayed true. I am always ALWAYS able to separate film from literature because its really the only way to enjoy them in their own way. Second of all, I don't care this movie is PG-13...in fact I applaud them for not going full on gore, R rated splatter-fest. The way the film is it can appeal to a wider audience and be appropriate for more people. The lack of exploitative gore does not make this a lesser zombie flick. The Zombie genre has just been beaten into a tiny pulp. And yet I am consistently impressed with what film makers and writers manage to do with the genre. Films like this and Warm Bodies and shows like Walking Dead prove that there can still be some fun and entertainment left in a very, very tired genre. World War Z is a zombie flick obviously but its also created to be a disaster movie. It has that style and feel. You will travel from the US to Israel to India and throughout the world. The film does not give you even a moment to breathe. From the opening scenes to the very last it is a go-go-go adrenaline rush that leaves you breathless. The story is actually very well crafted and even the CGI that I thought could break this film is done pretty well.No one can doubt Brad Pitt's star quality. The man exudes a cool, quiet confidence and has great chemistry on screen. I actually found his character a little dry in this at times but Pitt's charisma will win you over. He shows a certain intensity and yet he borders on bland at times which is unfortunate. It doesn't hold the film back and I think the character was just meant to be very in control of every situation. Relative newcomer to the big budget Hollywood scene Mireille Enos plays Pitt's beloved wife. She does a really good job, showing some great intensity. Best of all, she's not a traditional Hollywood beauty but rather someone who looks down to earth and a regular person and I liked that. Her and Pitt had good chemistry. Daniella Kertesz was really great as Segen, the impromptu partner to Pitt's Gerry Lane. Kertesz could easily be a focal point for sequels and her story was captivating. Her mostly supporting role was worthy and stand out. David Morse has a very small cameo role but I feel compelled to mention it because his character was fantastic and twisted. Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove both do a great job as Pitt's children. They don't get a lot of screen time but they fulfil their roles very well. Peter Capaldi, Pierfrancesco Favino and Ruth Negga don't even get character names and yet all three of them did a great supporting job towards the end of the film.In many ways, World War Z is an ensemble cast. Outside of Pitt everyone only gets a little bit of screen time but there are some really great performance. A film like this, chock full of special effects and non-stop action could nearly forget all about story and character development (I'm looking at you Man of Steel) but World War Z proves that you can have all that AND a good story and great characters that you actually care about. The film went through countless production problems and I was pleased to find out that it doesn't effect the final outcome at all. I honestly attribute a lot of that to direction Marc Forster who is quickly becoming a solid force to be reckoned with after Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland and even the lesser known Machine Gun Preacher. He knows how to tell a story and utilize his actors in a big way. He knows that a film needs to be more than just glitz and glam. Certainly the film left itself open for future instalments but I also didn't feel like they left anything out and that it was left open just for a cash grab. The story was complete, it well done, the pacing was near perfect and it didn't feel too long or short. As usual in my opinion the 3D was completely unnecessary. Visually the special effects ranged from decent to really great. The CGI on the zombies was perhaps slightly overdone but far less than I anticipated. This is the sort of summer time blockbuster popcorn flick that makes Summer films worthwhile. It shows up Man Of Steel and Iron Man 3!! See it!! 9/10",9,3,14,27 June 2013
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Cashing in on success can be dangerous...Sarah Marshall proves it
","Judd Apatow struck gold with the surprisingly witty and hilarious 40 Year Old Virgin and then managed to shock and make me roll in the aisles with Knocked Up but now he's rolling out his punches like everything he does is gold and that just isn't the case. His brand of comedy is pure shock value and you can't always say outrageously stupid, crude and shocking things and expect it to be funny. That being said Forgetting Sarah Marshall has a lot of memorable outrageous stupid lines but that is about as far as it goes. It doesn't have the slapstick lovable qualities that Virgin did and it certainly doesn't have the style or wit that Knocked Up had. It goes for something a little more shocking taking it a step further kind of like what was attempted with Superbad which most people loved and I thought it was just okay but it showed a downgrade in the Apatow comedy bit. I never saw Drillbit Taylor but from what I heard that one continued the downward spiral. I mean Forgetting Sarah Marshall's claim to fame was the fact that star and writer Jason Segel goes full frontal and believe me he does but I didn't find it funny or shocking but rather cheap and stupid. However it would appear as though people bought into it gathering the laughter in the back of the room.I think part of the problem was the lead cast. Jason Segel was charming and funny as a bit character in Knocked Up but his transition to leading man doesn't quite work. He just doesn't seem to be right for the part and I couldn't help but continually think that Adam Sandler would have made this movie a million times better. He came across as cheesy and fake and it didn't work. Apatow films have this thing about pairing average or less than average looking dudes with beautiful women which I am all for but they have to have personality like Virgin's Steve Carell or Knocked Up's Seth Rogen. Segel can't carry a movie unfortunately. Kristen Bell is good as the love her or hate her former girlfriend and TV Star. She looks beautiful but her performance is kind of shallow which maybe reflects her character but her chemistry with Segel is lacking something. Mila Kunis looks beautiful as the eye candy and new love interest for Segel but her character is rather shallow too and she isn't supposed to be. She just doesn't get a lot of depth and I think she has the talent but they don't give her much and she doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Segel either...coincidence? Or bad lead casting? The supporting cast is good and not so good. I think the use of Jonah Hill who became an instant star following Superbad was a waste. He wasn't funny at all and he was annoying and got in the way. He stuck out like a sore thumb. I adore Paul Rudd's dry comedy and he is terrific in a sadly small role (maybe he should have taken lead.) But he is still funny. Davon McDonald is also quite amusing in a small role as the bartender. However there is an absolute scene stealer...his name is Russell Brand and he's an English comedian and he absolutely steals the show as sleazy but completely lovable rock star Aldous Snow. I mean the guy is kind of a creep and yet he is incredibly cool, and downright hilarious. I could watch this movie again and again JUST for him. He was awesome and had good chemistry with everyone including Kristen Bell. I would honestly recommend this movie just to watch him, he's awesome!! I didn't dislike Forgetting Sarah Marshall...I just thought it was a very average story with some funny lines but a weak story, an even weaker romance, and tries far too hard to shock you into laughter. I think Apatow needs to take a step back and look at the true talent in his newfound troupe that he likes using (Rogen, Rudd, Segel, Hill) and find out who suits the best role and where. The point is it is pretty dumb and doesn't hold a lot, if any, wit or true comedy. Millions will see it but I foretell a downward spiral when it comes to the Apatow comedies and I think he needs to look for that special spark that endeared him to us in previous good films. Forgetting Sarah Marshall is as average as they come. 7/10",7,3,9,28 April 2008
The Hunger Games," Brilliant and thoroughly under-appreciated by some
","I read the first book of the series and simply haven't had time to go back and read the rest. I am definitely not the type of person to complain about movie adaptations because it is a very different process and I believe both have to be appreciated separately. This movie is not only an amazing mainstream epic but, much like the book, has a lot of depth and really captivating and interesting political undertones. I don't care if this isn't a new concept...what is? So it borrows a basic concept from Battle Royale...BIG DEAL!! We get it...you've seen the Truman Show...get over yourself. The Hunger Games is a brilliantly crafted, cleverly violent, very well acted adventure epic that is worth all the praise it has received. Yes the morality and political concepts are not new but that doesn't make them any less important. I do agree that the film is violent and definitely not for younger viewers but the film makers deserve a lot of kudos for handling the violent elements with class and as appropriate as possible for its demographic. The way they film it absolutely gets the point across and leaves you sick to your stomach without it being gratuitous. I also thought this was one of the best book adaptations I have ever seen. They actually manage to capture nearly every aspect of the book into the film and that isn't easy. They introduce the world and the characters carefully and with excellent pacing and save the actual games for the last third of the film.New Hollywood superstar Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't have necessarily been the first actress I would have thought for Katniss. I always pictured her younger. However, now, Lawrence IS Katniss. She is strong willed, rough around the edges, an amazing heroine. She is probably one of the best female heroes in film history I think. She isn't fake or overplayed and she feels real and passionate and charismatic on screen. She is the heart and soul of this film. Josh Hutcherson is Peeta, Katniss' fellow tribute in her district. I feel like Hutcherson seems a little out of his league at times in this film. He isn't bad in the role and he and Lawrence have good chemistry but he definitely pales in his performance next to Lawrence and comes across as very needy which I didn't get the vibe from his character in the book. Both of them are great though at capture different sides of being a Hunger Games tribute and some of the best scenes are the sheer look of terror, amazement and stunned fearful anticipation from the reaping to the actual games. Liam Hemsworth seemed to get talked about a lot for his role as Gale but he really has very little screen time. That being said he establishes a fantastic chemistry with Lawrence and you definitely hope to see more of him in future sequels. The supporting cast of the film is nearly brilliant. Stanley Tucci (one of my favourite supporting characters), Elizabeth Banks, Willow Shields (again very little screen time but impressive setup for a character), Wes Bentley, Woody Harrelson (also one of my favourite characters--and Harrelson is brilliant in his portrayal), Lenny Kravitz, Amandla Stenberg (great in her role but the role is really downplayed in the film considering how important it is to the overall story), and the Presidential and deliberately evil seeming Donald Sutherland as President Snow (a role I hope we see far more of in the future.) The other tributes in the games are all very good but short lived and don't get a lot of screen time. There are truly many terrific performances in the film from the entire cast.There was a lot of negative reactions to Gary Ross' directing in The Hunger Games. He does love the shaky cam style but for the most part it works in this movie. You need the chaotic feel and you also need to avoid showing gratuitous violence while still getting the message across and like it or not the shaky cam does that well. He still crafts the dysotopian world brilliantly. The characters are vibrant and the film moves along at a terrific pace considering it clocks in at two and a half hours. I think its noteworthy that Gary Ross hasn't had a lot of experience directing but he absolutely knows how to create a terrific story. This deserves every bit of the attention and money that it gets. It is a mainstream epic that was created with great thought and care and let's hope they continue the series with the same quality. 9.5/10",9,1,7,5 December 2013
The Impossible," Powerful, effective, emotional and thriller
","I really didn't know what to expect from The Impossible. I sort of thought it might end up being more of an art-house film with a lot of symbolism and bizarre cinematography. I really only thought this because of Naomi Watt's Oscar nomination in the role. I didn't think a typical 'disaster' flick would get a nomination. I was incorrect. The Impossible actually is more of straight up disaster flick but with more power and emotion and the basis on real life factored with how fresh this is in everyone's mind makes it even more powerful. I don't mean to downplay it by calling it 'just a disaster flick', but it doesn't have any of the symbolism or art-house qualities I was worried it would have because I really believed that would have ruined it. There were two scenes in the film that I thought tried to channel that and they seemed odd and out of place. Also Naomi Watt's nudity in the film is completely pointless and blatant. It seems as though because Watt's does nudity they felt it necessary to force it in there. It distracts from the point of the movie. Those two scenes and the brief nudity aside the film is brilliantly done and incredibly powerful pulling on your heartstrings nearly from beginning to end.The cast is really quite amazing. Naomi Watts does an amazing job at making you feel everything her and her family is going through and you will ache for her and feel her pain. She plays the part flawlessly and proves what a great actor she is. She deserved her nomination which went mostly overlooked. Ewan McGregor does a great job as well, playing the relentless father and husband desperately searching for his family. McGregor doesn't give the strongest performance in the film but I know he's a great actor and he is still great in his role. Their three kids played by Tom Holland, Samuel Joslin, and Oaklee Pendergast went completely under-appreciated. If anyone deserved an Oscar nomination it should have been Tom Holland who was simply breathtaking in his role as the eldest son dealing with losing his family and caring for his dying mother. He had several scenes that were awe inspiring for a young actor. Same could be said for Joslin and Pendergast who are so young and yet brilliant in their roles. The five of them have such incredible chemistry and you will completely believe their family bond which is so important for this movie.The only other film I recognize from Juan Antonio Bayona is The Orphanage and I have not seen that yet. Still, from this movie alone I am inclined to believe he is a truly talented director. He takes on a very fresh wound in making a film about the Asian Tsunami but it never once feels like its taking advantage of its victims, minimizing what happened or exploiting the situation. The cinematography is stunning and the initial scene of the Tsunami is literally gut wrenching. Your stomach sinks and you feel terror seeing that incredible wave coming towards them. Of course nothing compares to the real situation which was devastating and horrifying but this really does put it into a perspective we might not have seen before. I felt the film really did chase the good cry angle meaning they really play up the tearful reunions by saturating the latter half of the film with it but it works so what can I say about that. You won't be disappointed at all, but be warned that its not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. It certainly goes for the jugular when trying to shock you with certain scenes of violence and gore and Tsunami torn countryside but once again, it works. 8.5/10",8,1,2,11 March 2013
42," Pass me my Oscar ballot...I need to make some checks
","Maybe I'm getting soft or maybe I was just hoping to find some better films in 2013 than I did in 2012. I didn't hand out a single 10/10 in 2012...no kidding. Closest I came was Les Miserables and Life of Pi. Now this year this will already be my second 10/10 and I'm proud to give it to them both. My first was Evil Dead...a vastly different movie than this. I suspected I would enjoy 42, what I didn't expect was to be completely and utterly blown away by it. How many times have we seen this type of film? How many times have we seen films that fought racism and showed us a time in history when people struggled to be equal? For that matter, how many times have we seen an uplifted baseball film? Well it doesn't matter because this one is so beyond inspirational, it is brilliant and breathtaking and gives us at least two of the best performances I have seen in months if not years. 42 had me in tears at every turn, it had me cheering and laughing and crying and feeling every gambit of emotion. It is impeccably created and made with such heart that it just reeks of film greatness. It is so incredibly entertaining but this film is so much more than that. This is the type of brilliantly made film making that teaches us, inspires us and reminds us of history.There are two performances in this film that if they don't get Oscar recognition I'll be thoroughly surprised but then the Academy doesn't much care for this type of mainstream film no matter how good it is. Chadwick Boseman in basically his big screen debut is astounding and mind blowing as the one and only Jackie Robinson. Boseman is passionate and real and just gets to you in every way and he just comes across as a baseball hero. He looks the part, plays the part and is brilliant in the role. There is no justice if he doesn't get recognized for this role in Award season somewhere. Second only to his performance is the amazing Harrison Ford. I've loved Ford for years as many of us have but this was something I did not expect. Lately, in his films he's seemed to show his age and not have the same heart he once had but this was stunning. He is riveting as Branch Rickey. This is his big opportunity to win an Oscar because he just nails this role in every which way. The chemistry with him and Boseman is perfection and both men bring history to life and knock it out of the park (pun intended.) The supporting cast were also excellent. Some of the best performances to watch for are Nicole Beharie as Jackie's devoted wife, Christopher Meloni was really good as Leo Durocher, Ryan Merriman, and Lucas Black are worth mentioning in small but pivotal roles as Jackie's team mates. Andre Holland is really good but sort of underused as Wendell Smith. I suspect that a historical figure like Smith could almost handle his own film and they didn't want him to over power Jackie Robinson's story. Holland still did a great job in a small role. Alan Tudyk had a fairly small role in the film but man...if small roles make an impact, this guy made it HUGE!! Tudyk is infuriating and captivating as Ben Chapman. Easily the best scene in the film (and the most eye-opening and disturbing) is the scene with Tudyk's Chapman mercilessly taunting Boseman's Robinson.Brian Helgeland wrote the script and helm-ed the film and he is a talented guy as a write. He has written some of the best horror/Sci-fi and drama and he clearly knows how to exact emotion from his audience. His directing shows less experience but 42 proved he knows how to translate his skill as a writer onto the big screen. I was annoyed by the trailers of this film because of the inexplicable and unnecessary rap music playing over the clips of 1940's Baseball. Much to my relief, that was strictly to bring in the mainstream crowds. The film stays true to its time period and will immerse you in the good, bad and ugly of the 1940's sports world. I'm not an overly emotional movie watcher but when a movie really pushes my emotions to the limits, I have great respect for it and 42 did that and more. It is a baseball movie of course but there is so much more to it than that. This is about pioneering civil rights and what a player like Jackie Robinson meant to people. I encourage you to see this and tell others to see it because this is a powerhouse of a movie that was not given its just rewards when it was released. Yes it did 'well' but this is beyond just good. Bravo. 10/10",10,1,2,13 July 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Swashbuckling returns huge but lacks the heart ironically enough
","I had very high expectations for Pirates 2 Dead Man's Chest. I did know if not subconsciously that Pirates 2 would most certainly suffer from being a sequel let alone the middle installment of a trilogy. Now don't get me wrong...Dead Man's Chest still captures and delivers the swashbuckling adventure, returns many, if not nearly all the original members of the cast including some obscure ones (the Undead Monkey.) The film also does a terrific job and melding together the first and second films keeping a very close eye on linking them properly and having a continuous storyline. The film has some truly amazing fight scenes and stunt scenes (although not as many as the original) and some of the characters get a big boost into the spotlight. But when all is said and done the plot of the second film is a little bit complicated and must be very closely followed, the villain as creepy and crazy as he looks doesn't near have the heart or talent of the irreplaceable Geoffrey Rush, and some of the main characters including the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow have lost some of their heart. BUT the CGI is greatly improved considering the enormity of the special effects, the setting is still perfect and the adventure soars!! Johnny Depp probably set his career high as the anti-hero Jack Sparrow. He will be a movie classic character forever and no one but Depp could play him. It's a brilliant role and he HAD to return. There was no shortage of Jack Sparrow action and he still is great but it just seemed like he lacked the heart that he had for the character in the original. I suppose some of that would come from this being not the creation of a unique character but rather carrying him over. Some of the scenes felt a little forced to try and re-establish Jack's outlandish personality. He also felt less like the reluctant hero in this film and more like a true blood Pirate with a bit of an evil side to him which doesn't really fit Jack Sparrow...he just didn't seem himself. Orlando Bloom returns as high spirited youngster William Turner. Now Bloom perfectly captures the character he created in the original. Turner is the perfect hero, swash buckling, a little bit of pirate but honorable and handsome. Although I will say people tend to get the better of him more often than not in this film especially in a sword fight. Depp and Bloom have lost all their chemistry they shared with their reluctant friendship in the first one. They seem more like enemies now unfortunately. Someone whose character really blossomed in this second film is the lovely Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann. Swann who was a strong female lead in the original really gets to kick some butt and poke fun at the female persona in the 1800's. She's sassy, strong and quite striking in this film. (My male opinion of her had dropped significantly after Domino BLECH!!) She gets far more swordplay of her own, some really great action scenes and a more significant role. Unfortunately they make her character less credible and destroy the intense romance between Will and her with a sub plot about her lust for Jack Sparrow. Bill Nighy plays the entirely CGI'd evil villain Davy Jones. He does well but just doesn't hold your attention like Geoffrey Rush did with his villain. He certainly looks evil enough and plays a big part in the overall plot of this film, the earlier film and the next one by the sounds of things. Stellan Skarsgård makes a reasonably important and very well acted appearance as Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's Father. Talked about in length in the first one but this is his first appearance. Skarsgård is an effective actor and is a very emotional character in this role. Jack Davenport makes an interesting return as former Commander Norrington. He is another of the characters who definitely got more of a break out role. He's villainous and yet one of the good guys in many ways. He is also vitally important to the next film and how everything unfolds.Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is definitely not without it's 300 million dollar (and climbing) charm. There is truly some memorable moments including the sword fight on the enormous water wheel and the escape from the hanging cage made from crew members bones. As a sequel and in that vein it is quite well done and very worth seeing if there is anyone left on the face of the planet who hasn't seen it. It reminds me a great deal of the original Star Wars trilogy each one establishing characters, romance, intrigue, action and a beloved ship...Millennium Falcon vs The Black Pearl. I don't know if Pirates will capture the hearts like Star Wars did but so far it's a terrific series but absolutely make sure you see the superior original before seeing this sequel. Altogether so far it's been fun!! 8/10",8,1,2,22 July 2006
Rocky V," A fitting film for #1800 reviews and Sly's special Day
","This is 1800 reviews for me and I usually try to pick something important to me for these milestone reviews. There isn't much more important to me than the films of Sly Stallone for a number of reasons, some more personal than others. I just went through the Rocky Series again for the umpteenth time loving them as much as I ever have but I had yet to review Rocky V so here I am. And the irony is that this is considered the worst of the series and rightfully so. It is definitely a departure from the franchise. There are some good things about it but the problem is that it doesn't feel like Rocky. It doesn't have the same heart or style and the fact that it ends in this street fight just feels so un-Rocky like. However, it does definitively show a huge arc in the character we all know and love. Truly thank goodness, Rocky Balboa came out 16 years later to do justice to the franchise and not leave it on this note. The positive thing is that this is still about rising above. It's watching Rocky struggle as he loses everything and has to start from the beginning. It also sets him up basically for the rest of his life as we find out in Rocky Balboa and later Creed.I'm sure I've said this before but anyone who claims Sylvester Stallone can't act or is untalented needs to look again. He is an incredible Oscar-winning writer who created this indelible character who has lasted forty years successfully. Even in Rocky V which is disliked greatly, he is still the hero he always was and the character that is perfectly crafted by Stallone. He literally turns into Rocky and you're mesmerized. The scene with him watching Gunn fight and his brain issues is disturbing almost bringing tears to my eyes. Stallone is a powerhouse even if this is his worst script for writing. Happy 70th Birthday Mr. Stallone, my hero, my larger than life idol. The entire cast returns, Taila Shire gives her final Adrian performance and definitely has some great scenes and still has incredible chemistry opposite Stallone. Burt Young almost plays a bit of an accidental 'bad guy' as he is the cause of Rocky losing everything. This is a toned down performance for him but he is still an integral part of the series. Sage Stallone is actually the scene stealer in this film. Sage is fantastic as the young Rocky Jr. The best part of this film is the dynamic between Sage and his real life father Sly. This film revolves around father and son and does that one aspect of it well. More or less his only film credit, real life Heavyweight Boxer (briefly) Tommy Morrison plays Rocky's protégé turned nemesis Tommy Gunn. Morrison doesn't hold a candle to any of other Rocky's nemesis in the films and certainly not to the first 4. He doesn't even seem to be in the same boat. Morrison and Michael Anthony Cane who plays a blatant attempt at Don King are both very cheesy and B-Movie quality which drags down the film significantly.Besides Rocky being the underdog and a force of nature the thing fans love about this series are training montages and the final fight. Rocky V has neither of this. And not only do you not get an epic final boxing bout in a the King of Boxing epics but it's reduced to a street fight that is okay at best. I am actually floored that this was directed by John G. Avildsen who directed the original Rocky. But maybe he got lucky with that one? If you look at all his other films over 4 decades, nothing else stands out as being impressive or a work of art. He certainly knows how to give Rocky and his Philadelphia world that grit and poor look but this is a weak script with very little to be impressed by or remember in this series. Still as a huge fan, I watch it every time I go through the franchise because it belongs and it has it's plus' (the Stallones' for one thing) and it's important for Rocky's story because this was his real life down and out before he came thundering back 16 years later with the incredible Rocky Balboa. 6.5/10",6,1,1,7 July 2016
Argo," The ins and outs of Argo and why I'm scratching my head yet again
","I actually had high expectations for Argo. I mean how could you not when we've been inundated with trailers for this film for months now. My expectations were also kept in check by the fact that I knew chances are you basically saw the entire film in the half dozen trailers that existed. That turned out to be exactly correct. However, the trailers still looked good and I love a good political thriller especially based on true events so I was excited. I enjoyed Argo. I thought it was good. But that's the furthest you'll get me to go. Academy Award material? Absolutely not, not in my opinion. I am literally scratching my head trying to figure out why critics chose this movie to latch on to and rave about. Its a good story, its decently directed, the late seventies, early eighties setting is especially well done but the action is really just okay, characters are underused in favour of focusing on the event itself and the film only really gets interesting and riveting in the last half hour when they are finally escaping Iran. Ironically, the last half hour is what critics of the film and real life people involved didn't like because it was a 'dramatization' and Hollywood-ized to make the film interesting. Yah and? It should be about entertainment and still tell a good story. The last half hour is thrilling and edge of your seat although opens some element of plot holes because how is it Iranian Government can't just stop a plane from taking off from their airport but rather have to chase it down the runway with guns? Ben Affleck directs and stars in the film and has gotten endless critical acclaim for it. The direction is very well done. His performance felt monotone to me. He was a one note hero that they try to humanize and give a background to but this film solely rests on the laurels of its story and not the characters themselves. Alan Arkin is Oscar nominated for his role and for what?!? I love Alan Arkin...he has given some incredible performances but they're nominating him for angrily stomping through a studio and swearing at people like an angry old man? Because that was the extent of his character. I realize he played a vital role in the entire plan but that felt lost in this story. The exact same could be said for John Goodman's character. Again, I love John Goodman and the person he portrayed was clearly of the utmost importance to this real life mission but his character felt like he was just there in this. He had no depth and at the end of the film we get this little blurb about John Chambers as though he was a HUGE part of the film and instead Goodman felt like nothing more than a cameo. Bryan Cranston was definitely not much more than a passing cameo with a few decent lines that you see every single one of in the trailer. Victor Garber was decent as the Canadian Ambassador but again there was no depth to the character. The six hostages were all good in their roles and they all certainly looked very much like their real life counterparts but I couldn't even name them or tell you who was who.The film wasn't bad, please don't get me wrong. I think you could sit down and enjoy the story it tells as it was a very important moment in history. Is it a Yay, Go America story...well yes a little bit but not as much as some would say. It certainly pays proper respects to the Canadians' role in it as well. Perhaps Affleck and the writers didn't want to cloud up the true story with too much focus on the individual characters, I can accept that. But then to give any of these actors acclaim for their roles just seem silly because they weren't given any sort of depth to sink their teeth into. I just don't understand why critics grab hold of something and rave about it when I don't see anything truly outstanding about a movie like this at all. It was good, but far from great. I don't believe it'll be a classic film in twenty or thirty years and firmly sits in the vein of being mediocre all around. I guess that's why to each their own. See for yourself because I am almost certain it will win Best Picture this coming Sunday but so far from what I have seen the only Best Picture nominees deserving of it are Les Miserables and Life of Pi but then I still have three more to see. 7/10",7,1,2,19 February 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," The Epic of all Pirate films...brilliant, a classic for certain
","Pirates of the Caribbean I think came as a surprise to a lot of people. Had Hollywood gone too far...basing a film on an amusement park ride??!! Slapping a 150 million dollar budget on it and putting huge stars in the mix?? Well it wasn't a mistake and Disney knocked one out of the park with this incredible swashbuckling adventure that completely invigorates the 'Pirate' film, not that I can think of any others at the moment. Pirates is possibly one of the greatest adventure films I've ever sat through. Completely unashamed of it's 2 1/2 hour time frame and although still to this die hyped as a kids movie it's pretty brutally violent at times with freaky undead pirates and plenty of sword play and guns blazing. Director Gore Verbinski creates this entire Caribbean world with all this legend and lore and it just draws you into it's people and places and the adventure ahead of them. It is non stop adventure!! On top of all this is a guaranteed cinema classic character...the one, the only Oscar Nominated performance of Captain Jack Sparrow by Johnny Depp. How can you sum up Captain Jack Sparrow, he's an anti-hero...not quite a good guy, tries very hard to be a bad guy but also has a very high moral standard according to the Pirate Code. One of the great lines in the film is when they think Jack is screwing up an attempt at stealing a ship and a naval office comments 'That has to be the worst pirate I've ever seen..' and then tides change and they realize Jack has duped them and taken off with their ship and the same officer exclaims moments later 'That has to be the best Pirate I've ever seen..' Depp brings the character of Sparrow to life in a way I've rarely seen. Jack Sparrow is a brilliant, vibrant, fun, hilarious, tough hero with such a unique personality. If for no other reason he makes this film and Depp IS Sparrow and deserved that Oscar nod for this. Orlando Bloom is the young handsome swashbuckler/blacksmith who gets involved in this adventure over the love of a woman. Bloom plays young William Turner who doesn't realize he is the son of a famous Pirate. Bloom who I often find rather drab and low brow seems to make that work for him in many roles and this is no exception. He still manages to be subtly vibrant and him and Depp play such an incredible duo playing off each other in action scenes and comedy all at once. This is the pirate version of a buddy cop movie and Bloom and Depp are perfect together. Bloom's performance is in many ways the exact opposite of Depp's Sparrow and it works wonderfully. He is the perfect hero...handsome, in love, quiet and strong. Keira Knightley is the lovely Elizabeth Swann, daughter of the Governor and a bit of a dreamer when it comes to adventure and pirates. Secretly in love with William Turner she is being promised to another man who is a 'better match.' Knightley is terrific as Swann because she is as strong a character as any of the male leads. She holds her own against all of them and her character is feisty, strong and holds her own in battle. She does all this while still appearing lady like as to the time of the film. The absolutely phenomenal Geoffrey Rush plays Captain Barbossa, Jack Sparrow's brutally evil nemesis who has stole his ship and crew from him but has been cursed by a treasure. Barbossa is Captain Hook with a shot of evil in him. He's brutal and convincing and Rush is brilliant. Him and Depp have terrific chemistry as enemies and he is a great adversary and probably one of the best movie villains of all time.The chemistry and performance between these four actors make this film as brilliant as it could be. Add into that an absolutely stunning story and script that mixes true action with laugh out loud comedy, physical stunts and special effects. Being a huge anti-fan of CGI I was a little disappointed with the hokey look of the undead Pirate Crew, I think they could have done more with good old fashion special effects. The crew looks clunky and fake when they are CGI'd out but even still it doesn't ruin the film by any means. Adults will love this just as much as kids if kids should even see it. There is plenty of the good guys specifically the English Navy who die at the hands of pirates and the pirates are pretty brutal as well and there are some really creepy scenes and I think adults will love this one!! Don't let the Disney stamp scare you away because you can't get adventure better then this one...I guarantee it...savvy?? 9/10",9,0,3,5 July 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," Sheer brilliance! Abram's Star Trek might be the best flick of the summer
","When Abram's rebooted Star Trek he had perhaps the most uphill battle ahead of him of any director...ever. Millions of the most die hard, obsessive and fastidious fans ever would be staring at him. For many...he ticked them off there is no doubt. However, for most he knocked it out of the park! The first film was a brilliant sci-fi epic reboot. How would a second outing fare? Well let me tell you...JJ Abrams has set a standard of Sci-Fi action that few others will ever touch. But beyond that the film sets a standard for action films and summer blockbusters. Into Darkness is a riveting, brilliant, adrenaline fuelled masterpiece. The characters that we all love are given such a range and when you think it couldn't leave you on the edge of your seat anymore, it does again and again. The film gives us an incredible villain that is so vital to a film like this. The special effects, much like the first one, were absolutely bang on. CGI can be so tricky and completely overused and even worse done poorly but Into Darkness is breathtaking to look at and the CGI and special effects are very near flawless. Every time you see the Enterprise it is epic and just awe inspiring.Chris Pine returns as the iconic Captain Kirk. He is absolutely a different Captain Kirk than Shatner and that's a good thing. He is a star and his charisma on screen is perfect. His hero is a flawed one and makes many mistakes but is always first there to the rescue. Pine carries the film effortlessly. I'm sure I raved about him in the review for the first film but Zachary Quinto is amazing. As far as I'm concerned this was an Oscar worthy performance from him and I truly mean that. His Spock is so brilliant and captures the essence of the iconic Leonard Nimoy while making his own mark on the character. Spock has such an incredible and emotional arc in this film and Quinto is brilliant at it. The chemistry between him and Pine is near perfect. The whole Enterprise crew returns once again. Its just incredible that Abrams or whomever cast this film was able to find a group of people that work so well together. Not only do they work well together but they completely embody these characters that we were created so long ago and are so iconic. They pay a respectful homage to those original characters and create a whole new persona as well. Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, Simon Pegg, John Cho and Anton Yelchin are amazing in their roles. The film does a great job at balancing everyone as equally as possible so that everyone can find their favourite character. Bruce Greenwood also returns in a cameo type role as Pike but a very important character and he's great as well. It was a pleasure to see Peter Weller in a major supporting role. He is a terrific adversary to Kirk and the guy just looks villainous. This is certainly one of his best roles in a very long time. Alice Eve is also a new addition to the cast and the one very big downside to this cast. I have said many times before in reviews that Alice Eve is gorgeous...I have a huge crush on the girl, however...she isn't a great actress. She tries hard enough but I have yet to see her in anything impressive. Her character is unnecessary in the film and she sticks out amongst the cast. And finally we have perhaps the best performance hands down is by Benedict Cumberbatch. Now, the spoilers of who he is has been dredged all over the internet and ticked off legions of fans. I won't specifically do that again. But he is a villain and an incredible one at that. His presence on screen is epic and perfect and one of the best villains I've seen in a very long time! Abrams rebooting of this franchise making back to back blockbusters like this makes him one of the best directors in my books. It makes me feel completely confident for Star Wars. In the first film I think he paid a very respectable homage to the original content. This is coming from a non-Trekkie but I am still learning about the little Easter Eggs from that first film. Now with his one, he upped that ante and paid such incredible respect to the original series. The entire scene near the end of the film with Kirk and Spock was done in such an incredibly moving and well done way. Obviously it is hard for people to go into this without astronomical expectations, especially die hard fans but I encourage everyone to go and see this and have fun because this is the type of summer Blockbuster to be thrilled over!! I go with my gut and for me this was near perfectly executed. 9/10",9,11,21,27 May 2013
Hostel," One of the sickest films ever made!!
","I think I've pretty much seen it all. Especially as an intense horror fan for the last 15 years, I've watched almost every kind of horror and gross out blood spattered film out there and Hostel made my skin crawl!! I have to say that there is an enormous percentage of human beings that should NEVER see this film because god knows there is enough sick twisted psycho's out there. What differentiates this from other blood soaked, gory films?? Reality. There is something very real about Hostel, there is something abnormal and disturbing about the situations, the setting, the captives and the men torturing them. Or perhaps it's just the incredibly sick premise in the first place that will turn your stomach. If this film was any more intense I'm not sure I would have been able to sit through it. I almost feel like slapping a disclaimer on this review because although I seem to dump praise on the film with a nine out of ten...I don't feel many should see this unless you've got a STRONG stomach, and a need to see something abnormally twisted. But fifty million dollars worth of people have already seen it. Perhaps Eli Roth's sick creation is this day and ages Texas Chainsaw or even The Exorcist which shocked and awed people decades ago.It's not the buckets of blood or even the goriest scenes, it's just the imagery and the acting. The lead actors do a top notch job. The film starts out for the first half hour or more and I was beginning to wonder what I was watching because it seemed more like Harold and Kumar go to Europe with another guy. Getting high, 'F' this, 'F' that and showing breasts every possible chance just for the sake of doing so. No hint or horror anywhere in sight. And then comes the intrigue when the friends began to disappear one at a time. A factory in a small European town allows rich men to pay to dismember, operate, murder, do anything they want to live human victims who are tourists that are being kidnapped right off the street. In all fairness there is a small handful of gory, disturbing scenes amidst a basic story but those scenes are powerful enough to make you crawl to your core. Derek Richardson plays the lonely, geeky, Josh. He does a good job although he disappears early but his paranoia is the first to be explored as he suspects something isn't right. His scenes being tortured and murdered are gut wrenching and his screams are terrifying. That's not an easy thing to pull off in such a capacity. Newcomer Eythor Gudjonsson plays horny, party guy Oli and in that rank he does fine. He never really gets to show off his acting chops as we never actually see him getting taken or murdered. The real shining star of the film is Jay Hernandez. Over the years I've seen him in many other things but he has never stuck out or shined like he does in Hostel. He performs the crazy party teenager part to the point where I thought...these kids are just stupid annoying teenagers and then he gets submersed in with the killers and fights his way out. He commands the screen, and is definitely leading man material and his screams and scenes of torture are brutal. The three men shown to be the torturers also do a good job especially Jan Vlasák who actually meets the boys on a train to Bratslava. He seems like such a normal, every day businessman, with a family, friends, personable and then to see him in the capacity of a sick twisted killer is revolting. The supporting cast are all very well done but the main character(s) really do make this film.Eli Roth who both wrote and directed the film has created something far beyond his usual average campy films. This film is very, very real. It holds a record for using the most languages in a film with no subtitles which simply holds it's realism. Filmed entirely in Europe the setting is both beautiful and frightening, dark and grim, old fashion, something very creepy about every scene. Blood and gore is everywhere as well as female nudity abound...it's a cash cow without a doubt but it's also well made and hits the mark as a disturbing, psychotic thriller. I can honestly say I don't wish to...and hopefully will not ever watch Hostel again because it's something I don't wish to sit through. Not because it's a bad film...it's brilliant...but because it's that disturbing!! For anyone and there will be plenty who says this was crap and not scary and yadda yadda yadda...I think you better make an appointment with your shrink. 8/10",8,1,3,25 January 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," One of the greatest Fantasy Epics of all time!!
","To describe this film as beautiful doesn't even to begin to explain what it encompasses. The world that C.S. Lewis created in words comes to life in a vision that is just drop dead gorgeous. For me Chronicles of Narnia was so brilliant and epically told and was not made with just children in mind but rather for everyone. The actors in the film do an incredible job of going from mere children to heroes of this magical world. Although you might think that they would have rushed it (trying to fit everything from the book into the film) everything fits together so nicely and flows at a terrific pace considering the 2 1/2 hour time frame. It felt like an hour!! Chronicles of Narnia just stuns you and keeps you completely riveted to this fairly tale like world and story. While it is dark enough to keep you enthralled it has this wonderful spiritual undertone, the exact way in which I believe Lewis had envisioned his books and the film makers actually managed to keep that feel alive. It doesn't try to hide the spiritual significance that likely some won't get but those who are looking will still find it.Newcomer Georgie Henley who plays the youngest and the first to discover Narnia is a delight to watch. She's adorable and has some terrific expressions and moments in the film. She will for certain be a familiar face in films to come. William Moseley who plays the oldest, protective brother Peter also does a great job of becoming the knight and protector of Narnia. Anna Popplewell as the eldest sister also does a great job. I must admit I was not an 'Edmund' fan. That was the youngest brother. I know he was meant to have a bit of a mean streak in him but I never quite thought that Skandar Keynes performed as well as the other children in the film. But he couldn't possibly bring it down. Tilda Swinton plays the evil White Witch and plays a brilliant adversary to the Children and to Aslan and it's no small mention that her sheer image added to her character. She was downright disturbing to look at!! She is most certainly a memorable villain in film history.Director Andrew Adamson who, up until now, has been telling his fairy tales on the animated screen front with Shrek and Shrek II performs his greatest film to date with this remarkable creation. This is absolutely sure to be an instant classic that will exist forever. The absolutely amazing CGI creations of animals and the voices that went with them created such amazing and real characters. The Beavers, the fox, and of course the incredible Aslan himself (voiced by Liam Neeson.) They created and treated Aslan like he was meant to be...a true King. From his introduction, to his death, to his resurrection, it was all done with such reverence. Normally not a CGI fan, but I wasn't bothered by the beautiful CGI creations in this film. The Battles in the film, no matter how 'toned down' were still magnificent and thrilling and still not for the younger viewers as they still managed to be more than a little violent although in the end all the good live again with the help of a magic potion given to Lucy by none other than Santa Clause himself (although he is never named as such.) The film is just such a brilliant fairy tale, beautiful and enthralling and will draw you in for the 2 hours and never take a breath. You could watch this a million times over and never get bored. I think this is one of the best adventure films I have ever seen!! The ending for me was almost a little too cutesy but this truly is meant to be a wholesome, touching film much like C.S. Lewis intended his stories to be I am sure. You must see this, alone or with your family, it's beautiful!! 10/10",10,0,1,28 December 2005
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Really terrific dark comedy that is a gem!
","I had heard from several people that Crazy Stupid Love was good so I had some decent expectations when I saw it for the first time but it met those expectations easily. This is the perfect movie for everyone because it is definitely a romance movie but also part comedy and heavy drama. Women and men can enjoy so many different aspects of this film but the key to it is the characters. This is absolutely a character driven film and you will laugh and smile and cry and just truly be enthralled by these people and their life.Steve Carell proves once again what an incredibly versatile actor he can be. He is truly outstanding as the suddenly jolted Cal who has to basically find himself again. This is a coming of age movie for a forty something year old man. Carell has this way about him that is so emotional and funny but has this dark comedic element to him. Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as the smooth talking ladies man Jacob Palmer. Gosling and Carell have such amazing chemistry in this movie that they bring out the best in each other. I'm not usually a big fan of Julianne Moore but she is pretty good in this. I don't think she lives up the level put forth by Carell or Gosling or some of the other cast members but she fits into the cast well and has good chemistry. Emma Stone is terrific in her role. Her and Gosling have great chemistry and they seem odd for each other and yet they fit so well. Her character is fantastic and the twist to the film will leave you shocked! Jonah Bobo deserves mention because he is also absolutely excellent as Carell's son Robbie who is having a coming of age of his own. His role isn't big but its effective and he is great in it. Marisa Tomei and Kevin Bacon round out the supporting cast and they're decent in their roles though they don't stand out.If I had to nail one genre to Crazy Stupid Love I think I'd call it a drama and yet there are so many scenes that are just truly funny, whether its dark funny, or awkward funny, or slapstick...this movie has it all. One of the best scenes I have seen in a film in a long time is the scene in Carell's backyard when everyone shows up and a fight breaks out, it was absolutely hilarious and yet heart wrenching all at the same time and that pretty much describes this whole movie. This is the perfect Saturday night date movie, or just a movie you can watch again and again and just truly enjoy some outstanding performances by some truly gifted actors and an ensemble cast. Crazy Stupid Love is really great! 8/10",8,1,2,15 January 2012
Happy Gilmore," Sometimes I have to eat my words even when I don't want to
","I had not seen Happy Gilmore. People were shocked when I would say this but I also had zero desire to see it and the more time that passed, the less I wanted to see it. It seemed like it was in that vein of comedy that I didn't care for at all. I don't hate Adam Sandler, but I hate when he does stupid so I lumped Happy Gilmore into that. My wife insisted we check it out when they added it to Netflix so we gave it a try. Not only was Happy Gilmore not terrible, it was actually quite funny and silly but in all the right ways and you can actually see Adam Sandler's charisma that has made him a comedy staple for the last couple of decades. This was far better than his fare as of late. I even was especially impressed with that infamous and ridiculous fight between Happy and Bob Barker. Someone told me just before I watched this that I had to because it was a staple of 90's cinema and I scoffed at them. Well I take back my scoff. For all it's ridiculousness, it is a quintessential 90's film and it's the perfect type of movie to just turn your brain off and have some fun.Sometimes its hard now to figure out why Adam Sandler is so successful. But when you go back and look at Happy Gilmore you see the type of guy that came out of Saturday Night Live with a ton of talent. Happy is a great character full of anger and uncontrollable outbursts and he's funny and commands attention. Its not an Award worthy performance, it's just a fun role. A good part of the success of the movie is the supporting cast. Christopher Mcdonald is absolutely perfect as the egotistical nemesis to Happy. McDonald is always good at these types of character roles and this is no exception. Julie Bowen (now known for Modern Family of course) is decent as the love interest. Her character is very one-dimensional but she does alright. She certainly doesn't flex any comedic muscles in the role. Frances Bay, another great character actor, is perfect as Happy's beloved Grandmother. Some other faces to watch for are Bob Barker (of course), Ben Stiller, Joe Flaherty, Richard Kiel and Allen Covert to name some of the stronger supporting roles.Director Dennis Dugan has had a very interesting career. He has done a lot of Television and a lot of silly comedy. Then he seems to have hitched his ride to Adam Sandler and hasn't looked back since. I don't know if Dugan feels comfortable in the genre or what but this was one of his better films with Sandler so I guess he deserves credit. I'm not sure he has much style, he just sort of uses his cast decently and tells his story. Happy Gilmore is a dirty adult comedy but it's also not toilet humour for no other sake so I can respect that. I laughed a lot and had a good time so I eat my words and I admit to Happy Gilmore's deserved legacy in 90's film history. 8/10",8,0,2,12 January 2016
The Notebook," A Timeless Love Story
","The Notebook seemed to do well and people seemed to enjoy it. I didn't realize it was as good as it turned out to be or I would have seen it much earlier. The Notebook is a beautiful, touching, love story, well acted and wonderfully directed by relative director newcomer Nick Cassavetes.The Notebook takes place during the depression era and throughout the forties. We are introduced to young, hard working, quiet, free spirited Noah. During a chance encounter and the carnival Noah falls in love with a rich débutante named Allie who is visiting the area for the summer with her wealthy parents. His charm and persistence eventually wins her over and the two fall deeply in love and have a passionate summer romance. A misunderstanding forces the young lovers apart for many years and Allie eventually falls in love with another man who is more to her social standards but the passion is not the same. Noah who goes to war, returns and builds his dream home as he always said he would. Once again fate brings the young lovers together and Allie is forced to choose between her first love and the man everyone believes she belongs with. All this is told through an elderly man reading to a woman suffering from senility.First of all, The Notebook is breathtaking. It captures the era is such a way that it draws you in and makes you fall in love with everything about it. It's the most romantic scenery set amongst less than romantic situations such as the depression and war. The story is paced perfectly and we genuinely feel this incomparable love between the two young lovers. That's the most important thing to establish for this story. The twist to the story, to me, was never much of a twist and in fact you'll pretty much know what's going on from the moment it starts but that really only adds to the romantic tone of this film. Canadian Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are steamy together and both play their roles perfectly. You feel each character's emotions and spirit and you feel for both of them. The supporting cast including the amazing James Garner and Gena Rowlands are amazing in their small but so important roles. Anyone looking for a romantic film must see this one!! I admit I didn't overly enjoy the final ending, I think it was a cop out and could have been handled different but it's still a beautiful amazing movie. Possibly the best romance movie I have ever seen. A must see!! 9/10",9,0,1,18 February 2005
Public Enemies," Historical? Not much. An amazing shoot em up gangster pic to entertain? Bullseye!!
","I wasn't sure how to take Public Enemies from trailers and from critics opinions. On the way hand was this a historical film about a real character and his life and death along the lines of a biography or was this simply an action flick, a Johnny Depp vehicle that simply pulls from history to make an entertaining mainstream movie that is meant to get your blood pumping. Public Enemies is absolutely the latter. So much is being said about the historical accuracy of the film and who cares? I didn't go see this film to learn the true story of John Dillinger, I went to be entertained and this film delivered on so many levels. The drama was heavy, the acting well performed and the shoot outs and action scenes were just incredible. The film also held nothing back from being a gritty and intensely violent film which means it holds it's own in the gangster/mob genre of films. Best of all no one character was held above the character of John Dillinger because he is the focus of the film. Also perhaps some or most of the film is not historically accurate but in reading a little bit about Dillinger and that time period some of it most definitely is including the bloody climax which was filmed in the actual location of Dillinger's death.Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors in Hollywood from Willy Wonka, to Captain Jack and now to John Dillinger. His suave appearance and screen charisma is perfect for this role. He carries the film with his usual ease and makes the character come to life in brilliant clarity. Award worthy perhaps? A real surprise in this film was the ever present Christian Bale who I am not an enormous fan of. Bale is not only tolerable but he is not overused and actually gives a good solid performance as Melvin Purvis, Dillinger's number one pursuer. I thought for sure Bale would try his utmost to outshine Depp and they would fight for screen time and ego but Bale takes a back seat with ease and turns in a solid supporting role! And he barely growls which automatically gives him points. There is a large and significant supporting cast including Channing Tatum in a decent role as Pretty Boy Floyd and who also gets the opportunity to star in one of the best death scenes I've ever seen in movies. However, no one person from the supporting cast stands out above the two Hollywood heavyweights Bale and Depp.Director Michael Mann needed this film for my books because after what was hands down one of the worst films I've ever seen Miami Vice he needed redemption and this was definitely it. Mann is one of those directors that thinks he has this ultimate artistic style and he has to make everything with this sporadic and chaotic filming and fortunately he played that down for Public Enemies to give the film the proper 1930's feel. Although certainly he got his style during the gun battles. Sometimes the style works and sometimes it doesn't. He tells a great story and no matter what one thinks of Michael Mann he knows gritty and it works for this movie to the max. Action, suspense, romance, history, gun fights and mobsters...if any of these things appeal to you then you must see this movie. I didn't know what to expect and you might not either but you will be blown away. This is one summer blockbuster that was a genuine and welcome surprise. 9/10",9,5,10,23 August 2009
The Babadook," A very honest effort for an indie film
","My reason for watching this so quickly was it kept showing up on the best of 2014 Lists of various reviewers so I quickly became intrigued. Indie horror films can be huge hits or huge misses and I've seen plenty of both because I love the genre. People were saying this was the most terrifying film since the original Ringu film (one of the truly scary films ever made.) They aren't wrong. The Babadook's concept is nearly brilliant and some of the scenes are downright terrifying. They utilize their moderate budget to the best of their ability. You desperately want to see the mysterious Babadook but they brilliantly keep him mostly a mystery. Using the book and the cartoon on the TV definitely sends shivers up your spine. So all that works very well. Now one of their fatal fatal flaws is in casting. Nearly the entire film is a two person show so they need two very strong actors to carry this film. They completely missed the boat in casting the young child actor. But I'll get to that in a moment. The emotional intensity of this film is very high but they take it almost too far because it almost broaches on campy in certain scenes. The film is dark and dreary and harsh and that works so well so when you border on campy, it takes you away from it.So I will start with the little boy that couldn't. Hopefully he never reads this because I would hate to upset him but he literally probably made a 9/10 film a solid 7 with just his performance. Newcomer Noah Wiseman is atrocious. He gets slightly better farther into the film but in the beginning he is insanely irritating, obnoxious and literally he comes across as handicapped in some way. If I were the mother of that child I would have gladly fed him to the Babadook. I don't understand why they made him so irritating. He's awful. I suppose if that's what they were going for than Wiseman nails it. But it ruins the movie period. Essie Davis who has a lot of experience is very, very good as the weary mother who is gradually possessed by the Babadook. Her breakdown is perfectly done and she is very good at looking terrified and broken. Some truly outrageous and terrifying things happen to her and she plays the scream queen role very well. I would love to see her return in a sequel if they ditch Wiseman. The relationship between them improves and he gets better and way less annoying in the end of the film but the damage is done.The best thing about The Babadook is the writing and the setting. Jennifer Kent who writes and directs the film is mostly known for acting but she absolutely has some talent behind the camera. Instead of the film making you notice how little they change locations or how they hide things in the shadows, it feels like that is what you want out of this. Their home is very claustrophobic and the shots are tight on their face and it just makes you feel like you can't breath and it works very well for the movie. I think if you sit down, turn out all the lights and just let yourself be immersed in the film you can ignore Wiseman's performance enough to get truly creeped out and that is the goal of this type of movie especially for an indie film. 7/10",7,5,11,11 January 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," Brilliantly performances in a riveting story whether fiction or otherwise
","It seems like as of late if you decide to make a historical film or period piece you better have time traveled back and triple checked your facts. It seems to me that so many reviewers and movie goers are forgetting the key element to the movies...to have fun...to be entertained. Sure some films can do other things for us but this is still the key to Hollywood. I know little to nothing about the true history of Anne Boleyn, although after seeing the film it did encourage me to read into it which makes the film worthwhile in the first place. The story that they create is captivating and truly riveting. I found myself just enthralled by the story and the characters. It's not fast moving or full of action and yet I just couldn't stop watching and I wanted to know where everything was going. Director Justin Chadwick seems to be relatively new to the big screen direction process and yet he knew exactly how to deliver the story and what was or was not important. Granted he had the incredible opportunity of 2 HUGE Hollywood starlets but even still he had a story to tell and get the most out of it and he succeeds in a big way. You aren't overwhelmed by the time of the film, completely drowned with beautiful flourishing dresses and castles a la Marie Antoinette (see my review but not the movie) but rather gives you a little of that and a lot of story and character.There are some truly fantastic performances in this film. Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worth performance as the twisted and disturbed Anne Boleyn. Her character goes through something of a transformation and yet you see her twisted personality shine through a little right from the beginning. Her character and her performance is the best I've seen this year!! Scarlett Johansson proves she is more than her looks with her very impressive performance as the more tender hearted and eventually scorned sister Mary Boleyn. Her performance is not on par with Portman's but she does very well nonetheless. The two of them have great chemistry together and do an amazing job carrying the film. Eric Bana...how can the guy who brought The Hulk be rewarded by being in a film with Portman and Johansson? And they are both his love interests? I am kidding of course. Bana is actually very good as the torn and decent but love struck King Henry. He's also rugged and sexy for the women and probably nothing like the real King Henry but has electric chemistry with Johansson and his obvious infatuation with Portman's Anne Boleyn is perfect. Jim Sturgess makes a small appearance as Portman and Johansson's brother, Kristin Scott Thomas and Mark Rylance are excellent as the Boleyn parents, and David Morrissey is brilliant as the evil Duke of Norfolk who wants nothing more than to further his family name.I am a history fan and a student of history and I don't give a lick how much this film is historically accurate. Some of it is likely lifted from history and some of it is added for dramatic element and to ENTERTAIN!! I have no doubt, as I mentioned, that King Henry Tudor was rugged and built like a Greek god nor that the Boleyn girls looked hot and sexy like the cover of a magazine or that The Duke of Norfolk had evil villain music playing behind him at all times. The movie was meant to entertain and it does that with a twisted tale of romance and deception to the highest ranks that nearly brings down an empire. If anything it will inspire you to read more of the true story which is even better. For a period time piece such as this you will want to check it out because the performances alone are stunning, especially Portman and the story will keep you riveted right to your seat. It's not often you get truly great stories like this early in the year so definitely check it out because I loved it!! 9/10",9,4,7,18 March 2008
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," High flying summer adventure that actually keeps the game in tact AND entertains
","Obviously the transition between gaming and movies is a tumultuous relationship. Successes like Resident Evil and failures like Doom are prominent everywhere and I've often wondered how they manage to screw it up really. I mean video games are like books in many ways and the transition to big screen should nine times out of ten be brilliant. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time proves that this transition can be executed with brilliant adventure, characters, romance, and still keep elements of the game that makes fanboys swoon. As the film began I was a little worried. It sort of drags in the beginning and even seems a little campy which doesn't bode well for a 'summer blockbuster.' But my concerns were soon put to rest as the story takes hold and the action begins. Obvious comparisons to Pirates of the Caribbean are worthy given the film is produced by Disney and has very similar adventure plots and directing style. The story is a solid fantasy tale and the lead characters are both very strong in their own right and carries you through the whole film. It is said that the director didn't want any action sequences that looked cheesy just because they were in the game but he still kept some really great game like moments that didn't stick out on screen as being bad.Jake Gyllenhaal takes on the lead role as the Prince himself and does a really solid job. He obviously takes the role seriously and puts a lot of effort into it. He looks the part, and pulls off the stunts flawlessly. Bond girl Gemma Arterton plays sassy, strong Tamina. She isn't really likable at first but I don't think she is supposed to be. Her and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry BUT not great chemistry which is the one place the film stumbles. Still both of them separately make really amazing action stars. Ben Kingsley plays a subtle but ominous role as brother to the King, Nizam. Kingsley doesn't have a lot of lines or moments in the film and yet still plays a really solid role in the film and is always great in a cast. Supporting cast that don't have significant depth but still really do honestly add something to the cast include Alfred Molina, Steve Toussaint, Toby Kebbell, and Ronald Pickup.If anyone would be right for a film like this director Mike Newell would be perfect. He is becoming an expert on fantasy adventure and absolutely tells a great story. Best of all he did manage to respect gamers and the original concept by keeping enough of that original idea in tact without forcing down anyone's throat. If you watched the film without any previous knowledge where it came from you would have no idea it was based on a video game and yet if you're a fan of the game series and watch the film then you'll be pleasantly surprised with how much of the film is connected to the game. I agree with several reviewers that were surprised how low this film scores on IMDb because I think it holds itself at least on par with entries in the Pirates series and holds its own as a terrific summer action flick. Well worth your time and money!! 8.5/10",8,0,1,20 July 2010
Ted," For all the insane hype...I really thought I'd like it...
","I'm not a huge fan of comedies, I'm even less of a fan of dirty raunchy comedies and not because I'm offended easily, you couldn't offend me if you tried...they just aren't funny. As an adult I am not amused by fart jokes and yelling body parts to get a laugh. However, that being said...I really looked forward to Ted. I know it would be raunchy and dirty but I thought Seth MacFarlane might bring a certain level of intelligence to the silly comedy genre like he does with Family Guy. I was sorely disappointed. Ted spends more than half of it's run time being outrageous stupid Adam Sandler-esque humour that resorts to the most juvenile of sex jokes and drugs. Half way through I thought I would be scoring this a 2 if it was lucky. However, surprisingly so the film does turn itself around slightly in the latter half. I really thought Ted would have a good story to go with the raunchy comedy but the good story doesn't really start until more than three quarters of the way through the movie. I also give the film kudos for the insane amount of 80's media nods from music to film to Television because that is a lot of fun for anyone who loved the 80's.The cast is almost surprisingly good considering how bad most of the script is. Mark Wahlberg continues to prove his diversity as pot smoking, life struggling, and often lazy John. He has an undeniable chemistry on screen and the banter with Ted is really amusing sometimes. Mila Kunis plays her role well although it's a simple enough role. Her and Wahlberg have good chemistry and her character is a little basic but she does well. Seth Macfarlane is our Ted. Obviously the guy is a multi-talented comedian and can do MANY voices. I am a little confused why he chose Ted's voice to be one and the same with Peter Griffin though they do make fun of that at one point which was amusing. Still you can't doubt Macfarlane's comedic talent as Ted's voice. He nails it. The supporting cast includes Joel McHale (why does he always play a sleaze-bag in comedies?) and a skeezy and perfectly villainous Giovanni Ribisi. The cast all work well together and probably pull the awful script out of being completely lost.I suppose I wanted Ted to be nasty and dirty but also have some heart. And in the end it tries to do that but its way too late. It relies far too heavily on really juvenile jokes that don't really work. It jumps from shocking jokes about racism to sex and I did laugh, I even hazard to say I laughed a lot but it meant nothing because the film leaves you feeling very empty. This film got really hyped up by so many people and I heard nothing but how amazing and hilarious it was so I'm sure my expectations were probably high going into it but the film remains a sub par effort in the dirty comedy genre. 5/10",5,2,3,12 December 2012
127 Hours," Marred by 'uniqueness' that is almost a little too odd for the type of film that it is
","You couldn't turn the channel without hearing something about 127 Hours and the story behind it when it first came out. The story was captivating and I thought a film that bordered on a disaster movie, a survival film, a man overcoming the worst of odds and cheating death would be incredible and if anyone could pull a roll off like that it would be James Franco. But I digress for a moment. I finally got in to see the film and I think I felt just a little bit disappointed. The film is not bad by any means. His survival story is fantastic. I think by the time I saw the film the hype was so big around it that I could only be slightly disappointed by it. I actually blame my disappointment squarely on the shoulders of the director. I felt like his overblown ego which we have seen before especially following the run away success that I never understood of another critically hyped film of his Slumdog Millionaire, was in full swing. He had to make his own unique flare to the story and it ended up being like a music video, choppy and obscure and I do understand that the film's pace and style is a reflection of the main characters sanity but I think it went just a little too far.James Franco is probably one of the hardest working, most versatile guys in the movie business. He's a leading man, he's a supporting actor, he does TV, film and anything he can get his hands on. He clearly loves his craft. He is the perfect fit for the role of Aron Ralston. He has this down to earth, guy next door quality that endears him to you and then to see him in that horrifying situation essentially losing his mind is heart breaking and nerve wracking and that is great for the film. This is very nearly a one man show. I suppose that is part of the reason they added the significant beginning to the film where Ralston meets two women hiking and befriends them. Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara play those women. I can't really say a lot about their performance as it is a very small role and they fulfil the part nicely. Tamblyn is a welcome face also from TV and film. The other reason for the rather extensive opening scene of him befriending the women is that we can get to know Ralston better outside of his horrifying situation so we can see just how nice and down to earth this guy is.This might sound morbid and maybe I need to watch the film again but the whole build up for this film is to where Ralston ultimately cuts off his own arm with a pocket knife to escape certain death. When they finally got to that scene I felt like it was a bit of a let down compared to the build up. I mean its still intense but the journey is what makes it intense not the outcome. Of course no one has seen Ralston's real video footage except for Ralston, his family, director and co-writer Danny Boyle and James Franco apparently. Maybe I'm wrong about the directing style seeming flippant and jumpy, maybe that is the true story. I do believe Boyle tried very hard to capture Ralston as close to true life as possible. 127 Hours is a gripping drama at times but I think I became a victim over over hyped word of mouth on this one. While I found it interesting at times, I also found it to be a little over-intensified and less entertaining. Check it out for yourself and see another amazing James Franco performance. 7/10",7,0,0,17 August 2011
Pirate Radio," A fun FICTIONAL movie about the sixties and not much else
","While Pirate Radio calls itself 'based on a true story' the fact is that it is very loosely based on a host of Radio Stations that ran under the radar in the sixties and the film makers decided to make a fictional film around that concept so all the reviewers, professionally and otherwise, who cry historical inaccuracies really need to learn to enjoy their favourite medium a little more. Pirate Radio isn't trying to be the next Academy Award winning film (I hope) because in that vein it does not succeed. It is a light and fluffy film about that old saying 'Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll' and its meant to be fun, spirited and rebellious. All of that is firmly in check. Does it take it beyond that to really impress? No not really and perhaps that is where it stumbles. Some really terrific actors, some great music, and the fun that was the sixties. The story might even seem a little over the top and implausible but then I don't know any of the true stories of the radio rock stations this is based on.Brilliant actor Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the boisterous lovable shock jock 'The Count' and is as charismatic as always. None of the main characters really get a big back story but this is all about the radio station and the music. Hoffman is always a welcome addition to any cast and is perfect. Tom Sturridge plays the young man who is sent to live aboard the boat. In some ways this could be a coming of age story for him but they never really explore that. Instead sadly Sturridge is reduced to being wide eyed and plain and rather boring overall throughout the film. Bill Nighy is also a terrific actor who is a pleasure to see on screen and he is cool as anything in his role but only gets small screen time so doesn't leave a last mark. Nick Frost gets perhaps one of most flamboyant roles of the film as the over the top DJ Dr. Dave who is a sex crazed loud guy. He's sort of lovable and a scum bag all at once and is fun to watch. The rest of the cast all have their role to play and they are decent but they get even less screen time or depth to their characters so they unfortunately fall to the wayside.A bit of a legendary English writer having penned for dozens of famous English Television programs. However his directing experience is limited, this being only his second big film. His first film Love Actually was very well received and I have never seen it but the problem is that Pirate Radio misses the boat on character development and leaves it all in the hands of the rock and roll. That doesn't make the film bad, in fact the film is very entertaining, will leave you smiling and has a climatic ending that will leave you feeling good and laughing. 7/10",7,2,3,12 July 2010
"I Love You, Man"," Plainly stated...it's just funny...and that's good with me
","The Judd Apatow/Will Ferrell comedy troupe have niched their own genre in Hollywood. The bad thing is if you don't like any of their troupe you'll have trouble watching any of their films because they have a habit of constantly showing up in each others films but the good news is you can practically expect exactly what the film will provide and it is almost always entertaining in a simple silly fun way. I Love You, Man is exactly that. It won't wow you, it has no deep important, thoughtful message, it funny and silly and gross and the characters are funny and lovable. The movie isn't without its flaws but it will make you laugh and laugh and is just really a good time and there is nothing wrong with that whatsoever. The movie has plenty of slapstick one liners, some great physical comedy and some hilarious cameos that really up the ante of this film.Paul Rudd has truly come a long way in his comedic career. He has a really great subtle style and can pull off some great comedy both physical and verbal style. I Love You, Man is the perfect outlet and vehicle for him to shine away from the Apatow/Ferrell troupe. He is terrific and likable and a sweet guy who becomes unhinged from his stuffy ways which makes for really great laughs! Rudd will become a great star beyond that of his team. Jason Segel plays Rudd's new best friend and polar opposite. He's carefree, crazy and a little wild and Rudd finds something in him to connect with. Segel is decent, he's getting to a place where he can actually perform a decent character and not just be silly and stupid but this role only helps him a little because he still has that style. Segel and Rudd have decent chemistry although a little more would be nice. Rudd definitely outshines Segel but they are good together. The supporting cast are really terrific both bigger and smaller roles. Jon Favreau and Jaime Pressly are hilarious as an at odds married couple. They really are great opposite each other and probably have the best chemistry in the film. Jane Curtin, J.K. Simmons, and Andy Samberg are terrific in small cameos as Rudd's family. Rashida Jones is okay as Rudd's fiancé, compared to everyone else in the film she comes across as very bland. Finally you can't forget the terrific, hilarious cameo by Lou Ferrigno. The cast work well together, some of them come together better than others but they still provide a solid cast and loads of laughs.A good comedy is a gem to find because it can make you laugh, and if it's really worthwhile you'll watch it again and again. There is absolutely no doubt that I Love You, Man has some truly classic moments. John Hamburg hasn't exactly had some really big director gigs but even so he seems to handle this mainstream decently budgeted comedy with ease and tells a good solid story. I Love You, Man is the perfect time waster and I mean that very positively. It will make you laugh to tears at times and while it won't change your life but it will make you glad you watched it. 8/10",8,0,2,19 May 2009
Superbad," Dirty, vulgar, inappropriate...and also pretty darn funny
","I won't rave about Superbad. I honestly didn't feel like it had the clever dirty wit of 'Knocked Up' or even '40 Year Old Virgin' and yet it had a certain charm and there was NO doubt that everyone I watched this with in the theater thought it was downright hilarious. For me it wasn't quite that funny but it certainly had it's high points. I felt like maybe director Greg Mottola and creators/writers Seth Rogan, and Evan Goldberg maybe tried a little too hard to create something they had hoped would be a classic teen sex romp comedy and I guess they did just fine since that's exactly what most are saying it is and will be. Most are even comparing it to the original American Pie which I think is true honor. The unknown cast was a great idea and they do a terrific job, and the film certainly has some memorable enough moments. A lot of the things that others seem to find so hilariously funny seemed to me to be a little recycled and seen before type comedy but there was also a lot of very funny physical comedy and one liners and probably a lot of realistic teenage moments as well. One of the most clever and endearing parts of this film is the way that it is presented. It would appear as though the film takes place in the seventies with music, and the opening scene disco dancing against flashing colors and the cars and some of the clothing but it is a modern day film where they carry cell phones and visit malls and it kind of makes the film sort of timeless and baby boomers and teenagers today can enjoy the same.The cast is headed by two basically newcomers. Jonah Hill is the portly, wild haired youngster playing Seth and he is damn hilarious. He is dirty mouthed, wild eyed and horny and his one liners and sarcasm is just awesome. He also does some really terrific physical comedy getting hit by a car twice, hit with a bat, beat up and more!! Hill is sure to be a star and his career will get jumpstarted with this film. His co-star and conspirator in the film is Michael Cera. Although he has had a varied career this is really his first starring role. He has a much more pure and innocent nice guy role than Hill's wild character. Still they have awesome chemistry together and they balance each other nicely. Both of them will fare well in the future. I hope they team up again. Making his movie debut as the third muskateer is Christopher Mintz-Plasse as the hilariously geeky Fogell or better known as the infamous 'McLovin.' Even though he plays the stereotypical thick glasses 'geek' he actually turns out to be the coolest dude in the movie and he has a great role and plays off his co-stars very well. He could hold his own film as McLovin. Rounding out the cast as the hilariously inappropriate and over the top cops Slater and Michaels are co-writer Seth Rogan and the hilariously bizarre Bill Hader. They're the cops from hell but they keep the hilarity rolling and together with 'McLovin' (Mintz-Plasse) they are an amazing comedy trio. They just might be the highlight of the film.This film will never impress too many critics or audiences if you go into it thinking this will be deep or important in ANY way. The film is incredibly shallow and only redeems itself as a complete (and very funny) joke in the end. It never tries to be emotional or important or even show any sort of moral. It's just a raunchy adventure to try and get booze for an underage party so they can get laid or so they think. The language is extreme, there is drug use and booze everywhere but it still manages to be a funny, well written comedy that will likely move into it's place with Animal House, and American Pie which is no small feat. If you can go into a movie and put your brain aside and not be offended than you'll see this cute little dirty movie for what it is. 7/10",7,1,4,7 September 2007
Creed," ...Wow...
","It is a little tough for me to write this review impartially. Sylvester Stallone is a personal hero of mine for a number of reasons and my favourite actor period. So it is safe to say my expectations were through the roof on this one but just seeing him on the big screen scores points. However, even with that, Creed is a fantastic piece of work. The entire Rocky legacy has gone from critical hit to mainstream, to less respected and is now inching its way back...life imitating art so to speak. Creed is a near perfect 'reboot.' I HATE that new expression that has become so common place. Reboot is just a word for trying to make a franchise better enough that it continues. Creed is almost a blend of a reboot and a remake as it does mirror much of the original classic Rocky film but not enough to make it so obvious that it reeks of being yet another Rocky. If I could call out one flaw to the film it would be that there is too much here for one movie. They really cram a lot of story and a lot of time into one two hour film. Still, it works on an incredibly entertaining level and as another IMDb reviewer pointed out, this is a miraculous ode to fans of Rocky.I have never been sure about Michael B. Jordan. You hear a lot of him being an up and comer but then he was in a dud (Fantastic Four) and he was good in the much talked about Fruitvale Station but that was a sub par movie in my books. I wasn't sure I would be impressed with him in this. Well I was...Jordan delivers. He is tough and real and an underdog that you can invest in and while the pacing of the film is a little off as far as how he rises the ranks and become who he is, his performance is full of emotion and fear and aggression and above all strength. He isn't Rocky and he isn't Stallone but he definitely commands attention. One of the smartest things Creed does is it puts Rocky Balboa secondary to Adonis and it truly does! However, for those of us who are enormous Rocky fans, it is a terrific follow up to his story as well. Best of all, this is Stallone's best performance in decades. I know a lot of people poke fun of him but I think he's an excellent actor and Creed proves that because Rocky is Rocky. He becomes a different person. He carries himself differently, he has a different lingo in his voice, he carries emotion from losing his wife and his best friend and his laid back demeanour. If you watch Stallone become Rocky again...you'll just be floored by his performance. Best of all, he has perfect chemistry with Jordan and they are believable and so good together. Tessa Thompson is...good in her role. I don't want to say anything bad about her because she is good but she is the 'must include' romantic interest and she does need to be there but its another thing they have to establish and build and she has her own little back story. I suppose they could expand on her in future instalments but she felt a little 'in the way.' Phylicia Rashad is perfect (and looks fantastic!) as Mary Anne Creed. The only thing I can say is that I would have loved to have more of her and hopefully she returns for sequels. One thing about the Rocky franchise is they always established the enemy very well. They created a larger than life persona for Rocky to go up against. Creed does that to a lesser extent but nonetheless Tony Bellew is a fantastic nemesis. He is frighteningly huge, they establish his violent temperament and he is great in the ring. Maybe I'm too hooked up the mainstream concept of Rocky and the training montages of yesteryear.This is an example of an enormous fan creating something straight from the heart. Ryan Coogler is now a 'one-to-watch' director and for pretty good reason. He definitely has style and vision but most of all...this guy has heart. The Rocky franchise was near and dear to him and something he shared with his Dad and Creed reeks of how much he loves these characters. He lets Rocky shine, he lets Adonis come to life and he makes this an entirely new ballgame. Please, please don't let him go producers! Keep him involved in this newly built Universe. While Creed isn't perfect, it is very nearly...and for what is technically the seventh instalment of a franchise for it to be going back to its roots and truly rebooting properly is a terrific feat. I can't wait to add this to my Stallone collection. This will likely end up on my top ten of 2015 list!! 9/10",9,2,5,8 December 2015
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," The absolutely perfect spin off with the perfect character to do it with!!
","The Xmen films literally set a standard for Marvel superhero films and launched an epic array of the Marvel Universe characters some better than others but none, in my humble opinion, as good as, or as thoroughly created, or more brilliantly casted than X-Men. The top of that pile was Hugh Jackman who anyone would be convinced the character of Logan 'Wolverine' was based off of and not the other way around. Jackman IS Wolverine and created one of the best heroes of recent years. It only made sense to give the X-Men character with the most complex, mysterious story line a terrific spin off to answer all or most of our questions and bring back the most kick butt member of the team while mixing in some of the other Marvel Universe characters. Right from the beginning the film just hooks you in with a very cool montage of various wars that Wolverine/Logan fought in with his close friend Victor Creed. But all falls apart when the rogue mercenary team goes too far and drives Logan away. The plot is perfect and has an amazing pace, and still manages to deliver incredible action sequences, fights, and Wolverine kicking serious butt even more and better than he did with X-Men. If by a third entry a character is usually reaching it's climax they proved they can rise away from that and made him even better than he was by the third installment of his original trilogy.As stated before Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. He made this character so real to fans of comic and film alike that no one could ever replace him. Best of all Jackman is a terrific actor so he delivers a great performance with depth and mystery and looks great doing it. He is amazing simply put. Liev Schreiber bursts onto the screen as Victor Creed otherwise and gradually known as Sabretooth. Schreiber has had decent roles in the past but he really nails this role and fits into the character flawlessly. Best of all Schreiber and Jackman have great chemistry so the story of their friendship and rivalry plays out perfectly. If they continue this worthwhile franchise Schreiber should be the only choice to return as Sabretooth. Character actor Danny Huston is a great villain of sorts as Logan's former mentor who plays such a huge role in Wolverine's existence as we quickly learn. I didn't think they used Huston or his character as much as they could have. The supporting cast were all so terrific that they have so much more to build on that they could milk this for YEARS!! Dominic Monaghan, Daniel Henney, Ryan Reynolds (very underused as Deadeye...so much more to be done with him) and a quick cameo by a young Scott Summers (Cyclops) played by Tim Pocock. I leave the performance by Taylor Kitsch to last as he brought my favorite X-Men to life finally...Gambit. He was terrific and nailed the role and yet was sadly underused!! He could support his own film and I think Kitsch could do it! The fact that many of the characters were 'underused' in my opinions is NOT the fault of the film makers. In fact quite the opposite. This film was about exactly what it was meant to be Wolverine and his origins, the fact that his path crossed with all these amazing characters was not bogged down by their own individual stories and perhaps it leaves the perfect entries to future installments of X-Men, or Wolverine, or any other character films without being repetitive or boring. Character actor himself, but fairly new director Gavin Hood obviously has a lot of talent in telling a story and he must be a comic lover because he nails these characters down. The action is intense, the story is amazing and it was one of the best action films of the summer and got it started to a phenomenal start. 9/10",9,3,7,23 August 2009
Alexander," Unremarkable potential...added comments about directors cut
","I will begin by saying that I have been a fan of Alexander the Great since my early teens. For the better part of a decade he has been my ancient history hero. I have read many books, seen every documentary and I had an incredible teacher walk me step by step through his incredible life. So knowing that I entered into 'Alexander.' The film is the story of the Great Macedonian Conqueror and leader Alexander. Son of King Phillip and rumored to be the son of a God. The film walks us through early stories of his childhood, his friends, and the major events that turned him into a man. Early scenes focus on his father played quite well, and remarkably unrecognizable by Val Kilmer. The film than jumps to Alexander's later years although he only lived to be 33. We see his first amazing battle against Darius, King of The Persians which in essence was his first and greatest victory opening gateways to the Eastern world and eventually his entire takeover of the known world. Throughout the movie we see major events that shaped him, changed him, hurt him, and made him stronger and eventually leading to his untimely death. Every character you would expect to be in the film is there, his mother Olympias, he closest dearest friend Hephastian, Ptolemy, Darius, Aristotle.The film really had so much to live up to in my expectations which makes it a difficult movie for me to watch. This film was one of my most anticipated of all times. However I do not believe I am being harsh on it because of that. I truly believe there were horrible mistakes made. However I also disagree on many fronts with the issues had by many other people watching this film. I do believe Colin Farrell had his best role in Alexander. His dialect was dry, and speeches unappealing but I don't chock that up to him whatsoever. His performance as Alexander was moving and dead on and I have never seen him in a more passionate role. I did buy Angelina Jolie as his mother because Olympias was rumored to be a conniving, evil woman who toyed with Alexander's emotions and was a twisted, young woman. Jolie plays twisted quite well. Kilmer was excellent as the overbearing, abusive, King. The cast was not the issue. The script played a heavy part on this film and the script and direction quite honestly sucked!! It hurts me to say that being Oliver Stone has delivered some of the most passionate and honest, politically incorrect films (that's a good thing) we've ever seen. JFK, NIXON, Platoon etc. Alexander had Stone's style, he held no punches and he battles the Homosexuality rumors head on, and in his perfect style leaves Alexander's death a complete mystery with a line of suspects and ways that he could have died...broken heart, assassination, disease. One of the biggest misfortunes of this film was the battles...oh I mean BATTLE..single....perhaps one and a half. You cannot do a grand Epic least of all about Alexander and not have each of his amazing battles and how he won them. Instead Stone recreated brilliantly mind you with all the goriness his one great battle. The rest of the film dragged and left certain aspects to the imagination. It's a disappointing film and Stone is unfortunately to blame for poor writing, and poor directing. The film does capture the essence of the Greek culture of the time and perhaps does capture the emotion of Alexander without ever showing his accomplishments. I understand why this film is bombing and I don't recommend it to anyone who isn't just a big history fan. 5/10**************New comments after seeing Alexander: Directors Cut***** I don't know if it was the additions and changes that director Oliver Stone hesitantly made to the DVD release of Alexander but it felt to be different in my second viewing. I still stand by the fact that the film has awesome potential that was left untapped. It's very true that some of the acting in the film was severely over-acted, campy even which for a big budget (HUGE) Historical Epic is rather out of place but I think everyone did what they could. I do think another actor could have grabbed onto the role of the young King Alexander better than Farrell did. I don't know if he has the acting ability to pull of this role but he does try damn hard!!! Unfortunately it does come off as a bit campy at times. I still stand by the fact that Val Kilmer's portrayal as King Phillip is brilliant!!! Razzies aside (I hate those awards!!) I give Alexander (directors cut at least) a bump in ratings because it's still very slow paced and the action is few and far between but I think it will become a classic and history buffs will enjoy it. I would just like to have seen a better time line, I don't think it was necessary to have flashbacks and it would have made the film fit together if everything was in chronological order. More battles were an absolute must. The two battles in the film were so brilliantly done than even one more in the middle would have been welcomed. This was the greatest general in history!! And I think Stone's attempt at being controversial was overused in the constant reference to Alexander's sexuality. It was good that he brought it up, but it was overused intensely!! I think in the directors cut too that they made it seem more suspicious that Alexander's death was the work of his own men and I thought the ending was better originally. Check it out for yourself!! It's not as bad as one might think. 6.5/10",6,1,2,9 December 2004
Constantine," Intelligentally created comic book action adventure!!
","There will always be the typical arguments about this film. Some will adore it, some will hate it and complain about it to no end. Fact remains that it pulled in hundreds of millions at the box office. Does that make it good?? No. It just makes it popular hence all the difference in opinions. I have never read the Hellblazers comic books so I went into this with no expectations and was pleasantly blown away by it.Keanu Reeve's acting ability is limited, that's no secret but nonetheless there are some roles that have him stamped all over it such as Neo in the Matrix series, or any brooding, quiet type action hero and the lead role of John Constantine seems to fit him like a glove. Constantine appears to be your typical action horror film and not hard to create but the real genius behind Constantine that sets it apart from all the rest if that it actually becomes a very intelligent, complex thriller filled with religious overtones and an interesting plot line. I can't disagree more with some IMDb critics who called the plot 'flat' and Constantine's character underdeveloped. I thought the writers of the film (also writers of the comic) did an amazing job of creating these characters in one film. They perhaps gave us too much if they're hoping to turn this into a franchise. Reeves' Constantine is a dark lonely sort who has struggled with his ability to see demons since he was a child. His inner turmoil and emotionally repressed state comes through in a major way. He has very few close friends, family so to speak and one by one in this film they are killed off. They were great characters and I was sad to see each one go because they had so much more potential but it was necessary for us to see the life which Constantine lives. Rachel Weisz as the lead actress and somewhat romantic interest does a great job. Weisz is very versatile and interesting actress and is easy to watch. She seems to take any role with ease. Reeves and her have great chemistry and they work well together on screen.Francis Lawrence who, up until now, has been known only for music videos does an amazing job as his directorial debut. The special effects were NOT cheesy as some critics will say but rather subtly used which is much nicer change. The film was not flagrantly full of CGI and annoying fake effects. The action was non stop and on top of that comes an incredible story. The religious aspects however fictional they may be are interesting and we are given more and more information as we go along and you can't help but be caught up in this spiritual battle on earth between Constantine and the half breeds (half demon, half human.) On top of that there are several scenes where we get a glimpse into hell which is kept so brief that it keeps us wondering and imagining the horrors. The appearance near the end of Satan at first seems very tacked on and he's not very impressive. However as he continues in his role (played by character actor Peter Stormare) you begin to feel an evil there, something held back, something within. You begin to see that this calm facade is only burying something more and I hope in the future they bring him back for more. There is history to be discussed between Satan and Constantine. Overall I don't think there is much better for an intelligent, offbeat action film out there. I would see this again and again and I hope for Franchise status although I don't think any will be as good as this original. The Constantine character and film is brilliantly done with loads of promise for future stories. Check this one out for action fans. 9/10",9,2,5,19 August 2005
Troy," Hollywoodized Epic Tale!!
","Having been a great fan of Greek History, and Ancient History in general it was with great anticipation that I watched Troy. I was by no means disappointed and no one else should be either. This is not a historically accurate, perfectly depicted retelling of Homer's amazing historical tale of Troy and Achilles but rather an Epic, beautiful story made to impress with the highest dollar to rake in the box office dough. Sure the aspects of history are there but they were aiming to tell a story and Hollywoodize with beautiful faces, amazing battle scenes and an unlimited budget. Although I don't believe Troy cleaned up at the Box Office it has everything in place to be a blockbuster. Having recently seen Alexander, a very historically drawn out, slow film not made to impress but rather be as accurate and controversial as possible I know these are two extremes and it seems as though movie goes are too fickle to enjoy either one. Alexander was 'boring' 'slow' and 'too realistic' and Troy was 'glorified too much' and 'big name actors ruined it.' There seems to be no pleasing movie goers for the Greek films. Troy is the story of Sparta and the impending peace they are making with their long time enemy Troy. A Greek city of amazing military power, culture and knowledge. The sons of The King of Sparta, Hector and Paris are in Sparta to affirm the peace treaty. Unfortunately Paris is madly in love with, and having a passionate affair with Helen, the King of Sparta's sister in law. Paris convinces Helen to return to Troy with him envoking the wrath of her husband upon them who then turns to his brother the King to wage the largest scale war ever known to man on Troy. Sparta enlists the help of Greece's greatest hero, a man said to be immortal and son of the Gods Achilles played by Brad Pitt. Although Achillees feels no ties to the Spartan King, for the sake of glory and power he goes to Troy to help wage the battle. Pitt as the lead character and the immortal hero Achilles does a great job of being a leading Hollywood man. He won't walk away with any Oscars for this role nor should he and it's far from his greatest performance but it's good and he does what he was meant to do for this film. He's cocky, and vain, and conceited and has the look of a man who believes he is immortal. He womanizes, falls in love, and is a bloody ruthless killer all in one swoop and pulls it off flawlessly. Pitt is a great actor but he also fills the shoes of the film maker who wants a sexy leading man. Eric Bana is perfect also as the hero of the other side Hector who leads his men with valiant, and strong character. Orlando Bloom continues his epic roles coming out of Lord Of The Rings series and Pirates of The Caribbean to play a much more modest and meek character but a handsome lover in Paris. Bloom must really be an expert bowman as he gets to flex his bow and arrow yet again in this film. Diane Kruger who was also good in National Treasure this year makes another decent performance as the especially lovely Helen in which this war is started over. Brian Cox also adds a flair as Aggamemnon the king to Sparta. He makes an excellent villain of sorts and a believable King. One of the highlights in the film that really does add the true acting flair to this film is Peter O'Tooles roles as King Priam of Troy. You can't doubt O'Tooles acting credibility who has been around for decades and certainly knows a thing or two about Historical Epics. He adds an emotional and wonderful performance to the film.The Battle scenes and cinematography showing Troy and Ancient Greece and the scenes at the end with The Trojan Horse as brilliantly filmed by Wolfgang Peterson who has done some of my favorite action films. He knows how to make a blockbuster. The battle scenes are gory and well shot and there are plenty of them in this film something Alexander sadly lacked. All in all I don't think this movie disappoints. It may not show historically what everyone wants and it may stray far from Homer's Illyiad in it's story and certain facts but there is nothing wrong with basing something but not following it exactly. That gives us the opportunity to be pleasantly surprised. I would only suggest that more of a focus on Helen and Paris who really were the cause of this war would have been nice. It seemed as though the greatest war known to man lost it's reasoning somewhere there. Nonetheless this will become a popular film when hitting DVD I have no doubt and for good reason. It's extremely entertaining and still manages to fall in at almost three hours. Bravo to them.9/10",Null,1,3,2 December 2004
Just Go with It," Cool little romance flick, cute, and light
","Adam Sandler comedies are very hit and miss. Click, The Wedding Singer...true brilliance. Big Daddy, his early work like Happy Gilmore, Zoltan...I could go on...utter crap. Now we have this light hearted, cute, funny little comedy Just Go With It. It is somewhere in the middle of some of his previous work. It definitely has its fair share of knee slapping comedy, but is also very predictable and run of the mill which isn't necessarily a fault but it also doesn't make the film stand out in a sea of other romantic films. It does make a great date movie and I think gals will probably enjoy the film more than guys. One of the truly great things about the film are the young stars that play the kids in the film. They have some of the best comedic scenes.Adam Sandler is...well Adam Sandler...nothing new here. He plays rich and womanizing Danny. In a lot of ways his character is sort of unlikable but then at the same time you sort of feel sorry for the guy and he's kind of a down to earth regular guy which Sandler does well at. Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston plays Katherine, Sandler's best friend and office manager. You wouldn't normally expect chemistry between Aniston and Sandler but they are actually pretty decent. They have good comedic timing together and good chemistry. Aniston is impeccably sweet as usual, and she does romantic comedy very well. Brooklyn Decker plays Palmer, the voluptuous, if not slightly vapid object of Sandler's affections. Decker is decent in her role, certainly plays the eye candy role well. This is really her feature film debut and she is decent at it! Probably above average for a model turned actress. Bailee Madison is one of the youngsters I mentioned previously that plays Aniston's children. Madison is truly outstanding and hilarious in her role. This ten year old girl has over a dozen credits to her name and her talent shines through even in this role. Griffin Gluck also does well as the little brother. Madison definitely outshines Gluck but he is still really good too and has some very solid moments in the film. Nick Swardson is silly and annoying as Sandler's cousin. He is usually silly and annoying but it doesn't fit this film when its almost trying to be a serious romantic comedy. Nicole Kidman makes a cameo performance as Aniston's college nemesis Devlin Adams. Considering her role is significantly small she does a great job.Dennis Dugan is the director for this film...not a surprise given he's been riding the Sandler train for years. Dugan is a director that clearly likes slapstick comedy more than telling a story. He has directed some of Sandler's worst comedies including the aforementioned Happy Gilmore and Big Daddy, as well as Zoltan, Chuck and Larry and Grown Ups. He just seems to churn these films out and wants to have a good time instead of making sure he's making a good movie. Just Go With It is a decent film because of the cast and the cute story but it certainly isn't top notch. Its light and fluffy and silly and I just wanted more from it I suppose. I know Sandler is capable, I know Aniston is capable but it does entertain. It isn't legendary comedy or romance but its worth a Saturday night movie night. 7/10",7,2,4,20 August 2011
Brokeback Mountain," I've seen the powerhouse!!
","Brokeback Mountain is shaping out to be one of the most talked, most influential, biggest film is history. It will likely be a film that everyone will remember hearing about in 10, 20, 30 years...it's everywhere and finally I have seen it and I must admit that after all the hype and constant talk, and bombardment I was a little disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away, I was expecting to slap a huge 10/10 on this and rave away but I can't do that. Don't get me wrong this film is breaking barriers for the gay rights movement, has probably changed the face of film history which is fantastic but for the purpose of entertainment which really is what film making is all about...I was a little disappointed.It wasn't the performances by any stretch of the imagination although director Ang Lee's choices for leads and supporting cast is odd to say the least. But perhaps that's because this film is a very odd stretch for Ang Lee himself. Granted his films often deal with societies barriers on women or other repressed situations which Brokeback Mountain certainly tackles. Heath Ledger in the lead role of Ennis Del Mar performs probably his best acting performance to date (although 10 Things I Hate About You is still amazing in my opinion.) His portrayal of a gay man who finds a soul mate far away in the mountains but then must return to society to marry, have children and struggle every day with being gay in secret. His performance is emotional and moving and definitely the best in the film. Matching that powerful performance is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Jack Twist, a man who wants nothing more than to be with Del Mar and is willing to give up everything to be with him despite Del Mar's persistence against it. The film follows both men throughout their lives and we see how they deal with being together and apart off and on, in secret for most of their lives. They deal with wives, children, family, jobs everything all with their love in mind. Both men have different ways of showing their dedicated love to each other. Anne Hathaway in a small role as Jack Twist's wife is very good. She completely shatters her Disney image (which the must less impressive Havoc tried to do.) In her very good role as the emotionally estranged wife she does a great job. Michelle Williams also impresses as Del Mar's wife and the only person to really discover her husband's sexuality. These performances are really what are getting everyone talking...that and the content and story of course. The first real mainstream romance film about two gay men. The setting is also beautiful. Mountains and nature and trees and horses, it's a beautifully shot film and kudos to Mr. Lee for that. You can practically feel the mountain air around you.So where does the film fall short. It does drag on. Clocking in at over two hours, the story never really climaxes and it really just repeats itself over and over and over again. The two men meet, go back to their lives, meet, go back to their lives...over and over. The story could have been just as well told in an hour and a half and kept my attention better. Lee also does a great job at telling the story over the course of approximately 10-15 years and Ledger ages remarkably to a believable mid 40's by the end of the film. I admit I have never seen a movie about gay men especially portrayed in a serious way such as this but I can understand some people being taken aback by certain scenes. I think the film purposely tries to be controversial in some aspect with some rather violent love scenes between Ledger and Gyllenhaal. Also certain scenes of nudity seem to be forced and blatant for just that purpose. Other than that the film serves a purpose, has a decent story but drags far too much. Many will see it, everyone will hear about it and it probably will take home some golden statues. Overall see it because I think that it's a historical moment for film and has some great performances but it is NOT the best film of the year by any means. 7/10",7,2,14,29 January 2006
Orphan," An Amazing and riveting horror experience that still manages to throw a real twist into the mix
","Orphan looked good. Predictable probably but good. My expectations were decent but who knew the film would blow them away. This is probably the best horror film I have seen in a very long time, this year probably. The story is mature and intelligent and so incredibly suspenseful that you will never tear your eyes away. The gore is not used gratuitously but the death scenes are nonetheless terrifying and the performance in the film are outstanding lead by a little girl that under different circumstances deserves an Academy Award in my opinion. Orphan actually turns in a rather unique story with some obvious familiar tones but every film does that, some better than others. The movie will give you a throwback to The Good Son with Macaulay Culkin, Children of The Corn and so forth but the greatness of the performances outweighs any and all familiarity. We may have some great future talent in new writers Alex Mace and David Johnson. Horror might be easy to write but to truly create an experience that will haunt, terrify and horrify, especially nowadays that requires a certain amount of talent.That talent probably owes a huge amount to the twelve year old little girl I mentioned earlier. Isabelle Fuhrman is literally mind blowing as the mentally deranged, secretive Esther. Her dark brooding eyes go from compassionate to killer in seconds and she makes it so believable and you will literally fear this strange little girl. She has probably created one of the most memorable horror killers in movie history and might not even know it. This little girl has a promising career ahead of her because her performance will chill you to the bone. A particularly disturbing scene has her melting down in a bathroom stall and it will send chills through your body. Vera Farmiga gives a powerful performance as the grieving mother who is recovering from the loss of her baby. She is also the one to slowly realize Esther's issues. Farmiga is terrific and a great scream queen but in a far more intelligent way along the lines of Jamie Lee Curtis and that is a great comparison to be made. Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as the perfect macho male, sexy, the perfect father, understanding, hard working but oblivious to Esther. His chemistry with Farmiga is excellent and their scenes together are perfect. Young Jimmy Bennett and lovely little Aryana Engineer (who as in the movie is deaf in real life) play the other children in the family. Both of them give excellent performances and play opposite Fuhrman expertly. As good as she is these two hold their own and manage to really stand out.This cast works so well together with a script that is brilliantly written. This is one of those rare gems that everything just falls into place and blows your mind. Director Jaume Collet-Serra obviously has a talent for horror story telling. Despite being critically and box office panned the House of Wax remake was a great teen horror flick and he seems to have a passion for horror and make us want more. Right away, as an enormous horror fan, the sheer ideas and potential for an Orphan series started to branch in my mind. While it is likely that none of them would ever see the full greatness of the original it would be just incredible to watch. Horror fans pay attention because this might be one of the greatest films of the year and absolutely one of my favorite horror films as of right now. Go see it NOW!! The incredible ending will blow your mind, you will absolutely, unequivocally NEVER see it coming. 9/10",9,4,8,24 August 2009
Home Alone," Ridiculously amazing classic Christmas film...apparently one of my favourites
","When Home Alone released in 1990 I was about 12 so I was the perfect demographic and I loved it. I remember seeing it over and over again in the theatre. It was a HUGE runaway success and made Culkin one of the biggest stars in the world. I've probably seen the movie dozens of times but it has been a few years so I sat down to usher in the Christmas movie season with this one last night. My goodness, what a fantastic movie. I mean everything just works brilliantly for it to be a stone cold classic. Never mind the eventual battle against Marv and Harry which is hilarious with the quintessential gag and trap moments that had me howling out loud, but the overall story is sweet and touching and has so many layers to it. When you think Home Alone, you immediately think of the traps against the burglars but that doesn't even begin until 3/4 of the way through the movie. Everything just fits together perfectly from the cast to the scenery to the story and made me laugh out loud and even cry at the end. While I think it should be geared towards older children just because of some of the thematic elements, this is still a fantastic classic Holiday movie.It is easy to see why Macaulay Culkin was compared to Shirley Temple. His on screen charisma is inexplicable and palpable. I say inexplicable because he honestly doesn't exactly deliver lines particularly well, even awkward at times but it matters absolutely none because he is perfect and adorable and charismatic. The casting only gets better. Joe Pesci who I always find overly dramatic and hyper is born for the role as the headstrong bossy robber Harry. Watching him get bested and beat up is legendary. Daniel Stern plays Pesci's sidekick and the bumbling robber perfectly. The two of them together could not be a better fit for their respective parts. This was sort of Stern's pinnacle and it is easy to see why. The supporting cast are all just amazing. John Heard, Catherine O'Hara, Devin Ratray, and Roberts Blossom all have such important roles and they are so terrific. Some are more subtle than others and they aren't necessary standout roles but they're fun and they work so well in the story. And of course the legendary John Candy makes a fun appearance in the story as well.Chris Columbus is a legendary director. He goes under-appreciated I think but he has such a bold style and everything is colourful and the setting is always as important as his characters and Home Alone is just a perfect fit for him. Add in the brilliant talent of the amazing late John Hughes and you have an absolute film making power couple. Maybe I'm overstating the film because it certainly isn't an Academy Award quality film and I'm sure it isn't critically acclaimed but it is sweet and so much fun and I forgot how truly great it was. I could have literally put the movie back in and watched it again. Make this part of your holiday routine!! 10/10",10,0,1,3 December 2012
About Time," A unique and beautiful story about life. Simply magical!
","I thought the trailers for this film looked pretty good. The cast was good, the concept seemed great and I thought it looked like a very unique indie love story. I was right but I also understated it in my mind. This film was brilliant. Magical. Sweet. Touching and emotional. I loved every minute of it. I laughed and cried and just have been thinking about the film ever since...a surefire sign of a great movie. It is deep and important and has such a beautiful message about life and love. Some harsher reviewers call it unrealistic and a close minded vision of the world and perhaps it is a little neat and tidy but some people live neat and tidy lives and it doesn't do anything to take away from the fact that nearly anyone can find a message here to apply to their own life. It is about seeing the beauty around you. Its the fact that this man can essentially change anything in his life but learns that true beauty is the way the world unfolds as it is. It gives me chills just writing that. This very well may have and should have made my best of 2013 list and I liked it enough that I just may amend my already posted list because this truly moved me.Domhnall Gleeson is just about perfect as the bumbling, adorable everyman Tim. He is just someone you can relate to. He feels real. He isn't a chiseled, square jawed Hollywood superstar and he gives this truly moving, intense, emotional performance that feels right. It isn't an in your face obvious performance but a subtle role that grows on you. The amazing Rachel McAdams is the love of his life and they are stunning together. McAdams seems to have this chemistry with the men in her films (most of them) that is compelling and riveting and passionate. McAdams and Gleeson on the surface may seem like an odd couple and yet that are a match made in heaven to watch. Like Gleeson's performance McAdams and their relationship feels genuine and real. It is a little fairy tale-esque but so what. We all need a little fairy tale romance in our lives. Bill Nighy is brilliant...'nuff said. Honestly, this guy is just charismatic and stunning and you immediately connect with him and fall in love with him as Tim's doting father. Is he the personification of the perfect father? Yes. Again...so what. We don't watch films for reality. I suspected and knew that death would play a part in Nighy's character and there were scenes prior to that where I was almost crying thinking about Tim losing him. He is enigmatic in this role. Lydia Wilson is good as Tim's beloved and extremely quirky sister. Its sort of an odd role that doesn't quite fit in the film and yet she doesn't quite fit in her family so it makes some sort of sense in the grand scheme of things. She still adds a level of fun to the cast and she's good. Lindsay Duncan, Richard Cordery and Joshua McGuire are decent in very small supporting roles.I am genuinely shocked that director Richard Curtis has so few credits to his name as director. That being said Love Actually is considered a modern day Holiday classic (I have yet to see it) and Pirate Radio is also considered great by some. He is a terrific writer having penned some truly outstanding work but he clearly has a handle on his own screenplay here. The cinematography behind this love story is lovely in its own right. The British scenery is serene and beautiful. The film is quirky and funny and awkward and then beautiful and emotional and just deep if you really inspect it. There were so few errors in the film though I think you'll find, as I did, that you'll be asking yourself a few key questions like why he and his father never tell anyone...especially the women they adore so much. The addition of transporting another person in time was rather unexplained and perhaps unnecessary? But I'm grasping at negative straws because I have to go with my gut and how much I enjoyed this. I thought the pacing was perfect and it was just a wonderful romance about love and life. I am forever enamoured with About Time. 9/10",9,2,2,1 February 2014
Spotlight," I get how important it is and yet I have to wonder where the greatness is
","Chances are Spotlight will walk home with Best Picture of The Year at the Oscars. I'm calling it now. I was very excited to see it because I love Michael Keaton and last year's Birdman was so bizarre. Plus this seemed to be the type of film that could only be great with a great cast and an incredible, disturbing and important subject matter. Spotlight is fascinating. It's at least as good as Trumbo was but the problem with this and Trumbo is that both films were just good. Spotlight is based on the horrifying story of a team of reporters at the Boston Globe who single handedly uncover one of the biggest cover-ups in history of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church. It's interesting, it's well acted but it's far from great. The pace is good, nothing gets in the way of the main story and there are strong performances from an ensemble cast. No one really 'stars' in the film but rather everyone works at driving the important story. I felt like from an entertainment perspective it wasn't necessarily thrilling but it does tell the story decently. To me a Best Picture nominee should have all their ducks in a row and Spotlight doesn't really fit that bill for me being just 'good.' Their is no real 'star' in Spotlight because it's an ensemble cast. And despite the big names, no one really stands out because it's not a character driven story really. Still Michael Keaton (who has always been a favourite of mine) brings his usual style and chemistry to the picture and helps properly guide it. I think he gives the best performance even if it is subtle. Rachel McAdams is fantastic in general. I always enjoy her but her performance in this is barely existent and the fact she got an Oscar nomination seems ludicrous. But we all know this can be the case with Oscars. She is background character in this film. Mark Ruffalo is decent and shows a lot of emotion compared to some other characters. Liev Schrieber is also good but a role that is far too small much like Ruffalo's. John Slattery is always a good addition for a character actor but once again, too small of a role. Honestly, everyone else is even smaller roles including Stanley Tucci and Billy Crudup who could have used more screen time. I think the film could have been far more effective if some of the major players have been given more development.It's hard to speak bad of a film that has received so many nominations and is the favourite it win the Best Picture Oscar but I feel like so far the nominations I've seen this year have been sub-par with the exception of Mad Max. I tend to think there is usually some great gems on the Best Picture list but Spotlight doesn't fill those shoes. Tom McCarthy isn't a well versed director and his previous film was one of the most made-fun of (Adam Sandler's The Cobbler) so how did he end up directing this and why does everything think it's 'so great?' I mean Spotlight was good, it's a very important story but a 'great picture?' No not even close. I don't know what the critics see in it but Spotlight is average and watchable but won't floor anyone, it certainly didn't floor me. 7/10",7,3,4,26 January 2016
Terminator Salvation," A new style and turn for the franchise but will it be a good turn?
","The Terminator trilogy, in particular the first two films are iconic and defined a whole new genre of action film. The films balanced this blend of absolutely incredible special effects, horror like plot, and an action superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger in one of the most infamous characters in movie history. So any attempt to create a follow up to the film series that leaves behind modern day to pick up in the future after Judgement Day, eliminates Schwarzenegger and ages hero John Connor by a couple decades is going to be risky and its going to change the entire feel of the film and that is what happens. Also special effects have come a long way so that what we saw in T2 doesn't necessarily impress the same as it does now. Still Terminator Salvation has some great scenes, and still capitalizes on some of the things that are staples to the Terminator series like the T-(enter model number here) with the familiar Terminator hybrid face, the pounding music, and familiar characters established in earlier installments. However, somehow Salvation was missing the epic feel that even Terminator 3 seem to have although it was starting to turn more mainstream by then.Latest Hollywood action star Christian Bale joins the cast as leader of the resistance John Connor who has been played by numerous actors over the years in film and Television. Bale does his usual Batman impression with his customary growly voice and shocked expression on his face. While he carries the film decently he just feels like a one trick pony and I wouldn't be disappointed to see them replace Connor again. I'm thinking someone with more chemistry and charisma on screen. Sam Worthington actually outshines Bale as former human turned Cyborg, Marcus. He just seems to be more heroic, and has a better fit to the film and his character and story to the series is intriguing. I would rather see them base future installments off of his character and bring him back to play the part. Anton Yelchin, who I have had high hopes for since early in his career. He plays the young Kyle Reese and although certainly doesn't look the part he actually does a great job. Actually Yelchin could have played a good John Connor in his young days which probably makes him the perfect person to play Connor's father although they don't know this yet because of the whole time travel aspect...complex in a way. Bale was the weak link in the three main stars of the film sadly.As popular a director as 'McG' seems to be he really hasn't done anything of real substance. His films have been fast paced and chaotic and mostly pure adrenaline without a lot of meat to them ie: Charlies Angels, and TV's short lived Fastlane. He attempts to follow in the footsteps of epic director James Cameron and Jonathan Mostow who is and will be a great storyteller (ever seen the Kurt Russell film breakdown?) and his next film Surrogates is one of my most anticipated sci-fi films this year. Basically McG wants to blow things up, fight with weapons, and then tell a bit of a story to go along with it and for Terminator that recipe doesn't necessarily make a great sequel. I want to get back to the epic post apocalyptic story!! Still it was great to have another entry in the series and bringing Schwarzenegger back even if it was digitally was kick-ass cool. The mini plot and eventual battle between Schwarzenegger's legendary T-800 and Bale's Connor was downright awesome. Worth seeing but if they are trying to reboot or kick start the franchise we need more depth!! 8/10",8,2,4,23 August 2009
Aquaman," Success for a very hard to pull off hero
","My expectations for Aquaman were kept pretty low. To me, as a DC fan, he's barely considered second string hero and the idea of bringing him to the big screen seemed like an insurmountable task. There are a few things they did very right with this film. It's pure science fiction-fantasy so they use that to their advantage. They did similarly with this what they did with the second and third Thor movies where there is very little realism here so they can take liberties with nearly anything. The CGI is extravagant and well done. The film is a visual sight to behold which helps a lot. James Wan as director is a talented, solid director with great vision and this is a bit different for him but he knows how to tell a story and the fantasy visuals needs a story and it works. There were scenes throughout this that I kept thinking should have been nearly completely laughable, it was so cheesy but it worked within the confines of the fantasy of the film.
Jason Momoa is a great choice for Arthur (Aquaman) because he's a far cry from the comic book version. Momoa has great charisma on screen and I'm really starting to enjoy him as an actor. He's massive and larger than life and yet there is something very down to earth about it. Amber Heard is the eye candy in the movie and the romantic interest though that is mostly played down. Heard does decently, she's not an amazing actress by any means but she serves her purpose and her and Momoa are okay together. Patrick Wilson is a nice addition to the cast although I found his character very cheesy at times. Even his line delivery is not exactly 'serious' enough to take seriously. But he is a decent villain to the story. Nicole Kidman is also a nice addition to the cast as Aquaman's mother. She looks amazing and she definitely adds a certain gravitas to the film. Dolph Lundgren, Willem Dafoe, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Graham McTavish and Temuera Morrison all have strong supporting roles. You can tell by the big names they signed to this that on screen charisma helped carry the film a lot.
James Wan created a fantasy epic and that's an important distinction to your typical 'superhero' flick. It's very watchable, it's light and fluffy and it's non-stop action. The action scenes will literally have you on the edge of your seat and that helps you ignore the silliness or the one-liners or the cheesy moments and dialog. It ends up working quite well. I don't think this is the best DC Universe film by any means and I don't think it comes even close to Wonder Woman but I think it does well given that it's Aquaman. I'd be surprised to see them pull this off again but if they follow the same recipe and have the same amount of experience behind the camera and in front then maybe. It is clear now that being without Zack Snyder is still the best for the DC Universe. 7.5/10",7,0,0,24 December 2018
500 Days of Summer," Critically acclaimed romance...but light on the romance
","It would be incredibly hard to convince me that (500) Days of Summer is a romance of any kind. Perhaps one of the reasons that critics were so taken by it is that it is more a story of realistic relationship...sad perhaps but true. Redeemable almost entirely by the sole performance of the male lead but unlike most typical 'romance' movies the female lead is almost entirely unlikable. It isn't the fault of the actress but rather the story that really paints the male character as the deeply emotional, sensitive, and sweet guy and pair him with a commitment phobic, and almost un-emotional girl. The film runs through the almost two years of their on again, off again 'friendship' in various stages and does truly demonstrate every possible range of the relationship. The film has a sweet indie feel to it with some really nice settings and nature like cinematography.Essentially there are two performances in this film that matter at all. The supporting cast is scarce and while they all are decent, there aren't any truly outstanding supporting roles. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is really making a name for himself and I expect he has a big, big role in his future. For the time being he seems to be set into the indie circuit but giving some impressive performances. In this film he borderlines being almost whiny but fortunately stays on the side of truly likable. As Tom Hansen he shows a truly soft side that will make most women melt and most guys feel sensitive...secretly. Has Zooey Deschanel ever had a truly good role? She was decent in Elf. She should have been banned from acting after The Happening. She gives a decent performance in this film but is unfortunately tasked with a very bad character. She has so many emotional problems that she comes across as cold to the man who falls in love with her. They have good chemistry but you get so attached to how Gordon-Levitt feels that you despise Deschanel for hurting him.There is an unfortunate stigma attached to both primarily TV directors, and music video directors. Marc Webb has very little experience on a big screen film and customary to many music video directors they think the best style is to flip through various scenes to tell a story which can sometimes lead to it being rushed and seem like a mish-mash of ideas. The story not always being in chronological order doesn't help but is fairly easy to follow along thanks to the 500 days concept and the naming of what day they are in to their relationship. It has to be said in an off topic I think the idea of Marc Webb being pegged for the Spiderman reboot is a terrible one both pun wise and director wise. The writing team of Michael Weber and Scott Neustadter are new to Hollywood and their only other claim to fame is The Pink Panther 2 (nuff said.) (500) Days of Summer is entertaining and will definitely have you talking by the end of it like gossip bad mouthing Deschanel for what she has done to Tom. See it but don't expect a lovely romance, its rather harsh. 7/10",7,0,0,8 April 2010
Juno," Slightly over-hyped, decent but run of the mill dark comedy
","Juno is perfectly entertaining, decently made, there is nothing essentially wrong with Juno. The only issue is that there is nothing essentially outstanding about Juno either. People are raving about how different and dark and well performed and hilarious...and none of that is wrong per se except that it's not THAT different, dark or well performed. It's average. It's a decent comedy, not much more main stream than Knocked Up, Superbad or other comparable raunch comedies. Now Juno is the receiver of several Academy Award nominations including two big ones...best picture and best Actress and I'm just not sure that it is any more deserving than comedies we've seen that people would laugh off at the thought of receiving Academy nominations. But I am not trying to trash the film because it is entertaining and worth seeing and tackles teen pregnancy head on without taboo's or restrictions which is bringing it a certain amount of controversy and arguments. I don't believe the film is promoting teen pregnancy AT ALL or even poking fun of it or making light of it. Rather I think its saying that this happens...it has happened to this young girl and this is how she deals and copes. This is a reality, it does happen and at best a pregnant teenage girl might see this and think...this doesn't end my life...I have options.Academy Award nominee (as of today) Ellen Page stars as the incomparable and unmatchable Juno. Page is electric and has amazing on screen charisma and really does make the film what it is. She has terrific comedic timing and her sarcasm is unmatched...Oscar worthy...not sure about that. The supporting cast is truly exactly that because the film is entirely about her. Michael Cera, coming off his Superbad success, is Juno's to good to be true, young naive love interest and father to her baby. Cera is perfect in the role and plays it well and they have good chemistry together although he doesn't have a huge role. Jennifer Garner is good but overly sweet in the role as the potential adoptive mother of Juno's baby. She does however relay the perfect mix of anticipation and fear. Jason Bateman plays Garner's husband and I don't know if he was good at it or not. If the goal was to come across as sleazy and creepy then he nailed it but every scene he was in you just expected something huge to come out about him and it never really happens. I'm not sure he was right for this part. Allison Janney and J.K. Simmons are absolutely terrific in their small roles as Juno's parents. They really do a great job, add some humor and some concern to the situation and they really steal their scenes together.My girlfriend made a good point about this film. It felt like you kept waiting for this major climax, like everything was building to something but it never really comes. She gets pregnant, she weighs her options, she has it, she goes back to being a kid again...and that's about it. That makes for a decent story...sure...and it is funny and cute and Paige is terrific but it's NOT the movie of the year nor is it as outstanding as some seem to think it is. I believe that it's average plain and simple. It showcases some future potential talent and probably more adults find it amusing than teenagers or kids but I don't think it quite deserves the hype or nominations that it's receiving. Young director Jason Reitman just stumbled onto this and while he does a decent job telling the story I don't think he has the experience or extreme talent that everyone raves about. I don't want to deter anyone from seeing Juno because it is a lot of fun and you will enjoy it but don't expect the best film of the year by a long shot. 7.5/10**************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.",7,1,7,23 January 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Continues it's unfortunate descent into confusion rather than entertainment
","I will start this review right off the bat by saying it needs a second look by me. When I see it again under proper context I may completely re-edit this review. What do I mean by that?? Pirates of The Caribbean 3: At World's End needs to be watched back to back with it's predecessor Dead Man's Chest. At World's End is so closely entwined with the previous installment that if you haven't seen #2 so that it's completely fresh in your mind you will be confused and completely overwhelmed. This is exactly why the professional critics are calling the film so confusing because Dead Man's Chest was kind of forgettable and because of that At World's End is more of the same. Somewhere along the way during Dead Man's Chest this brilliant Pirate premise and epic lost it's magical touch. Curse of The Black Pearl was downright brilliant but by the third installment you're a little bored with most of the characters and they seem equally as bored. The 300 Million dollar budget is unnecessary when you consider the best part of the trilogy (the original) was made with a 'paltry' 140 million and was brilliant and stunning. That being said the special effects still are very strong in At World's End. The sword play and fight sequences are still amazingly fun but there is far less of it in this installment.I'll start with Johnny Depp who completely changed cinema history by bringing Captain Jack Sparrow to life in 2003. I still find that since Dead Man's Chest and now with At World's End Depp's Sparrow is very toned down and changed. He's more powerful and less subtle and likable. His clever one liners and over the top personality just isn't what it was with the original. All that being said Depp's Jack Sparrow is still memorable and he does still have some great lines and the 'trippy' effect of multiple Jack's is hilarious. He still is great in the role and certainly no one else could play the part. Geoffrey Rush returns as more of an ally as the scurvy Captain Barbossa and really does steal the show. Rush is basically everything Depp's Sparrow used to be. He's funny and evil and yet likable and such a strong anti-hero and he is brilliant. Orlando Bloom returns as William Turner but I'm not sure why because his character is now seemingly useless. He does the usual sword play but he's hardly the hero and barely makes a blip on the radar and is kind of boring now. Keira Knightley also returns as a very different Elizabeth Swann. Her character certainly made the most changes from the original film and not all of them good. She was much better as the damsel in distress who longed for adventure than as a Pirate King who barely resembles a lady any more. She was the balance in a film chock full of testosterone and she certainly left that behind in At World's End. Bill Nighy also returns as the diabolical Davey Jones and his performance is as good as Rush's Barbossa. Davey Jones is a terrific villain and the special effects on him are stunning. Most of the supporting cast are all return character from the original films which is good to see them come back but they really don't add any new character to the series with the exception of Naomie Harris as Tia Dalme and the Ocean Goddess Calypso in a rather unnecessary turn to the story.As a trilogy Pirates of the Caribbean certainly holds it's own but it needs to be seen one after another in a day long Pirate extravaganza. The characters and stories are timeless and instant classics but certainly the series has gradually declined in quality since to the original brilliant beginning. Nonetheless the series is moving on taking 2+ Billion dollars since starting so don't be surprised to see another one coming. I would be fine with this if they take a close look at carefully recreating the characters and coming up with a new less complex storyline. At World's End is a little more violent, a little more dark and still leaves itself wide open for another sequel. If you did love Dead Man's Chest then At World's End will be right up your alley. I was disappointed that they made the catchy and action packed music a little more subtle in this installment and in the entire film Jack Sparrow only says 'Savvy' ONCE!! It's worth seeing but don't expect to be blown away. 6.5/10",6,1,3,4 June 2007
Don Jon," Gorden-Levitt should hang up his directing hat...an atrocious excuse for an 'art-house' film.
","I was sceptical from the moment I saw the trailer for this. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a very talented actor but something about the trailer said to me it could be a bizarre attempt to be 'unique' and 'artsy.' It was exactly that. To classify this as a comedy would seem wrong because it isn't even a little bit funny and is actually more disturbing and uncomfortable than anything. This was an excuse to be raunchy and disgusting and worst of all it barely made sense. The ending was excruciating, there wasn't a single good character in the entire film and the only reason I am scoring it a 3 instead of a 0 is because I actually did laugh for some reason a couple of times and I hung in there hoping that at some point this character would redeem himself or discover the error of his ways but none of that happens. This is a ridiculous, over the top, sex fuelled joke and not a good joke. It shouldn't surprise me that critics have raved about this and try as I might I can't find anything that they would find remotely impressive about this. Gordon-Levitt is a great talent and I can't figure out what about this made him think it was a good idea.Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays triple duty as writer, director and star. His pompous, disgusting, sex addicted character is simply deplorable. I haven't seen a character I disliked this much since Cameron Diaz in Bad Teacher. There is nothing redeemable about him. His New York accent is good but he is completely sleazy and this is by far his worst performance. Not to be outdone his romantic lead (one of them anyways) is played by Scarlett Johansson. She is trash and straight out of a bad SNL skit about New Jersey housewives. Her accent is so over the top and she is ridiculous. She is a satire of a New York woman and I don't think she's supposed to be. Their chemistry is actually decent (another reason this film doesn't get a huge zero) but it doesn't matter because the story is so bad. I adore Tony Danza, he's such a talented and charismatic guy but he throws all that out the window to play the foul mouthed and equally disgusting father to Gordon-Levitt. I was literally disturbed watching nice guy Tony belt out 'F' words like a sailor. He did reflect the family tree of Gordon-Levitt well because both were horrible people and characters. Julianne Moore already has strikes against her because I have never liked her. This movie proves why as she pointless plays an older woman trying to subtly seduce Gordon-Levitt and teach him the true meaning of intimacy. They are bizarre together and gross to be honest. Their story line makes no sense and ends on such a stupid note. Fortunately for the rest of the supporting cast they have such small roles that they are actually tolerable because they aren't given enough time to become irritating.I wish everyone saw this film in the same light because it would ensure that Gordon-Levitt would know he's a terrible director and an even worse writer and stick with what he's good at. If only there was just something redeemable in this story but I can't express enough how little there is here for anyone to enjoy. It isn't entertaining in the least, its depressing and disgusting. Now of course immediately people who want to argue with me will call me a prude and I'm not at all. I can handle just about anything screen IF its a good film or at least a film with purpose and this is neither. I pray I never have to sit through a portion of this again because it was simply awful. In my books this will easily sit in the top three worse movies of 2013. Take my word and skip it no matter how much you like anyone in it. 3/10",3,7,16,31 December 2013
X-Men," One of the most well made, intelligent Superhero, comic adaptations to date!!
","Okay so it is a Marvel creation...I can cut it slack for that ha ha kidding kidding...settle down Marvel fans. It's true I've always been a DC fan but still X-Men are classic heroes at the finest and director Bryan Singer do an incredible job bringing the heroes to life. In fact I think X-Men is one of the most well cast films ever period!! Everyone is perfect for their roles, everyone is exactly what you expect from them, the story line is deep and intelligent and the action is amazing and non stop and builds to a good vs evil blow out at the statue of Liberty. How can you top that?? Unknown Aussie actor Hugh Jackman nailed the lead as Logan/'Wolverine.' Certainly looks wise he had the part down cold but it was so much more than that. He absolutely made Wolverine. He was exactly what the character was and always has been. He is a great action hero, and the part made Jackman into a star and for good reason. I only wish he did more action parts. Still he is and always will be Wolverine. His character gets the best story, the best character arc, the most depth and he pulls it off with incredible emotion and personality. How could Patrick Stewart not be Professor Charles Xavier?? He looked the part, talked the part, he was perfect. He was just as perfect as Jackman was for the role. Stewart exudes intellect and he is a great fatherly figure to them all. The terrific Ian McKellen plays the evil Magneto. He's the perfect villain because he has such great intellect, a great history with Charles Xavier as friends and enemies and he's almost a misunderstood villain with seemingly pure reasons behind his madness. Famke Janssen plays the telepathically powerful Jean Grey. Although she too plays her role very intelligent, her performance is a little wooden and not entirely important. She could have done a lot more with the character. James Marsden plays Scott 'Cyclops' Summers. Unfortunately Cyclops doesn't have a huge role and it's a great character. On top of that Marsden is terrific in the part. His chemistry opposite Jackman's Wolverine is fun and hilarious at times as they banter and fight over Jean Grey's affections. Halle Berry is the star power as Storm. Apparently she doesn't like how small her part is but I think she does a great job and she does have a significant role. I think Berry's performance as Storm is actually one of her best. She too completely embodies the character. Young Anna Paquin plays the naive Rogue who finds her way to the Xmen. Rogue and Wolverine have a heavy story together and Jackman and Paquin are good together in the father-daughter type role. Paquin is a little quiet but she looks very forlorn and you feel sorry for her character. She's a little young to be playing Rogue but still her character is important and she's good enough to carry it. The rest of the cast (mostly bad guys) are fantastic, Tyler Mane, Rebecca Romijn, Ray Park, and Bruce Davison are all fantastic in their smaller but very significant roles. Romijn is especially intriguing under all the make up as the deadly and mysterious Mystique...able to take the form of ANYONE. This is without a doubt her best role as well.If Bryan Singer had a hand in casting...bravo to him for pulling together the absolutely perfect cast. They all clicked together unlike anything I've ever seen. On top that for an action film and a super-hero film this has one of the best story lines I have ever seen. There is no origins to cover per se but instead launches immediately into the brewing war between Mutants and humans. Singer creates a future world where fear creates a chasm between them. X-Men is a terrific action film, and starts a great series!! So much potential for sequels and so much amazing story and characters. It's a must see!! 8.5/10",8,0,0,26 May 2006
Spider-Man 3," Spiderman 3 single handedly takes on the question...can you have too much of a good thing??
","You can definitely have to have too much of a good thing. Spiderman 3 is the first film to truly be so packed it's practically bursting at the seams. I expected to see this film and disagree with all its critics but instead I found myself agreeing with everything they said. The film is busy and drama heavy, and story driven but the content of Spiderman 3 is enough for literally 3 different films so you feel like you're often watching 3 different installments of Spiderman. It's like they decided to give you Spiderman 3-7 all in one shot. If Spiderman 3 wasn't...well Spiderman 3 this could have potentially killed this series but fortunately despite heavy negatives in the film Spiderman 3 also had some MAJOR good that really balance the scales. The one definitive thing about Sam Raimi's Spiderman since day one is that it's very down to earth, they are the guys and girls next door and the stories have always been emotionally driven and packed full of action and Spiderman 3 still holds true to that formula.Tobey Maguire returns as Peter Parker and Spiderman. There was something lacking from this performance, perhaps a bit of boredom on the part of Maguire. He seems to have milked the character all he could and it was more a job to him than something he believed in. That being said he still pulls off the hero better than anyone else could. Kirsten Dunst also returns as Mary Jane Watson. Dunst has taken all three films to really hone the character of Mary Jane to balance it between the script, the fans and her own performance and I think she's come a long way and does a terrific job. Her and Tobey have terrific chemistry and are good together. James Franco returns as, the bent on vengeance, Harry Osbourne who gets to return to his old self when he loses his memory. I think Franco is very talented and has had some truly terrific roles and Harry Osbourne/The New Goblin is one of them and the turning point for him in the end really make this a terrific character. Maguire, Dunst, and Franco have had truly great chemistry since day one and Spiderman 3 is no different. Newcomers include Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko and The Sandman. Church is a strong performer but the script here doesn't give him a lot to work with although they really do try to give him a back story. His character is the type of bad guy that deserved an entire film dedicated to him but instead he gets one fourth shared with the other villains. Most of his performance is CGI which is done brilliantly so I don't think Church is given his fair shake and I hope he gets a future Spiderman flick to make up for it. Topher Grace is the slightly slimy adversary to Peter Parker who eventually gets turned into Venom. Grace is good, there is nothing wrong with his performance but he gets ripped off because if ANYONE deserves an entire story line dedicated to him it would be comic book legend Venom and in fact it's not until the last 45 minutes of the film that he gets revealed. Grace is one of several of the new characters who gets buried beneath the multiple villains. Bryce Dallas Howard is the newest gal on the block and I think her addition was a good one. So far Dunst's Mary Jane hasn't had any competition for the leading lady and Howard does a decent job and she's sweet and complex and a good addition. Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons (who is hilarious and gets some great lines), Dylan Baker, Bruce Campbell, and Willem Dafoe all return in various degrees to reprise their roles from previous Spiderman flicks.The action scenes are brilliant, the fights are intense and the mid-air acrobatics appropriately stunning and the CGI is probably the best it has ever been in the series. So here's the beefs. WAY TOO MANY VILLAINS!! Sandman, Venom and even New Goblin all deserved their own film instead of forcing them all into one film that got very crowded for some very cool villains. I found some glaring inconsistencies with the story like how Spiderman manages to take a colossal beating from giant sand fists and still walk away from it?? The one thing for me that really got to me and it's always been present in the Spiderman films but Spiderman always ends up with his mask off or torn to reveal his face and he's gotta be one of the worst super heroes as far as keeping his identity a secret. Every villain discovers his identity and he seems to spend a lot of time with his mask off. I think a Superhero and his alter ego need to be kept distinctly separate because there is this aura of power to each side of his identity and that line is very, very blurry in the Spiderman movies. Keep your mask on and get a better tailor so your suit doesn't rip every time you get punched. The entire story of the black suit could have been done a little differently...I think the entire segment of Peter disco dancing down Times Square was cheesy as hell and completely unnecessary. There were a little downs to this third installment BUT it is still worth seeing because of the glaring positives and incredible action and great story from this trilogy to date and Spiderman 3 has already moved into position of being the highest grossing film of all time. Go see it in the theater and just take heed that it's a little heavy on some things but they got carried away and a little excited. Hopefully this won't be the last of the web slinger and his friends. 8.5/10",8,0,1,22 May 2007
Thor: Ragnarok," Is there even a reason to review Marvel films anymore?
","Someone recently said Superhero films were the Millenium's version of the Western and that may be accurate. Westerns were around for a very, very long time and changed cinema history and there are some really good ones and some really terrible ones. No matter what you have to give insane kudos to Disney and Marvel for creating the largest cinematic Universe ever spanning Television and film and knocking it out of the park every...single....time. What was their mis-step out of 20+ films? The Incredible Hulk? Maybe. They've recouped that a hundred times over. I haven't always been super impressed with everything they've done and I do think certain aspects of the franchise is showing wear. The first Thor I actually thought was one of their least impressive films but the second one I thought was absolutely incredible. Thor Ragnorak falls somewhere in the middle for me. However, that's on sheer entertainment because as I read some things on this film I realized the sheer dept and fan service they pay to true comic fans. I was always a DC Comics kid so I miss a lot of the Easter eggs but Marvel fans must be over the moon. The film also is much more comedic than others in the Universe, above and beyond what would normally be there and honestly (especially in the beginning) it felt a little forced. The CGI is decent and the characters are a ton of fun. I honestly think Ragnarok was built for the die hard Thor and Hulk fans and they probably love it.Chris Hemsworth returns to the role as the God of Thunder. Hemsworth is one of the Marvel castings that was done with complete perfection. God help anyone ever having to play this role after him. In Ragnarok I found he wasn't quite as 'strong' as he was in other films but then that also makes sense too given the storyline. He still commands the film perfectly and best of all his ego doesn't get in the way of the other characters. He shares the spotlight perfectly. Mark Ruffalo also appears as Bruce Banner and The Hulk. I personally think they made The Hulk look more like him. I'm not a Ruffalo fan and I never thought he was particularly well cast but he does well in this. He's basically always the same as Banner. He and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Tessa Thompson joins the team and apparently it's a huge deal for fans as she plays Valkyrie. She is a great character and perfect in her role. I loved the setup for her friendship with Hulk. I could see her carrying her own film. Tom Hiddleston also returns with perfection as Loki. He and Hemsworth have always had incredible chemistry and it's great seeing him back. He's one of the best anti-heroes/sometimes villains in movies. And you can't hav a great hero with a villian or in this case a villainess as Cate Blanchett takes that role. She is one of my least favorite actrors (I know...blasphemy) but she is good in this part. She is perfect given the story. Also to be honest, I knew she looked familiar but I couldn't place her at all until I read here. As with many Marvel films but especially Ragnarok the supporting cast is amazing. Jeff Goldblum, Idris Elba, Karl Urban (fantastic role), Anthony Hopkins, Taika Waititi (who is also the director and he gives an amazing voice role in a hilarious and fun turn as 'Korg' who was easily my favorite character in the movie.Taika Waititi is not a well known director and yet he handles this big budget Marvel spectacle expertly. I can't imagine what it must be like handling these characters and the special effects and the lore and the story and do so quite well. The space travel alone is incredible and the battle scenes as well and the amount of choreography and people involved. So really my review is this ... for me who is not a huge Marvel fan but respect the heck out of this massive Universe and the popcorn type fun it provides, it was okay on the scale of what they've offered. But for those of you who adore Marvel and have been fans all your lives, I think you'll be blown away by this and the Easter eggs are plentiful. This definitely shows that the universe is not in danger of slowing down anytime soon. 7/10",7,0,3,22 December 2017
Yes Man," Jim Carrey returns to what he knows and does very well
","I was very excited to see that Jim Carrey was making a turn to what made him famous...slapstick comedy. Obviously Yes Man looked far more intelligent than, say, Dumb and Dumber or the Ace Ventura films but it still looked like finally he was going to give the comedies that made him bucket loads of cash in the nineties. The obvious comparisons to Liar Liar flowed freely but first of all Liar Liar was one of his last really great, drop dead hilarious comedies so comparisons wouldn't be a bad thing. Secondly after seeing the film it has very, very little actually in common with the film. Yes Man is a little less slap stick and more serious but even still the movie is fun and a throw back to the old Carrey films and just a lot of fun. It's not the perfect comedy but there is certainly nothing wrong with it. The concept has a lot of potential, the idea of a man saying yes to everything automatically makes for a lot of funny moments. Obvious critics will call it stereotypical and predictable and compare it to Liar Liar but the movie really does hold it's own merits.I have always enjoyed Jim Carrey's films, he's always been crazy and fun and is the master of physical comedy and of course his crazy facial antics. On top of all this we know that Carrey has actual range as an actor. The Number 23, The Truman Show and the under appreciated The Majestic prove that he can act which definitely helps with making a good film. He also has terrific on screen presence. He makes Yes Man a fun and really good watch. Zooey Deschanel plays Carrey's love interest. Deschanel is a little strange as an actress. I'm still trying to forget her deplorable performance in The Happening ((shudder)) but even still her and Carrey don't really jive. I mean they are okay but just not the picture perfect movie couple by any means and she doesn't have a lot of personality for comedy. She worked in Elf because the movie was odd and Will Ferrell is a nut. Terence Stamp is also good in a small cameo role as the leader of the 'Yes' cult that changes Carrey's character's life.Yes Man won't throw you back to Carrey's wild antics of yesteryear but it is definitely a worthwhile comedy. Director Peyton Reed is a strong director and has done some good films but nothing really slapstick other than the cult classic Cheerleader comedy (which I secretly enjoy) Bring It On. However I do think this film will help Reed's career for comedies. So all in all Yes Man might not be a billion dollar comedy but for anyone who wants to see a funny little film on a Saturday Night will enjoy Carrey's latest flick. 7.5/10",7,0,0,23 January 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," One of the most underrated action classics returns and continues to kick some ass!!
","As a huge fan of the games for years I might have expected to nit pick about the details of the original Resident Evil film. They really did kind of move away from the story while still keeping key elements and characters in tact and in doing so they created this absolutely brilliant action series that I think is completely and utterly underrated and under appreciated. Resident Evil: Extinction is yet another third in a summer of overwhelming trilogies and this one stands out on it's own. I keep thinking about seeing previous installments that as badly as I want a sequel it won't fly, it won't do as well and they keep surprising the heck out of me. Each time they just seem to do something really clever that keeps this story on the cutting edge and avoids the pit falls of worn out, tired film series'. Extinction focuses firmly on the story, the outbreak of the virus and the completely obliteration of the world as we know it. This is the ultimate post apocalyptic film and the best of it's type I've seen in years...maybe since the Mad Max trilogy. Best of all Resident Evil, the entire series, should be heralded as one of the truly unique action films by creating an absolutely brilliant female hero that girls can really say...see she kicks ass. Milla Jovovich's Alice should be in the history books as one of the greatest female heroines in history. Not only that but they usually add in a secondary female hero and in this case they added the familiar game character of Claire Redfield. I think they pulled back a little on the obscene amount of action that the predecessors had in order to roll out some really good story and characters but then they had their share of incredible action moments to keep things rolling at break neck speed. Best of all they didn't go light on the key elements of Resident Evil...ZOMBIES. Zombie birds, zombie dogs and a new breed of Nemesis to contend with.Milla Jovovich returns as the only reoccurring character since the first film, Alice. Now genetically enhanced by Umbrella she is learning to utilize her mind powers to save and help others. Her powers are never cheap or campy and they really do work in the environment given. Jovovich completely embodies Alice and she is just riveting to watch in her action scenes. Her intense look and small frame make her just awesome and she still looks beautiful, without being sleazy. Oded Fehr also returns from Apocalypse as Carlos, a character I have always really liked. He still does a good job and really does look the Resident Evil part while still being a very viable character. His part is not huge but it's very important and he does well at it. Ali Larter is good as the secondary female hero (and possible future main hero) Claire Redfield who is the leader of the convoy. Larter is pretty good and does command certain respect on screen but she is heavily overshadowed by Jovovich's performance and character. Iain Glen is the evil Dr. Isaacs who is determined to use Alice to domesticate the zombies. He also eventually becomes the second nemesis which is really something to see and is just plain awesome.I think perhaps more than most movie franchises Resident Evil has incredible longevity and potential and having seen what they've been able to do with the first three installments they can do an incredible job. Just when I think it couldn't be as good they surprise me with something really fun to watch, full of action, horror, gore and a terrific story and really great characters. They have also had the fortunate experience of having some great directors and Extinction director Russell Mulcahy is no exception. He is a talented and well experienced director having worked on such films as Rambo III, Highlander and Tales of the Crypt (I mention those because you sense a little of each in Extinction.) Also writer (and director of the first installment) Paul Anderson knows the characters and seems to have a passion for the story. Truly this is one of the fall greats and a must see for action/horror fans. 9/10",9,2,5,24 September 2007
Midnight in Paris," A solid enchanting drama that will entertain and make you smile
","If you're a movie connoisseur and you want to read the review about camera angles and the brilliance of Woody Allen this won't be the review for you. I have seen two...maybe three Woody Allen films and I have enjoyed them but I have yet to become an Allen fan so to speak. Midnight In Paris is a unique and interesting film that blends dark humour, drama, romance with...time travel...yah no kidding! The film, as far as I am concerned has only one glaring flaw and I'll get to that in a few moments. I went into the film not really knowing what to expect given I had only seen a trailer or two which doesn't show much. I think I felt a connection to the main character, although I'm not a professional writer, I understood some of his eccentricities about writing and inspiration so I think perhaps Allen might have worked some of his own personality into the character. The setting of Paris is of course beautiful and instead of just focusing on the typical Paris you get to see more of the back streets and of course the nightlife. The story moves at a brisk pace, especially for a dramedy never leaving you bored or wondering when things will pick up.I mentioned before that the film had one glaring error and that error is the lead, Owen Wilson. I don't dislike Wilson, he's had some good movies always playing the weird quirky stammering male lead but in this film he just does not fit. He just isn't believable when he's trying to be serious. His stammering and weird talking just botches up the feel of the film. He drags it down when the film could have been a nine or even a ten if a strong male lead had been chosen. The always lovely Rachel McAdams plays the headstrong and perhaps overbearing rich girl that Wilson is engaged to. She becomes more oppressive to Wilson throughout the course of the film. McAdams always has a lot of screen presence but her character is very unlikable by the end of it which is unfortunate. The chemistry between her and Wilson is nearing a joke which helps with their inevitable break up. Amazing character actors Kurt Fuller, and Mimi Kennedy are McAdams' parents and although they don't get a lot of screen time, they are truly terrific. This film lives and breathes the supporting cast. Tom Hiddleston, Corey Stoll, Alison Pill (brilliant! in her role), and of course the incomparable Kathy Bates are part of the stand out supporting characters you should watch for. They just make this film great! There is no doubt Woody Allen knows quirky better than anyone else but I sat in the theatre when it was over and thought...wow he just made a quirky dramedy with a touch of the supernatural and made time travel artsy and isn't that impressive? I thought the ending of the film was a little cut and dry and perhaps a little predictable but it definitely tied up all the loose ends. There is zero doubt in Allen's ability to write interesting characters and draw you into the story. I think the only downfall is that you find yourself wanting to know more, and see more from characters who are only secondary. Anyone wanting a solid drama, something light and breezy but fun to watch and unique you will love Midnight In Paris. As I said before I have only seen a couple of Allen's films but so far I can see why he has had a career spanning decades and is known for his style. 8/10",Null,1,2,7 August 2011
The Last Song," An unbiased opinion...the movie is still not good...sorry Disney
","I am an absolute sucker for Disney films...live action or otherwise. I have also enjoyed previous Nicholas Sparks films and I, unlike many, many other adults have no hatred or dislike towards Miley Cyrus. I think she has talent and is an idol to millions of young girls and has never done anything overtly outrageous to cause scandal so my dislike of this film has nothing to do with the stupidity of hating a film just because Cyrus is in it. In fact I thought the Hannah Montana movie was cute for what it is. The fact is this is one of the most boring Sparks films and stories and this is the first one he adapted himself. Maybe it worked in book form but I won't be rushing to read it because nearly two hours of a story that really could have been told in five minutes around a camp fire is enough for me. The characters were vapid and empty, the sad ending was forced and annoying and the good performances were buried under a long rather boring story, and a love story that happens so fast your head will spin. In fact The Last Song shows why love is so convoluted given the two fall in deep 'real' love after ten minutes of being together. Its just really silly drivel and its not Cyrus' fault but she doesn't help either.Tween starlet Miley Cyrus tries her chops at drama and I think she might have some acting talent somewhere in her but this wasn't it. She was far too young for this role and her transformation from wild rebel child to good girl was just silly. They even make her physically look softer throughout the film to get the point across that she is reforming from her ways and 'growing up.' Cyrus doesn't ruin the film but is given nothing, and does nothing to add to it either. Alleged real life boyfriend Liam Hemsworth plays Will. Cyrus and him have okay chemistry but he looks so much older than her. In reality there is only two years between them but they just look awkward together despite their chemistry. His character is okay and he likely will have a decent career if he can survive the backlash from this film. Greg Kinnear is a great actor. He's proved it in As Good As It Gets and Little Miss Sunshine and he gets at least a little meat in this film. He gets a better character than others and he pulls off the Dad role with real style. He has good chemistry with Cyrus and Bobby Coleman who plays his son. Coleman deserves mention as he gives literally the best performance in the film. At thirteen he is not new to acting but he literally makes the film nearly redeemable with his strong, emotional performance as the younger son of Kinnear. Kelly Preston (Mrs. Travolta) makes a cameo as the Mom...it doesn't matter.I love Television. I think Television has some amazing shows with amazing actors but I have this personal stigma against directors going from Television to big screen films because they never seem to know how to handle it. Director Julie Anne Robinson has had a lot of experience on the small screen but this is literally her move into big screen and it falls flat and part of that must rest on her shoulders. The story is long and drawn out, the romance is weak, the plot is mostly silly...how much time needs to be spent on the stupid sea turtles? I wanted to really enjoy this movie, I wanted to laugh, cry, and love the characters and I did none of that...except laugh but it was for the wrong reasons. I would give this entire cast including Cyrus another chance in another picture but this one is just plain silly. Skip it and wait for something far more touching and well written and directed...please. 4/10",4,14,23,4 April 2010
Zodiac," All the facts are laid out, a straight forward and such a little slow moving account of an infamous crime spree
","Zodiac has some great pluses on it's side. As a pseudo-documentary the facts are laid out in plain terms, the storyline and time line are kept in tact and it would feel like nothing is added for dramatic element or to make the film more crowd pleasing and that is definitely okay!! For main stream audiences heading into Zodiac with the thought of this being some sort of action film or even a thriller might find themselves disappointed because this is a very real account of the horrific murders by the still at large Zodiac killer in Sanfrancisco, chronicling from his start in the late 60's right through to almost modern day but mostly ending in the early eighties and how the crimes effected three people in particular some to this day. The cast is well done but ultimately a film like this isn't about the cast and really doesn't give them anything to sink their teeth in because the film is about the killer...Zodiac...hence the name. One of the most beautiful things about the film is it doesn't leave the ending open like I thought it would but rather actually gives an opinion or possible and most likely suspect and how they track him. I mean of course because they are stating their opinion it's going to show the facts weighing in the direction of their suspect and I do encourage anyone after seeing this film to look at other books to see the weight of evidence against their suspect but none the less it made the film much easier to watch knowing there was going to be an outcome.Jake Gyllenhaal gets the most of the story by portraying cartoonist and eventual Zodiac obsessive researcher Robert Graysmith, the writer whose book the film is based on. My only thought about Gyllenhall is that he looked very young in the sixties and he looked very young in the eighties, they made little attempt if any to make him look older. However his gradual fall into obsession is well documented and intriguing to watch and when he really gets into investigating the case it really does move the film along and his discoveries are downright fascinating. Mark Ruffalo, who I often find a little bland, is actually not bad as Inspector David Toschi who is put in charge of the case. Toschi shows a softer side of obsession, hiding it better, but you can see his intense desire to uncover the truth and you see it more when he unwillingly helps Graysmith. Ruffalo and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry playing off each other and I still think Ruffalo is a little too laid back but he does an okay job. Robert Downey Jr. plays himself...well close anyways...he actually plays crime reporter for the Chronicle Paul Avery who eventually goes on a downward spiral of drugs and alcohol. I don't know if they intend his substance abuse to be a result of the investigation but I never got that. In fact for the most part I got the impression Avery didn't really care all that much about Zodiac but just getting drunk and high and making money. Downey Jr. just seemed like he was having a good time and I didn't think his performance or his role added much to the film. Chloë Sevigny is just kind of there for her role as Gyllenhaal's wife. She never shows all that much emotion or adds anything to the story. Anthony Edwards is decent enough in a small role as Ruffalo's partner Inspector William Armstrong. Cleverly the Zodiac during his murder scenes are actually portrayed by three different actors. This makes everything more interesting because they never look the same and it implies the difference in witness descriptions and that he always claimed he didn't look the same when committing his murders. John Carroll Lynch is quite good in his small role as their number one suspect Arthur Leigh Allen. He fits the profile and is believable as the killer but at the same time believable he might not be.I might say that part of the problem with Zodiac is the cast but I don't know if it is. I don't think casting anyone else in any other roles would have made any difference because the plot and story is just very analytical. It isn't really about the characters. David Fincher is no amateur to directing. In fact he was the genius behind one of the greatest crime films of all time 'Se7en' and also directed the classic action film 'Alien.' But he left behind that element of science fiction or dark, gritty, fiction and went head over heels straight forward crime documentary and there is nothing wrong with that and I think it will come to be appreciated in the future. The thing was the film felt like it belonged on Television. There was nothing about it that made it Hollywood worth while. It could have aired on The History Channel, or America's Most Wanted as re-enactment or even been a great TV Series but for a movie it kinda misses the mark somewhere. Still worth seeing especially for fans of real crime or history buffs and despite it's huge running time most of it goes by quickly and keeps you interested. 7/10",7,1,7,6 March 2007
The Terminator," A Full on sci-fi action classic that defines the genre
","If Arnold Schwarzenegger were to ever come close to deserving any sort of acclamation for his acting...academy award or otherwise this would have been it. This movie made him! and he in turn made this movie...he is and always will be The Terminator. Many forget that this original classic sci-fi action story he is NOT the hero. The Terminator is a deadly machine assassin sent into the past to destroy the mother of the man who will ultimately bring the machines to their end many years in the future. Schwarzenegger is deadly and brilliant, and robotic and downright evil. You can't help but be scared to death of this guy and that's awesome!! He doesn't have a lot of lines but he does the whole role with his motions and his reactions to things which makes for a pretty good actor I think.James Cameron who wrote and directed the film created one of the world's best sci fi stories. This film which takes place entirely in 1984 gives you such an in depth look at a world far beyond their current time. It's a world where a deadly war has practically wiped out the human race and now they are taking the battle through time in order to win it. Even in a brief flashback we are treated to a glimpse into the world that can only be described as pure hell. Throughout this entire film one woman is being brutally stalked by this beast of a robot and only one man from the future stands between them. Michael Biehn plays Kyle Reese with great intensity and a believability that he is indeed a soldier from the future. Despite the fact that it seems this Termintor is deadly and unstoppable, this man, this soldier is a worthy adversary. Linda Hamilton in her infamous role as Sarah Conner, the future mother of the man who will save humanity unless The Terminator can destroy her first. She seems like a such a quiet innocent person but as the movie progresses we see her character become stronger, faster, and just a worth adversary herself. She's not gonna die without a fight and she's not going to let this newfound knowledge of a bleak future ruin her. Biehn and Hamilton have awesome chemistry and you believe their relationship from the very beginning. The Terminator is the exact definition of non-stop action. It's constant, leaving you on the edge of your seat. Everyone's performance in the film is awesome and very watchable and you root for all of them. Best of all Schwarzenegger is an unbelievable machine that makes for one of film histories best bad guys. The film is gritty and very real, gory, bloody, no holds barred and without a doubt one of the best action films ever created. James Cameron created something unstoppable with this franchise. Everyone has to see The Termintor, it's just a must see movie and you won't be disappointed by what it has to offer!!! There is so much more to it than just your average action flick. 9/10",9,1,2,30 October 2005
Hellboy II: The Golden Army," Unfortunately points are lost for being an art showing for Guillermo del Toro...which loses some of the Hellboy greatness
","After seeing the first Hellboy again and being generally blown away by the powerful story, strong characters, really emotionally charged super heroes and with a beautiful array of characters and general science fiction greatness I certainly set my expectations high for this sequel. In some ways it was terrific, especially to see the old gang back and getting into their relationships. I definitely had wished character Abe Sapien had played a bigger role in the first one and they brought him to the forefront for the sequel which was awesome...even gave him the romance story line. The reviews started flooding in and they all said the same thing...beautiful, stunning creatures, the brilliance of del Toro...and all that is true but is that why I wanted to see Hellboy on the big screen again? If they managed a balance of stunning artistry and cinematography with the characters and story like they did the first time around then it would have been perfect but it seems like the film makers (del Toro in particular) wanted to use Hellboy 2 to show off his artistry and pretty, pretty designs and the movie suffered a little because of it. I'm not saying it wasn't good...the film was good enough and very entertaining and some genuinely great moments (Abe and Hellboy's drunken love song, the battle with the beast in the streets while Hellboy balances a baby.) Also the relationship that has grown with Hellboy and Liz. Still it didn't quite have the same magic of the original.Ron Perlman flies back into his incredible role as the one and only Hellboy. He is quite simply amazing and perfect in the role. I didn't feel like he had quite the same biting wit but the character is still amazing and Perlman nails it!! Selma Blair returns as Hellboy's now girlfriend Liz Sherman. I loved her character in the first film, they gave her so much depth and a terrific story and somehow this time around she lacked the same depth and came across as a little cold overall. Still her and Perlman have great chemistry. Doug Jones returns as well as one of my favorite sidekicks Abe Sapien. He gets a much bigger role as I mentioned and that's terrific!! However I felt the missing component was David Hyde Pierce as Abe Sapien's voice. While Doug Jones was good (he is very talented) I still felt like something was missing, like he wasn't quite the same. Pierce has a very distinct talent at voices. Luke Goss is decent as the main bad guy Prince Nuada although from the trailers I kind of expected more from him somehow. Anna Walton is also decent as Princess Nuada and the object of Abe's affection.Even with all the new demons and monsters and bad guys and a decently solid story the bad guys weren't nearly as good or effective as they were from the first installment. Who could forget Hitler's Assassin with his killer blades, Rasputin and Sammeal. Prince Nuada seems almost useless compared to them. Still the adventure is well in tact and as I stated there are some very cool scenes and plenty of adventure. The Angel of Death was an incredible site to see and Brian Steele who played Sammeal in the original film is terrific as Fragglewump. When all is said and done Hellboy 2 is a solid action summer film but doesn't quite live up to what they started with the original brilliance of the original film. I think they took a step down to let del Toro who has become a bit of an icon do his thing and it took away from the core idea of the film. Still well worth seeing if you love Hellboy like I do. 8/10",8,4,9,30 July 2008
Cloverfield," The first big monster hit of the New Year fares well
","Shrouded in mystery Cloverfield will likely be remembered for a brilliant marketing campaign that left everyone who saw Transformers in the summer wondering what the heck is that monster clobbering New York City. My first instinct was whatever was big and strong enough to decapitate the State of Liberty and make that much disaster was going to get over hyped and be disappointing to finally see on the big screen but I was dead wrong in that aspect. I wasn't even remotely disappointed by the monster. JJ Abrams is a brilliant director, and writer and has created some really terrific things including the mystery shrouded 'Lost' TV Series and you can definitely see some of that carry over into Cloverfield. The one thing that everyone should know and will know coming out of this is that all the questions you have going into the film, you'll have the same ones coming out and probably a lot more. But this is the idea because you're not watching this film...you're experiencing it. You're right there with all the other survivors trying to stay alive and there are numerous ways that they went about doing this. The first if the much debated about 'hand cam.' I do agree it was overplayed, a little annoying, but didn't make me motion sick. They left it still enough to really get the feeling of the whole situation but I just really wanted to see everything slower and more stable. I understand perfectly why they did it that way...I just wasn't a huge fan. Second of all I've never sat in a movie where the sound was so carefully plotted. When that beast roars for the first time it literally vibrated my seat and you felt like you were right there.The literal cast of nobodies are brilliant. Michael Stahl-David is the lead Rob Hawkins who is looking at moving up in the corporate world and is attending a surprise going away party for him when disaster strikes. Stahl-David is a hero because he's just a regular guy caught in disastrous situations. He looks smooth, cool, well liked and yet normal. He goes through the emotions perfectly and draws you in and has great charisma on screen. T.J. Miller is a very important character but probably has less than 5 minutes of screen time and is yet probably 'on screen' more than anyone else. He's the man behind the hand cam and his acting relies on his voice and his emotion and his actions and he does well. He's inappropriately funny at times but I think that IS his character's way. He is basically narrating the situation while experiencing it and it works. Jessica Lucas is Rob's brother's girlfriend and does a good job in her role. She is sort of the scream queen of the situation and in that aspect she does very well. Lizzy Caplan is terrific as the straight faced, goth like girl who is the only one victim to being actually bitten by part of this beast. She has one of the most talked about and mysterious scenes and she is terrific in a very subtle quiet way.There is obviously a certain suspension of belief required to see Cloverfield and kudos to Abrams for attempting to deal with it. The idea that someone in this situation would continually ensure they were holding on to a video camera no matter what is kind of ludicrous and although he insists in the film that people will want to see this...there is a point when any normal person would have dropped the camera and ran like hell. Still I completely understand why they opted to do the hand camera...it feels real and it works. I also understand why they left the shroud of mystery BUT it doesn't make either one of those things any more tolerable. I enjoyed experiencing this monster attack but I wanted from an entertainment value to KNOW the background, the secrets, the origin....nobody likes leaving with that many questions and maybe they'll serialize Cloverfield but it'll never have the same impact that this original film has. Despite some unfortunate fatal flaws Cloverfield is a monster of a movie and a great time at the movies. The first blockbuster of the year. And it makes people argue, debate, and wonder and that is always healthy for intellect. 8/10*************** NOTE Yesterday on Tuesday January 22/2008 star of big screen hits Heath Ledger passed away in his home. I just want to wish his family, his daughter, and Michelle Williams and all his friends my deepest sympathy and I always believed he was destined to be a big star. I will most certainly miss his work.",8,1,4,23 January 2008
Silent Hill," Everyone deserves an opinion....Silent Hill's complex nature intrigued me
","Silent Hill appears to be a genuine sore spot as people argue and bicker about it...was it good, was it smart, was it stupid, was it poorly done...and the name calling and petty bickering is stupid. To each their own...and that goes triple for movies. This was without a doubt one of my most anticipated films of the year and for three quarters of the film I had very, very mixed emotions. At some point I thought how stupid the whole thing was and how disappointed I was. And then next thing I knew I was drawn into it and really started to appreciate it's campy horror, sub-par acting and twisted, disturbing storyline.First of all let's deal with this whole video game adaptation issue. We have to accept it, it's a way of Hollywood existence now and some will be good and probably more than some will be really bad. Silent Hill is not entirely a video game adaptation. Sure the idea and structure is loosely based on it but the story and characters are entirely unique. You DO NOT have had to play the game to appreciate or enjoy this film. I don't think it would make a lick of difference either way. I've played nearly all of them and it made no difference whatsoever. Fairly inexperienced director Christophe Gans, and gore-fest writer Roger Avary do a fair job of making the video game references very subtle. The story is complex, mystifying even at times (critics both professional and amateur are raving about how they don't understand it.) I admit I didn't find it THAT complex but there is no doubt that it's a deeply twisted and disturbing story but doesn't it have to be?? Isn't that what we wanted out of Silent Hill?? Radha Mitchell takes the lead as adoring mother Rose DeSilva. Now she certainly manages to captivate and hold her own as the main character in a small cast but her acting is campy (perhaps on purpose), a little over the top at times, but sufficient. She does the trick as the hero. Impressive is the work of the quite young, but already very experienced Jodelle Ferland who takes the role of Rose's daughter Sharon but ALSO the role of her evil incarnation Alessa. She is disturbing and horrific and plays both sides of the coin very well and convincingly. Her performance is the highlight of the film. Laurie Holden is the queen of camp in her performance as tough as nails cop Cybil Bennett. Her movements, wardrobe and lines all scream video game (which I assume and hope is on purpose.) I think it was necessary for Mitchell's character to have a partner in the bleak city of Silent Hill for Holden was important but they didn't seem to have great chemistry which would have improved Holden's role significantly. Finally Sean Bean plays husband and father Christopher DeSilva in a tacked on and obviously added role which really had no bearing on the story other than perhaps and hopefully to set up for a sequel. I love Bean and I think he's an incredible actor which is why it's unfortunate to see him so severely underused in this role.Silent Hill the set was brilliantly made. The city was creepy and quiet (even the music stopped at some points to give you that feeling of horrific serenity.) There were some parts that were made to pay homage to the game that only hardcore fans would recognize as being sets directly lifted from the game. The monsters in Silent Hill were defined and brilliantly made if not occasionally poorly presented. Sometimes it felt like Mitchell's character was simply running from one side of the city to the other just so they could show off a new breed of monster but then again each one was more terrifying than the previous and they were magnificent. You could figure out the story despite it's complexity, and I DO NOT think anyone who really watches it would walk out confused. I think it all came together with only some plot holes that are unavoidable when making a film like this. I think it was the beginning of a brutal, bloody, wicked, horror series and I think this first entry will become absolutely a horror classic with defined monsters and horribly gory scenes and disturbing moments. The film is open to some interpretation and how great is it if a typical slasher horror film can ACTUALLY be unique and thought provoking?? The ending is even more brilliant and opens up a can of worms you can only imagine!! If you're a die hard fan of strange, sci-fi, almost TOO weird films you will DROOL over Silent Hill. It has it's shortcomings but I happen to think it is brilliant!! A series this HAS TO BE!! 9/10",9,4,7,22 April 2006
Hotel Rwanda," Beautiful, and Touching, everyone must see!!
","2004, at least late 2004, may turn out to be the greatest period of cinema in the last 20 years at least. With the brilliance of such films as Million Dollar Baby and Finding Neverland and this heavy hitter but sadly under rated Hotel Rwanda. How does a film like this not get nominated for Best Picture by the Academy? Hotel Rwanda is the true story of Hotel Manager Paul Rusesabagina during the most turbulent time of Rwandan history. The two warring factions the Hutu's and the Tutsis are almost reaching a peace agreement when the Rwandan Presient is assassinated. Paul is big time businessman who spends his time making top connections in the event he needs to call in favors during war time. When war breaks out, Paul finds himself involuntarily harboring refugees in his hotel. As he is gradually immersed in horrifying images and war crimes against his own people, he stands strong and helps over 1200 refugees and saves their lives.Don Cheadle is amazing, he's always been a talented actor but Hotel Rwanda will launch his leading acting career. His leadership qualities and his role is amazing. I must admit, I find the supporting cast, including his wife, played by Sophie Okonedo, Nick Nolte, brief appearance by Joaquin Phoenix, and the hotel staff are certainly adequate but no one particularly stand out especially against Don Cheadle's role. But the cast really isn't what makes this movie a true astonishing film. It's the writing and the film making and the story, combined with Don Cheadle's role. Terry George focus's on the true horror of the Genocide situation, and Paul's struggle to save his own family but not at the cost of everyone else. He is determined to not let anyone die. The scenes of the bodies are disturbing and will bring tears to your eyes, and you feel Paul's compassion for this people. This might not be a well remembered event but after experiencing Hotel Rwanda, you won't ever forget it. It's without a doubt one of the best pictures you will see this year!! 10/10",Null,5,7,3 March 2005
The Adventures of Tintin," Terrific action packed adventure, full of fun!!
","Welcome back Mr. Spielberg! Does anyone know adventure like he does? In his first animated adventure Spielberg brings to life the iconic comic book sleuth/Journalist and I loved every minute of it. From the streets of France to the desert, to the Ocean, to Africa and beyond, it has everything a great adventure needs and could want and has some truly terrific characters. Kids, adults, young at heart will love this action packed, edge of your seat thrill ride with a great mystery. Many of the complaints I heard about the film is that perhaps it was almost a little too action packed, as they did seem to cram as much as they could all into one film but you can't chastise them for being too ambitious. Being an animated film, even motion capture, means that they can do some pretty outstanding and crazy stunts and comedic moments but still keep it real. The motion capture animation is stunning and truly unique and I hope they do more of this type of animation and Spielberg and Jackson do it better than anyone.The voice acting is brilliant. Jamie Bell captures Tin Tin absolutely perfectly. He has the innocence and the curiosity and the heroism down to perfection. Andy Serkis, a brilliant talent, who has made absolute perfection out of motion capture in films like Rise of the Planet of The Apes, and King Kong, and Lord of The Rings and now shines as Tin Tin's partner in mystery Captain Haddock. The alcoholic anti-hero is hilarious and fun however almost over used but still a lot of fun and the perfect balance to prim and proper Tin Tin. Daniel Craig is terrific as the villainous Sakharine, and his voice is barely recognizable. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg also do a great job as the comedic and bumbling Thomson and Thompson.Tin Tin is part Indiana Jones, part old school mystery and all fun. Spielberg knows how to spin a story and no holds barred adventure and isn't afraid to tread lightly and follow politically correct movie barriers (a character is seen smoking and of course Haddock's insatiable drinking problem), neither of these things will send anyone off to buy cigarettes and a carton of rum and they are just a small part of the adventure. Maybe not for young kids but certainly older kids and adults will absolutely love it and for good reason! The story borders on being a little too complicated but it stays within the realm of understanding and when the film is all over you will wish to see it all again or better yet see another adventure of this terrific iteration of Tin Tin that was YEARS in the making. Do yourself a favor and see this terrific movie. The 3D was okay but as usual doesn't make or break the film. You can see it either way. 9/10",9,0,2,7 January 2012
Ocean's Twelve," What can one expect?
","If you read my review for Ocean's 11 you'll much better understand this review for it's follow up. You can understand why they would all want to make a sequel and hats off to them for bringing back the entire cast including director Stephen Soderbergh, how often is that doable? As expected, or at least as I expected the follow up to a great movie in 2001 falls short in many ways. The 2001 remake was made to bring together some of Hollywood's actors and have a great time. They lost this magic doing the sequel, in fact for most of the film the cast seems downright depressed.The story picks up three years after the original. Terry Benedict has finally tracked down Danny Ocean and his eleven accomplices who robbed him of 160 million dollars. Now that he's found them he wants every penny back plus interest to the tune of about 198 million dollars or he's going to kill every last one of them. So Danny and Rusty hatch a new scheme (no pun intended.) The twelve of them go to Europe in order to find a big heist to pay back Benedict. They find two of the world's master thieves and get into a competition with the one they call Nightfox. If Ocean and his men can boost a precious egg from high security before Nightfox does, Nightfox will pay their debt to Benedict.I think Soderbergh attempted to not recreate the first film and simply redo scenes using the same style but by doing that he actually lost what the original movie had. The plot was not nearly as good and much of the film was just very pointless. In the original, everyone and everything had a purpose. Every thing we as the audience saw happen, even if we thought it was an error turned out to be part of a clever and elaborate plan. In Ocean's 12 we don't even see them pull the heist and nothing they do has anything to do with the plot or plan. In the original each character had his own purpose, his own job and in the sequel, none of them had any reason to be there whatsoever. The first robbery they pull in Europe has no bearing or reason behind it. Clooney's character seems bored and rushed. The addition of Hollywood heavyweight Catherine Zeta Jones was a brilliant addition of the ex-girlfriend of Pitt's character who happens to work for Europol as a detective. She's always hot on their trails but that part of the plot is badly underused. The one thing Soderbergh did reuse and try and capture was the blend of on screen/off screen and having Julia Roberts' character Tess Ocean sneak in the museum portraying someone she looked a lot like (Julia Roberts) was a good laugh and very cheeky although rather unbelievable. Cameo's were no less brilliant in this one having the amazing Bruce Willis join in briefly, Albert Finney in a small role, and bringing back Scott Schwartz for his role as Bruiser, however briefly was humorous. The film is not an entire write off but that's mostly because it's fun to see the whole entire cast back, not letting anyone go. The plot and writing is where this film loses out but I'm not sure they could have done it any better for a film that didn't really warrant a sequel. I love sequels and I would see the next 20 Oceans film no matter how bad they were so let's hope they STOP making them here so I don't have to subject myself to that. 5/10",5,1,2,4 January 2005
Crash," Vitally important and disturbing film!!
","Crash is not the most entertaining piece of work I've seen. It's not a great theater film or a have a good time kinda film or the kind of film that you'd rant about how 'cool' it was. BUT Crash is one of the most important and disturbing pieces of film making I have ever seen. It's almost of a documentary quality but with an incredible cast of Hollywood stars that do such an incredible job at portraying everything the way it was meant to be. Crash is, at the core, all about racism, stereotypes, the human condition and redemption. It's an art film there is no doubt about it but with a clear and concise and often scary message.The plot is very multi-storied. You have several different stories, occasionally overlapping about different people in different circumstances of different races. They all have different reasons for the feelings that they share about life and about these other races. White, Black, Chinese, East Indian, Mexican, many different races are presented in the film and I don't believe (despite what anyone says on here) that any one race is presented in any different of a light. I believe Paul Haggis who directed and wrote the film did an amazing job of portraying all these people and races in the same sort of distinction which is a seemingly impossible job. He walks such an incredibly thin line that could have turned this film into an insult to so many but he perfects it!! Let's talk about this cast...a run down of the stars...Don Cheadle, Jennifer Esposito, Matt Dillon, Sandra Bullock, Brendan Fraser, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Ludicrous, Shaun Toub, Loretta Devine, Tony Danza, Bahar Soomekh and so many more. The brilliant thing about this cast is that they reflect what the film is about. This is a racial mix of Hollywood stars. They all represent a different portion of humanity. To talk about any one of their performances would be pointless. They all share nearly the same amount of screen time as there is so much going on in the film. They all do an incredible job. Watching their stories is just as interesting as real life and just as scary. They all have their reasons for their particular bigotry and for some of them they find redemption and for others they never do. Crash was not made for entertainment but for a message, a sad, harsh, well meant message about humanity and racial equality and living together. And how sad and lonely we all are to the point where we would crash into another human being just have contact. Check this one out for something different and important in film making!!",9,1,6,4 September 2005
The Bodyguard," An undeniable classic thriller, Costner at the very height of his career
","The Bodyguard was always one of my favourite Costner flicks. I am a huge Costner fan even though he has slipped from Hollywood stardom in the last few years. I hadn't seen The Bodyguard in awhile and wanted to review it so I sat down to enjoy it again. I was surprised to discover that I found it a little slow at times, that it looked a little dated, and while I still enjoyed my favourite parts, the grainy and gritty romantic thriller definitely ages itself. But don't let that discourage you. The film is still a classic of its time. The pace of the film is definitely methodical, it doesn't apologize for taking its time to really lay out the characters and the mystery surround the stalker. The characters are all very well developed and the chemistry between Costner and Houston is really what makes this film, and the music of course. Houston's soundtrack to the film is formidable, and brilliant and you buy her as an insanely successful pop princess because she was and still is.Kevin Costner's Frank Farmer is this brooding, seemingly hardened former Secret Service agent. He enters the film mysteriously but you learn more about him throughout the film. Its really a great character and I can't imagine for minute anyone other than Costner playing the role. The late and legendary Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron. She's the hot headed, short tempered diva but her character takes a lot of turns too and she definitely becomes more likable though she really does remain a diva throughout. Her and Costner are just sexy and brilliant together. The film has a terrific supporting cast including Bill Cobbs, Gary Kemp, Tomas Arana and Mike Starr should be called out for especially strong supporting performances. Michele Lamar Richards does an okay job as Marron's sister Nicki. I always thought she was one of the poorer performances in the film which is really unfortunate especially being what a big important part she has in the film. DeVaughn Nixon does a decent job as Marron's son Fletcher.Everyone works very well together and some of the chemistry (as previously mentioned) is truly great while others go a little understated like Houston and Richards as sisters. Director Mick Jackson was really just getting his legs under him when he directed this film. He does a good job, his direction is decent, but the pacing could have definitely been better handled by more experience. I think he got lucky with a strong cast, especially the stars, and a well written story. Regardless of its few flaws and its slow pace, The Bodyguard is a nineties classic and must see viewing for Costner fans and Houston fans. Its the perfect romantic thriller for a quiet date night. 7/10",7,0,2,24 September 2012
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The most spectacular third installment of any series...completely mind blowing
","If you watch all three of the original Star Wars films, by the time you reach the end of Star Wars: Return of The Jedi your jaw will be on the floor and you will be forever a fan of the Star Wars universe. Return of the Jedi is the most brilliant of the original three films. It is mind blowing and the best story, battles, creatures and more!! It also ironically is the film that probably has the most memorable and pop culturally significant moments. Right from the beginning you have the world of Tattooine and Jabba The Hut and eventually Princess Leia's infamous gold slave bra and outfit. The object of every teenage boys fantasy in the eighties. Yoda's touching death and Luke's full circle training as a Jedi. The intense and special effect driven escape from Jabba The Hut with Han Solo and the incredible final showdown between Luke and his father Darth Vader while an incredible battle rages on Endor with the adorably creepy Ewoks. All of this is packed into the third installment and it is truly a spectacle to see. Considering the film picks up exactly where Empire Strikes Back ends you really need to watch all three films but this one installment makes the entire original series worth while. Return of the Jedi is by far the best!!The entire original cast returns as well as the new characters picked up from Empire Strikes back. I would love to go into detail of the entire cast but I can only break it down slightly. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are still brilliant feisty heroes and their romance comes to full fruition. Mark Hamill definitely gets the biggest character arc as he becomes full on hero from his original rather naive young Skywalker in the first film. While Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew return to their infamous sidekick roles they don't change much from the previous films but there is nothing wrong with that by any means. They are great characters and fun to watch and there is no reason to change them. David Prowse and James Earl Jones reprise the best villain in movie history as Darth Vader who has also come full circle in his character and the final battle between him and Luke with the Emperor goading them on is just awesome...worth watching just on it's own.As good as the original cast is returning in this film the true brilliance of it is the masterful special effects. Jabba The Hut and his entire world around him, the Ewoks and their world and the incredible battles that happen, can all be mostly attributed to the brilliant creations of George Lucas and director Richard Marquand. Marquand actually appears to be a mostly new director but he handles this project like a complete pro and probably set him for life. However you feel about the Star Wars Universe you can't help but respect the original films and how they progressively got better. Return of The Jedi stands alone as being an absolutely brilliant film in story, characters and special effects. One of my favorite films hands down. 10/10",10,2,5,27 February 2009
Fast & Furious 6," Keeps on keeping on
","This is my first time through the Fast and Furious franchise. I eat all my words I ever said about the series. I scoffed at how popular it was and now I get it. In fact, this is one of the best action franchises to have come along. Fast 6 returns to true form with breathtaking action, stunts, heists, car chases and a climatic battle against a massive airplane. The series has come a far cry from it's street racing days but maybe that's okay and it works for this series too. Vin Diesel still proves he's got it at least in this franchise and he commands the team effortlessly. Paul Walker is a little more subtly a lead than he was in previous instalments but he still does a good job. For such an ensemble cast, everyone has their moment and everyone is important to 'the family' Justin Lin is an incredible action director. Do you have to suspend belief? Sure sometimes like most great action films but he knows what we want to see to be purely entertained. The villain in Fast 6 was a little underwhelming (perhaps on purpose - stay tuned for future instalments) but he wasn't as strong as some of the others in previous films. Dwayne Johnson returns as well and whereas in the last film he and Vin were enemies of sorts now they're working together and this adds a whole new level of action and excitement to the film. This franchise holds it's own and you won't be disappointed in this sixth part. 8/10",8,1,2,27 April 2019
The Expendables," Their is plenty good, and probably plenty bad but one of my most anticipated films of 2010 darn well entertained!!
","I think I could write a whole book on The Expendables so bare with me while I reduce it to IMDb friendly size. I love Sly Stallone. I've been a huge fan of his for years and years since I was a young lad. I think he's one of the greatest action stars of all time and I was on pins and needles taking in every detail of his newest film. So my expectations were anything but low but I also knew exactly what to expect from this film as well. Anyone going in thinking they are going to see anything more than what they promise shouldn't see the film. Massive explosions, bulging muscles, action stars, cameos, gun fire, blood, violence, gratuitous everything (except nudity perhaps surprisingly.) A dictator in a foreign country, mercenaries, and a sleazy villain. All of these come in at break neck speed. The action is so brutal and non stop that it leaves you breathless and cleverly and appropriately hides the films negative aspects. The cheese is in place and purposely so I have no doubt. This was meant to be Stallone's homage to everything action and mostly from the 80's when he was in his prime and you couldn't possibly have an homage to 80's action without plenty of cheese.Sylvester Stallone still knows how to impress his audience. He knows what people want and he delivers it...still to this day. He knows the red blooded 20-30 something males want to see people being ridiculously eviscerated regardless of reality or story. His character could definitely use some more depth. I would love to find out more of his back story and where he came from and how he puts together his team. But regardless of that he still looks awesome and does his proper role. Perhaps the best action star of the current generation is Jason Statham so it definitely makes sense to have him in the film as runner up to Stallone. Statham gives a solid performance and is a little less dark than he is in some of his other roles. I really wanted Stallone and Statham to have wicked chemistry and it isn't bad but it isn't as good as it should be for this type of film. Eric Roberts is actually the perfect 80's action flick villain. I would have liked to have seen more of him but he was absolutely great. He was one of the best characters in the film. Jet Li is decent but very underused as one of the members of The Expendables. I hope he gets a lot more depth and use in future sequels (oh yah baby get ready for them.) He also rarely does his trademark Martial Arts. Dolph Lundgren is terrific and actually gets the most depth out of his character ironically and even that isn't much. The battle with Lundgren and Li is great but where was the Stallone/Lundgren fight?? The person I thought I could do the most without was Mickey Rourke (I'm not a fan) but imagine my surprise when he actually turned in one of the best and most emotional performances. He doesn't even get into the action but is like the heart of the team. I would love to see him come back for future instalments. Now here is the list of 'main' characters that could be completely removed or replaced and you would never notice...Randy Couture, Steve Austin, and Terry Crews. I know I left some performances out but I only have so much room and I have more to say. And finally to the much talked about cameos and meeting of the three masters Stallone, Willis and Schwarzenegger. Yes the scene was very small. But it was also effective and fun. I mean Stallone did the impossible...he California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to play a role...it was small of course but there was even some back story there. And the direction of the character was well done and the witty repertoire between the three of them was fun as well. I think peoples expectations of the scene were far too high. We can always hope Willis will return for a bigger role next time.The Expendables is far from a perfect film. The character depth is practically non existent and I wanted to know more about them. The film was mega hyped as this massive collaboration of huge action stars but let's be real...it may have started that way but in the end you have Stallone and Statham, Li as maybe a supporting big action star, Lundgren perhaps but fighters and athletes and pro-wrestlers don't equal big action stars. Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis (in a full role), VanDamme, Seagal, Snipes, Gibson, Cruise, Weathers, Norris (and I can't stand Chuck Norris), Nolte, Eastwood, Bronson (yah he's dead)...that would be an ensemble action cast. Still I have no complaints about the film as an action flick. The body count was huge and the 'R' rating was firmly in tact and that is the way it should be. Many will hate The Expendables but you have to take it for why Stallone created it and for that reason the film is a man lovin' action masterpiece and I for one am cheering out loud that Stallone gets his comeback especially at this age. 8.5/10",8,5,13,18 August 2010
Pan's Labyrinth," Slightly over rated but decently directed epic
","I fully expected to be one of Pan's fans that jumped on the 'greatest fantasy of the year' band wagon so when I finally got around to seeing the critically acclaimed Pan's Labyrinth I must admit I felt a little let down. I am not saying that the film isn't stunning with it's special effects and it's brilliant, dark, gritty story but I was just taken aback by the content. First of all it is hard to call this film a fantasy and even consider it on the same level as Lord Of The Rings, or Chronicles of Narnia because the actual fantasy content is barely a blip in the film. There might be perhaps 1/4 of the film that features this magical land she journeys to. Now that 1/4 truly has some brilliant, almost disturbing and magical effects that are spell binding and the outside world content is so dark and violent. I honestly believed Pan's Labyrinth was a child's movie when it was originally released and it's the FURTHEST thing from it. Pan's Labyrinth is an adult film through and through and deserves an R-Rating with some brutally violent death scenes. Still the film moved a little slowly for my liking and just didn't capture me the way I had hoped. I want to love it, I still want to see it again to see if I can find some more appreciation for it because it IS so beautiful but I have to stick with my first impressions and it just wasn't perfect. But there is so much to love about it and it's still an absolute must see.First and foremost the young star Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia is absolutely brilliant. She deserves every award she was nominated for. Her breath taking and emotional performance holds this film together and makes it all the more better for having her there. Bravo to the young actress!! Equally impressive is the performance by Sergi López who plays the despicably evil Capitán Vidal who is like an in house dictator who kills indiscriminately to protect what he believes to be right. While he never hurts Ofelia directly his behavior is one that will sour you on him. López is just brilliant as this villain that by the time he meets his just end it's almost a relief to the viewer as much as it is to the people in the film. Maribel Verdú is very good as the house servant who is working to help the rebels including her brother. She is like a surrogate savior to the rebels, her brother, and to Ofelia following her mother's death. Doug Jones won't be remembered by his real face. Jones has been portraying some of the greatest monsters, beasts, and general weird looking creatures for many years. He still haunts me as The Gentlmen from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. He turns in a terrific performance as the pale beast or Pan presumably (although never established.) Who is the pale beast?? That is I think one of the most interesting questions from the film.Does Pan's Labyrinth have some amazing moments?? Absolutely!! I won't soon forget the creature at the dinner table who chases Ofelia with the eyes in his hands. I won't soon forget the moment Capitán Vidal beats an innocent man's head in (literally) and drops him to die. The direction by Guillermo del Toro is truly inspirational with the dark gray overtone of the film and contrasting it to the brilliance of the other world, and the deep bright red of Ofelia's blood. I make no sincere negative comments about this film except to say that as good as it was it just didn't quite hit the right chords to be perfection and I so wanted it to be perfection. I wanted this to be one of my favorite films. Still I would see it again and I would recommend it to any adult that loves a good strong story. The subtitles are done perfectly and I wouldn't have had it any other way. Make your own judgment about Pan's Labyrinth because either way you won't want to miss out on it. 8.5/10",8,1,5,4 June 2007
Final Destination 2," Campy, poorly acted, and wickedly gory!!! Still a must see!!
","I'm kind of seeing this series again in reverse. I saw the terrific third installment and happened to catch the second recently. I remember always being impressed with this series but found this time around a little campy. Has it always been this campy?? I don't know but Final Destination still has a way of scaring the living daylights out of you and imagining EVERY worse case scenario. Whereas the first one made you scared to death to ever set foot on a place, this one makes you never want to see another car for the rest of your life. Within the first half hour you are treated to one of the goriest, horrendous, shocking death scene car crashes I have ever seen. Brilliantly directed, shockingly real and brutal...it's just horrifying. Following that we are given the usual Final Destination track down as Death systematically begins to murder each survivor in the most obscure, original, and horrifying ways imaginable. If anything Final Destination has breathed new life into original death scenes which is a must for the Horror/Slasher genre and Final Destination has it nailed. I don't know how the writers continue to come up with it. It's always a surprise and you never know what's going be the death of them.A.J. Cook picks up the lead as Kimberly Corman, the psychic girl who envisions the car crash the saves a group from dying but sets them up in Death's path. Cook is a little bland and over acts in several scenes adding to the campy feel of the film. Campy is not bad, especially in the horror genre but Final Destination feels like it should be more intelligent than campy. Cook does an okay job but her emotions don't really match the situations. Within hours of three of her best friends dying in the most horrific way she appears to be fine. When discovering Death is stalking them, despite a few tense moments, she doesn't seem overly moved by it. They could have cast better but she is alright. Michael Landes (Jimmy Olsen from one of my favorite TV classic Series Lois and Clark) is Officer Thomas Burke, the male lead. He always looks like a deer caught in the headlights which I suppose is the proper look given the situation. He doesn't quite have the acting strength to carry off the lead role and all in all he doesn't get subjected to the same amount of torture as the rest of them. Still him and Cook have decent chemistry although no romance is ever implied and he does a decent job much as Cook does. Ali Larter returns as the only returning character from the original film as Clear Rivers. Disturbed and having herself locked away to protect herself she finally comes out to help the new batch of survivors beat Death (because she did so well the first time everyone but her being dead now.) She is good as the veteran of the team but she does come across as a bit of a raving mad woman at times. But I won't complain because I love cross overs from previous horror installments into new ones. I'm glad they brought her back especially since I usually can't stand Devon Sawa (who was the lead in the original.) The rest of the cast in their small roles as eventual victims all do a decent job of blatantly establishing their characters and thus becoming victims of circumstance to their personalities.The problem with Final Destination 2 over the previous one and the latter one is the cast. It's not nearly as strong as it has been or is now and the cast over acts and comes across as cheesy which is never good given the horrifying original death scenes. But because of a strong script of horror and the establishment of a connection between this film and the previous one it's a must see. The Death scenes are infamous and classic and original and just shocking it's almost funny but you feel scared to death as you chuckle at them. The story line is a little difficult and it feels a little forced especially the connection to the original and the way they end things up in how they 'conquer' Death. They try to be fresh and original but overall doesn't exactly work as far as the story line goes. It's more complex than it should be. Stunt man David R. Ellis who has a huge film coming out this summer 'Snakes On A Plane' is obviously well versed in stunts and choreographing harrowing scenes but his direction of cast might need something to be desired. Still #2 in the series you must see just because as a whole the trilogy to date is one of the most unique horror thrillers to be made in recent years. Horror fans will love it!! 7/10",7,0,0,22 July 2006
Blade II," Long awaited, decent sequel!!
","Sequels are always tough but I personally love sequels, sometimes even a bad sequel is good just because you missed the characters.  Blade 2 brings Wesley Snipes back as a kick-butt action hero who is also part Vampire...how can you go wrong with a story line like that?  I will say Blade 2 doesn't touch how good Blade was.  Blade was a deep story, packed with action, and depth, and was so fascinating and dark.  Blade 2 keeps it's dark appearance which is very good...I would hate to see Blade go soft on us.  It's a relief that they also went out of their way to bring back Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) who gives us a anti-hero...something just not right about his character and yet he's like Blade's only weakness because of his love for his mentor and father-figure.  In this story, Blade is approached by the Vampires seeking his help this time.  Something is hunting the Vampires and ripped them to shreds and in the process creating something worse than a Vampire.  They are called Reapers.  Blade agrees to join a squad of mercenary Vamp killers who were trained to kill him originally and work with them to rid the world of these Reapers who will eventually turn on humans. Blade still doesn't let his guard down and doesn't trust his new allies. This is the basis of the story.  The story is very shallow and could have been written so much better.  It had so much potential and I just think they got through it as quickly as possible.  Fortunately for them it's action packed, and the fight sequences are still pretty good.  But for the most part the savior is Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson returning in their roles.  They save the movie they make it worth while because they are just great super hero's.  Otherwise the movie is lost in RIDICULOUS special effects, that I could do sitting at home in front of my Desktop computer. The effects are computer generation and they show, you can pin point exactly where the real people end and AI takes over.  It's annoying and campy.  The music is just absolutely lost in this one.  In the original Blade the music is unbelievably complimenting the story line and Blade.  It's thumping and exciting and makes you heart race.  In this one, the music is barely a part of it.  Blade's sudden use of a magical gun that explodes Vampires into little computerized sparkles of dust is just plain stupid.  Now can you believe after all those things I just listed that I would still tell you to go see this movie???  As I said, the original characters make it worth while and some of the new Vamps are interesting.  I sincerely hope they carry on the Blade franchise but I hope they go back to the original Blade to continue from and not Blade 2.  Definately go see it for action and just because Blade rocks but don't be surprised if it's not quite what the first one was.  I give it a 7/10",Null,1,2,25 April 2002
Knocked Up," Knocked Up is an absolute blast!! So slapstick funny and yet one of the most interesting and real human stories
","Knocked Up looked 'funny' right out of the gate. The trailers were hilarious and the fact that the director, writer and producer Judd Apatow surprised the heck out of my last year with 'The Forty Year Old Virgin' I was really looking forward to this film. I am not a fan of gross out comedy or even gratuitous so called 'adult' comedies, I usually find them childish and annoying but, much like The Forty Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up blew me away!! It's not the fact that it turned out to be roll in the aisles hilarious with an amazingly funny cast, a hilarious script, and moments that just had me busting up but it was the fact that Knocked Up might be one of the most real, and important looks at adult relationships, and men and women that is out there today. This film candidly looks at both sides and completely explores the Men are From Venus, Women are from Mars theory and doesn't offend either side but rather speaks to both sides. Women can sit in this film and nod and say...that is so true and meanwhile their men who were dragged to see Knocked Up (I went more than willingly) are sitting there thinking...that's exactly right...from the guy's perspective. It's a real, important, downright hilarious, touching, cute, funny, dirty, 'F' bomb dropping drama-fast making it quite possibly one of the greatest films of 2007.Seth Rogen is a genius. The guy...well he's a guy. I mean that's not to say we're all stoners with no future or job but ultimately he's the every day guy. He plays Ben Stone, an adult who hasn't quite had any reason to leave his immaturity behind. He does what he wants, when he wants with who he wants and he thinks his life is perfect. Rogen is so good because he's just the every day guy. He's almost a loser and yet I think any guy can see something of themselves in him. Plus he's not chiseled, good looking, made up to look like some fake hunk of man. He's a dude. Bravo to him because his rants are hilarious, his romantic moments are well played. His one night stand and sudden romantic partner is played by Katherine Heigl. I love Heigl from Grey's Anatomy and was excited to see her in a big screen role and she does a good job. Unfortunately I don't she does as good a job as some of the other cast members. She comes across as a little plastic at times despite her numerous emotional moments and while she still get some truly funny lines they often come across a little plain and underperformed. Still she does well and her and Rogan have great chemistry which is awesome for this movie. I think I might love Paul Rudd despite his attention to the annoying Will Ferrell comedy troupe as I call them. Rudd's performance as Heigl's brother in law is hilarious, perhaps one of the funniest and most unique performances in the film. His droll, calm demeanor makes every line he has hilarious. Rudd I think is ready for his own film now because he can hold his own. Leslie Mann plays Heigl's sister Debbie. Debbie is long time married, getting older, very sarcastic and bitter about much of her life and that makes her hilarious and serious all in the same breath. She is the perfect balance to Heigl and also to Rudd's performance. The two of them together are the perfect balance to Heigl and Rogan's new relationship. The supporting cast of friends are kind of typical, very crude but insanely funny at the same time and include Jason Segel, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr, and Charlyne Yi. They are the crazy friends you might expect for this type of film but times ten.The fact that Apatow was able to make a film this incredibly funny and still have this very real male vs female battle the likes I haven't seen since When Harry Met Sally is pretty impressive. I think Knocked Up will become a new generations When Harry Met Sally because it truly deserves it. This film shows a lot of very funny parts in the trailer but unlike some unfortunate comedies when those parts come up they are still funny and even more hilarious because of the story and script around it. There were moments where I was still laughing from the previous joke when a new one comes about. Go see this one immediately, take the one you love and discuss it after because it turns in an incredible film. It runs a little long, clocks in at well over 2 hours but doesn't apologize for that because there is plenty to the story. Check it out!! 9/10",9,0,6,5 June 2007
The Book Thief," A war film with a different sort of spin. A beautiful story with a horrifying backdrop
","The trailers for the film intrigued me. I didn't really know entirely what it was about but it looked interesting and it looked moving and powerful. I honestly didn't find the film 'powerful' per se. But moving...absolutely. It was just a sweet story with some terrifying twists and turns, some heart wrenching moments and it does transport you to a very different time. One thing I really loved about this film is that it isn't American or Canadian or any other allied country but rather set in the heart of Germany. These are German people and families in this small village and throughout the film some of them even head off to war and they are fight for Hitler but we still see how that affects them and their families. The performances are terrific and draw you into these people's lives. The pacing of the film is near perfect and the musical score is lovely. Everything about this movie works. At the same time there was something about it that didn't exactly blow me away like other war films like Warhorse or Schindler's List but this film is just a little less gritty and a little more on the heart of the film rather than the war itself that plays on emotions. The film is all about survival and its absolutely a must see.How amazing is Sophie Nelisse? She is a relative newcomer and this is the first film I have seen her in but she is simply captivating. She draws you into her character and her sad story and you rejoice with her in her triumphs. She is just perfect for this part and really does shine. Geoffrey Rush...this guy is always phenomenal. He is so good in this and you just will absolutely love Hans. I mean, the character is written for you to fall in love with his sweet nature but Rush embodies the character and is so great. Its a subtle performance and much like the film, it won't blow you away and yet its a great character and performance. Emily Watson is equally as terrific as the hard nosed house wife who begins to fall in love with her new daughter. She's tough as nails and when she softens it will pull on your heart strings. Rush and Watson are so terrific together and the three of them are the heart and soul of this movie. Nico Liersch is also excellent as Nelisse's best friend Rudy. Their friendship is beautiful and they have such great chemistry and just make you ache for them in their tragedies and the world they are growing up in. Their final scenes together are heart wrenching. Ben Schnetzer is a great addition as Max, the stowed away Jewish boy in their basement. His blossoming friendship with Nelisse is also wonderful to watch.I have nothing truly bad to say about this film and yet I can't score it more than I am. I don't know what it is but there wasn't anything truly mind blowing about this movie. I keep using the same positive words to describe it and I mean all of them but it is what it is. I can't help but wonder if the feeling of something missing in the movie comes from director Brian Percival who doesn't have a ton of experience and most of it is in TV. There isn't anything wrong with his direction I just wonder if maybe he doesn't quite have the experience to make this Spielberg Warhorse quality. The setting of the film is lovely and haunting, the architecture and the small village they live in. The story was eerily reminiscent of Canada's Anne of Green Gables with a world war 2 spin. Its a very different coming of age story to say the least. I also don't understand nor think it was necessary for the narration performed by Roger Allam. I sort of get what they were trying to do (and perhaps the book it is based on does the same) but Death narrating the story at awkward random moments seemed out of place and took you out of the story. Its still a must see film and won't take any awards this season but certainly one to watch for. 8.5/10",8,2,7,15 December 2013
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Breath taking, dark, disturbing and absolutely brilliant
","For all of Tim Burton's reputation Sweeney Todd would seem to be a given that he would be brilliant at doing and there is no doubt that Burton easily made this his own. Everything about Sweeney Todd is just brilliantly put together from the outstanding cast who aren't your typical stage singers, to the dark and gritty London, to the gruesome and completely gratuitous murders that Sweeney Todd hinges on. Its visually stunning, beautiful haunting music and a story that locks you into every moment. Burton holds nothing back from his dark side as he creates the ultimate in dark musicals. I admit I am a big musical fan but I think that's only because the ones I have seen, especially in 2007 and now this one, have been truly great. Sweeney Todd is unlike any other musical you will ever see. You can't really 'pick' a favorite song because the entire film nearly is sang...they run together and tell a story and yet has this incredible musical score that sticks with you. Its jaw dropping and shocking and all set to music. It could be described as a horror, a drama, a thriller, and a musical all into one. I have never seen Sweeney Todd on stage but this has to be the next best thing because Burton has created a masterpiece.Johnny Depp once again shows his incredible versatile talent as the emotionally deranged and wrongfully imprisoned Sweeney Todd who returns to London to exact revenge on those who wronged him. Depp is absolutely perfect and probably well deserving of an Oscar for this role. The thing is...he isn't a singer...as is the case with a lot of the cast but his performance is brilliant and no less astounding. He IS Sweeney Todd in every sense of the word and by no means he is a hero and yet you can't help but feel empathy and share his rage. Helena Bonham Carter is deliciously twisted and the eerie sidekick to Depp's Todd. Mrs. Lovett is just outright deranged and her and Depp have incredible chemistry and make an evil pairing right up there with Bonnie and Clyde. Her misplaced affections for Todd make for a twisted romance. Alan Rickman, as always, makes an incredible villain for Todd as the Judge who locked him away, killed his wife and took his daughter. Rickman hardly sings...in fact I thought he might be the only one who doesn't but he does eventually sing a song or two and he is the perfect addition to this cast. Timothy Spall also does an incredible job as Rickman's sleazy little sidekick. Jamie Campbell Bower is the pure balance to this deranged cast as the love sick sailor who wishes to save Johanna (Todd's daughter) from Rickman's grasp. He is good but doesn't stand out compared to the other performances. Honorable mention must be given to Ed Sanders in his premier performance as the young Toby who gives an earth moving performance and has this incredibly unique and strong singing voice. He is amazing and should have gotten a supporting actor nod for his small but significant role. Also a kudos to a cameo role by Sacha Baron Cohen as the conceited Barber on the road show. One of the best scenes in the film that you must see is the 'shave-off' between Depp's Sweeney Todd and Cohen's Signor Adolfo Pirelli.The gratuitous death scenes and blood spurting doesn't begin right away. In fact Burton and Depp do an incredible job at giving Todd this character arc that has him struggling with vengeance and sanity and dealing with Mrs. Lovett and her strange infatuation. You could watch Sweeney Todd again and again to see the incredible world that Burton creates. Whether its realistic or whether its the dirty, disgusting underbelly that Todd creates in his mind...its truly stunning on the big screen. Even if you're not a fan of musicals you can hardly take your eyes off Depp, and Carter, and Rickman and all the rest of the cast and everything going on. When the blood starts to flow there is no holds barred in some of the most disturbing and gruesome kills I have ever seen. And yet all this is done with some sort of grain of dark comedy which I believe only Burton could pull off. Slitting throats, dropping them violently onto the cement floor and clean up for the next one could only seem somehow darkly entertaining in a Tim Burton film. Regardless you must see this amazing film. 9/10",9,0,1,30 January 2008
Blades of Glory," Dear Lord...it was actually good!!
","Will Ferrell and I have had a tumultuous relationship. Ever since leaving live skit comedy Ferrell has tried far too hard and always makes the films he's in feel like it should be a 3 minute skit and not a 2 hour movie. There are a few exception but I found his creation of the 'Will Ferrell Comedy Troupe' (Wilson, Stiller, Carell, Rudd) as I call them...more annoying than anything. Anchorman...horrendous....BeWitched...disastrous...Talladega Nights...I could go on. And then every once in awhile he stumbles upon a script that actually suits him and I think it's more complete accident than anything else. Blades of Glory has everything you could want from a slapstick, spoof-like film and it actually all works pretty well together. The idea of it being centered around figure skating immediately makes the premise humorous because if two guys looked less like Figure Skating champions it would be Ferrell and Heder. Add in some great cameos and supporting roles and you've got a brainless and yet laugh out loud good time.One of the surprising aspects of Blades of Glory is that the two stars share equal time and equal roles despite Ferrell being the bigger of the two stars. Will Ferrell plays overly confident, sexaholic skating star Chazz Michael Michaels. As usual with Ferrell his performance is overblown and as much a farce character as you can get and yet for some reason this time it works. As dumb and idiotic as his character is you actually enjoy him and he has some genuinely funny moments...one of my favorites is his performance on the treadmill as he sings 'My Humps' and has bread rolls thrown at him by Heder. I can honestly say this is one performance of Ferrell's that I had no problem watching. Part of that I attribute to his co-star Jon Heder who has done a great job pulling himself away from the stereotype of Napoleon Dynamite that made him a star. Granted his performances aren't a far stretch from Napoleon but even still he's lovable and watchable and always manages to be the guy you root for. Heder and Ferrell have great chemistry together and Heder doesn't let Ferrell overshadow him which makes for a great picture. Will Arnett and Amy Poehler play their skating adversaries, the devious and disgusting siblings the Van Waldenbergs. They are used sparingly making their performance funny without being overdone. Everyone is used in light moderation and that's the beauty of this comedy is that it's not TOO MUCH but just enough to make it hilarious. Jenna Fischer is very good as Heder's love interest, and Craig T. Nelson is terrific as the straight man to Heder and Ferrell and they all mesh very well together.The co-directing team of Will Speck and Josh Gordon seem to really nail how the film needs to fit together. It's not one of the funniest films I've ever seen but it's definitely worth seeing and you can't help but get a few good howls out of it. This entire review is coming from someone who hates spoof movies and overall has never liked Will Ferrell but after seeing this I might be more likely to give him a bigger chance next time around. I think the key to surviving a Ferrell movie is the right director and script and being able to control his off the wall, over exaggerated humor and it just so happens that Blades of Glory does exactly that. 8/10",8,0,0,6 May 2007
Horrible Bosses," A fun dark comedy that gives you what you'd expect
","Horrible Bosses is exactly what it looks like it would be. No more and no less and there is nothing wrong with that. Its hard to make a flat out slapstick comedy about murder but they do pull it off and while some of the laughs and gags are distinctly dark and disturbing you will laugh a lot, there is no doubt about it. Ironically it isn't the main cast which will have you in stitches but rather the bosses themselves. Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudekis are all good but they don't really stand out as the ones delivering the comedy in the movie. They all have good chemistry together and deliver the story well. This movie shines when it comes to Kevin Spacey who delivers a dark, twisted, spiteful performance as Bateman's boss, and Colin Farrell as the dim witted, angry boss to Sudekis. Some of Farrell's one liners are just classic and you'll be spouting them to your friend's for weeks. Jennifer Aniston is also good as the sex crazed Dentist and boss to Day but she wasn't my favorite. I thought she was rather darkly disturbing even too much for this film and just didn't much care for her character. Jamie Foxx is sadly underused but has a great small role as the killer for hire that wants to teach them to kill their bosses. This is definitely a dark comedy but its also laugh out loud at the same time and the way the movie comes together and ends is actually very funny and outlandish at the same time. Director Seth Gordon comes from some very funny Television and that comedy carries over to Horrible Bosses which is great fun, maybe not outstanding but still all around fun to watch. 7/10",7,2,5,1 January 2012
The Polar Express," The most unique film of the year
","The Polar Express could probably be debated about for a good long time. Funny for an animated Christmas film!! Robert Zemeckis is not new to the idea of a unique film idea. I mean Zemeckis is a master director. He's the mastermind behind The Back To The Future series, three of the best films ever made. But granted this is new territory for him and yet he takes it and makes it his own. Zemeckis and superstar Tom Hanks team up again (the first time being the over rated but not bad film Castaway.) This film puts the final nail in the sign that reads 'TOM HANKS MOST TALENTED ENTERTAINER ALIVE.' There is nothing this man can't do or make us believe or act his way into. This is no exception, animated or otherwise. The film is about a young boy who is reaching that age where you start to realize that perhaps there is no Santa Clause. He is looking into the cold hard facts of the idea of Santa Clause and he's coming up with the realization it doesn't exist. The night of Christmas Eve when everyone else has gone to bed, the young boy stumbles outside of his house and smack into an enormous steam engine. The conductor steps down and invites him onboard to The Polar Express...the train that goes to the North Pole. The boy journey's through treacherous mountains and landscape, meets some other children who become good friends, and finally arrives in The North Pole to meet with Santa Clause himself and receive the first Christmas Present of the year. Story sounds pretty straight forward doesn't it? Nothing overly unique about that? The uniqueness comes from several things. The first is the graphics. The computer animation is brilliant, stunning, beautiful, and jaw dropping. The movements of each character are just flawless and captivating, you can't take your eyes away. The voice overs are so immaculate and Tom Hanks as several different characters breathes incredibly personality into them specifically the train conductor who is a mysterious, yet fun character to enjoy. He's protective of the children but by the book running his train. The actual film making is the key here though. If this were not a Christmas film with a lesson behind it to learn it would almost be too scary for children, it would almost be downright frightful to them. These kids have a harrowing journey through the frozen tundra, there are some extremely nail biting moments. The landscape, Christmas town, and everything in this film is just hauntingly beautiful and a little scary at times. It's different than anything I've ever seen in a film. Even Santa's elves come across as strange and scary at times. I don't think there is anything wrong with this new twist on the Christmas story. Certainly scare tactics are not new to a Christmas story. Take A Christmas Carol for example, almost a horror story at times. The Grinch, and other stories like that. But this story goes even deeper into an underworld of Christmas. One of Hank's characters in the film is a train jumping hobo who helps our hero several times but only to disappear in the snow like a Ghost. It never explains who he is, why he's there or whether or not he is actually a Ghost. The musical score for the film is also beautiful although perhaps only slightly overused at times. As I first began watching the film I thought of what a wonderful achievement it would have been to see this film in live action but as it continued I realized that it's whole heart is in the animation of it. They set up Santa Clause as this hero, a larger than life persona that for the most part we have forgotten about because he has become such an icon of Christmas. The beautiful Christmas music, the original score, the animation, the incredibly story, the action and nail biting sequences, the lovely Christmas lessons learned and the amazing acting voice overs by Hanks this film is timeless and finally a classic worthy of keeping around. I will add this to my Christmas viewing list every year!!! Although short, the film is wonderful for anyone. I insist everyone sees this Christmas classic. If your children are young, be prepared for a little scare but I think they will grow to love it!! I hope this film gets some Academy attention of some sort. 9/10",Null,1,4,22 November 2004
Nacho Libre," As dumb and useless as it looks...a complete disappointment
","I don't know what I expected from Nacho Libre. I was not a huge fan of the enormously successful cult classic Napoleon Dynamite but I love Jack Black's comedy and I knew it would be dumb but it could still be funny. Unfortunately Nacho Libre is only one thing...BORING...flat out boring with gags and jokes that are so stale they stink and a story that is just plain boring.One thing for sure is I don't blame Jack Black. I think Black is a brilliant comedian. He can do physical comedy like nobody else, he loves to poke fun at himself, he's an average joe who just likes to act crazy and usually that's fun to watch. School of Rock was just hilarious but the story was solid. Black was equally hilarious in the very under rated High Fidelity. I think he has a great career ahead of him in comedy, maybe even drama (he was very good in King Kong.) He can be a leading man. He is the one redeemable aspect of this film. If someone else had starred...I might have walked out...and I never do. Ana de la Reguera plays Jack Blacks'...obsession I suppose?? He is a priest and she is a nun so I can't exactly say love interest because there isn't any actual romance between them. She is very placid, a little boring, bears a striking resemblance to Penelope Cruz but does little to nothing besides be eye candy in a nun's outfit. Héctor Jiménez actually does a pretty decent job as Jack Black's tag team partner Esqueleto. He does some really good physical comedy and plays a great straight man to Blacks' comedy routine but even still the story stinks so bad. There really isn't any other characters to mention.Co-writer and director Jared Hess' idea of humor is way out there and completely off kilter. His idea of funny is being as dull and stupid as you can be which seems to work for everyone who thinks Napoleon Dynamite (also his baby) was hilarious. I guess I don't find stupidity all that funny. I won't completely crap on the film. I will say I was very impressed that you could actually take your kids to this film. There wasn't a stick of bad language, or incredibly inappropriate humor, it was actually pretty family friendly...too bad it would put them to sleep. They also felt the need to throw in the even stupider fart jokes which felt as out of place as passing gas would in a church. The wrestling scenes are funny but very, very predictable and same old when it comes to stunts and funny scenes in the ring. The single ONLY funny part was Jack Black singing a song...the man is hilarious when he sings. He should have skipped this absolute STINKER and made School of Rock 2. Then again the film is doing well and likely will continue. Everyone else in the theater seemed to be laughing insanely and I thought it was just plain dumb...drier than the Mexican desert it took place in. And for ALL the reviewers and critics and people who post online saying the film is racist...I wouldn't even worry about it. It's as racist as Napoleon Dynamite was to white people. Sure it portrays Mexicans as poor and rather foolish but then it also portrays everyone in the film as poor and stupid. It's not even campy, it must have cost them 10$ to make except for Blacks' salary. Skip this one altogether and see a better comedy...or see it and prepare to have a nap. 4/10",4,5,11,20 June 2006
The Town," Well made, stylish crime caper with a great cast
","The Town seems to be highly appreciated, well received film by critics and movie goers a like. It has received some awards although the main awards have only gone to Jeremy Renner as he is a critic favourite since his turn in The Hurt Locker. I think where The Town is successful is that it appeals to the main stream action thriller audience but also has a powerful cast, great performances, a lot of depth and something critics can sink their teeth into and that isn't an easy feat. The film focuses on anti-heroes and you will root for the bad guy despite yourself. Boston, of course, plays a huge part in the film as the entire back drop and makes you feel like you are right there with them feeling the adrenaline of the robberies and the intensity of being chased. Part mystery, part action, part thriller and with a dash of drama it is one of those films that has a little of everything to please everyone. However strange the romance in the film is, it still plays itself out throughout the film.Ben Affleck directs and stars in the film proving he still has a lot of talent left in a career some were surmising was washed up. Affleck's Doug is a powerful character that is both a bad-ass villain and an anti-hero at the same time. His character has a lot of layers and definitely easy to watch. Jeremy Renner makes Affleck's character look like a hero. Renner's 'Jem' is twisted and disturbed and really creepy. He is the perfect villain to the entire story. Renner and Affleck have a palpable chemistry. Rebecca Hall is decent as the bank manager who is victimized unknowingly by Affleck's crew and then begins a relationship with Affleck. Her character is a little less interesting as the male cast, she is more means to an end as far as Affleck's character goes but she does well and has good chemistry with Affleck. I've never found Jon Hamm to be a very versatile actor but the role of business man or in this case a determined FBI Agent fits him very well because he is an intensity about him. The great character actor Pete Postlethwaite is excellent as the mobster of the film. Every scene he is in is terrific and its unfortunate he isn't used more. Another great character actor Chris Cooper has a good cameo as Affleck's father although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.Say what you will about Ben Affleck's career but as a director and as an actor he has proved he knows how to show some intensity. His previous directorial Gone Baby Gone showed some really great intensity and now this film proves he can direct great action as well. He has a passion for films and sometimes it works and sometimes he stumbles but as long as he keeps finding or making films like The Town he will be the star he deserves to be. To top off the trifecta he also co-wrote The Town ensuring that everything happens the way he wants it to. He knows what people like at the movies and action thriller fans will love The Town. Although it easily fits into the crime caper genre it doesn't feel like a re-hash of other similar films like Heat for instance. The Town stands on its own and is well worth seeing! 8.5/10",8,1,2,22 February 2011
Closer," Academy Award MUST!! (of course because it's typical)
","This is the prime example of all things artsy with Mike Nichols' Closer. This seems like the mould for Academy films and the artsy crowd. No that doesn't make it a bad film, it just makes it exclusively enjoyed by a minority of film goers.Closer is about...well it's hard to tell what it's about...it's pretty mish mashed and out there which is a usual characteristic of artsy type films. But basically Closer is about four people of different walks of life, a doctor, a photographer, a stripper, and a writer. Together their lives and love lives and unique personalities become entwined over a long period of time.The period of time is quite unknown because the film moves at a silent pace...meaning they don't make it clear when they are jumping ahead a month, 3 months, 4 years...whatever they happen to be doing. You do follow the plot fairly easily and they try to let you know where they are in the timeline but if you don't know ahead of time that the film will not all take place during one time frame, you'll be initially confused. The cast is stellar, amazing in fact. Natalie Portman proves her acting chops which is long overdue and Jude Law is his usual portrayal which happens to work well here. Julia Roberts supports everyone else as the quiet link between them all. And nominee Clive Owen is brilliantly emotional and firey and he makes the film worth watching.Patrick Marber who wrote the play and script tries to capture human condition when it comes to love and sex and honesty. There definitely is something here worth researching because all four people have this view on these subjects that effect those around them. They are all self involved and self concerned. The dialogue is very quick witted and most of the conversation between any two of the characters if a firing of constant questions which leaves you feeling muddled and perplexed which I think is what it is supposed to do, they want you to feel like you're in their situation. I also think in my opinion that the film is aiming to show a total cycle of different relationships but on a fast track over the course of 4 years. Basically they are showing human relationships on fast forward, but that's just my opinion. If you want an artsy film with Hollywood stars this is one of the better ones. I'm sure it will take some award, somewhere.6/10",6,1,2,4 February 2005
Elf," Ferrell finally finds something to contain him
","I do love Christmas movies, always a sucker for them even if the style and story is not new or different. Elf does bring some new story to the typical Christmas movie but for the most part it's same old, same old which for someone who loves the Christmas movie is great!! Unfortunately I am not a fan of Will Ferrell, okay granted I thought Night At The Roxbury was pretty funny but everything else since then has been horrid. Nonetheless with Elf Ferrell finally finds something that suits his completely child like annoying behavior and his over acting actually suits the character.Elf is the story of an orphan who accidentally makes his way into Santa's magical bag on Christmas Eve as a baby. When Santa discovers him he puts him in the care of the elves, in particular Papa Elf. The elves raise him as one of their own despite his size difference and a few other more human traits he is raised to believe he is just another Elf. Buddy as he is known has now reached the age that Papa Elf believes he should know the truth, especially considering that Buddy has a real father, alive and well who didn't even know he existed. Buddy is excited about making his way to New York City to meet his real father. He travels from the safe land of The North Pole where he knows and understands everything into the brutal modern world of New York City. Buddy sticks out like a sore thumb, and not just because of his green elf costume he insists on wearing but his politeness, his fascination with the simple annoyances of life, and his insistence that he is truly an elf from the North Pole. He finally tracks down his real father, Walter, a big time children's book publicist who spends more time working than with his wife and other son. Buddy tries to explain that he is Walter's son but Walter has him removed from the building. After being kicked out Buddy meets a friend in Jovie, a rather down on her luck Gimble's worker who plays an Elf for the Christmas season. Although first rather nervous about Buddy she begins to warm up to his childlike innocence. Buddy continues to do all he can to get back to see his Dad and eventually with a blood test Walter discovers this rather imbalanced man is indeed his son. Walter's wife Emily insists that Buddy stay with him. Buddy does everything he can to spread Christmas cheer and turn everything more 'Christmas-y' wherever he goes. Unfortunately his ignorance to the real world infuriates Walter and he just wants Buddy to go away but both his wife and other son have become very attached to Buddy. Buddy tries his hand at working with Walter, which causes disaster, and eventually Buddy finds himself all alone until Santa has a bit of a disaster himself and crashes the sleigh into Central Park. The sleigh won't fly because their is no Christmas spirit left. Fortunately Buddy has touched enough people's lives for Jovie and Emily and Michael to bring Christmas spirit back for everyone including Walter who finally realizes what is important. Buddy will save Christmas for everyone!! Buddy is a great Christmas character. His naivety and ignorance is funny but touching and cute. Ferrell actually does manage to pull that off thank goodness. Although I don't know if they make Buddy pure enough that it actually comes across that he is touching these people's lives. The real laughs are with the physical comedy in the film, mostly entirely done by Ferrell but it's very funny. James Caan is so out of place and yet so perfect for the role of Walter. He fits in but doesn't at all which is kind of strange. Bob Newhart as the narrator and Papa Elf is also a great little cameo. And the great Ed Asner as bit rough around the edges but very caring Santa is also great. Zooey Deschanel as Buddy's love interest Jovie is a good choice. Although at first she doesn't seem like the right pick they actually have decent chemistry and she plays her role with a lot of depth for the short time she gets. Director Jon Favreau does a good job of creating something I actually compared to the amazing classic Miracle on 34th Street. Much of this film reminded me of a more updated modern version of that film which is a great honor. While I don't think Elf has the staying power it's still a cute little Christmas film with a tolerable Will Ferrell and a good family film. Pick it up this Christmas or even if you just feel like being in the Christmas Spirit. 8.5/10",8,9,13,8 August 2005
Taxi Driver," A depressing and captivating look at the underbelly of the world
","I wasn't sure how I would take to Taxi Driver. I have come to love Robert Deniro as an actor, and I've always been kind of indifferent towards the iconic Martin Scorsese although I have not seen a lot of his stuff...some of it I hated and some of it I respected. Plus Taxi Driver is no doubt a cinema classic and I needed to see it. It started out a little slow and I was beginning to think that this would be another over rated classic and then the magic of Taxi Driver started to work. It's the kind of film that is really stealthy because it starts to grow on you and really sucks you into the dark and disturbing world. The film really depressing and dark and the story really has a haunting tone and it slowly starts to really move you and suck you into the world of this depressed, insomniac loner who is basically having a quarter life crisis. He's late twenties, feels like he has no direction, can't sleep, is not well educated, angry, and wants to make a difference in the world. He has no social skills to speak of and really has this passion to change someone no matter what. Really the film lies in the hands of the taxi driver and the actor that portrays him and that is quite simply what made the film and the actor famous forever.Robert Deniro stars as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam vet who fits everything I just explained above but you need to see his performance to understand. This film is of course the original source for Deniro's infamous '...you talking to me?' Bickle is just a character full of empathy and you can't help but feel for him and really get drawn into his slightly twisted mind. He has such depth and emotion to his character, some more subtle than others. He is brilliant and this is almost a one man show on his part as he drives his cab from situation to situation. Cybill Shepherd is okay in a fairly small role as the object of Deniro's rather twisted fascination. The two of them clash and it adds something to Deniro's story but she doesn't really impress. A very young Jodie Foster post Disney movies plays an underage hooker of all things and she gets a lot of acclaim for this movie and I think it is credited as hoisting her out of child actor and into the role of adult actor. I think she is a little over credited for the role because it's quite small BUT she is excellent in it. Her role is also very dark and disturbing and her and Deniro have great chemistry. Harvey Keitel is terrific in a small role as well, as Foster's pimp and disturbing love interest 'Sport.' Also watch for great supporting roles by Peter Boyle, and Albert Brooks.I can't stress enough how dark this movie is. I mean in a way it's like there is this ray of light throughout the whole film and remarkably after everything that happens the film gets a happy ending?! I never saw that coming at all and it made the film even better. The last five or ten minutes of the film is an absolute blood bath like Scorsese likes to do but everything fits together and it just happens to work like magic. It might be the most depressing film I've ever seen and yet everything works out which makes it truly a feel good film in many ways. There is so much to ask yourself when the credits role and there is no doubt in my mind why this film has become timeless because it could be watched again and again just to get a feel for the character and everything involved. I can't recommend this enough for anyone who wants a truly intelligent, deeply moving film. You can't be disappointed with it. 9/10 (Probably should be a 10/10 but after a few more views perhaps?)",9,1,2,21 April 2008
Shutter Island," A solid thriller if not a little over rated. The twist isn't truly so twisty
","Everyone I ever spoke to that had seen Shutter Island raved about it. I don't disagree that the film was very entertaining and a solid thriller but I felt like maybe people saw more originality in it than I did. It was well worth seeing and impressed me so don't get me wrong but it wasn't a mind blowing Scorsese classic in my opinion. In fact I think this was one of Scorsese's more mainstream films, although I've never really seen him as the 'amazing' 'monster' director everyone else does. I usually find he tries too hard to be unique. Still Shutter Island's creepy setting, and isolated prison is very well done and keeps you enthralled. The entire film happens on Shutter Island but you won't soon be tired of the setting as it takes the lead character from the prison like rooms to the coast of the island and back. Add in the time period of the mid fifties, and then toss a Hurricane at the Island to boot and you have the perfect suspense thriller setting to keep things moving. But by the time you add some of these key features it might start to feel a little predictable which you don't really expect from the film or from Scorsese. You can say a lot about him but predictable isn't usually his alma mater.Leonardo DiCaprio, who truly impressed in Scorsese's previous smash success The Departed (see my review), and is great in his role as U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels. You very quickly realize that something far more sinister is at work through the eyes of DiCaprio. Despite a solid supporting cast the film does really revolve around him and if anything you can say that DiCaprio can carry a film. He is very watchable and always gives a roll his all and makes everything seem mysterious in the film. Mark Ruffalo plays DiCaprio's new partner and right off the bat his vibe is one of mystery. Ruffalo has really honed his acting skill over the years because I used to find him downright dull but he really is showing some spirit. He plays a great role and has solid chemistry opposite DiCaprio. A master of his craft Ben Kingsley seems like the ideal choice for Shutter Island lead doctor Dr. Cawley. And indeed he is however somehow I expected for maniacal behaviour from him. But in essence that does defeat the purpose of the story. Kingsley gives a solid very interesting performance. On top of that the amazing Max von Sydow plays Kingsley's partner in a small but very effectively disturbing role. John Carroll Lynch has a small role as well but is really excellent as the Deputy for the Island. In fact I would have liked to have seen him more in the film.Shutter Island's big hook is the twist to the whole story and the unravelling of the mystery. My issue is that the final solution is really a bit predictable and not very exciting. I don't consider myself very smart when it comes to solving cinematic mysteries but I think I had it all figured out by the time the ending rolled. I don't know what I wanted from the ending but with the set up and the creepy atmosphere of Shutter Island I guess I felt a little bit let down. With that aside you won't be disappointed in seeing Shutter Island. Maybe I had high expectations given how many people raved about the film. If you're looking for a solid thriller or even something with a dash of horror film then you won't be disappointed with Shutter Island. 8/10",8,2,4,8 July 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Marvel continues to create a world so depthy they may not like hitting bottom
","My title might sound ambiguous as to whether I enjoyed this film or not well let me assure you that I did. I have such a great amount of respect for Marvel/Disney and what they've done with this Superhero Universe. It is so diverse and instead of bottoming out with each film they release they seem to continue to set the bar and open up new avenues in this world. Captain America: Winter Soldier serves to do exactly that...add layers and layers to the Avengers world. This is both its success and its curse. At times Captain America: Winter Soldier feels like an epilogue unlike Thor 2 which stood firmly on its own two feet. It does attempt to create its own story while making sure to fast track the Avengers storyline but even the main story is really just more for The Avengers to cover in Age of Ultron. This isn't a bad thing, it just means that Captain America: Winter Soldier doesn't stand out very well on its own. There is a myriad of terrific action scenes, apparently done with minimal CGI and I LOVE that!! The hand to hand combat scenes are plentiful and really well choreographed. Then there is a ton of story development, thrills and twists and turns (some are a little obvious I think) but the comparisons to the spy/thriller genre are apparent. This, again, is both its curse and success. Sometimes it felt like it dragged just a little bit and when you go into Captain America you aren't necessarily prepared to see a thriller with a lot of story. Its all very well done, please don't get me wrong, it just is a little off-putting after seeing the non-stop thrill ride that was Thor 2.I have always liked Chris Evans but I wasn't he would make the right Captain America. I was completely wrong and he proves it again for a third go around. He embodies the innocence and morality and yet is tough as nails as a soldier. Evans actually gets to demonstrate a lot of depth for an action hero and he does so well. He is perfect in the role and it would be hard for anyone to take that role from him. Scarlett Johansson returns as everyone's favourite gorgeous Russian spy. Johansson really gets a significant role for the first time is basically a co-star to the story. Her chemistry with Evans is near perfect and their potential romance is well dealt with without getting in the way. I was never sure I was a huge fan of Black Widow in these films but she really won me over in this. The supporting cast in this film was what really won me over. There were some truly great characters and performances. Of course you have Samuel L. Jackson playing a significant role as Nick Fury and he's good in the role but man are we finally being over saturated with Jackson? He does so much and his twist in the film I could have seen from a mile away. Robert Redford as Alexander Pierce is a subtle performance and he does seem to be showing his age but this guy is Hollywood royalty in my books and he instantly adds to any scene he is in and he fits the cast very well. Anthony Mackie is a great addition to the cast if not slightly underused but I would hazard to guess they are establishing a character for future films. Same for Emily VanCamp who has a good role and I love her as an actress but she is underdeveloped in this film but establishes her for future films. In my opinion the films biggest flaw is its villain. The entire concept of this movie should be 'The Winter Soldier' played by Sebastian Stan. His origin is not really a surprise but they do their best to make it seem that way. Stan is a decent villain with some good scenes but just when he's getting his bad-ass vibe in check he vanishes and you're left feeling underwhelmed by the villain. It plays into the fact that Captain America: Winter Soldier is more of a bridge between Avengers films than its own entity.I'm more than surprised that Marvel and/or Disney turned to the Russo brothers for direction. I don't mean to imply they did a bad job, this is a very good movie but the Marvel bar is so high with Iron Man 1 and 2, The Avengers and Thor 2 (I left out Iron Man 3 because it, like this, felt just a little underwhelming.) Anything less than a 9 to me has to be dissected when it comes to Marvel films. The Russo brothers have a long history of experience in Television and when you're making a film like this it needs to be self-contained while still propelling the Marvel Universe. All that aside you won't be disappointed. The film absolutely has a different vibe which they were aiming for and they throw around '70's thriller' a lot and I can see that homage to it and bravo to them for that. It properly captures Captain America and what he stands for. Everyone is raving and it will make a ton of money and for good reason. It isn't perfect nor is it high on the list of what they've produced thus far but it is a great start to the blockbuster season and a fun time at the movies. 8/10",8,3,7,20 April 2014
Life of Pi," Breathtaking, beautiful, symbolic and very deep
","The trailers I saw for Life of Pi did nothing to explain what the movie was at all and I had not read the book nor heard of it. But I decided to give it a try. I don't like 3D, never have, it's always unimpressive. Well guess what? Ang Lee did it. I saw this in 3D and it literally is the first 3D film that made me go WOW!! The visuals are just absolutely amazing, some of the best effects I have ever seen. Fortunately this is not where the films ends it impressive streak. The story is just lovely, riveting, and so emotionally and spiritually deep. A philosophy class could talk about this movie for an entire year and still have more to say. The film doesn't even begin to try to give you a philosophy or way of life but rather is all about exploring the world and exploring the philosophies of life. As a lover of animals you will look for how all the animals in the film play a role but there are truly just animals and important lessons are learned through them. It was perhaps one of the most symbolic and deeply philosophical films I have ever seen and because of that it was incredibly entertaining and beautifully shot.While a few actors play Pi throughout various stages of his life, only one leaves an indelible and brilliant impression. Suraj Sharma at least deserves an Oscar nomination for making you feel so connected to him and displaying a brilliant display of courage and depth to his character. While he doesn't get as much screen time Irrfan Khan puts incredible emotion into his performance as adult Pi. Both Sharma and Khan bring to life a great adventurer and philosopher in the form of Pi. The supporting cast performs their parts perfectly. No one person really stands out because their goal it to get Pi into his adventure but they are still great. Adil Hussain and and Tabu are particularly good as Pi's parents.Ang Lee without a doubt must receive an Oscar nod for this film. The cinematography, the special effects, and most importantly the use of those special effects are nothing short of revolutionary. The animals are so brilliantly done and the character of the tiger (Richard Parker...love how he got his name too) is so vital to the entire story and by the time the film ends you will ache for the tiger as much as Pi does so you will feel his emotions. The film won't be for everyone. Certainly its just too intense for children with a lot of animal deaths and I can see the mainstream movie goers accusing it of being 'slow' or 'boring' but for anyone looking for something unique and outstanding, Life of Pi is it. I hope the critics feel the same way because this one is a home run in my books!! 9/10",9,17,34,23 November 2012
Over the Top," Bring on the haters because I have always, and still love this movie
","Another reviewer said this about 'Over The Top', its impossible not to like it. Unfortunately that's not true because even Sylvester Stallone has expressed his disappointment in this film, however I agree with that reviewer!! For me, personally, there is nothing but fun and good memories watching Over The Top. When I was in my early teens discovering Stallone for the first time (he's an icon to me now) this was one of the movies I discovered and fell in love with. It's cheesy and melodramatic and silly and so chock full of 80's Goodness that it seeps with everything I love about a great 80's film. Its also fun and sweet with a good story, great characters and good action (albeit sometimes misplaced action scenes.) I suppose I am simply biased in reviewing this because it is one of those movies from my childhood that I just can't say anything bad about. Stallone being who he is, its inevitable that they would have to put some sort of action scenes in place. Something about him driving his enormous transport through the front gate of his rich father-in-law's mansion and tossing a guy through a plate glass window doesn't exactly fit in with the feel of the film and yet it works because he's Stallone. Inevitable comparisons to Rocky are warranted as this is a terrific underdog story which Stallone is perfect for.Sylvester Stallone is a love him or hate him kind of actor. I love him! His charisma is undeniable and his quiet determined but fallible Lincoln Hawk is a great character. He is far from perfect but trying to make amends and has this solid determination that is endearing. David Mendenhall is just nearly the perfect 80's kid. He is spoiled and bratty but you root for him to come around and connect with his father. His acting ability isn't perfect but for this type of movie he fits it so well. The chemistry between him and Stallone is surprisingly spot on. I would consider Robert Loggia a terrific character actor. He has been in some phenomenal and classic films. He is perfect in this movie as the overbearing and demanding rich Grandfather. He is the perfect adversary for Hawk and the only problem is there isn't enough of him. He's actually underused in many ways. Rick Zumwalt is the brutish, muscle bound arm wrestling champion. He is okay but he really is just the muscle that Stallone has to beat without any real character behind him. He's like a wrestler and he's there to look menacing and larger than life and he does that well.Menahem Golan churned out movies like few other directors. He is like the king of B-Action flicks. You would probably not even recognize any of them. Still he clearly knows the cookie cutter recipe for making an 80's flick. He knew his demographic and he knew who he was working with (rumour has it that he just kept offering Stallone more and more money until he said yes) and he doesn't pretend that Over The Top is anything more than it is. Its not pretentious and doesn't try to shove the story down your throat. It is a simple, fun, sweet movie that is ultimately very uplifted. And the soundtrack...is there literally another 80's movie that just reeks of 80's music like this one? Its all original music for the film and it is literally quintessential 80's. Meet Me Halfway by Kenny Loggins has gotta be one of the greatest 80's theme songs in the world and it nearly chokes me up every time I hear it. It is absolutely true that this film is overly sentimental to me so I am probably reviewing it better than what it might actually be to most. But I simply can't deny the sweet and fun quality of the film. I recommend it to everyone, especially Stallone fans because it has so much heart. Plenty of action and the arm wrestling just makes it even more fun. You can't go in expecting an Oscar worthy classic but just sit back and enjoy because it is simply fun. 9/10",9,4,4,26 June 2013
Ocean's Thirteen," Going back to it's roots Ocean's 13 makes the trilogy worth while
","Ocean's 11 was not the type of film to warrant a sequel but given the pure fun the original crew had it only made sense that they'd come back to do it again. But a third installment seemed almost mundane. How could they possibly make a third installment worth while?? Well they get continued points for once again bringing back the majority of the original cast minus almost all estrogen (Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, and pretty much any females at all.) But the core cast is back and after the rather disastrous mess of Ocean's 12 which took the heart of the film away by setting it outside of Vegas they manage to go back to what made the original film great...big Hollywood stars, having a good time, in Vegas, pulling the con of a life time and that makes Ocean's 13 worth while and stunningly saves the series. Steven Soderbergh returns for a third time as director and I think by now the entire cast should just know each other and how the script works. Granted Ocean's 13 isn't exactly a huge stretch from what was already Ocean's 11 and I'll still stand by the fact that I don't a trilogy was necessary but as luck would have it Ocean's 13 is actually very watchable and a lot of fun.George Clooney returns as the head of the crew...Danny Ocean. He definitely recaptures more of that suave, smooth, and cunning Danny Ocean from the original that was completely lost with the second. Working by his side again is his crew that all have a purpose again this time around. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Shaobo Qin, Carl Reiner, and Eddie Jemison. In the original their purpose was clear cut and exact and in Ocean's 12 there was no need for half of them and finally with Ocean's 13 most of them have a very important role even if it feels a little forced at times. Most of all they just want to be there to help avenge Reuben, played again by the terrific Elliot Gould. They even found a way to bring back Andy Garcia in a small role as Ocean's number one adversary Terry Benedict. The addition to this cast was the irreplaceable and incredible Al Pacino as Willie Bank, the tough as nails, egotistical scum bag casino owner who screws over Reuben (Gould.) Pacino just ups the ante on any cast and he fits right in with the Ocean's team. The only female to the cast is that of Ellen Barkin as Pacino's right hand gal Abigail Sponder. She is supposed to be tough and ruthless but in fact she comes across as mostly whiny and annoying and gets in the way so she doesn't really fill the shoes well of Roberts or Zeta Jones.I give great credit to Soderbergh and the writers of Ocean's 13 because they came up with a really good and interesting and fun concept as opposed to simply 'yet another heist.' The whole unique plot to the team was what made this film different from Ocean's 11 and watchable...again. Still it was far from perfect and at this point so much of it just seemed forced and unnecessary and for the love of Ocean please stop it at a trilogy because there is nothing more that can be milked out of these characters. Danny Ocean on his own?? Perhaps but not the 11, or 12, or 13...this series has definitely played it's course. But if you're a fan of the original Clooney version than you need to definitely see Ocean's 13 because of the two sequels this one is heads and tails above Ocean's 12. 7.5/10",7,0,2,30 June 2007
Tangled," God Bless Disney. How do they keep doing this year after year, creating absolute classics!
","Like any child I loved Disney films and I turned into an adult that adores the classic Disney films and hope to share them with my children one day. But could they keep creating the classic films we all know and love from Snow White and Bambi to modern day classics like Aladdin and Beauty and The Beast? Well the answer is absolutely!! Tangled is the first Disney animation film I have seen in quite some time and I was glued to my screen the whole time. Funny, cute, romantic, thrilling, adventurous, edge of your seat, and stunningly beautifully animated and this only begins to describe Tangled. I saw elements of Aladdin, Beauty and The Beast, and even The Lion King in the style, story and characters the film makers created. Like many Disney films it draws on a classic fairy tale and brings those characters to life in such a larger than life way. I saw Tangled on Blu Ray which certainly helps the quality but throughout the film I couldn't stop being awestruck over the quality of the animation. I believe it is traditional hand drawn animation but just...wow...from Rapunzel's doll like features, to the breath taking Kingdom they live in. Kids will adore it and adults will never take their eyes off of it.Zachary Levi is already high up on my hero list as I am a huge Chuck fan and recognized his voice immediately. But regardless of this his voice talents to the egotistical, romantic thief Flynn Rider is just perfect. As much of a fan of his that I am I forgot about him and he simply became Flynn Rider to me and that says a lot. Mandy Moore seems to have slipped out of the spotlight lately. But she comes back strong as the naive, lovely, young girl Rapunzel with the magnificent hair. I wasn't sure about her voice at first but she is perfect and their voices come together to create a terrific chemistry opposite each other. Donna Murphy plays the voice of the obligatory 'witch' or evil 'step mother' as the case may be. Murphy is a terrific character actor and has been for years and she is perfect behind the face of Rapunzel's captor. And of course any great Disney film needs a handful of talented supporting voices and they include Ron Perlman, M.C. Gainey, Jeffrey Tambor, and Brad Garrett to name a few of the more well known and noticeable performances.Only Disney can create characters like this. Other film making companies make good animation but does anyone even touch these guys? This film packs so much adventure into one movie just like you'd expect and demand from a Disney flick. There has to be a 'but' since I didn't score it a perfect ten and that 'but' happens to be something that is also a Disney staple and that is the music. I didn't think the music in Tangled was very impressive at all. The best song was the song in the tavern with all the brutes because it was fun and light hearted but none of the songs stayed with me or stuck in my head and I am certain there won't really be any songs that become classics. So its unfortunate that the music stumbles but everything else about this amazing film makes up for it. Constant adventure!! Boys, girls, men and women will find something they love about it. There are some definite dark turns in the film especially near the end where our hero Flynn is stabbed...so be warned with the really little ones but otherwise Disney swings and knocks another one way, way way out of the park. I LOVE IT!! 9/10",9,2,4,28 March 2011
Interstellar," This is either sci-fi brilliance or a melodramatic self-promotion...I'm on the fence
","Do you remember when Chris Nolan wasn't CHRIS NOLAN!! Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were amazing examples of redefining old material and creating a world as profoundly unique as Tim Burton did in the 90's. Memento and Inception are two of the smartest, most profound films I have ever seen. But what happened with the Dark Knight Trilogy is Nolan had been stroked so much that he thinks he can do anything. He thinks everything he touches is gold and that isn't quite true. Now all that being said I am so completely confused as to whether Interstellar is yet another example of his sheer brilliance as a film maker and creative mind or if its just him thinking he's great and carbon copying other material to make some sort of deeply profound sci-fi films. It did definitely have some plot holes (though not nearly to the extent of The Dark Knight Rises or Man Of Steel) but a lot of that can be explained away using hypothetical science. It is not exactly your typical mainstream sci-fi film because it is definitely thought provoking but then you think about it too much and the film starts to lose merit. The characters for the most part are surface deep and while the film is visually stunning (as far as I'm concerned its ten times the over-hyped Gravity was visually and story wise) the story makes sense and goes from being a little out there to total science fiction/hypothetical physics.) There is a lot to like about Interstellar and to call it epic is an understatement. Nolan inflates his content to the point where there is so much good and so much bad that you're left confused as to whether you loved it or hated it so I think most people want to love it.Who is a hotter star right now than Matthew McConaughey? Not many! I wouldn't call him my favourite actor by any means but I definitely enjoy him. He has an undeniable star quality on screen. Many reviewers call his performance as brilliant mind/astronaut turned farmer a little laid back and perhaps it is. Does that bother me? No. He still gives a very emotionally charged performance and he is believable in his role. He is a commanding presence and he is good at it. Although some reviewers speak highly of her performance I was a little disappointed with Anne Hathaway...only a little. She is certainly one of my favourite actors and as many have pointed out she is very emotional in this film. She cries...a lot. She is believable in her role and she is very stoic and almost brooding at times but she has reason to be and like McConaughey she just has this amazing chemistry on screen. The two of them together are okay. Its not a romantic relationship which is fine but I think I still expected just a little more chemistry between them. Mackenzie Foy is brilliant as the young daughter 'Murph.' Her brief scenes are some of the best and she is really great at it. The supporting cast are all decent including the always amazing John Lithgow, Michael Caine (who was okay in his role but a far step down from his usual gravitas performances), Casey Affleck (a character that was left very underdeveloped in the big picture...and another supporting role by a surprise actor who I had no idea was in the film. Don't look!! Don't find out unless you already have because its kind of a nice surprise and in today's day and age you don't get a lot of surprises. He is also quite good in a very different role for him. And Jessica Chastain...oh my evil little nemesis. I can't stand her. Her entire persona in any film drives me insane. I don't know what it is. Her look, her voice, her acting...literally my most hated star in Hollywood. And yet critics rave about her every time and they do the same in this. Well I can say without too much bias that she was actually okay in this. There I said it. Believe it or not. She is tolerable and gives a decent performance. She doesn't have a huge role but she shows the proper range for the part. I also give hats off to Nolan and his team for bringing Tars and Case to life...the two robotic entities that are major players in the story. Both of them are terrific and add a little bit of appropriate humour, some great action and are sure to be memorable by future generations as much as other famous robots.I'm not sure I've ever seen Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and yet as I was watching this I felt like that was exactly what he was channelling/copying. Maybe that's okay but it just really kept reminding me of that and Nolan deserves to be known for his own style and world. I would have also liked some more depth to the world that they lived in and what was happening to the earth. My biggest beef with the film though is how it ends. Yes it wraps up nicely and everything makes sense and its not ambiguous like Inception was but there was a glaring plot hole to me. After everything they go through out there in space...they learn nothing. There is no information that they bring back and give to earth. So how do they 'save' humanity? Just a thought to ponder. The truth of the matter is I wasn't disappointed. It was thought provoking, visually impressive, beautifully made...perhaps a little (or a lot) more melodramatic than it needed to be but it is what it is. Fans of smart science fiction will love it and the rest of the world will like it or hate it or be somewhere in the middle. It wasn't an Oscar contender for me but I'm glad I saw it. 8/10",8,3,6,24 November 2014
Pacific Rim," Did Asylum films make both versions?
","Here are my expectations for this film. They were not high. I knew the concept was about giant robots fighting giant monsters so science fiction is an understatement. I expected HUGE special effects mixed with a disaster flick and a dash of what made the Transformer's movies good or at least decent. I even went so far as to check this out on 3D IMAX which was granted very impressive because its a huge screen and the monsters and robots that are in this are massive, beyond the scope of imagination. But that little niche is only impressive for the first half hour or so. Then you begin to realize how completely empty and vapid the film is. The characters are downright awful, the story is literally pathetic and if not for the impressive visuals and the experience of seeing it on IMAX, I might have even scored it lower. I was thoroughly and nearly completely disappointed. I am confounded that IMDb reviewers are giving this a 10 and that many many many people are talking about how great it is. A friend of mine said that it was awesome because it didn't take itself seriously and thank god for that because what a ridiculous mess the story is. Is it a B-Movie? Yes definitely and maybe they were trying for that but when you spend 200+ Million on a film you don't want to see camp and cheese. I expect at least a decent story. The Asylum I mention in my title is Asylum films who make awful 'Mockbusters' and while I haven't seen Atlantic Rim yet (renamed Attack From Beneath for DVD release) I can't imagine it being worse than the actual version.There are virtually no stars in Pacific Rim and that is unforgivable in this type of blockbuster. The film was desperately crying out for a major name with big charisma. Chris Pine, Matt Damon, Ryan Reynolds, hell even Bruce Willis could have made this more watchable. Instead they cast Sons of Anarchy star Charlie Hunman in the lead role and act like he's a major star. They did that with several characters where they shot them from certain angles or gave them certain scenes as though they were huge Hollywood stars and that was cheesy. Hunman is bland and boring and ridiculous in the role. Worst of all, he's still playing Jax from Sons of Anarchy. He swagger walks his way through this film like a biker and it looks dumb. Idris Elba might be the biggest name in the film. He also does a decent job especially compared to Hunman. His character is decent and he brings a little bit of chemistry to the screen so bravo to him but it doesn't help. I also find it odd and distracting that Elba's English accent seemed to float in and out intermittently. Wherever Rinko Kikuchi came from, she needs to go back there fast. She is an example of someone that nobody knows and yet they act like she is Michelle Yeo and we should be impressed that she's in the film. Her acting is simply awful and the chemistry between her Hunman is excruciatingly bad. Their one good scene was the training scene together (which makes no sense to the film but was one of the few good scenes.) Ron Perlman was the one great cameo and a great character and he was fun, had some good lines and a great scene. He might be the one redeeming quality in the film if Elba isn't enough. Certainly his cult status made him at least recognizable. Max Martini and Robert Kazinsky are okay in their roles but achingly predictable and cookie cutter characters we've seen hundreds of times before. None of the aforementioned characters though can compare to how truly atrociously awful the characters played by Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are. These two play Scientists and their performance belongs in the worst kind of low budget smut you could find. Gorman is literally painful to watch how awful he is. And if you want to tell me that it was sarcasm or clever irony I will slap you because both characters were two of the worst I have ever seen and shame on these actors for doing so.Speaking of shame...shame on Guillermo del Toro, a talented storyteller for making this crap. I am still in shock at how many reviewers, professional and average movie goers are loving this. The story is so bad that it goes nowhere. They don't even spend any time at all building you up to the story. The film begins and the narration says 'Giant Monsters attacked the world, we built robots, here are the robots, we fight the monsters...and go'...it drops you right into the battle. So the first battle is impressive and a little fun to watch and certainly visually stunning. The second, third, fourth etc etc battle which are the same thing over and over and over again is so incredibly tired and unoriginal. I have often spoke out against the crowds for films that I thought were incredibly entertaining (White House Down most recently) so now I am bravely going against the crowd to either warn you about what you're about to sit through or perhaps open your eyes and make you realize how bad this was. It was probably one of the worst movies yet of the summer. Its another HUGE example in the vein of Jack The Giant Slayer, Battleship and John Carter of ALL flash and absolutely no substance. Poorly done Mr. Del Toro. 5/10",5,2,11,18 July 2013
American Sniper," Controversy aside, everyone must see this movie period!
","I'm going to begin to look forward every year to January. For the past two years at least, the best films I ever see are always in late December and early January. Its not necessarily due to the Oscars or Golden Globes...I don't always agree with their picks but it seems like some of the best work is done in the latter part of the year. I suppose it shows a maturity on my part that the summer Blockbusters aren't always what win me over anymore. I was disappointed that once again I made it through 2014 without handing out a single 10 and now in one weekend in January I am handing out TWO solid 10/10's on two 2014 films. I hesitated on both of them because its a rare thing for me to hand out tens but I have to go with my gut. American Sniper was mind blowing. It is emotional and beautifully shot, it is heart wrenching, nail biting and it is the perfect blend of mainstream action with based on a true story military biopic (similar to what Lone Survivor did.) The cast is fantastic (led by an absolutely awe inspiring performance by Cooper) and Clint Eastwood (who I once idolized and has slipped from my graces lately) proves he still has an eye for making films.Bradley Cooper has been Hollywood elite for some time now. He has really climbed the ranks and he is proving himself to be versatile and charismatic. Cooper as Chris Kyle though is just incredible. He is driven and heroic and compassionate and determined and patriotic and just commands presence on screen, never mind his physical transformation as he looks massive bulked up. Even in pictures of Chris Kyle you can see Cooper worked at capturing who he was and he deserves his Oscar nomination. Sienna Miller is also very good as his devoted wife who shows a lot of incredible emotion and you really feel for her in her situation. Their chemistry together is fantastic and she deserves a lot of recognition as well. Despite two amazing lead performances don't count out the supporting cast because these guys were equally as amazing and had some incredibly emotional scenes. Jake McDorman, Kevin Lacz, Cory Hardrict, and Eric Ladin were amazing as Kyle's fellow Seals. Unlike many other bio-pics (and the reason I think for the film's record-breaking financial success) is the fact that the film blends together bio-pic with mainstream action. There are some genuinely terrifying villains in this film played by Mido Hamada, Sammy Sheik and Navid Negahban. These three guys at various points in the film are terrifying and the idea that they are even loosely based on reality is sickening. The rivalry between Cooper and Sheik as enemy snipers is enough for an entire film on its own.I get the controversy behind this film. I even understand it. I just don't care. I'm not getting involved in it and I'm not letting it effect my opinion of this movie. I am not here to discuss whether Chris Kyle was the hero some say he was. I went to see a film and it was moving and entertaining and incredibly well made and I judge it on those basis. For those of you who insist this is sort of right wing propaganda...I didn't see it. I am a Democrat and I have some issues politically with Clint Eastwood but this film wasn't pro-war...in fact I think it showed a very balance opinion of the pros and cons and how it truly effects a human being. The opening scene of this film when Kyle is forced to make a decision between killing a young boy to save his fellow soldiers is gut wrenching. I don't think the film is entirely realistic and it even feels very mainstream but that also doesn't take anything away from how great this film is. This movie will be a classic and you absolutely must see it now!! 10/10",10,17,47,19 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Sassy, stylish, a chick flick based on chick lit that SHINES!!
","Devil Wears Prada is the kind of film that the female demographic will LOVE!! Not to stereotype but it's full of fashion, sass, triumph, tragedy, tears and laughs. It's a feel good movie with a strong moral center and a movie character that will live on as classic...the devil herself. I have never been a Meryl Streep fan and in fact on numerous occasions have questioned why she is the most nominated Oscar actress but it's a cinch to see that is destined and deserving of her 14th Nomination playing The Devil (more on that later.) The film has a terrific story which I have never read the novel but I think it seems to capture the essence perfectly. While not exactly a laugh out loud comedy it's the type of film that makes you smile because you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has had a tough boss and certainly Andy's is the pinnacle of that and watching Andy deal with her and overcome this situation and job and be the bigger person and learn about her life and desires.Anne Hathaway takes the lead in yet another adult role as she desperately struggles to make her mark as a serious non-Disney Actress. She'll do it and Devil Wears Prada is a huge step in the right direction, and one she doesn't have to whip out her boobs to prove herself. Even still it seems Hathaway is trying SO hard to prove herself and sometimes it shows so her performance suffers. She was so relate-able in Princess Diaries and her character needed to be relate-able to everyone in this film and she succeeds just not 100%. She gives it about a 75%. Still her character is strong, and outgoing and does everything she can to take on Streep. And on top of that Hathaway DOES hold her own against the amazing Streep. The down side to Hathaway's character is her rather questionable moral standards which fluctuate a great deal throughout the film sometimes making her seem less desirable but she does learn her lesson by the end which is good. Emily Blunt is terrific as well in a small role as Andy's co-worker 'Emily.' Emily is the typical girl you don't like. Stylish, skinny, and basically a bitch who must get won over by Hathaway's character which she does to an extent. Blunt is believable as a fashionista, and believable as Streep's assistant. Stanley Tucci is terrific in his role as Nigel, the rather direct and harsh fellow Fashion worker who very reluctantly befriends Hathaway. His role could have been bigger because he is great but nonetheless he does terrific. Adrian Grenier is Hathaway's boyfriend, already established in the film who gets pushed aside by Hathaway's ambition. You definitely feel sorry for the guy and he does well in this grown up role as a struggling 20 something chef who always gets shafted by his live in love. They don't really get a fair reunion in the end and I still felt like he could have done better after all she did. And finally...the performance of the film...The Devil herself Meryl Streep as the infamous Miranda Priestly. Priestly is just evil. She's cunning, cold blooded, completely emotionless, demanding, horrific, and yet the most respected woman in fashion and Editor and Chief of Runway magazine. Streep's performance is drop dead amazing, one of the best of the year. Her Devil is so not outwardly evil but has this slow, quiet, subtle way of worming her way into the viewers loving to hate her. She has terrific dialog and every line she speaks drips with disdain and serious conceit. The fact that Hathaway idolizes her in some ways is actually understandable because she is so powerful. Streep MUST get an Oscar nod for this role.Hathaway and Streep's chemistry is remarkably terrific and yet Streep's character is never impressed, and never shows it despite the eventual mutual admiration. This whole film relies on and flourishes because of Streep's character and Andy's entire adventure working at Runway. Director David Frankel definitely carries over his Sex and The City experience to create a film definitely aimed at the female population and I'm sure it hits the mark. Much of the fashion humor was way over head (and fortunately I had my girlfriend there to explain it to me) and I must be insane but the numerous references to Anne Hathaway's weight MUST be fashion sarcasm to show the fickle and absurd opinions of the fashion industry. She is even referred to as 'not skinny' on several occasions. Ummm yeah...not so much a good impression on young girls since Hathaway is skinny as a rail. The fashion in the film is very chique and definitely not the average person's fashion but the film is truly remarkable and a must see!! 8.5/10 (HUGE 9/10 for Streep's performance.)",8,0,0,24 July 2006
Rocky II," More of an epilogue than a sequel, the fans had to have it!!
","Sylvester Stallone took matters into his own hands to bring his magnificent character back to the big screen in 1979. Stallone not only penned the sequel as he did the original but he took over as director giving him the unique ability to control his characters the way he felt they should but the brilliance is that he didn't change them from their original style or character making it one of the most consistent sequels I have ever seen. Granted the characters have had some evolution since the original but it's gradual and real and the film still has that gritty, real, lovable quality of the original. It only just barely falls short of the magnificence of the original. One of the nice things is that we are given a far more in depth look into the life and personality of adversary Apollo Creed, but as far as the other characters they are really only added upon because they were so well cultivated in the original.Once again Stallone picks up his unstoppable underdog Rocky Balboa and the love of his life Adrian. Stallone manages to recapture everything you loved about Rocky in the original. You do however start to see a little less of those little quirks that made Rocky so spectacular a character in the original and which eventually almost fade completely in the subsequent sequels. Nonetheless Stallone does a great job with the role again. Also returning is Talia Shire as the less shy and awkward Adrian whose romance with Rocky is at full swing including their engagement, wedding and pregnancy. Shire still is perfect as Adrian and is the perfect companion to Stallone's Rocky. As rough around the edges as he is, she suits him perfectly and their chemistry is unmistakable. Burt Young returns as pessimistic and chronically miserable Paulie. His role isn't quite as defined as it was in the first one but he still does a great job supporting everyone around him. Paulie is an unmistakable quality about the Rocky films, and Young IS Paulie. Burgess Meredith returns as tough as nails trainer Mickey, Rocky's mentor and father figure. Meredith adds such an incredible experience to the series and is the perfect mentor. In some ways he's so mean and gritty and yet he has this knowledge about him that Rocky respects in such a deep way. And finally someone who this sequel was very good to is Mr. Carl Weathers who plays Rocky's greatest challenger, the Champion Apollo Creed. Since their unstoppable battle the world now questions who truly won their match and Creed thirsts to prove his worthiness. We get a further look into Creed's home and his style and his training and the people around him including his family. Weathers is electric and loud spoken and flamboyant and is everything Creed was created to show but he has a determination going into this fight that makes him the perfect adversary to Rocky.Rocky II quite simply adds everything to Rocky I that we might have wished to see after the closing credits. It's a sequel that had to be made and was made with great intelligence and clever writing and direction by Stallone giving us all our favorite characters again. Best of all it still managed to capture the heart of the original and perhaps even more so since the outcome of the fight is different. The climatic fight is still incredible despite being the same fight from the first one. Emotions run high as Rocky nearly loses the love of his life, brings his child into the world and triumphantly cries 'Adrian, we did it,' which once again brought tears to my eyes. You can't EVER watch Rocky I and stop there, even if you never see the others you must see Rocky II because it just might be one of the most necessary and well done sequels in film history. It is the reason sequels should exist. It only manages to lose a small bit of it's original charm and still be one of the true greats. 9/10",9,2,3,28 December 2006
Forrest Gump," MY 700TH REVIEW and what a great one!! I think Forrest Gump might be one of the best films of all time
","It had been a little while since I watched Forrest Gump and it wasn't but a few minutes before everything I loved about it came flooding back and by the time the credits rolled and I had dried my tears I realized that I think this is quite possibly the best film ever made. It may be my favourite movie of all time and for good reason because it is stone cold brilliant in every way and deserved everything from awards to box office glory that it received. Previously I have stated that JFK is my favourite film and in a complete league of it's own and now I state that Forrest Gump belongs in that category of elite films. The story is infamous and brilliant and touching and disturbing and covers every aspect of genre you can think of. The cast is absolutely brilliant. The direction is stunning and the special effects are unlike anything you will ever see. Director Robert Zemeckis is a brilliant director and has directed his way through many of my personal all time favourites including the Back To The Future Trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and What Lies Beneath. The thing about his story telling is that it's completely unique, there is something completely and utterly different about his films and Forrest Gump is truly the pinnacle of that talent. He seems to know his cast and surrounds himself with the best performances possible.Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor, there is no doubt about it. But he gives the absolute performance of his career as Forrest Gump, a man who is not quite as smart as the average person and yet pure of heart and indeed in many ways smarter than all of us. Hanks makes this character his own, no one could ever play Gump. His tone and body language and everything just embodies the character and it is one of the best performances in film history. Robin Wright Penn plays Forrest's true love and the romance is far beyond just your average romance. Penn is good although I'm not sure she lives up to the rest of the cast. She does do a great job at being versatile and playing her character through the decades and through the different situations in history from Southern girl to Hippie to mother. The chemistry between her and Hanks is undeniable mostly because of the story that makes their love so important to Gump. Gary Sinise is undeniably amazing in his role as Lt Dan Taylor. I don't know who got the Academy Award that year in the category he was nominated for but he was robbed!! His performance is ground breaking and creates one of the best characters in film history. Him and Hanks are just incredible together. Mykelti Williamson, in a bit of a smaller role, is also brilliant as Bubba, Forrest's best good friend in the army. His character is short lived but pivotal and he does an amazing job. I wish I could cover the rest of this amazing cast which includes Sally Field in an amazing role as Forrest's mama. This cast is truly one of the best ever period.What else can I say about Forrest Gump? Beautiful romance, action, drama, laughing, crying, life and death, I mean there isn't anything this movie doesn't give you. It's just this brilliant epic journey that just makes you appreciate life and tells history from a completely different perspective. I've seen this film many, many times and yet for the last half hour of the movie I sat there and watched it bawling my eyes out. It isn't many movies that ever make me cry and it is even less that a movie I have seen so many times can do that. If you haven't seen Forrest Gump you're missing out on a film experience unlike any other and an absolute classic the minute it was released. I understand they are looking at turning the second novel, a sequel, into a film and because I want to revisit these characters I would love a chance to see it but I don't think it could ever live up to this original classic and if the entire original cast including director Robert Zemeckis won't do it...DON'T DO IT...see this movie now or again. 10+/10",10,2,5,3 July 2008
Gone Baby Gone," Perhaps not life changing but still a really well made and interesting film
","If the summer of 2007 of was the summer of action than the Fall of 2007 is the fall to stop and think. I have seen a host of really great films this fall and a lot of them give you a lot to think about and I don't think anything is wrong with that at all. Gone Baby Gone presents itself like a mystery kidnapping film but that's not what is at the heart of this film. This film is far more about a decision made to protect an innocent person and whether that decision is justifiable. On top of that it's also really a look into a Boston neighborhood and I was really impressed with director and co-writer Ben Affleck's capture of this neighborhood (his own of course before moving to Hollywood) and how real everything seemed. It was dark and gritty and just had this feeling of emotions and real life tied up in it and I think that's pretty impressive for Affleck. The story unfolds like a typical kidnapping story but ends up turning into something completely different than you would have ever expected. It's also a very real look into the life of the rough Boston neighborhood which I didn't really think looked on it in all that great of light but perhaps in just a form of reality.Casey Affleck plays the lead role, fortunate to have his older brother directing. Casey Affleck has had some decent roles over the years but nothing really stellar and this performance as young but street smart PI Patrick Kenzie is pretty good. Oscar worthy? Mmmm I don't really think so but it's a good role. I mean how far of a stretch is it for him to play the street smart, tough talking Bostonian because isn't that what he is? Still he commands the screen and does a good job in the lead. Michelle Monaghan was really good in Mission Impossible III with a small role and yet in a critically acclaimed film such as this she's just kind of there. I mean her role is kind of subtle and she has an important purpose as the balance to Casey Affleck's character but she just doesn't make herself stand out in the role. I hesitate to say this but her role is almost dull compared to some of the others. Enter the amazing Ed Harris who IS hands down deserving of a best Supporting Actor nod in this amazing role as the tough as nails Boston Cop. His speeches and emotions and just his entire performance is gut wrenching and he is amazing in this part. He steals the show quite simply!! Equally amazing Hollywood elite actor Morgan Freeman plays a small but very important role as the chief of police. He doesn't get a whole lot of dialog or a whole lot to play with in the role but seeing him on screen is always great. John Ashton is also really great as Harris' partner who often has to step aside to Harris' performance but still does great playing off of that. Amy Ryan, Amy Madigan and Titus Welliver also turn in decent performances as the family of the missing girl.Gone Baby Gone is a bit of a roller coaster mystery because certainly it's left for the viewer to uncover as Casey Affleck's character does. And in the end you won't be anywhere near where you started and every twist and turn takes you further into the mystery but for the most part everything matches up and is brought together without plot holes or question marks. Finally in the end the mystery is not who took the girl as much as why they took her and is what they did morally right and it leaves a really thought provoking question in your mind or maybe not...maybe you will just outright side with one side or the other. Either way the film is a real treat to watch filmed with real expertise but as I said I don't know if I'd label it one of the best of the year by any means and I'm not sure that Academy Award status is to be given for anyone other than Ed Harris' powerful supporting performance and MAYBE Casey Affleck in the off chance. The film is full of gratuitous bad language and a cold hard look at working class Boston. Still it's worth checking out hands down!! Destined to be a new career turn for Mr. Ben Affleck. 8/10",8,8,15,15 November 2007
Ant-Man," The weakest of the Marvel Franchise but hear me out
","I remember a long time ago when they first released 'leaked' footage of Ant-Man screen tests or something like that. It was a poor quality video of 'Ant-Man' kicking some guys butts. I thought it was a joke. Marvel had finally hit rock bottom. This would finally be the film that broke their incredibly impressive streak. I have always said that certain Superheroes simply do not translate well to live action. However, I suppose if anyone can do it, it would be Marvel/Disney who have single handedly changed the face of Cinema over the last decade with their Superhero Universe they have created. Did they need Ant-Man? No. Should they have done it? Not in my opinion. However, its not a total wash. Ant-Man was indeed okay and I'm impressed that they were able to pull off even 'okay.' I think this should have been made into a film geared towards a younger crowd. Start a 'Marvel Kids' Universe. It would have worked much better because the entire concept of Ant-Man looks ludicrous. Although its also one of the most impressive parts of the film is that it relies so heavily on 'perspective' special effects, meaning how the world looks from Ant-Man's view when he is super-small.One thing Marvel has done to near perfection is casting for its Superhero Universe. The cast for Ant-Man is very good but when the plot and concept is so implausible its hard for even the best actors to bring it to life. Paul Rudd struggles (in my opinion) to find the right vibe for this character. His characteristic humour and sarcasm seems almost forced and I'm not sure he fits the role well. I'm not saying he wouldn't make a great Superhero but I'm not sure this script was right for him. One of my all time favourite actors, the legendary Michael Douglas plays Hank Pym, the creator of the Ant-Man suit. Douglas is very good in the role, adds intensity and emotion to the role and probably gets more depth than any other character. I expected him to have a small supporting role and he is actually a main character which was a pleasant surprise. Evangeline Lilly is also good as Douglas' daughter Hope. The romance between her and Rudd is sort of forced and their chemistry isn't there hardly at all which is unfortunate. Corey Stoll is our villain and he is good but not great. Every good superhero movie can be make or break by the villain and he does okay but he doesn't hit greatness. Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and T.I. round out the supporting cast as Rudd's buddies and comic relief for the film. They are good but unnecessary and sort of get in the way more than help.Peyton Reed was a bit of an odd choice for director of this film. I think he's a good director (he did direct the now classic Teen flick Bring It On - no I'm not joking, I love the original Bring It On) and he has far more experience in comedy than action. Ant-Man just feels like it doesn't know where it wants to go. It bridges the Marvel Universe by mentioning Iron Man, Thor, Stark, Avengers and features Falcon in a cameo role. Ant-Man should have been a Marvel One-Shot or as previously mentioned a kids film because it just barely passes as being entertaining and it feels like it has a lot of issues and a stumbling pace. Its okay at best and Marvel is always better than okay. Ant-Man is unnecessary to the Universe and I can guarantee you, there won't be a part two even if he does join The Avengers. This one drags down the overall quality. 6/10",6,6,15,10 August 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Fun, entertaining and a terrific superhero flick...no more and no less
","Marvel had a solid lock on this summer's superhero genre with the exception of Green Lantern. Regardless there was a barrage of Superhero flicks to choose from and they ranged from just okay (Thor) to exceptional (X-Men First Class.) Captain America sits firmly on the better end of those films and delivers exactly what you want from a fun action filled flick that brings an age old superhero to life. I'm not a Marvel comics fan, in fact I'd be surprised if I ever read one but the movies seem to work most times and this one is a little more set to your typical regiment of a modest and unassuming man who finds himself endowed with super human abilities. The special effects were solid without being overused, the story was tried and true to what most know about Captain America and it was an excellent introduction to bringing together all the characters for 2012's Avengers film.Chris Evans wouldn't have been my first choice for Captain America although I do like him. He's known more as the sarcastic one liner heroes than someone more serious but he pulls it off terrifically and the computer effects of him as the younger weaker Steve Rogers and then Captain America were astounding. Hugo Weaving was the perfect choice for Red Skull but I also thought he was underused given he is Captain America's number one adversary. I just thought Weaving could have done more with the character. Tommy Lee Jones is completely wasted as a third or fourth string character unfortunately and Hayley Atwell was also underused as the lead female in the film. Basically the movie focused on Evans and that's okay and even makes sense but if they wanted to give this real depth they could have done more with the supporting cast.If Captain America has one fault it would be that it doesn't surprise you. What you see is what you get and maybe that lack of risk should be heralded as if it ain't broke don't fix it but they certainly don't take any chances with the character or the film. Its exactly what you would expect. Director Joe Johnston has done some terrific adventure films and even worked with George Lucas and Spielberg at various times in his career so he has plenty of experience backing him. This is probably one of his most exceptional projects and I hope he stays with the project if they serialize it. Captain America is simply put, fun, and there isn't anything wrong with that at all. Its the perfect introduction to the first avenger and worth seeing!! 8.5/10",8,1,2,29 December 2011
American Hustle," Average at best, but what I expected for certain
","I was very, very sceptical about American Hustle. It seems to me that every year there is one of these films that critics love, there is all kinds of buzz about and it nails a whole bunch of Oscar nominations. I knew from the trailers exactly what I would think of this. I expected something very 'Argo' like which was okay but the furthest thing from what I thought was a 'Best Picture' contender. Well I was entirely right in my initial expectations...sort of. At the half way mark of American Hustle I was actually quite impressed. It was a little bit artsy and bizarre and the cast of characters are way out there and in your face but it was entertaining me for sure. It was just weird enough that it still had me watching intently. Then it continued...and continued...and continued and had to keep pushing itself further and further until the pacing was nearly excruciating and any redeemable performances were ruined by pushing the characters too far. What is left by the end is a very different sort of crime thriller about a group of characters that are diverse and strange and ridiculous (in a mostly good way.) This film was made to appeal to critics and the Academy and it accomplished that so who am I to bash it.The cast is definitely an ensemble cast and impresses as much as it does takes it too far. Do I agree with the main cast getting Oscar nominations? No not really. I don't see anything particularly moving or unique about any of the performances. They are certainly over the top, perhaps satirical (I hope so for their sake) and often ridiculous but they work for the context of the movie. Christian Bale absolutely transforms himself into a fast talking con-man with a terrible comb-over and huge pot belly. He is probably the best of the cast and gives the least silly performance though he does have some outrageous moments too. Amy Adams is sort of landing on my more annoying than appreciated list. She shows up so much lately and I just don't find her 'that' good. She was actually decent in this and her and Bale have good chemistry. I don't feel as though she particularly takes off in the role but she definitely does a good job. Bradley Cooper is absolutely over the top, ridiculous and incredibly whiny as the FBI man determined to catch his big break. I don't mean to say he isn't good in the role because I think the character was meant to be ridiculous and whiny. Still he got really irritating by the end of the film and I was simply tired of his character and that's not a good sign for a movie. Jennifer Lawrence, as she always is, was a shining beacon in this film. She has a small role comparably to everyone else but its a terrific, sarcastic, biting role that was simply fun. She really is stunning when she's on screen. Jeremy Renner was also pretty good in a smaller supporting role. I'm not a huge fan of his either but he was sparingly used in this and yet his character was vital to the big picture and he didn't get in the way of the story. Michael Peña and Louis C.K. deserve mention as well in very small almost cameo level roles. Speaking of cameos, watch for a barely recognizable and uncredited Robert DeNiro immediately upping the ante in a small cameo role that was fun.The movie wasn't a bad movie. It was an okay movie. Perhaps if it wasn't getting SO much critical acclaim and Oscar nominations I would go easier on it but because so many love it I have to pick it a part even more. David O. Russell is sort of hit and miss for me. He's a very talented writer and director and I have enjoyed some of his stuff but then every once in awhile I find him just too forcefully artsy for me. Its like he goes out of his way to appeal to critics and I can't respect that. I feel like movies are for the general audiences and for entertainment and if you're specifically trying to appeal to critics then shame on you. American Hustle feels like one of those movies. How exactly does Amy Adams sitting on a toilet and randomly screaming into the air make sense? Or the gratuitous and pointless lust filled scenes with Cooper and Adams? It doesn't play into the story that very successfully sets itself up for a great crime thriller in the first half and then is reduced to a silly, satire by the second part. Amongst a TON of very worthy competitors, American Hustle should be way down the list of potential winners in my book. Its worth seeing but honestly I won't even remember I watched it by tomorrow. It was all around average at best. 6/10",6,3,5,12 February 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," You could not possibly ask for a better wrap up to any series, and one of the action greats of all time!!
","This has been one heck of a summer for Action films, and trilogies, some good, some not so good. Live Free or Die Hard still stands out as the best action film I have seen in years and yet now The Bourne Ultimatum comes along and once again blows me through the back of the theater. If you've followed this series from the first installment then you can understand the absolute desire to closure in the series but still keep that element of mystery and that is precisely what the Bourne film makers did including Paul Greengrass, who has this distinct and often talked about format for his films that really works for a film like Bourne Supremacy and Ultimatum. He took over from Doug Liman (who stayed on board as executive producer for the latter films) and Greengrass flawlessly and perfectly picked up the story without missing a beat and followed through all the continuity, all the mystery and then packed a wallop with this final installment. His sporadic and crazed filming style (the constant shaking of the camera) works really well for Bourne because it's that kind of hectic and crazy action and it's not overdone to the point where you're desperately trying to see what's going on. Greengrass knows how to send the story in the direction he wants and then to unfold brilliant action scenes when necessary.Matt Damon is just down right brilliant as the quiet, intense, depressive Jason Bourne who has had everything taken from him and is now getting closer to ever to figuring out his identity. Bourne's brilliance is as top notch as ever and he's honed his skills beyond what they originally taught him so he's even more himself. Damon embraces that so well and performs this role with no ego, he's not Matt Damon impressing us all as Bourne, he IS Bourne and he is perfect at it pulling off the fighting, the killing, the eluding and still a very sympathetic character. Joan Allen returns from Supremacy as Pamela Landy, the anti-heroine for Bourne who wants to help him find his identity and uncover the truth of project Treadstone. Allen is appropriately intense for this role, and a great female lead to Damon's intense male role. I might even say she would do well in a bigger role but still her performance is great. Julia Stiles also returns as logistics agent Nicky Parsons. While never a big role in any of the three films, she's been a presence and her presence in this new installment opens up a new mystery in the Bourne history. Stiles is a terrific addition to the cast and the only one to return for all three films except Damon. Amazing character actor David Strathairn joins the cast as cold blooded head of the 'new' Treadstone Noah Vosen. Strathairn is an amazing follow up to the character of Alexander Conklin played by Chris Cooper who was an incredible nemesis for Bourne. Straithairn valiantly takes over that role and is amazing. Add in a supporting cast of the amazing Albert Finney (in a sadly very small role), Joey Ansah (in one of the most amazing fight scenes in movie history), and Colin Stinton.What is the best part of The Bourne Ultimatum? Easy. If the Bourne films have been anything...they've been story driven...one of the best, if not THEE best stories from an action film in history. Amnesia, love, killers, assassins, government agencies, a cover up...all of this has been heaped on in two movies and these films have been so story driven and they have done such an incredible job of doing this story that there isn't anything to do in Ultimatum but wrap everything up. The best part of that is it leaves it wide open for some of the most incredible action scenes, and absolute non stop action that will leave you completely breathless. A car chase that rivals any film, a brutal hand to hand fight that leaves your jaw dropped onto the floor, brilliant roof top escapes and gun fights, and constant chaos everywhere. I will only say one minor flaw was I thought one particular chase went on a little long, it wasn't varied enough to really keep you riveted as long as it continued but it climaxed in a spectacular hand to hand fight so it was all worth while. Ultimatum also continues Bourne's amazing and exotic location shooting while still bringing Bourne home back to the door step of the United States and the C.I.A. The Bourne Ultimatum is an incredible end to the trilogy and I PRAY they change their minds and bring Bourne back for another round because this series has truly only gotten better from one film to the next. 10/10",10,4,10,6 August 2007
10 Things I Hate About You," An absolute teen classic. The Breakfast Club of the nineties!
","Many words have been used to describe 10 Things I Hate About You. Not all good. I've seen predictable, fun, stereotypical, touching and so on. All of these might be true but the key to the film is that it will endear itself to you. In the decade since I saw it for the first time I have likely seen it dozens of times and every time I simply fall in love with it all over again. The fact that it is a brilliantly clever retelling of Shakespeare's Taming of The Shrew only helps solidify it as a really fun, and better than other teen type flicks of the nineties or any other decade. The characters make this film what it is. Fun loving, over the top, and a very diverse group of people that everyone will easily find a favourite or more than one favourite character. The cast works so well together, and the story moves at such a perfectly entertaining and hilarious pace that you will just enjoy every minute. The film has the demographic of mid to late teens in mind certainly but it doesn't try and treat the audience like kids. The film has plenty of gross out humour, tastefully used of course, and a crass feel to it but some sort of life lesson about romance and growing up is firmly in place.The late Heath Ledger became a household name as the bad boy Patrick Verona with a heart of gold. Ledger is just absolutely charismatic in his role and is enough to make guys high five and girls swoon. I actually consider this character and Ledger's performance to be probably one of my favourite. Absolutely holding her own and matching Ledger's Verona shot for shot is the amazing Julia Stiles who gives probably her best performance or close to it as the vivacious, tempestuous Kat Stratford. Misunderstood, catty, angsty, brutally sarcastic and downright hilarious Stiles plays a strong willed, if not slightly flawed teenage girl who goes through a lot of growing up as a lot of the characters do. Stiles and Ledger are absolutely brilliant together and one of my all time favourite romantic comedy couples. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quiet and subtle and almost too adorable as Cam. Even though he isn't as bold and strong a character as some of the other he is easily the sweetest in the film and will be plenty of people's favourite. If Stiles is the perfect match with Ledger then the perfect match for Gordon-Levitt would be the equally as sweet Larisa Oleynik. She is first presented as extremely vapid and shallow but quickly gets far more depth and gets to grow up a lot in the film. She learns some valuable lessons and her and Stiles are terrific together as siblings. David Krumholtz is deliciously geeky as Cam's new best friend Michael. He's downright hilarious and has some truly amazing moments and gets to have some great romance in the end as well. Andrew Keegan is hilarious as the conceited teen model Joey and the object of Bianca's (Oleynik) affection...at first. He is a bit of a villain to the story but certainly never much of a challenge to anyone as he gets shown up time and time again. And finally the absolutely amazing and hilarious Larry Miller who plays Stiles and Oleynik's insanely over protective father. He is one of my favourite Dad's and is absolutely perfect. I will forever remember him in this role.This cast just works so amazingly well together and everyone fits these perfect roles and brings them to life. Director Gil Junger has a ton of experience if not almost entirely from Television but in this case this isn't a bad thing whatsoever. He obviously has a great grasp on humour and knows how to tell a story. The cast works so well together and Junger should be given credit for putting them together. The writing team of Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz have gone on to write some incredibly fun scripts including Legally Blonde, The House Bunny, and She's The Man to name three of my favourite. They're stories are simply fun and hugely entertaining but I'm not sure they've done anything that meets the level of this absolute classic. It is one of my all time favourites and is fun from beginning to end. 9/10",9,0,0,14 July 2010
Rush," I eat my humble pie Mr. Howard...my apologies
","You may wonder what the title of my review means? I think Ron Howard is a brilliant director obviously. However, when I first saw trailers for Rush it did nothing for me. I sort of turned up my nose and thought this was pretty low on the Ron Howard totem pole. I will see pretty much anything in theatres and yet I had no desire to go see this one. For one reason or another that I won't bore you with I ended up at Rush on a cheap night at the theatre. I should have put more faith in Mr. Howard. This was an incredible film. The acting was first rate (Oscar worthy even?) the story was terrific, the action riveting and being based on a true story made it all the more fascinating as it covers what sounds like one of the greatest sports rivalries in history that I had never even heard of. I am not a racing fan, I have never even sat down to see more than ten seconds of a car race and yet this story could impress anyone. This is about two larger than life characters that have this rivalry that leads to this incredible level of respect between them. At times it had a little bit of a Rocky feel to it as many sports films do but it was all around and excellent and very entertaining experience.A big part of that is Chris Hemsworth who literally gives the performance of his young career. Hemsworth was brilliant. Hemsworth was Oscar worthy. Best of all to me he proved he is more than Thor or a pretty face because he was amazing. His cocky and determined James Hunt was one of the best character portrayals I have ever seen. Not to be outdone Daniel Brühl is also extremely good as Nicki Lauda. It sounds like he really nails this portrayal of the former racing champion. The film is somewhat from his perspective and he narrates some of the film. The character of Lauda is fascinating as he has an almost anti-social, mildly autistic vibe to him and yet like Hemsworth's James Hunt you gain such a respect for him as a racer and what he goes through. The chemistry between Brühl and Hemsworth is perfect for the film and both men give A+ performances. The supporting cast are all decent though no one particularly stands out. Thank goodness Olivia Wilde is only given a small role as Hemsworth's wife. Wilde is not a great actress in my opinion and even in her small screen time she comes across as silly though she does alright and their chemistry is decent enough. Alexandra Maria Lara also does decently as Lauda's wife and she manages to do quite a bit in a very small role showing what she goes through as his spouse.Ron Howard is a storyteller. I should have remembered that. He has done some amazing based on real life stories that have been instant classics. Somehow he always knows how to capture the human spirit and the human condition and characters that are as vibrant as fiction. From the drama and emotion to the edge of your seat thrilling races he nails this. He also cleverly manoeuvres his way around showing countless and seemingly never-ending races by highlighting certain aspects of many different races and covering them fairly. Now my loss of a point to him is the adult content in the film. I am not a prude, and I can watch just about anything and it does not offend me. This film did not offend me but was the adult content necessary? No not even close. The gratuitous nudity and obscenities (mostly in the first half of the film) was completely unnecessary to earn an R-Rating. My issue is that it is distracting to a very good story and it also means a certain demographic shouldn't see this and it is a great story in sports history that teens, kids or even adults that don't enjoy that sort of content might miss out on because of the extremity of the R rating. That really disappointed me. Nonetheless this was a brilliant movie that seems to be a little under-rated at the moment which is unfortunate because both lead actors deserve accolades for their performance. Check this one out, you won't be disappointed!! A surprise gem for me that will likely land on my best 2013 list. 9/10 (three 9/10 films for me in the last week...impressive!!)",9,4,6,23 October 2013
Predator," The quintessential Schwarzenegger film and an action franchise classic
","The beauty of Predator (which other reviewers pointed out) is that it truly is a B-Movie type monster flick but made inherently better by a solid director and the incredible star power of Arnold Schwarzenegger. It truly was brilliantly made given the budget for the time and they managed to jump start an iconic series that has lasted almost three decades! Honestly, the first part of the film, the first hour is really a 6/10 B movie shlockfest that is entertaining but really nothing spectacular. Then, the Predator makes himself known, and the last twenty minutes or so when its no holds barred Predator vs Arnie it just amps this film up to action film legendary status. The setting for the film is perfect, the thick lush jungle giving way to the ideal place for all the insane kills and violent war scenes. They even manage to open the film with a battle against soldiers that has essentially nothing to do with Predator and yet makes the film even more interesting and fun and sheer entertainment. I think for its time the special effects are pretty decent, and hold up even now. And of course you can't ignore the iconic one liners 'Stick around!' and my personal favourite 'Get to the Chopper!' No matter how you shake it, this is an action film classic.Much can be said about Arnold Schwarzenegger's acting. The thing that can't be denied is his incredible screen presence. He is larger than life and has this chemistry when he is on screen. Predator also solidifies Arnold's status as a complete bad-ass. His roars of war and his campy line delivery and he stills looks like the meanest SOB and the only man who can take on this alien monster. While the supporting cast are really mostly just fodder for the Predator the writers actually gave them some solid personality and characters. 80's sidekick legend Carl Weathers is his usual serious and glaring self as Dillon. The scenes between him and Schwarzenegger are perfect and the side story of their long time friendship and the betrayal is well placed. Bill Duke, Jesse Ventura, Sonny Landham and Richard Chaves are all good rounding out the rest of the team. The one character I would have liked to have seen more from was Sonny Landham whose character Billy seemed to have a lot of depth and a back story that would have been interesting to explore a little bit. Elpidia Carrillo plays the only female in the film and she does alright. I think she was basically put into the movie to have a female presence but its mostly unnecessary. There is no romantic story between her and any of the characters (which is good) and her performance is okay but un-needed ultimately.Whatever happened to John McTiernan? How did this guy start two of the greatest action franchises in history plus a handful of other top notch action flicks and then nothing else for almost a decade? This was McTiernan's second film and his talent is obvious. He knows how to tell the story and utilize the characters perfectly. The man is an action genius. Predator might not have been the first film to combine distinct recipe for action with a horror flare but its probably one of the best. The special effects are decent as I mentioned but the Predator, that's where the money shot is. He is impressive and disturbing and overwhelmingly awesome. In one of my favourite all time scenes when the Predator throws down his weapons and removes his mask to challenge Scwarzenegger's Dutch...his appearance is simply outstanding. It actually made my skin crawl and as only Arnold can put it 'You are one ugly...' If you love 80's action, if you love Schwarzegger and sci-fi and horror...this is truly one of the greats!! 8.5/10",8,2,3,2 February 2013
Nightcrawler," Twisted, dark, psychotic and fascinating
","I wasn't sure what to expect from Nightcrawler. Critics had raved about it but it was essentially shut out of the Academy Awards so I was going in without expecting much. What a terrific surprise. This is a gritty, dark and twisted thriller with twists and turns you don't expect and a story that literally keeps you on the edge of your seat just by storytelling and not by using special effects or even scenes of action. It is the definition of a thriller and certainly has undertones of social commentary about what is acceptable and what is 'news.' The film is undeniably creepy. There is something off about our main character and its not the sort of story where you 'root' for a hero but rather you're a witness to something strange that you can't turn away from. Maybe that's the brilliance of Nightcrawler. The entire film focuses on the old expression 'if it bleeds, it leads' and how we are entranced by suffering and gore and we are sitting there watching this guy immerse himself in that world and we are once again transfixed by it. The more I think about this movie, the more impressed I am by it. Its another film from 2014 that I am catching up on that won't easily be forgotten. Its extremely intelligent and a must see thinker.Jake Gyllenhaal is one of Hollywood's best talents. He has proved himself time and time again. I think the roles that suit him best are ones with a lot of depth to the character. He seems to have this knack of making you intricately understand even a supporting character. You can't help but be mesmerized by his fast talking, manipulative, bizarre, eccentric and almost morally corrupt Lou Bloom. Its a fantastic job by him and he commands the lead. Rene Russo is the producer of a late news program who Gyllenhaal forms a strange sort of work relationship with. It has this sort of sick feel to it and they both have a desire to use anyone or any situation to get further ahead. Their brief mention of something more profession only adds to the eery quality of their relationship and the film. Riz Ahmed is Gyllenhaal's intern who is put into harm's way to further Lou Bloom's agenda. Ahmed is okay in the role but he could have done more with it and he sort of gets buried by the overpowering performance of Gyllenhaal. Bill Paxton has an unfortunately small role as a rival freelance reporter. He has a great role and the few scenes he has with Gyllenhaal are fantastic. Their dynamic could have been an entire film on its own and their last scene together is stomach turning.Writer and director Dan Gilroy is brand new to the scene for directing and he is off to an amazing start. I usually discourage writers directing their own work and usually a new director shows a lot of inexperience but Gilroy is a terrific exception. He has created this dark twisted world that if you're looking for a thriller that is far different than anything else out there, you will find this perfect. It is a water cooler film or perfect for a film club or class. I think this story has layers that can be examined and talked about but on the surface its just a very intelligent film. There is even a car chase of sorts in the movie that is just amazing because it comes out of nowhere and yet fits the film very well. Car chases are a dime a dozen in movies and most of them look the same but this one stands out. Nightcrawler is a unique and worthy film so definitely give it a shot! 8.5/10",8,5,9,23 January 2015
Léon: The Professional," A rather obscure, dark, gritty pseudo-comedy that is altogether disturbing and watchable
","It has been literally years since I wanted to see The Professional and finally after waiting and waiting I picked it up for really cheap and gave it a watch. I didn't really know what to expect and I still don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. In a way I have to give it to the film makers because they took an age old dramatic twist and added complete obscurity to it. It's the Punky Brewster, A Simple Twist of Fate (Steve Martin), Raising Helen (Kate Hudson) I could go on and on and on. A little person (usually a precocious little girl) inadvertently enters a single man's life and changes him and that is precisely what The Professional is only add in brutal gritty violence, sexualize the little girl to an almost disturbing nature, and just make it this really loud and violent story about two very different people who find each other. None of this makes the film inherently bad, just very adult, and gives it a very ominous and disturbing nature. I think this is exactly what has made The Professional the cult classic that it is because it takes a very big stretch in a genre and makes it somehow almost comical and yet dark and gritty and really twisted. Most people label The Professional as an action film and it certainly has that but I think I would say dark drama with thriller aspects.I have always liked Jean Reno. He really is a versatile character actor although he has never really broken into main stream. He certainly doesn't long for work as he has almost 80 film credits to his name and has done action, comedy, drama, foreign and domestic pictures and even was featured in a video game. As The Professional Reno is perfect. He has this dead pan face that just fits the role perfectly. He looks like a loner and he is still believable as a ruthless killer with a history of his own. He commands a presence on screen and yet it isn't quite leading man quality. Ultimately the young and very precocious Natalie Portman truly steals the show as trash talking, street wise Mathilda. She really does make the film and she should have been heralded with acclaim for this performance although a girl of her age shouldn't be in a performance like this. It's probably up for debate but I think they do sexualize Mathilda and Reno's character looks at her as a daughter figure but also a wife figure in some ways as she does him vice versa. Gary Oldman is over the top and deliciously twisted and deranged as corrupt cop and bad guy Stansfield. He is a terrific villain and a worthy adversary to Reno's Leon. Even though Oldman goes completely bonkers with this performance, somehow it works for the film. He is stunning. Veteran actor Danny Aiello has a rather small and not very effective part as the mobster Kingpin who gives Leon his jobs and carries his money for him.Now the only other experience I've had with director and writer Luc Besson is The Transporter and The Fifth Element and I think Besson is a brilliant director. I think he definitely thinks outside of the box when it comes to tried and true genres like action. I mean The Fifth Element was sci-fi action and yet it has this strange obscurity to it that makes it a cult classic and The Transporter definitely has a certain style to it and The Professional is no exception. Besson goes for his own certain flare and he wrote and directed this film with exactly that in mind. I don't know who I would recommend The Professional to...action fans might find it a little slower than most and drama fans might find it a little way out there but if you're looking for something a little different with some decent to really good performances than The Professional is worth seeing or if you like Luc Besson because this one has his stamp all over it. 7.5/10",7,1,4,15 April 2008
Oblivion," Oblivion left me oblivious
","First of all let me say that I think ten or twenty years from now Oblivion will be right up there with Blade Runner, or Moon or any other sci-fi movie that becomes a cult classic that a select group of people rave and worship. There were certainly things about Oblivion that was stone cold brilliant but I'm going to be perfectly honest and just say that I didn't understand a lick of it. I am still desperately trying to figure out the entire concept. The scenery and setting of the film was brilliant. There was this amazing feel of desolation and apocalyptic wasteland that is not to be ignored. The film makers together with their star create this bizarre but so important feeling of melancholy and nostalgia for the way earth used to be. The problem with the film for me was that it dragged significantly. The pacing felt entirely off for much of the film. On top of that this incredibly complex story never really explains itself. Maybe I missed something but it was far more difficult than it needed to be. I guess I just wanted more...more explanation, more details, more background. But that wasn't their intent so I can't fault them for something that maybe I just missed.Say what you will but Tom Cruise is still a superstar. I love the guy. He's had way more amazing movies than bad ones. This film is really perfect for him. He shows an intensity and appropriate emotional level for his character. And of course being Tom Cruise he switches that into action flawlessly. He is still very versatile and makes this film better than I really thought it was. Andrea Riseborough is his partner on the desolate earth station. They have good chemistry and she is very good in a role that I think is meant to be a little wooden. She is almost robotic in her actions but her lack of emotion or at least very stoic emotion is on purpose I believe. In that way she does a good job. Olga Kurylenko is also as good as Riseborough as the mysterious survivor that has a tie to Cruise's Jack. They have good chemistry too although not quite good enough I don't think considering the angle of their relationship. She gets just enough character development to squeak by but I think she could have done more if she had been given more. Morgan Freeman shows up in an unfortunately small role as the leader of a group of rebels. He is good as he always is but the role is excruciatingly small. I wanted to see more dynamic between him and Cruise.It is true that I had some high expectations for this film. I thought it looked awesome, I really like Tom Cruise and sci-fi films and I almost missed this in theatres and finally caught it last minute. Considering director Joseph Kosinski got his big break only a few years with the mega-anticipated sci-fi epic Tron Legacy, you can't say the guy doesn't know sci-fi. He is clearly a talented director. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the direction, the special effects and the world he creates. The only issue is how little I understood the story and the pacing of the film. It isn't that it didn't entertain me but it was just perhaps a little ambitious or perhaps less mainstream than I was expecting. I think I will watch it again when it releases on DVD and re-address the review and until then I encourage you to see it for yourself. I think sci-fi fanatics will love it and perhaps I missed something. For the time being I consider it average for the reasons I discussed. 6/10",6,2,4,9 June 2013
Bird Box," Fan-$#%^&-tastic
","Bird Box is yet another representation of why Netflix literally rules entertainment. This is the type of quality film that may not have survived the box office although it's one of the best movies I've seen this year but Netflix lets film-makers and cast and crew create and create they did. Bird Box is one of the best post apocalyptic films I have ever seen. It isn't entirely a unique premise, blending I Am Legend with The Quiet Ones and The Road and a handful of others. But this film is powerfully acted, uniquely terrifying, brilliantly directed and the cinematography is exquisite. Many people commented that they didn't like the ending but you know I loved it. This film is so intense and dramatic and you almost expect it to have this bleak ending that I was relieved and felt empowered by the ending.
Sandra Bullock is astounding in this role as she goes through a character arc as diverse as the film itself. This character has so much depth and back story and you begin to understand her even the elements you don't like about Mallory. This is a tour de force for Bullock and she looks amazing and she drives this film flawlessly. John Malkovich is equally as good and the only hard part about watching him is that his role is too small. He also gets a great back story and an interesting character and has amazing on screen charisma. Trevante Rhodes, Sarah Paulson, Jacki Weaver, Danielle Macdonald, Lil Rel Howery and Tom Hollander all deserve mention for their performances in supporting roles. Vivien Lyra Blair and Julian Edwards are superb as boy and girl, the young children Bullock will do anything to protect. The cast is so good together and the way the film wraps itself together just gives you an incredible insight to these people and the bizarre experience they're having.
Director Susanne Bier absolutely makes this film her own. Apparently she is known for making films that focus on familial relations and this film proves that. It's almost a secondary theme to have this apocalyptic unstoppable creature as we see these people trying to desperately fight for what they believe in. First Netflix has The Apostle and now Bird Box, two of the best films I've seen in a long time in this genre as well. 10/10",10,4,18,27 December 2018
Watchmen," An absolute colossal disaster!! Perhaps one of the worst movies of the year if not ever
","Every year there is usually one movie that I think is a sure fire enjoyment for me and then it turns out to be utter garbage. This year it happens to be one of the most expensive, big budget movies of the year. The Watchmen trailer looked incredible!! Dark, violent, gritty, based on the DC Comic, action packed....the film was an absolute utter bore-fest. There was some very minor positives to the film but it certainly wasn't enough to make me every want to lay eyes on this film again. I should also mention I have never once read the 'award winning' graphic novel and now I don't think I ever want to. I find it almost mind blowing that there are some fan boys/girls that 'love' this movie because I simply saw nothing to it period. The best I can say about it that the film is dark, violent and gritty but unfortunately after 20 minutes to a half hour...you just won't care. The action is mixed with far too much sheer boredom and that doesn't bode well given the 2 1/2 hour run time for the film. Watchmen is a giant paint canvas that the film makers and Zack Snyder treat like their own piece of work.I really like rising character actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan and perhaps an entire film about his anti-hero The Comedian might have made a more impressive solo film but his murder story simply led the crew which were less than impressive. However Morgan is still a great actor and does well making us love him and hate him all at once. I believe the true hero and star of this completely lack luster film is Jackie Earle Haley who plays the twisted psychologically disturbed hero Rorschach and his alter ego. Haley single handedly gives this film ONE redeemable quality and his performance and his hero deserve so much better than what this film offers. I hope Haley goes on to bigger and much better things. Now I will put together nearly the entire cast under one roof because they all equally stink up this 'film.' Matthew Goode is downright terrible as a gay evil villain who turns the entire concept of villains into a joke. Patrick Wilson is annoying, geeky, and a total joke. Carla Gugino has virtually no character depth and is mostly simply there to take her clothes off. Billy Crudup voices and partially plays the mysterious, emotionally void Dr. Manhattan. His character might have an interesting plot but the character itself is lame and very naked throughout the entire film.Watchmen might be some sort of graphical achievement and might be followed by legions of fans but this film to the layman is lame. Director Zack Snyder was spoiled with the 300 acclaim. Now I think he felt like he had free reign to create this so called piece of art at a fantastic budget. Unfortunately Snyder has turned down any hope at appealing to the mass audience. I don't know how it could possibly appeal to fans of the graphic novel let alone anyone, like me, who had never heard of or seen the graphic novel. This one just plainly stinks and will not be a hit of the year in any way. 3/10",3,6,14,15 May 2009
The Bourne Identity," A spy film like no other, the beginning of an incredible series
","The Bourne Identity in many ways revolutionized the expectations of people that love spy films. How is it different from the run-of-the-mill action films? I don't think you'll find another action film, let alone action series that is as story driven as The Bourne films and in particular The Bourne Identity. A mystery begins to unfold right from the first scene and you're caught up in this world of Jason Bourne and you're discovering everything as he is discovering everything making you feel like you're right there with him and feeling empathy for his character while being shocked and riveted by his realization of what he is. The Bourne Identity is exotic and brilliantly filmed in such incredible European locations as France, Spain, Czech Republic, and Italy and if you think that doesn't make a difference...watch The Bourne Identity because the locations are something that really makes The Bourne Identity what it is. Add all this espionage and action together and they still find time to establish a meaningful and very powerful romance between Bourne and a woman he randomly meets and it's a relationship so significant that it remains a driving force in Bourne's life right up through the trilogy.Matt Damon has had some good roles, and has proved himself a very versatile actor but his role as Jason Bourne may stick with him forever because he does an incredible job capturing this cold blooded assassin with actual empathy and this strong, silent, deadly, and yet compassionate person. His performance is amazing and Bourne is movie history. Franka Potente plays the girl in the wrong place at the wrong time Marie Kreutz, who becomes romantically involved with Bourne. I don't find Potente beautiful in the typical Hollywood sense and in fact she's almost kind of plain compared to some starlets and yet that's what makes her and Damon have incredible chemistry and a very real romance together. She also blends in with her surroundings and has this very unique and exotic European look (she is German by heritage.) Chris Cooper is brilliant as the angry, and forceful C.I.A. villain Alexander Conklin who is desperate to get rid of Bourne before it uncovers his involvement with an undercover assassin project. Equally as brilliant is Brian Cox as Conklin's co-conspirator. Julia Stiles makes a small cameo entrance into the series as Logistics expert Nicky and although she doesn't have a big role, she becomes significant to the cast and is often tied to the series. Also watch for Clive Owen in a small role as assassin sent to kill Bourne in the English Country side.The Bourne Identity tells it's story and doesn't apologize for not being the typical blow everything up, non stop action type of film but it certainly has it's share of action and some incredibly choreographed fight scenes. Damon's Bourne is a far more brilliant hero and doesn't resort to simply using a gun but rather is always a step or two or five ahead of his foes and is so well trained it's just thrilling to watch him get out of every situation. When it comes down to it he can kick some serious ass and the fight scenes are incredible and his abilities are unparalleled making this just an incredible action, spy thriller with an intense story that starts a great mystery that spans three films. With each installment of The Bourne films they get better and better but this is where it all starts and it's a stone cold classic and a must see for anyone who thinks they know the spy genre because this revolutionized it. 8.5/10",8,2,2,6 August 2007
Justice League," The DCEU is getting slowly better
","I have been a DC 'kid' for 35 years give or take. I have been a Superman fanatic for nearly as long. I have my comic collection, my Superman collectibles, and the love of live action DC films. Man of Steel for me was a colossal disappointment in many ways. Zack Snyder really let me down and butchered so much of the Superman I knew and loved and changed so much about him. The casting was average at best (Amy Adams as Lois Lane is the worst Lois Lane yet) and the plot holes you could fly a jet through. But it worked to boost DC's film universe finally. Batman v Superman was better but still had some definite mis-steps. Wonder Woman so far is easily the best film of 2017 and one of the best I've ever seen period. I still blame Snyder for a lot of DCEU issues so far. I was pretty hesitant about Justice League and yet felt like I've been waiting for this movie my whole life. One of my biggest passions in life was the Death of Superman story line and I feel like Batman v Superman underplayed it but there was some redemption in Justice League. I think Joss Whedon's rewrites and re-shoots might have made a big difference here. Snyder still doesn't seem to understand that for superhero films we still want and need depth and back stories and details that make sense. I am starting to see a certain style in the DCEU that in part has to do with the CGI which seems clumsy but then I have to wonder if it makes up part of the look.Interestingly Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot take point on the Justice League as Superman is dead at the beginning of the film. Both are perfectly cast. I wasn't sure about Gadot at all until the Wonder Woman film and now no one else could ever do it but her. I feel like Wonder Woman was so incredible that she didn't get used enough in this but she was still great and her and Affleck have good chemistry that should be explored more in future films. Affleck is a great Bruce Wayne and Batman. I think it'll be a real shame if he doesn't continue in the role. He seems passionate about it and his angle works and he has that weary, cynical vibe that is very important. I'm still not sold on Ezra Miller as the Flash. He does the role well enough but he doesn't sit right with me in the role. There's something awkward about him and he doesn't have that same chemistry on the team. There are two characters I was certain they could never pull off and that was Cyborg and Aquaman (two of my least favourite DC heroes.) Ray Fisher and Jason Momoa play them and if one great things comes out of the Justice League it will be that both characters and actors are great! Most surprising is Momoa as Aquaman who actually is fantastic. He's bad ass and I could almost imagine a stand alone film and Aquaman is a horrible hero in my opinion. The chemistry with him and Batman is great too. Jeremy Irons, Amy Adams, Diane Lane and JK Simmons show up in their small roles. Adams is horrible as ever as Lois Lane (I would have stayed dead if I were Superman), Irons is fine but very underused and seems bored, SImmons looks the part but same as Irons seems bored and Diane Lane is good in her role. There seems to be a ton of complaints about the villain in the film Steppenwolf. It is weird that I've never even heard of him but he's a good enough villain played by Ciarán Hinds. I think they underplay the importance of his connection to Darkseid who would be the more obvious villain. He is a worthy foe until Superman shows up.Artistically, I think there is some great scenes in the film. Not unlike Wonder Woman the battle scenes are very good but also very CGI'd but it works just fine. Some of the cinematography is also very good. The addition of some comic recreated scenes (the black Umbrella shot from Death of Superman) and the hidden spatter of Danny Elfman's 1989 Batman theme was a nice touch. Given the short run time of less than 2 hours, I am amazed they were able to make the film as coherent and fun as it is. The humour is well placed. The downside to this film and most of the DCEU in general is the story feels rushed at times and there are pertinent details left out for the sake of timing and we're expected to accept it (it's very much a Christopher Nolan move to leave plot holes and expect us to ignore them because he's Chris Nolan.) The addition of a race between Superman and Flash was great and I thought Cavill really stepped up his role as the symbol of Superman. All in all, I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to watching it again. It's a step in the right direction and I think a good thing that Snyder had to step down to allow some fine tuning. Snyder should step aside completely and let others with more vision take over. 8.5/10",8,0,2,4 December 2017
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The masterpiece finally won me over and although I won't claim 'greatest film' it is truly brilliant
","It was years ago that I saw the Lord of The Rings trilogy one at a time in the theater because even then they were created a massive historical stir and I don't remember exactly why but I just wasn't taken by them. Perhaps it was the hype? So I finally got around to watching Fellowship of The Ring in order to give it a proper review and I turn away all previous opinions and I bow to the authority of the famous Lord Of The Rings: Fellowship of The Ring. Number 20 in the all time highest grossing world wide films and voted #17 of the best films of all time on IMDb. Would I bestow the same honor on it? I certainly respect it's place in film history and I completely understand people's love for it and I loved it as well and now appreciate it even more although I won't utter perfection quiet yet. Fellowship of The Ring still clocks in at an unapologetic 3 hours and often feels like it's running long but at the same time I understand why director Peter Jackson had to have this freedom. He was translating one of the most beloved and enormous fantasy novels in the history of literature and the most amazing thing is he pulled it off. He managed to keep the story perfectly in tact, create all these brilliant characters and create this world with special effects and cinematography unlike anything the film world has ever seen. Fortunately the enormous budget helped but certainly his creation paid off.I wish I could go into detail with the cast because they are as brilliant a casting job as any ensemble cast. The highlighted actors who do an incredible job creating their characters are Sean Astin, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee, the amazing Ian McKellen (who is one of the truly stand out roles as the amazing and beloved Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, Hugo Weaving, Elijah Wood (in his career making performance as the emotionally distraught and powerful young hero Frodo Baggins--also one of the films great performances), Ian Mune, Billy Boyd and I could truly go on about each and every one of them. Although I think one of the small problems with The Fellowship of the Ring is also completely unavoidable at the same time. This film redefines the word epic. This IS EPIC!! The battles and the story and the journey and the intense and amazing scenery and something has to be lax when it comes to all this and I think the character depth is one of them. I mean Jackson does a terrific job of making sure we become entwined with these characters but they don't get as much attention as you might think and in doing that some of the actors might not get to really perform to their full extent. The exception to this rule is the two performances I pointed out in my breakdown by Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood who are at the forefront of the film. The rest of the cast support them and they give them enough life for movie goers to love their favorite character. Out of 13 Academy Award Nominations only one was for acting and it was for Sir Ian McKellen.Fellowship Of The Ring is absolutely a stepping stone to probably one of the most remarkable and renowned film trilogies in movie history topping even Star Wars in most people's minds. There is no doubt something truly brilliant about this creation and it's a fantasy world that will undoubtedly ever be matched. I suppose I am being harsh and speaking blasphemy by not giving Fellowship Of The Ring a perfect score but it just wasn't quite there for me but I can't wait to re-watch the rest of the trilogy because I have no doubt my love for the series will grow exponentially. Fellowship of The Ring was meant to be an introduction and there is (as many have made fun of) A LOT of walking and adventuring. Still this film absolutely must be seen by anyone who loves fantasy or science fiction or literary turned to film because this is an example of someone (Peter Jackson) who truly put his heart and soul into it and made something incredible. A true classic and an epic of the largest proportions. 9/10",9,1,3,25 August 2007
Man of Steel," Summer blockbuster that I waited a very long time for...
","The debate on Man of Steel goes back and forth. Everyone has something to say and its incredibly controversial. Man Of Steel was high on my expectations list, I was busting to see it. However, I was determined to not get bent out of shape by ANY liberties that they took with the character. Superman needed a complete reboot to be successful and they would have to do some bold things to make that happen. Well, they did exactly that. Man of Steel is an incredible science fiction film that happens to feature Superman. It gives us some incredible special effects but also falls short in crafting the Superman world. When Singer did Superman Returns everyone's big beef was that it didn't have enough action. So here is the biggest action film you will ever see featuring a super hero. The last hour of this film is hands down the biggest, city levelling battle I have ever seen. They don't just reboot Superman...they create an entirely new Superman for a new generation. Sadly, there are some shortcomings in doing that. Superman stands for something. He is iconic and the personification of a hero and in some ways they drop all that. You could have removed Superman and had the exact same film. Still, its a brilliant re-creation that just misses some of the vital steps in order to appease the mass audience.Henry Cavill was brilliant. He was an amazing Man of Steel. Due to the way the story plays out he never truly gets the chance to play the duality of Clark and Superman. Still as the tortured alien angle, being the last of his race he is excellent and riveting to watch. Amy Adams is Lois Lane. I love the character of Lois Lane though it has not been done right in films yet in my opinion. I was very concerned about Amy Adams playing the role. As it turns out, she did pretty well. However, the character of Lois Lane is completely underused. She is there because Lois Lane has to be there. The romance between them is rushed and the chemistry is lacking and that is unforgivable in a Superman film. The banter between Lois and Clark which is always paramount to a great Superman story is lost because of the direction they take. So Amy Adams might be okay but she is misused and almost ignored in this film. She is filler space and I would have rather they left her out entirely and saved it for a future sequel. Michael Shannon is near brilliant as General Zod as I expected he would be. He makes an incredible villain and the perfect adversary to the Man of Steel. The supporting cast range from very good to just okay. Kevin Costner is seemingly perfect for the wise Jonathan Kent who has always guided the character of Clark in protecting his identity. Unfortunately, he is underused and his character's involvement feels very rushed. We really don't get that relationship between Clark and his father because it feels so rushed. The eventual sacrifice Jonathan Kent makes for his son is a powerful scene that some hate and some love. I'm not sure what to make of it at this point. Russell Crowe is very good as Jor-El...probably the best portrayal on screen easily. His role is very sci-fi and I'm not sure I like how they kept working him into the modern story. It felt a little Deus-Ex Machina for my liking. Laurence Fishburne made a great Perry White but much like Lois Lane, he is only there to appease fans because Perry White has to be there and has very little development. Harry Lennix, Christopher Meloni and Richard Schiff are decent in small cameo roles as various army personnel. Diane Lane is okay as Martha Kent but some of her lines that she delivers felt almost cheesy and at one point she is tossed violently and walks away unscathed. Antje Traue deserves honourable mention as Zod's right hand woman who gives Superman a great battle mid-movie. On one hand the film has some of the best action scenes I have ever seen. An absolute perfect 10 when it comes to the sheer epic of battle scenes. The flying that they created was absolute perfection. Every time Superman flies it felt like I was learning to fly and experiencing it for the first time. There was just something awe inspiring about flying. The plot holes were unforgivable in some ways but they were also Nolan-esque. Dark Knight Rises had similar plot holes that were just ignored to tell the bigger story. The other thing that truly bothered me was as epic and incredible as the fight scenes were...it levelled Metropolis. It would have killed thousands of people...and yet by the end of the film it is tied up in a neat little bow and not even mentioned. I understand that a certain amount of this just has to be expected but it bothered me nonetheless. The lack of character development was disappointing. I wanted Clark and Lois banter, I wanted the epic building of their timeless romance, I wanted Daily Planet scenes (they never even show the iconic Daily Planet globe), I wanted Jimmy Olsen, I just wanted a little more of what makes Superman...Superman. I suppose they have a lot to build off of going forward and I understand everything Snyder and his team did to reboot this. I'm simply airing my disappointments. This is still an incredible summer blockbuster and I WILL see it again. Don't compare this to absolutely anything before it. It is what it is and if you allow yourself to appreciate the good and accept what might bother you...you will be entertained. 8.5/10",8,8,15,23 June 2013
Grease," Finally seen the patriarch of modern musicals...and it's the...one that I want
","This is one of my girlfriend's favorite films and yet I have never seen it!! It took me nearly thirty years to sit down and watch it. Grease's pop culture pull is easy to see...I mean I recognized nearly every number, and different scenes that have been re-created or poked fun at, or just been on people's lips. I don't know if that added to the film but I was blown away because Grease is just a blast. I suppose it only stood to reason since Grease single handedly jump started the career of John Travolta and re-started the musical genre for the big screen and is literally a timeless classic. I'm not sure I've ever heard anything bad about it. I found a few very minor things that stopped it from being truly a perfect film and making it not my favorite musical but still incredible and a must see!! The first thing that really turned me sour on the film is the age of the cast. Yes I know, it's a commonly poked fun of thing and some, if not most, of the cast were from the original Broadway show but there is still something disturbing and insulting to the viewers to watch 30 year olds trying to portray High School students. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are the only two that come close to pulling it off and they aren't young either in the film.John Travolta plays the timeless Danny Zuko. Cool, suave, rough and tough and having fallen in love over the summer he now has to remain cool in front of his friends when his love shows up at school. Travolta IS Danny Zuko and I'm not sure anyone could ever play Zuko with the same style or pizazz. His dance moves are timeless and flawless and his campy and cool Zuko is dead on. The lovely Olivia Newton-John is Sandy Olsson, Travolta's love interest. She is absolutely perfect as the polar opposite Sandy to Travolta's Greaser Danny. They have amazing chemistry despite their differences and Newton-John has a style and flair for the musical numbers too. She is perfect. Stockard Channing is the fire-y and outspoken Rizzo. Now she is one of the worst when it comes to age...she looks like she's forty (she almost was---34 to be exact) but trying to play eighteen-ish? Still she does the part very well and definitely makes Rizzo the character she is supposed to be...she is just far too old. Jeff Conaway is the trouble making best friend to Travolta's Zuka...Kenickie. Conaway was only 28, a virtual baby compared to some of the cast but he still looks too old. Still he does a decent job of capturing the Greaser style and look. Didi Conn has to be given mention as the adorable and sassy Frenchy. She does a terrific job and it's easy to see why she is so many fans' favorite. The rest of the cast is equally good and they have a great ensemble.The cast is legendary and have become icons because of this film and yet I think this is far more about the musical numbers, the dances and the historical and memorable scenes...'Don't make laugh Sandy ha ha ha.' It was even more fun watching for the first time because it was like seeing history in action. I knew of almost every scene, every dance number, every character just from having people talk about it and scenes from other films references. 'Greased Lightning', 'The One That I Want' and 'Summer Lovin'' were just awesome and I could watch them again and again. The film definitely must have been considered a little racy even for the seventies considering it deals with 'Teen' Pregnancy, drinking, sex, and some rather vulgar language and sexual references. Director Randal Kleiser never did another musical...before or after Grease and yet was able to create a masterpiece of musical cinema. He has had some great films since and was an icon of the eighties and even though he may have slipped a little since then, he will forever be remembered for creating Grease. If you're a hesitant musical fan, or never seen Grease you MUST!! It will MAKE you a fan and you'll love it and if you are a musical fan who has never seen it...I can't tell you how much you need to see it. Grease is a knock out!! 9/10",9,2,4,25 December 2007
28 Weeks Later," Hollywood nabs an indie horror that made the big bucks...and that's not a bad thing
","The original film came out of nowhere and became even more than a cult classic. Danny Boyle's original 28 Days Later redefined an ailing 'Zombie Horror' genre and put this intense, story driven spin to it and it worked and it was fantastic. It only made sense that they would hard to find a way to serialize the successful film and I think they did a great job but in all fairness they threw tons of money at it and made it a completely different type of film while still keeping the core idea in tact. I think it's terrifically ironic that the film is focused on the US Military coming in and taking over Great Britain following the Outbreak much like Hollywood took over Danny Boyle's small little indie film. Still the story is decently well written although toned down significantly and I would not call this sequel story driven as much as it is horror and action and somehow it doesn't surprise that the majority of people seem to think 28 Days Later was a superior and better film than the original and I would tend to agree with them. I suppose the thing is 28 Weeks Later is just fast paced, adrenaline charged and more entertaining as far as Horror/Action films are concerned. There are no returning characters from the first installment which always disappoints me but the returning characters is the infected beings that come around for another attack.Strangely the lead male in the film is kind of split between two...one in the first half, and one in the second half of the film. Robert Carlyle takes on the role of devoted father who is living with the guilt of having left his wife (his kids' mother) behind in an abandoned farm house where they were hiding during the infection. Carlyle is very good and has some strong moments of emotion in the film. Then he gets to take a completely different turn as one of the infected, crazed zombies and gets the prestige of really being the first member of the infected that we, as movie goers, follow. He doesn't just get mowed down right away like the rest of them. Imogen Poots and newcomer Mackintosh Muggleton are the focus of the film as Carlyle's children who return to Great Britain after being overseas during the outbreak. They both do a great job together and are essentially the focus of the entire film. They carry the weight of the movie on their shoulders and do it without hesitation. Amanda Walker does a decent job as the American Doctor who discovers that the kids may have an immunity to the infection and does everything she can to protect them. She is good as kind of a supporting main character but they don't utilize her much. Jeremy Renner is also kind of the back seat star as the reluctant hero who finds himself determined to help these kids and the doctor escape before the military obliterates the infected area. He just isn't used as much as one would expect for a hero.Very much unlike the original film this is far less of a character study and more about the actual infection and following one of the infected more closely and the fast re-spread over the area. What the means is you get more special effects, buckets more blood and gore but only a portion of the story. Technically in this case it does make it more of a mainstream horror and maybe more interesting for horror fans which is why some consider this superior. I think director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo is a little green to be taking on a project like this and doesn't have quite the vision that perhaps Danny Boyle had behind the camera but nonetheless from a Horror Genre perspective it was very well done and very entertaining and you do still care about the characters. I don't oppose serializing this franchise, I just wish they brought back someone from the original film and maybe they will in the future. I think it could be a very lucrative franchise if Danny Boyle takes back the helm. 8/10",8,2,3,22 January 2008
The Thing," Isolated Paranoia at it's height!
","John Carpenter still is the master of terror. His scares go far beyond the typical jump out of your seat thrills although he often delivers those as well. As he proves in The Thing, and also with The Fog his level of scare goes into the psychological and makes your skin crawl with every detail of it. The Thing is put together beginning to end to scare and not just with the alien life form itself but the setting and the characters and everything else around it.The Thing takes place in the Antarctic which plays such an enormous role in how this film makes you feel. You couldn't possibly be any more isolated than these men are. Despite all there modern equipment and living arrangements they are thousands of miles from any other human being or contact and all they have is each other. Each one of them have their own skills and reason for being there and overall they have it pretty easy considering their location. That is until another local expedition brings something over to them that will uproot everything. A Norwegian expedition uncovers something in the ice that eventually makes it's way to the American expedition and now is determined to get inside each and every man in order to eliminate them so no one can stop him from continuing on world domination. It's a shape shifter but so much more than that. It literally takes over the person or thing that it inhabits. Given time it can act, speak, think exactly like it's host. What does this mean?? It means that any one of the men in the American expedition could be infected with The Thing. That drives up the level of paranoia wondering who is infected, which one of them is it and when will it be revealed. And when it is Carpenter reveals it in a horrible, gruesome, gut wrenching way. This really is one of the ultimate sci-fi horror films of the eighties. Anyone watching this will have their nerves on end as much as everyone locked away in that habitat.The cast is good!! Kurt Russell is great in the lead role as the tough as nails, quasi-leader R.J. MacReady. He's very rough around the edges, mean almost but bent on survival not only for himself but to protect the world from this thing getting out. Wilford Brimley plays the doctor of the crew who immediately becomes overtly paranoid when he realizes any one of them could be the alien. Unfortunately his behavior marks him to everyone else as the possible alien and they lock him away. T.K. Carter plays Nauls, somewhat of MacReady's adversary especially when it comes to looking at who may or may not be next. Everyone's performance is very intense and adds to the action. Each one of them plays the victim and the paranoia very well. More than anything this film is about isolation and these men being hunted in such a small area with no other option but to try and stop it. It's an intense thrill ride and any fan of sci-fi or horror must see this absolute John Carpenter classic film!! 8/10",8,1,2,8 January 2006
Armageddon," Another Bruce Willis classic action...always one of my favorites since the day I saw it for the first time
","It was July 1st, 1998...Canada's Day for those of us who are Canadian. I skipped the fireworks and decided to rush out to see the new Bruce Willis movie entitled Armageddon and that day brought me one of my favorite movies to date even 10 years later. I caught it again recently expectantly while on vacation on TV and was impressed all over again. An ensemble cast that makes the film funny, edge of your seat action, huge special effects, amazing director and production and even a terrific story line amidst a rather predictable plot that had been done before and has been done since in one way or another. Many write how much they hate Armageddon but at well over 300 million dollars grossed and even some Oscar Nominations for effects and sound and such...somebody loved it and I was one of them. I have even read some who called Armageddon campy and I can't agree with that at all. Top notch special effects, and a huge budget ensured that even the wildest plot seemed feasible and real. You were strapped to your seat the minute they left the planet right onto that asteroid and then all the way back to Earth. It was the thrill ride of the decade.Bruce Willis led the cast of slightly unknowns at the time as world class oil driller Harry S. Stamper who lives his life on his oil rig along with his now grown daughter Grace. Willis plays this character to a 'T'. Some would say it's his 'usual' character but in this case Harry Stamper is the usual Willis. He's macho, and oozing testosterone and the brighter of the group and he's a concerned father and a determined driller. He's a self made man and won't let anyone tell him how to do things. Willis is a powerhouse on screen. He was at his finest. Liv Tyler is Willis' daughter Grace and doesn't get a lot of screen time compared to some of the other cast members but she still does well showing the emotion and playing the romantic lead opposite Ben Affleck. Affleck plays young, head strong and very stubborn A.J. Frost who is in love with Stamper's daughter much to his dismay. Affleck and Willis butt heads on numerous issues but in the end are like father and son. They have great chemistry together and even the romance between Affleck and Tyler which is like a sub-sub-story works well and really adds to the plot. The supporting cast is just about brilliant and really jump started some careers...Billy Bob Thorton plays NASA administrator heading up this mission from the ground Dan Truman. Although the role is a little small he still manages to make the best of it and really give an emotional performance. Will Patton is terrific as estranged father and husband ready to be a hero 'Chick' Chapple, Steve Buscemi is good and important but a little over zealous as the woman hungry and a little deranged 'Rockhound.' Owen Wilson is pretty good as the cowboy Oscar Choi who gets some humorous one liners but I'm still not sure what his purpose in the mission was. Michael Clarke Duncan is terrific as the heavy lifter and operator 'Bear' Kurleenbear, Peter Stormare practically steals the show as stranded and reluctant cosmonaut Lev Andropov. And William Fichtner (who seems to pop up in various character roles) plays the lead NASA Astronaut on board Colonel William Sharp who butts heads with Willis on numerous occasions and holds his own against him.Michael Bay is no stranger to action films and definitely has his own wild style when it comes to directing and producing. He directed amazing action flicks like Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and The Island (which I liked!!) and is bringing to life the Transformers this summer. His gritty realism in the face of what otherwise would be the unbelievable makes him a master of this genre. He can make you believe anything and then take you on a wild ride as though you were sitting right there with them. Armageddon is the type of movie where when the ball gets rolling you could stand with your jaw dropped and not move until the credits role because the action is literally non stop and it's almost stressful to watch everything unfold one scene after the next. If somehow you haven't seen Armageddon you're missing out on one of the most fantastic disaster, action epics of the last decade. Please I insist you see this one because you'll enjoy every minute of it and it doesn't disappoint fans anywhere!! 9/10",9,1,5,6 May 2007
21," Hollywood fodder makes for a quasi entertaining experience
","21 certainly won't go into my books as the most intelligent or deep movie I've ever seen, in fact as far as Hollywood films go 21 is about as shallow as they come. They stack the cast with some big names, flashy romance, the latest fad...in this case cards...Blackjack to be exact, and people will come out in droves to see it. Now there was a Canadian made film about this same story entitled 'The Last Casino' (see my review) and if you ever get a chance to see it definitely check it out because it's one of the better Canadian movies I've seen and it also actually is much smarter and more artistic than 21 but tells the nearly identical story. Still 21 has some key elements going for it including a new hot lead actor that is very talented, a big budget, fun with cards, a half decent story and a little romance thrown in to boot. It just won't have you walking away feeling any smarter or better about life and that's okay as long as it entertains.Latest It Boy Jim Sturgess following his success in Across The Universe plays math genius Ben Campbell. Sturgess has this definite quality about him that I predict will make him an absolute star and big movies like this definitely help and he already has a recognizable face. He is very energetic and really shines on screen and he is just someone you relate to and can watch him in this adventure plus he gets to show some emotion and probably the only character with depth in the film. Kevin Spacey is the powerhouse of the film or at least he's supposed to be. I mean in all fairness he does well as the leader of their gambling group and a University professor but he doesn't do as much with the part as I would have thought. He doesn't really grip you as much as he could have considering the man can act and is a legend in his own right. Kate Bosworth is lovely but in all honestly I found her downright boring in this film. She does little to nothing other than look cute and be a romantic interest for Sturgess' character which I thought the entire romance felt forced anyways although they had decent chemistry. Fellow team members Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira are practically non existent as the entire film focuses almost entirely on the three of the main big actors which is unfortunate for them. Someone who does stand out from the rest though is larger than life Laurence Fishburne as an aging security agent for Casinos. He is really great in the role and makes an awesome anti-hero to the story.The cast is decent although no one really is mind blowing but that could be because of the rather lack luster script. You know a twist is coming and you're trying to figure it out as you go but even if you don't figure it out the twist doesn't really shock you or anything. Basically what I am saying is that millions will see 21 and probably enjoy it and I don't disagree with them. The film is fun but it's just not something that will stick with you for very long. It's Hollywood fodder made to make money and it will likely do that but don't expect it to be a time lasting classic or anything. But check it out and see for yourself. 7/10",7,3,5,15 April 2008
The Revenant," I get it and yet in a way I don't
","I absolutely understand the critical acclaim heralded onto The Revenant. If you begin to look deep inside the inner working of The Revenant you can't help but be impressed. They shot 100% using natural light, the cinematography is stunning, the camera work beautiful, the performances gritty and real...the film from a film making standpoint is a masterpiece. However from a pure cinematic entertainment standpoint it is a very, very, very long story about a guy stumbling through the wilderness for two hours and exacting revenge for another half hour. The Revenant is a piece of art, it was made to be so. I don't know how anyone could defend it for it's brilliant script or multi-faceted characters because neither one is true. Don't get me wrong, Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic in the role but he's fantastic at showing a man surviving, not for giving this historically powerful character. It is like seeing a beautiful painting that is just stunning but staring at it for 2 1/2 hours. I guess what I'm getting at is there isn't a lot of substance to it and I cannot agree that it is anywhere near the best movie of the year because it is successful in one area of film making.Does that mean star Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't deserve an Oscar? No not at all. DiCaprio is mesmerizing in this role. He shows an intensity and a fear and this grit for survival that is really quite powerful. He desires vengeance enough to survive the very worst conditions possible. The bear attack is definitely brutal and really something to remember in the beginning. Tom Hardy is what Tom Hardy is nowadays. He does a funny voice and acts odd and that's his role. His character is essentially the villain and the focus of DiCaprio's vengeance but very underdeveloped character and not a lot of scenes considering. There are a few other half decent supporting roles that are almost cameos more than anything such as Will Poulter and Domnhall Gleeson.One thing I am certain of is that director Alejandro González Iñárritu deserves his Oscar nod. The man has incredible style and if you watched The Revenant with no sound on, I think you would likely be mesmerized by the world he creates. As I mentioned before the setting and camera work is brilliant. I could go back and watch this again just for the little details in the background. The Revenant is a beautiful piece of art but from an entertainment standpoint it misses the mark in several ways. It has some intense climatic moments (the bear attack and the end scene) but what is in the middle leaves you scratching your head more than enjoying the concept. It's a two and a half hour film that was at least an hour longer than it needed to be. It certainly wouldn't be my choice for best picture but for those wild and crazy critics, I do understand. 7/10",7,2,3,22 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Dawdles a little but still a solid and well made drama centering on the characters
","I was thrilled to hear Clint Eastwood was coming back to the big screen again. The man can do very little wrong in my eyes. Yes, like many, I was more than a little disillusioned with one of my idols due to his antics at the Republican National Convention but he is still an icon of Hollywood and a legend on the big screen. Trouble With The Curve is a sports drama that revolves all around the characters. The sport takes a back seat to the multiple emotional levels and relationships between our key players. Its well written and the characters are easy to watch. The film definitely is slow in the middle at times and spends a lot of time getting to the point in some cases but it all comes together in the end with a really terrific feel good ending that ties up all the loose ends. The romance in the film is well done and my only complaint about the ending was there was really no resolution to the romantic conflict in the film. It was just sort of too neat and tidy. Many will certainly find the film slow and some may even say it is 'boring' but I prefer to think of it as methodical. It doesn't rush and keeps its pace consistent and the actors are good enough that it will entertain fans of drama.Its nice to see Clint Eastwood is kidding himself with his roles. His role as an ageing and very crusty baseball scout suits him perfectly. He's lost at getting old and losing the only thing he's ever been passionate about and good at. Its sort of a subtle role for him, he doesn't particularly stand out and yet it is a role his fans can respect. The cranky one liners and the growl we all have come to love, this isn't one of his legendary performances but its a solid one nonetheless. Amy Adams is terrific as his intelligent and self reliant daughter. Adams and Eastwood have solid chemistry together and their banter often keeps the film extremely watchable. Adams is a delight to watch and she is certainly one of the best young female actors out there right now. Justin Timberlake is the former ball player turned young hot scout. His character is fun and light and the least intense of all the characters. He is really strictly there for the romance angle with Adams but they are actually really great together! He also delivers his usual charm and energy to the cast which is always welcome. Supporting performances by John Goodman, Robert Patrick and Matthew Lillard are noteworthy and make the film fun.Robert Lorenz had a big task in front of him being the first director to direct Eastwood in something like twenty years or close to it. However, he's also worked with Eastwood many, many times as second director or various roles. This is however his directorial debut and I think he did a great job. Baseball was always the backdrop but it never took anything away from the characters and their developing relationships. However you look at it, if you like dramas then you'll enjoy the film. If you expect a fast paced film then it won't be for you. The performances are good, the story is well done and its entertaining. That's all you can ask for. 8/10",8,2,6,1 October 2012
Bridge of Spies," A good story and good points but cumbersome to watch
","Bridge of Spies had two things going for it that I thought for sure would make it a hit in my books. You have Tom Hanks and you have Steven Spielberg. How can you go wrong? Probably one of the greatest actors known to us and one of the greatest directors. Bridge of Spies is a fascinating story, well acted, definitely saved from oblivion by the intense talent of the two aforementioned men. However, the pacing of the film is definitively off. It feels slow and it is slow. It is almost cumbersome to try and pay attention. There just feels like there is something missing that makes it more captivating and I think professional critics will agree with me and Bridge of Spies won't make a splash at all. Now all that said, there is no doubt you can see Spielberg's masterful eye and vision in many shots. The film is, at times, a cinematographic masterpiece. Visually amazing scenes of Berlin during the wall being put up and the horrifyingly powerful scene of Hanks watching people desperately trying to get over the wall. The bleak coldness of Berlin at the time (although apparently the wrong time of year for the real story - it worked well for dramatization purposes.) Tom Hanks...the man, the legend...a living icon of Hollywood. He produces and writes and acts and gets awards and he has had an incredible career. He is just charismatic on screen and he becomes every character he portrays and this performance is no exception. His portrayal is passionate and the character well established. Hanks does what he does best. Mark Rylance is getting a lot of buzz for his performance as Russian spy Rudolf Abel and certainly he does a good job in a sort of understated and subtle way. His role isn't very big but it is effective and he and Hanks are great together. It's a very fascinating relationship. The supporting cast are all good but the film definitely focuses heavily on Hanks' character so they get small roles. Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Dakin Matthews, Sebastian Koch and Burghart Klaußner are a few of the better supporting performances in the film.Saying anything about Steven Spielberg's direction is literally pointless. The man is a master and a visionary and as I mentioned you can definitely his expert mastery in the film. The only issue perhaps is that someone who is editing or producing his films might be reluctant to be honest about potential issues. Bridge of Spies goes on too long and stumbles in several respects and even misses some key things that could have made the story more interesting. Still, it has it's appeal but considering Hanks and Spielberg's involvement at the head it is forgettable in its genre and that's simply unfortunate. I sort of had high expectations for good reason it only delivered on a very slight level. Worth watching once but don't expect a Saving Private Ryan or a Schindler's List but poor man's version of either of those. 7/10",7,2,4,9 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Sadly the poorest in the series. Proof they dragged this into two parts to make cash
","I love the Harry Potter films. I have never read the books and probably never will. The films have been breathtaking, brilliant, beautiful, with one of the greatest ensemble casts I have ever seen. They didn't just play their roles but single handedly embodied them. So I was excited and sad to see this second last instalment of the last great fantasy epic. How disheartening to discover that this was nothing more than a forced first part to the two part finale to squeeze more money out of the franchise. 95% of all the characters that made this series incredible are gone. The action, special effects, and brilliant fantasy is practically nil. I read several reviews on IMDb and some loved it and many hated it and the ones who hated it said the same things I thought about it. The starring cast spend the entire film 'warping' out of trouble and into forest. 'Harry Potter goes camping' as one reviewer called it. The amazing supporting cast from previous instalments get virtually no time on screen and the entire 2 1/2 hour film could have been summarized into a half hour before the final film. I can barely summarize how disappointed I was in how they created this filler film.The three original stars return and are fortunately as good as ever. The thing that holds this sub-par entry together is bringing back our favourite characters. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are in full form. The best part of the film is the continuing and growing relationship between Grint and Watson's Ron and Hermione. The rest of the cast are as good as they have ever been. The cast is not, and never has been the issue as I still stand by previous statements by me that this is the finest cast in a film series ever. They truly breath life into this series. Unfortunately the supporting cast shows up for barely minutes. The amazing Robbie Coltrane has less than five minutes as Hagrid, in what could have an A+ addition to the cast, the amazing Bill Nighy spends five minutes on screen as the Minister, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and even the amazing big bad Ralph Fiennes is so sadly underused. The Harry Potter franchise has always been as much about Hogwart's School and the teachers as any other part of it and for Deathly Hallows every aspect of that is gone and instead you are left with teleportation to the same forest again and again.I'm wondering if its a coincidence that the series has been on a bit of decline since director David Yates took the helm. It could also be pointed out that by the time you hit the fifth instalment of the series its hard to keep things fresh but I feel like its more than that when it comes to Harry Potter. Two major plot points happen in this film with the death of two characters and it happens so quickly and with such little fanfare that it feels unemotional. Honestly, I think you could literally skip right over this instalment and miss out on nothing. Its really hard for me to write a review like this because I do love this series and I want to re-iterate this cast is amazing as always which is why I'm scoring this a 6 as opposed to a 2 or 3 which is what the story is worth which is downright side when the entire series thus far has been made up of films worth 8-10/10 easy. This one was a stumble and let's hope they can finish the series worthy of what it is!! 6/10",5,5,8,20 February 2011
The Hills Have Eyes," The most horrifying, rip roaring suspense/thriller in years!!
","I am a HUGE Horror fan, have been for the last 10 years. So you must take that into consideration when reading what will be a glowing review. I had a feeling this remake of a classic Horror flick (which I have not seen) was gonna be good but imagine when I discovered how truly incredible this film is!! It's brutally gritty setting, it's excessive 'R' Rated gore scenes, the apocalyptic 'no one left on Earth' type atmosphere, the chilling and disturbing Nuclear mutated human beings, the controversial 'rape scene', this may be the modern day version of what Texas Chainsaw or The Exorcist was to the film goers three decades ago. Ted Levine is not the star but he's the head of the family, Big Bob Carter. Hauling his family across thousands of miles on his and his wife's 25th Wedding Anniversary. Ted doesn't last long sadly because he has a larger than life character who I thought would put up a bigger fight but I think it sets the tone for how brutal and vicious the killers are. Bob Carter is a former detective who is like Dirty Harry and doesn't take anybody's crap. Levine is good as the tough strong Bob. Dan Byrd gives an incredible performance as eldest son to Bob, Bobby Carter. Byrd goes through the usual range of emotions of any person trapped in a horror film but does it without being campy or off beat. He's strong but terrified, angry but saddened and determined to protect his family. This could really do something for Byrd's career. Oscar Nominated Kathleen Quinlan plays the mother, Ethel Carter in a fairly small but significant role. Much like Ted Levine she only shows a glimmer of what would be a vital character before she is stomped out but that too is meant to be. You're supposed to become as quickly attached to these characters so you really feel their deaths when it happens. Vinessa Shaw (who I thought bares a striking resemblance to Hilary Swank) plays eldest sister Lynne. Her motherly instinct, love for her family, and her sacrifice to try and save her family is definitive. Her performance fits right in with this terrific cast. The lovely Emilie de Ravin plays youngest sister Brenda and I immediately recognized her from one of my favorite TV series LOST. She is the scream queen of the film and probably one of the lesser performers in many ways. She's mostly the eye candy/time filler/ and screamer but for those purposes she does well. She spends probably 80% of the film literally screaming at the top of her lungs and trying to bury her heavy Austrailian accent which only works some of the time. And then we have the hero who starts out as the furthest thing from the hero, Aaron Stanford, who plays Doug, husband to the eldest Carter daughter and father to their infant daughter. Doug is made out to be shallow, rather annoying, unfeeling, always fighting with his father-in-law and maybe even a bit of a philanderer as he catches a glance at this young sister-in-law but in the thick of the film Doug is forced to become the Saviour of the entire family and he becomes this incredible hero who goes the distance and protects his daughter and his extended family. Stanford is unfamiliar to me but he does an incredible job in this role and easily carries the film. He has a definite seventies, hippie look to him which plays a part in the setting of the film which feels retro. He is the perfect guy for this role. Also honorable mention to Tom Bower who plays the disturbed but otherwise normal gas attendant who leads the victims to the killers. He definitely fits the profile of the weird, desolate gas station attendant and although the role is a little predictable he does it well.One of the reasons The Hills Have Eyes is so great is it's unpredictability. How often can you say that about a hacker horror film. Never!! Rarely!! The Hills Have Eyes breaks the mold of who would normally die and how...who would survive...the story that is actually so well done and unfolds very subtly throughout the course of the film. Although some of the situations and characters are fairly run of the mill the plot and setting is very unique and I was so pleasantly surprised at the outcome of who survives...it's so unpredictable!! It's nice to know that not everyone will just get hacked to pieces. Fairly new director Alexandre Aja has hit a true home run with this film. He truly may have found a knack with this horror film. Wes Craven still produces this remake of his original film and I'm sure having the master of horror himself nearby helps a great deal. Still Aja's style was brilliant. He manages to make a wide open, completely empty desert seem like the most claustrophobic place on earth. Everything is shot so up close that everything looms at you and it's just terrifying. The entire film beginning to end takes place in that desert and yet it never gets boring or repetitive. The shock and horror comes from the brutal, gruesome, gory kills and the sheer sight of these horrible abominations that were once normal humans. I think one of the most horrifying scenes in film history is when Doug is attempting to save his daughter and the two grotesquely mutated little girls turn to him and say 'Hey Mr., will you play with us.' BRUTAL!! Better than REDRUM or anything from The Shining. The opening sequence set to soothing classical music that flashes scenes or deformed children will set the mood and your scares for the rest of the film. This film is exactly why we should embrace with open arms...remakes of great classic films!! 10/10",10,0,6,23 March 2006
Little Miss Sunshine," Outstanding!! An absolutely brilliant satirical dark comedy
","I had heard a little about Little Miss Sunshine and it intrigued me enough to want to see it so I finally caught it on DVD and I was blown away by it's creative edge, it's unique blend of dark humor and painful human emotion. The film is quite simply brilliant!! Anyone who truly loves a very real and powerful story about families that will make you laugh as much as it will make you cry must see this film. What makes the film even more impressive is the outstanding ensemble cast that captures every moment of comedy in such a twisted manner that you almost feel guilt for finding the absolute hilarity in their mixed up and disturbed road trip. On top of that co-directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris are long time partners who have pioneered direction in music videos and documentaries but never truly a feature film and yet they smash one out of the park with this incredible story.In essence everyone in this film is a 'supporting actor' because no one character is more important than the other or more featured. They all have this goal and this way of supporting each other's brilliant performances and ironically the one actor to be nominated for a Golden Globe, I thought, was one of the weaker characters and roles. Greg Kinnear is Richard in another brilliant turn as a character actor for Kinnear. Richard is pig headed, stubborn, well meaning but very demeaning at the same time. He doesn't realize the importance of his family and yet he strives and struggles to do the best by them. This is hands down his best role since 'As Good As It Gets' and he still shows he can pull off a powerful performance. Impressive as well is the young Paul Dano who plays emotionally tortured and self inflicted teenager Dwayne who has taken a vow of silence until he completes his life goal of joining the air force and flying. Dano captures the tortured teen perfectly and considering he has fewer lines than any other character he has to rely on his body language and talent to carry the role and he does that wonderfully. He also puts forth some of the really emotional parts in the film and I think he should be recognized for his brilliant part. Steve Carell....STEVE CARELL...well as many truly great comedians do (ie: Robin Williams, Will Smith, Jim Carey etc.) Carell finds the role that might show the world he is far more than a slapstick comedian and he really can't hold a serious role. His role is the best in this film hands down. It's more of a subtle performance as Frank, the suicidal, brilliant and gay brother-in-law/brother who is forced to go on the trip because he is on suicide watch. He immediately bonds with the tortured soul of Dwayne, plays provocateur to the overly emotional Richard and ultimately teaches each member of the family something. This is hands down an amazing feat for Carell who should get an Academy Award nomination for this part!! He never breaks the drama to show off a funny side except to be ironic and satirical the way the movie needs to be. Multi-Oscar and Emmy nominated actor Alan Arkin plays the rough and rugged Grandpa who is soft at the core and loves his family dearly but has many regrets about his life. His crazy antics, foul mouth and love for women makes him absolutely hilarious and an outstanding addition to the cast. Arkin is spectacular. And there is young Abigail Breslin who already has an impressive resume of performances including her debut which was in M. Night Shyamalan's Signs where she did an outstanding job. She further proves her young acting ability by playing the baby of the family, Olive whose desire more than anything else in the world is to be in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Pageant. She is the soul of the family in many ways and she is the reason of the trip and ultimately she is the one that brings them all together in the hilarious, unbelievable climax. She does a terrific job!! Finally Toni Collette plays the disenchanted mother Sheryl and I don't mean to downplay her performance but I don't think the character is as strong as some of the others and therefore her performance suffers but she got the Golden Globe nod so what do I know?? As the head of the family desperately trying to hold everyone together and bring some sense of normality to their lives she seems almost like she's falling apart but we don't really get to look too much into that.So very few films could pull off being so touching and dark and yet make you howl with laughter so loudly. It is such an incredible road trip film that does without special effects, unrealistic, silly premise or anything else but relies on an incredible cast, a real story, and something and someones that anyone could relate to. It's truly the ultimate story of a wacky family that just loves each other and sticks together. If nothing else the climax of the film when Olive performs at the pageant just might become an instant classic moment in film history and will have you laughing to tears. Everyone and anyone could enjoy this movie and is sure to be an instant classic!! 10/10",10,28,41,17 December 2006
Knowing," An intelligent first rate surprise! End of the world movie raises the bar
","I had some certain expectations of Knowing. But they weren't incredibly high. Although star Nicholas Cage has had his fair share of great movies, I was never particularly a fan of his. The action scenes looked solid and the plot seemed like it was decent as well. So I suppose I went with mediocre expectations. So it's never a bad thing when my expectations are exceeded. Knowing turns in a very intelligent sci-fi end of the world story with some truly spectacular scenes and some of the best special effects I've seen this year. On top of that the performances are better than expected and the plot of the film turns out to be smarter than you might expect from this type of movie. The film does go into a unexpected twist that I'm still not sure is a welcome twist but they do make it fit and it does prevent the film from falling into a pattern of predictably that many other 'end of the world' spectacles fall into especially with their endings. The entire mystery that unfolds is even more interesting than I expected and it just makes the entire film far more worthwhile than I thought it would be. It went from being mediocre fun movie to actually being a worthwhile memorable film.My biggest issue with Nicholas Cage is that his ego always seems to win out in his performances. He's one of those 'look at me I'm Nicholas Cage pretending to be...' type of actors. So I expected nothing more or less from him in this film and low and behold...the guy puts down his ego for this movie. He actually gives a meaningful, emotional performance as father and scientist John Koestler. This might not be the best Nicholas Cage movie but I think honestly this is one of his best performances. Young newcomer Chandler Canterbury does a great job as Cage's son. He gets some really great scenes and nails the emotion and the character to a T. Rose Byrne is good as concerned mother Diana and pseudo-potential love interest for Cage although he is still reeling from the death of his wife. Byrne doesn't quite reach the potential in her character that Cage does but she does well and has okay chemistry with Cage. In the same vote is young actor Lara Robinson who plays Byrne's daughter. She does well but pales in comparison to the performance of Canterbury.The real interesting part of this film is the mystery involving the numbers delivered to Cage's son and then to Cage himself. As Cage unravels the mystery of these numbers and where these disasters will occur it really drives the story and keeps you riveted to the entire film. On top of that the three major disasters in the film are mind blowingly portraying and brilliant special effects. The plane crash in particular is brilliant and literally had my jaw dropping. I would watch that scene again and again. I might also mention that director Alex Proyas has really done some brilliant mainstream films including I, Robot, and and Dark City, two brilliant sci-fi action flicks. With his style and flare this movie really impresses. Maybe it overly impressed me because of my mediocre expectations but either way you should definitely check this out because despite what critics had to say this movie will undoubtedly entertain, and surprise. Check it out!! 8.5/10",8,5,11,19 May 2009
Hugo," Beautiful and stunning fairy tale
","Hugo is a unique, visually stunning, and beautifully performed fairy tale that weaves together the true story of a cinematic genius with folklore and fantasy. Branded as a children's film but truthfully I believe the young at heart will be the ones who will just have their breath taken away by this adventure. It has a more methodical pace than your usual children's adventure fantasy, and the emotional depth to the film will leave you with tears in your eyes. Scorcese proves his worth as an artistic director with Hugo. Asa Butterfield absolutely shines as the young boy looking for purpose in his world. He is part Oliver Twist, and part Huckleberry Finn and just rivets you to his story. Chloe Moretz is excellent though I think nearly underused in her part. Her and Butterfield are adorable together. And Sir Ben Kingsley gives his best performance in YEARS as Georges Méliès, the depressed film maker with an incredible back story. On top of these three main incredible performances there is a host of truly terrific supporting characters played by Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Winstone, Christopher Lee and Jude Law. Despite a disappointing box office take, I guarantee Hugo will become a cinematic classic in later years. Please see this, and just let the adventure take you!! 9/10",9,6,8,26 May 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," In its own right, its a ton of fun
","Terminator 3 is a total departure from the first two films. It perfectly fits the storyline and doesn't create too many glaring plot holes from the first two films. The problem is that there is a distinctive lack of brilliant artistic vision behind it. This was made to cash in and is made to be a mainstream action/sci-fi flick. Taken at that value...I love it. Its fun and campy and absolutely non-stop action packed popcorn popping fun. If you love Schwarzenegger like I do...this is bread and butter for fans of his. He comes back swinging as his infamous Terminator role. Much like Terminator 2 there is a lot of campy scenes and they feel just a little more campy this time around but for some reason campy works in the context of this very real world they create. I think the cleverness behind Terminator 3 is that the action is so good and the pace is so fast that you forget its not as clever as the previous two films. This is all about Arnold and continuing the story and sort of a much expected prologue to Judgement Day. I think it would have been a very different film had James Cameron returned to direct but it is what it is and I enjoy it!! Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the Terminator. He is more robotic this time and the low brow humour is toned down but it is lots of Arnold. If you look up the easter eggs in place for fans you'll enjoy it quite a bit. It isn't his most charismatic role and definitely not his best turn as the Terminator (I hope that is still to come with Genisys) but it is still great. While I'm not fond of them having a different John Connor every single time...Nick Stahl actually is really great in the role. He is very serious and brooding and plays the part well. His John Connor is a drifter, trying to find his way in the non-Judgement Day world and you actually believe he could become the Saviour of mankind. He doesn't have NEAR the chemistry with Schwarzenegger that Edward Furlong did but he still plays a good part and leads the cast well. Claire Danes is an interesting character and she plays the part well. She does have good chemistry with Stahl and Schwarzenegger and I actually wish she would come back to the series at some point playing Katherine Brewster. Kristanna Loken is interesting in her role. I always thought this would be her breakout role but she sort of slipped into B-Movie obscurity. She is actually extremely effective as the villainous and deadly T-X. She is stunningly beautiful but there is something campy about her performance too. Still she has few lines and her hand to hand battles with Schwarzenegger are excellent. They make worthy foes and while she isn't near as effective as Robert Patrick was but it works. While they manage to write out Sarah Connor, her spirit is alive and well in the story.If you hold Terminator 3 up against T2 then you will hate...plain and simple. Terminator 2 is easily one of the best sci-fi/action films ever made period and this is a far cry from that. But...its far enough after that film that if you watch it for sheer fun then you can find plenty to enjoy. I'm not sure why they put Jonathan Mostow at the helm of such a potentially big entry in the franchise. He just doesn't have the proper experience. He does alright but when you consider one of the best directors of all time practically created this franchise, you can't hand it off to just anyone. The special effects are a HUGE step down and the CGI is nowhere near the standard T2 set (which is funny considering it was a dozen years later.) I'm trying very hard to hold Terminator 3 on its own and not compare it because I love this movie!! Just have fun with it and enjoy the continuing story because it works and it has a ton of action and its not nearly the mess so called 'die hard' fans make it out to be. Its a step down but still fun. 8/10",8,1,2,18 April 2015
The Shining," Over appreciated film and director butchers the world's most brilliant modern day writer's tale
","I don't dislike The Shining. I just feel, as did King, that Kubrick's The Shining butchered his story and it does exactly that. I guess supposedly The Shining's artistic value is huge being that Kubrick is such a brilliant director but I don't see anything to the film that makes it such a Kubrick masterpiece. The core ideas are still in tact from the film but it seems as though Kubrick rushes everything through and in the process leaves all the meat and potatoes of the characters and the story in the dust. The characters in the film have virtually no depth, they are very shallow characters and the casting for the important roles couldn't have been more wrong. That being said Kubrick's The Shining makes a great horror story and is downright disturbing in numerous scenes. It gets a lot of it's 'classic' status from many of it's more disturbing scenes including the blood in the elevator, REDRUM, the disturbing portrayal of Danny, and of course Nicholson's infamous portrayal of the madman but the problem with all of this is the story around it is so weak. You don't see Nicholson's decent into madness, it practically happens on a dime, and you don't get a sense of the evil hotel, everything just lumps together quickly, and the ending of the film makes such little sense that it leaves you frustrated and scratching your head.Jack Nicholson plays Jack Torrance. Nicholson is a master actor, even nearly thirty years ago he was brilliant on screen and although his performance and character doesn't really match that of the novel he is still a decent choice for Torrance. The problem is Kubrick doesn't give Nicholson any depth to his character at all. So he gets to show sane, and then completely insane with nothing in the middle. Still it's easy to see why Nicholson's performance is so memorable because he is terrific. Shelley Duvall might be one of the worst actresses I've ever seen and casting her in this role might be one of the worst decisions I've ever seen. She is god-awful in this role and not to be mean but MAN is she ugly...holy crap. She was nominated for a Razzie for this role and I usually hate the Razzie's but they were dead on for this performance. She doesn't come close to fulfilling King's novel version of Wendy and she's just terrible in the role. Her facial expressions and downright hilarious acting makes her performance really, really awful. In his one and only performance on the big screen Danny Lloyd plays young Danny Torrance with a certain mundaneness. I mean I give him enormous credit for the scenes where he's 'talking to Tony' and his belting out 'REDRUM' which still gives me nightmares but apparently Kubrick shielded him even knowing he was in a horror movie (which surprises me and I gain a little respect for Kubrick for doing that.) Still Lloyd's performance is just adequate, nothing really huge about it. Finally veteran actor Scatman Crothers plays Dick Hallorann in a small role that isn't even really a 'supporting role' but that's what they consider it. He does alright but doesn't even come close to the terrific role played by Melvin Van Peebles in the King Mini series version. But then his role is very small and like with the other characters, Kubrick gives them nothing to work with.Apparently I'm not a Kubrick fan because if I could pin point one thing wrong with The Shining, it would sum up into Stanley Kubrick who wrote the script and directed the film. I mean the man was rumored to be a monster on set forcing hundreds of re-shoots and yet manages to get no depth to these amazing characters? He focused far too much on the horror aspect of The Shining and missed all of the key elements that makes it brilliant. The film is okay and mostly okay because of Nicholson's performance once he becomes the maniac, and the hedge maze idea is cool but NO substitution for the Hedge animals from the novel and the later mini series. Some people passionately love Kubrick's The Shining but I think it's a matter of feeling like they have to because if you really watch it from a King fan perspective you'll realize there is so much missing and you'll understand why King himself didn't like this version. Still it is a classic and very watchable (except for Duvall's horrendous performance) so definitely see it but read the book and watch King's version of the mini series as well because that will give you a true look into The Shining. 7/10",7,2,8,17 March 2008
Over the Hedge," Hilarious, fun, a rip roaring good time
","It seems like Dreamworks just simply can't make a bad picture. They have revolutionized animation and made them absolute gold in the pocket. Fortunately they truly do make great pictures!! Over The Hedge is a unique, fun, well voiced picture that has just right the morals for young kids, a hilarious script for adults and children and breathtaking animation. All this is told in basically ONE location. The film never leaves the backyard and over the hedge in one small neighborhood. That's pretty impressive to be able to tell a great story without ever changing locations. The script is literally laugh out loud, and they take plenty of liberties with the characters because it's animation and it doesn't have to be even remotely realistic. And that makes it even more fun!! They really know how to make a picture fun for everyone!! I went to see this with my girlfriend and no kids and we loved it!! This cast is just drop dead amazing. Bruce Willis, Garry Shandling, Steve Carell, Wanda Sykes, William Shatner, Nick Nolte, Thomas Haden Church, Allison Janney, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Avril Lavigne. What an incredible job bringing together such a variety of Hollywood stars and they all mesh together perfectly. They also fit their characters 100%. Bruce Willis is terrific (a throwback to his days voicing Mikey in Look Who's Talking) as R.J., a rather self serving raccoon with his own welfare in mind. Willis has a distinct style to his comedy and he brings that out with his voice. Garry Shandling is also terrific as determined leader of the family Verne. Wanda Sykes is hilarious and well voiced as the strong willed Skunk Stella. Thomas Haden Church is really well done as the mean spirited exterminator Dwayne, called in to rid the up scale human neighborhood of the sudden critter infestation.As I said before on the great things about this film is it's story, script and just it's complete set up in general. A group of different animals (Possums, Porcupines, a skunk, a turtle, a chipmunk) all wake up from hibernation to discover that their forest has been cut down in order to make way for a new up scale sub division and now right outside their log where they live separating them from the humans is a HEDGE!! One of the greatest moments in the film is when they're trying to discover what this 'hedge' actually is. The film is so sweet, nicely made, funny, action packed!! There are some genuine edge of your seat moments and every character is adorable and done in beautifully rendered CGI animation. The last animated film I saw was Chicken Little which I also really enjoyed and I'm scored Over The Hedge the same as Chicken Little but Over The Hedge was even better. You've got to see this one!! 9/10",9,0,0,4 July 2006
The Alamo," An okay Epic
","This particular period epic seems to be the popular one to hit the gong for. I heard nothing but bad reviews and people's nasty comments. I had always looked forward to seeing it regardless because I like historical epics and there has been some less than stellar ones as of late. The Alamo didn't disappoint me at all. In fact I thought it was very heartfelt and real rendition of the circumstances surrounding the infamous battle. John Lee Hancock uses the characters sparingly and makes a movie all about the battle which is really what it's about. Despite there being some significant characters he takes a different approach by not being afraid of making them second to the infamous battle itself.The Alamo is the historical story of Texas, before it was Texas. The Americans want the land as does the Mexicans and the only thing standing between them is the small fort of The Alamo, a strategically placed, vitally important abandoned mission where a rag tag group of countrymen have been sent to hold up against thousands of Mexican soldiers led by the Mexican leader himself Santa Anna. Among the American group are infamous historical figures Congressman David (Davey Crockett) and Jim Bowie determined to free Texas and make it part of the United States.The highlight of acting to me in this film is Billy Bob Thorton, a man that I'm not crazy about in his personal life but nonetheless is one hell of an actor. He portrays the now aging Congressman Davey Crockett. He plays the man with such emotion and intensity and as an audience he's the character you feel the most compassion for. He seems wise, and experienced and you can't help but feel like you're in the presence of a legend. Jason Patric also does a good job as the ailing and dying Jim Bowie. He shows strength and hostility as quickly as he shows compassion and weakness. Despite this films apparently numerous historical inaccuracies I still think this film captures this time period and this battle better than most epics do. I think the inaccuracies are ignorable considering the work that Hancock did with the characters and the battle. Despite these characters importance and most of the film spent building them up, he doesn't hesitate to drop them quickly and unemotionally to the spoils of war. It's shocking and makes you snap back when you see someone who has been a main character for the last two hours eliminated in literally seconds. He also focus' in not only on the American side but we see the fear and desperation in the eyes of the Mexican troops. With this different approach to the period piece it does lose a little of what might be dramatic story and therefore does make it drag more than one would like. Also Dennis Quaid, who is one of my favorite actors, is pointless and misused in this film and despite his battle being important, nonetheless feels tacked on and useless by the time it comes around. His character is vapid and has no depth whatsoever. I really do think anyone who loves history or epics will really enjoy watching this. It won't blow you away but there is enough in it to satisfy and I enjoyed watching it.6/10",6,2,2,25 June 2005
Wanted," Stylish and visually stunning but lacking true depth
","I suppose I went into Wanted with decently high expectations. I wanted a hot, action packed action flick this summer and I figured Wanted would deliver. Now that's to say that Wanted disappointed, in fact it was stunning visually with some outlandish and very cool stunts and tricks and plenty of blood and gore and Angelina Jolie's very shapely butt...you can't really talk trash about any of those things. It just felt like they tried to do so much in the film, tried to really make an in your face, intense action film that it suffered a little because of it. The lead character didn't feel like he fit into the grand scheme of the film and he goes through such a grandiose change from average joe to professional killer that it happens too quickly and you lose something from it. They take a really cool idea, something original and drive it home but they over use it again and again. By the time the film is half over you're so tired of the curved bullet fiasco that you don't care. Really I think they took an idea that would have bullets flying, stocked an A List cast and assumed that the rest of the pieces would fall into place without a really strong story and enough content to cover a trilogy.I don't necessarily blame the leading man James McAvoy for his performance. I mean I think he can act but his character has too much going on and goes through such intense changes in a matter of 45 minutes of the film and then only gets the other half to show off and he's just not believable. Sometimes it's fun to see the average joe suddenly kick some ass and the scene where he goes nuts on his slightly over weight boss is absolutely classic but as an action star I just wasn't feeling it. I think he should stick to drama and take some better written roles. Angelina Jolie is everything they wanted her to be in this role. Sultry, seductive, sexy, dark and mysterious but her character doesn't exactly get to let loose with any huge moments and we know she can act. The amazing Morgan Freeman is still amazing and probably one of the best parts of the film as the equally mysterious Sloan and I really wanted to know more about him but they never give you that either. Freeman seems almost frustrated in the movie because they aren't giving him enough to work with. Terence Stamp makes a small appearance, as his second big role of the summer (first being a great role in Get Smart.) While his energy adds to any cast they give him next to nothing as well. Thomas Kretschmann is good as fellow killer gone rogue Cross, but surprise surprise he is given nothing to work with. Do you see the pattern? Director Timur Bekmambetov obviously has a flair for style but it's mostly wasted on what could have been a great story and that's what I wanted from Wanted. It was all these fireworks and pretty displays and then it just fizzled when it was time for the meat and potatoes of the whole deal. He had some real talent involved in this film but it was slapped together for a summer blockbuster which for the most part has been doing well. I'm not telling anyone to not see Wanted because a good action flick is hard to come by and it will entertain you and probably leave that adrenaline feeling in you when you leave the theater but when that dies away you'll be left feeling empty and wondering where the rest of it was. I can't see them doing a sequel to this because I don't believe any of the cast would return but if they did they would have to find a much better writer and a film crew that would be willing to give some depth to a story that has piles of potential. Give the story to Luc Besson and he would have blown you away with it I promise. The twist to the whole story is forced and kind of annoying and doesn't really set you up for it at all. So go see it and be ready for lots of amazing action and some really amazing stunts including some very intense car chases which were wicked cool but just don't sit there waiting for a story to develop. 7.5/10",7,2,6,16 July 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The reason this film sits atop so many others is this....
","I have seen this film dozens of times. I am, and have been for many many years, an insatiable Arnold Schwarzenegger fan and this, of course, is his masterpiece. Terminator 2: Judgement Day is a masterpiece for a number of reasons and a number of people. This film defined film-making for its time. It was the crown jewel on 80's/90's action films and sequels and science fiction and horror and special effects and stylized film making and budget....even if you hate the series or the genre, you have to step back and respect it for all those other things it completely nails. Twenty five years later and the special effects in this film not only stand up but exceed anything you can see today. I hate James Cameron's ego but gosh darn the man is a legend in pioneering film making. The film is stunning. You can watch this again and again with your mouth gaping open at the sheer epic stunning qualities. Now, in addition to that its an incredible story. Its a disturbing and dark vision of the future and the perfect follow up to the classic first film. The list of incredible scenes in this film is never ending. The first time Sarah Connor sees The Terminator again, every chase scene, every battle scene and of course the incredible apocalyptic dream of Judgement Day.Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to his iconic role and he is very different than the first time. In The Terminator he was stoic and brooding and emotionless. This time he returns with far more character and distinctive emotions while still being a cyborg. It can be explained that he has been reprogrammed to have more feelings though its never mentioned. I will also say that his change in character opens the door for him to be just a little bit campy at times and yet somehow it works even given the serious nature of the film because...well he's Arnold Schwarzenegger. Linda Hamilton returns again as well and the woman is the ultimate bad-ass. Sarah Connor defines action heroine. She is beyond tough as nails and her experience in the first film has turned her into a jaded soldier that you can't help but root for. Edward Furlong plays John Connor and he certainly wouldn't have been my first choice to play the role and yet now looking back you can't imagine anyone else doing it. He is the perfect angsty and troubled teen and his dynamic with Schwarzenegger's Terminator is perfect. Robert Patrick is one of the greatest villains in cinematic history as the shape shifting metal terminator T-1000. He is practically void of emotion and is terrifying and brilliant in the role. Joe Morton also deserves mention as Skynet creator Miles Dyson.I can't even fathom what the mind of James Cameron is like. He just seems to envision everything and make it seem so plausible. Terminator 2 has its share of plot holes but even knowing them and watching the film again you forget all about it because the film is so easy to watch. It is non-stop action, absolutely thrilling characters and story and as amazing and iconic as the first film is, this is one sequel that is easily heads and tails above the original. At the same time the movie cannot stand on its own without seeing the first. There is an emotional depth to knowing the events of the first movie and how they connect to this one. Terminator 2 set a bar that perhaps still has not been raised. Easily one of the best films ever made for too many reasons to even count. This is the juggernaut all action and sci-fi should attempt to live up to. 10/10",10,2,4,6 April 2015
Heartbreak Ridge," An Unfortunate stumble for the master of cool
","I start almost every Clint Eastwood film review by saying the same thing...I am convinced I am the world's biggest Clint Eastwood fan. The man is the master of macho and can make the Sahara desert look cool. Unfortunately he isn't perfect and despite directing and starring in this outing doesn't save it from being average at best and just plain bad at its worst. Heartbreak Ridge advertises itself like a war movie but in fact is 90% tough as nails 'teacher' takes a band of unruly 'students' and turns them around and 10% action on an island somewhere. Eastwood growls and grumbles his way through the movie as awkward young marines try to test him. The problem is that the young crew really don't fit into the story. They look like they belong in Dangerous Minds (similar story but very different setting) rather than the Marines. A half hearted attempt to put romance to the film has Eastwood trying to get back together with his ex-wife. Unfortunately the chemistry between everyone in the film is little to none making this barely passable as entertainment. Certainly most of the entertainment comes in the last half hour as team finally mobilizes and goes to war on the island of Grenada.In case I haven't mentioned it twenty times Clint Eastwood directs and stars in the film. There isn't anything wrong with his character, in fact he has quite a bit of depth but he's also not incredibly likable rubbing everyone the wrong way from his ex-wife to his higher ups. It just isn't one of his best roles and far from his strongest. Mario Van Peebles is one of the oddest inclusions in this film. While he has a fun character in 'Stitch', the character makes little sense being in this film. However, Van Peebles and Eastwood actually have some bizarre chemistry that works. Marsha Mason plays Eastwood's estranged ex-wife and unfortunately for her (multi-Oscar nominated actress) her character is barely existent. She is vapid and forced into the story to have some romance and soften Eastwood's character. Arlen Dean Snyder is Eastwood's friend and partner. You certainly get a sense of history between Eastwood and Snyder but they don't explore it any. Snyder is some sort of weak comedy relief. Boyd Gaines is the cocky strong arming Lieutenant that fights Eastwood at every turn and is destined to get shown up in the end.The biggest problem with Heartbreak Ridge is simply that it drags. You expect them to go to battle but it seems like they will never make it. There is also never a pinnacle turning point when Eastwood breaks through to his team and makes them respect him. Instead it just seems he beats them into submission and suddenly they will follow him anywhere. Writer James Carabatsos is a former Vietnam vet but clearly that doesn't necessarily translate to a good film even with a powerhouse director and star. I'm still surprised Eastwood would choose to direct this given the script and plot is just simply not good. It tries to carry itself as dark comedy and a war movie but it never lands in either campy. Overall as much as I love Clint Eastwood I would never choose to sit through Heartbreak Ridge. Every direction it goes with the exception of the last half hour in battle just isn't fun to watch and will leave you wondering when it will all be over. 5/10",5,3,5,28 February 2010
Salt," Take it with a grain of....ha was that bad?
","Salt seemed to have a lot of buzz around it. Mysterious, action packed and fan boys were cooing about seeing it. So I guess I had decent expectations. It was an action film and Angelina Jolie has done them well enough and it had the Bourne angle and feel to it so it should have been exceptional but I think many will agree with me, including the box office numbers that it just turned out to be okay and almost completely forgettable the minute the credits rolled. It isn't a bad film, it entertains for the run time but it really doesn't get the adrenaline rolling, the characters don't truly draw you in and it doesn't have any sort of unique quality that will put it heads and tails above the slew of summer blockbuster. The unfortunate part is that it does try to have a quality in the twisted mysterious story but it takes so many twists and turns and doesn't always feel like it works or that it is making sense. The action scenes are kind of tame and for a summer blockbuster you can't have tame entertainment. I guess kudos should be given because they do really try to give the film a smart, twisty, psychological, and political story.Angelina Jolie is a good actress. I've seen her do some good roles and some bad roles but it seems like in the last five or so years she rests on the laurels that she is Angelina Jolie and that is all that matters. She just doesn't seem to put any meat into the role. She seems almost bored at times and while we know she can do stunts and action she doesn't seem to hit her stride as Salt. Liev Schreiber could have been truly great in this role and instead he is just good, or even okay. The plot and script don't seem to really give him a lot of character to play with but he is still good in the role. Him and Jolie could have great chemistry but again it is just good. Polish actor Daniel Olbrychski should have been a much stronger villain and I think he could have done well but once again...you see the pattern...the story doesn't give him the reigns to be truly great. The supporting cast can all be given the same review that they are likely a great ensemble but the film isn't strong enough to support them. I think they rested on the fact that they had a solid cast and the story would evolve around them but I think that rarely works (don't tell that to The Expendables cast.) At first glance some would say Kurt Wimmer is a great writer have penned some really big films in the last few years but when you start to look at what those films COULD have been you'll see where Salt stumbles. I've seen seven of his twelve penned movies and every one of them I would say...yah it was good BUT imagine what it could have or should have been. I think Wimmer rushes his scripts. Phillip Noyce is no slouch at directing either but I think it relies on the script. He directed two terrific Jack Ryan films in the 90's, and also some good TV in his career. I just noticed while writing this review that they are talking a Salt sequel and I'm okay with that but please lets see some real depth to the characters and a more solid well laid out story. So lets sum all of this up, Salt was not a bad film. It entertained me just fine. But it wasn't amazing and it didn't blow me away and I didn't leave the theater hopped up on adrenaline like an action movie should make me feel. I wanted more. And unfortunately I put much of the blame of writer Kurt Wimmer but then he is the one talking sequel so we might get more of the same in 2012-ish. 7/10",7,0,2,18 August 2010
We're the Millers," Another raunchy comedy that actually works to entertain
","You can't really go into We're The Millers with wrong expectations. If you've seen a trailer or read the summary then you should know what you're in for. It delivers exactly what you would expect. I don't mean that to be a negative thing at all because it is satisfyingly entertaining. It is raunchy, crude, outrageous and fun. It doesn't try to get too sappy in the end although a little heart in a comedy goes a long way as far as I'm concerned. The characters are each fun and outrageous in their own way and everyone works so well together. I hate to get all political but I'm not a fan of the way the film promotes drug use and drug selling but it is a comedy and I am not super sensitive I just feel its worth mentioning. This film falls into place with the similar string of comedies (all of which were good) Change Up, Identity Thief, Horrible Bosses, The Heat (to a lesser extent) so fans of those films will find this one just as satisfying. If I had one major complaint it would be just that there wasn't a lot of truly hilarious moments. The film stayed consistent beginning to end and left me smiling. The outtakes at the end were a bonus and hilarious as outtakes usually are.I've always enjoyed Jason Sudeikis as a comedian but I felt like he really broke out in this role. He proved he was a leading man like Jason Bateman or similar comedians who have done so well. Sudeikis' character was a jerk through and through and mean but funny and sarcastic and somehow through it all he was lovable and endearing!! I thought Jennifer Aniston might not fit in so well with this cast and she sort of did stick out but she did a great job and the chemistry with Sudeikis was shockingly good!! She did raunchy and crude with the best of them and her bizarre turn as a stripper worked in comedy favour. Emma Roberts was awesome as the foul mouthed street kid looking for guidance. She has some of the best lines and shocks with some of her scenes and dialogue. Where did Will Poulter come from and how awesome is he in this movie? He nailed his geeky awkward good kid role and was hilarious. He easily gets the best scenes in the film (the Waterfalls rap, the spider bite, the kissing scene...) he was awesome. He is probably the best performance in the film. This will launch his career I am certain! Supporting cast Ed Helms, Nick Offerman, Kathryn Hahn and Molly Quinn were good to decent. Helms was quite good in a small role as the fast talking, jerk drug kingpin. Offerman and Hahn were good and funny but very predictable and felt like I had seen these characters many times before. Molly Quinn (who I love on Castle) was very boring. Her character was the least interesting and you barely knew she was on screen. She didn't fit the chemistry from this cast who all seem to click so well.Surprisingly Rawson Thurber is relatively new to the big screen. He seems to pull of this together really well and crafted a perfect (if not typical) raunchy comedy. I only say that because it doesn't really bring anything outstandingly new to the table but as a genre film it works. It made me laugh and had a decent story, the cast chemistry was near perfect and it absolutely had some fun moments that I will enjoy watching all over again. Basically if this is your type of comedy then you can't possibly be disappointed. Having seen a couple of trailers I was actually impressed that it didn't give away the entire film or all the funny moments like most comedy trailers do. Give it a chance, its a good solid adult comedy. 8/10",8,2,7,17 August 2013
Apocalypse Now," Mind numbing but I have finally seen the horror
","Here is the irony of this film for me. I am a student of US History and Politics. I have studied the Vietnam war for years. I have quoted this film, talked about it with many people and yet now I am not so sure I have ever watched it until this very day. How bizarre? But it also shows just how embedded this film is into our very culture, the very definition of a classic. How many of us could poke fun or recreate a scene from this iconic film having never seen it? Now the thing is this film was either brilliant or a steaming pile of crap or something in the middle. However, after reading some other reviews I think we all feel this way. I felt like the final closing scenes of Apocalypse Now were just freaking brilliant. It had one of the most ominous, dark, disturbing, twisted ambiances I had ever seen in a film. It was really interesting to read about the incredible issues Coppola had with Brando because it ended up being breathtaking. But really the whole film is that way. It is dark and twisted and often sickening and I don't think I understand a lick of it because from square one you start to lose your own sanity and just go deeper and deeper into sheer madness. In this way the film is brilliant. Entertaining? Somehow no. I mean the film is excessive in everything and so much of it leaves you with a furrowed brow wondering what is happening.You cannot deny Martin Sheen's intensity in this film. He gives a subtle, brooding and disturbing performance. His quiet, steady, deep voice narrating much of the film gives it at least most of its power. Honestly, everyone else that rides the boat with him down the 'Nang' river left zero impression on me. I could hardly tell you the difference between them and their characters are left completely undeveloped and you just know they are there but not much else. This is especially the case when you have such terrific small cameos from iconic actors, some of whom were just starting out. Robert Duvall was brilliant at being complex, insane and basically making no sense at all but in the context of this bizarre film. He delivers one of the most iconic movie lines of all time 'I love the smell of Napalm in the morning,' and makes your eyes wide with how insane he comes across. Dennis Hopper is equally as good and disturbing as photo-journalist who clearly has lost his grip on reality. Hopper's fast talking, neuroses is really fascinating. I think the only thing I have seen Marlon Brando in are films that he small cameos in. I knew the film was leading up to him because everyone knows his infamous role in the movie. He is a powerful force on screen and certainly his charisma makes you take notice of him. I wouldn't say he was amazing in the part but somehow he has become iconic in the role and there is just something magical about his performance so he lucked out in that way.I would certainly never begin to bash Francis Ford Coppola on his film making abilities. The man is a god to the film making community. There is absolutely no denying his style in this film and I would guess that every decision, every shot, every character, every odd thing you see was planned by him to make a statement. If there was ever a film I saw that literally made you feel like you were going down the rabbit hole this was it. There is imagery and metaphors and then in the same breath just in your face message about this war. The film is full of gratuitous violence and bad language and the entire thing seems chaotic. However, that only serves to prove you could study this film for decades and find new things about it or new opinions. I think I expected it to be more entertaining and more mainstream but I am not disappointed to say this is a ferociously intelligent and artistic film that I don't necessarily understand or deserve to understand. Perhaps it is a testament to its time and perhaps you need far more experience in film making to truly appreciate it. Until then I am going with my gut. It is worth seeing for those of you willing to dissect and spend two hours+ scratching your head and analyzing every detail. There is absolutely no denying its classic status. 7/10",7,0,2,2 October 2013
Disturbia," Disturbia does what it promises and makes for a terrific thriller
","From the opening scenes to the death defying close Disturbia is the further thing from your run of the mill teen suspense flick. This is the type of thriller anyone would enjoy going to the movies to see. A strong cast, a well paced story, terrific character developments and enough jumps and shocking suspense to keep you riveted to your seat. Within the first five minutes of the film I promise your mouth will hang open and you jump out of your seat from the terrifying beginning that sets the emotional pace for the rest of the film. Director D.J. Caruso, who is mostly known for his Television work does something really remarkable with this script and creates an impending sense of doom and suspicion that so many critics and fans are comparing to Hitchcock's Rear Window. That's not a bad thing to be compared to, Rear Window is considered by many to be the best suspense film ever made. None of the film makers have claimed this to be a remake or based on but nonetheless the comparison is there and it doesn't mean the film isn't worth seeing. On the contrary Disturbia is perhaps one of the best movies out there right now to see on the big screen and is sure to be a smash.Up and coming star Shia LaBeouf who has a big year ahead of him with Transformers and has been on my radar ever since Holes and The Greatest Game Ever Played grows up a little and plays troubled teenager Kale, who gets himself into trouble when he punches a teacher. In hopes of rehabilitating young Kale the judge sentences him to three months of house arrest using an electronic ankle bracelet that disables Kale's ability to leave any where further than his own yard. That pretty much establishes the tone. LaBeouf is easy to watch on screen, has a commanding screen presence for such a young actor and is very versatile and down to earth. I think any teenager could relate to him and an adult can enjoy his performance thoroughly. Aaron Yoo is kind of the stereotypical best friend, the over zealous, comedian who is almost destined to die at the hands of the killer. But Yoo does a good job and makes you care about his character and is an important part of the chemistry between the main characters. Yoo and LeBeouf have good chemistry opposite each other. Relative newcomer Sarah Roemer makes her starring debut as the eye candy and love interest in the film, Ashley. Right from her first scene they are shooting her waist down from behind and putting her in bikini's and wet clothes and making sure the teenage boys in the audience aren't going anywhere. Granted Roemer is a beautiful girl but fortunately for her and us she shows more depth once she becomes a bigger player in the plot. Roemer and LaBeouf are downright hot together and have a terrific romance and actually adds a whole new element to the story despite the rather creepy way they meet (Kale spying on her from his window.) She also turns in a strong female performance. Carrie-Anne Moss takes a bit of back seat as Kale's frustrated mother. Her role is small but she does well when she's on screen. And finally but certainly not least, one of my favorite character actors Mr. David Morse who has stunned and shocked in so many great performances from TV's House to The Crossing Guard to Bait...he always makes a great bad guy, while still remaining so calm and almost likable. Morse once again brings that to Disturbia as the next door neighbor that Kale begins to get suspicions of. Half of Morse's performance is in his eyes, his body language and his voice. It's just enthralling and hypnotic and you want to like the guy but you easily believe he's a cold blooded killer. He is the perfect adversary to LaBeouf's hero.I don't think there is anyone who can't find something incredibly watchable and enjoyable about Disturbia. The beauty of it is it's layers because it's so much more than just about the neighbor who might be a serial killer. As LaBeouf mentions in one scene 'Welcome to Disturbia' because Disturbia is more than just that aspect. It's the man across the road having the affair on his wife with the maid, it's the new people next door fighting all the time, it's himself being confined to his room and spying on everyone...that's Disturbia. This film is brilliant and a terrific action thriller. Definitely check this one out for a good time at the movies or later on DVD release!! 8.5/10",8,1,3,26 April 2007
Van Helsing," Everyone needs to chill out and enjoy!!
","Van Helsing is not the best action movie I have ever seen, but it's far from the worst. In fact it's one of the better movies I have seen in the last little while. One of the biggest problems with not only this film but most of the current action adventure or fantasy films out there is CGI!! Enough already, it looks like crap, it doesn't look real and it's not impressive. What is impressive is when you watch the original Star Wars trilogy where they had to work to get special effects, blow up models, use miniature creations and puppets. Sadly even George Lucas fell to the CGI disaster in his recent Star Wars films. This is why we aren't enjoying action movies like we used to. In saying that, the CGI in Van Helsing is tolerable if not for any other reason than the story and movie around it. Stephen Somers previous credits including the CGI heavy Mummy series, including producing The Scorpion King. A good series, as good as Van Helsing. The story revolves around Gabriel Van Helsing, a monster hunter working for a secret organization within the Vatican. He has lost his memory and doesn't remember his background at all. The Vatican sets him up on a mission to destroy the monster of all evil...Count Dracula himself who has decided to use Dr. Frankenstein's creation of life to bring to life thousands of Vampire offspring. The only thing currently standing in his way is a bloodline of people determined to destroy him. Van Helsing teams up with the last of this bloodline, the lovely Anna Valerious to stop Dracula once and for all including his three brides, his children, the werewolf he has been using to help kill.One of the best things about this film is it clocks in at just over 2 hours and is not ashamed of that. Finally a film worth paying to see that isn't over in an hour and change. They don't hesitate to tell a story amidst numerous action sequences. The action is literally non stop and certainly far from boring, it's one battle after another, each one creative and original and fun to watch. Van Helsing is played by the amazing Hugh Jackman who is one of the fastest and finest rising stars of recent years. His performance as Wolverine, Leopold, to Stanley in Swordfish has shown him to not be an average action star. He actually acts!! He puts passion and uniqueness into his characters and Van Helsing is no acception. Kate Beckinsale returns in another vampire like movie since Underworld as a kick ass heroine who is determined to avenge her brother's death and kill Dracula with or without help. The romance between Jackman and Beckinsale is very light, barely noticeable but their chemistry together is perfect. David Wenham plays a monk who unwillingly becomes Van Helsing's sidekick. He's funny, and is a great addition to the cast.The cast was excellent, the story line watchable and the action scenes amazing even with the CGI. One of the perfectly amazing highlights of this film was the character and performance of Shuler Hensley who plays Frankenstein's Monster. This is basically one of his first roles and he's one of the only monsters in the film that isn't CGI'd to death. His character is great anti-hero, compassionate and interesting. I would love to see a spin off following his character if done properly. He was without a doubt my favorite character from the film. I have said this many times before but when watching most action movies you have to let go of reality, forget plot holes and errors (although I didn't find any in Van Helsing) and enjoy. This movie was meant to just be enjoyed, and they accomplish that in a big way. Unlike most I thought the ending was perfect for the movie and had no complaints. Basically the movie is definitely worth watching but won't blow you away. Somers did a great job of giving the film the old Universal Monsters feel to it and the opening scene in black and white helped set the tone. It's pretty had to give an old movie feel to a movie like this but he pulled it off by keeping the old familiar characters pretty true to legend. Dracula who was played by Richard Roxburgh looked and felt just like the old Dracula we all know from the old movies. As for sequels the basis for franchise was not put firmly in place for this movie which is a good thing for the most part. Doesn't mean it couldn't be done but most likely 99% likely any attempts at sequels would ruin the film and any franchise. Handled properly with care, that 1 % could turn a sequel into an epic trilogy. That's just my opinion. I hope they don't take that risk and leave well enough alone. Van Helsing is a good movie!!7.5/10",Null,0,1,28 November 2004
Ender's Game," An almost amazing sci-fi epic
","First let me say I loved Ender's Game. I have never read the books, and I don't give a lick about the author's sexual opinions. It bares no weight on a film. Ender's Game was a clean, fun, non-stop action ride that was well acted, well written and the perfect potential beginning to another franchise. There are a few mis-steps to the film but considering how long the movie spent in production it was very good. The pacing for the film in the beginning is a little slow and the entire movie focuses on the young recruits training but it works and I was never bored. Each character is well introduced and most importantly we become completely riveted and enthralled with the character of Ender. The film reminded me so much of Star Wars and I mean that in a good way. It is a squeaky clean movie that young people who love science fiction can absolutely revel in and there isn't anything wrong with that. Die hard adult sci-fi fans might find it a little too simple but it really is just an enjoy time at the movies. The special effects were absolutely solid and nothing looked silly. There were a few times when some of the dialogue felt just a little bit cheesy but nothing that drags the movie down for a moment.The amazing young actor Asa Butterfield is perfect for the character of Ender. He floored me in the film Hugo and now he proves he can be a mainstream action hero with this film. He seems so unassuming and yet he commands the screen when he's on it which makes him perfect for the role. Abigail Breslin is probably one of the biggest hiccups to the supporting cast. I don't dislike Breslin but this role was just cheesy and she spends more time squeezing out fake tears and delivering a really campy role that it drags down her co-stars. Hailee Steinfeld (another young actor I have great respect for) is quite good in her role. The unfortunate part is that its a very small role so she doesn't really get to demonstrate her ability but she is good with what she is given and the chemistry between her and Butterfield is very good but left unexplored. Moises Arias was also very good in his role as Ender's trainer and superior. Arias looks sort of campy but he actually made the role work and was good in it. I am quite surprised that a lot of IMDb reviewers are saying Harrison Ford was disappointing. I am a huge Ford fan and I thought he was terrific. This was his best role in a very long time. Yes, he is a little monotone but isn't that the point? He's a respected and driven Colonel who sees nothing more than the end game battle against this species. I think there was more to explore to his character but I thought Ford was fantastic and the chemistry between him and Butterfield was near perfect. On the flip side I thought Viola Davis (a brilliant actor) was sort of ho-hum in this and I would have liked to have seen more interaction between her and Ford. She was still good in the film. And Ben Kingsley (I didn't even realize he was in the film until he showed up) was decent as the legendary Mazer Rackham. Once again, I think there was more to this character to explore but Kingsley did pretty well and seeing him and Ford together on screen was a cinematic treat.Maybe the biggest issue I had with Ender's Game is not an issue at all. I think I just felt like I wanted to see more, I wanted more of it and more characters and more background and I didn't want it to end. But that isn't a problem is it? That's actually a testament to how well the film came together. Ironically director and screenplay writer Gavin Hood comes from a whole lot of B-Movie straight to DVD schlock but thank goodness for him he proved himself with this that he can handle a big budget. However, it might also be the reason every once in awhile during the movie I thought I saw a little sprout of camp popping up. However, it never takes away from the film. Do yourself a favour sci-fi fans and give this a chance so that we can get another instalment. It is worth seeing in the theatre and bravo to them for not wasting the time on 3D because it is visually spectacular on its own and a solid movie to boot. 8.5/10",8,4,9,6 November 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Solidly entertaining, epically huge and a romping good time
","First I will say quite clearly that Monsters vs Aliens is not the greatest work of animation from Dreamworks, or Pixar for that matter. That isn't said to take away from the film at all just simply a statement of fact. Second of all I knew I wanted to see Monsters vs Aliens in IMAX 3D which I don't often get to see. So I'm sure that influences my opinions as well. The film is monstrously entertainment, great characters, fun adventure and just something everyone can enjoy and that is really the goal of animation right now. I think in some ways the film might have been too much for just one animated movie. The characters are all terrific but seem to have so much more they could have done with them where minor characters were perhaps overused. The film is still a load of fun and could truly be fun for anyone who wants to go. The 3D aspect is truly awesome. They do an amazing job and some of the scenes really stand out. It was awesome to watch the kids around me in the theater really be impressed with the 3D graphics and it was just as much fun for me. I really wanted to reach out and try to touch the 3D object like they were all doing.Reese Witherspoon proves that she has talent beyond acting on the big screen by lending her vocal talents to Susan Murphy and her enormous alter ego Ginormica (love that name.) She has the perfect sweet voice and really makes her character come to life. Seth Rogen is absolutely perfect as less than clever B.O.B. He is one of the characters that I felt got sadly underused which is strange because I would have thought they'd shove Rogen down our throats. Still his character and his silly voice really just made him one of the best characters. Hugh Laurie is just awesome as Dr. Cockroach Ph.D. He is probably my second favorite character in the entire film and could easily carry his own spin off movie I think. The character of The Missing Link was a very important character but not quite as lovable and funny as the rest of them. He had his moments but his character is more serious and flawed adding a touch of the dramatic to the film. In that way I felt like Will Arnett didn't really match his character like the rest of them did. He does well but certainly doesn't get a whole lot of heavy comedy out of the deal. The supporting cast of voices are all perfect for their respective characters including a terrific voice over by Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Colbert (hilarious as the President,) Paul Rudd, and Rainn Wilson who is a much better voice actor than he is an actual actor. Truly my number one favorite character of the entire film...has no voice over at all. He is the single handed creation of the animation artists and that is fuzzy, adorable, mean looking Insectasaurus. One of the greatest scenes in the film and in recent animation is the scene with the giant one eyed robot staring down Insectasaurus across the Golden Gate Bridge...it was a spectacle.Directors Rob Letterman of Shark Tale fame and Conrad Vernon of Shrek 2 fame as well as numerous animated voices, do an amazing job on this story. Both Shark Tale and Shrek are quite obviously terrifically told stories that revolve around bringing these 'cartoon' characters to life and not in a Scooby Doo kind of way but rather making animated features as good, if not better than live action. This story certainly shows some real talent. The characters are brought to life and it's fun and exciting and even touching and manages to pull off a moral message to boot. Not an easy task for a film nowadays. Monsters vs Aliens isn't the best animated feature out there but I think honestly it's mostly due to it's own illusions of grandeur, it just tried way too hard to be perfect but still pulls off excellent. Definitely check this one out for fans of animated movies or watch it with the kids because you will love it as much as they will. 8.5/10",8,0,1,19 May 2009
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A surprisingly fun action gore-fest
","I didn't honestly think I would enjoy Hansel and Gretel. The trailers somehow just didn't appeal to me and I still have trouble accepting Jeremy Renner as a lead star. Even when I started the movie I still wasn't sure but by the end I was definitely sure...it was a blast. Silly at times? Absolutely. And I think entirely on purpose. An absolute R Rated gore-fest splatter-house that I was not expecting at all. I wasn't sure it fit the tone of the film or that it was necessary but you know sometimes its just plain fun to have a just for adults movie that is a guilty pleasure like this one. It was like a Disney Fairytale completely corrupted and torn apart, and I mean that positively. The special effects were decent although sometimes a little over the top but then again everything about this movie was excessive and over the top. The weapons were huge and ridiculous, the characters (especially the witches) were almost campy at times but I swear it was all on purpose. I read a review on here that actually compared this film to Evil Dead and I completely see that!! I mean, the budget is 50 times that of Evil Dead but the campy fun and exaggerated characters and special effects...it was simply fun.I don't dislike Jeremy Renner as an actor. However, I think the guy has struggles to be the leading man. I'm not sure he has the charisma on screen to be THEE guy. He's a good supporting actor (Ghost Protocol, Avengers etc) but I'm not a huge fan yet. However...that being said this was a step in the right direction. His fast talking, quick witted, sarcastic Hansel was fun and a strong character. He still wasn't the best of the twosome. Gemma Arterton was a kick butt heroine. She was like Xena, Buffy, and She-Ra all rolled into one. She showed an intensity and charisma on screen that made her shine in every scene. Pihla Viitala plays Renner's love interest and a mysterious girl that comes to their aid. She does alright in the role but I felt like her role was entirely unnecessary. She was strictly there for a romance and for an obligatory R Rated nude scene. Her performance felt unwarranted. Famke Janssen plays the witch leader and is a great over the top villain. She is not someone who normally plays the villain and she nails it while being completely campy at times but in all the best ways. The multi-talented Zoe Bell also deserves honourable mention as one of the main witches. She looks great and does a decent job without a lot of depth to her character.Bucking the rule of thumb that states a writer who directs his own movie does an awful job Tommy Wirkola crafts an incredibly entertaining experience. While I have not seen Dead Snow I've heard that it is an excellent film and he clearly has a handle on how to craft a funny, dark, twisted fairy tale with a ton of action. He uses the fairly large budget (50 Milllion) to the best of his ability and it works. I can see that this film wouldn't be for everyone. A peer of mine stated that they thought the acting in the film was just awful but I didn't get that at all. I think it all breaks down to how purposely campy the film was designed to be. I think a sequel would be great to watch but at the same time I don't think they could capture what they did here. Is it a brilliant movie? No not brilliant but entirely entertaining and sometimes there is nothing wrong with that. If you're looking for a good R Rated fun night in then this one should fulfil those expectations thoroughly. 8.5/10",8,1,2,12 June 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Brilliant, dark, unhinged, beautifully haunting
","There was so much talk and anger over an 'American' Version of the Swedish version of The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo. I hope that the final product puts much of those angry words to rest because David Fincher scores again with one of the greatest dark mystery thrillers I have ever seen. I went in with mediocre expectations, I have never read the book and don't particularly care to. Everything about this movie simply works, much the same as Fincher did with Social Network a year ago. The beautiful music, the breath taking dark and twisted setting of Northern Sweden, the brilliant characters (edging out any performance from the original film even), and the fact that they held nothing back including the violent rape scene and the vengeance scenes that followed. It is the definition of an epic with multiple stories all surrounding the main plot of an ages old murder mystery. From beginning to end I was riveted and just constantly stunned by the darkness and the gritty feel to the film making it easily one of the best films of the year and I might ridiculously shut out by the Academy for everyone except Rooney Mara.I might have completely given up on the Academy Awards if Rooney Mara hadn't gotten a nomination because in my opinion she single handedly gives one of the best performances I have ever seen on screen. She is brilliant, absolutely haunting, twisted, emotional and driven as the socially inept, deeply scarred but intellectually brilliant Lisbeth Salander. I have no doubt she took a page from the performance of Noomi Rapace in the Swedish version but adds levels that Rapace didn't touch. Daniel Craig proves he's not just James Bond by playing disgraced reporter Mikael Blomkvist. I think he just blew away the role compared to the original Swedish version. He added depth, layer, compassion, and a level of the anti-hero the character was meant to have. His odd but palpable connection and chemistry with Mara's Lisbeth is brilliant. Christopher Plummer adds immediate class to the cast although he has a sadly very small role but does well in it. Stellan Skarsgård is also excellent as Martin Vanger who gives Craig a run for his money. The supporting cast is good enough including Plummer and Skarsgård, but Craig and Mara bury anyone else.As much is the film about Craig and Mara's performance as it is about the setting of this film. Its dark and cloudy and very grey all throughout and it just haunts you and rivets you to the screen. The film isn't perfect, I think setting it in Sweden but having people with English accents is a bit much to overcome but it won't take away from the brilliance of this film. Fincher truly surprised me with Social Network, a movie I had no expectations of and blew me away, and now this film. It isn't for the faint of heart and the rape scene is absolutely brutal, as is the actions she takes after, but you can't but be in true awe of everything this film is. Brilliant! 10/10",10,1,5,25 January 2012
Rocky IV," Truly astounding continuation of the remarkable series
","Rocky IV is an incredible film and completely makes the series worth while. Not only that Rocky IV encompassed such an important message for the time it was made in. It only made sense for America's greatest underdog hero to take on America's most feared opponent...Russia. And Dolph Lundgren completely carried the weight of being Russia and pulled it off brilliantly becoming what I think was Rocky's hands down best adversary. Rocky IV featured more of and better scenes of what made the Rocky series great. Hands down Rocky IV had the best musical montage training scene in the winter scape of Russia, it also had the brutal match between Rocky and the Russian which was the best of his fights without a doubt. It had emotion and death losing one of the great characters from the Rocky series.Sylvester Stallone once again for the third time directs, writes and takes the lead role as Rocky Balboa. Now Stallone has proved numerous times that he can direct and write and yes even act but especially when it comes to Rocky. Nobody knows Rocky Balboa the way Stallone does and I think he does an incredible job of really capturing Rocky at a turning point in his life. His best friend is dead, killed in the ring with Rocky watching, his mentor is gone, his wife doesn't understand him, he has all these riches and is unsatisfied with his career and his life thus far which drives him back to the ring on the other side of the world to prove his strength. Stallone is very emotional and almost moody and quiet as he drives himself against his greatest opponent in a nation that hates him. And finally Stallone looks incredible!! When he finally gets in that ring opposite an equally impressive looking Lundgren Stallone looks built like a rock, the best he's ever looked before or since. The original crew returns once again including the short lived Carl Weathers as Apollo Creed who holds nothing back in his brief yet flamboyant and loud performance as always. Taila Shire as Rocky's wife Adrian who once again for the second time doesn't get as big of a part but she is still vital to the story as she comes around to Rocky's cause and reasons for fighting. And Burt Young returns in his unstoppably hilarious and important role as Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law and friend. They have some very emotional moments together in this film. New to the cast is lovely but very hard looking Brigitte Nielsen (the future real life Mrs. Stallone for two years) as Ivan Drago's wife and promoter. Her hard steely glares and Russian accent makes her the perfect voice to Drago's physical presence. And as mentioned before cult favorite actor Dolph Lundgren is Captain Ivan Drago, the monstrous man who is destroying everything in his path. Lundgren has very, very few lines but the lines he delivers become instant classic 'If he dies...he dies,' and my favorite 'I must crush you.' Lundgren easily looks frightening and towers over Stallone and is impressive to watch fight and train. He plays his role to perfection and is the best Rocky opponent period!! Stallone directs the final battle to absolute perfection. The crowd that boos him and then slowly turns, his moving and politically important speech at the end, and the absolutely damaging blasts Rocky takes from the drug induced pumped up Drago. This film is the reason Rocky after Rocky film has been made because great sequels can be done. I still feel that Rocky IV was aiming more mainstream than the original two but nonetheless it is a terrific film and an absolute eighties classic. You can't see any Rocky without seeing them all but this is worth while!! 9/10",9,1,2,9 January 2007
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A very very big surprise!!
","I have done other reviews of certain films that feature what I have been known to call the Ferrell Comedy Troup. Basically the entire cast of Anchorman. They show up in each other's movies (Wedding Crashers, Bewitched, every Ben Stiller movie) and the lot of them just tend to make movies I can't stand. Steve Carell was one of the more talented members of the Anchorman team although that is saying little to nothing. So I had NO expectations of this film. I assumed it would be of the same caliber featuring many of the same actors from the troupe (after all I already knew Paul Rudd was in it.) I assumed it would be gross out comedy, over the top stupid SNL type skit comedy and I was totally shocked and amazed by what I saw.The 40 Year Old Virgin will likely be a classic sex comedy in the same vein as Porky's or Animal House or Revenge Of The Nerds. Yes the film is all about getting laid, yes some of the jokes are pretty tasteless for those that are weak in the politically incorrect department. Still the film deals with the sex topic and being a virgin in a much more compassionate, funny, laugh out loud kind of way. Whereas I full expected Carell's character (the virgin) to be the butt of all jokes, instead he repeatedly comes out on top, above all the other supposedly 'macho' guys and he is the nice guy who finishes first. A lot of the comedy rather than being the gross out type (which there was some of) was more about the actual script, some great dialog and funny moments. One of the real stars of the film was Paul Rudd who plays one of Carell's best friends David. His character was so incredibly hilarious. I had no idea Rudd had this kind of physical comedy in him. His expressions and dialog were just hysterical. The four main characters played by Carell, Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen have great chemistry, far better and far more real than the annoying Anchormen cast (which three of those four guys were in.) They all had unique characters and had some unique and funny moments with Carell as they try to 'teach' him to be a lover.Romantic leading lady to Carell's character was Catherine Keener who I thought was okay. She did the job adequately and had decent chemistry with Carell, I just thought she wasn't the best addition to the cast. Director Judd Apatow who had done mostly TV work obviously knows comedy. He used the right amount of physical comedy, gross out comedy and the sudden rage of politically incorrect stereotypical racial comedy that offends some people and amuses others. Honestly I think I enjoyed this film more than Wedding Crashers and definitely found it funnier. The cast worked well together and more importantly the script is a complete surprise and not brain dead whatsoever which is a complete shock. To discover right up until the very end that this guy who is a virgin is a good thing and makes him a hero of the film is such a refreshing twist to what I imagined it would be like. Key scenes is Carell's chest waxing (which you think would be a drag after seeing it so much on the commercials...it's NOT, it's hilarious), all of Paul Rudd's scenes, Carell's trying the condoms, and all the physical comedy throughout. This is a real keeper and adults will love it's humor and I really think it's destined to become a sex classic. 8.5/10",8,3,6,27 August 2005
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Original and fun comedy with a slow, stumbling execution
","I read the first line of another IMDb reviewers entry and it really summed up everything about this film. 'Quirky Premise, clunky execution.' That is exactly what The Men Who Stares At Goats delivers. Much must be said about the originality, the dark, quirky humor and just the fact that it mostly pokes fun at itself. The cast is solid and the sarcastic one liners are rampant. Given a more fluid running plot, and some more time spent connecting the dots this could have been a real cult comedy in the same vein as O Brother Where Art Thou (also a Clooney film.) Things just never really take off and some of the humor which is written very cleverly is often delivered awkwardly and clumsily. The characters almost entirely portrayed by really brilliant actors are not nearly as in depth as they could have been. All that being said the film still is awesomely entertaining, and has some genuinely fun moments. In the grand tradition of certain types of films many of the truly funny moments in the film are covered entirely in the trailer but they are still fun to watch and you'll still laugh a lot. I also think this if the type of film that some will absolutely love and others will wonder why.Ewan McGregor plays wide eyed and naive reporter Bob Wilton. McGregor almost plays the role too dumb. But fortunately he also plays it very lovable and fun and he's easy to watch perform on screen. His chemistry with other cast members is lacking but as I will cover this isn't just McGregor. George Clooney gives a solid performance as quirky psychic soldier Lyn Cassaday. Clooney's Cassaday much like McGregor's Wilton come across as slow and clumsy but its an endearing factor to the characters. Their chemistry between them isn't great but it isn't bad and much of the humor comes from their interaction and adventure. As a total side note I would have loved to have seen Brad Pitt play the McGregor role because of the chemistry and Pitt can play quirky. The legendary Jeff Bridges plays leader of the psychic military squad Bill Django. He's a great character and a blast to watch. I almost wish the story focused more on him because his character and Bridges are terrific. Kevin Spacey also joins the troop in a small almost cameo role and he always is great on screen but is hardly used and his character is one that gets very little depth. I also have to mention Stephen Lang (now infamous for his role in Avatar) is also in the film in a small role but he is terrific.There isn't a ton of experience behind the film makers in this case. Writer Peter Straughan is new to the big screen and director Grant Heslov is a long time actor but new director. However he's had his hand in a lot of films over the years either behind the screen or in front of it. Seeing that the author of the original novel Jon Ronson has done some directing I think they might have been better off to have direct his own work because perhaps he would deliver it better. Perhaps I sound like I'm harping on the film and I shouldn't entirely be doing that. The film is still fun and for a unique and different comedy you don't have to go anywhere else. Indie film lovers and someone tired of raunchy, silly comedies will truly enjoy a new fresh perspective. It just doesn't reach the level that many thought it would before its release. 7/10",7,2,4,17 February 2010
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The new millennium's James Bond...keep em coming
","I think the Mission Impossible franchise is the only truly great action franchise still left. I mean, this started in 1996 and literally has only gotten better over two decades. Star and Producer Tom Cruise doing his own insane stunts, amazing action, plots filled with gadgets and espionage and terrorism, explosions, hand to hand combat and the newest entry, Rogue Nation felt more like a James Bond film than ever and I mean that in the most complimentary sense. Cruise's Ethan Hunt is as good as James Bond has ever been and that franchise has been around for decades. They have never rushed out a Mission Impossible film, they seem to take care and timing and make sure they find the right director to tell the story. They maintain continuity and characters returning and Rogue Nation is as balls to the wall as its ever been. It isn't the best in the franchise (that goes to MI:3 in my books) but it is absolutely the action film of 2015. I went in with high expectations and nothing was left unmet. I was floored by the action and story and incredible visuals and stunts. If you've seen one great car chase scene, you've seen them all and yet here comes Mission Impossible with a fresh take that has you clutching the seat with both hands.I've never stopped liking Tom Cruise. The man is thee vision of Hollywood. He has had a decades spanning career with some amazing films. Look at his acting credits and find a 'bad' movie, or a movie that didn't do well. Despite her personal life, people seem to keep coming back to see him. He has an undeniable chemistry on screen and he commands your attention. His Ethan Hunt is an unstoppable killing and espionage machine. He is as good as ever in Rogue Nation. He shows intensity and skill but is also the perfect hero to root for. Jeremy Renner also returns from his debut in Ghost Protocol. Initially I have never cared much for Renner and yet he seems to be coming around to having more of a personality on screen. He was much better in this years Age of Ultron and I actually liked him way more than MI:Ghost Protocol in Rogue Nation. His role isn't huge and he doesn't get in the way but he's a decent addition to the cast. Simon Pegg is fantastic returning as Hunt's buddy and partner Benji. They don't overuse his comedy but he fits in so well which you don't expect. Ving Rhames who has at least cameo'd in every Mission Impossible returns in a bigger role. He doesn't exactly stand out in the cast but somehow has a presence you can't help but notice. Sean Harris is our villain this time around and he is decent. But unfortunately only decent. This is a series that has always had really great, bad-ass villains and Harris is good but not amazing. He pales in comparison to say Phillip Seymour Hoffman from MI:3 Still the film is more about the Rogue Nation as a whole so he still makes a solid big bad. Rebecca Ferguson is our Bond girl this time around...oops I mean Mission Impossible girl. Ferguson is good and actually proves herself to be a very good action heroine. This could actually put her in a starring position soon. Her and Cruise have good chemistry and they don't complicate it with romance. Alec Baldwin (who I initially thought would be annoying in the film) pulls off a pretty decent small role as CIA Director.Christopher McQuarrie is definitely a director that I have my eyes on. He has an old school action style that I absolutely love. He's been a great writer for years and often worked on Tom Cruise projects but in only two films he has really impressed me. The first one was Jack Reacher which I thought was amazing and I'm praying her returns to helm the sequel and now Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation. He isn't afraid to tell a story with a lot of depth and expertly wraps intense action around that story. So many directors struggle with that in action films. How can you have breathless action and still tell a great story? Well here it is. Every Mission Impossible film comes up with a new 'insane' stunt or scene and Rogue Nation is no different. This action series sets itself apart and Rogue Nation was fantastic. 9/10",9,2,6,28 August 2015
She's the Man," Roll in the aisles funny, a real blast!!
","She's The Man was everything I wanted it to be and maybe even a little more. I love the teen type 'chick flick' films and I knew this one would be great!! In the same vein as 10 Things I Hate About You (one of my all time faves) She's The Man is a unique, well written, very well performed comedy with some of the funniest lines, and physical comedy I have seen in a long time. It's probably the funniest movie I've seen this year (with the exception of the hilarious Pink Panther.) But She's The Man is actually a more intellectual funny and most of the humor relies on the witty script, 'Three's Company' style story of mistaken identities, and mixed messages, and the cast.Amanda Bynes is a star!! Even since the days of the horribly campy (yet strangely entertaining 'The Amanda Show', she has shown a brilliant talent for comedy. She's probably one of the most talented comediennes out there. Her style of physical comedy, impersonations, and witty dialect makes her hilarious. Previously her big screen debut (where she was the star) was the rather hilarious and well made 'What A Girl Wants.' If that wasn't her break out vehicle than She's The Man takes care of that hands down. Bynes is really the ultimate girl next door. It's a shame she doesn't do more big screen work because she could be the next 'It' girl. She is the All American, cute, down to earth, bubbly teen (although she's twenty now) and whether or not she'll be able to carry her talent and style over to being an adult actor will remain to be seen. But for the purpose of this film she is perfect!! She actually legitimately pulls off the rather outlandish plot of her impersonating her twin brother and makes it believable. Not entirely...but believable enough. Most of the script relies on the comedy of her errors trying to be a guy but it's just hilarious, non stop laughs. Channing Tatum redeems himself from his deplorable performance in 2005's 'Havoc' by plays Duke. He's the jock, the captain of the soccer team, and eventually Bynes' object of affection, unfortunately he's also Sebastian's room mate (who is Bynes.) He's a good leading man, and the chemistry is perfect between them. Laura Ramsey is Olivia, who happens to be attracted to Sebastian (who again is Bynes.) She does good as well although her part is small and she doesn't really effect the rest of the cast one way or another. James Kirk is great in his small role as the real Sebastian. His resemblance to Amanda Bynes is astonishing...they are absolutely believable as twins and further more, from a distance you could understand someone believing Bynes is Sebastian. The rest of the cast all fit in there somewhere and their roles range from brief to more supporting but essentially they are all supporting the story between Bynes and Tatum but everyone is more or less supporting Bynes terrific performance. She easily carries the film with no hesitations and makes it worth while.This is one of those films that shows so much in the trailer and yet it's not one of those films that when that part comes up it's not funny anymore. The parts in the trailer that make you laugh are even more hilarious in the actual film. Relative newcomer director Andy Fickman does such an incredible job on this film. He weaves together a potentially complicated storyline and makes it flow naturally and makes everything fall together. The story which is loosely based off of Shakespeares Twelfth Night but it's remarkable how much they managed to translate over to this modern day film. It's seemingly completely off the wall but more exact to the classic comedy than you'd think. There isn't too much to say about a downside except that the last half hour drags a little and also becomes a might predictable but it doesn't change the hilarity of the first half of the film. Nonetheless you'll be laughing to tears and it's one of the funniest films in the theater right now hands down!!! 9/10",9,69,87,20 March 2006
Spider-Man," Amazing Spiderman!!
","I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not 'Comic Book-ize' the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...'with great power, comes great responsibility.' This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10",9,0,0,8 May 2002
Jarhead," Powerful war epic with extreme political message
","Jarhead is probably one of the most controversial films I have seen this year...if not ever. I will make a bold statement and say that 'Jarhead' will be for this generation what Apocalypse Now was for the Vietnam Generation. Without a doubt it will become a classic war film talked about for years. I didn't have a lot of expectation going into the film so it surprised me in many forms. I honestly didn't believe for a moment that actor Jake Gyllenhaal could impress me or pull off the role in this film. Jarhead seemed to me to be far grittier, and tougher than what I would have thought Gyllenhaal could do. I was very, very wrong.In fact Gyllenhaal is excellent in the lead role of Swoff, a 20 year old soldier who chooses the Marines instead of college and then realizes far too late he might not have made the right decision. He leaves behind his youthful existence, his beautiful girlfriend, all for the sake of The Marines. Gyllenhaal only plays the new kid for a brief moment before he truly is one of the toughest sons of bitches there. He's hungry for action, he takes care of his new family, he trains, he follows, he leads, he nearly loses his mind and he is so incredibly watchable while doing it. He even overshadowed Jamie Foxx. That's not to say Foxx didn't pull off yet another incredible performance as Staff Sgt. Sykes. He's very tough on the men, a great trainer but deeper than that he's a great soldier and it shows. His deep set patriotism and love for the marines does show through in everything he does. Gyllenhaal definitely gets more of the performance though because his character goes through so many ranges of emotions. His performance is jaw dropping. Now let's talk supporting actor Peter Sarsgaard. He's been making a name for himself in the last year or so as the good guy who turns out to be a bad guy and I can't say I've particularly enjoyed his performances thus far. And yet here he is breaking that mold for me. His performance as Troy, the troops leader, is also stunning. His performances have always been very bland to me and at first I thought Jarhead would be no exception until you get to the meat of it all and he pulls off an Oscar Worthy performance. His emotions, and character will make you feel it. His scene opposite Dennis Haysbert of 24 fame (well at least that's where he gains his fame with me) was powerful!! Each character in this film and in their unit were so different, and gave us a different angle of the war and how each one of them felt, what they gave up, their lives before, during, and even after the war and the marines.That's the brilliance of Jarhead. Sam Mendes made a war film that is against war, and a war film where there is very little war but rather the deep seeded effects of war. From the enemy, to the American, to the innocent civilians. The scenes of the decaying corpses on the roadside will make you sick and the symbolism and imagery in this film is just stand out!!! He doesn't stop at just showing us a war, he takes us on the entire life path of a solider. Beginning to end. He even shows us the side of the solider that so few war films ever show and that's after it's all over, the effects they have, how it changes their lives forever. 'No matter what a man does, he will always remember the rifle.' This is not your average popcorn and a movie kinda flick. This is far more intelligent than some will realize. The only downside to it is that it gives 'swear like a solider' a whole new meaning because the language in the film will make your ears bleed. It's horrendous. Lately I've really come to wonder about the portrayal of the American Military in films. After seeing films like Tigerland and even this film the conditions in the military are horrendous. Is it really like this?? I'd love to know. I understand the conditioning of a solider and even why they would behave this way but still a film like this would make anyone shy away from ever wanting to join the military but isn't that the goal?? Isn't that the message here that these men and women love their country so much that they put their lives on the line and do whatever it takes only to be taken advantage of?? I don't know...right or wrong, I'm not on here to make that argument, only to say that Jarhead will make you think!! It's the greatest conversation piece in cinema in a very long time. I hope this film sweeps the Oscars because despite the political message and the hidden agenda that does exist, the performances are powerful and amazing. It does drag a little at times, and I'm not sure a single shot is fired which makes it all the more unique but you can't miss out watching these amazing actors. The film has humor, intense drama, horrifying scenes and captivating setting. The scenes shot around the burning oil wells are spectacular. Anyone wanting to see the most intelligent film of the year needs to check out Jarhead.",9,4,6,7 November 2005
Dunkirk," Probably well filmed but a messy film to follow and take in
","War films are similar to Westerns, we just don't see many of them anymore. While I do believe Christopher Nolan did some incredible films, I felt like after the Batman franchise his ego overtook talent and now he thinks everything he makes is gold. I thought Dunkirk would just be a solid, potentially moving film about an important battle in World War 2 history. Some reviews seem to indicate that is what some people saw. To me, it was a story with good cinematography, impressive practical effects, a rousing score but empty characters, a non-sensical and pointless chaotic chronological plot and a slow pace. I get that the point is to focus on all the men and the event as a whole and that works but in order to get truly invested as a movie goer, I think you need some character development and hero or heroes that you care about and I couldn't even tell you a single name in the film. The performances are all perfectly fine but the script is non-existent. They are just faces on a battlefield and it's very hard to connect with the incident. Towards the end of the film there is a big moving moment when the civilian boats arrive and there are tears in the eyes of the soldiers and I felt nothing. It was like watching a documentary but even less connecting. There is a lot of newcomers on the cast, done on purpose by Nolan to get fresh faces, and then a few names. Fionn Whitehead, Damien Bonnard, Aneurin Barnard, Barry Keoghan, Mark Rylance, Tom Glynn-Carney, Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Harry Styles (Yep that Harry Styles) and Jack Lowden are the main cast. Mark Rylance probably gives the best most memorable performance. He might be the only one you really get a back story on or something to actually understand him from. Everyone else gets plenty of screen time and some good scenes of fear and emotion but the lack of dialog and climactic scenes leaves you confused about whose who. I knew Tom Hardy was in the film but barely realized it was him until the end. Kenneth Branagh gives a very small, woefully underused part but has solid emotion to it. Harry Styles does a great job in his role as well. The film teases a few twists to the characters but it's so painfully forced down your throat that finding out otherwise is almost expected. Christopher Nolan has done some of the biggest films of our generation. He also did some of the most brilliant (Inception, Memento) but as he continues to make films he goes bigger and bolder and uses elaborate pontificating tricks to make his films seem so great. The reality to the movie going public of 70mm film or whatever it is being important is pretty low I think. I do really respect him for practical effects because I think CGI and Digital is way overused. The scope of the battlefield and the air fights and the ships on the water are all really well done. The claustrophobic feel of some of the scenes really is good. It's just lacking the connect that draws you into the battle. You won't find yourself invested in any of the characters period. I'm surprised this wasn't a November release for awards season though we will likely see it in the technical awards. 6/10",6,5,7,17 August 2017
The Machinist," Captivating but not entirely unique
","The Machinist may have never been released if not for the sudden stardom of Batman star Christian Bale. But fortunately for us it is. However I don't think the film is ever a surprise to anyone. It's kind of the typical twisted psychological thriller you expect. Nonetheless it has some great performances and a dark overtone that makes it interesting enough to watch even though most people won't ever wonder about the outcome. That's not to say that the film is not open to interpretation. This type of film (see also the amazing The Jacket) is fun because it can be discussed and argued about and open to many different theories. Is this death?? Is he in some sort of purgatory where he must choose redemption or death?? The Machinist is the story of Trevor Reznik a machine operator at 'National.' Reznik hasn't slept at all in over a year. He's barely a shell of a man, thin as a skeleton and gradually losing grip with reality. The only people in his life are Stevie the hooker who has fallen in love with him, and Marie, the waitress at the airport coffee shop he frequents every late night. Everything begins to truly fall apart when while on break Reznik meets Ivan, a burly man who apparently has taken over for one of the other guys at National. Reznik doesn't remember ever seeing him. When back in the shop Reznik sees him again and gets distracted while helping another guy fix one of the machines. In a freak accident Reznik backs into the safety and the other guy loses his arm. Trevor's world begins to fall apart. Haunted by causing Miller's accident he begins to believe someone is trying to mess with him and Ivan (who the factory boss informs him does not work at National and doesn't exist) is the key to it all. Reznik's world spirals out of control and gradually we are introduced to elements of his world over the past year that has caused him the grief and guilt that has made him the man he is today. He will have to make the final choice between his redemption and the continued guilt for the rest of his life.The Machinist is dark, slightly twisted and most definitely haunting. Christian Bale is amazing as Trevor Reznik. He looks just horrible, deathly skinny, ailing and he looks like someone who hasn't sleep in a long, long time. But not only does he look the part but creates the roll of a desperate man who seems like your average guy. He's honest, hard working, a lover, no drugs, not a drinker...seemingly average but as the story unfolds we learn so much more about him. The supporting cast is also very well cast. Jennifer Jason Leigh who I am not a huge fan of does an adequate job playing Stevie, Michael Ironside and John Sharian play brilliant supporting roles especially Ivan who is haunting and deadly. The Machinist is a great thriller, it's absolutely worth watching but unfortunately I found it a little typical. I never once questioned the outcome of the film, only which aspects were real and which weren't. There are some genuinely interesting enough action scenes interspersed throughout the film and the gritty world in which it takes place is captivating. You feel each character's problems. Brad Anderson does an amazing job portraying this. For any fan of a Psychological thriller, Christian Bale or something a little off beat, check out The Machinist, you won't be disappointed. And then check out my review and the film The Jacket, something comparable but worlds above. 8/10",8,2,2,4 July 2005
The Intouchables," Lovely comedy drama whose heart and soul lies in the lead characters
","The Intouchables took the world by storm especially for a 'foreign' film. I anxiously waited to see it and I'm so glad I got to. Not only is it one of the best movies I've seen in quite some time but it was deep and touching and funny! It was certainly the best foreign film I have seen in quite some time. It was one of those movies that I think lucked out in the magic department and everything just worked perfectly to create that uncontrollable chemistry that draws people in. The story isn't incredibly unique, we've certainly seen the two people from different worlds forging a friendship before. We've also seen the fish out of water tale of a person from a different social and economic circle thrust into upper class. What makes this beautiful and simply and touching is the absolutely palpable chemistry between Driss and Phillipe played brilliantly by the two lead actors. Whomever made this film completely lucked out finding two actors who are polar opposites physically and have them work so incredibly well together in this movie. I didn't want the movie to end. I wanted to watch their friendship continue and watch more adventures with them, they captured me that much.This year at the Oscars I thought they REALLY struggled to pick quality performances. There were a few truly outstanding nominations that I agreed with but most were barely supporting actors and still got nominated (Amy Adams, Alan Arkin etc) but they sincerely and unequivocally overlooked both of the stars of this film. François Cluzet is mind blowing as Philippe. The man is completely paralysed and creations emotions, empathy, sadness, happiness, laughter, love, fear, social anxiety...all with his facial expression and his eyes. He gives an incredible performance just in his eyes alone. You feel every single thing he does simply because he absolutely nails this performance. Omar Sy looks and acts the polar opposite of Philippe and yet their chemistry is unbelievable. Sy is hilarious, fast talking, street wise, rough around the edges and emotional. He captures your heart as quickly as he does for Philippe. You understand both of them and watch this incredible bizarre and perfect relationship unfold. Audrey Fleurot and Anne Le Ny were excellent as supporting characters to Philippe and Driss. I wanted to see more from both of their characters and more between them and Driss because they both had very unique relationships to him.They would have screwed this up but this would have made one incredible TV Series. There was so much content and so much emotion that it could have been an amazing, long running series. But we have this film and it is just incredible. Perhaps my single only critique is that they added some elements of story that got in the way because they never truly get wrapped up or taken care of properly. Philippe's daughter was a very interesting idea but the film is simply too short to deal with that whole relationship so it feels rushed and awkward including Driss' threatening her ex-boyfriend to be nice to her. But that is a very small issue when you look at the big picture. Co-directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have solidified their directorial and writing careers with this film. They will be monstrously huge now and be able to do anything they want. Their direction is terrific and their story is even better but they truly lucked out with Cluzet and Sy because they took this story and created something magical. I don't often talk about the music in a film but the truly lovely and haunting melody from this film sets the tone of the movie and will almost certainly bring tears to your eyes. Whether you love foreign films or are just not jumping into them...this is a reason to because it is amazing. 9/10",9,1,2,5 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A feat of movie making that continues an outstanding series of films
","Harry Potter is a phenomenon. The books and the films, although I haven't yet read the books. I am convinced that one of the reasons behind the success of these films is that they are the only enormous epic adventures made for kids that don't make them feel like kids. Sure Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks CRANK out the huge films but they are cartoons and made with kids in mind. The Harry Potter series (especially the last two installments) including Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban gives children and adults who love fantasy a very serious epic with no holds barred, it doesn't feel toned down or edited for content but rather very real and intense and scary at times, exciting, masterful, and brilliant. Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón takes the helm from director Chris Columbus and gives the series a serious boost in maturity which it definitely needed. Harry is older, his friends are older, the story is darker and his fans watching it have aged too quite likely. Cuarón gives it exactly the dark edge it needs. There is no doubt he is a far more mature director and perhaps even too dark himself to take on a children's movie such as this but he does it and flawlessly.One of the amazing and terrific things about the Harry Potter films is the cast that always seem to return for every film so far and the addition of new characters as well. Daniel Radcliffe takes his third turn as the boy wizard Harry Potter and nails it home once again. Radcliffe was absolutely BORN for this role. He might get typecast for the rest of his life but he should be blown away by his accomplishment of embodying a literary legend such as Harry Potter. His intensity, sadness, power, hidden talents all shine through and no one else could nail the part like he does. Rupert Grint also returns as Harry's best friend, the terminally nervous and jittery Ron Weasley. His role seemed to be slightly less in Prisoner of Azkaban and that might be perhaps because his role is comedic at times and takes a bit away from the edge of the dark tone of the film. Still he does a terrific job and really nails his role as well. The third in the trio is the terrific Emma Watson. I wish she would do something else in films because I think she is extremely talented. Her performance as Hermione Granger not only gives young girls someone to root for but really puts a bite into the story. She's feisty, strong, easily stands up to the testosterone driven cast and she's fantastic. Veteran actor Michael Gambon graciously and flawlessly takes over the role of headmaster Albus Dumbledore from the late, great Richard Harris. Not only does Gambon look the part (kudos to the make-up and costume teams) but he does such an incredible job and performing the role exactly the way Harris did. A strong, mysterious, caring, powerful wizard. You don't even notice the switch between actors which truly is great compliment to not only Richard Harris but Gambon as well. Robbie Coltrane returns in one of my favorite roles as Hagrid, a loving, caring giant of a man whom the kids always turn to in trouble. Now a professor Hagrid doesn't get a whole lot screen time but still shines when he's on there. Coltrane embodies the character like the rest of the them. Alan Rickman returns as Snape, the professor everyone loves to hate. Rickman doesn't get a lot of screen time either but Snape is a great character and Rickman is perfect for it. The two big additions to the cast are David Thewlis as Harry's new found mentor Remus Lupin. Thewlis fits right in and has great chemistry opposite Harry Potter alumni especially Daniel Radcliffe. And Gary Oldman who until recently I have never been a fan of. I always found him rather dry and boring, and always confused him with John Malkovich for some reason?? But Oldman does a terrific job and is barely recognizable as the misunderstood Prisoner Sirius Black. He is convincing as being a terrible murderer but easily switches to being misunderstood and cared for by the audience as well as Harry.There are so many brilliant things about The Harry Potter series. I happen to think just now with the third and fourth installment the series is really taking off. Prisoner of Azkaban is an easy 10/10 and Goblet of Fire was EVEN BETTER!! a 10+/10. For a film series to get better three or four films in is a rarity especially this incredible!! The special effects are far beyond special effects. They create this incredible world at Hogwarths and beyond that just sucks you in and makes you a part of it and makes your imagination come alive. The beautifully created creatures such as the incredible Buckbeak, and the trees that come alive, the castle, the school, the magic...everything just falls into place and creates this epic with children in mind but so brilliantly done that every single person can adore it!! Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban is brilliance unprecedented in film history. You must see this installment!! 10/10",10,0,1,20 June 2006
Bad Teacher," Bad Movie, Bad Cast, Bad everything...and yes Bad Teacher
","I have to start by mentioning a review I read that called out how they related to the lead character in Bad Teacher...yah that would make you a masochist and psychotic. I know that rude and over the top crude comedies are all the rage right now and its easy to see why because sadly they are insanely popular (Bridesmaids, Hangover etc.) but this is just plain stupid. Bad Teacher gives us one of the most unlikable, stupid, main characters I've ever seen in a film. You expect that something profound will happen that will change her and make her a better person but that never happens and then just to add to the stupidity someone actually falls for her which makes no sense because the character does not have a single redeemable or attractive quality. She lies, cheats, steals, does drugs, sleeps her way through men...and somehow that's supposed to be funny? The only redeemingly funny part of the film is the over the top performances by some of the supporting cast because otherwise this would literally be the worst movie I have seen in MONTHS, maybe years. I can't believe this trash made money.I am not a big Cameron Diaz fan but she has done some really good films. She is better than this absolute crap where she plays the bad girl and looks ridiculous doing it. She's too old to be playing this sort of juvenile and stupid character. There's Something About Mary was probably one of the grossest crude comedies I've ever seen and even that was miles above her performance in this crapfest. She should be given every Razzie award for giving us this awful character. Lucy Punch plays the high strong, annoying fellow teacher who is optimistic about everything except Diaz. Her performance at least gives you some smiles although she really grates on the nerves by the end of it. Justin Timberlake plays the shy and insatiably positive substitute teacher and is probably the single only redeeming performance. Timberlake is a great comedian and its unfortunate he got caught up in this trash. Jason Segal is a master of gross out comedy but he is completely underused in this film and he is stuck with a character who blindly falls for this beast of a 'woman' for no reason at all. What does he like about her? Her violent streak? Her acting like a whore? The drug problem? The romance is dead in this film completely and their chemistry is less than zero. The best part of the film are the small roles played by supporting cast members Phyllis Smith and John Michael Higgins who are actually funny in their roles. Unlike most public school comedies, the kids are hardly used whatsoever but that's not surprising giving how adult the comedy is in the film. But they still manage to be completely inappropriate towards children in the film.Director Jake Kasdan helms the picture and I'm genuinely surprised because he comes from a lengthy career in directing Television with cult favorite 'school' dramedy Freaks and Geeks. He's also one of the minds behind this seasons terrific new comedy New Girl. I can only imagine he was tricked into this as was everyone else involved. You can't really blame the writers either because co-writers Gene Stupnitsky, and Lee Eisenberg come from writing The Office but after this garbage turn Ghostbusters fans should be really afraid that these two are writing that screenplay next. Bad Teacher is utter crap and I hope to never see it again. There is some very minor moments of guilty laughter but my only hope in mankind is that this is only scored a 5.8 on IMDb which is still too high. Do yourself a favor and seek out something much better. 4/10",Null,8,16,12 November 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Completely unnecessary but still entertaining enough
","Going back a few years when Sam Raimi's Spiderman released it was jaw dropping. It was sort of the spring board for the current excess of superhero films we see now. Most of us were definitively disappointed in Spiderman 3 but disappointed enough that we thought it should end the franchise and encourage a reboot only TWO years later? Fortunately for them the reboot isn't so bad and actually very entertaining and spidey fans won't be disappointed. I don't think its nearly as good as the original Raimi's Spiderman but then at that time it was new and fresh and captivating to see a live action, non-campy superhero on screen. The Amazing Spiderman does manage to make itself different enough to make you not feel like you're watching something you've seen a dozen times over. Its a different spin on the Spiderman story while still keeping key elements firmly in place (maybe Marc Webb should give Zack Snyder a few tips.) They also establish enough back story to make this a lucrative franchise for at least three films if they don't screw it up some way and get it scrapped like they did the first time around. At the same time of being different enough it isn't really that far fetched from Raimi's trilogy. It still has the same feel and intensity and solid special effects. As someone who despises CGI I didn't find it silly or overused (though its clearly used a lot) its done very well including The Lizard who is complete CGI.If they absolutely had to do this then Andrew Garfield was a great choice for the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman to a lesser extent. Its funny because I always thought Tobey Maguire made a great Spiderman but lacked as Peter Parker and Andrew Garfield makes a great, awkward, angsty teen Peter Parker but lacks something significant as Spiderman. I don't know what it is...but its something. Still he is at least good in both roles. Emma Stone is terrific as Gwen Stacy. Her chemistry with Garfield is perfect (though again not quite as good as Dunst and Maguire) and she shows once again why she's one of the best young talents in Hollywood. Stone outdoes herself in her role. Rhys Ifans is also perfectly suited as our villain Kurt Connors/The Lizard. Playing a villain (especially a giant Lizard) is extremely difficult to not make campy but Ifans plays it very seriously and is a very viable enemy. He absolutely brings the comic villain genius to life. Denis Leary is a great addition to as Gwen's father and Police Captain who is also somewhat of a nemesis for Spiderman and Peter Parker. His character adds a certain layer of depth to the story and he plays it very seriously even when he's being sarcastic and angry. It wouldn't even be fathomable for me to mention Martin Sheen and Sally Field, two absolute legends of Hollywood playing Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Sadly they are very underused and only have a few good scenes in the beginning of the film but I wanted to see more of them because of who they are as actors.Part of the issue I had with The Amazing Spiderman was perhaps the lack of emotional depth, the human side that we miss out on. The connection between Peter and his Uncle and Aunt isn't quite felt as well as it should have been. I wasn't moved enough when Uncle Ben was killed. However, this film gets definitively and absolutely better as it goes on. The end of the film is superior to the first part in every way. Its intense, emotional, action packed and jaw dropping. If the entire film was at the quality of the latter half it might have been a ten. The High School Spiderman/Lizard fight is legendary (especially with one of Stan Lee's best cameos), the scenes between Garfield and Leary and the final battle all make this an absolute must see. Marc Webb did an excellent job of creating something that could have and almost should have been a disaster into a viable and watchable franchise. I wanted to complain about how incredibly cheesy and melodramatic the 'crane' scene was during the last scene but darned if it didn't make me get goosebumps and feel all warm and squishy. One thing is for certain, there isn't a Spiderman fan out there that can't say this isn't well done and very entertaining. There is some terrific Spiderman imagery (again especially towards the end.) Let's hope Marc Webb can hold this together throughout the franchise's life. Its greatest feat was to overcome was being far too soon for it to be made and it does overcome that. 8.5/10",8,26,35,3 May 2014
The Lego Movie," Everything is not quite awesome but it was okay
","I suppose it was inevitable I would be waiting for something astronomically mind blowing in animation and fun when it came to The Lego Movie. The hype around this has been unfathomable. Full blown adults told me 'the best movie they've ever seen.' I heard nothing but how hilarious and it was and the cheeky nods to other films so I was eager to watch it. I don't think I was 'hyped' but I certainly had expectations. Now don't get me wrong, The Lego Movie is fun and cute but I had some definitive issues with it and I am completely convinced now that this one of those movies that sort of mass-hypnotizes audiences and everyone sheep life jumps on to the bandwagon. I'm sure I've been guilty of it too but not for this one. I just didn't see the glorious animated feat that everyone else did. I honestly think the film has a distinctive dark, sarcastic undertone and I felt like they were often actually making fun of naivety and the pure quality of childhood toys. It felt a little jaded in that way and maybe that's what adults liked so much about it in some weird way? I guess I like my animation to be cuddly cute with sweet morals and this wasn't it. It has a moral but is it showing it in a sarcastic way? The humour is okay...couple of good chuckles but roll in the aisles? Far from it. I thought the script felt a little generic and nothing really fresh in the idea.The cast is a whose who of Hollywood comedians led by Chris Pratt as our unexpected hero Emmett. Pratt is very good and absolutely captures the right tone for Emmett. If they did one thing right it was creating Emmett to be the focus of the story because he feels like an iconic animated hero. Will Arnett, Elizabeth Banks, Alison Brie, Will Ferrell and Morgan Freeman all stood out for me in their vocal performances of various sizes throughout the film. There are a host of other Hollywood stars doing voices and they all do very good. There are a ton of characters in the movie, this is both a pro and a con for the film. It often feels too packed and because there are so many characters you get flashes of real iconic characters for only a moment and they're hardly used or used poorly (Superman and Green Lantern for instance.) How many ambiguous gay jokes can you pack into a couple of short scenes. The film is a mish-mash of characters that most people absolutely love. I found it just a tad too mish mashed for my liking. Still its very well casted and clear that everyone had a good time doing it. Its also nice to see studios put aside their differences to feature characters from Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, DC Universe, Star Wars and so on.Co-Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have a decent history in animation having worked on Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. You will also notice though that most of their experience is in adult features including their animation having worked on Clone High. So their style of direction would be definitely geared more towards adults. I don't mean to say The Lego Movie isn't appropriate for the young generation because it is!! Its an incredibly fast paced, visual thrill ride but without a ton of substance which is fine. The best scene in the film to me was actually when they leave the animated Lego world and turn to the real human world in order to save their people. Even though I had to see Will Ferrell's face (I'm not a fan) it was easily the best, unique and most well developed turn in the story. Kids will and do love the insanely frantic action and the nods to Lego building (which I honestly was sort of tired of early on in the film.) Its a decent story, a fun movie but I don't really feel like most do that it is some sort of amazing, best film of the year material. As much I despise the gimmick of 3D I would have liked to have seen this in 3D because visually it is a masterpiece!! Unfortunately for me the story lacked development, felt a little dark and jaded and didn't truly floor me the way I expected from others' reaction. However, all this being said I assure you that 'Everything is Awesome' song will be rolling around in your head...for weeks. 6.5/10",6,6,12,19 June 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," A fascinating story punctuated with potentially the two best performances of the year
","Dallas Buyers Club is a fascinating, really well made film. It deserves the solid 9 I am giving it. It was entertaining, educational, based on a true story and the characters are just really captivating. Unlike most films there aren't really any 'heroes' in the movie, these characters are very real and very much victims of circumstance in many ways. The film is a critics dream but they wouldn't be wrong this time because this is a powerful story and the film also gives us not one but two of the best performances of the year and two of the best I have ever seen but we will get to that. I do find it interesting that many of the write ups and implications of our main character Ron Woodroof is that he helped AIDS patients get medication they need. That is true to an extent but he was also (if the movie shows the truth) self-serving. He wouldn't let anyone take the drugs without being paid first. Still he became a hero by circumstance and he makes for one incredibly fascinating larger than life character to watch. I don't necessarily think the film is any great amazing feat of movie making but it is a powerful story and the director owes all the success to an incredible cast.Matthew McConaughey has had a diverse career between mainstream and critics choice type films. He has proved himself again and again in things like A Time To Kill and even this year's Mud. However, this is almost certainly his best performance. Even ignoring the fact that he emaciated himself to look the part, he is mesmerizing as the awful, bigoted and dying Ron Woodroof. He actually manages to make a man who is sort of horrible likable or at least you relate to him. In my opinion out of all the great roles this year, he deserves the Best Actor Oscar period. That's not even to say he's the best performance of the year, nor is he the best in this film. The best performance I have personally seen all year is by the incredible Jared Leto who unequivocally gives the performance of his lifetime. He is unbelievable as a pre-op transsexual. But that isn't even the beginning of the depth of his character Rayon. He's a drug addict, he's been outcast from his family, he is struggling to survive and to find a place in the world. Leto is a huge ten in his performance. He would be supporting actor and if he doesn't get that Oscar...its a complete travesty. The relationship between Woodroof and Rayon is incredible and from the moment they meet, the bond they forge is bizarre and yet so charismatic and heart breaking. Poor Jennifer Garner who is decent in the film is buried in the shadow of these two men in their role. Garner is decent but certainly doesn't stand out. Denis O'Hare, Steve Zahn, Kevin Rankin and Michael O'Neill were also particularly good in their supporting roles of various sizes.This is the only film I have seen from Jean-Marc Vallee and I don't mind to imply he isn't a good director. I just think the actual film making aspect of the movie was good but not amazing. This film is amazing because of the two lead performances that are beyond stunning. They make a 7.5 or maybe an 8 movie into an easy 9. Obviously the film's content is a little heavy and set appropriately in the mid-80's but the time frame doesn't hit you in an obvious way. It simply is when it is and the 80's era doesn't overshadow the point of the film but yet is vital in understanding the fear of the AIDS virus, homosexuality and the life of someone like Rayon. A powerful film that must be seen and I hope gets a lot of attention at least for its stars. It might not be something I'd watch again and again but it was still one of the best movies of the year. 9/10",9,5,8,17 December 2013
The Fast and the Furious," Mainstream fluff but this first instalment works for them
","The first Fast and Furious movie I stumbled into by accident was Tokyo Drift and much to my surprise I loved it. So now because I have heard so much about how great the latest instalment was I have been going back and watching them all. The first film certainly has a strong appeal to it. Car movies are not necessarily my thing, I don't know a lick about cars except how to drive (and my wife would say even that is questionable.) Still the original film in this series also is one of the only ones I have seen outside of Tokyo Drift that is still truly about fast cars and racing. The series eventually evolves into more of a heist/criminal underworld sort of spin but this is truly about the cars. Right off the bat you're dropped into the action and there is some truly excellent action scenes. The characters are not brilliant but they are well defined and interesting despite being very predictable and stereotypical. One thing the Fast Furious series forces down your throats is the idea that this group is a 'family' and will do anything for each other. They start this concept in this movie and then repeat it over and over and over again. A smarter series would let you feel that devotion and friendship with character development. But it is what it is, a simple action flick that entertains.This cast has made their bread and butter with this series. Vin Diesel is a star from this series and a few other roles but mostly this. He fits into it like a round peg into a round hole. He is a good anti-hero and his rough tough as nails charisma works in the movie. Paul Walker also made his name in this series. He is the yin to Diesel's yang. He is softer spoken, the red blooded all American type who is undercover within this gang and becomes one of the family. Walker is a little stiff in his performance and he certainly isn't flexing any major acting muscles but he is a necessity to the story and his chemistry with Diesel works very well. Jordana Brewster is Diesel's sister and Walker's love interest and she does decently. Her character gets very little development but she has a purpose and serves it well. Her chemistry with Walker is solid and their romance is definitely worthwhile. Michelle Rodriguez is Diesel's love interest and I think they actually have great chemistry, very hot on screen but she is very underused in this movie. I was surprised she got such a name from being in this because she is definitely a supporting character and way in the background most of the time. Rick Yune is decent but completely underused and under developed as the 'villain' o sorts. He could have been much better but the character is too weak. Chad Linberg does a terrific job in a very small role and gives one of the stronger performances especially in a supporting role.The film relies entirely on its stunts, fast cars and action scenes. The cast and performances are adequate at best but thanks to a constant stream of adrenaline it ends up being very entertaining. Rob Cohen has a history as a director of relying on adrenaline to make his films. He might be one of the most shallow directors in the way that his movies have very, very little depth. These films, especially this one, is the definition of mindless entertainment. You have to turn off your brain and sit back and enjoy the spectacle. I'm not in any way saying there is anything wrong with that because I was thoroughly entertained. I don't quite understand the massive following this series has but this time I was pleased with the film so what can I say. Be ready to be entertained but not overly impressed. 8/10",8,9,11,8 December 2013
Now You See Me," Now you see me...but I wish I hadn't
","I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here, many of them 'claim' that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However, this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast, some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering 'That's dumb,' 'That doesn't make sense.' They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.The cast certainly is not the issue for this film. The cast is actually pretty good. I'm just surprised they actually signed on to this but then again it is making okay money at the box office. I didn't much care for Jesse Eisenberg's character. That's not to say he didn't do a good job, I just didn't like him much. His character is smug and egotistical but fits the role nicely and carries the cast well. I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent in his role as a mentalist that can hypnotize. He was probably my favourite character and yet there wasn't a lot done with him which is unfortunate. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco I lump together because while they were good they were mostly underused and sort of the sidekicks to Eisenberg and Harrelson most of the time. I think if I was making a film like this I would ensure the four of them share an equal amount of screen time and have strong characters. But they do well. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI agent trying to get to the bottom of the group of thieves. Ruffalo is good, shows lots of intensity and the appropriate amount of angst for cop vs robbers. Unfortunately for her I thought Mélanie Laurent was very near pointless. I suppose she was there to give the audience yet another possible suspect, and also to give Ruffalo a romance but both those angles were completely unnecessary and her monotone line delivery was enough to put you to sleep. Finally, we have two legends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene. However they are definitely blatantly used for their name power and the weak script does nothing for them.Given director Louis Leterrier is a talented director, I'm surprised at really how bad the film was shot. Were there some nicely shot scenes? Yes there was but few and far between. I have actually seen all of Leterrier's films and this was by far the worst of them. I will give props to them in the opening scene when they play a magic trick that actually worked on me...they picked the car that I picked...I wonder if it works on everyone? After that the film falls into a complex web of lies and deceit and completely silly twists and turns that make little to no sense. Perhaps there are two many hands in the pot. There are no less than five screenwriters and story artists on the film. Its hard enough to find two writers that can jive and work together let alone five. Basically, Now You See Me was a huge disappointment for me. In a summer of blockbusters you need something better than this. 4/10",4,57,88,8 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Complex and astounding in many ways
","If nothing else (and this is coming from a die-hard DC fan) Marvel will forever be known for doing their franchises right time and time again. Best of all, they are not afraid of staying strict to their comic roots and making their scripts and characters diverse, fiercely intelligent and complex. I wish more than anything I had sunk myself into the entire X-Men series again before going into this and I absolutely recommend doing exactly that before going into this. I know you don't NEED to but it would help IMMENSELY! Days Of Future Past is a complex web of a story that holds nothing back. Don't get me wrong, it makes perfect sense and it is a sci-fi/action lover's dream. I know my low score (comparatively to others) might make you upset but I assure you I thought this was excellently crafted. I just found myself a tad bit lost in trying to remember everything that came before it. I was certain that director Bryan Singer would complicate this more than it should have been. Most fans agree he dropped the ball with X-Men 3 but I am proud to say he actually used the old cast in the best possible way (minimizing their involvement.) However, where I felt the film stumbled just a little was the lack of characters in it. It certainly focuses on Wolverine, young Magneto and young Charles but the amazing cast from the 'First Class' film are sadly lacking. There really isn't any additional development in the characters and despite a strong action storyline, it falls in character development. Its one and only flaw.I think we've all long agreed Hugh Jackman is and always will be Wolverine/Logan. I can't say much else about him because he becomes the character, he is iconic and amazing in the role. He was the one good thing about the disastrous Wolverine film from last year. However, this time around felt a little lacking for him and it wasn't his usual level of performance in the role. I could say the same for the rest of the cast honestly. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were absolutely astonishing in First Class as younger counterparts to Xavier and Magneto. They were still good in this but it was missing that same level of 'wow' factor. Jennifer Lawrence's Mystique probably got the most development of the cast in this film and yet she still didn't seem to be as great as she was in the original and we know all these actors are fantastic. I think Singer focused so much on the script that he sort of uses the characters as backdrop to the story. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan return in their iconic roles and they are used sparingly but perfectly for the course of the film without getting in the way. Same for the rest of the old cast who are really barely there including Halle Berry and a few tiny cameos from the original X-Men cast. Nicholas Hoult and Ellen Page have important roles but again very small comparatively to First Class. Peter Dinklage was a great addition as our 'villain' of sorts. He did a terrific job but (I'm going to say it again) underused.The heart of this story is the Sentinel program and the time travel aspect in a desperate attempt to stop cataclysmic destruction in the future. The Sentinels were every comic geeks focal point going into this. The build up to finally seeing them for the first time was perfect and they don't disappoint. They are exactly what any fan would want. The other thing Days of Future Past knocks clear out of the park are the special effects...WOW. This was some of the best CGI and special effects I have seen in years. Give them an Oscar right now because nothing comes close. Nothing looks fake or cheap and the scenes are awe inspiring. Singer did some truly outstanding direction here and he should be heralded for it. The one flaw...which I think I've explained enough is that the characters feel just a little underdeveloped and I like my superheroes to be complex characters which X-Men has always done very well. I'm a little surprised the reaction this is getting from fans. Even a friend of mine called it 'the best superhero film ever made.' I can't quite agree with that. It definitely jumps some seriously astounding hurdles but I still don't feel in a lot of ways it matched First Class or even some of the earlier X-Men films. Still a first rate summer blockbuster!! 8.5/10",8,1,3,13 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel continues what they've done and have done well, but for how long?
","Captain America: Civil War was hotly anticipated. I was looking forward to it as well and the film definitely met those expectations. However, I'm feeling the age in the Marvel Universe franchises. The films all seem alike and we already know the cast is great but how many times can you watch any group of actors do the same thing again and again. The shtick for Civil War of course is the heroes fighting each other and the story is solid and the addition of Spiderman is...well forced in there but still fun mostly. The best thing to come of Civil War is that some of the lesser known heroes get their time in the sun. Scarlet Witch becomes a much bigger part of the story, Black Panther (which everyone is raving about) and even Black Widow (give her her own movie already!) The story is good, the pacing is a little slow but the action scenes are as good as they have ever been. Marvel films don't get worse but they set the bar so high that eventually you're going to feel like this is very familiar ground and it is that. It certainly sets up the Universe for the next phase and moving into Avengers. I'm just afraid that this entire genre of films has worn out the superhero world.How much more can you say about this cast? Marvel/Disney casting is and always has been very much dead on. Robert Downey Jr is the master of the Universe as Iron Man and actually has given the role a lot of depth and emotion especially since Iron Man 3. Chris Evans completely embodies Captain America and this film especially gives him a little more edge than usual and seeing him and Iron Man at odds is a nice turn. Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle...these actors absolutely ace their roles but they always have. Not has changed there. Chadwick Boseman who completely enamoured me back in the film 42 (one of the most powerful films I've ever seen) now takes on the role that will likely skyrocket him to Hollywood heavyweight. Black Panther is a fantastic character that will probably be a great stand alone movie and the introduction for him was perfectly fit into this film. Elizabeth Olsen really gets to stand out in this film with a much bigger story arc than previous and she really does well with it. Paul Rudd shows up randomly too as Ant-Man, my least favourite Marvel hero and he completely ruins the scenes he's in. He changes the entire feel of the film and doesn't fit. Tom Holland makes his appearance as Spiderman and I think he'll do a great job however the way they introduced him and threw him into the mix felt very forced. Still he did a good job in the role. Everyone on the cast is at least decent! Captain America: Civil War probably would have made more sense as an Avengers film. It isn't quite focused entirely on Captain America though I see how its his story-line that drives it. The film felt like it was purposely missing Hulk and Thor even though they briefly explain in their absence in a ridiculous forced way. The fact remains if you like the Marvel Universe and you like the films, this is one of the good ones. They've all been good...even the less than great ones and I have high hopes that Civil War will bring this genre into it's golden years. Eventually it has to wind down. It will be interesting to see the Russo brothers who have a long history in Television take on the Avengers films but they also did very well with directing this film as well. 8/10",8,1,6,7 June 2016
Saw III," Saw...rolling out the greatest horror series of the modern era
","I honestly didn't think the Saw series would be able to hold ground past the first sequel. As amazing and terrific as Saw II was, even better than the original, I could see the inevitable prat-falls that would cause the downward spiral of this series. Imagine my shock when they took Saw III and made it even more spectacular, fixed all those plot holes and made the series even more intelligent, more gory, more creepy and gritty and riveting and made us all wet our appetites for more. That makes the Saw series an absolute phenomenon among horror films and horror series. Saw III left behind the premise of a group of people being tortured by the deranged madman Jigsaw and brought back the terror of one person being alone in his game to escape. Each victim is brought together for a reason and a purpose and Jigsaw's heir and student which I thought was a poor addition to the second installment was downright brilliant in the third. The story gets more complex with each turn and it has an intelligent, well based and terrifying plot.Tobin Bell is absolutely brilliant. He is now considered the man who has brought forth one of the most terrifying and brilliantly horrific horror movie monsters of the modern day...Jigsaw or John Kramer as he's known. Bell has been a long time character actor, been on TV for years and years and usually does play the bad guy because he's just got the ominous flavor to his performance but Jigsaw is so versatile. I mean Jigsaw is more than just depraved and completely sick, he's brilliant, a genius even, he believes he has justification for her murders stating constantly how he 'hates murderers.' His soft spoken tone, quiet eyes and disturbing voice makes him absolutely phenomenal for this role. I admit I wasn't a fan of the addition of a Jigsaw sidekick in Saw II but actress Shawnee Smith certainly changed my mind in this third installment. Now granted I think the screen writer did something far more phenomenal with her character making her a victim to Jigsaw as much as anyone despite being his heir apparent. Smith shows a versatility and as deranged as she is there is some pathos felt for her character this time around. She comes across as more of the villain than Jigsaw. We get a far more in depth look into her character arc and how she got to this point with John in flashbacks and moments between each film up until now. Angus Macfadyen plays Jigsaw's latest victim and he will run him through a barrage of tests to teach him forgiveness, each test terrifying and disturbing in it's own right. Macfadyen is brilliant as the tortured father who lost his son in a car accident and now faces the opportunity to exact revenge on those he feels are responsible. Macfadyen makes for a great male lead taking over from Cary Elwes and Donnie Wahlberg. Bahar Soomekh plays Lynn, the brilliant surgeon who is kidnapped by Jigsaw in order to keep him alive long enough to play one last game. Soomekh is very good and a strong female lead and shows an equal amount of strength and sincerity as well as appropriate fear and weakness. Also returning in smaller roles this time around is Donnie Wahlberg and Dina Meyer, the detectives who have tracked Jigsaw since the original and it's sequel.What else can be said?? Saw III is downright brilliant. You can't watch it on it's own right to see it's true brilliance but rather part of one of the greatest horror trilogy's ever made. They are laying down a foundation for what could be an incredible series. Director Darren Lynn Bousman took the helm again after doing the second one and since the two sequels exceeded the original and they seem to be discovering better ways to do things with each one I hope Bousman continues to direct. What more can they do with the series?? I say this after every Saw installment but I can only hope that they manage to continue down the brilliant path they are on. Perhaps we will start to see an unraveling of Jigsaw's history...we saw tiny moments of it in this film but more could be done. So far they have done an incredible job of continuity and bringing everything together. Is Jigsaw gone?? I hope not...I think he's too smart for that. Lord knows I wanna play another game. Incredible film!! 9/10",9,0,1,5 February 2007
Ocean's Eleven," Just a friendly get together...
","I have not seen, but probably will soon, the original Ocean's Eleven but I have no doubt it was made for the same reasons, and with the same intent that this remake was done by Steven Soderbergh. The idea for both is this...get the hottest names, the hottest people in Hollywood, pull them together for a fun, caper movie filled with one liners, killer action, and some great twists and let them have a great time for audiences to see. Ocean's 11 the remake certainly accomplishes this goal full throttle. The stories of the off camera antics of the HUGE Hollywood cast are already legendary. Clooney and Pitt's lavish pranks, as well as the gifts the whole cast exchanged. Throw in the setting of the world's hottest night town and you can't lose. I think that Soderbergh understood this much better than Lewis Milestone who directed the original.Ocean's 11 is about Danny Ocean an ex-con who is released from prison after being sent up for robbery. He wastes no time tracking down his old buddy and hatching the biggest scheme ever in the history of robberies not only to accomplish the biggest score but nail the biggest revenge. Rusty, his partner in crime, agrees that in order to pull this off they are going to need the most elaborate plan the best crew ever to get it done. So they recruit nine of the best of the best, con artists, electronics, brains, thieves, acrobatics...it's the ironic cream of the crop of crime (pulled from the creme of the crop of Hollywood.) Ocean's enemy Terry Benedict is the target as he owns no less than three of the largest Casinos in Vegas.This film's magic is captured within it's purpose as outlined above. It's all about the Hollywood elite getting together for this on screen party. Clooney, Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Bernie Mac, Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia (okay he's not elite but he looks good as the bad guy), Carl Reiner...and some great cameo's from the second string Hollywood Topher Grace, Holly Combs, Joshua Jackson, Wayne Newton, Angie Dickinson (who played Danny Ocean's wife in the original.) They all play themselves in various cameo's throughout. One of the best scenes of the film is when Topher Grace, and Joshua Jackson are leaving the club they are at and they are bombarded by photographers and autograph seekers while Pitt and Clooney walk right by. The film is filled with this little off camera/on camera little tricks and it adds something to the magic.The actual film is actually quite good as well. For a caper movie it's pretty straight forward, nothing new here, but it's definitely pumped up a few notches. It's far more complex and elaborate because it needs to be to pull it off. Their plans basically go off without a single hitch, even when we as the audience think it's a hitch...it's not...it's all part of their plan. It was brilliant writing that puts the audience at the center of their plans without ever revealing what that plan is so we are still surprised and delighted with their clever little plot. Everything is perfectly organized and I don't just mean the plan...the scenery, the cast, the story, the plot, the crime, everything. It's too perfect and that's what this is all about. It's as cool as it possibly could be. And it still holds a certain amount of old time Hollywood charm in there. I could even stand to watch George Clooney as Danny Ocean and he usually drives me insane. The rest of the cast is well fit to their roles although the only one who really seems to have to act would be Matt Damon playing the introverted Linus.I am looking forward to seeing the sequel and even though I am sure it will fall short of this one I can completely understand why the cast would want to try and capture some of what they created in the first one so I will be happy to oblige and watch it. Until then, everyone check this movie out, it's worth it and a good time to be had.8/10",8,0,0,2 January 2005
No Strings Attached," A sort of forced Portman/Kutcher vehicle that is fun but also flat at times
","No Strings Attached looked like it was exactly that. A film that would provide some laughs, good times, but then you mostly leave it behind and forget all about it and that is for the most part exactly what it is. However, given the names on this film I think many go in expecting a lot more especially from Natalie Portman who is definitely rising up as the hottest, best young actresses in Hollywood. For the most part I agree. The film however doesn't provide as many laughs, or gags or Kutcher's trademark physical comedy that he could have done a lot of in the film. The romance is pretty light given it is the focus of the entire film and while both actors are talented, their chemistry wasn't huge and fiery. It wasn't bad chemistry, don't get me wrong, but better chemistry could have pulled the film from mediocrity.Natalie Portman is Emma. Emma is free spirited, strong, a medical residence, a modern day woman. Unfortunately for Portman the character doesn't really go to any depths beyond that. She is cute and lovable and sexy and then that's all they need from her so they leave it at that. The same could be said for Ashton Kutcher who plays struggling writer Adam. The difference is Kutcher manages to put a little more emotion and down to earth charm to his character (something that is really his trademark.) He isn't exactly any different than he is in any other romantic comedy but you do relate to him and find him watchable. The two of them fit together, and certainly make for a hot couple physically. I just wish they had given both of them more to work with character wise. The supporting cast (the typical friends in the relationship) are mostly just romantic film fodder. They are decent and fun but do not stand out in any way even rap star Ludicrous. None of them make themselves significant to the story or film.So is the director a fresh youngster still learning the ropes? Nope. It is legendary director Ivan Reitman. He knows comedy like few others, and also has created and directed some of the most legendary film characters in history. Here is the issue. I firmly believe No Strings Attached is a true Hollywood studio film meaning they had the rights, wanted to slap it together and get it out there to make money. I know often actors and directors etc. are under contract to studios and I think that's why talented Hollywood people end up in fluff that isn't exactly up to their standards. No Strings Attached is not a bad film and if you're a fan of Kutcher or Portman you will likely enjoy it but don't expect it to blow your mind. I think the upcoming complete copy 'Friends With Benefits' starring Justin Timberlake (a proved hilarious comedian) and Mila Kunis looks like they might have taken the concept and star power and put more work into it. No Strings Attached certainly won't leave a lasting impression. 7/10",Null,0,2,12 July 2011
Tropic Thunder," Silly, stupid and yet fits together for a hilarious ride of a bunch of guys having fun and making fun of themselves and their craft
","Why does Tropic Thunder work? Well I think first and foremost it just happens to be blind luck that the chemistry between the actors seems amazing and the wealth of cameos that all seem to just let loose and have a wild and hilarious time certainly helps. The comedy is raunchy, four letter words are everywhere, and the silly slapstick moments are mostly satirical in nature and completely poking fun at movies, their own characters and themselves in a sense and it happens to work out with a very stupid story. In fact the entire story, co-penned by Stiller is very weak. I mean it exists only to vehicle all these crazy characters and moments. It was like the star studded cast got together first, created characters and then built a story around them. It's only fortunate that the cast drives the film and makes it very watchable. I don't like Stiller usually but he is a talented comedian and writer and everything just fits into place. This movie probably has more explosions and gunfire than most summer action blockbusters and yet it was all done in farce.Ben Stiller co-stars as action super star Tugg Speedman who is on the down side of his career. Stiller fits in well and I even think he toned down his over the top comedic performance in order to let the other actors stand out. He is good as Speedman and funny in a more subtle way than his usual characters. Robert Downey Jr. proves his comedic talent as the serious award winning actor Kirk Lazarus who actually changes his skin color to become African American for the war film. Some reviewers are calling his performance racist but they are of course missing the entire point of satire. I won't get into that right now but Downey Jr. gives an awesome performance as the actor trying to be as black as he can be much to the chagrin of his real African American co-star. Brandon T. Jackson plays that co-star, rapper turned actor Alpa Chino...get it? Jackson is terrific and really balances out Downey Jr.'s potentially offensive performance by being a strong black character who always gives him the intelligent answer. Their banter together is classic and proof of how intelligent a satire this actually is. Jack Black plays drug addicted comedian playing serious Jeff Portnoy. His entire performance focuses on completely poking fun at himself and the comedy world in general in Hollywood. His role is dumb, and ridiculous, and insulting to himself and therefore works perfectly in the cast. He is awesome in the role. Jay Baruchel is good as the straight man to the other three's performances. He kind of gets buried in the crazy performances because his is much more subtle. So this is your main cast, now let's talk about the heart and soul of this picture...the cameos which are all fair sized for cameo roles. Matthew McConaughey is terrific as a stunned a little bit sleazy agent to Stiller's character. McConaughey always lights up the big screen and his cameo is no exception. Nick Nolte does a decent job as Four Leaf Tayback, the veteran whose life the film they are making is based on. Nolte kind of flounders in the film and doesn't really find his place amongst the cast and he doesn't really fit into the satire aspect. Tyra Banks, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jason Bateman, Lance Bass, Alicia Silverstone, Mickey Rooney, Kathy Hilton, Tobey Maguire (very funny mock trailer with him and Downey Jr. as gay Priests), and finally we come to the true highlight of Tropic Thunder...Mr. Tom Cruise. I really do love Tom Cruise as an actor. He is powerful and very talented and he proved it hilariously as loud and foul mouth film executive Les Grossman. When he turns on 'Low' and starts gyrating with his bald head and slightly portly belly and loads of body hair I was completely awe struck and laughing hysterically. He was awesome. I would watch this film again just for his role. Also worthy of a mention is newcomer youngster Brandon Soo Hoo who plays the leader of the enemy drug dealers...yes this little boy plays a very ominous and disturbing killer and leader. He is truly awesome and likely has a long career ahead of him. Stiller would be a fool not to cast him again in future films.Tropic Thunder is getting a lot of flack of course, the same flack many films got this summer for inappropriate content in our post 911 world where feelings get hurt when a toe is stubbed. Yes Tropic Thunder is inappropriate...just as much as National Lampoons was back when they were good, or Naked Gun movies, or Airplane, or any other satirical comedies only Tropic Thunder tried to pretend to be serious and not make outright statements. The politically correct crowd wouldn't see this movie anyways and for anyone with a brain if you look hard enough you will find the satire in the film. Yes unfortunately the word 'retard' is tossed around a lot because Stiller offensively portrayed a Handicapped character in a movie that bombed within this movie but when you look at it from a satirical perspective Stiller's character isn't exactly a genius. Most of the main characters in the film are kind asses...so them using that word or Downey Jr.'s character becoming black and then playing it stereotypically is supposed to make you go...wow those guys are ignorant and kind of stupid. Don't get your undies in a bunch until you think about the movie a little...no matter how stupid it is. That being said Tropic Thunder actually turns out to be secretly smarter than it looks and is a good time, with a great cast, all made worthwhile by an incredible performance by Tom Cruise. Check it out for a good time!! 8.5/10",8,2,6,1 September 2008
The Usual Suspects," The character actors ultimate epic...sure to become a classic of cinema
","The Usual Suspects ironically calls itself that and casts itself with some of Hollywood's biggest recognizable character actors. What is a character actor exactly?? Is that truly another word for an actor who doesn't make it as a leading man or woman?? NO. I don't think so at all. A character actor is a very versatile actor who takes on a mix of roles and appears in many, many film after film popping up everywhere. Sometimes they may get a lead role, sometimes not but they don't need to be at the top of the credits to make an appearance and they play important and significant roles and get many more parts than other actors. The Usual Suspects is jammed full of these character actors led of course by the incomparable Kevin Spacey who I must say has become much, much more of a leading man now than a character actor but at the time he was the best at playing these offbeat roles. The Usual Suspects is not exactly a brain science of a film, it doesn't really offer anything incredibly unique to the 'heist' genre of films, it's almost stereotypical and yet it has this feel, it has this quality about it that makes it an unmistakable classic. I expected from what I heard of it that it would be gritty, violent, bloody, horrifying and it is gritty but everything else kind of just fits in with most films but it still has that unmistakable must see quality.Oscar Winner for this role Kevin Spacey plays Roger 'Verbal' Kint, a talkative man with a limp who is known on the street for his elaborate cons. Spacey is brilliant and psychotic and watchable and nearly lovable as Kint. This is one of his best roles and he deserved that Oscar hands down. He does a terrific job in this role. Verbal Kint goes down as a memorable character in film history. Gabriel Byrne, who I've always enjoyed in his roles plays self appointed leader of the Suspects Dean Keaton, a man trying to go clean from his criminal ways. Byrne really doesn't have great range as an actor, most of his roles are very similar but he still has a certain presence on screen and he demands attention and comes across very powerful. Benicio Del Toro plays a smaller yet definitive role as Fred Fenster, a fast talking mumbler that provides the small bit of comic relief to the film. He does well in his quite small part. Stephen Baldwin plays hot headed Michael McManus and I'm surprised this part didn't mainstream him more for big films because he has the star quality and his performance is noteworthy in this film. Kevin Pollak who has done some great work plays Todd Hockney and is kind of back seat to Byrne and Spacey but his performance is also well rounded. Chazz Palminteri does a great job playing 'bad cop' Dave Kujan who spends the entire film interrogating Spacey and their chemistry and banter is very well done. Brilliant character actor Dan Hedaya plays the 'good cop' half as the other cop interrogating him and although he doesn't get a lot of screen time he performs his usual great role. And finally but notably Pete Postlethwaite plays Kobayashi, a liaison between the suspects and big time mythic crime lord Kyzer Soze. He is always a pleasure on screen in small but pertinent roles and I was happy to see him. He has a dark air about him perfect for the part.Bryan Singer is a brilliant director there is no doubt about it. He seems to have a way of bringing out the human in every film. He made the Xmen come to life and more recently created a whole new Superman for a new generation no matter how it was received it had the Singer touch and this is very different for what he has done recently but it still has his stamp of reality on it. The whole story boils down to tracking the mysterious and deadly Kyzer Soze through a crime spree involving assassinating a witness who can identify him. It's an ensemble cast of men without egos and it works so incredibly well from the opening scene and very famous line up to the closing twist of an ending. Now I admit I did kind of figure out the ending so it didn't really come as a shock like it should have, I think they make it far more evident than they needed to but it doesn't diminish the quality of the plot or story. It's an action crime thriller that will most certainly be a classic if it is not already. At best you must watch these to see some truly under-rated actors work brilliantly and to see a dark gritty tale that keeps you entertained until the very last minute. A SOLID 8.5/10!",8,0,1,10 September 2006
Inside Out," At this point, can you ever go wrong with Pixar?
","Make one or two or three good movies and people will say 'Oh I love their movies' or 'Yah I'll give them a shot' but what about if you've made 15 great movies? What about if the majority of those were solid 10/10's? At this point, I wouldn't believe if Pixar couldn't make a great film so I had every expectation of Inside Out being a home-run and it is! Is it my favourite Pixar film? No, not by a long shot but there are parts of this movie that are stone-cold brilliant and some things about it that make it less than outstanding as some of Pixar's previous films. Still, Inside Out is brilliant when it comes to concept. And its also brilliant for the reason Pixar films are and that is the sheer detail that goes into these films. They don't make their animated films with the demographic of children in mind but rather the demographic of everyone. These are films that anyone can watch and like at an equal level. Still, some of there movies tend to be a touch dark and deal with some very intense emotions (pun intended.) They don't shy away from real life lessons and the reality of life (death, marriage, love etc) Inside Out is no exception. There are some heavy duty lessons here and some definitive dark moments so be wary if showing to the real youngsters.Amy Poehler is magnificent as Joy. Her character isn't quite as strong as a lead should be but Poehler captures the character well and her voice isn't as recognizable as you'd think. She definitely makes the character come to life. Phyllis Smith might be the true star of the movie as the adorable and heart wrenching sadness. She gets the character arc and the heroic moment and her and Poehler play off each other perfectly. Smith is literally ideal for the role. Richard Kind is great as Riley's childhood imaginary friend Bing Bong. I don't really think they use him enough actually and his story is definitely heart wrenching as well and has some real morals behind it. Bill Hader, Lewis Black (who else could be anger!?) and Mindy Kaling all perform their roles very well. Each one is perfectly suited to their character/emotional counterpart. Kaitlyn Dias is great as Riley and Mom and Dad are perfectly done by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. One of the best things about this cast is outside of a couple of them like Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black who just naturally fit their roles, you don't recognize some of the bigger stars' voices like Poehler, Hader, Lane and MacLachlan. They sink into their characters and that is a compliment.Inside Out is a completely unique look at the human psyche. The way they turn the brain into a factory like production with these adorable creatures is brilliant. They cover such an insane amount of topics that have to do with memories and emotions that as an adult, it really actually makes you think and really hits home and I think kids will just enjoy the adventure. Pete Doctor (who is a Pixar genius...Toy Story, Monsters' Inc, Wall-E, Up) and Ronnie Del Carmen who might not have the directorial chops but he has worked art direction on several Pixar projects do a really terrific job bringing this world to life. They seamlessly go from the real world to Riley's brain and they even take the time to show some of the other people around her and how their emotions work. Doctor knows how to play to the audience's deep seeded emotions (Up being one of the greatest films ever made period) and he does it again in a slightly lighter way this time around. Inside Out is a must see and while it isn't an instant classic like Up or Wall-E, it still is such a powerfully made, brilliantly visual film with an incredibly unique story that the family can share. 8.5/10",8,10,37,7 November 2015
Die Hard 2," A sequel that had to exist and they absolutely did justice to the original
","I had to really base this review on my true feelings of seeing Die Hard 2. The problem with reviewing Die Hard 2 is if any channel anywhere in Cable land decides to air a Die Hard film...it's this one...I've see Die Hard 2 so many times that it hurts...I always seem to catch the same parts and the same lines on TV over and over again despite the fact that Cable TV attempts to bleep out the language with hilarious voice overs such as 'Yippee Kai eh Mister Falcon---TBS' So I watched Die Hard 2 again beginning to end for this review and I must say the film truly is great in it's own right. I mean plugged up against the magnificence of the Die Hard original...it pales in the shadow but nonetheless has some really important features that make it a necessary and worthy sequel to greatness. Director Renny Harlin took over from the unmatchable greatness of John McTiernan and Harlin was the perfect pick because his career and films, much like McTiernan has had greatness and not so great. Harlin seemed to know the characters and story and what was necessary to create the brilliance of another Die Hard film. Still there was a different and distinctive style in Harlin's film over the original. The sarcasm and biting humor was toned down a great deal and the supporting cast wasn't nearly as important as John McClane and the terrorists but setting the film in an airport was sheer brilliance. The most important thing was not lacking and that was unstoppable, kick ass, edge of your seat, things blowing up ACTION!! Bruce Willis returned to his familiar role as tough, rugged, ripped good guy cop John McClane waiting for his now reconciled wife Holly to land in Washington and join him and their kids at her parents home. John with instincts in tact smells something funny going down and everything from there on in is typical Die Hard. Bruce Willis is still amazing in this role and although I don't think the second installment had near the bite and brawn of John McClane that the original had he's still amazing at it and a true action hero further implementing that modern day action cowboy name. Bonnie Bedelia also returns as McClane's once estranged wife that pulled him into the first terrorist plot. Much the same as last time Holly is at the whim of terrorists only this time she is in a jet circling the airport the terrorists have taken control of. Bedelia still has that very strong female role down pat and she suits the idea of a woman who can handle McClane. She also has the pleasure of verbally torturing slimy News anchor Richard Thornburg who happens on the same plane as her played by William Atherton also returning from the original. He gets more of a substantial role and is even more slimy and the perfect adversary for Holly who makes short work of him. William Sadler is terrific as the lead terrorist Col. Stuart although he still doesn't hold a candle to previous lead terrorist in Die Hard played by Alan Rickman but he does a decent job as a man determined to achieve his goal. He's military, decisive, violent, and determined like any great terrorist in films. Franco Nero is also good as the major drug dealer the terrorists are negotiating to have released and escape. Add in the cameo and supporting roles by Reginald VelJohnson, John Amos, Dennis Franz, and Art Evans as McClane's newest sidekick and you've got a great cast.Most importantly the action is swinging within ten minutes of the film's beginning. A gunfight in the baggage claim, suddenly terrorists have control of the flight towers, then they are crashing a 747 filled with people yards from John McClane who is dropping to his knees in terror, a snowmobile chase across an icy lake with machine guns blazing, a high speed Jet chase and finally an unbelievable explosion that is still one of the great explosion scenes in film history. Die Hard 2 lives up to it's name sake and certainly does not disappoint in any fashion. It might not have quite the same wallop that the original had but it also doesn't take away from the series but whole heartedly adds a new chapter that is more than welcome. If you haven't see Die Hard...or Die Hard 2...you don't even know what an action film is. 8.5/10",8,0,2,24 March 2007
Yesterday," Cute and fun, it strives to bring something different to summer
","I loved the concept of Yesterday and was excited to see it. It doesn't disappoint and it presents exactly what you would anticipate from the movie. The music is wonderful, the cast is very good, the romance is awesome, it has some good laughs and some genuine heart. And yet somehow it stops short of being great. The film is good but for some reason forgettable. It never really seems to find it's own magic and that's unfortunate because the concept is very neat and watching Jack's rise to fame. I understood Kate McKinnon's role as the power hungry manager but her performance of it made it slapstick comedy which didn't fit in the walls of this bittersweet-indie-romance-comedy. She felt out of place and almost annoying which is her vibe in a lot of things to be honest. Himesh Patel and Lily James are magnificent though. They are perfect in the movie and their chemistry is excellent. It actually is the backbone of the movie rather than the songs or the concept but actually the romance that goes on between them. Certainly if you're looking for something different or a nice date movie, this is worth checking out because it's nice. It won't floor you but it's nice and nice is okay. 7/10",7,0,1,8 July 2019
Resident Evil," Shoot-em-up smash at the movies!!
","Ultimately I had no expectations of this movie. Although the advertisements did catch my attention and I was a huge fan of the original game...I didn't expect greatness or failure from the movie. Originally when they talked George Romero or Sam Raimi as director and the possibility of stars such as Kiefer Sutherland or Bruce Willis starring I will admit I did form some sort of image as to what I thought Resident Evil should. This movie did not come close to what I had in my head...but it didn't matter...I still consider it amazing. The action was top notch and the music was pounding and excellent. It was futuristic (moreso than one would imagine) and the whole story comes together in such a way that you are left very, very satisfied. The characters and actors are excellent and you are definitely left disappointed to see any one of them killed. I would like to have seen more of them survive. Milla Jovovich comes through in a big way as the kick-butt heroine who gets some great dialogue. This movie felt like X-Men in the way that it left you wanting more and it felt like it was only the beginning. I thought the ending to Resident Evil was phenomenal and perfect and I couldn't have wished for a better ending. I hope that Hollywood carries on the grand tradition of milking sequels because I would keep coming back for as many instalments of Resident Evil as they can churn out.",9,2,3,11 April 2002
Avengers: Endgame," Definitely an epic finale unlike anything else
","Marvel has been up and down for me over the last decade. The superhero genre is definitely wearing thin and then comes this juggernaut of film which is breaking all records and likely to become the biggest film in history. The ratings and reviews have been all around great but I still had reasonable expectations. For the most part, Avengers Endgame fulfilled every expectation I had for it. It has a massive runtime and doesn't actually feel slow at all. The three hours goes by easily and the film builds expertly on it's previous films. There has never been an ensemble cast like these movies and this film specifically. There was a significant character development change with Hulk/Bruce Banner and also Thor and I'm not sure I liked either one. Hulk wasn't really Hulk but then it also made a lot of room for new development. Thor's change was sort of unnecessary and fans of Thor would be quite annoyed at his change I would think. Captain America and Iron Man though are as solid as they've ever been. Robert Downey Jr gives one of his best performances as Iron Man that he's ever given (no it's not Oscar worthy - sorry fans!) . The first 2 + hours of the film are not action packed. It takes it's time building the story and visiting previous points in time throughout the Avengers history and then comes the final battle. Now the final battle of this film is the definition of blockbuster. It is massive in scale and incredible to watch and edge of your seat, popcorn thrills. You can't help but want to cheer when the entire Marvel Universe shows up and Captain America utters 'Avengers Assemble' (for the first time) before one of the largest battles I've ever seen. The last 30-45 mins of the film is a solid 10 in spectacle. Avengers Endgame is fulfilling a lot of expectations and for me it was a good time at the movies and a worthy end to this particular leg of one of the most successful franchises in film history. 8.5/10",8,2,9,7 May 2019
Dirty Dancing," An absolute classic with this magic aura around it making it unmissable
","Dirty Dancing is one of my favorite movies of all time...I'm not afraid to admit it, watch it, LOVE IT...and I'm straight!! Dirty Dancing is one of the fastest growing classics of all time now twenty years after it's original release. It seems like almost everyone has seen it, quoted it, talked about it, know of it...it's quite simply magical. The film isn't really BRILLIANT, it's not breath taking in the traditional sense of the word, it's not feat of acting or story so what exactly makes it so incredible?? Magic. Chemistry. The sexiest movie of all time without even a hint of nudity, extreme language, or gratuitous sex. It's just like being dropped into your own summer of love so to speak. It's a coming of age story, a moralistic lesson in standing up, speaking your mind, and helping others against all costs and all the while learning about yourself and becoming an adult. It's simple to see that writer and co-producer Eleanor Bergstein passionately wrote on her own experiences and has a very passionate and romantic mind set when she writes. The characters are almost very shallow and yet you become completely entangled in their lives and you won't ever forget Baby and Johnny Castle.Jennifer Grey headlines the cast as seventeen year old Frances 'Baby' Houseman. Grey is beautiful and sexy but in this very withdrawn, quiet way. It's not overwhelming beauty or screen presence but something very subtle about her. (Grey was actually 27 when she portrayed this role.) This will be (somewhat unfortunately) Grey's greatest role that she will forever be immortalized for. And then Mr. Patrick Swayze. I am a huge Swayze fan and will forever be waiting for his come back to the big screen. He is multi-talented and a great presence and has had some great roles but I'm not sure any compare to the macho, steaming hot, rhythm dancer Johnny Castle. Swayze is just the exact definition of macho but a dancer which seems like an oxy-moron but it's not because he made dancing macho!! He looks incredible doing it, the man is a master on his feet and in the same breath can knock scum bag waiter Robby's block off. Swayze was brilliant. They could not have cast a better actor for this part. The two of them together is really the point of magic. Grey and Swayze are just jaw dropping in this love hate, intense passionate incredibly sexy affair that they have. When they dance together you just can't take your eyes off of them. The supporting cast are almost as important as the main cast because there is just something so incredible about this cast. First of all the late Jerry Orbach is really something as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father. He really has a great role and is a significant player in the film. Cynthia Rhodes shines as dancer Penny Johnson who finds herself pregnant and alone and scared with only Johnny to turn to. Jack Weston as the caring but firm owner of the Kellerman's hideaway that they stay at is terrific, and Jane Brucker as the older sister of Baby far more concerned with menial things like her appearance and personality and her relationship with Robby the waiter. Max Cantor is downright slimy as the womanizer Robby who gets Penny in trouble and then moves on to Lisa Houseman. These are just a few of the really stand out supporting roles in Dirty Dancing.You just simply won't find choreography that stuns like Dirty Dancing whether it's the crazy kids alone in their compound Dirty Dancing or whether it's Baby and Johnny on stage, or the final scene dancing at Kellerman's...even if you're not a fan of dancing you can't help but stare in awe. Then you have the romance and the music...I could write an entire review on the music. Dirty Dancing has some of the best musical montages in history including my personal all time favorite and one of my all time favorite moments in movie history, the 'Hungry Eyes' sang by Eric Carmen montage where Baby learns to dance. I could watch that scene over and over and over again. Dirty Dancing is a hard film to explain because there isn't anything else like it. They've tried to repeat the success with a short lived TV Series (which I would kill to see) and a sequel: Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights which was average in every sense of the word. The only thing that can be said is that there was a magic where everything fell into place...the cast, the music, the setting, the story, the famous lines: 'I carried a Watermelon?' 'Nobody puts baby in a corner.' '...most of all I'm afraid of walking out of here and never feeling again the way I feel when I'm with you.' If you haven't seen this film...you're downright crazy because it's brilliant and an instant classic forever in my top 5 of all time. 10/10",10,0,0,1 July 2007
Quantum of Solace," Continues Craig's reign as Bond...but still not quite the quality of Casino Royale
","As much as I love sequels it is a rare thing to have the second installment as good or better than the original. This is probably part of the problem with Quantum of Solace besides its questionable title. This is the first time a film has been a direct sequel to a previous Bond title. Quantum of Solace is like an exact continuation of Casino Royale which was a masterpiece in reinventing Bond. There is nothing wrong with that but it means there is a lack of an original story, repeat characters, and rehashing some of the original concept. All that being said Quantum of Solace has some truly incredible action moments, some amazing battles, but lacked the depth of plot that Casino Royale had. The film jumps right into incredible action and picks up exactly where Casino Royale leaves off. I made sure I watched Casino Royale literally hours before going into Quantum of Solace and I do think it enhanced how much I enjoyed it because it could succeed in being one big film. If you loved Craig's turn as Bond then you won't be disappointed because he does return in a big way although I will say what I said after Casino Royale...he is not your Grandpappy's Bond. They have reinvented him with an edge and a much darker side.Daniel Craig has the perfect balance of suave smooth character with that tough as nails, license to kill psychotic side to him that they seem to be giving to the new era of Bond. He is still a kick ass hero and really holds his own on screen. I don't think he gets nearly the depth of character in Quantum of Solace but he is still really great to watch. Olga Kurylenko is the sultry new Bond girl and fits the bill to a T. She fills all the previous shoes just perfectly and her and Bond have a sexy passionate and chemistry ridden relationship. She is terrific and should have a promising career ahead of her. Mathieu Amalric could have been a really great villain. Here is the issue...it seems like they downplayed him as a villain and he doesn't really get the full treatment of being a Bond villain like they did previously. He is almost forgettable as a villain and yet has this really great look and style to him. Judi Dench and Jeffrey Wright return as their cameo roles that suit them very well although Wright is hardly used in this film.Director Marc Forster takes over direction and does a good solid job. Forster has done some really terrific films and he has a good handling on style and action. Many IMDb reviewers have said how dark this Bond film is and how he goes over the edge but it seems like they are over analyzing the film because while the plot is that Bond is on a revenge kick I don't think he goes over the edge and that there is this truly dark kick to the Bond story. Craig's Bond has had edge since the minute Casino Royale started and that hasn't changed. The whole plot which it seems they had to force the title into making sense is a little much and with all the action in the film it would have made more sense to be about weapons, or computers or something other than water...which is the basis of the film. Still Bond fans can rejoice because the franchise is in tact and still terrific with Craig making us proud. 8/10",8,3,10,15 January 2009
Gone with the Wind," Everything you think it would be and more!! Gone With The Wind lives up to it's powerful reputation
","I waited 28 year before even considering watching Gone With The Wind. Four plus hours long? 1939? It was as old as my Dad. But finally in a desire to see all these classic movies I sat down to watch it...since then and before writing this review I have now seen it three times. Gone With The Wind is quite simply breath taking. It is brilliant and captivating and perhaps one of the greatest epics you will ever lay eyes on. Some people consider Gone With The Wind to be the greatest film ever made and it's pretty easy to see why. Especially if you factor in the time period this was made the 'special effects' the sheer grandeur of it is impressive NOW let alone 65 years ago. The raging war, the fields being worked, the attacks being carried out, the people evacuating, and the beauty and horror of the south during the civil war. Add onto that this incredible unmatched chemistry between the romantic leads and you've got one incredible epic that defined epic before it even existed.Vivien Leigh is Scarlett O'Hara. One of the most influential and recognizable characters in movie history...probably top 3. Leigh's Scarlett will remain in your memory forever. Her character goes through so many changes and at times you literally despise her...she's whiny and needy and mousy and then in the next breath you see this incredible strength and wisdom and this ability to make her such a hero. She's a strong female lead and her performance is amazing. Scarlett O'Hara is one of the greatest characters in movie history. Clark Gable as the irrepressible Captain Rhett Butler. At first I thought Gable's performance lacked depth. I thought he came across as a movie star there to show off his stuff but then as the film progressed I began to see what Captain Butler was all about. Rhett Butler had this air of over-confidence, a macho party man with nothing holding him down including political ties. His reputation as a drunkard and a rich bachelor suited him fine. Then Scarlett comes into his life and he falls hopelessly in love with the most unlikely girl that plagues him for the years and years. Gable is a master and looks incredible on screen and shows why men of his era were leading men the likes of which we've never known. He definitely deserved his Oscar Nomination for the role. The supporting cast is so huge I could go into detail on every single one of them. They all do an incredible job including the first African American actor to be nominated for an Academy Award Hattie McDaniel who is just wonderful as 'Mammy' their beloved house servant. Leslie Howard as Scarlett's love interest for years and years Ashley Wilkes. Olivia de Havilland was one of my favorite supporting roles as the loving and kind Melanie Wilkes (who marries Ashley away from Scarlett.) She was terrific in her role, one of the best characters in the film. Harry Davenport, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil, Butterfly McQueen...so so so many other terrific performances in this film. Also watch for uncredited and small roles by future stars George Reeves (Superman), and Richard Farnsworth (The Straight Story/Anne of Green Gables.) For years I haven't been a fan of old classics. Just now am I getting around to watching them but if you're the same way put that aside and see Gone With The Wind. It's LONG, there is no doubt about it but it's utter brilliance, story, action, romance, and just everything about it will keep you absolutely riveted. I now completely understand why people consider this one of the greatest films ever made if not THEE greatest. I don't know if I can say that exactly because I have my own list of favorites for different reasons but I will say Gone With The Wind is perhaps the exact definition of a classic and worthwhile from beginning to end. One of the greatest films I have ever seen and I will be sure to add this to the list of movies I watch again and again. 10/10",10,18,28,8 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," Over-analyzed and over appreciated, it starts out being one thing and then goes off into another world
","People who watch these critical darlings really amuse me. They use words like 'hauntingly flawed' or 'beautiful and haunting' or 'stayed with me for days.' No Country For Old Men, at least the first hour and a half is main stream, well done, captivating, gory drama, thriller, action western and then the last half hour takes the film into this queer, nonsensical, blathering of artistic garbage that only someone who pretends to understand would care about. I do understand where they are trying to go with the film...the moral is...times have changed. Was that so hard to say? Instead they create an entire character, use a first class actor to portray him who does little to nothing in the entire film because artistically he's 'washed up and tired of the world.' It doesn't come across like that at all. The infamous Coen Brothers drop this interesting thriller/drama on you with this in depth creation of a serial killer who is just completely hell bent and disturbing and then they toss the entire story away on a disgustingly stupid and boring ending never giving closure to anything that they set up prior. I almost wonder if they did it on purpose as some sort of a cruel joke. I mean it feels like they got to a certain point in the film where they should have ended it but decided, 'no let's tack another 45 minutes on it but just ram whatever we come up with on to it.' As one IMDb reviewer pointed out...it feels tacked on and like a completely different movie. Josh Brolin is really terrific as country man Llewelyn Moss. As we quickly discover Moss is not as country and as stupid as he might come across. In fact he's quick witted, honest, and a fast study. He turns out to be a formidable opponent to a killer who has never had a formidable opponent. Brolin is terrific in the role. A worthy hero whose character is demeaned by its ending. Javier Bardem...well if anyone actually deserves Oscar nomination for this film it might be him. Bardem plays steely cold, brutal and ruthless killer for hire and for fun Anton Chigurh. He is a strange and interesting character who we learn and know little to nothing about. He seems to like games, and he seems to be brilliant and subversive. His straight expressions and monotoned voice make him downright disturbing. The wasted actor on the pointless character I mentioned is the amazing Tommy Lee Jones who doesn't get to be very amazing as the tired, worn out old Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Jones is a phenomenal actor but he's almost useless in this role. He stumbles around a crime scene or two intelligently pointing out facts and then spewing wisdom about how things have changed and then doing nothing else. Very unfortunate.When it comes down to the very clever cat and mouse game between Brolin and Bardem, the film is brilliant. Bloody, and riveting and the story is starting to unfold but everything goes by the wayside. The key here is that so much of the story is unknown to us. An entire bloody battle over drugs has transpired and we know little to nothing about it. We only know this insane serial killer enters the picture and wants the money found and kept by Brolin's character.*******SPOILERALERT**********This is one time I can't help but spoil the film because I need to rant about it. The film goes down hill when, outside of the viewers sight, they cheaply kill off the main character of Llewelyn Moss, by Mexicans who also want the money. We don't see the kill...there is never any show down of any kind between Brolin's Moss and Bardem's Chigurh, and after that death the film literally just goes to pieces. However, outside of the horribly misplaced and mis-made ending, No Country For Old Men will likely impress you. It is shot in such a style that it feels like an old Western...the long, single shots and the gritty sand swept desert. Still fatal flaws make this one a poor choice by the Academy. 7/10",7,12,21,10 February 2008
The Love Guru," Precisely as juvenile and ridiculous as you'd expect and yet somehow I did laugh...a lot
","I think by now anyone who sees a Mike Myers film can expect the same recipe that has made him billions, the Austin Powers recipe. How can you hate on The Love Guru when it is exactly everything that the Austin Powers films were? For all the terrible reviews and constant heckling about the content of this film after all was said and done I actually thought it wasn't half bad. Ridiculous? You better believe it. Childish? Completely. Making you laugh when you feel guilty about laughing at such stupidity? That's called Mike Myers. Some compare this film to the earlier Adam Sandler film You Don't Mess With The Zohan (see my review) and yet I can say in all honesty I thought The Love Guru was far more entertaining than Zohan in many ways. Maybe it's simply that Mike Myers can pull of childish humor better than any man...or comedian alive and that's what seems to make him tick. I'm not encouraging anyone to rush out and see this and I'm not telling you it's any great feat of film making by any means and it shouldn't be compared to anything really currently in theaters. All I am saying is for the expectations I had and for stupid humor it was watchable and even humorous at times.Mike Myers is remarkably only one character...Guru Pitka, a white man who was raised in the traditions of Eastern religion and is now the world's second leading Guru (behind Deepak Chopra--a running gag in the film.) Myers is silly and funny and damn it he's having a good time and that's what makes this film insatiably watchable despite your better judgment. His character, like so many others he has created, is somehow lovable and fun to watch. His acting stinks but clearly he's doing an elongated skit and it's like the friend you have who always does stupid voices and makes you laugh. Jessica Alba sticks out like a hot sore thumb in this film. The last person you'd expect to see in this as a major leading character and somehow a romantic interest for Myers is Jessica Alba. She does alright although her strong suit is really standing there and looking hot and saying a few lines and she is really good at that. Romany Malco is decent enough as a troubled hockey player and the straight man to Myers jokes. Verne Troyer (yes Mini Me) plays the Maple Leafs coach and probably gives one of the best actual acting performances in the entire film. He's funny in an angry kind of way and just really does a great job. Finally the star of the show the entire reason to see this film...Justin Timberlake. I knew after he hosted Saturday Night Live this guy had comedic talent and he just blows you away as the well endowed Celine Dion obsessed French Canadian goalie for the Kings. He is hilarious and he is having a great time too clearly. It's not a role that requires anything but to have a good time and act like a goof and his is awesome. He outshines even Myers with his comedy. Also check out a substantial comedic cameo by none other than Sir Ben Kingsley as the cross eyed Guru Tugginmypudha. Also the film is chock full of Hollywood cameos including Deepak Chopra, Jessica Simpson, Kanye West, Rob Blake, Val Kilmer and a funny little cameo by Law and Order's Mariska Hargitay.The movie is not a good movie case closed and it doesn't try to be. It's like going to a wild party for an hour and a half and I left and I actually felt good, still laughing at how stupid some of it was and yet isn't that exactly what they were trying to do? The sheer idea of Buddhists or any religion being upset about this film is ludicrous. It never once tries to take itself seriously or even take jabs at Indian culture. I've seen comedies and dramas that are far more ignorant to religions and cultures than this could ever be because it's like they are standing up and saying...this is not serious now have fun!! Toilet humor abounds, stupid jokes, eye rolling humor and yet somehow it's just fun. So if you think you might enjoy something like this then take this over Zohan any day because it's the dumbest thing in the theaters but you won't feel like you wasted your time or money. I'd even probably sit through it again for Justin Timberlake alone. This is director Marco Schnabel's debut and I think he probably just let Mike Myers have his way but this is what you should expect. 6/10",6,5,12,6 July 2008
District 9," Stunning...one of the most brilliant sci-fi films ever. It will be under rated!!
","I think the latter part of 2009 will almost certainly show some really interesting science fiction films including my highly anticipated Surrogates (drooling for this release.) District 9 looked interesting and in the little I had seen on it I had the wrong impression entirely of the plot of the movie. I thought District 9 was about Aliens landing in the future and basically imprisoning human beings. This was completely not even close to the plot. Aliens crash land against their wishes on earth in an alternate time line earth in the eighties. The humans usher the Aliens into a small ghetto type area where essentially their social climate erupts into crime and disease. There is without a doubt some social message here but all of that aside the movie is downright brilliant. Full of action, and drama, and emotion and humor the movie is a nonstop thrill ride. Made on a relatively low budget of thirty million the special effects are spot and brilliantly done. While there aren't a lot of so called 'battle scenes' the ones that are there are just eye dropping and brilliant. The story, the direction, the action and every other part of the film just falls into place to create one of the most entertaining movies of the summer and it has heart and intelligence to boot.Sharlton Copley is apparently a newcomer to the big screen, this being his only acting credit. That only makes his performance as by the book alien relations office all the more impressive. His character goes through incredible changes physically and emotionally and his performance is mind blowing. Some IMDb reviews call it Oscar worthy and while that is probably very true it would never happen given the mainstream quality of District 9. Still he has an incredibly fascinating character and is just simply incredible to watch. On top of that he is basically a one man show when it comes to this film. Yes there are supporting characters but they are very small roles all around and the only other characters that have any substantial screen time are the aliens themselves. I'm sure the lack of actual actors in the film made the budget restraints better for the special effects.Director and writer Neill Blomkamp is fairly new to the big screen as well but clearly if you look back to his live action Halo shorts you will see the man is potentially a visionary director and loves science fiction and that will most certain bode well in the future if he is kept on to director the 'Halo' film. District 9 is entirely his baby and he is brilliant. The world he creates is so incredibly realistic and the documentary style shooting is not overused like it has been in the past with films like Cloverfield or Quarantine. He uses it rather to immerse you into the story and then doesn't hesitate to return to a more stylish and normal film style. He gives the Aliens personality, and heart and emotion whether it be anger or sadness, hatred or love and the one thing you will be left wishing for is more on the intriguing character of Christopher Johnson (the Alien father trying to do nothing more than save his son.) District 9 begs for another installment and yet no one should touching this except Neill Blomkamp because this is entirely his creation. Science fiction fans, action, horror fans you must absolutely see this film...it will be under rated most certainly and yet is probably one of the best films of 2009 hands down. Absolutely breath taking!! 10/10",10,4,9,4 September 2009
Mamma Mia!," Silly and cute without a lot of emotion but its fun!!
","I really do love a great musical but I'm ashamed to say I've never seen Mama Mia on stage but I certainly would! However with amazing musicals in the past few years on the big screen like Rent, and Hairspray I really wanted to see Mama Mia. I especially enjoyed the idea that the cast were great actors but not necessarily who you might see singing on stage. The music is always classic and I had heard nothing but rave reviews for the musical so thought this would be a blast. When all is said and done Mama Mia is the most fun you'll have at a musical this year. It has the spunk and spirit of Hairspray (which was brilliant), a breath taking beautiful setting, Hollywood stars, an amazing 70's pop soundtrack that everyone can sing along too and it just looks like the cast is having a great time. The story (while just a whole lot of fun) isn't really deep. It doesn't tackle any political, social or hidden agenda, it's just feel good and fun and it has to be taken as just that. I think given Mama Mia's appeal on stage that the movie was almost certain to be a hit and its likely one of the most well known musicals of the modern age.I always felt that Meryl Streep was one of the most over rated actors in history. Slowly my opinions on her are changing since I've seen her in Devil Wears Prada, Doubt and now this. She is incredibly versatile and she definitely has a screen presence to be reckoned with. That is exactly what she flaunts in Mama Mia. She isn't a brilliant singer (although she is pretty good) but she is terrific as the high spirited mother of the bride. Amanda Seyfried steals the show as determined engaged Sophie. She is brilliant and lovely and really just fun to watch and her and Streep have terrific mother daughter chemistry. Stellan Skarsgård, Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth are just terrific as the three potential fathers. None of them really strike you as musical leading men which makes them perfect. They all have distinct personalities and you will find your favorite but they are terrific. Together they are electric and the chemistry is awesome. Three Hollywood hunks that will keep you riveted in the quest for Sophie's real Dad. Honorable mention to the amazing Christine Baranski who has a small role but adds to the fun in a big way.Romance, laughter, heart break and just a riot will make you feel like you are a part of the wedding and a part of the family. It doesn't exactly move you like some musicals I have seen but it is simply fun. I think perhaps the film makers might have been taking a risk giving the helm of the film to Phyllida Lloyd mostly because she has had little experience on the big screen. However, apparently she knows musical theater like none other and with a film of this type that's all that matters because although I have never seen the stage version, Mama Mia translates to the big screen brilliantly. What can I really say about the music? Its the Bee Gees with some of the most beloved music that the film fits into perfectly. I think its sheer brilliance that the play was written to the music and not the other way around. Mama Mia might not change the face of musicals but it is well worth seeing again and again and is certain to be a classic!! 8.5/10",8,0,1,6 December 2009
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," I'm not sure I get it....so meh to this instalment
","I'm a fickle Lord of The Rings fan. When I saw the original trilogy in theatres I found them long and boring and didn't really get what everyone was excited about. When I re-watched them later on, I began to understand and see this incredible world that Peter Jackson had created and the painstaking process of bringing the story and characters to life. So I was a changed man. Then came the first Hobbit and because I had become a fan of the series I really enjoyed it. I know it wasn't as good as the original trilogy and as many reviewers have said it felt like they focused on the spectacle and special effects and light on the story. It felt more like a video game at times but thank goodness Jackson still keeps his world in tact. So now comes Desolation of Smaug and I had heard that it was even better than the first so I had decent expectations. Desolation of Smaug (for me) was a further example of how they can show off their CGI skills and still not develop much of any characters or plot. Honestly, I found myself asking several times through this film...what exactly is going on? Why are they still walking and what is the point of all this? It doesn't seem that complex and yet I don't even understand why Bilbo is there. There are truly astonishing visuals in the film and once Smaug is revealed it definitely ups the ante and despite the fact that I'm annoyed he is nothing more than an animated dragon on a computer...the end scenes were the best.The original trilogy created characters that won't ever be forgotten. The cast was beyond first rate. The cast for the Hobbit is okay at best. The characters aren't focused on at all and they are literally just there. The exception is Richard Armitage who came into the film as our hero Thorin Oakenshield. Armitage is good but he lacks the same chemistry that Viggo Mortensen had in the original trilogy. Still he plays his role well. Martin Freeman is the exception to all of this because he is an amazing character and perfect for his role. While I didn't think Bilbo was nearly as effective in this part as the first, he still is very good. The rest of the Dwarfs are all good and they play their roles well but they literally have no independent character. At least in the first one it felt like you could tell who was who but in this one, its barely noticeable. I was very excited that Orlando Bloom was returning to the series as Legolas but he didn't really seem like he had his heart in it. He had some great action scenes but once again...lacked depth. Evangeline Lilly joins the cast as Tauriel. She is a good character and the chemistry between her and Legolas is interesting. Ian McKellen's role is severely reduced in this film and I think that was a huge strike against it as well. McKellen's Gandalf is and always has been a huge part of this series and he is stunning in it so to have him missing hurt the film a great deal.Peter Jackson has set a bar for himself and this series that is astronomically high. Its too easy to sit back and pick apart all the negative things about this. The fact is, if you love this world that Jackson has created then returning to it will be terrific for you. The film is visually magnificent and Jackson builds two films towards revealing this magnificent dragon (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch who does a great job) and while I do hate CGI I understand why it is used and for the most part it is used extremely well. The flaw to the film is the lack of character development. Jackson forgot that he may have already established this world but these are new main characters that we have to get to know and fall in love with and he fails to deliver that for most of them. I am still anxious to see the final film with the expectation that this may be the last time we experience this world created by Jackson and helmed by him too. Regardless, this is the quintessential fantasy epic. 7/10",7,0,4,11 January 2015
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A dark, bleak, gritty biography that some how captivates and pulls you in
","I wasn't sure what to make of The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford when I was first watching it. Was it nothing more than a Brad Pitt vehicle looking to score some artistic points? It had this ominous narration that felt like an elongated episode of A&E's Biography. And as it continued all the pieces began to fall into place and I was pulled into this dark, paranoid, gritty, dust ridden world of Jesse James and his descent into his own destruction. I'm not one to call out the artistic greats of a film unless it entertains as well and I'm not sure that this film would appeal to everyone certainly but I'm an enormous history fan, and love Westerns and this one just felt real from beginning to end and the actors in the film really knocked this one out of the park with some really powerful performances. They are very subtle and it really starts to sink in on you about half way through. You feel like you're being drawn into everything that they are and you wait and wait for the moment you know is coming right from the minute you see the title of the film. And when it happens...it doesn't disappoint. The Assassination is shocking and violent and so sudden that you will reel back and...if you're a little morose like me...watch it again...in slow motion...because it's brilliantly done. Everything in the film is so subtle right up to the Assassination and then you're just rocked.Brad Pitt is Jesse James and gives one of the more subtle performances. I like Pitt, he's an amazing Hollywood star but he also has some incredible talent proved in such amazing roles as 12 Monkeys, Meet Joe Black, and the amazing Se7en. This role is so quiet at first and you can't believe that this family man is the cold blooded killer but that is the whole idea. No one had any idea and throughout the film he has a descent into almost complete madness. This film takes the liberty that he set up his own death ultimately not being able to live with himself and his paranoia. Pitt is excellent. I really wasn't sure about the Oscar nominated performance of Casey Affleck who plays the coward himself Robert Ford but once again he really grew on me. Ford has all these very distinct personality traits and almost tics as he lives and idolizes Jesse but essentially trades his passion for glory as they say. He'll do anything for number one which is him. You go through so many emotions with his character...you despise him, pity him, relish him, hate him, and feel his own self loathing. It really is quite the performance and Pitt and Affleck play off each other brilliantly. Paul Schneider is a deliciously slimy character Dick Liddil. He's just a real scum bag and you love to hate him all the way through. Sam Rockwell is good as the nervous brother to Affleck's Ford. His character has a lot of emotional moments in the film and he does well. Jeremy Renner is also good as rough around the edges cowboy and Jesse's cousin. And Mary-Louise Parker has a small role as Jesse's wife but it's a good role although she's barely recognizable in it. One of the truly terrific roles in the film is that of the Narrator Hugh Ross who has an amazing voice and it really did make an impact having him narrate certain aspects of Jesse James' life. It felt like a biography and yet you were living it with them.If anything this is the furthest from a typical Hollywood Western and yet still holds some of the elements from that genre. There isn't any distinct bad guys or good guys, white hats or black hats, dusty towns with an angry sheriff. This feels like the real thing with brilliantly bleak landscape and gray clouds all around and tiny hand built cabins where they live. Train robberies, and gun shoot outs and horse riding are plenty but it all feels like it could have happened and was happening right in front of you. There were actually several scenes that were so brilliantly filmed (the film was also nominated for an Oscar in cinematography) that will literally make you want to pause the film and just look at it. Simplicity and yet completely moving. I would call The Assassination of Jesse James a historical epic at it's finest but in the most subtle of ways. I keep using that word because it is exactly what the film is all about subtly that will jump up and turn into a very powerful film when you least expect it. Rather than ending the film with James' assassination we get to see the following events surrounding his death including a very excellent re-creation of the infamous photos of his body. We also get to follow Robert Ford in his life following his infamous Assassination on James right up to his own death which I think was very clever of the film makers. If you love history, or really do appreciate a beautifully shot, well acted, powerful film you won't be disappointed with this one. Two and a half hours feels like an hour. 9/10",9,3,6,21 July 2008
Tigerland," Intense shock value overshadows brilliant story
","Tigerland is nothing short of average. Despite it's critical acclaims and longstanding fans I found the film to be just okay and went straight for shock value which in a film about war, in particular a brutal war such as Vietnam this could be a good thing but the shock value doesn't come from war but just pure mainstream 'R' Rated Garbage. Tigerland will burn out your ears from even the most seasoned swearer...brings a new meaning to swears like a sailor. There are some brilliant and incredibly emotional performances and a great story as well but it's overshadowed but what seems to me to be unrealistic violence and if I am wrong I gladly take it back.Tigerland takes place entirely in a fiction 'boot camp' of sorts that trains young soldiers to go to Nam. If Americans truly treated each other in this fashion which is nothing short of horrible torture to each other, and completely undemocratic behavior. Joel Schumacher is definitely a seasoned director and has done everything from comic adaptations (two Batman films) to action, to suspense to musicals. He seems to me to be a 'hit and miss' director. He doesn't really have a defined style and some of his films are good and some aren't and I think it more depends on the story presented to him than his direction.Tigerland is fascinating in the way that it's a completely different angle on the Vietnam war. Instead of seeing actual battle we see soldiers preparing to go to a war that most of them don't believe in, we see their lives that they don't want to leave and beneath their tough exterior. Colin Farrell who is generally heralded for this film does a good job, don't get me wrong, in fact it might be one of his best performances as the defiant and seemingly selfish Pvt. Roland Bozz. But he's not the stand out role in the film. He does a good job and his character development is excellent but it's not stunning. Instead some of the lesser roles turn out to be the really watchable ones. Clifton Collins Jr. plays Pvt. Miter who tries his utmost to fit in but ends up in a serious break down. Shea Whigham as the insane, angry Pvt. Wilson also does a great job. Combined with all the other seemingly minor roles these characters create an intense, dark and gritty atmosphere. Unfortunately this is overshadowed with graphic sex scene, horrid language and brutality that seems unrealistic. The story itself seems filled with plot holes. If soldiers were truly tortured in this nature why would they let soldiers go so easily?? It raises too many questions being entirely fictional. Nonetheless for adults who really want to see a different angle on the Nam war. 7/10",7,0,0,3 September 2005
Toy Story 4," Proof of Disney's prowess
","Let's be honest, this could have been a complete disaster. It could have completely tarnished a nearly untouchable franchise and trilogy. Many people call this the sequel no one needed/wanted but much to our surprise...it's good. It's great even. It lacks a few key things in my opinion that the original three had but it still is a just little prologue to Woody's story. I also think interestingly that much like Toy Story 3 this was made more for the adults that grew up watching Toy Story 1/2 then it is for the kids of this generation. I think my daughter (she's 4) enjoyed it but it is kind of sad, a little creepy, and certainly has Woody at the forefront of the film. One of the things that makes Toy Story so great is all the characters and this one put the main group in the background significantly and that was a little tough to swallow. They have a few key moments but overall, they are reduced to minor supporting characters. We got to meet Ducky and Rabbit and Forky and Duke Kaboom in an sadly small role but all of whom are great additions to the cast and our somewhat villainous Gaby Gaby who also is a good addition.Tom Hanks is magnificent as Woody once again and this story is solely about wrapping his storyline up and it shows. You will leave with some mixed feelings about how this story ends but overall it is fun and exciting and keeps the Toy Story spirit alive and they did a good job of bringing it back one last time (allegedly.) . 8/10",8,1,3,8 July 2019
Batman Begins," Lives up to all the rage and hype!!
","So intensely close to perfect, it's frightening. The Batman franchise created by Bob Kane has stood the test of time for over 6 decades and there has to be a reason for that? Use the basics, don't stray from what was created and that's what Batman Begins has done. Batman is about Bruce Wayne and his quest for vengeance and justice, what created him, how does he fight so well?? Batman Begins gives us all that and so much more.Bruce Wayne treks across the world to escape the guilt he feels about his parents' brutal murder by a street thug. He comes across the mysterious Ducard who works for someone named Ra's Al Ghul who is in command of 'The League of Shadows.' Ducard leads Wayne to their temple and begins to train him mercilessly and purge him of his fears and guilt creating the perfect vigilante skilled in the arts of Ninja and utilizing fear. Wayne is distraught to learn that Ra's Al Ghul only trained him to lead a ninja army back to Gotham and destroy it believing it to be an evil city that needs to be wiped out. Wayne destroys the temple and only saves Ducard. He returns to Gotham where he has been absent for 7 years. His company, Wayne Enterprises is being broken up and sold on the public stock market, and his faithful butler and former guardian Alfred meets him to welcome him home. Wayne explains his plans to become a symbol of justice and fear against the evil. With the help of Wayne Enterprises Tech man Lucius Fox Wayne gets everything he needs to become the thing he feared the most...The Bat. Big time mobster Carmine Falcone is moving drugs into Gotham for an investor who he is communicating with him through Jonathan Crane. Crane is using the drugs to experiment on patients in Arkham Asylum. The drugs cause the patients to go insane with fear. Crane himself is donning a mask that gases his victims and taking on the moniker of the Scarecrow. No one in law enforcement will touch Falcone, either being paid off by him or afraid to go after him by themselves like the district attorney, and Sargent Jim Gordon, a good cop without any help. Batman goes after him gets all the necessary leverage to help Gordon take him down and have him arrested. Bruce Wayne does his best to keep up his double life as Wayne and Batman until Crane's boss makes himself known, and will be Bruce Wayne and Batman's ultimate adversary in a battle to save Gotham from being completely obliterated with the insanity toxin.I so badly want to tack a huge 10 out of 10 on this but there is some slight downfalls to this fantastic film. Katie Holmes...she might be a good actress, I don't know, but she's not right for this role or this film. She sticks out from the rest of the cast and never fits. The ending of the film felt a little tacked on, like it was trying to wrap things up too quickly. I was a little disappointed with the entirely redesigned Batmobile which was more of a battle tank and the whole sliding under thing for the guns looked a bit ridiculous. Don't let any of that steer you away from the truly amazing job Christopher Nolan did with this film, not to mention the incredible actors in the film. How did Nolan bring the amazing Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman into this film?? Michael Caine as Alfred was a risky move. Caine is a big screen presence and could have overshadowed Christian Bale but they utilize him very carefully and make him an important part of Bruce Wayne's existence, as he should be, not just a butler but his friend, father figure, protector, partner. Liam Neeson also adds to this amazing cast as Wayne's trainer and mentor and also in a less than familiar role that I won't get into so as to not spoil the entire movie. Morgan Freeman plays a small but important role as the tech guy giving Bruce Wayne everything he needs to be Batman. Finally you have Gary Oldman who usually gets on my nerves but he's cleverly done up and plays a soft spoken yet honest cop in the future Commissioner Gordon. This cast clicks together amazingly. And finally and perhaps most importantly the absolutely stunning casting job of Christian Bale. This guy was MADE to play Bruce Wayne and Batman. Bale is like straight from the comic books into the movies. Both his portrayals are remarkable and he couldn't be any more DEAD ON!!! This guy ROCKS!! This film is so dead on accurate to the comics and yet translates it to the screen so flawlessly. Gotham is beautifully depicted and one of the greatest things is this film DOES NOT USE CGI or at least cleverly disguises it. A HUGE HATS OFF to Nolan for creating such an amazing action film with such little obvious CGI, it can be done!! This film takes us from Wayne's beginnings to his becoming The Batman. It shows us his fear, his emotions, his raw side. As Batman he shows anger, and revenge. The film is almost epic in scale and never focus' on just one aspect of Wayne or Batman. For any Batman, Super hero fan you need to see this film. I think they can definitely turn this into the new series and obliterate the mistakes made with the previous installments, but they have to keep the same level of class and creativity with it. The film is NOT as dark as everyone claims it to be but it's just right and fits the bill. A MUST SEE!! 9/10",9,2,5,20 June 2005
The Fault in Our Stars," The anticipation and reputation may have spoiled its significance
","The Fault In Our Stars was good. It was well acted, good story, very sad and moving at times. I fully expected (and maybe looked forward to) blubbering my way through it watching star-crossed terminally ill teenagers falling in love. I expected it to really impress me after If I Stay barely failed to impress me. The problem with The Fault In Our Stars is that I waited so long to see it and people talked endlessly about it. I knew every detail and people emphasized how sad it was and the characters and the book and you just heard about it constantly since the day it released in theatres. So by the time I finally sat down to watch it, it felt like I had almost been there and seen it. It was sad but maybe because the expectations is that it was desperately, soul wrenching sad that it underwhelmed me. In fact, for a story that seems to be very, very popular we have seen all of this before haven't we? This is not a new concept. Love Story? A Walk To Remember?...even The Notebook in some respects. Two young people inadvertently meet, he is the pinnacle of manhood and she is this adorable young, naive but sexy young girl and death will tear them apart. It is intense and the film is indubitably sad. Right from the opening monologue you know this isn't going to be a happy story.It appears as though Shailene Woodley is becoming an 'It' girl in Hollywood and I can understand why. I don't necessarily think shes an amazing actress but she has a very down to earth quality and her performances are solid and you relate to her. She's very 'girl next door' in all the right ways and for this role that is nearly perfect. She draws you into her world and you feel everything she does. Ansel Elgort is very similar. I don't necessarily think he'll ever win any Oscars but he is insatiably fun in the movie. You instantly understand her attraction to him and he's genuine and free spirited and teaches her about life. The two of them together are excellent. The key to a film like this is passion and chemistry and they've got it pretty good. It isn't amazing but its solid. Laura Dern and Sam Trammell are good but underused as Woodley's parents. I think I would have liked to have seen more interaction between Woodley and them in regards to her own illness. Both are good actors. A surprise cameo and a great addition is that of Willem Dafoe as an angry writer who Woodley idolizes until discovering how full of hate he is. Dafoe really stands out being such a near-legend in his own right.I hate to be so pessimistic but I can't help but feel The Fault In Our Stars is one of those movies that everybody loves because everybody loves it. It happens to be the latest 'fad.' I feel that its actually not really age appropriate for its intended audience but I get that Teens now are a lot more intense than they once were. For this to have such a high score on IMDb doesn't make sense to me. It is a GOOD movie but it is far from a GREAT movie. Its tried and true material done again in a decent way with a decent cast and no more or less. Josh Boone who directs has very little big screen experience but that being said he does a very good job and I'm certain his career will skyrocket after this. So look at it this way...teens are in love with this right now because everyone is talking about it. If you have seen your fair share of romances you will enjoy it and much like me you'll think...oh that was sad and cute...but memorable? Hardly. Just a good movie to entertain. 7.5/10",7,0,2,18 September 2014
Twilight," Proof that mass hysteria can sell a film
","How can I speak ill of a movie that made over half a billion dollars and launched one of the most successful film franchises of all time. That, however, does not make a good or even entertaining film. I will say for the record the Twilight films got better with time and maturity but this first film was dead on arrival and not in a good way. I read the first Twilight book years ago, long before I saw the film, and I found it just too sappy for my lacking. Well this film makes the book look like a Pulitzer Prize winner. The acting is downright awful, some of the worst I have ever seen. And the thing is I don't think the cast are bad actors. I often wondered throughout the film is the director purposely ordered the cast to act really bad. The romance that holds this entire series together is creepy and obsessive and just downright terrible. The story for Twilight crawls along and nothing of any significance happens in the first film. I am completely mind blown that this was so popular but marketing was done so well and the hype was in full swing so it hooked everyone in.I don't believe Robert Pattinson is a bad actor. I've seen him in Remember Me, where he did a decent job, but he just exudes awful in this movie. He acts like a horrible Harlequin Romance cover and his look, his style, his dialogue is just atrocious. Kristen Stewart is also not a bad actor. Also for the record, although this is an unpopular opinion, I don't think she does awful in this movie. Its not great but she does okay with what she's given. I also think her chemistry with Pattinson which is supposed to be this epic passionate earth shattering love is pathetic and creepy. Their scenes together will make you laugh out loud. Billy Burke does a good job as Bella's father, Taylor Lautner is okay in a small role in the film introducing us to Jacob. Edi Gathegi is okay as the killer vamp in the film but he gets treated and performs like a B-Movie actor. The rest of the cast are all lumped together as sub par silly and over acted.I think everyone should wake up and realize and be angry that director Catherine Hardwicke and everyone else involved in this film thinks that you're all foolish enough to enjoy this crap. Its dumbed down, its silly and pretentious and over-acted and just generally not interesting. I remember I started watching it years ago and I gave up half way through it was so awful but I wanted to force my way through it so I could see all of them and write a fair review. The movie probably scores a 5 in my book because it entertained me in the way that it made me laugh at the stupidity and the B-movie qualities. Plus the battle at the end was okay so its not the worst garbage I've ever seen. Still if you haven't seen Twilight...don't...save yourself the suffering even if they do get better. 5/10",5,1,5,15 January 2012
Wreck-It Ralph," Absolutely ridiculously adorable
","I went into Wreck-It Ralph with very high expectations. My friends had all raved about it and the idea of it being loosely based around 80's Arcade games and featured various video game characters had me incredibly excited for it. I will say that the tone of the film was very, very different than what I expected. I think I expected it to be a little darker and a little more adult geared. I wasn't disappointed in it at all, in fact I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the movie was just adorably cute, filled with tons of decent, solid morals and lessons, great animation, terrific voices, and it's simply fun. The actual connection to old school gaming is pretty minimal in the grand scheme of things, though there are certainly a ton of hidden background references that go unnoticed at first glance. The movie is so sugary sweet (pun intended considering where most of the film takes place) that it was just a constant barrage of feel good scenes. I feel like I'm using words that might seem like a back handed compliment and I don't mean to. This is just a fantastic kids movie that adults won't find as much in as some of the other animated films nowadays. But this is the all time perfect family flick. I can't even fathom the amount of times I had a lump in my throat from nearly tearing up in this movie.As with most great Disney flicks, the voice cast is near perfect. John C. Reilly is completely and utterly perfect as the over-sized, bumbling Ralph. They couldn't have created a better voice than what he provides. Sarah Silverman might annoy me in person but she is absolutely brilliant as the adorable and rambunctious Vanellope. Jack McBrayer is perfect as Fix It Felix. Felix even looks a little like McBrayer. He tones himself down from his usual over the top comedy making him likable and the perfect hero to Reilly's Ralph. I wasn't sure at first about Jane Lynch as Calhoun. I didn't think she fit the character right at first. However, by the end I was completely into her character and forgot she was Jane Lynch and she really won me over. Alan Tudyk (who sounds exactly like the Mad Hatter from Disney's 1950's Alice in Wonerland) is decent as King Candy, our real main villain. His storyline and character is fun if not just a little predictable.Director Rich Moore is clearly dedicated to animation. He loves his craft and puts his heart and soul into this movie. It is the type of feel good film that you don't get to see often anymore in animation or otherwise. Its funny and cute without any sort of toilet humour and resorting to cheap laughs. Fix-It Felix is a brilliantly realistic 8 Bit Arcade game. I'm surprised that they didn't create the actual game because it would have completely worked. Animated is of a high standard nowadays and Disney manages to prove once again why they are King of animation with this wholly unique throwback cute comedy that everyone will love. 9/10",9,3,4,8 March 2013
Bridesmaids," Over-hyped, and mis-represented excuse for female comedy
","I know exactly why Bridesmaids was so successful. Women wanted a dirty, raunchy, fun, slapstick, laugh out loud comedy for them, just like guys got The Hangover. Making a film like this would have to be instant gold at the box office and it was!! Why did I dislike it? Well first of all it was completely misrepresented. People that call this the female Hangover are just desperately trying to make themselves believe that. There was no wild and crazy adventure in this film. They get on the airplane for what like five minutes and then the rest is surrounding the wedding and the fancy homes and the city they reside in. The entire film focuses on the Maid of Honors mental break down and barely even touches the other 'Bridesmaids' which again misrepresents the film. Everything that people say about this movie I just don't see. The script for this film is some of the most awkward dialogue I've ever seen on the big screen. It felt like a two hour SNL skit that wasn't funny. I think I would have scored this less than five if even just a little of the hype didn't rub off on me and I didn't completely want to cut my wrists watching it.Kristen Wiig is Bridemaids. The whole film revolves around her and her breakdown leading up the wedding. Wiig is really the same as she is when she's playing her awkward SNL characters. I suppose some are big fans of that but to me it was just way too much over and over and over again. She has no chemistry on screen. I could say almost the exact same thing about Maya Rudolph only graciously she is almost underused in the film and she is definitely toned down from her SNL performances or her recent turn on the sitcom Up All Night (a good show by the way.) Rose Byrne is the snooty rich friend who becomes an instant nemesis to Wiig's character. Their rivalry is the basis of the entire film, and is focused on about an hour too much of the entire film. Receiving a ton of accolade for this film is Melissa McCarthy as the raunchy cousin. She is funny and she might be the only strong performer in the film. I think she is typecast in her comedy because of her size but it works for her. The other Bridesmaids gals Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper are barely noticeable and get buried under the rest of the cast. I'm not sure why they are even there. Chris O'Dowd is the love interest for Wiig and he's good but he exudes the same awkwardness that clouds the entire film.If there is one scene that boils down how I feel about this film it's the toasting scene with Wiig and Byrne. It feels like it's improvised and it also feels like its never going to end and the awkward angle is not funny because its already been done throughout the entire film...again extended SNL skit. No funnier than MacGruber (I've never seen it but I can imagine.) Director Paul Feig has had a long successful career in acting and directing. A lot of his direction is from off-beat comedies like Arrested Development, Freaks and Geeks, and The Office and it shows. Shows like that also thrive on an awkward comedy and this is really right up his alley. I think he's lucky that Bridesmaids hit all the right chords for people, came around at the right time and the right place but I'm sure I'm not the only one that thought it was over hyped and just not very funny. Sorry ladies...this one is a dud. 5/10",Null,6,9,22 October 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Jackson is back in full form like he was never gone. If you love LOTR you will love The Hobbit
","I remember seeing the first three Lord of The Rings films in the theatre and honestly finding them sort of boring and uninteresting. Maybe they just weren't my genre or I wasn't in the mood. Since I have rewatched them on video I have come to really appreciate and enjoy them. So I was looking forward to seeing Peter Jackson come back again. First of all I don't believe for a second that anyone could have made this happen in the same way other than Peter Jackson. I fear for the sequels if he doesn't helm them. No one knows middle earth like Peter Jackson. The film feels exactly like the original trilogy like you haven't been gone for a second. For that reason alone Jackson deserves accolades for giving his fans exactly what they expect. The cinematography and special effects are gorgeous, absolutely stunning. The CGI (which I am particularly critical of) is the very best of the best. There was only one scene out of dozens and dozens that I thought looked hokey. Whether or not the film needs to be three hours is much discussed and to a whole lot of pointless chatter because we all know Jackson does what Jackson wants. However, I did feel it dragged a lot and some of the more action packed scenes felt forced into the story.Martin Freeman is nothing short of brilliant as Bilbo Baggins. He gives a first class performance as the original adventuring Hobbit. He is so completely believable as the younger version of Ian Holm's older Bilbo. When I heard Ian Mckellen was returning to the Hobbit, I assumed it would be as a cameo or supporting character more along the lines of the original trilogy. Instead Mckellen returns as a major player, a main character. He is terrific and commands screen presence. He was born to play this role and proves it yet again. Richard Armitage is an excellent swashbuckling hero. He fills the void left by Viggo Mortensen very good though doesn't have quite the same charisma on screen. The rest of the dwarf adventurers are all great and you're certain to find your favorite but the problem is that it is such a huge group that no one dwarf gets the opportunity to stand out. They all sort of blend together and you often lose track of who is who. The various villains are all excellent, both the special effects that create them and the various voices behind them.You wouldn't expect anything more from Peter Jackson than a sprawling ambitious epic and that is what he has done. Does it show a touch of ego? Absolutely. But for a man who created a billion dollar empire worth of movies and then comes back to do it all over again with the same recipe and the same feel and create legions of fans all over again. It certainly establishes itself firmly as the first part of a trilogy and unlike Fellowship of the Ring it actually felt like there was more closure at the ending but also a huge opening leaving you wanting to come back for more. The first half of the film left me wondering how much I was actually enjoying this, and the second half of the film (which I really think was superior) made me glad I was seeing this. Was it brilliant? Honestly, I don't know if I would say brilliant...I mean he has done this exact same thing before. But it was well done, entertaining and a worthy entry into the Lord of The Rings universe. Tolkien would still bow to Jackson. 8.5/10",8,2,13,20 December 2012
Non-Stop," Neeson fans may find this outing a little dry
","Liam Neeson has been a Hollywood heavyweight for awhile. He's a versatile and well known actor with the most debonair Hollywood vibe about him. But I don't think it was until Taken became a run away smash action hit that Neeson was catapulted (at 56 years old) to action hero bad ass. He followed that every year with another 'actioner' type hit like The Grey, Taken 2 and Unknown. So Non-Stop was destined to be a hit. He is sort of mirroring the type of action career Bruce Willis saw in the late eighties following his Die Hard fame. Non-Stop is a decent film, but its far from great. It feels very rushed, was definitely put together to put out Neeson's next big pre-spring hit. His character is very flawed and that's okay but they really focus on his flaws. The mystery that is happening is okay but the suspects are everywhere and most of them feel a little forced and obvious. Its sort Wes Craven's Scream but in an air-plane. The pacing of the film is good and it isn't dull by any means. Considering the entire film takes place in that air-plane, it never feels confined except when they want it to. The mystery aspect could be compared to Neeson's other hit 'Unknown' but I felt that mystery had much better writers and more thought put into it.Thanks to Liam Neeson's undeniable charisma on screen he definitely keeps Non-Stop doing exactly that. While his alcoholic deeply disturbed character might be a little dark for this film, he pulls it off and you still root for him. A lesser actor would have made you not care whether he succeeded or not. Julianne Moore...ohhh Ms. Moore. Sometimes I just can't handle you. She's definitely on my least favourite actors list and yet sometimes she manages to surprise me (Carrie remake) but this was no exception. Moore is bland, boring, and she overacts a very simple character that was almost unnecessary. She is sort of the Sandra Bullock of Speed but with none of the chemistry, charisma or story. Moore is a waste and brings the cast down. The only other member of the supporting cast I feel is worth mentioning specifically would be Corey Stoll who plays an irate and macho NYPD officer who gets into Neeson's face a lot. His character is blatant, obvious, and not unique in any way but he does as good as he can with what the script gives him. Blink and you'll miss a tiny role from recent Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o, a wide eyed deer in the headlights performance from Michelle Dockery (was there something more to her relationship with Neeson? It felt implied but never explored), and decent supporting roles from Scoot McNairy and Nate Parker.Non-Stop is decently entertaining. It won't floor you by any means and it isn't anything absurdly unique but it is what it is...a thriller and it serves that purpose. Jaume Collet-Serra is a mostly new director but he did helm the absolutely brilliant horror/thriller Orphan and this is not nearly as smart as that was. But he definitely holds your attention and keeps you on the edge just enough. I think the biggest stumbling block for Non-Stop is the script. Its a little messy and unpolished and feels rushed. The writing team has very little credits to their names and the projects they have worked on are not anything like this. Still if you're in the mood for a popcorn flick and go in with mediocre expectations you'll come out feeling good. Its a far cry from Neeson's best but it works. 7/10",7,1,2,23 March 2014
The Pianist," Beautiful, horrifying, haunting and brilliantly made. Truly a masterpiece.
","The Pianist absolutely deserved all it's acclaim in 2002 including some Oscar Nominations. For every moment that it is so incredibly disturbing, and provocative there is a moment of heartfelt survival, a story of overcoming these disgusting, horrible moments in history. I thought even after the first half hour of the film that even though The Pianist was great, it was going to be stereotypical in it's story about the Holocaust and World War Two and I could not have been more wrong. This is not a film about the horror of those years but rather the story of one man's survival against unbelievable odds. It is truly an epic about one man. The first hour will literally bring you to tears, turn your stomach, it puts you right in the thick of this horrible historical war and the last part of the movie you struggle along with the main character in his own personal battle to survive. What an incredible journey!! I often wondered before seeing this film if Adrien Brody deserved his Oscar win. Yes, Yes, YES!! This is practically a one man show for Brody who plays famous Polish Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Practically every scene Brody is in will bring tears to your eyes. He seems like such a shy, withdrawn man who won't survive any of the heavy moments of the war ahead but he does...against all odds. He loses literally everything, everyone, his entire existence and fights on and on. In the beginning he shies away from the conflict, does everything he can to not stick out but in the end he perseveres above everything. No other film about the Holocaust or World War 2 has captured the plight of a Jew more than this film. We see every angle of the horror they endured and the people that they were and the lives that they lost. Brody may go down in history as being known for his passionate, excitable kiss with Hale Berry when presented with his award but now that I've seen the film I will forever remember his powerful performance. Now when I said this was a one man show for Brody I don't mean to count out the supporting cast in this film because they were all very, very good. Frank Finlay, Maureen Lipman, Emilia Fox, and Ed Stoppard all do a terrific job as Brody's family. They are only a small part of the film, the first hour perhaps but they do a great job of making you feel for them before they are taken to really get an idea of how Brody's character feels. Everyone who helps Brody's character along the way all play a terrific role but they are all quite small roles especially in comparison to Brody. This is his absolutely his masterpiece!! The incredibly controversial director Roman Polanski captures gritty, dark, human abomination like no one else. Even his more recent Oliver Twist was dark and disturbing appropriately but I think this particular project was close to home for him. He so brilliantly captured Warsaw and the Ghetto and the concentration camp and the war from the perspective of the civilians, especially the Jews, rather than the front lines. The film very gray scaled, a constant feeling of foreboding throughout the entire thing. Not a single frame feels light or happy and it shouldn't. There is silence before the deafening sound of gunfire, the crack of someone being murdered, or the bombs that could kill anyone in it's path. He really works at setting the horror of the situation in the first hour and accomplishes that hands down. I could feel my stomach turning watching these men torture these human beings in despicable horrifying ways. He then allows the last half of the film to be about Brody's character and survival. There is actually a happy ending to a horrific story. How rare to see something like this. It will haunt you, leave you thinking, remembering, praying, it's quite simply brilliant. Initially I had scored this a 9/10 and I don't know why because it is deeply powerful. Perhaps a little long but nonetheless captivating. I change it to a 10/10 because of the important message of remembrance and a time where a people, human beings were treated like less than garbage. May something like this never happen again!! Please watch this movie if you're a fan of history, or just want something powerful, intelligent, and moving. 10/10",10,0,2,25 June 2006
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A total surprise gem for me and possibly one of the most unique comedies I have ever seen
","I think I've seen a few Wes Anderson movies and I know his reputation for being very eccentric and quirky in his films. Its not usually my cup of tea but after experiencing The Grand Budapest Hotel I might have to re-address the opinion and watch some more of his work. I'm not a big fan of comedy, least of all dirty, raunchy stupid comedy but this comedy was like nothing I have ever seen and it turns out was right up my alley. Make no mistake, this is a comedy. This is the sort of zany, outrageous comedy that made Monte Python an iconic group. The story makes perfect sense and is not confusing in the least and yet this incredibly bizarre cast of characters in an incredibly outrageous series of events feels completely surreal. Its just some of the most random things happening and yet you're laughing and shaking your head at the insanity of it all. In addition to that this was easily one of the most visually stunning, colourful, and outrageous set design I have ever seen. This 'faux' European backdrop turns this into the ultimate fairy tale for adults. The Grand Budapest Hotel should have been an Oscar contender if not for visual style than just how incredibly unique it is. This proves that there are still some original ideas kicking around in Hollywood and Wes Anderson deserves mounds of credit.Ralph Fiennes is talented...we all know that. He's never really been a favourite of mine, I just always thought he was okay. He is comedy gold in this. Gustave H. will go down in my personal books as one of the greatest comedy characters ever. He is completely outrageously manic and ridiculous and has this air of sophistication about him. It was a brilliant, brilliant performance. 'I'm afraid that's me darling.' Poor Tony Revolori is hardly mentioned and is fully a main character in the film. He gets buried under the crowd of big names performing with him. But he shouldn't be ashamed because he is brilliant in this as well. He plays lobby boy 'Zero.' Him and Fiennes play so well off of each other and he's sort of the straight man to the story and just performs so well. You will quickly find yourself endeared by him. I honestly wish I had ten pages to talk about all the characters in this. You will recognize so many faces as amazing character actors. But some have bigger roles than others (Tilda Swinton, Willem Dafoe and Jude Law are just sort of there.) But the true magic of this supporting cast is in the small roles that make a big impact. Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Edward Norton (loved his role!) and Saoirse Ronan stood out to me in a big way. Small roles but a lot of fun and very effective in their performances. The cast just jives and works so well in the confines of this amazingly unique script.I guess what I'm saying is that I am now a Wes Anderson fan. This is a feat of film making period. It is the furthest thing from mainstream and it won't even remotely be everyone's thing. I didn't think it would be mine either. Since the first moment I saw the trailer, something called out to me. This looks zany and stupid and foolish and I kind of want to see it. Its not stupid or foolish. Film critics should love it, fans of something different should adore it. This could easily sneak its way into my favourite movies category and slip its way to being a perfect ten after a few more views. It is also chock full of amazing one liners, brilliantly written slapstick comedy and I will be quoting for the rest of my life. Want something completely outside the box? Wes Anderson doesn't even use the vicinity of the box when he made this and it is all good!! 9/10",9,4,7,15 June 2014
The Transporter," The rise of an action star
","Not many knew Jason Statham prior to becoming The Transporter but no one in the action genre has forgotten him since and for good reason. The Transporter is a rip roaring, red blooded, action packed flick that will leave you cheering and enjoying every minute of it. It has absolutely everything you could possibly need from an action movie. The gruff, tough hero, a European background, organized crime, martial arts, stunts, explosions, car chases...and everything else. Best of all it does actually have good story even if its completely predictable and simplistic but there is nothing wrong with that as long as it works and it does!! Statham is as bad-ass as any legendary action star you can think of. His character of Frank has more depth than you think at first and his good guy side wins out every time. This is one of my all time favourite action characters. Qi Shu plays Lai, Frank's package to be delivered, that turns out to be more than expected. She does alright although her wild nature makes her sort of annoying and she is often hard to understand. The chemistry between her and Statham is decent but not perfect. Really also enjoy the performance by François Berléand as Inspector Tarconi, the adversary/friend to Frank. I enjoy their banter and their storyline and they could have used it more both in this one and future sequels.Creator and writer Luc Besson is synonymous with action. The Professional, The Fifth Element, Unleashed, Taken...just to name a few of my personal favourites. Simply put he knows what people love in an action film. First timer Louis Leterrier helms the film and clearly does a great job. He went on to do some very big projects like the sequel to this and Clash of The Titans. I think he's probably a big action film fan himself and so he handles the story, content and character perfectly. If you love action even a little you should be watching this right now. It is the perfect flick to enjoy yourself beginning to end and look forward to the sequels. Jason Statham will win you over every time. 9/10",9,0,3,12 January 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Proving that Mission Impossible is still the best action franchise out there
","I think, in my opinion, Mission Impossible simply keeps getting better and better with each instalment. I am relieved and excited this film did so well because regardless of anything Tom Cruise does in his personal life he is still a stone cold movie star and fantastic at what he does. And Mission Impossible is fantastic as what it does. They managed to come back after a five year hiatus as if they didn't miss a beat and bring us absolutely everything that makes this series fantastic. Exotic locales, crazy gadgets, break neck action, edge of your seat thrills, a terrific new team, and continuity to the rest of the series. As always, the series starts right from square one with incredible action, a daring escape and an update on our favourite agent Ethan Hunt. I thought that Mission Impossible 4 had a bit less edge and dark to it especially with the addition of Simon Pegg on the team. But they didn't tone down the action for a moment and Cruise looks as smooth as he ever did doing the stunts and crazy scenes.I hope that this is a comeback of sorts for star and producer Tom Cruise. This made me see the star quality that made Cruise who he is. He is simply bad-ass as Hunt and there has been a general progression to his character through these films since 1996 and Ethan is a little darker, a little more jaded, but still ready for anything. As much as they'd like co-star Jeremy Renner to take over this series I don't think it could survive without Cruise in some capacity. Jeremy Renner is, however, very good in his role as newcomer to the team Brandt. He has a dark side to him, and a mysterious background that adds to the plot. He has good chemistry with Cruise and doesn't take away from the star of the series. I was a little wary with having Simon Pegg as part of the main team. He was okay as a very small gadgets guy in Mission Impossible 3 and as it turns out he actually fit in pretty well in this one too. He was obviously the comic relief but it was used mostly carefully although I think still just a tad too much. Paula Patton is the newest lady on the team and she does well but I don't think she has quite the same amount of on screen charisma as previous Mission Impossible girls. Michael Nyqvist (of the original The Girl With Dragon Tattoo fame) is decent as the main villain. He certainly looks the part and does his job well enough although much like Patton I'm not sure he was the best villain in the series.One of the most amazing scenes of the entire series and in action film history is the explosion of the Kremlin which was absolutely mind blowing special effects. As with previous instalments of the franchise there are just a few key scenes that are absolutely riveting and stunning to watch and as action fans you will want to cry out loud at how cool they really are. There is also some great cameos at the end for fans of the franchise that hold together that ever important continuity to the whole series. This is one action flick you can't let pass you by and if you have yet to see the entire series, then you're truly missing out, with the exception of Mission Impossible 2 which was a bit of a mis-step I think. This was one of the greats in 2011 as late in the year as it came. Keep them coming!! 9/10",9,5,9,24 January 2012
Foxcatcher," Fascinating but definitely slow burning
","I try not to use the same terms to describe films in my reviews but they are regularly used phrases for a reason. The first review I read on IMDb after watching this said a slow burning thriller to an explosive climax and that pretty much sums it up. I admit I had a lot of expectations for this. I thought this would blow me away given I really like Steve Carell and I wanted him to show off the chops I know he has. I even wanted Channing Tatum whom I'm not a huge fan of, to impress me and I thought this was the perfect vehicle. I don't have a 'but' to follow this with. Foxcatcher is a very good movie. Its a very interesting story that I had never heard of before and it was the type of film that really makes you think and sticks with you after its over. Its an effective, real life thriller/drama with some good performances. But nothing about it in my opinion was particularly 'great.' Its a haunting story and the tension it builds is very good. The bizarre relationship between Mark and John du Pont is very disturbing but I couldn't help but wonder if du Pont was actually this far mentally disturbed. Would anyone have let this man go this far deep into eccentricity? Either way its a story worth seeing but many will find it very slow I am sure. It definitely builds at its own pace to a thunderous and disturbing climax that literally made me jump in my chair despite knowing it was coming.Steve Carell is one of my favourite comedians and that's not an easy feat because I'm very particular about my comedy. But I also knew he had a lot more depth in him to perform. This certainly proves he can do drama. Obviously the physical transformation in the film is amazing but that isn't really a feat in itself other than for the make-up people. I don't know anything about du Pont so perhaps if I saw him and his mannerisms I would be more impressed with his performance. Carell's performance is subtle but definitely twisted at times. I'm not sure its deserving of an Oscar nomination but he still gives a good performance that you will be surprised by. Channing Tatum is also good as Olympic Wrestler Mark Schultz. Tatum gives a similar performance because its sort of subtle but there is something odd about him and his character. I'm not sure if Schultz was supposed to come across as not very bright but that's how he's portrayed. The dynamic between Tatum and Carell is incredibly strange and drives the film. Its such an odd story and relationship. Both are very good but short of great. Mark Ruffalo is decent but sort of underused and is just kind of there. He doesn't really do anything outstanding with his role but also doesn't make the climax any less shocking. Sienna Miller and Vanessa Redgrave are also quite underused in the film but their presence is significant enough.I hated Moneyball...despised it. Director Bennett Miller got all kinds of acclaim for a film that was excruciatingly boring. I would love to have seen Foxcatcher in the hands of someone who could build a little more story to these characters. Still, Miller has redeemed himself in my book by creating something very dark and gritty and factual that you really have to keep watching. No matter how slow it feels from time to time you are completely compelled to keep watching. I'm a little disappointed after reading the real story of how du Pont was caught (he apparently holed himself up in his home for two days negotiating with police) that they ended the film the way they did. I understand that they had to for time sake but the story feels incomplete without knowing that piece of puzzle. Foxcatcher won't be for everyone because mainstream audiences will find it very slow but if you can appreciate it for depth and style and the characters then you will at least give it kudos. I don't think it holds a candle to other nominees this year at the Academy Awards but its worth seeing especially for those that love a true to life story or different style of thriller. 8/10",8,2,6,1 February 2015
28 Days Later...," Cult classic certainly spins a different sort of genre
","28 Days Later is not a zombie film. It's usually mistakenly referred to as that and usually compared with Night of The Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead and the likes and the comparisons are not unfounded but still very misguided. I think director and creator Danny Boyle created something very unique and introspective when it comes to the horror zombie genre. Somewhere amidst the gore and gratuitous bad language is some sort of moral about people and survival and people killing people but it's kind of lost in the fact that ultimately this is a horror, blood splashing gore fest with zombie like creatures that are still not intelligent but fast moving and really angry. The landscape of England is a brutally isolated and disturbing setting for the film and the gray and dreariness of it really puts you in the mood for the story. Enter not only terrifying rage filled human creatures but deranged and sadistic soldiers and a small group of survivors who bond over their situation. The great thing about this film compared to something like Night of The Living Dead and the sequels and remakes and such is that 28 Days Later has far more of an interesting story complete with an actual beginning, climax and end and surprisingly the ending is almost a happy one or has the potential for a happy ending.Cillian Murphy, looking disturbingly sickly and pale, plays Jim, the hero to the story. Murphy is terrific in this role because he's dark and mysterious but quickly adapts to having to survive. I almost didn't recognize Murphy because his performance was so different from his more mainstream films as of late. He didn't look as evil and bad guy as he usually does but instead plays Jim with a certain subtly and importance and his character really changes throughout. Naomie Harris plays Selena, another survivor who ends up teamed up with Jim after saving his life. Harris is the perfect balance to Murphy's Jim. Whereas Jim is quiet, subtle, and dark, Selena is loud and bold, and touch and strong but still needs rescuing and needs to find faith again that all is not lost. Harris and Murphy have good chemistry and do a terrific job. Megan Burns is decent as the youngest group of their survival squad, Hannah. She has a lot of importance to the story and seems to become a hope for survival to Jim as he protects her. Unfortunately her role lacks something and she comes across as a little boring at times. Brendan Gleeson also plays a small yet very important role as Hannah's father Frank. He's a strong, down to earth character that will stop at nothing to protect his daughter.28 Days Later wasn't perfect. I didn't find it overtly scary as much as it was disturbing in a political and real way. The humans gone mad were far scarier than the ones infected. There were no jumps or chills just a lot of gore and blood and a half decent story as well. It felt like the type of movie that would jump start a series (which they are now into the second film which I can't wait to see.) Still as I stated earlier 28 Days Later is something completely different from an overplayed and dull genre and bravo to them for doing that. A strong cast and a decent story makes for a cult classic to say the least and I do see why people love it. I just thought it was a little dull at times and didn't really move at the pace that I had hoped. After watching the DVD's and the alternate endings I am really glad they ended it the way they did. It would have been very stereotypical for them to kill off everyone or almost everyone in the main cast but instead they actually spun it with a potentially happy ending. Part of the moral of the film is that Jim is determined to prove to Selena that all is not lost and that rings true in the end making everything fit together. Overall a good strong movie that many love. Definitely worth seeing if you're tired of the same old Zombie crap out there. 7/10",7,1,2,15 December 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," I know it's a classic and it's easy to see why but here's why it isn't perfect
","I finally decided to watch the classic Lawrence of Arabia in my attempt to catch up on film classics I have never seen. Now I don't for one minute intend on talking down about this film. It is easy to see why Lawrence of Arabia stands the test of time as a classic. The absolutely stunning breathtaking cinematography, the incredible 'would be' special effects that probably had to be done with man power and the thousands and thousands of extras used in stunning battle scenes and traveling across the desert. You can't get more spectacular than the scenery in this film. Hands down a huge 10/10 for what they did with the cast and scenery. The story is simple enough and based on a true story of World War II British soldier who finds himself conflicted on who he is truly fighting for when he becomes entangled with the Bedouin armies of Arabia. I also realize that this is an epic and that being said and being filmed in the sixties, historical epics were known to be lavish productions. I watched this film on a 2 disk DVD and at the end of the first DVD I was so pleased, I almost wanted to watch it again and again and slap a perfect score on it. I would have been just as happy to have it end right there. But as it turned out there was another disk with an hour and a half on it adding the total running time to an outstanding 3 1/2 hours and I have nothing against that unless it's not necessary. I found the last part of this film very unnecessary, it dragged, it bogged down the story and I found it quite confusing. Yes I understand that it brought about T.E. Lawrence's conflicted opinions about the war but it just almost felt like an anti-climax and sadly brought the film down for me.Veteran actor in his screen debut Peter O'Toole plays Lawrence. I think O'Toole perfectly captures everything Lawrence was meant to stand for. O'Toole as Lawrence is conceited, young, naive, bull headed, and has great delusions of grandeur which he uses to win over the Arabians. On top of these less than desirable traits Lawrence has incredible charisma and leadership qualities and O'Toole is the same way. At first he seems almost smug and monotone but the more you watch him the more he electrifies the screen and you become enamored with him. I don't know if that's talent of a gift but either way he makes the film what it is. The incredible Sir Alec Guinness plays Prince Feisal, the leader of one faction of the Arabian army who leaves his men to the trust of Lawrence after becoming enamored with him. It's not a big role but when Guinness is on screen he makes it larger than life. Anthony Quinn is the opposite leader Auda abu Tayi whom Lawrence brings together with Feisal's men to take Damascus away from the Turkish army. Quinn is much like Guinness who doesn't need a lot of screen time to make an impression. They are both worthy of royalty. And Omar Sharif is brilliant and intelligent as Sheriff Ali who becomes Lawrence's wing man and friend.The cast are all brilliant together, the story is of epic proportions and the direction which was Academy Award winning by David Lean is nothing short of brilliance. It might possibly be one of the best directed films I have ever seen. It's simply breath taking. But so much extra is added that I'm just not sure it was necessary. Lawrence becomes so conflicted and ends up leaving them and it just seems to contradict everything he had done. Perhaps I am just being petty about it and I didn't like the ending but nonetheless the last hour and a half was too much for me. Still I don't regret for a minute seeing it and I encourage everyone to see this because even now it's spectacular to watch, imagine how it felt more than 40 years ago. 8.5/10",8,13,21,5 February 2007
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Potentially better than the original? A new perspective.
","Years ago when I saw the first Jurassic Park in the theater as a kid, I was blown away, glued to my seat. I mean every kid is in love with Dinosaurs and Spielberg's brilliant Dino epic brought them to life unlike anything before or since. When I watched it again to review it just a few short weeks ago I was disappointed that somehow some of the magic had been lost. Whether it be seeing it too many times, or seeing in on a smaller screen, or just not having that wide eyed dino fascination anymore...something lacked although still a powerfully made and fun movie!! So then I watch The Lost World, which I had seen before as well but I seem to remember thinking all those years ago that it paled in comparison to the original but upon seeing it again I was taken aback that I might have actually enjoyed it more than the original and I think I understand why. In the first film Spielberg aimed to bring to life every child's imagination and create dinosaurs like we've never seen but I don't think he even expected the enormous response to the film. Everyone loved it, it brought the child out in all of us and adults, as opposed to kids made Jurassic Park a top grossing film world wide. So Spielberg knew that if he were to do a sequel he would try to appeal more to that surprise crowd hence we have a darker, more mysterious, slightly more violent Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World.Jeff Goldblum returns again as everyones favorite Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm who has been summoned to the side of Jurassic Park creator John Hammond. Goldblum gets all of his sarcasm and wit from the original film but gets even more personality being the star now. He is a little more serious this time around but he leads the film with class and expertise and makes a great hero. Joining the cast is Julianne Moore who I have never been a big fan of but as it turns out she does a really terrific job as Paleontologist Sarah Harding and Goldblum's girlfriend. She fills the role left by Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) very well. She is fun and strong and a great female lead and as odd as they seem together her and Goldblum have good chemistry. Richard Schiff as one of their team members is great if not short lived. He has good chemistry with the rest of the team and has a great character. Vince Vaughn even comes on board and doesn't take anything away from the story with his usual antics and instead plays a really great role as anxious photographer with morals Nick Van Owen. He turns in one of my favorite Jurassic Park characters. Great character actor Pete Postlethwaite is perfect as the angry, determined world hunter and although he doesn't get a big role it's great!! I was also very happy that they wrap up the story a little and had cameo appearances by original cast members Richard Attenborough, Joseph Mazzello, and Ariana Richards however brief they were.I read a lot of reviews for this film and it actually kind of surprised me how many people did not like this entry in the series at all. They especially seemed to hate the ending with the T-Rex in America and I think I might have not been a big fan originally either and yet watching it again it seemed to be amazing to me. It was the perfect idea...Hammond's disastrous creation coming home to roost so to speak. The action in the original Jurassic Park was non-stop thrill ride and this installment was no exception from the absolutely nail biting trailer scene with the baby T-Rex up to the chase through the city with the dinosaur. I think perhaps it boils down to having not seen this sequel as many times as the original but still I was very impressed and I loved it!! I have read the books years ago and I remember little to nothing about them so that doesn't effect my review either. I just felt that Spielberg made the story a little darker, more mature, and more gritty and violent without spilling into gratuitous by any means. Regardless the special effects are still spot on and it's a great follow up to a classic movie that must be seen so you can judge yourself. 8.5/10",8,2,3,4 September 2008
It Follows," Umm okay
","Halloween, Friday The 13th, Blair Witch Project...these were indie horror films that set records, created franchises and legends. Minimal budgets with up and coming actors and downright creepy scenes that were legendary. Nowadays, indie horror usually means really awful and It Follows is NOT awful. It doesn't feel low budget and that's a great compliment. Its well shot and has some genuinely good special effects and creepy scenes but it completely lacks the scare factor. There is nothing that really truly got under my skin and freaked me out. The characters are mostly empty although acted well and perhaps the biggest problem is that it feels like it goes on far too long. The pacing is not great. I might be a little harsh on it but I heard a lot of great things about this and a lot of comparisons to the equally hyped Babadook which was also 'just okay' It Follows definitely shows a lot of promise and shows a lot of talent in the film making department but as a horror film it just needs a lot of fine tuning. Its a good effort at demonstrating what they're capable of as a film maker but does that make it a good movie? The cast is okay. Everyone plays their role well enough but no one stands out as the hero. I mean, its clear who our scream queen is supposed to be but Maika Monroe just doesn't have the chops to carry the movie or make us care enough. Her friends all play their roles well enough but this isn't a cast you relate to or even can invest yourself in. Keir Gilchrist, Lili Sepe (who I actually thought showed more charisma than Monroe did), Daniel Zovatto and Jake Weary play decent roles but the script isn't good enough to really let them showcase what they could do.The film has some creepy scenes and some very nice cinematography but when you go into a film, especially a horror movie, you're not expecting to watch a wanna-be filmmaker trying to prove that he could make a good movie...you just want a good movie. The very inexperienced David Robert Mitchell writes and directs (I always warn about this) and I can say without a doubt that as a director he has a distinctive style and vision. However, he goes out of his way to make sure you see it instead of creating a clever movie and making it his own. The long laborious shots of the run down areas of Detroit are not necessary for this story. The plot itself is very bizarre and the ending is so abrupt that it actually makes you even more angry that you're getting so little out of it in the end. It Follows is okay but really not that much better than your run of the mill straight to DVD horror flick. It was unimpressive and forgettable. 6/10",6,1,21,4 July 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Brilliant re-telling/Prequel that is one of the best movies of the summer!
","I adore the original Planet of The Apes films, all of them, though it has been a few years since I've seen them. I started hearing great reviews for this one which is always a surprise for a Summer blockbuster especially in August where the lesser films are often released. On a whim and because it started at the right time I went into Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes and was met with a fantastic film! The special effects are brilliant and I rarely say that about a film that features almost entirely CGI graphics for its core effects but they are so well done. I'm still not sure about the accuracy of the ape behaviour before becoming so intelligent, sometimes they seem a little more entertaining than actual chimps but regardless it is amazing CGI. The character of Cesar (played by the master of the CGI performance Andy Serkis) is absolutely mind blowing. His eyes are so emotion filled, and you will literally just connect with him on a whole new level. The film also does an amazing job of playing homage to the original series (something Burton's remake tried) but this film has some really great Easter Eggs (my favourite being the Get your damn hands off me you dirty ape.) This film will make you laugh, literally cry, and feel anger and excitement and really does capture everything the original film did so many years ago.James Franco needs no introduction. The acclaimed actor who has literally done everything in sight and continues to headlines the cast as brilliant scientist Will Rodman. Franco plays his character subtly and while he doesn't get quite the depth we might be used to with some of Franco's character he is perfect in the lead. An everyman who happens to be brilliant and emotional. John Lithgow is a master of his craft from hilarious slapstick comedy (Third Rock From The Sun) to brilliant killers and dark dramas. He is a versatile actor and will be a legend someday if he isn't already. In this film he will break your heart as Franco's father who suffers from late stage Alzheimers. I would have actually liked to have seen more from him in the film as he steals every scene he is in. Tom Felton is in many ways your primary villain. I felt like at times his role was a little cheesy and overdone as the 'bully' but at the same time he gets some of the great lines, and you really will hate him with a passion until he gets what is coming to him. I did not even recognize him as the same youngster that played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter series so this should help him shake that role. David Oyelowo plays a rather stereotypical money/fame hungry boss for Franco. He's good for what they give him. Freida Pinto plays a small role as Franco's love interest over the course of several years. She's affectionate and a necessary part of the overall story but her character is plugged in there to add nothing more than a romance aspect to the film.This film is so close to being a ten for me. Where it fell short was the few performances that did not live up to that of Franco and Lithgow (Pinto, and Oyelowo) who felt underdeveloped to the story and not realistic enough for me. Also the ending of the film didn't have the knock out pizazz I had hoped for. I mean many people hated Burton's Planet of The Apes but at least he went for a shocker of an ending. Rise of The Planet Of The Apes just sort of ends. It wraps everything up neatly enough but I hungered for more. Sequel pleeease! Rupert Wyatt seems to be getting terrific reviews as director of the film. Wyatt clearly shows a terrific story telling ability and has a great handle on the Apes series and what it means to people. The film has such a morose tone at times watching Cesar suffer through his prison like existence and coming to terms with what or who he is. And also watching him lead his revolution, create this army and become smarter and smarter. Andy Serkis makes his character of Cesar the absolutely brilliant focal point of the film. It's Prison Break for Apes, and the whole thing builds to this immensely climatic moment where Cesar speaks for the first time. It will literally move you. The original Planet film actually fit Political and social commentary into the science fiction masterpiece and you can plainly see that this one does the same. The film has plenty to say under the skin about man's treatment of animals, man's treatment of their own kind and disease, and also social climate as we watch these apes revolutionize and revolt. This is a must see film and is sure to be considered one of the best perhaps of the year I hope because it is one of the best of the summer hands down!! 9/10",Null,0,2,16 August 2011
Cars," Cute but a step down from the usual Pixar/Disney Masterpieces
","Cars seems to be all the rage right now and that's awesome!! For me though I admit I was a little disappointed considering Pixar films have always scored at least a 9/10 on my scale. Cars didn't quite capture the usual magic of say The Incredibles or Over The Hedge. First and foremost it dragged a little long being two hours is a quite a feat for Pixar animated film. I'm not sure that it needed to be that long and the middle of the film dragged significantly. I think that really was one of the major things that dragged Cars down. On top of that despite a really cute and interesting supporting cast the main character of Lightning McQueen wasn't as strong as he needed to be. While it's important and a Disney specialty to have an interesting supporting cast they shouldn't outshine the lead character and they do for certain!!Owen Wilson voices Lightning McQueen, the hot shot race car rookie that ends up getting lost on his trek to the next big race. Wilson's voice is strong and fits McQueen well but the character is written with a bit of an understatement to him. He gets overshadowed by the supporting cast that has a lot more personality than McQueen. Paul Newman is terrific as Doc (in perhaps the veteran actors last role??) You can practically see Newman in the old, grumpy, and gruff former race car. The car's personality fits Newman's typical role perfectly. I admit one of the greatest moments in the film is in the last race scene when you hear Doc's voice over Lightning's pit crew head set...almost got me choked up. Bonnie Hunt is Lightning McQueen's romantic leading Porsche, Sally. I didn't recognize Hunt's voice at first but she does a terrific job voicing the intelligent and caring Sally. Larry The Cable Guy turns out probably the definitive Cars performance as lovable if not slightly missing a few bolts Mater. Mater is adorable and sincere and I thought Larry The Cable Guy's performance would annoy me like he does but he was just awesome!! Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, Guido Quaroni, Jenifer Lewis, John Ratzenberger and Michael Keaton all provide their voices to various supporting members that are all terrific. The small town of Radiator Springs is endearing and the perfect contrast to Lightning McQueen's fast paced, revving personality.I found Cars to be significantly slower paced than previous Pixar installments but it is true that characters and setting grow on you. I'm still not sure the film needed to be as long as it was. Still the story is there, the characters are undeniably cute and watchable and the Disney Moral of the story is still in tact. I can see why kids find themselves drawn to the characters each one being so different from the other and every person can find their favorites (Doc and Mater are my tops!!) Cars is absolutely one you should see, there is nothing over whelmingly disappointing about it, I'm just not sure adults will find it as entertaining as some of the other Pixar films as of recently. I don't mean to downplay the film, I just have to review it like I see it and although it has some major plus's Cars doesn't quite match some of it's predecessors. However my beautiful girl Sarah would vehemently disagree as she adored the film!! Cheers to her newest fave ;) 8/10",8,0,2,24 July 2006
JFK," One of the most important, brilliant, controversial films ever made...the questions linger
","I think JFK by Oliver Stone is my favorite film of all time...period. I have finally made that decision. I base that on content and the sheer amount of times I could sit through it and it's as powerful each and every time. Although I also might say I am quite biased towards the film having been a Kennedy fanatic and researcher since my early teens. I love Kennedy and the whole mystery and intrigue surrounding his death on November 22nd, 1963. And no film captivates, captures and defines that assassination like Oliver Stone's brilliant film. While being fiction and dealing with a real life situation he makes such a controversial, detailed, full of depth film that it you could literally get something different from every single time you watch it and I have each time. The film should have swept the Oscar's and should be consider THE MOST controversial film because I believe it's the only thing that comes close to bringing out the truth behind the Assassination (that's not up for debate...I'm simply reviewing the film.) Kevin Costner...some love him, some hate him...I have heard people describe Costner as drab, boring, unemotional, but I have never agreed. I love Costner's films and performances. I think he is an incredible talent of embodying the characters he portrays. He makes them real, he makes the every day guy no matter what the character is. He can be powerful, emotional, subtle, weak, misunderstood, ambitious, evil...I think he's a very diverse actor with underrated ability. I think his performance in this film as Jim Garrison is brilliant. There isn't a time yet in watching this film that I am not so incredibly moved as tears well up in Costner's eyes as he's giving his closing speech to the jury (rumoredly this was not planned but Costner felt the impact of his speech.) Costner captures the era and the important of Garrison's investigation and perfectly shows how this case completely consumed Garrison to the very end. The cast in this film is extensive, impressive and incredible. To name any one person and not another in this film seems almost unfair besides Costner as he is the main focus. Tommy Lee Jones is usually second to be headlined being he was nominated for his performance as Clay Shaw/Bertrand, the man accused of conspiracy in the President's murder and the only man ever to be brought to trial for such. Jones is brilliant, he's always brilliant, Tommy Lee Jones is one of the greatest actors of all time and this role is brilliant but it's a very, very small role. Cameo might even describe it but still he got his nominated as supporting actor and he is a big screen presence and him and Costner share some intense dialog. Gary Oldman is PHENOMENAL as Lee Harvey Oswald. The man is just brilliant in flash backs and recreations of actual news events. The voice, the look, everything about him is nailed and he has a very subtle brilliance and insanity to him and his look. Oldman should have gotten an Oscar hands down. Joe Pesci is also very good (although mostly typical Pesci as CIA contact David Ferrie.) He certainly nails the physical appearance and his performance is noteworthy and riveting. He definitely adds pizazz and excitement to the film with this high strung over the top personality. Kevin Bacon, Michael Rooker, Jack Lemmon, Laurie Metcalf, Sissy Spacek (in a notable role as Costner's estranged and upset wife,) John Candy, Jay O. Sanders, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, Edward Asner, and Wayne Knight are the bulk of the really notable performances in this film. All of them give so, so incredibly much to this film and make it come alive. Some of them have brilliant, detailed absolutely riveting monologues of information that any other time would come across as boring drivel and yet you watch and listen in awe as they list out the evidence. Bravo to each and every one of these actors because they made the most brilliant film ever made.Oliver Stone is no stranger to controversy. He's a brilliant, no holds barred director who makes jarring and stirring films. I haven't liked all his films but I can't deny his directorial brilliance and this is chief proof of that. He took an age old debate, something that has been rehashed to death and created an intriguing study. The film has less of a story and more of laying out facts in front of you for three hours and he does it with absolute ease and makes it compelling and interesting to everyone...researchers, fanatics, and just the average movie goer. So many powerful speeches, and moments in this film will just leave you stunned and wanting to watch the whole thing again because there is just SO much to take in. Whether you believe the evidence or not it's just as compelling to watch Stone direct a brilliant cast into a controversial film. This is without a doubt one of the top ten films you absolutely cannot live without seeing. It's important both as a film and to real life. For me it's also my number 1 film of all time. Consider that the best of the best. As I stated I am biased given my love for the subject but the film is still BRILLIANT!! Capturing the sixties, the assassination, the trial, the witnesses, the cover up...it's all done with such impressive style. 10/10",10,5,19,15 July 2006
Behind The Candelabra," A valiant effort but not entirely my cup of tea
","As much of a history guy I am, I know virtually nothing about Liberace. So this was literally my first experience of whom Liberace was. I can't even say whether or not it was accurate or not but from all accounts it sounds like this is the best possible dramatization of what his private life may have been. It is a good film, it is a good TV Movie, but it doesn't floor me in any way. At two hours long I feel like focusing the entire film on Liberace's relationship with Scott Thorson rather than at least a little bit about Liberace's career. But I understand this film is truly meant to document their relationship. In many ways it is a riveting story that is often hard to watch and its like being a fly on the wall of an extremely dysfunctional relationship. There are some powerhouse performance in the film that it wasn't until the film was over that I truly began to think about and appreciate. This isn't the film to advocate gay relationships because the two of them are like oil and water and this is an incredibly dysfunctional affair. The film has several familiar faces in cameo and supporting roles but surprisingly enough hardly any of them really stand out and make a solid go at their roles.Michael Douglas is Liberace himself. I wasn't sure at first that I liked his performance, I found him kind of irritating and then when I read a little bit about Liberace I think maybe he actually nailed the role. Douglas looks terrific and has some truly great scenes and certainly at least deserves his Emmy Nomination. However, I believe that Matt Damon takes the cake for best performance in this film. If its not completely certain than the last half of the movie proves how good he is. This might be one of Damon's best performances and he gives a disturbing and erratic performance as Liberace's lover Scott Thorson. Despite Scott Bakula seeming to get top credits in the film, his role is barely a cameo and there isn't anything special about the part. I was also very disappointed in the small role played by Dan Akroyd. He is in a few scenes and just looks bored and acts boring. What a disappointing turn from a talented and iconic actor. Debbie Reynolds plays Liberace's mother and does a decent job but the role is excruciatingly small (another example of something they could have focused more on.) I have seen more than enough Steven Soderbergh movies now to sort of understand him as a director. He really does enjoy telling a bloated story. From the atrocity of film-making that was Magic Mike, Solaris, and Haywire to brilliance like Erin Brockovich or Side Effects, he doesn't hold back in telling as much of a story as he wants to...whether it drags it down or not. He doesn't seem to have a very good handle on pacing when it comes to film. Behind the Candelabra ran at least twenty minutes too long and started to stumble in several places. Liberace fans and older movie goers might be more than turned away by the fact that this is strictly about his bizarre and dysfunctional gay relationship rather than what Liberace was or his career in any way. Still as I said in the title, this was a valiant effort, especially for Damon and Douglas and it was interesting to watch. I suppose it just wasn't entirely my thing but it falls somewhere in the mediocre range of Soderbergh's projects. 7/10",7,0,3,20 September 2013
Gone Girl," The first Oscar contender for me...a brilliantly made, mind bending thriller with a breakout role that will leave you mesmerized
","Yesterday, before I saw this film, if you had asked me to list my favourite directors I'm not sure if David Fincher would have been mentioned. I just wouldn't have thought of him. Then as the credits rolled on Gone Girl...I was just mesmerized by how brilliantly he crafts a thriller. The eccentricities of his characters and stories. Add in to that he has directed some of my favourite films including Se7en, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, The Game and The Social Network to name a few. The man has a style all his own and he draws you into the darkest of worlds and makes you believe every minute of it. Gone Girl is a slow paced, carefully executed mystery that I am absolutely certain will go into the annex of Hollywood history right up there with Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, Single White Female, Psycho...films about stalkers or psychotic individuals where a star has shone in their role by being completely and utterly, mouth dropping insane. There are lines delivered in this film and scenes experienced that will stay with me for years. I will go back and watch this movie to experience those scenes. I actually sat in the theatre recognizing that I was living what will be talked about as 'that classic scene.' Fincher truly has created a masterpiece...again. Gone Girl is this years Prisoners and it best get the accolades it deserves.Ben Affleck is getting an awful lot of press lately with his mainstream film career ahead of him as Batman. This role takes him back to basics and reminds us that he is talented for a whole other reason. He shows an intensity and a down to earth, very real quality that makes his character so damn easy to hate and love at the same time. Its a subtle performance compared to some of the more emotional ones in the film but he leads this cast very well and I think watching him again will only make you appreciate it more each time. If you look at Fincher's film history he does an incredible job at surrounding the main characters with incredible supporting characters. In this case you have stand out performances from Tyler Perry (maybe one of the best roles I've ever seen him in), Carrie Coon (supporting actress nod would not be out of the question), Kim Dickens (same for her), Patrick Fugit (lesser scale for him...found him a little underwhelming compared to everyone else), David Clennon and Lisa Banes. Dickens is particularly great in a very 'Fincher-esque' type role as a Police Detective who thinks she always one step ahead of Affleck. Also particularly terrific was Neil Patrick Harris in a dark and twisted role as a man completely obsessed with our lead girl and yet has no idea what he's in for when he goes up against her. Harris also has the honour of being a mainstay in one of those scenes mentioned earlier that will not soon be forgotten by anyone watching this. And finally we leave the best until last. We still have a lot of movie viewing ahead of us in 2014 but at this point if Rosamund Pike didn't walk away with the Best Actress award then the Oscars are a sham. Sweet innocent Pike who has always been sort of back drop in most movies is absolutely mind blowingly insane. She is jaw dropping in this performance and it gives me chills when I think about her dialogue delivery and certain scenes. She'd be the last actor I'd pick for this until I've seen her do it. This might be her masterpiece. She is evil and absolutely amazing. See this...FOR HER.Gone Girl is excruciatingly long for this type of film (much like Prisoners was last year.) It does even feel long at times considering you know that Fincher will end it when he's good and ready and even then he might not give you everything you want out of an ending. I was prepared for it. I only fault a film for being long if there isn't a distinct purpose behind it and I think every second of Gone Girl was necessary. We become so entranced with these characters that you want to see how every little detail unravels. I must admit (and I don't consider myself a genius in these matters) that I figured out the direction of the film very early on with just one clue. That didn't even remotely ruin the film for me because we then get to see how and why and where everything plays out. I don't often talk about musical score either because what do I know about music but again we have an Oscar winner Trent Reznor who worked with Finch before and his music is distinct and noticeable and haunting and sets a painstakingly created tone. Gone Girl definitely won't be for everyone. It is a critical darling sort of film but in my opinion it deserves it! A well acted and brilliantly crafted crime thriller. 9/10",9,4,19,8 October 2014
Django Unchained," Tarantino doing what Tarantino does best
","This is a film that I couldn't help go in with some high expectations. First of all, close friends told me how amazing it was. In fact some said it was one of the best movies they had ever seen. Critics have been raving and audiences have been bubbling and now awards all over the place. Django is a great film. Its a revenge western done the only way Tarantino does it, exploitative, insane violence with a 70's Grindhouse vibe. It fits the bill in every way. You can't say you didn't know what you were in for if you know Tarantino. Its well done and its entertaining and stylish in his style. I actually hoped this would be a huge ten for me because I do love Tarantino though I only discovered him in the last ten years or so. As good as it was, I had some issues. I hate saying a film is too long because I love every second I spend in a theatre but it was a massive three hours long. It could have easily been split into two in the same vein as Kill Bill was. That being said I give him kudos for not milking a film the way so many series are nowadays. Still I think with some better editing, the film could have been chopped ever so slightly and still kept its integrity. I found a certain issue with the plot as to why Django and the Doc went through such elaborate hoops to trick Candie instead of offering him a ridiculous amount to buy Django's wife. I know I'm not the only one bothered by this plot from the IMDb boards. And finally I felt like Jamie Foxx's lead performance of the title character lacked something. He didn't feel like the hero or anti-hero. He wasn't quite as bad-ass as I expected and with two or three really exceptional performances, Foxx felt less than stellar.Jamie Foxx plays Django. He's a former slave who has been beaten and mistreated. He is supposed to be dark and brooding and he is that but sometimes he plays it too much because he seems almost monotoned and almost boring. Yes he has some scenes where he really steps up and blows away his enemies but he doesn't really shine in his role and its too bad. Foxx is an amazing actor but I felt like he missed the opportunity to really impress. I wanted more Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name or something like that. Now for the absolutely amazing performances. Christoph Waltz is scene stealing. He is truly outstanding as the intelligent smooth talking Dr. King Schultz. He deserves his Oscar nod and proves once again in a Tarantino film how great he is at making his character come to life. I like Leonardo DiCaprio, you can't deny his outstanding career, but he truly blew me away in this film. He is just simply outstanding in his role as the quick talking businessman and pseudo villain Calvin Candie. This is easily one of the best roles I have ever seen him in. The scenes with him and Waltz are magic and some of the best chemistry I've seen on screen in a long time. Samuel L. Jackson, who does everything, actually really shines in this film. He is deliciously bad and you'll love to hate his maniacal and grouchy old Stephen. Combine the three of them and you'll have the three best characters in a 2012 film hands down. Kerry Washington is decent as Broomhilda. She fits her character well but never really impresses. She is just there to fill the plot point and she does that. The supporting cast are terrific too including some stand out performances from Don Johnson, Tom Wopat and M.C. Gainey.I knew as I watched the film that it was boiling up to an all out blood splattering revenge battle and it fulfilled that 120%. No one does blood splattering revenge like Tarantino. He certainly shows a lot of style in the film and the cinematography is well done. It shows from the typical western town to a southern plantation. Much has been said about the racist content of the film but it is a product of its time. That being said I don't think there is a lot of true history behind this story. I still don't feel that it showed racism in a positive light by any means and considering the black slave is the one who literally rips every single person apart in the end...I think he gets his vengeance. If you love Tarantino then you'll be pleased with Django Unchained. It is epic in every proportion and while not a perfect ten in my books, it certainly gets honourable mention at being stylish and entertaining through and through. 9/10",9,6,14,10 January 2013
Get Out," Fantastically unique but needed some fine tuning
","Now one thing is for certain this film deserves a lot of recognition. For one, it's the best horror film to come along in a very long time and it's a bit of departure from the new style of horror like Sinister, Insidious, The Conjuring etc. It hearkens more to the indie/international thrillers that I absolutely love. Isolated location, strange people, villagers of sorts...but the film has an obvious not so subtle political tone/message. It's really a creative story. It's even more impressive that this was written and directed by comedian Jordan Peele. This is a really cool extension for him. I also loved that he cast a lot of people who primarily are known for comedic type roles. It was really interesting watching a group of 'comedians' take this so deadly serious. My only issue with the film because it was so good and so well shot and so captivating that the social message is lost when the answer to it all is sort of 'well...just because.' I wanted like a super sick reason as to why this involved African Americans and it felt like Peele really copped out on the message they built. Still brilliant performances, a great build up and some solid scares make this a must see for horror fans.British actor Daniel Kaluuya leads the cast and does so expertly. He has a great back story and brings real depth to the role and his passion and his curiosity shines through. I don't think we felt like we got to know him well enough but he made for a great hero. Up and comer Allison Williams is fantastic as his girlfriend. She is so believable and has such an amazing opportunity to impress towards the end and she does that. Her and Kaluuya have great chemistry too which helps immensely. This cast really is fantastic and the supporting cast are as important as the main. Bradley Whitford is amazing as Williams' father, Catherine Keener is equally as impressive. The two of them together are absolutely phenomenal and their chemistry and performances could make this film a cult classic. Caleb Landry Jones, Marcus Henderson, Betty Gabriel (a haunting and terrifying portrayal), Lakeith Stanfield, Stephen Root and comic relief LilRel Howery are all literally great in their respective roles. It's not easy to get any comedy into such a dark story and Peele's script along with Howery's performance brings some perfectly dark comedy to a bleak script.The setting for the film is equally as important. The isolation of this lavish compound and the stark white of the landscape both people and the makeup of the home. The odd tone of the people and then the party unravelling, it's so great in every sense. This will truly put Peele on a whole new level of entertainment value and I hope he actually explores his newfound territory with horror/thriller because honestly to me this was better than any of his comedy but I know people are big fans. 8/10",8,5,18,27 February 2017
Aladdin," A genuine surprise and a great start to movie season!
","My expectations for this were relatively low. I was just wary they could pull this off in live action and the trailers didn't help those expectations. I, like many others, were very worried about Will Smith's genie who didn't look quite right. Any and ALL of my concerns melted away within minutes of the start of this film. Aladdin is a glorious, splashy spectacle and Will Smith was one of the best parts of the movie. He absolutely nails the role of genie and makes it his own but still pays a certain homage to the animated version. It was the first movie in a really really long time that made me remember Will Smith is a superstar. This was the perfect role for him. Additionally, Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott were magnificent both on their own and together. Their chemistry was perfect. In fact, the chemistry between all of the cast was so great which really helped the film. I've read a lot of positive reviews about the film and all of them seem to imply that Jafar was a weak point in the film but I actually though Marwan Kenzari was very good as Jafar. He was underused perhaps a little but he still played a very good villainous role and was the perfect adversary. Navid Negahban and Nasim Pedrad were also good in smaller roles. The music is amazing, all the original classics are in place and don't disappoint and some new music as well that is very good. I think they added a certain depth to Jasmine that really works well for today's audiences. Aladdin is the movie to beat this summer in my books. I loved it. It was very nearly a perfect experience and if I were to see it again, I think it might become a 10 for me. 9/10",9,21,49,27 May 2019
Insidious," Truly mind blowing, entertaining, horrifying movie going experience!! A gem in the genre!!
","I love finding a 10/10 film for me. Especially when you least expect it. I also love a good horror flick. Horror is probably my favourite genre. So I definitely go out of my way when I'm in the city to see the newest horror flicks and am I ever glad I caught Insidious because it turned out to be one of the best supernatural thrillers I have seen in a very very long time, possibly ever. Amazing, suspenseful, well acted, terrific twists and turns, emotional story, and just all out really creepy. Because I'm such a big horror fan it takes an awful lot to creep me out and Insidious got under my skin in all the right ways. One IMDb reviewer who also loved the film said he felt like a kid watching The Exorcist again and that is exactly dead on the money. This film could easily stand up next to The Exorcist and holds its own in any Ghost Story genre making Paranormal Activity look like child's play. Gripping and terrifying don't even seem to be strong enough words for the film. It mixes together the Haunted House factor, with demons, exorcisms, the imagery of Hell, and a twist to the story which is never easy to pull off that will really make you even more terrified.As far as I'm concerned this is the performance of Patrick Wilson's career. He is terrific as the doting father who begins to unravel the mystery about his son and about his own past. He has an intensity and a down to earth quality that will make you relate to him. Rose Byrne plays Wilson's wife and the mother of the young man haunted by this being. Byrne gives an intense and worthy performance and her and Wilson have terrific chemistry and together they will make you riveted to the screen for the entire story. Youngster Ty Simpkins is anything but a newcomer. He has had multiple roles in his young life and this proves he has the acting chops to continue. His performance in this film is well beyond his years and he gives a stirring and disturbing performance on par with Linda Blaire's Exorcist performance. Lin Shaye might be the one small stone in the shoe of this movie. Her character is vital, and could be a truly terrific part and she does okay and her and Wilson have good chemistry opposite each other. But there are times when I feel like Shaye is giving a bit of a campy performance and doesn't live up the rest of the impressive cast. Still she gives a valid performance and an important character.Saw patriarchs James Wan, Leigh Whannell write and direct the film and its no secret that these two guys work so well together and they know horror better than just about anyone else. I mean granted the Saw series is blood soaked and Insidious is more of a psychological disturbing film but both have great stories and has their fingerprints all over it. It's worth mentioning the great Easter Egg in the scene where Patrick Wilson is teaching his class and Leigh Whannell's name is on the blackboard below a picture of the Saw clown with an '8' underneath it. Either just a clever Easter Egg or a sign of another Saw instalment. However, Insidious makes the entire Saw series looking boring and contrived because this film is truly brilliant, fun, twisted, disturbing, and an absolute must see for horror/thriller fans!! Go see it NOW! 10/10",Null,4,6,25 September 2011
The Theory of Everything," A mind blowing performance and a fascinating film
","Every year I end up watching one or two 'critical darlings' that I likely wouldn't normally watch because of Awards season. I am trying to get ahead of the curve and see as many potential Oscar nominees before the nominations take place and since The Golden Globes were announced today, I decided to check this film out. I had fairly meager expectations given that I anticipated this to be a bit of a bore honestly. I was completely wrong. The film is emotionally charged, beautifully shot, fantastically acted and just a really amazing story about a man that everyone knows the name but how many of us know about him? As another reviewer pointed out, they made this film without hardly touching on the Science that Hawking is most known for but that serves to make this film easily enjoyable by just about anyone. This film is about Hawking's personal life, his relationship with his first wife and his heart wrenching physical deterioration with Lou Gehrig's Disease. In some ways its a simplistic film focusing on those certain details while likely avoiding others but it definitely gets the point across and ends up sitting with you long after the credits roll making this an impressive and very good film.The last time I saw Eddie Redmayne it was in the magnificent Les Miserables. However, I found him less than magnificent in that film. Honestly, I found him incredibly irritating so I wasn't looking forward to seeing him in this. Well I eat my words. Redmayne is magnificent. He is certain to get an Oscar nomination because he completely loses himself in this part and easily gives the best performance I have seen this year. It brought tears to my eyes more than once and you just ache for this man. He makes Hawking come to life on screen. Fellow Golden Globe Nominee Felicity Jones is high on my list of favorites. Yes, its true that much to my wife's chagrin I have an enormous crush on her and have ever since Chalet Girl. In the first part of the movie I was a little surprised she had gotten her nomination. It wasn't that she wasn't good in her role as Hawking's beloved first wife but she was just okay and really had to step up to match Redmayne's performance. However, when Hawking deteriorates physically Jones finds her footing and gives an excellent performance in the latter half. I'd still say it wasn't anywhere near Redmayne's but she is very good and their chemistry is excellent. David Thewlis is also very good in a supporting role as Hawking's mentor and friend. I must admit though I was a little surprised that the rest of the supporting cast is just okay and no one particularly stands out at all. In fact, a couple of the more significant characters feel clumsy and almost in the way of the overall story.Surprisingly so, James Marsh has had a lot of experience with documentaries and that rarely translates well into strong direction of a motion picture but he does this extremely well. Perhaps his experience in factual films helps make this feel so real. The true brilliance of The Theory of Everything is that you feel like you are right there with Jane and Stephen Hawking. You are experiencing their life. This is a first rate biography and as the story goes even Hawking himself was moved to tears watching this. The tone of the film is so sad and heart wrenching and yet you're inspired to watch on because Redmayne makes you believe and understand Hawking's brilliance to the world even if you know nothing about his theories and work. The film slowly changes direction and you begin to see things more from Jane's perspective (this being based on her book) and you get a different understanding of Hawking seeing him from her side of things. This isn't a film that everyone will enjoy but for a beautiful drama with a great story and a magnificent lead performance you can't go wrong. I look forward to seeing this film at the Oscars and see what else is out there that can rival it. 8.5/10",8,0,1,11 December 2014
2012," Yet again Emmerich defines the disaster in disaster movie
","Anyone remember when Roland Emmerich was a respected director for entertainment? He has taken epic to a new level and kept his films mainstream and enormously successful. Independence Day, The Patriot, 10,000 BC (I liked it) and now this. How could one possibly expect this film would come out a bigger disaster then the one it portrays? Early trailers had me drooling. Mayan prophecy, worldwide disaster, John Cusack, non-stop action...it was the one time I would go to the movies in the summer of 2009 and not have to wonder if the film would entertain. So imagine my shock when after the first half hour I had rolled my eyes more than eaten popcorn. Any disaster film, or sci-fi flick, or even most films require a suspension of belief but the true mark of a great film maker is to make you belief that you can suspend your belief. Think about it...Emmerich made us BELIEVE that Aliens could invade and that Will Smith could kick their ass, he made us BELIEVE that we were watching early man go through trials and tribulations in a world full of mastodons and beasts of all kinds. 2012...the only think I believed was that this film was a joke, and I wasted my ten bucks.John Cusack is a terrific actor. He has a screen presence like many aspire to have. He still has the same draw even amongst a horrendous plot. Even someone with any less charisma had been in this role...I probably would have walked out. Amanda Peet can also act. She's had good roles and most of her roles have been in comedy and yet here she is trying to make us believe she is on the run with her family to save her life during the end of the world. It just doesn't work. She isn't strong enough to lead the kind of intensity required for this role. However, her and Cusack have really good chemistry and a great romantic comedy would do them both wonders. Woody Harrelson gives a stand out cameo performance as the eccentric broadcaster Charlie Frost. He is perhaps the one exception to an otherwise shockingly and unfortunately bland cast. Harrelson fans can rest easy. Tom McCarthy gives a decent performance as Peet's new boyfriend and an adversary to Cusack at first before they bond over disaster. He is lucky to do a decent job because he doesn't have a lot of charisma and fortunately his character is a nice guy. The supporting cast is made up of some really talented actors in completely lifeless roles. Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Thandie Newton are some of the big names in the film. They're performances can't even be commented on because they are simply boring and never used.So much has been said about 2012's special effects. All of it is true. The special effects are mind blowing, breath taking, brilliant and this is practically the sole reason this film gets a 5 from me and not a big fat goose egg. The sheer setting of destruction in this film is amazing. I would rather have watched two hours of the world falling to pieces and nothing else than force silly characters into ridiculous situations. For one thing, Cusack's family (his two children, ex-wife and new boyfriend) are literally ALWAYS being followed just steps behind by the end of the world. Imagine that? Every disaster is always right behind them and they ALWAYS escape by milliseconds. One reviewer said it was hard to watch characters surviving through this in the most ridiculous manner and that is exactly true. Nail biting? No it is just silly. And the script is just as ludicrous. The one liners and inappropriate comedic moments, and then on top of that the so called 'serious dialogue' is ridiculous and will make you laugh when you should be on the edge of your seat. One of the last lines in the film is a transmission from someone who has discovered land. They say something to the effect of the disaster not being as widespread as they though. It wiped out 99% of the entire earth? That's pretty widespread. Sorry Mr. Emerich but your movie made me hope the end wasn't in 2012 but 2009...when this movie ended. 5/10",5,0,2,2 March 2010
The Number 23," Good not great, but still gives you a little fun idea to play with with some good performances....
","Thrillers are tough nowadays...we have seen almost everything and it's pretty common for most main stream thrillers to follow the typical path of the genre and not provide anything spectacularly new to it. I think that's where Shyamalan really took the world by storm because he managed to breath HUGE life into the genre and honestly I saw a little of that style in The Number 23. They even attempted, although a little forcefully and not really successfully to give us that Shyamalan/Sixth Sense ending but somehow fails to be as shocking or surprising. The idea behind The Number 23 is fantastic. A woman comes across a book which she passes onto her husband who seems a little bored with his life and suddenly becomes compulsively obsessed with the number 23 just like the character in the book. He begins to see how the number 23 affects him personally and takes him on a mysterious quest to find the writer and eventually thwart an decades old murder. They manage to captivate with that notion and also manage to show to us how the number 23 is integrated into our life and our science and our religions and mythologies (the whole 23 concept is not new to 'real' literature.) So the film works and the cast is good and they all work together with one particular performance standing out more than others.I have always known Jim Carrey was versatile. He has done some incredible work far beyond her bizarre face shifting comedy that made him famous. Unfortunately his other ventures haven't been nearly as successful which is too bad because he is good and very convincing in dramatic parts. The Number 23 is no different. He gives an awesome performance that far outshines that of his co-stars and really shows a man that sinks into insanity. I thought his performance rivaled that of similar roles like Nicholson's Shining, or Harrison Ford's What Lies Beneath. I think in time people will appreciate this film and his performance much more. His wife is played by Virginia Madsen who seems to always be a critical favorite. Honestly I've never been a big fan...not that I dislike her performances but always find her a little bland and this was no exception. Next to Carrey's brutally honest and emotional performance she seemed so downplayed and almost boring. They worked well together but she just didn't give much to the plot or story. Logan Lerman plays their son in a small but effective role and most of the time shows more emotion and ability than Madsen does and I'm sure this will do big things for his career. One of the truly great things about some members of the cast are the alternate roles they get to play as the novel plays out in Carrey's mind. Carrey himself plays the mysterious dark detective 'Fingerling', Lynn Collins does a great job playing three different roles in Carrey's fantasy, and Danny Huston plays a small almost unnecessary role but still he does alright.Overall it just felt like there was a lot that didn't need to be there. They took far too long to explain the ending. I understood after they revealed it in the first five minutes but yet the explanation continued for 15-20 minutes. I didn't mind the very final scenes, I thought it was 'just' and 'a decent ending.' As Carrey's character says himself 'it's not the perfect ending, but it's the right one' and that's very true. I personally would not have it ended in any other way and in some twisted way it's a good, happy ending. No matter how you feel about some of the minor issues with the film or maybe that it's just a little bland for a thriller you will leave the theater adding numbers in your head and thinking about the number 23 and I'm sure that was a big part of the film makers goal. Certainly Joel Schumacher is no stranger to film making both really bad, and really good but he has this way of rushing things and trying to piece together elements of what could be good too quickly. This film does fall victim to that a little bit. It's definitely not bad, and I think well worth seeing but it won't blow you away. It's just an okay movie. 7/10",7,1,2,4 March 2007
Ghost Rider," Ghost Rider better vanish into thin air!!
","I'm starting to think I better steer clear of Marvel films. The Hulk? Daredevil? Electra? Who keeps giving clearance for these films just because they made Spiderman? Ghost Rider is at very best a big special effects film and outside of that it is utter garbage. The story makes so little sense, and they completely toss their rules and legends for Ghost Rider out the window when they need to and the whole experience is just brutally bad!! The only thing that might make it tolerable is the unintentionally humorous scenes, Nicholas Cage (who actually turns in a pretty decent performance) and the special effects. The CGI is spot on, barely noticeable, and Ghost Rider himself is very cool, very faithful to the comic and a great character but it pretty much ends there full force. Let's ask some questions? How is it that the devil's Bounty Hunter is charged with hunting evil and saving innocents? Doesn't sound much like the devil to me? How is it that despite Johnny Blaze turning into Ghost Rider at night in the presence of evil that he gets jumped in his apartment, at night, by an evil guy, and then beat senseless but never turns? How is it that nothing kills the element demons except Ghost Rider's chain that he picked up in the train yard? And when Johnny Blaze meets the Caretaker who can tell him everything about being the Ghost Rider and Johnny never once asks him how he knows? Seem like little details? It's not...it kills the entire film. It's complete utter nonsense that makes no sense.Now I thought the one thing that might get me in the film would be Nicholas Cage. It's not that I don't like Cage per se, I just find his ego a little big on screen and it carries into his performances so imagine my shock when I came out thinking he wasn't the issue at all and in fact made the film watchable. His Johnny Blaze was perfect, spot on, it was turbulent and torn and traumatized and he attempts to romance his teenage sweetheart and Cage is almost adorable as Blaze. He does a great job. Peter Fonda puts in a very monotoned and almost boring performance as the devil. He never comes across as much of an adversary or evil...he's just there. The special effects try and make him evil but even that doesn't work. Eva Mendes is Johnny's sweetheart and reporter Roxanne. Mendes is stunning, hot even and she does alright in the role but if I have ever seen anyone completely used in a film Mendes is that. Her breasts are hanging out of every shirt she wears and the camera almost zooms on them unapologetically. Teenage boys probably made up 40 million of the 43 million this movie made coming to see it more than once. Now Gibson Nolte makes a decent adversary as the son of the devil wanting to bring about hell on earth by possessing himself with a thousand of the evil-est spirits ever. Unfortunately they wrote his part as campy and corny and he never really gets to be evil and then he gets shot a bunch of times with a shotgun (probably a magical one) and then Ghost Rider uses his death stare to kill him...yawwwwwwwn...oh excuse me...Two performances I thought were really stand out were that of young Johnny Blaze and young Roxanne. I think I might have rather seen them in the lead roles than Cage and Mendes just for the sake of having no-names which can leave ego's in check. Matt Long has the right edge and emotion and maturity to play the role and he makes the first 20 minutes of the film watchable. Raquel Alessi is beautiful as young Roxanne and the two of them have a spark that Cage and Mendes just don't have.So there you have it...anything worth seeing in Ghost Rider you can rent the DVD and watch on fast forward so you don't waste too much time with this tank. Despite how much money it's made I cannot believe it will take top spot again this week because unless you're an enormous Ghost Rider fan and perhaps a die hard know it all about his legend...and even then you'll likely be offended...this one is off the charts bad, bad, bad. I only score it a 3 because it was tolerable to watch thanks to those few points I mentioned...and my Popcorn was good...mmmm popcorn. 3/10",3,1,4,25 February 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Good...but very different...the evolution of the X-men is at hand
","Perhaps the exit of Bryan Singer made a bigger impact than people realize on the enormously successful, and justifiably so, X-Men Series. Brett Ratner attempts to pick up the story so carefully woven together by Singer and he does a decent enough job but I think he also managed to completely dismantle Singer's creation and start a new evolution of X-Men. Besides this being turned into a Storm and Wolverine extravaganza, he successfully kills off three of the main characters from the first two films and the X-Men in general, introduce practically an entirely new team. None of this is bad or good, just different and interesting. The story does continue and the war that has been brewing between the humans and mutants and Magneto and the X-Men comes to a boiling point and breaks out on Alcatraz Island.Hugh Jackson, who since the first film has become a big star, returns as Wolverine. His sharp edged wit, and bad attitude have been toned down to almost the point of domestication and his Savior relationship with Rogue (Anna Paquin) is now non-existent. The entire character was just different in this one as was all the old cast members. They felt like old news and there wasn't the magic that they once had. Still Jackman fits the role flawlessly and he is a great star. Halle Berry is now a front runner in the cast (refusing to return if she wasn't) as Storm. Her character has changed a lot too. She really isn't the Storm from the first two films and I think ultimately she did even less even if she had more screen time. Anna Paquin returns as well for a small almost insignificant role as Rogue. She is there mostly to continue the debate on whether or not Mutants would be better off as normal humans. Two exceptions to the rule about the old cast members being old news were Famke Janssen, and Ian McKellen. Janseen, who was killed off at the end of X2 returns as Phoenix, an alter ego who uses her power to hurt anyone in her way. Janssen gets to release her wooden performance as Jean Grey and really let loose and that's good!! It was fun to see her on the other side of things and finally get closure to her story line. McKellen...what can you say about him...his performance as Magneto is brilliant. Angry, evil, powerful, yet you feel sorry for him, you see caring and fear. For the record at 66 years old he now has TWO movies in the last two weeks with a grand total of approximately 400 million dollars world wide!! Impressive!! McKellen comes full circle with Magneto and really uses his powers a lot. He is at the head of one side of the war and he is a powerful adversary. No one could do this role better. Rebecca Romijn, and James Marsden both return briefly in smaller roles which is unfortunate. Marsden I think has got a bum rap from day one in this series as Cyclops. He should have always had a bigger role and was good in his role. He was barely existent in this installment. Romijn's excellent, sexy villain Mystique has always been great and in the second one she had an even bigger role but she is quickly neutralized in this one. Patrick Stewart also returns as Charles Xavier and no one could do better than him either. Him and McKellen have a great chemistry and he is a fantastic leader. He always seems to become indisposed in some way though in every film. All these changes...mutations to the story if you will...are all to make way for the new breed of mutants. Kelsey Grammar takes the lead of the new group as The Beast. Diplomat, and as it turns out great fighter. Grammar is well cast and looks fantastic in his blue get up. When he finally starts to fight...well it's just damn cool. Shawn Ashmore gets a much bigger role as The Iceman. He's almost the biggest hero in the film at this point. Ashmore is one worth watching because I think he's got a big career ahead of him and his character is great. Aaron Stanford is Iceman's former friend and his opposite...Pyro. Their building conflict comes head to head finally in a one on one battle worth seeing. Vinnie Jones is a good addition as Juggernaut. I don't mean to take anything away from his performance but that character seems almost too forced onto the story, like they had to add him. Ben Foster, Ellen Page, Daniel Cudmore, all play new mutants with smaller roles in this sequel.If nothing else X-Men: The Last Stand doesn't need any more cast additions. They could easily make new films on these new characters because they've successfully weaned out the old ones or killed them off. Like the rest of the series the story is so vitally important and Ratner definitely doesn't take that for granted. But like the second sequel the action is significantly lower than what the original offered. It almost felt slow at times despite how good the story is. Perhaps there was just too many characters?? Nonetheless the last half hour or more of the film when the final war (The Last Stand) takes place is just awesome, a battle worthy of a final showdown. It felt epic, it looked epic, it was blockbuster material!! The one great thing about the series is it has definitely not gotten worse...it doesn't overly improve but it builds on itself and stays consistent even through a change of director. I hope there is more to come in this series or with the spin offs because they are absolutely a unique and interesting take on the action/Superhero genre. If you love that genre, you must see the X-Men trilogy!! 8/10",8,0,0,28 May 2006
Hellboy," One of Marvel's more crowning achievements and shows why they can be great
","Marvel has provided us with some real stinkers...Ghost Rider, Daredevil, and the less than great Ang Lee's Hulk, Fantastic 4, and Spiderman 3 but for every dud they show why we should continue to allow them to bring their super heroes to life and Hellboy is the perfect example. I am a solid DC fan and I have been all my life but I won't deny that Marvel has the most impressive and unique dark characters in the comic book world and Hellboy is the pinnacle of it. This could have been a very hard film to create and would take some incredible talent and vision and imagination to properly bring something as unique and visually odd as Hellboy and they nailed this home!! This is one of the most visually stunning, well made action thrillers chock full of unique creatures and stunning special effects out there. It's action but it's sci-fi fantasy as it's very best and the action really never stops and yet it easily rolls out the characters and makes you feel them and care about them and that is kudos to not only the film makers and writers but the terrific cast as well. You might think Director Guillermo del Toro would be the first choice to direct an action super hero film and yet his vision and imagination were absolutely perfect for what Hellboy needed to be.Ron Perlman has always been a great character actor but he scores a home run as the tough as nails, sensitive, wise cracking Hellboy. Underneath that enormous costume he creates Hellboy and makes it his own and he is amazing at it!! Hellboy couldn't be the same without him. Selma Blair, who I am not always a fan of, really is terrific as Firestarter Liz Sherman and the object of Hellboy's crush. They have amazing chemistry together for a monster and a woman (Beauty and The Beast anyone?) and she is a terrific character with a back story worthy of exploring in future installments and shows a lot of emotion. David Hyde Pierce as the voice and Doug Jones as Abe Sapien are brilliant. Pierce's voice is so ideal for the blue brilliant creature. He is the ideal sidekick to Hellboy. I hope we see more of him in the future installment. Karel Roden is downright disturbing as Hellboy's nemesis Rasputin and Ladislav Beran is one of the greatest villains in film history as the blade wheeling silent but deadly Nazi killer Kroenen. Rupert Evans and John Hurt round out the main supporting cast and both are very good in their smaller but pivotal roles.If nothing else Hellboy is stunning to watch. The setting from the exotic looking library, to the dark, gritty underground tunnels to the white wastelands of Russia and the monsters they encounter are just amazingly done and perfectly written into the story. While I am sure a lot of special effects and CGI were used in the film you would hardly know it. The special effects are brilliantly used and even the most outlandish battles between Hellboy and the creatures look absolutely stunning. I would be surprised if they were able to replicate the real brilliance of this film in the new sequel being released next week although the original cast and the original director are returning and the creatures look almost as amazing. If you haven't seen this original film you must see it now especially if you love action flicks or fantasy or just want a really good time then you won't be disappointed with Hellboy. 9/10",9,3,4,3 July 2008
P.S. I Love You," Critics strike out with me again...PS I Love You is a romance to write home about
","I wanted to see PS I Love You and I knew my girlfriend would love it too. The critics scathing reviews immediately scared me although I try not to listen but it seemed that they were pretty certain it was a dud and the few people I spoke to that had seen it seemed to agree. So it was with caution and perhaps low expectations that we went to see it and I am so glad I once again ignored their bad comments. PS I Love You is a very down to business, cute romance with a beautiful story, touching moments and YES it actually brought some tears to my eyes...just once...briefly...and it's really something for a film to do that for me. Certainly the film is not your traditional love story because the main characters' romance begins with one of them dying. But the film makers still weave this beautiful, touching story with some great performances and a new romance blooming in the background without ever infringing or depreciating the original romance. In some ways it could be described as a little shallow and without a lot of content but it's meant to make you feel good in a very dark comedy kind of way. They poke fun at death a little bit and come out with some seemingly crude off color humor but it fits into the story just perfectly.Multiple Academy Award Winner Hilary Swank plays Holly Kennedy, the happily married, financially struggling wife who finds herself a widow before too long. Devastated and depressed she finds herself on an obscure adventure set up by her husband before he died. It's really a self discovering trip and Swank has a certain likability and it works really well for this film because she carries a lot of the story and the romance single handedly. She does very well. Gerard Butler is handsome and adorable as her husband Gerry. Butler and Swank do have terrific chemistry which is absolutely pertinent for this type of film obviously. Butler does a lot of voice work and his deep masculine voice works well for the film. The supporting cast around the couple is really the soul of this film because even though their parts are small they all work really well together and they are a terrific ensemble cast. Lisa Kudrow, Gina Gershon, James Marsters (so cool to see him on the big screen---been a big fan since Buffy days) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is terrific and equally as great a presence as Butler is. Honestly I could have done without Harry Connick Jr. as Swank's first love interest. I thought he was kind of goofy and out of place in the film although he redeems himself a little later on in the film. And finally an honorable mention to the incomparable Kathy Bates as Swank's mother. She has her own little back story and she is really terrific and just ups the ante of the cast immediately. I wish she'd do more on screen!! The film jumps around from flash backs (including some beautiful Irish scenery), to voice over letter reading to karaoke scenes, fishing, and some very good physical comedy. The one liners and some of the comedy is a little dark and you almost wonder if you should be laughing at it but they deal with love and death in a very open and unhindered way and its very refreshing and a different approach to the romance genre. The cast is great and the romance is well dealt with and considering how they set up this intense and passionate romance between Butler and Swank they still make you enjoy her new romance in the horizon and not feel any animosity for her moving on. I also have to give them HUGE kudos to the ending because I was thoroughly disappointed with what I thought the ending would be and they completely surprised me and I loved it. So ignore all the harsh critics and enjoy this really cute and fun and a little dark date movie that anyone can have fun with. And if you're wondering when my eyes welled up it was the scene when she doing Karaoke and everyone else faded away and her husband was sitting there listening to her...got me...right here. Go see it. 8.5/10",8,1,5,8 January 2008
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Sweet, funny, touching...everything I wanted it to be...almost.
","In my younger years when I was a veracious reader I stumbled upon The Secret Life of Walter Mitty and absolutely loved it. I have never seen the original film (though I plan to soon) and I wasn't too concerned whether or not this film would follow the story closely (which it doesn't.) Anyone looking for an adaptation of the original short story...just cancel it right out of your mind because this isn't it. This is more of a remake of the original film that holds some of the character, morals and ideas of the short story. From the moment I saw the trailer I was excited. I saw this as potentially another Forrest Gump (one of the greatest films ever made in my book.) In many ways it absolutely has some of that great style and feel that made Forrest Gump great and that is a huge compliment. My expectations for this were quite high and I left the theatre not disappointed at all. It was absolutely a feel good film that had many things to ponder about life and risk. It was definitely a comedy with some decent laughs but had a lot of heart as well. Was it perfect? No. It starts out a little slow and some of the imagination scenes felt just a little bit forced but one thing is for certain the stunning, jaw dropping scenery and cinematography in this film is a ten easy. Its simply beautiful to watch.Ben Stiller takes double duty as director and star and bravo to him on both counts. I like Stiller but especially when he does stuff like this and leaves the stupid Zoolander type characters and comedy at home. This was the perfect role for him as the assuming, quiet Walter Mitty who opens himself up to the world for the first time. He is terrific on screen and he outdoes himself as director so kudos to him. Kristen Wiig is good if not just a little understated as the object of Mitty's affections. However, this is a great role for her compared to the stupid SNL type comedy she's done in recent years. She is actually a very good serious actor and her and Stiller have great chemistry. Her character is just a little bit underdeveloped and doesn't get enough scenes to truly shine but she does well. Sean Penn (someone I have a love hate relationship with because he often picks incredible movies but I find him pompous and irritating) has a small appropriate and well done role as photographer and adventurer Sean O'Connell. He is actually the perfect fit for the mostly mysterious role and is quite good in it. Probably one of the best roles he's had in some time. The supporting cast are all good...though no one is really great. Shirley Maclaine should have been better and perhaps worked into the story more as Mitty's Mom and Adam Scott was perfectly pompous and evil as Mitty's new boss and they had great chemistry against each other.Despite the story's minor short comings it is a beautiful film and one for nearly everyone. I can't tell you enough how stunning the scenery is from Greenland to Iceland and even the streets of New York City are just perfectly used and each scene has something to look at from the dark shadows of Mitty's office to the towers Afghan mountains. When I see this again on video (which I certainly will!) I have a feeling it will lose just a little something not seeing it on the big screen because there is a distinctive jaw dropping quality about some of the scenes (him skateboarding through the countryside, the mountain climbing and so much more.) I actually found the imagination scenes almost too distracting but it was necessary to demonstrate Mitty's desire to escape. This didn't really have to be Walter Mitty...they could have made it a whole new concept but that's hindsight now and it is what it is. The film is actually a lot funnier than what I expected but they don't let the comedy interfere with the true heart behind this story. An absolutely worthy entertaining film that you should see!! 8.5/10",8,4,7,3 January 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Suffers from the middle child syndrome of the trilogy but still a must see!!
","I feel almost bad giving this film any sort of flack after reading other people's reviews because people truly are very passionate about this film. After re-watching Fellowship of The Ring and truly being enchanted by it I anxiously watched The Two Towers and it just didn't quite captivate me the way that Fellowship did. Many trilogies stumble during their second installment because it's almost a necessary drawl between the first and the third...beginning and end and you have to fill in all the important information to join the two. Certainly the climax of The Two Towers is very important and that's the battle of Helm's Deep and that is really what The Two Towers is all about and it just continually builds up to that and it drags while it's getting there. The characters don't give near the same effort to the expanding story and the action is minimal compared to the original. Yes it has the epic Helm's Deep Battle but it's just a different all around feel to it. Much has changed and there is a lot going on but it's almost too much. I mean The Two Towers spans a lot of information from the book (no I have never read them) so it does have big shoes to fill and I respect that but I just didn't get the same epic feel from it.The entire cast returns for the second and adds some new faces as well, including one of the most infamous movie characters of all time. I won't spend too much time on the original cast because I did that for Fellowship but they all do a good job. However it feels like they've lost a little something with this second installment. Part of this may be because some of the characters change so dramatically. Elijah Wood's Frodo Baggins goes through an intense change as the ring begins to catch hold of him and almost turns him. Wood's performance is a little more subtle than Fellowship but still very good. Also Sir Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf having fallen through the earth and returned as Gandalf the White. This new version is less emotional and a little more rough around the edges and I miss the old Gandalf and it really took something away from the character for me because McKellen was amazing in the original. The addition of one of the most famous movie characters is that of computer generated Gollum based on the expressions of movements of Andy Serkis, a very talented character actor (also contributed his movements to King Kong.) I personally found Gollum annoying and overused to the likes of Jar Jar Binks and felt more the same way about him that Sam did in the film. Bernard Hill is good as the determined and concerned King Theoden, and Miranda Otto is alright as Eowyn, the niece of the King but I have my issues with her storyline. The addition of Treebeard and the Trees of the forest was also a very cool addition and I love their part in the story.One of the most annoying and frustrating aspects for me in The Two Towers is this strange and completely unnecessary pseudo-romance that is established between Aragorn and Eowyn. They spent so much time making us feel the incredible, life altering love between Aragorn and Arwen in The Fellowship and it only infuriates the movie watcher to see him contemplating love with someone else although he never acts on it. It seems to diminish the power of their romance. For the SMALL minority that do find The Lord Of The Rings films 'boring,' it's almost understandable with The Two Towers. I mean don't get me wrong, it still has it's breath taking moments and the special effects and the direction and cinematography is brilliant but it moves at a much slower pace and takes much longer to fill in all these gaps that are required to get The Fellowship to The Return of The King. So you can't not watch The Two Towers and it is a must see for it's value but it isn't the best in the series by a long shot. 7/10",7,0,2,16 September 2007
Schindler's List," The most moving, exceptional film ever made!!
","I had no expectations going into this movie.  I had heard different opinions about it and I was pleasantly blown away by it.  It left me in tears which few movies ever truly do.  I honestly believe this to be one of the top ten greatest films of all time...not necessarily because of it's watchability but because of it's content and the way it is filmed. Liam Neeson (Who I have never been fond of) plays Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who is a brilliant business man, con artist, and German personality.  He loves his ladies and his booze but is also quite humane right from the very beginning.  When the Germans invade Poland and begin to send Jews into Ghetto's he opens a factory making cookware (pots and pans) using the jews as labor.  However, it isn't cruel labor but rather he is giving them a purpose and treats them as equal workers giving them benefits and good working conditions...to him...he's just making his money.  He is very humble about everything and does not see why the Jews are so happy with him.  As the movie continues we see the honest progression of the war and the hatred towards the Jews.  The rumours of the gas chamber begin to circulate, and we watch as Almon Goeth played chillingly by Ralph Fiennes (another actor I have never been overly fond of) murders Jews at will keeping the other Jews in check by fear.  Goeth is a power hungry, Nazi who thrives on seeing people suffer by his hand.  He's been given a high powered rank and milks it for all it's worth and enjoys it.  He snipers Jews from his window...just for sport.  He's empty and pure evil.  When Schindler happens to oversee a Ghetto raid by the SS he is moved to tears as he watches his workers being brutalized.  As he makes his millions he wields his own more subtle power with bribes, women, food, wine, reputation in order to progress his business and save his workers. He then takes a quite signifigant more direct role by actually buying off top ranking Nazi officials in order to 'buy' Jewish workers...the workers and their families who worked for him in his cookware plant.  He begins to make a list of 1100 Jewish people he wants bought and brought by train to his new Munitions plant where they are to make shell casings for bombs.  A very intense scene takes place when the Jewish women he 'purchased' are re-routed to the wrong place because of an error in paper work.  They think that this is it for them and the gas chamber will be their destination but the error is fixed and the women arrive unharmed to Schindler's Plant.  In the most moving scene in movie history...Schindler breaks down before escaping Allied forces at the end of the war and realizes how many had died outside his factory and how many he wished he could have saved.  Liam Neeson performance in this entire movie but especially in that scene will haunt me forever.  This film is never to be tossed on a back shelf...it is so much more than a classic...it's brilliance.  I don't, however, necessarily take it as historical fact when it comes to Schindler. In reading on him I don't see him quite as the beloved character you feel in the movie.  He seemed more selfish and perhaps less humble in real life...but nonetheless the man saved 1100 and then some Jews and that to me makes him a hero no matter what.  This movie though is one no one can ever miss.  It's a triumph!!! 10/10",Null,12,18,15 June 2002
Across the Universe," An honestly beautiful love story told in the strangest of ways...an acquired taste with some downfalls
","Across The Universe immediately appealed to me. First of all it looked totally out there...strange and bazaar, unique and unlike anything else. And it was ultimately a musical with the music of one of the greatest groups in history, The Beatles. I am, and always have been an enormous Beatles fan so I thought I had to see this. Now Across The Universe definitely fits the bill for being unique and different and fulfilled everything you might expect from it. It really had some stunning visuals and beautiful choreography and a really decent story to it as well. But the story is perhaps where it stumbles slightly. The film starts out absolutely fantastic, just literally sucks you in with the story of this young man going to America to fulfill his dreams, falls in love, finds a best friend and is living life to the fullest. They use all the best and most well known Beatles' songs and make you sway to the music and really get involved and then after about 45 minutes into the film everything....begins....to....slow....down. The film clocks in at an astounding and very long in the tooth 2 hours and 15 minutes and it's simply not necessary which is unfortunate. Musicals do tend to be longer than most but Across The Universe could have easily cut itself down to an hour and a half give or take. Still the characters redeem the slow pace in the middle and the end makes up for it and during that time you will find yourself mesmerized with the unique style of the film.The very talented Jim Sturgess headlines the cast as free spirited Jude. Sturgess definitely gives us a character that you can really fall into and get involved and feel his emotions. Sturgess makes the film very worthwhile in all it's awkward stages and he is a star!! Evan Rachel Wood is the lovely and outspoken Lucy. She does a really terrific job and has a very pretty voice and a very girl next door look. She also plays the sixties protester very well and her characters goes through a lot of changes. Most importantly her and Sturgess make a dynamic couple and make for a really great love story. Also keep your eye on Joe Anderson who plays free spirited, smart talking Max. He doesn't have as big a role as some of the others but he still is a really great performer and really captures your attention on screen with his unique look. He also got sing one of my favorite songs in the world...'Hey Jude.' Supporting cast including Dana Fuchs, Martin Luther, and T.V. Carpio do a really decent job although I would like to say that I believe Carpio's role as Prudence, the closet lesbian that breaks out into spontaneous song was completely forced into the story and had no real purpose at all other than to just be there.There lies part of the problem with Across The Universe. Unlike a truly great musical parts of the film felt really forced, like they had to fight to get certain Beatles songs into the story...such as 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand,' which was a beautifully done song but pointless to the story. If they realized this and removed some of that overkill (although I love some of the songs they used) they could have made a shorter and more effective and brilliant film. Director Julie Taymor is certainly no new face to directing musicals having already won Tony Awards. Perhaps this musical didn't translate to screen as well as it may have on stage but she made a beautiful love story and the cast really do a terrific job. It's just a little long and definitely way out there which some might really enjoy. Certainly there is nothing wrong with being unique. It was also really cool to see cameos by infamous rockers Bono, and Joe Cocker (I knew that was Cocker as soon as he started to sing.) Across The Universe is definitely something to see to experience something unique and moving and if you love Beatles music then you'll be completely enamored. See it for yourself!! P.S. To the many reviewers and posters who feel it necessary that you have to be on drugs in order to enjoy this, and insist on blathering on about their obvious drug addictions...you're wasting your lives and hurting those around you.

The Incredibles," Possibly one of the greatest feats of Animation ever...revolutionary!!
","I finally got around to seeing The Incredibles which was exactly that!! Pixar has already struck gold long before The Incredibles came along but they continue to revolutionize animation making it a whole new genre that rakes in the cash and for good reason. Pixar and other recent animated features have managed to create films that kids adore but adults also love seeing and The Incredibles is the pinnacle of that conglomeration. The Incredibles storyline could have been a live action film that adults would have loved, the story, script and premise were as live action and real as it gets but instead it was animated in brilliant CGI that is stunning at times. I have to immediately point out how amazing t he water and fire effects were and I don't even have a high definition television and I was amazed by that effect alone. The story unfolds at a very nice pace without rushing to the action or funny scenes and never tries to hurry through anything. We are introduced to Bob, and Helen in their younger Heroic days and then we see them fifteen years later as the regular every day citizens trying to deal with the fact that they have super powers that they can't use to help people anymore.The casting for the Incredibles is truly perfection. I've always said it's hard to judge an actor by their voice work mostly because I haven't done a lot of reviewing for animated films but The Incredibles truly captured some talented voice work. Craig T. Nelson IS Mr. Incredible and his alter ego Bob Parr. His entire performance just embodies the character and makes him come to life. His subtle voice changes and reactions and everything is just wonderful!! Holly Hunter is wife Helen Parr and also Elastigirl. She has such a distinct voice and it just melds so well with her character. I am amazed at both Nelson and Hunter's voice over work in this film. They are great together and make such incredible characters. Samuel L. Jackson to a lesser extent plays cool as ice Frozone and his alter ego Lucius Best. Jackson is terrific and his voice is distinct but completely takes over the character. I would love if either Lucius or Frozone played a bigger part in the film because Jackson is great. His voice takes new tones that I wouldn't normally associate to Jackson. Jason Lee is terrifically evil as Syndrome and Buddy Pine. He's horrible and malicious and one of the best villains in an animated film I have ever seen!! Spencer Fox and Sarah Vowell also do a great job as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's children each having their own unique powers that are utilized throughout the film.I can't say exactly how much I enjoyed this film. It's probably one of my favorite cartoons hands down!! The story was brilliant and so not typical of an animated film. It held nothing back with big explosions, dangerous situations, and some very harrowing moments considering young children would be watching it. I think film makers are realizing that children aren't as fragile as initially thought with mature films like Harry Potter, Pirates of The Caribbean making huge splashes with the youngsters. And this is good because it means adults don't have to 'sit through' a kid's flick but rather enjoy it as much if not MORE than the kids. The Incredibles is a riveting action flick with drama, tons of laughter and edge of your seat moments. The Incredibles is a must own and a must see classic for you and your kiddies. 10/10",10,1,2,10 July 2006
The Mist," A drop dead amazing adaptation and one of the best films of the year
","In an absolutely astounding year at the theaters with some incredible 9 outta 10's and 10 outta tens out there it's great to still see some incredible movies coming during the typically slow time. Even if they aren't cleaning up at the box office they shouldn't be ignored. I had really high expectations for this film adaptation of one of my favorite Stephen King novellas. I suppose that if anyone could do the story justice director and writer Frank Darabont would be able to do it having previously adapted two very successful King films. It has been some time, more than a year or two since reading the short story so I had the benefit of not being overly influenced by the book. The Mist was shocking, twisted, depraved, haunting, beautifully filmed and one of the best action drama, sci-fi horrors of the year hands down with some truly incredible special effects the likes which haven't impressed me this much since my first viewing of Jurassic Park. The acting was spot on even if it was almost campy and overdone it just fit the film. This was Stephen King movie-dom at it's very best. The eerie isolation, the small town, the close knit neighbors and the religious fanaticism. And the fact that Darabont wrote a completely new ending that is downright disturbing and twisted and even King himself heralded as terrific makes it all the more worthwhile.Thomas Jane (who I have always thought has an amazing performance in him) does a terrific job as the rugged alpha male hero of The Mist. He is the perfect Stephen King leading man...flawed but yet perfectly heroic in every way. Jane commands the screen and his performance draws you in to the very last moment. In a perfect world he would deserve an Oscar Nomination (even though it'll never happen.) When I first saw Marcia Gay Harden stumble onto screen in a very vivid and lively religiously fanatical performance I thought 'Oh man, she is overdoing it a lot' but then as the story unfolded and her character came out more I realized that this was Mrs. Carmody, her character. Overdone, fanatical, loud, sanctimonious and dangerous. It turns out Harden gives on hell of a performance and may indeed deservingly so get an Oscar nomination because she is the perfect anti-villain and is amazing. She is the perfect 'in-the-flesh' adversary for Jane's David Drayton. Laurie Holden is also very good as the female heroine. She's strong and gutsy and still looks good and plays her part very well. To me these were the stand out performances and I wish I could go through each person because there were some really terrific supporting cast members including Jeffrey DeMunn, Toby Jones, and more. If anything The Mist is a sure fire nomination for Best Ensemble Cast.There isn't a single moment of lag in this film which clocks in at a deliciously perfect 2 1/2 hours and doesn't try to cut anything out to save time. Just when you think the climax must be over the ending completely blows you away as the desperately try to flee The Mist. In one of the most stunning displays of special effects and jaw dropping movie moments you get to see the Beast that lies in the mist and it is AMAZING!! The film moves at break neck speed and I haven't found myself whispering at the screen this much in a long time 'Look Out' 'Oh my gosh' and so forth. This is just a truly breath taking film and unfortunately it won't likely get it's just rewards or even make a lot of money but I have to encourage any King fans, Horror/Sci-fi fans or just anyone looking for a truly great film experience...you must see this. It's one of the best this year hands down and period. 10/10",10,2,5,11 December 2007
Stardust," A well meant fairy tale with really good romance and adventure but has some moments of frustration
","Stardust is not alone in the absolute slew of magical fairy tale adventures to hit the screen in 2007 although it stands alone this summer with the exception of Harry Potter. Still I have to wonder if audiences really want all this fantasy and magic? Stardust to date hasn't fared well in the theater but I went to see it with reasonably decent expectations and the first hour I was a little disappointed. The film is much longer than it needs to be, in fact, it almost feels like it forces itself to be 2 1/2 hours just to fit the fantasy epic genre. The problem with Stardust is very simple. It has far too much misguided and misplaced humor. It makes itself into a fantasy/comedy and it doesn't need to be like that. The humor and self mocking ruins the film rather than assists it in any manner. Fortunately by the time the first hour is past the rest of the film redeems itself in a huge way with an amazing adventure, beautiful romance, a touching story, and a feel good Fairy Tale with the happy ending in tact. Director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn has never done anything like this only previously directing Layer Cake and involving himself in British cult classics like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. So his attempt and experience at a subtle dry humor just doesn't transition over the Stardust very well but fortunately Fairy Tale wins out.Certainly an all star cast brings this film into high regard with Sir Ian McKellen narrating the story. Charlie Cox plays our young hero/Prince Tristan. He goes through a very big metamorphosis throughout the film and I couldn't see him as the hero in the beginning (which I think was the point) but by the end he is the handsome and swashbuckling Prince you'd expect. He does a terrific job and delivers a strong performance while being very easy to relate to. Lovely Claire Danes returns to the big screen for the first time in two years as the fallen star Yvaine. I had figure Yvaine would be portrayed as a quiet, lovely, naive girl but much to my surprise she is a firecracker. Sarcastic, and strong and a fighter and a much more interesting character than I thought she'd be. It makes the romance between Cox and Danes much more interesting and it is really a beautiful romance with some truly inspiring moments of heartfelt honesty. Michelle Pfeiffer is the evil witch (one of three) who sets out to capture Danes in order to capture eternal beauty by eating her heart. Pfeiffer is appropriately 'witch-like' but unfortunately her character gets saddled with a lot of the misplaced humor I mentioned. She's almost campy at times but the final battle does make her as wicked as witches come and she looks incredible (out of make up that is.) And finally I must mention one of my favorite actors Mr. Robert De Niro who I admit I respect in almost anything he does but this performance makes Stardust worth while. De Niro plays...ahem...flamboyant but closeted Captain Shakespeare. Supposedly the meanest pirate of the air ship in the sky but as it turns out he simply wants to keep his reputation while living his secret life behind closed doors. Watching De Niro prance around in a dress is priceless and it's not that it's mocking homosexuality, in fact, his character has an important moral about being yourself and he is a hit of the film. He's a great character!! Add in supporting performances by Peter O'Toole, Sienna Miller, Nathaniel Parker, and Mark Strong as a deliciously evil Prince bent on capturing a stone around Yvaine's neck that will make him King. Everyone has a great role and does a great job despite the sometimes campy humor and dialog.Stardust manages to hold a little bit of adult aura to it while still being reasonably acceptable for children and comparisons to The Princess Bride are not unfounded at all. In fact Stardust may actually stand the test of time and become a bigger hit down the road on DVD or as a cult classic because it does have moments of true heart and I wasn't disappointed in any way. I just wish there had been less of that humor because it wasn't entirely necessary although the plot point of the 'dead Prince brothers' watching over the remaining brother(s) was very funny and did add smiles to the already cute story. Most of all Stardust has a terrific romance and adventure spanning a magical world and it's worth checking out. 7.5/10",7,6,9,25 August 2007
I Am Legend," Controversial and intense but no matter what you think of the film...Will Smith delivers a powerhouse performance
","The reason to see this film is very simple...one of the greatest performances this year PERIOD. Will Smith. As always I will go into more detail about his performance but it has to be said right from the top that this film is all about and revolves around the performance of Will Smith and he is absolutely phenomenal. I have seen a lot of films this year (approximately 150 to date) and Will Smith might have the best performance of the year. He should but sadly won't get an Oscar nomination from this performance. The brilliance of I Am Legend is that so much of the first half of the film focuses on subjecting us to his life. This is a man who has been robbed of all human contact and literally is left to feel like he is the last man alive. It's not focused on or suggested in the film directly that he is the last man alive because he isn't and I don't think he or the viewers believe that but his isolation is unlike anything we've ever seen. We get a good hard look at his existence not just in one or two days but every day, day in and out and his survival and instinct, and his entertainment, his family, his life...everything and it just grips you because ultimately at least the first three quarters of the film is literally a one man show and I'm not sure anyone could carry it the way Will Smith does.Not much of a cast to speak which means I can spend more time on the focus of the film...did I mention him? Will Smith plays survivor Robert Neville and completely draws you into his character. He's tough and ruthless in order to survive but so emotionally distraught, lonely and his performance is just moving and completely enthralling, you can't take your eyes off of him. It might be his best performance and he has had some amazing ones before this. Alice Braga, and Charlie Tahan, make a small performance towards the end but nothing significant. I'm not sure I've ever done this before but I MUST give honorable mention to Abby, the Canine pooch that plays Samantha. Kudos to her trainers and to her because she becomes such a viable character and takes you and Smith through such a range of emotions. It's possibly one of the most important roles by an animal ever. Compare her to Wilson from Castaway...only alive.It is very fortunate for the makers of this film that Will Smith did the job he did because the package around him is not terrific. It's not bad but it has many flaws and part of the problem might be the lack of experience from director Francis Lawrence, who comes from a music video background. The problem with this is music video directors have this habit of feeling the need to cram all the story into the smallest possible package and use cheap special effects as though they were still working in the eighties with White Snake and I Am Legend is the perfect example. The very first scene where we see the 'monsters' as Neville approaches them and shines the light inadvertently on them is downright creepy and disturbing but from then on the 'monsters' look cheesy and ridiculous. The CGI is poor at best and as scary as they are...they look fake and cartoon-y and it ruins the atmosphere of the film completely. The story is good but just some of the small details like the special effects really make the actual film 'just okay.' However the world they create...the New York City presented after this breakout is breath taking and disturbing and silent and ominous and it's really something to see because it feels so real. No matter what the package presents itself as...and unfortunately it's a very short film...the amazing thing about I Am Legend is that the great is REALLY great and makes it a must see movie and something I want to watch again and again. Please see it and enjoy the great things about it and move past the small errors they made. 8.5/10",8,1,4,4 January 2008
The Bourne Legacy," Ho-hum follow up to an amazing franchise
","When I read about the latest instalment to the Bourne franchise, my first thought was could they do it without Matt Damon. The short answer to that is...no. Damon is Bourne and without Bourne there is no Bourne film and Legacy shows that while there is plenty of more story to tell you can't just leave behind the key elements. Bourne Legacy's high point is that you can't an epilogue to characters from the original trilogy. The people involved in Treadwell and Blackwater and the corrupt Government agents and also a play by play on where Bourne is. But then the film is basically saying...meanwhile...and showing us a different side of the Bourne program. This could be okay but they also changed the format of the film. It is far more political thriller than spy action flick. The Bourne series always managed to balance both. So the pacing is very slow comparatively. Its still a smart, well written, decently directed film but it doesn't hold its own against the others in the original trilogy.Jeremy Renner is Hollywood's It guy right now. Ever since The Hurt Locker his career has really sky rocketed. I like him but I can't ever seem to LOVE him. His performance in Legacy is decent but not amazing. Either him or his character doesn't have the stamina to really rivet you to the screen. He's not as dark and ominous as Damon's Bourne, and he just doesn't seem to get a lot of action scenes in the film. Rachel Weisz who is an incredible actress does a decent job as Renner's cohort in the film. She certainly gives the best performance in the film. They don't spend any time developing a romance between them but just let the characters develop themselves and that part works well. You will notice plenty of faces from the other films and get a much appreciated update of them and their stories. Edward Norton joins the cast and he's always a welcome addition and he made a great pseudo-villain.Director Tony Gilroy has been a Bourne co-writer since the first film so it was a wise decision to have him take over as director. He knows the series very well and the film still has the same feel as its predecessors. Whereas the first three films had this exotic gritty feel to the setting, it felt like Legacy tried too hard to capture the exotic locales instead of just letting it flow. For every action scene there were two long scenes of dramatic build up and it made the pace feel just too slow. Lovers of the Bourne franchise (which I am) will probably like Legacy but will ultimately leave them longing for the first three films. Bring back Damon! 7/10",7,2,8,20 August 2012
Dog Day Afternoon," A taut thriller made many times better by the absolutely brilliant Pacino
","I didn't feel like Dog Day Afternoon was quite the absolute classic that everyone has held it up to. I think the thing that makes it truly incredible is it is yet another showcase of a young actor and what made him Hollywood Royalty, the always astonishingly amazing Al Pacino. Perhaps the film was more controversial and shocking in the seventies being that it was based on very factual events and seems to have held very true to the reality of that situation. Certainly it has it's charms as a character study because you do get a very in depth look into the characters and their lives especially Sonny (played by Pacino.) It would seem to me that director Sidney Lumet recognizes talent like no other director in the history of Hollywood being that seventeen of his stars from his films went on to Oscar nominations. That makes him a world class director or just a really good judge of acting ability and I think it's the latter because it seems to me he just lets Pacino do his magic and it literally saves this film from being run of the mill and slipping into obscurity. There are dozens of films just like this that don't get the same accolades that this one does.Al Pacino plays conflicted and intense Sonny Wortzik. He is the reason to see this film as he goes through the emotional workings of what he has done and his entire life is pulled out before him and the media circus. It's an angry and powerful performance and he should receive a 10/10 his sole performance it is that good. John Cazale fits in with the story as quiet and dark partner Sal but he never really gets any moments to stand out and is second fiddle to Pacino easily. His character is just kind of there and doesn't really add or take away from anything in the film. Charles Durning is very good as the first lead officer on the scene who starts bargaining with Sonny. I would have like to have seen Durning and Pacino talk more and be involved longer but he gets replaced fairly quickly. Chris Sarandon, who was nominated for a Golden Globe and an Oscar for this role is decent as Pacino's male lover looking for a sex change. However, I think he is over hyped a little because I don't think his performance was THAT good and even though they're long phone conversation and a very important part and a turning point in the film I didn't think Sarandon was mind blowing by any means. James Broderick is also very good in a fairly small role as the bank manager.Most say the script (which won an Oscar) is smart and funny and witty and it is but I kind of feel like it's over analyzed and maybe put on too high of a pedestal. Outside of Pacino's brilliant performance everything else is pretty average. I mean if you subtract Pacino from the film it deserves maybe a six out of ten but he drives up the stakes with a heart wrenching performance. Impressively the entire film nearly takes place in and outside the bank and it's never boring, the story moves along at a great pace and never keeps you waiting for anything. The film isn't violent being only two shots are fired in the entire film but in true film noire style it is chock full of dark satire and the old message of sticking it to the man which evolved from the sixties into a Watergate society of the seventies. Dog Day Afternoon in any circle is considered a classic and I don't disagree. I just happen to think that Pacino is what makes the wheels spin and it's worth seeing for his performance and because it is a good movie, just falls short of being as great as everyone seems to think it is. 7.5/10",7,1,2,7 July 2008
Kick-Ass," Living up to its name, it does kick some serious...
","I remember when Kick-Ass came out and it was like instant cult status. Everyone was talking about it. For whatever reason it didn't seem all that important to me and I didn't see it. Ever since then this is one film that people BUG me constantly for having not seen. Well, the sequel is due out next week and since 2010 I have become a HUGE fan of Chloe Grace Moretz so I finally decided to give it a go. What a wild fun ride this was!! In many ways I think Kick-Ass is the ultimate super-hero spoof movie. They simply don't even know how to make spoof movies anymore but this one is smart and subtle in its style but in your face outrageous in the same breath. It is gratuitous in every sense of the word. It is ridiculously violent, the language is outrageous and for whatever reason it works perfectly in this film. It is an adult super-hero flick that holds nothing back. Throughout the film you will hear multiple superhero references from Spiderman to Batman but this is anything but. Bullets are flying, cursing everywhere, blood splattering and plenty of morbid laughter. It was fun. Very adult, ridiculous, over the top but insanely fun.They could not have cast the main character better. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is the perfect mis-understood 'nerd' who wants to be something more. He is very stereotypical but then that is the whole point of his character. He feels like the everyday Joe and yet becomes something so much more. He does this great physical comedy where you believe what he is trying to do but still laugh at his mistakes. Lyndsy Fonseca is the object of his affections. She's the popular girl and wants her to be his 'Mary Jane' so to speak. She does an alright job, nothing stand out but certainly serves her purpose and is absolutely a hot girl so it works. Christopher Mintz-Plasse is known for his comedy. He has had some really campy roles but he is very likable. He is used mostly sparingly in this, which I think is good because he might have just been a tad too much for a movie like this which is trying to be subtly funny and sarcastic. Mark Strong is excellent as the evil Frank D'Amico. Strong always makes a great villain and he fits this film very well. And what a terrific and iconic ending to his villainous role. Nicholas Cage has a small but vital role to the story. He is actually quite good in the part and takes a back seat to the other characters. I sort of saved the best for last in my books. Chloe Grace Moretz who has become something of an 'It' girl in Hollywood as of late is terrific in her breakthrough role as 'Hit-Girl' Her foul mouthed violent superhero is fun, disturbing and just almost too far and yet fits in so well with the film. She proves even then her star power and easily steals every scene. I wanted to see more interaction with her and Taylor-Johnson which perhaps we will get in the sequel.Matthew Vaughan has chosen his projects carefully and it has paid off because everything I have seen of his has been excellent. He seems to know how to handle action scenes but tell a great story and get the very most out of his characters. I would hazard a guess that he is a die-hard geek because he presents his super-heroes like real people in a real world that happens to be so over the top. Kick-Ass is such a unique blend of spoof and action and comedy and adult entertainment. Everything from the music montages, the cheeky and campy costumes and the insane action. This is well worth watching and very entertaining. Glad I finally saw it and looking forward to the sequel!! 8.5/10",8,3,4,10 August 2013
Unknown," An absolutely amazing Popcorn flick!! Best release of the year thus far!!
","I think Liam Neeson gained a whole new following with the release of mainstream action flick Taken. Unknown is most definitely marketed and presented with Taken in mind and as good as Taken was Unknown buries it!! This is the true heart of popcorn theatre flicks. If the sole purpose of movies is to entertain this one smashes it out of the park. Unknown is the perfect blend of the Bourne films, and Taken with a great story, solid thrills, great car chases, European scenery and a terrific mystery that ties up all the loose hands with an outstanding twist at the end. For the most part I kept thinking that the solution to the mystery would be anti-climatic or leave gaping plot holes and imagine my surprise and happiness when I was wrong and the ending was fantastic! It isn't the best acting, it isn't a brilliant artsy piece but it is the most entertaining movie I have seen in 2011 and there is nothing wrong with that!! One of the hardest working men in Hollywood Liam Neeson is becoming an enormous star force. He is very versatile and it turns out he is a great action star. Best of all he always seems very down to earth and makes a great underdog who always comes out swinging. Neeson is almost the same character from Taken but that's okay too because he is easy to watch and his intensity is perfect. Diane Kruger is Neeson's unwilling partner in the mystery and she is good too. They have good chemistry although it is never a romantic feeling chemistry. She has the intensity required in her role to keep up with Neeson and that's no easy task. January Jones is an old fashion Hollywood beauty but that doesn't make for a good actress. I'm not saying she's bad in her role but she certainly doesn't have the same level of quality as some of the other cast members. Her and Neeson look silly together as a couple, Neeson is bordering on being one of those old actors they always put with much younger hotter women. Maybe its Jones' character that doesn't give her a lot of depth but either way she isn't the best part of the cast. Aidan Quinn has a small but vital role that is quite good as the mystery man who takes Neeson's identity. The fight between the two of them at the end if downright excellent. Frank Langella has a very small cameo role but his presence is well received. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz is also very good in a quiet subtle role as Private Investigator Ernst Jürgen.Jaume Collet-Serra seems to be a studio director and hasn't had a lot of experience to his name. However, he did direct the absolutely outstanding horror flick Orphan and now this. Normally I purposely point to the lack of experience in a film making team but this one is a big exception. Collet-Serra, and the writing team of Stephen Cornwell, and Oliver Butcher have very few credits to their name but they pull this one off flawlessly and this should do great things for their mainstream careers. Whether you love action, mystery or thriller this film should not be missed!! This is one to have in your permanent collection and will impress anyone who simply loves movies!! 9.5/10",9,4,9,21 February 2011
Ghostbusters," Still one of the most entertaining films of all time
","Alright we're talking cultural Phenomenon here...Who Ya Gonna Call? The song, the action figures, the cartoons...this started it all. Does all that make it good?? No. But it was. It was brilliant and funny, and scary, and action packed and made for adults. The eighties was a key time when film makers realized that adults actually wanted comedy for them. John Candy, Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Bill Murray, Dan Akroyd, these guys did their best comedy work during this time. Ghostbusters was and still is the most brilliant creation of Dan Akroyd and one of the most entertaining films as well.Ghostbusters although it seems to have become a childhood type thing was not made for children. Some of the ghost scenes and more scary scenes are easy for adults but could be quite disturbing to children. Plus the numerous sexual situations. The cast of this film couldn't be any more perfect which is funny considering how much the cast changed from who Akroyd wanted and who they got. Bill Murray in one of his best comedic roles becomes almost over used in his portrayal as Dr. Peter Venkman. Murray has to be one of the only comedic actors who can run that borderline between being funny and cute, to being annoying and overused (ie: Will Ferrell) His character runs that line but has some of the best and most memorable scenes. Akroyd's Ray Stanz is excitable and eager and holds the team together along with Harold Ramis' Egon Spengler. Ramis seems to just fit right in which is strange because he doesn't really fit the profile for the rest of the team. Sigourney Weaver as Dana Barrett, Murray's love interest and the female lead of the film does a great job as well. Her and Murray have some great scenes and she gets to go from Upper class reserved woman to possessed over sexed demon.Ernie Hudson...well Hudson is a great actor but he is underused and strangely pointless for the cast. There was never a need for a fourth ghost buster and he gets rather left out most of the time. Although he does get to deliver the infamous closing line of the film 'I love this town!' Ivan Reitman who is an amazing director when it comes to making films that people love and making them just fun to watch does a great job of keeping everything interesting and keeping the story flowing. His idea of showing us how they got started was brilliant. I don't think a remake of this film could ever exist because you could never get the overall chemistry that came out of this cast which is one of the things that made it great along with their abilities to deliver their lines. The film doesn't just have one featured story but instead we see how they get started, their first ghost capture and all the ghosts in the middle along with the amazing hit theme song. If you haven't seen this original eighties classic...well I'm surprised but even if you have watch it again and again because it's one that'll live forever as one of the most entertaining films in history. 9/10",9,0,0,27 August 2005
Gran Torino," An absolute masterpiece---Eastwood gives a masterful piece of film making
","Rumor has this being Clint Eastwood's last acting performance (please Mr. Eastwood don't do it!!) But if he did decide to retire from acting Gran Torino would have been the most brilliant and effective swan song he could have thought of. The man stars, directs, and sings in the film but that alone doesn't make it brilliant. The sheer power of the film is what makes it incredible. Gran Torino is this intense and amazing character study led by the absolutely mind blowing character of Walt Kowalski created, played by, embodied by Mr. Eastwood. The character is probably the most unlikable, growly, peculiar, twisted of Eastwood's characters and yet he comes full circle and has such a huge character arc and goes through so many changes. The real brilliance is that you know Kowalski has a history, and so much has happened to him that has grated on him and made him very bitter about the world around him. It isn't really about the races around him, or his rude demeanor towards youth, and different cultures but just about the things that have happened to him in his past. While you never really discover details you know the history is there drawing you into the story and this man's life.Clint Eastwood is Hollywood royalty and I am biased because several years ago I became an instant adoring fan of Eastwood both as an actor and director. Still certainly you have to have a taste for his performances. Certain people can say that Eastwood is the same in every role but if you look closer you will see Eastwood has some definitive talent in really lighting up the screen. Eastwood's Kowalski will most definitely be remembered as being an amazing character with a great arc and he was robbed of getting no award nominations at the Oscars. Christopher Carley has a small role but pertinent and quite well done as the very young Father Janovich, who tries to reach out to Walt without much luck. Carley does very well opposite Eastwood in a small role. Ahney Her is brilliant as the feisty young Hmong neighbor Sue who is the first to really lock horns with Kowalski and win him over with her quick wit. She does a terrific job and should have gotten more notice for her part. Also brilliant and really a key to the film is Bee Vang who becomes Kowalski's partner, friend and misplaced student of sorts. The two of them, Eastwood and Vang, are just brilliant opposite each other. Vang's character goes through enormous changes throughout the film and the two of them really play off of each other.The film's pace is not break neck by any means and yet you will find yourself completely enthralled! The film will shock you, make you laugh, cry, and be amazed all at once. It is funny to me that people don't find the film offensive, or at least that I've heard, considering the amount of racial language and crude comments are used but it seems to be acceptable in the context used in the film. Eastwood's flare for direction hasn't changed. He knows how to bring the most out of his characters and make the story feel so incredibly real. You owe yourself to see this beautifully made, incredibly captivating drama. It will leave you wide eyed and breathless and you won't be disappointed. 10/10",10,2,9,12 March 2009
Hero," Crouching cash in!!
","I am not a member of this recent fad of Hong Kong films. I have seen maybe three of those films in my life time. I waited off the hype for Crouching Tiger determined to not enjoy it because everyone else did!! Immature or what!! But I did enjoy it, it was excellent. Then comes the inevitable cash in on that crazy fad in Hero. Not only do they utilize what made Crouching Tiger such a phenomenal hit but they use a well known Chinese actor who has made the cross over to English film in Jet Li. Hero was a beautiful movie. The cinematography was breathtaking and the use of color and dance like choreography is a must see spectacle. Where Hero falls short is a dead end story line with little background information that would have taken this from a run of the mill action flick to amazing epic story.Our Hero played by Jet Li who is nameless in the film is a young man who initially appears to have saved the Emperor of Qin. A Chinese nation that is conquering everything around it. The Emperor who is seen as a tyrant has had many attempts on his life and the nameless hero appears to have systematically eliminated those assassins in order to receive, praise, reward and time with the Emperor. As the young hero weaves his tale of how he eliminated these master Assassins a much more sinister plot unfolds and the Emperor discovers this young man collaborated with these other Assassins only to kill the Emperor himself.The two master Assassins in the film are almost a sub story worth mentioning. Broken Sword and Flying snow are lovers brought together by a joint hatred of the Emperor. The film goes into a little bit of detail about how they met and their previous attempted assassination of the King. Everyone in this film is excellent with the exception of Jet Li. This man was not meant to be an actor. He is a brilliant martial artist but his stone cold expressions never change and he is so lifeless in every role he plays. Fortunately for him some of his roles require this lifeless stone face so it works for him. He made a bad ass villain in Lethal Weapon 4. He shows little to no emotion in this film and this film is wrought with emotions. The nice thing about this film being brought over to mainstream US theaters is it still holds it's Chinese traditions and heritage dearly. The philosophy and culture are so amazing that it makes you want to know more about these people. They were so passionate about honor and life and death and right and wrong. I highly recommend anyone wanting to learn more about Eastern culture to watch The Last Samurai with Tom Cruise as it tends to explain more about it. This film drops you into the middle of it leaving you to assume you know certain aspects of their culture. Nonetheless the film is mysterious and beautiful, breathtaking and stunning. The use of color is intriguing, reds, greens, oranges, it all must have a meaning. You could discuss and pick apart this film for days. Were it not for these things, this film would be dead in the water because the story is very weak and plays out more like a video game than a film. Battle, Battle, cut scene, Battle, Boss, cut scene, Battle Battle, Boss END.Still if you're a fan of the Hong Kong film craze you will love this film and it's worth seeing for the cinematic of it all and the amazing cinematography of the cast. 6/10",Null,0,1,27 November 2004
The Hurt Locker," Another taste of 'war is hell' but it works, entertains and makes you think
","I walked into The Hurt Locker completely blind. I was visiting the big city, had the opportunity to see movies we would never get in my small town and rushed headfirst into The Hurt Locker. This could have been a dangerous undertaking going in with zero expectations and not knowing virtually anything about the film. As it turned out it was more or less exactly what you would expect from hearing a brief rundown of the plot.'Forced to play a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse in the chaos of war, an elite Army bomb squad unit must come together in a city where everyone is a potential enemy and every object could be a deadly bomb.'That's it, in a nutshell, no more, no less. The film is another why the current war on terror is bad and messes people up but is somehow so crucial to the humanitarian side of things. However I sound like I am being sarcastic towards the film and I don't mean to be. The cast is great, the suspense is truly top notch and the filming of the movie puts you literally dead center of the terrifying action in Iraq.Character actor Jeremy Renner plays Staff Sergeant William James, a talented soldier with some emotional problems that leaves him a thrill seeking, danger hunting man that often puts other lives in danger. Renner leads the cast well but he just falls short of truly shining. He doesn't seem to quite have the guts to really take control of the film or the cast. Anthony Mackie also has a great role as Sergeant JT Sanborn who is the more level headed of the team and has to hold everyone together. Mackie also shows some great potential but much like Renner falls just short of really shining in the film. Brian Geraghty has the opportunity to really knock an incredible emotional character out of the park playing Specialist Owen Eldridge who is emotionally distraught over losing their original team leader and all the spoils of war. Whether it is the way the characters are written or perhaps the lack of depth to them every character in the film seems to just reach a cliff of potential but never quite goes over the cliff. I noticed one a poster going into the theater than much bigger named actor Ralph Fiennes is listed on the poster which is ludicrous considering he shows up in the film for literally minutes and makes no difference to the plot one way or another.So with a solid but not enlightened cast we turn to the plot and the action. The film is truly brilliantly shot by Kathryn Bigelow (remember the early nineties Patrick Swayze/Keanu Reeves classic Point Break...yah her) which, as I said before, literally drops you into the Iraq war in a way I have yet to have seen on film. The tension and suspense is incredible considering these guys uncover bombs hidden inside everything from cars to garbage piles to bodies to live people. You won't get any higher sense of urgency then watching these guys putting their life in their hands again and again. You could describe The Hurt Locker as having a weak plot considering the only real idea in the film is pure survival BUT that only means that the film feels all the more real. It does entertain in a morbid sort of way but it definitely has a powerful message behind it as well. Absolutely worth checking out for fans of war films or just for someone looking for something serious and thought provoking and see some potential in hopefully future big name actors. 8/10",8,2,5,24 August 2009
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The far too soon reboot already starts to show flaws
","Despite the fact that The Amazing Spiderman was an unnecessary and far too soon reboot, the first one was pretty darn entertaining. I was very sceptical they could continue this success given this was simply too soon! I was right and wrong. The Amazing Spiderman 2 is still reasonably entertaining. However, they dug themselves the exact same grave that Raimi's Spiderman did. Why do film makers not understand that crowded a movie with two or three movies worth of material make it more 'epic?' One villain, one hero, one story...maybe a sub story is all that is required. Amazing Spiderman 2 has multiple villains, multiple stories and enough content to be spread over another movie. The special effects are very good, even the CGI was decent enough. The acting is decent but for two (more like three) would be excellent villains they get half of the screen time and character development that they should have. It just feels messy at times. Now all that negativity out of the way the film does feel epic in stature at times, just the way a superhero film should. They absolutely bring Spidey to life (even if some of his more well known quirks feel a little forced.)I wasn't sure how Andrew Garfield would fare as Spiderman originally. He is a terrific actor but was he right for this? He did a very solid job in the first but this time around I started to see some things about his portrayal that didn't strike me in the right way. His Peter Parker is too awkward, almost eccentric and he physical quirks are almost irritating. He is much better as Spiderman but plays it over the top. I just think Tobey Maquire was more believable and better suited. Garfield is either too serious in the role or overplaying it. Emma Stone is very good as Gwen. Her and Garfield have good chemistry and she is such an incredibly versatile actress/comedian and this is a good turn for her. Her character has always been the most developed and gets a lot of the best story. Jamie Foxx is our villain Electro. Foxx is also very talented obviously and he is great as the villain. The problem is the lack of development for his character and how incredibly predictable and typical his character is. The geeky, nerdy and misunderstood before and the powerful mutated villain after. Its excruciatingly cookie cutter. There is just too many superhero flicks out there to replay the same old story. Dane DeHaan takes over the helm of Harry Osborn and Green Goblin. I can understand introducing Osborn but to add in Goblin was too much. DeHaan is decent and could be campy but actually pulls off the insane role quite well. Main supporting cast includes Sally Field, Colm Feore and Felicity Jones, all of whom are good.When I see a film like this I can practically sense how over-eager and excited the director gets. Marc Webb managed to successfully reboot a series that most people thought was too soon and then he excitedly jammed everything into a sequel (which made a ton of money so what do I know?) I did enjoy it, but I was far from floored by it. As usual, the 3D did nothing for me and was unimpressive. That isn't the fault of the film but I still have yet to see 3D really blow me away in any way. The story moves along at a good pace but as I said is very crowded. The humour feels significantly forced at certain times especially Spidey's one-liners (humming the old cartoon Spiderman theme was not amusing and not even cheeky but rather forced and annoying.) The best part of the story is the relationship between Gwen and Peter and their romance. I can understand and appreciate they chose not to introduce Mary Jane because you really do become invested in their young romance even though she is not his 'soul mate' so to speak. Most fans of Spiderman will rejoice in this sequel and there are some good points to it but for me it was a gradual step down from the first film and a significant step down from Raimi's trilogy. I think a change in director might be their best move at this point before this series gets buried like the last. 7/10",7,0,3,22 May 2014
Back to the Future Part III," One of the best trilogies in film history wraps up with its own unique flare
","As a whole I absolutely adore the Back To The Future trilogy. It is easily one of my all time favourite series' of films. In watching them again recently, I was immediately struck with how well the series has aged in plot, characters and special effects but also how completely different each instalment of this series is. Usually with any series of films, they all have a common style and feel like Lord of The Rings or Star Wars and certainly Back To The Future seamlessly fits together but each and every one of them is as different as they possibly can be. Back To The Future 3 played on Zemeckis' love of old school Westerns (something I feel as well) and he does it nearly perfectly. If you step back and look at this movie and ignore the time travel aspect, it holds its own as a Western. You have the dusty Western town, the old tavern, gun fights, festivals, trains and robberies. It has everything and that makes it incredibly fun. Add in to the fact that you already are completely hooked on Marty and Doc's adventure and everything they've been through and this is one of the most fun times you can have watching a movie. They couldn't have wrapped this up much better than this.Cleverly, each and every instalment of this series is fresh and they do that by keeping the main characters ever evolving. The difference between the Marty McFly of Back To The Future 1 and 2 was very evident and this time Marty is sort of more like he was in the first film. Christopher Lloyd's Doc is the one who gets the huge character development this time around. It doesn't matter how you shake it, Michael J. Fox and Christopher LLoyd are flat out amazing in their respective roles and they have amazing chemistry opposite each other. Lloyd's Doc Brown is significantly less zany and eccentric and more controlled and gets to fall in love and he's the level headed one this time around. He is by far more heroic in this sequel and we, as fans, welcome that!! Mary Steenburgen joins the cast as Lloyd's love interest and she is terrific. She is just a tad bit cheesy and sort of southern school ma'arm type and it works perfect. She has terrific chemistry with Lloyd and the only downside is we don't get to see more from her. She is a welcomed addition to the cast. Thomas F. Wilson proves his villainous versatility yet again playing 'Mad Dog' Tannen, the crazy wild west killer and does it perfectly. He even gets to play it more seriously than his previous Biff incarnations. Lea Thompson is one again reduced but this time is just barely a cameo in the movie which is a little unfortunate since she was so good in the first film. Elisabeth Shue is also barely a blip on the casting list as Marty's girlfriend back in 1985.Nothing touches the first film. That movie is one of the best ever made period. However, Robert Zemeckis took that idea and went crazy with it in all the best ways and created two bizarre, out there, insanely fun sequels that are as different from the first as they are from each other. I could never tell you my favourite parts of 'Back To The Future without listing a half dozen scenes from the second film and from this one. 'Where'd you learn to shoot like that?' Pie plate Frisbee, the incredible climactic train scene at the end which easily rivals any of the best scenes of this trilogy or of any modern day blockbuster. Each and every time I watch it I am literally on the edge of my seat watching it. Its fantastic and Zemeckis proves why he is one of the best directors out there. No matter which instalment is your favourite you have to pay respect to how terrific they all are and you have to watch them as one giant epic and this one was as good as ever this time around. I look forward to watching my favourite trilogy again soon!! 9/10",9,5,6,21 August 2014
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," It gets better but mostly because Pattinson is graciously absent
","After the drivel that was Twilight, I forced myself to continue to the next instalment and thank goodness it was actually better. The biggest change between this and Twilight is the action is ramped up and the special effects are so much better (though some of the CGI was just barely passable.) I honestly think that the thing that made New Moon better than the first was that this sequel focuses more on Bella and Jacob and Edward is practically gone the entire film and what a relief that is. His creepy obsessive love was never entertaining and the chemistry is far better between Stewart and Lautner than her and Pattinson.Once again despite what many fans and reviewers say I don't mind Kristen Stewart in this role. I don't think the role is anything great to sink her teeth into but I think her depression of Edward leaving and her performance is decent and watchable and shows a lot of emotion. It is immature and childish but so is the entire series so that means she fits it perfectly. Taylor Lautner gets to stop up his starring role and he does okay. He's definitely better than Pattinson's performance. He still overacts and his melodramatics are annoying but he still does okay and has better chemistry with Stewart. Ashley Greene comes through in a stronger and better role than most as Alice Cullen. Robert Pattinson returns in the exact same fashion as the last film...horrible. He over acts, his melodramatics are 500 times that is necessary, and I insist he was instructed to just act terrible.Director Chris Weitz takes over for directing and there is no doubt he is a much better director than Hardwicke was from the original. I think he does try and tone down the campy feel from the original but that train has already been set in motion. But more action and more scenery and even a trip to Italy to visit the Vampires makes this superior to the original and actually worth looking at. Unfortunately you have to sit through the crap that was Twilight to follow into this one. 7/10",7,3,8,15 January 2012
The Illusionist," Rather light little tale about a magician and his love...nothing shocking or surprising
","The Illusionist is good but that's just it...that's where it ends. The film has plenty of strong actors, a decent story, potential for a great period piece but instead the entire film beginning to end is just okay. The acting is 'just okay', the direction is 'just okay', the story...'just okay' and the twist at the end is easy to see coming which is unfortunate because it holds a lot of stock in it but I figured it out and I rarely figure anything out in a film with a twist. Despite taking place in Vienna at the turn of the century there is nothing historic about the film and despite moments of action, mystery and intrigue there just isn't anything to shout about...it's an all around average film...not bad...just not impressive.Edward Norton is the lead as mysterious magician Eisenheim who, as a boy, fell for a girl far from his social standing and then lost touch with her seemingly forever. He traveled the world and became a renowned magician. It has been a long time since Norton took the helm in a lead role and there is no doubt that Norton is a great actor, he blew me away in Primal Fear, and American History X, both Academy Award nominated roles. However Norton's return to lead is less than impressive. He does captivate and he's easy to watch but his role is so bland and although he does his utmost to capture the mystery and romance it never quite flies the way it could or should have. Jessica Biel is his lady friend who he reunites with many years later and begins an illicit affair. I don't know if Biel is a good actor yet, I haven't decided. I know that I've seen her in some real stinkers including Stealth. Her English accent is bad and overdone, but her chemistry with Norton is good and they play well off each other so they do alright in the roles. One of my newest favorite actors Paul Giamatti plays Inspector Uhl who is investigating a murder and all paths one way or another keep leading him to the Magician. Giamatti's role is unfortunately small and does not allow him to do anything fantastic which is kind of the ongoing feat behind this film. Finally the nemesis is played by the appropriately evil looking Rufus Sewell as the Crown Prince who appears to be the most realistic suspect in the murder but no one dares go after. He's overbearing and angry and a great nemesis to Norton but as with everyone else's part he is held back by the script and story.With more epic proportions, The Illusionist could have really been something. And it's not that it's not worth seeing...in fact it's a cute little film and actually a very nice twisting sort of romance but it's just not as spectacular as it could have been and that is disappointing. New film maker Neil Burger has a habit of overlooking details that could make a film great. His very first Indie film 'Interview With The Assassin' could have really been incredible but instead was average at best and The Illusionist falls to the same fate. So worth watching but won't blow you away....get something else with it to satisfy you. Average in every way. 7/10",7,1,2,4 February 2007
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," The typical sequel pulls off watchable but still hurts the series
","As stated at the end of my Fantastic 4 review it was practically a given that a sequel would follow the 2005 film and sure enough it did. But can you make a sequel to an already average superhero film that bases itself more towards kids and campy cartoony super powers?? Well certainly they were going to try and much to my surprise for the most part they pull off a better than expected sequel considering they had no origin to deal with. They did so by bringing in The Silver Surfer who turns out to be the best part of this average sequel and a very cool character who probably could have held his own film. Tim Story returns to direct the sequel which was also a plus because he knew the direction to take it and the characters and how to properly set everything up. That being said you can't build a stellar sequel off of an already very average film so that sequel ended up being a little more average.All of the original cast returns...some better than others. Ioan Gruffudd, Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis are the Fantastic Four respectively. Chiklis is still the highlight as the overwhelming brute strength 'Thing' or 'Ben Grimm.' Jessica Alba did her best to look a little more like the Sue Storm that comic book goers enjoy after getting some flack because she 'looked nothing like her.' She does a decent job and in fact gets some great lines and scenes and pretty much steals the show. Evans returns as Johnny Storm who really was a forefront character in the original but they toned him down a little for the sequel, he still gets a lot of scenes including the first fight with The Silver Surfer but he's not quite as large and loud as he was in the original. Gruffudd kind of gets most of the script and screen time as Mr. Fantastic (Reed Richards.) He is just very bland and with his powers being the most cartoony and kid like it doesn't exactly help to take his character seriously. He doesn't really impress me in the role or throughout the film. Julian McMahon returns rather forcefully as Victor Von Doom and I mean forcefully because it was like they had to really push themselves to find a way to bring him back. His terrific performance in the original film made for a great bad guy and they kind of moved him to the back burner for the sequel but made sure he was there just for the sake of being there and that's unfortunate. The incredible Doug Jones who is not very recognizable because he is using his incredible talents to portray monsters, beasts, imps, zombies and creatures of all kind plays the physical Silver Surfer while Laurence Fishburne does the Surfer's voice. Jones is just an awesome talent and does such a terrific job with very specific movements and body language and is not afraid to hide his visage behind make up or CGI or anything else. He very well may be one of the acting greats in this capacity. Fishburne's voice definitely suits the Surfer and is terrific.The Silver Surfer visually and with plot line single handedly makes Fantastic 4: Rise of The Silver Surfer worthwhile. Sadly the Fantastic 4 themselves really doesn't add anything to the film and the visual effects are impressive but still sub par considering the short story and everything happening so fast. Maybe as many critic suggested they are trying to turn themselves more into a kid franchise and that makes sense and young kids probably will enjoy it more than an adult but magnificent children's epics like Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, and even Pixar films this still falls short of anything more than average. It's a renter for the kids or maybe even wait until it appears on Television because seeing it in the theater doesn't make it any more impressive. Average all around. 6.5/10",6,2,5,1 July 2007
Grudge Match," Some huge missed potential but still something for the fans
","Anyone who reads my reviews regularly will know that this is a biased review for me. I live and breath Stallone. I adore the guy, grew up with him as many of you did, and will pay through the teeth to see anything he does no matter how bad and I will desperately try to find the good in it. So its safe to say my expectations were extremely high because I was about to see my Hollywood hero on the big screen again and boxing nonetheless. On top of that Robert DeNiro is high up on my Hollywood heroes list and synonymous with boxing in his own right (though I hated Raging Bull..I appreciate it for its classic status.) The potential to do this movie right was huge. In the right hands they could have made this a cutting edge comedy/drama that was geared towards an older demographic and fill it with heart, and passion and fun. They achieve all this but on a much, much smaller scale. It has a little bit of comedy, satire, drama and is geared towards that older demographic and has a little heart, passion and a little fun. I would guess that our director probably didn't really put his full effort into this and let some of it fall flat which is truly unfortunate. On top of that you have easily one of the worst performances I have seen on the big screen in a very, very long time (more on that in a moment.) Still the movie is fun at times and tells a decent story.Sylvester Stallone is great in his role as Razor Sharp. He isn't Rocky so you can toss those comparisons out the window. He's a smart guy, artistic, passionate who hasn't moved with the times very well and was close to being on top but then spent the rest of his life working an assembly line in a factory. His performance is much better than what the script gives him to work with. I am glad to say he is one of the better parts of this movie. Same could be said for Robert Deniro. His role as the pompous, loud mouth Billy 'The Kid' is perfect for him. Granted its sort of Deniro being Deniro but sometimes that is what's best and it works. The sub-story with him and his long lost son and grandson add a lot of the heart to the film. The thing that perhaps disappointed me the most was the lack of true chemistry between Deniro and Stallone. The entire film hinges on their comedic and passionate rivalry and that part of the film feels forced and often falls flat right up until the end. I worried immediately from the trailers that Kevin Hart would be obnoxious, annoying and distracting. Ding Ding Ding. Called that bout. He is all of that and more. His character doesn't fit this film even a little bit and he's incredibly annoying. Grudge Match is a very dry, satirical comedy not slapstick and Kevin Hart is just being himself and it doesn't work. There is a hint of fun chemistry between him and Stallone and also him and Arkin but they don't play on that enough to make it worthwhile. Alan Arkin (as many reviewers have pointed out) yet again plays a crotchety old man. However, his role is terrific and I loved it. He demonstrates a re-invigoration and he makes Stallone seem slightly younger than what he is. Arkin could have been amazing in the part with a better script but then most of them could have been. A better script would not have saved Kim Basinger. Being buried alive twenty feet deep couldn't have saved her from one of the worst performances on screen I've seen in years. She is wooden, campy, looks high, is so full of plastic she can't even move her face...she is just awful. I can't believe she didn't get nominated for Razzies when Stallone and Deniro did! Kim...let it go, pack it in, you're horrendous on camera. She took the entire cast down at least a peg or two. Jon Bernthal and Camden Gray are decent in their perspective roles as Deniro's son and grandson. Gray is a little bit campy (but adorable) and Bernthal does a solid job considering the character is underused.I can't help but wonder how much better this would have been had Stallone did directing duties. If you wonder how much potential was lost on this movie just watch the last half hour. That is the best of the entire film with a well choreographed, uplifted and well done fight scene that wraps everything up in a great way. It was just amazing as a fan to see Stallone back in the ring probably for one last time (although if Creed happens then maybe not.) Director Peter Segal is a decent director but he is a through and through comedy director and this film needed someone who can handle comedy/drama/and an emotional story to really bring out the details. The script was sub-par there is no doubt about it and its unfortunate because they had a lot of ducks in a row but then they start throwing rocks into the mix. Still Stallone/Deniro/Rocky fans will find enough in this to be redeemable and enjoyable. I am certainly glad I saw it but for the average film goer you will likely find it nearly boring and certain bad scenes drag the film down significantly. I hate that Stallone's films aren't doing so well except for The Expendables because I don't want him to slow down one bit. 6/10",6,10,15,1 January 2014
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Brilliant, touching and uplifting, an adventure in living life
","I wasn't sure what to expect from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button so I went in with little to no expectations. I just knew I wanted to see it. This film certainly won't be for everyone. First of all anyone expecting to see some sort of slick adventure or action or even a typical Brad Pitt vehicle will be disappointed. The film clocks in at nearly three hours and is very slow paced but the sheer intelligence of the film is mind blowing. It is such a beautiful piece of art that brings tears to your eyes making you contemplate life and death and everything about it. Maybe it just hit home for me I don't know but it was just a beautiful story. Essentially nothing of any major interest happens during the lengthy life story of Benjamin Button but the entire schtick to the story is that Button is aging backwards. He is born as an outcast, a crippled, shriveled old man who ironically is raised in a New Orleans Old Age Home. If anything you are held to the screen by sheer curiosity of watching this boy grow backwards. Hence what truly makes this a curious case. This film is a combination of a lot of different flavors YES it also includes a touch of Forrest Gump (also written by The Curious Case of Benjamin Button writer co-writer Eric Roth), Dickens' Great Expectations, with an F. Scott Fitzgerald flare (the author whose short story inspired the film.) Brad Pitt is a huge movie star but there is no doubt that he also has some really incredible acting ability proved earlier in his career with incredible roles in Se7en and 12 Monkeys. His performance as Benjamin is subtly brilliant. It doesn't really take your breath away but rather endears you to him over a course of time. The use of Pitt in the CGI scenes was disturbing and well done all at once. Cate Blanchett who I am NOT a fan of is actually decent as the love of Button's life Daisy. They don't exactly have outstanding chemistry but somehow they manage to pull it off. The supporting cast is terrific but they really pale to the performance by Pitt. Julia Ormond does a good job in a small role but she has very intense aura about her. Jason Flemyng does a terrific job as Button's father and Taraji P. Henson is brilliant as Pitt's adopted mother who runs an old age home.I'm actually very impressed that director David Fincher pulled this film off. It is a very ambitious film and although it certainly isn't for everyone Fincher pulls off this fantasy epic very well. fincher's past is critically acclaimed and he has a lot of fans from Fight Club (a movie I didn't care for at all), and Zodiac which was ambitious but missing so much to it. He did however create the brilliance of Se7en and The Game so perhaps he does have some talent to speak of. If you are willing to watch an epic about a man and his entire life and really see the film for it's true message then you will truly enjoy this film. 9/10",9,0,2,12 January 2009
Transformers," Big, Huge, and downright amazing...throw my thoughts into the argument
","Well this summer is turning into really something. Usually I can pinpoint one great summer blockbuster that I actually think is a blockbuster. This summer I've already been treated to THREE huge 10/10's for me and Transformers was no exception. As with any big Michael Bay film this one appears to be steeped in controversy as warring factions either loved it with a passion or hated it to their very core. I think for once I am in the majority. I am an eighties child and I might have had a Transformer figure or two but I can't ever remember sitting down to watch the cartoons...or reading the comics...it just didn't happen for me. I remember them, I mean they were everywhere so I had no real biased towards or against The Transformers. Still the trailers made it look like an awesome special effects action extravaganza and sure enough it probably is THEE big budget, explosions and just a huge Summer movie. Transformers should and will appease the most adamant Transformers fans and newcomers to the entire subject and just rock them to the core. Transformers creates a decent world and plot line and then throws the most unimaginable creatures into it and where the film could have been campy and ridiculous they pulled off every inch of the exact opposite. It wasn't perfect, it had it's share of short comings but the most important thing is that you won't spend a minute regretting your time in the theater watching this true 'blockbuster.' Shia LaBeouf, who is really becoming the 'IT' kid for Blockbusters as of late (Disturbia, Indiana Jones IV), plays unsuspecting geeky high schooler Sam Witwicky. The best thing about LaBeouf in all his roles is that he's very down to earth. He looks like the guy next door, an average joe and to have this incredible thing happens to him is just very watchable. LaBeouf ultimately is always the same in his performances. I have yet to see anything different from him and yet it works every time and it works for this film. He holds the screen well amidst some 'big' co-stars. Relative newcomer Megan Fox is LaBeouf's love interest who is the typical popular girl who gets thrown into a crazy situation with the geeky kid and pushes them together. Fox is hot...there isn't any denying that but that doesn't mean she fits the film. In fact she sticks out as never really doing anything. She truly is the exact definition of eye-candy because she is always weary short skirts, low cut tops and they even shoot her from very specific angles but never once does she have any real purpose to the film. Even her performance is very dry and low key and just all around rather disappointing. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson play military men bent on protecting US Interests from the Transformers. Both do a decent job although the roles are very small and I would have especially liked to see a bigger from Duhamel who I really like and I think he has a lot of potential for the big screen. The supporting cast includes Jon Voight, John Turturro, Anthony Anderson, and Rachael Taylor. With the exception of Turturro they all do a decent job with their small roles. Turturro is overblown, overacted, and kind of silly for the film.The human actors in general are not what this film is about and the film makers including director Michael Bay made sure of that by making the Transformers truly larger than life with downright incredible CGI, voice over work from terrific voice actors including Peter Cullen, and Charles Adler both who did voice work on the original Transformers series. The Transformers had personalities and distinct maneuvers and you could easily pick a favorite. You never once got tired of watching them transform which was just downright cool every single time. The special effects where amazing!! In true Michael Bay style things get blown up a lot and some people seemed to wanna complain and moan about that but if it works it works and in this case it most definitely works. Is it shallow at time? Definitely. Plot holes? Well there almost has to be. It doesn't change the world it just is one of the best films of the year for entertainment purposes and will most likely go on to be one of the highest grossing films of all time because it's DAMN entertaining. Despite what people say about Bay I think he has the potential to tell a great story with incredible visuals. I thought The Island was really good, Armageddon, and The Rock, downright incredible action films and Transformers lives up to that reputation. In the beginning of the film I was a little worried that the pace was a little slow considering the film clocks in at a HUGE 2 1/2 hours, some of the comedy in the film is oddly placed and sometimes seemingly inappropriate and the dialog definitely borders cheesy. But there is just something really impressive about the film that makes you overlook all of that. The battles and the action and the special effects are incredible. It pretty much meets almost anyones expectations and knocks it out of the park. See it for yourself and experience a once in a life time film. 9.5/10",9,3,9,6 July 2007
Lincoln," Thoroughly mis-represented and fell way short of my expectations
","I love Steven Spielberg and I was so incredibly thrilled when I heard of this film. This was probably one of my most anticipated films of the year. I drove three hours to see the movie. I figured there was no way I could miss on this one. I was wrong. I read a few reviews on IMDb and they all voiced many of the same complaints I had. The biggest perhaps is that Lincoln...has very little to do with Lincoln. This film is in actuality 99% about the passing of the 13th Amendment. Lincoln is a player in all of it but this isn't about his life. In fact it barely scratches the surface of a blink in his presidency. How dare they call a film Lincoln and then not even bother to show him giving the Gettysburg address? They barely touch the assassination and the film is nearly entirely devoted to everyone in the House of Representatives arguing and the lobbyists trying to get the votes. Parts of it are interesting, uplifting and emotional but it runs far too long to only be about the passing of this bill. Was it a big moment in history? Of course. Should they have called it Lincoln? No. Some decent performances, and the few emotional moments save the film from being utter crap. If not for the fact that Spielberg was behind the camera and some strong lead performers this would have tanked completely.Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant as Lincoln. What a shame the film wasn't actually about him because he would have been heralded for his brilliant performance. He gives this subtle, quiet determination to Lincoln and shows just how incredibly charismatic Lincoln was. He is just awesome in the role. Sally Field is good as Mary Todd Lincoln. She's good but she's not great. I am a big fan of hers but I felt like she really overplayed the role. I mean considering what this movie is about her character should have been a very tiny part of the big picture. Instead they awkwardly force her manic, bi-polar personality into the story which makes her overly dramatic and makes her outburst scenes seem almost silly. Her and Day-Lewis do have good chemistry and they play well off of each other. Again, if the film had actually been about Lincoln she could have been amazing. David Strathairn is very good as Lincoln's chief of staff and adviser William Seward. He holds his own against Day-Lewis and the two of them together are excellent. Tommy Lee Jones gives a stand out performance as the outspoken Thaddeus Stevens. It's not a big role but his performance makes you take notice. James Spader also plays a top notch role as lobbyist Bilbo. He just has this distinct charisma in the role and he's fun to watch. The supporting cast is a virtual whose who of Hollywood A and B listers. You will recognize nearly every person on screen. Joseph Gordon Levitt has a very small, almost insignificant role as Robert Lincoln. He gets one good scene with Day-Lewis and is otherwise underused. Jackie Earle Haley, Bruce McGill and Jared Harris are a few of the supporting actors who give solid performances.As you can tell I was not disappointed with the cast. Everyone was in place, everyone did well and there were some truly amazing performances. I suppose my biggest problem with the film is simply how disappointed I was that this wasn't about Lincoln's life. I expected a sweeping epic bio-pic about his life or at the very least his presidency and it was not even close. It shouldn't surprise me much that critics love this film and it is sweeping the awards categories. They are strictly picking this on the merit of heavyweights like Spielberg, Day-Lewis, Lee Jones etc. and the fact that it is a powerful moment in American history. The truth of the matter is that the mainstream public will be disappointed in this film. Some will be caught in the hype created by the critics who rave about it but when you peel back the layers of this film you will certainly see how misrepresented it was and how different it could have been. 6/10",6,3,8,14 December 2012
Children of Men," A brilliant and disturbing vision of the future but lacking a few key story elements
","Children of Men is very close to being one amazing film...a mind blowing experience. The cinematography is as brilliant as they say and as the Academy Awards bestowed on them. The characters are well done and the world they create is perhaps one of the very best in sci-fi movie history. I don't consider myself a dummy by any means especially when it comes to movies but the flaw with Children of Men was some explanation to the main story. I don't understand WHY Julian's people killed her and were trying to take the baby? I don't understand WHY they just didn't go to the police, soldiers or government? Why would anyone want to stop this baby? They don't explain why the human project are the only people they trust with this baby. Without these key questions being answered their entire focus and thus the entire point of the film is somehow lost. You're watching these daring escapes, and nail biting chases and battles and you just keep thinking...why don't they just bring the baby to the authorities because this is a good, life saving, mankind changing event? They just don't explain it and I think it's a huge misstep for the creators of the film and stopped it from being a 10/10 for me.Clive Owen puts his brooding demeanor to perfect use as the disenchanted, former protester Theo Faron. Faron's back story and his reason why he ends up where he does unfolds throughout the film and he's an intense well written character and Owen definitely embodies the character and really makes it his own. He's the perfect anti-hero for a film of this type. Michael Caine is superb as Faron's best friend (perhaps relative of some kind.) Caine's character is the exact definition of what a hippie would be to us today and he's terrific. Clearly smart, trying to make something better of the world around him and dealing with his acoma'd partner/wife/sister? Many questions not answered. Julianne Moore is decent in a small part as the head of a rebel organization and Owen's ex-wife.The real magic of the film is not just one performance or one character but the combination of the film making and the brilliant cinematography that I mentioned before. This is a world unlike anything I've ever seen on screen because it looks so real and feels so dark and gritty and believable and the people you see in cages 'Illegal immigrants' look scared, hungry, volatile and it just sucks you into this world and you have so many questions and unfortunately very few of them get answered. Perhaps by watching the film numerous times and picking apart some of the stories people tell you could fabricate some history but I wanted the film to explain more to me and it doesn't. There is so much detail to the posters in the background, or something on Television that it is the type of film you could watch again and again and take something different from it every time. The battle scenes are just brilliant and so well done and they are no holds barred without any censoring or holding back. For a sci-fi fan you might find this almost too serious and thought provoking and, like me, you might want more out of it. But for those looking for something off beat, and different and diversely intelligent with a very honest look at society then Children of Men will likely blow you away. No matter how you look at it, you'll be stunned at it's depth and honesty. 8/10",8,2,10,11 January 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood's Powerful Epic brings out the best in everything
","Million Dollar Baby, if nothing else, brings forth the best performances you are likely to ever see out of both Eastwood as director and actor and Hilary Swank who really does perform above and beyond. Eastwood has been one of my favorite actors for a long time, more so his new work in the last 20 years...ie: Mystic River, True Crime, A Perfect World, Absolute Power and so on. I think he has come into his best work in his later years. When accepting his lifetime achievement award several years ago he stated that his best work was still ahead of him and that was the truth!! Million Dollar Baby is the rarely told story of a female Boxer who has the passion and heart but lacks the training. Eastwood plays a rough and tough former trainer turned cut man who is so passionate about boxing and protecting his boxers and when one of his prime boxers leaves him for another manager his sense of responsibility is quite shaken. Enter Swank as the tough as nails Maggie who won't give up on trying to get Eastwood to train her despite his insistence that he 'doesn't train girls.' Her insistence and his lack of faith in his boxers causes them to team up and their bond becomes unbreakable as her intense spirit and his rough exterior but faithful interior comes together. Enter the incomparable Morgan Freeman as Mr. Scrap, the former boxer who Eastwood trained back in their hey day. Scrap has leaved in Eastwood's gym and cleans the floors and is just kind of there to offer wisdom, even when it's not needed. Like it or not, they are all each other has.The story is powerful and the action is intense. The fight scenes hold nothing back and they are brutal and gory but you barely notice with all the amazing heart in this film. The story really has little to nothing to do with boxing but rather about these people...not just Maggie and Frankie and Mr. Scrap but even the other people around them from Maggie's family, to Danger the mentally handicapped boy who wants to box more than anything.Eastwood, Freeman and Swank perform their characters so beautifully. Granted Frankie played by Eastwood is the typical gruff and rough kinda character you'd expect from Eastwood but he plays it like no other could and he puts real soul into the character. Swank deserves all the praise as Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character is unique and interesting, and tough, and emotional, all at once and we really get to see where she came from, where she was going...we see her at her highs and lows and you can't stop watching her. Swank is brilliant!! Freeman's character adds real class and his narration of the story adds a grim bleakness to the story. It's a very sad and touching story from beginning to end and it's an instant classic that any lover of film must see. I don't know why I'm not smacking a 10 out of 10 on this...something holds me back from that but no one will be disappointed with this. Eastwood's direction is dead on, and the entire story is so gritty and dark but with this slight ray of light and hope and love and passion and dedication. It's one of the most unique films ever made. I admit I'm a huge boxing film fan...there doesn't seem to be many films that can go wrong when it places itself in the midst of boxing (I also more recently ADORED Cinderella Man), there is just something very passionate about boxing. This is well worth the watch for something very powerful and real. Definitely watch it!! 9/10",9,3,4,19 December 2005
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A dark twisted mystery that mystery lovers will draw to
","You can't make ten steps without seeing something about The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy. Recently (before seeing the film) I tried to start the first novel but found it oddly difficult to get through so I watched the film. The movie is everything that I've heard people say about the series. A dark twisted thriller on an isolated island and an eccentric family with a very dark secret. I have to imagine that this film does its very best to keep true to the source material which can be a challenge when translating a very popular book such as this. The film has the exact pace of a Television series. When I say this I mean that it reminds me of watching a great episode of a superb detective story...something like Columbo, or Father Dowling of the 80's. Obviously the film is much darker than any TV show could possibly be. The violence, gratuitous nudity, rape scenes and general foreboding setting is dark enough to make this a definite adult thriller. The chemistry between the characters, who are complete opposites of each other, is really excellent making them the perfect duo to solve the mystery.I certainly can't speak to any previous performances of the actors given they are Swedish. Michael Nyqvist plays reporter Mikael Blomkvist to near perfection. Sometimes an actor embodies his character to the point of becoming that character and I believe Nygvist does exactly that. I can't imagine anyone doing this role (even Daniel Craig.) He is perfect. Noomi Rapace is no different as the girl with the dragon tattoo Lisbeth Salander. She embodies the role and draws you into her twisted, emotionally disturbed character with a powerful ability that enhances her abilities to be a detective. Her character goes through a lot of changes throughout but she does it with such character and chemistry on screen. Nygvist and Rapace both as actors and their characters couldn't be more different and yet they have this amazing chemistry as partners. Lena Endre seems to play what is supposed to be a main character as Nygvist's lover and also his co-worker but honestly she is barely a supporting character. There is no depth or real reason for her to be there. However I feel like the same could be said for almost all the other supporting characters. Peter Haber, Sven-Bertil Taube, Marika Lagercrantz and Ewa Fröling while good don't really stand out amongst the powerful story and the powerful performances of the two leads. Taube is probably the best of the supporters but he doesn't get enough screen time to truly make it effective.I think its a real shame to not have director Niels Arden Oplev helm the American version of the film. He clearly has an incredible grasp of Stieg Larsson original novel. I know this because every word I heard someone ever say about the novel is precisely what the film showed me. I can't emphasize enough that this is a very dark film, there is no happy ending and this film clearly sets up the future of the trilogy. Lovers of mysteries or thrillers who are looking for something off the beaten path then you will love every minute of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Its almost too complex for its own good. My only wish is that perhaps they would have linked together the clues a little better. I mean, ultimately (in my opinion) Blomkvist and Salander never truly uncover any major clue that leads them to the killer but rather happen upon a string of lucky happenings. You can't get away from the effect this story has had on recent pop culture and if they do it right and stay true to the story the American version will be well worth seeing although it will never be as gritty as this, the original film to the book. 8/10",8,1,4,25 August 2010
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Brilliant, Clooney finally proves his stardom
","For the first time since Roseanne, George Clooney impressed me. I have thought since day one that his Hollywood stardom was rather unexplained and undeserving since I have never seen him do anything of any great value. Finally he blows me away by taking the helm as writer, director and actor in Good Night and Good Luck. Of all the Academy Award nominees I have seen this year (I have seen about ten) this is the first one that is truly deserving of Best Picture. Although I wouldn't go so far to say that it's the best movie of the year, it's definitely worthy of being hailed.Good Night and Good Luck literally transports you back to the time (1950's) of Edward R. Murrow, a CBS investigative reporter who takes on Senator Joe McCarthy on his stance of communism amongst the American People. It's the most time accurate film I have ever seen. You feel like you are right there in the newsroom with them all...watching the story unfold for the first time. The true brilliance in directing for Good Night and Good Luck is that it's almost literally a documentary but a riveting one with a storyline that draws you in. David Strathairn plays Ed Murrow. His quiet demeanor and his low brow commentary, his sheer seriousness brings the power and voice of Murrow to life. It's a very low key performance and at first you might think not worthy of any notable acclaim but upon reflection it's exactly what Murrow was. George Clooney plays producer and Murrow's close confidante Fred Friendly in his first (my opinion) acceptable role. He is low key as well, doesn't try to take the spotlight, does his lines quite well and lets the story unfold. He does a good job supporting Strathairn. Another notable appearance is Ray Wise as CBS Anchorman Don Hollenbeck who tries to support Murrow only to be targeted by McCarthy himself eventually leading to Hollenbeck's suicide. His quiet intensity is one of the best performances in the film as we watch the true repercussions of McCarthy's attacks on a real person. Frank Langella is also very good in his brief role as CBS Head man William Paley. Robert Downey Jr., and Patricia Clarkson round out the cast and they do a good job supporting the main story which is what they are there for. The brilliant part of the casting is the fact that infamous situations and news reports are NOT recreated or dramatized but the real footage is used and McCarthy is never dramatized, it's all very real footage which absolutely adds to the intensity and realism of the film.Good Night and Good Luck takes you and places you right into the newsroom while they take on McCarthy. It just feels so real and even though the story never really leaves the setting of the newsroom, it's still powerful and interesting and provocative. Clooney really goes above and beyond with this film and the nominations prove it and I must say that it's deserving. History fans, fans of film will truly appreciate Good Night and Good Luck. 9/10",9,1,2,15 February 2006
Big Hero 6," Disney does it again
","I don't think there is any question that Disney is the undisputed King of Animated. In many ways they always have been but in modern day they have taken that to a whole new level. They don't make cartoons for kids anymore but rather films that are animated that everyone can love. They've made animation a completely viable form of film making. The trailer for Big Hero 6 absolutely had me hooked. It reminded of Wall-E (one of the most brilliant animated films of all time) but also had that super-hero/Marvel vibe so I was intrigued. Big Hero 6 does not disappoint for a single second. The characters are as vibrant and fun and full of life as you can expect, the action is non-stop, the story is solid and they lay a foundation for future films though that seems unlikely given the time and effort and money they put into each one of their animated films. The only truly 'successful' franchise of Disney/Pixar Animation seems to be Toy Story which gets better and better each time around. Big Hero 6 is fresh and unique and a little bit dark but not dark enough to ruin it for older children. It has moments of intensity and some violence but nothing ten and up can't handle. Its a story of bravery, grief and loss and acceptance.Ryan Potter voices our hero...Hiro. One of the best things about Disney/Pixar films is their casting. Somehow they almost always absolutely nail these characters with their voices and Hiro is no exception. We become attached to this young genius and he's the perfect hero and leader for the Big Hero 6. Scott Adsit is the adorable, hilarious and heroic Baymax. He was simply amazing as I knew the character would be and Adsit captures it perfectly. TJ Miller, Jamie Chung, Damon Wayans Jr, Genesis Rodriguez all play significant parts and you completely lose yourself in their quirky and fun characters. Much like The Incredibles, Big Hero 6 gives you the opportunity to find your favourite hero and gravitate to them. The only downside is that we don't get to see a lot of them because there are so many characters. Regardless you will have your favourite and you'll want to see more of them. James Cromwell, Alan Tudyk and Maya Rudolph are just stupendous in their perspective roles as the adults in the film. Rudolph in particular has a small role that is just really terrific.The animation is nothing short of stunning. I saw the film in 3D which made no difference at all of course (yes I'm a 3D hater but wasn't given the option) but regardless of that the special effects and animation are excellent. The car chase scene when they are being pursued by the mask villain is just brilliant, edge of your seat stuff. The villain himself is a brilliant piece of work. He is memorable and visually very effective and yet never utters a word when he is in costume. He reminds me of a Disney classic Villain and a Sith Lord all rolled into one. If you think The Avengers is perhaps a little too intense for your youngster then Big Hero 6 is just as effective. They aren't well known heroes but that only adds to the originality of this story. I still wouldn't let my young youngsters watch it due to some intensity but that's your call. My major beef with the film (and its not really major) is the ending felt a little too neat and tidy. It was an okay ending on a truly great film. It felt a little hurried and a little too easy and perhaps they could have drawn on that a little more. Regardless Big Hero 6 is everything I expected from the studio and their latest entry. This is a must see for children, adults, superhero fans and anyone wanting a great time at the movies. 9/10",9,11,23,17 November 2014
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Did Anyone actually see this movie??
","We are in a world of CGI, and special effects that are created by computer rather than man. Superman will never fly on wire and crane, and UFO's will never attack intricately made recreations of cities and the earth. Instead producers, directors, and actors, spend millions on computer technology to create something that does not only not exist, but never even really happens. Do we ever stop to wonder why we don't see the absolute smash BLOCKBUSTERS of yesteryear? Where is Indiana Jones gone, or the old Star Wars? or the Lethal Weapon type action movies where you know those actors are rolling, jumping, shooting, and doing their own stunts or at the very least they have stunt doubles? Ladies and gentlemen, after that rant we rest on Resident Evil: Apocalypse. YES this is based on a video game, get over it. It doesn't make it a bad movie, it doesn't make it any different than based on a book, or a play, or a previously crappy movie. This movie was absolutely incredible, it was the best action movie, I have literally seen in years. The first Resident Evil was good...but it could not touch this unbelievable horrorfest, mixed with kick butt action, and a great cast.Best of all the CGI was apparently NIL and not necessary when you have the best action going.POSSIBLE SPOILERS***The story begins slightly before the end of Resident Evil 1, but doesn't only recap but fills in some blanks that were missed at the end. Some extended information so to speak. Alice (Milla Jovovich) stumbles out of captivity having been infected with a strain of the T-Virus (confused? Go rent the movie and/or game) This tiny detail enables Milla's character to become an awesome kick butt heroine with super hero strength, speed, and power. Plus she still wields guns like nobody's business. The Umbrella corporation has succumbed to the fact that their virus is loose in the city, and destroyed everything. Although they are trying to evacuate as much as they can, they realize there is no stopping it so they quarantine the city and begin preparation to obliterate the whole works and cover it up from the outside world. Then there is Alice, stumbling around inside the quarantine...not sure what to do or where to go, her former friend/partner Matt haven been taken away from her and brought into the 'Nemesis' program. All of us who had played the game knew where that was going. Enter the new characters. Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) makes her entrance as a rogue STARS agent. Locked in the city with a fellow STARS member, and eventually some other random citizen who stumbles upon them and turns into the comic relief of the film. Basically the story unfolds that if Jill, Alice, and the rest of her friends/team can search the city for the lost child of an Umbrella Scientist, that Scientist will help them out of the city before Umbrella nukes the whole works. What ensues is a kick-ass piece of action entertainment laced with the perfect works of a horror movie. Granted there are plot holes, how certain people get infected, and the duration of the infection before it turns people seems to change with each character, but plot holes are expected and acceptable in something that is just meant to be FUN!! This movie was FUN!! Awesome fun. First of all the weapons are just plentiful and cool!! And the moves when it was hand to hand was just perfection in fighting. I read some reviews that said the direction was choppy and inconsistent and I can't imagine where they got that from?? Granted, a few scenes seemed to be a little quick where you couldn't catch exactly what Alice was doing to these Zombies but even still you could sit back and just watch her whoop!! The one liners are a plenty and they are good, and funny, and several people even clapped in the theatre I was in. The director, Alexander Witt, who has worked on some of the most incredible action movies of the last ten years, knows his stuff and it's obvious. He knows exactly what makes a movie goer pump and he's got it all in here. The cast works together like magic, and Jill Valentine is given a dark, harsh edge that makes her mysterious and mean and a good guy all in one. I would like to have seen more of the STARS survive, but in all good horror movies, people must get picked off one by one and in their favor, more people survived then I thought would initially. That's what made this a unique horror movie was that in truth you didn't see the kills coming necessarily, and you couldn't say exactly who was gonna get it. The first Resident Evil felt almost Science Fiction but Witt took Resident Evil to it's horror roots and gave us a zombie flick to die for. Unlike Dawn of The Dead (which was good, but not great) Resident Evil has a story, a back story, a future. And frankly girls should LOVE this movie because it is one of the only, if not the only, where the lead characters are women and not just women, but women that lead, take out everything in their path and they are strong. They aren't utilized as sex symbols, or eye candy but rather actual characters who are gonna save everyone. Let's face it, Jovovich's Alice, or Guillory's Jill Valentine could make mince meat of Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft. Nemesis was an absolute awesome addition to Resident Evil and his declaration of 'STARS' which was used ONLY ONCE (thank you for not ruining it Mr. Witt) made me smile. He was a killer enemy...or nemesis if you will.Especially knowing Alice's emotional attachment. To have him then turn from her enemy to her ally, was brilliant and fun and added to the action. I hope he'll be back. Also it was cool to bring back the demon dogs which everyone loved from the first and Alice definitely got her vengeance another cool factor of Witt's story. Downsides...Jill Valentine tried her best to throw in the movements from the video game to little avail. For one thing they sucked in the game, let alone on screen. In that factor she didn't measure to Jolie's Lara Croft who perfected the noises and movements of the video gaming heroine. Certainly several plot holes made the movie implausible at parts, but perhaps one of the biggest reasons there was the length. The movie clocked in at an unfortunate ninety minutes. Everyone seems to be bitching about their attention spans and they want to pay 12 dollars for less than 2 hours of entertainment. I would have killed to see another half hour of those crazy zombies. All in all I don't know what people saw wrong with this film, it was possibly one of the best action movies I have ever seen. I pray there will be a third which there appears there will be although I am hesitant to think about what they will do with it. It probably will go sci fi which could kill the series but I just hope they'll think about it first. I don't compare this movie to anything else but itself as an action movie...I must give it what I thought and that's a strong 9/10....must see!!!",Null,0,0,16 September 2004
Brave," Good, fun, and some really great features, but not quite Pixar classic
","You have to feel sorry for Pixar. Considering they've created some of the most amazing animated films in history every eye is on them with everything they release. The review on the main page for Brave says everything I thought right in the title. This reviewer said 'Pixar's latest effort enchants us with stunning visuals, and charismatic characters, but misses the X factor that makes Pixar film's great.' (Joe Chadowski) He just nails exactly how I felt about this entire film. The Animation is stunning as always, the characters are fun and well performed and parts of the film are just simply enchanting which is what we have come to expect from Pixar. But there is something missing. I think that the story for Brave is definitely a little different. It isn't quite the adventure that we are used to from Pixar, most of it taking place in and around the castle in the film. It's a heavily moralistic tale about a mother and daughter. I felt like the beginning dragged just a little bit but then the middle got better and the ending was stupendous and pulls at your heart strings. There is just a certain something missing from the formula that makes this as big as previous Pixar films.The cast is superb. Kelly Macdonald brings a fierce determination and is simply fun as the free spirited Merida. Billy Connolly is brilliant and the role was just tailor made for him as Fergus, her father. Emma Thompson is terrific as Merida's mother before her transformation and the supporting main cast of Robbie Coltrane, Kevin McKidd and Craig Ferguson is just perfectly casted.I would have liked to have gotten a child's opinion on this film. Ultimately Pixar animation is gearing itself towards families and children and I feel like some kids might find this almost boring at times. I never found it boring because it felt more like a film made for adults. It had the ever popular adult humour that parents will laugh and the kids won't understand but I still felt like there was more here for adults than kids. Brave was very entertaining and I wanted to stay with it every minute because the characters were incredibly vibrant and the animation was top notch as it has ever been. The 3D was likely very impressive although I hate 3D. I absolutely recommend Brave because it still first rate animation but don't expect the stone cold classic we have come to expect from Pixar. It's a tow the line entry from them. 8/10",8,2,4,13 November 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Fun? Yes. But far from groundbreaking.
","Did I enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy? Absolutely. It was fun and cute and definitely one for sci-fi fans because it was a near-perfect blend of Star Wars meets Avengers (both Disney properties now so that makes some sort of sense.) Yet in the same vein I would hesitate to say that the film sits anywhere near either of those films. As with many comedies and action films the bulk of the movie can be seen in the trailer. The gags in Guardians of The Galaxy felt nearly stale I had seen them so many times in the trailer, there was not much new outside of that. The story was decent as was the performances and they did a decent job of establishing this group of outcast misfits forced to work together and find something meaningful as a make-shift 'family.' The movie was a lot of fun, it just didn't really floor me that way I had hoped. I have a great deal of respect for Marvel in what they've created and I am glad to see them start a new franchise with some connection to the Avengers Universe but this one felt a little bland when all was said and done. There was a ton of action scenes, space battles and hand to hand fights but they were just okay. I can't pinpoint why this wasn't 'amazing' for me, only that for me it just missed the boat a little.Chris Pratt is perfect for the role of Peter Quill aka: Starlord. His one liners and comedic timing works very well and he does a decent job of establishing some depth to his character. Its almost a little hard to take him seriously when the emotional scenes begin but he pulls it off. Zoe Saldana is also perfect for her role as vengeful assassin Gamora. Saldana and Pratt have good chemistry and some of the best action scenes are pulled off by her battling in hand to hand combat. Some comparisons could be made to her Avatar character but its a good performance nonetheless. I thought for a long while that Dave Bautista was a bad choice for this film. Wrestlers' moving into mainstream acting is becoming more common but in the beginning he seems cheesy and campy and then I began to understand that his character Drax is supposed to be exactly that. He doesn't understand sarcasm, takes everything literally and becomes ferociously protective of his new friends. He ended up being not so bad and he pulls it off. I still think he's a weaker member of the cast but he still impressed me. I don't even understand why Vin Diesel was cast in this film. I love the character of Groot...don't get me wrong...he was perfectly awesome but with one growly line in various tones, it could have been literally anyone behind the voice. You will never know its Diesel so in that regard I can't say he was good or bad. The star or person behind Groot is irrelevant. My favourite character and even performance was that of Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon. He has a definitive edge and a big heart and his character was insanely fun and funny. I could have done a whole movie with him. Cooper was spot on in his voicing of the CGI character. You could hardly even recognize him. Lee Pace was an extraordinary villain as Ronan and distinctly comparable to a Sith Lord from Star Wars. Still, he was definitely a villain worthy of an epic action flick. Watch for great supporting performances from Michael Rooker (he always plays the same role but heck he's good at it), Djimon Hounsou, Karen Gillan, John C. Reilly and Benicio Del Toro.This is one of those films where it doesn't matter what I say about it because its clear its already a HUGE hit for Marvel. Did it do it for me? Not entirely. Will I see it again? Sure! And I will watch sequels because it was fun. I just didn't think it was truly epic. Marvel continually sets a bar for itself and I personally didn't feel this reached that bar. I would never tell anyone it was terrible because it is very well done. The CGI was decent, the 3D was unnecessary as usual, the action and comedy was good...everything about it was good. I actually think director James Gunn was a bizarre choice to helm a major tent-pole franchise because he hasn't done a lot (although he did direct a film early in his career that I LOVED called Slither) and I'm interested to see if he can learn something and really impress me next time. Until then, I liked it but didn't love it. See it for yourself and make your own call. 7/10",7,9,16,7 August 2014
Evil Dead," Bloody, rip roaringly brilliant...the best movie experience I've had in...MONTHS
","This is a big milestone. I went through the entire year of 2012 without finding a single 2012 movie that I thought was a perfect 10. I don't hand them out lightly. A ten has to be near perfection for me, and something I know will be a favourite of mine for the rest of my life. I even hesitated to slap a ten on this but after a day, when I was still thinking about it and excited about when I could see it again...I know. This film was absolutely drop dead amazingly brilliant. They single handedly proved why remakes should and can exist. Some of my favourite horror films are remakes (Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, The Crazies) However, I'm not sure I have ever seen a remake done so well and so poignantly. It is disgustingly, viscerally violent. Does it go for sheer shock value? Absolutely and does it well. I read a great many negative reviews that called out the violence as 'disgusting.' Did you seriously not know what you were going in for? The trailers and the reviews all talked about its violence. I was well prepared for it and it delivered. But the brilliance is that this isn't what it was all about. The story which should be mostly a stereotypical horror flicks works so well and the cast handles everything so perfectly that you don't even realize that it really is just the same old as far as plot. There are definitive nods to the original without once letting it go to a 'campy' place. The humour is so dark that you will literally feel guilty even chuckling at anything so that makes it complete opposite from the original. And the one liners were absolutely EPIC!! 'Feast on this...' Every person in the very small cast is great with the exception of one person. And I don't blame her but rather the character. I will start with her. Elizabeth Blackmore plays Natalie and the character is completely useless. She has no back story like the rest of them and her purpose for being there is strictly to have five people in the cabin. However, she has one truly outstanding scene involving her arm and a meat saw...'nuff said. She just doesn't get any character development to really show off her ability. Jessica Lucas is truly great as a young doctor trying to help her friend detox in the cabin. She really hits her stride when she gets to showcase her demon side which is downright demented and she really shines. Lou Taylor Pucci plays the new-age-ish teacher who ultimately brings the demon out by reading the incantation in the book. Pucci's character is probably THEE toughest SOB I have ever seen in a horror flick. The man takes a beating, stabbing, nail gun, needle and just keeps on coming. He is a machine and such a great character with a touch of being sort of a scumbag in some aspects. Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy are drop dead amazing. They are our heroes so to speak playing brother and sister with a deep back story. You can feel their animosity towards each other and their broken relationship. They handle roles that could have been ho-hum and knock it out of the ballpark. They are riveting to watch and Levy gets the opportunity to really shine as the main possessed person and also a desperately detoxing drug addict.I actually thought going into this that Sam Raimi directed this but he was just a producer. However, whoever gave the reigns to Fede Alvarez who also worked on the script and is also a brand new director to feature films picked a talent that will be a force to be reckoned with. Usually a director with little experience make for a bad horror flick but clearly Alvarez is that diamond in the rough. He created something that is sheer brilliance, a horror masterpiece. All the pieces simply fall into place and make this an incredible horror movie experience. The film has it all. It does the cheap scares (the loud noises, or weird faces that make you jump), it has gore galore that make you wince in absolute agony, it has a solid story and an even more solid back story for its characters and the origin of the demon. The whole film practically is in the cabin and you would never want it any other way. Its claustrophobic and the pouring rain and ambiance they create is perfection. There are scenes in this movie that were jaw-dropping. Mia, near the end, in the rain holding the chainsaw was pure Gothic art. Many will disagree with me and frankly I don't care because I want everyone to know this was the best film I have seen in MONTHS...certainly years when it comes to a good horror flick. I watch a ton of horror and most of it is so awful that the only horror is trying to make it to the end. This vindicates the horror genre, and the remake genre. I can't wait to see it again and please horror fans do yourself a favour and see this yesterday!! 10/10",10,18,49,8 April 2013
The Imitation Game," Fascinating war story from a different perspective
","I wouldn't have rushed out to see this if it wasn't getting Oscar buzz. I am not a huge fan of Benedict Cumberbatch but I saw a trailer for it and was actually impressed that it intrigued me. The film is fascinating, a terrific story and very entertaining. In a weekend where I ended up inundating myself with 'Based on True Story' films inadvertently and this was by far the best of them. However, the film is as good as it is solely because of the amazing, outstanding performance by Cumberbatch. He has proved to me that he can really be astounding. But more on him in a moment. World War 2 stories are a dime a dozen but usually they do end up being very, very good. We are fascinated by stories of war for whatever reason. This is a different side of things as we never actually see the World War 2 front but Alan Turing and his team do more for the war than any other operation if the story is even partially accurate. Despite the fact that the story of the code breaking is the driving plot of the film, there is a far more important and fascinating story about a man who struggles to understand human interaction and fit in and find his place in the world when he is up against so many walls. It is a really great character study defined by an amazing performance.The film itself is good but the star Benedict Cumberbatch is mesmerizing. He is well deserved in getting an Oscar nomination which seems to be the popular opinion. He just captures this character and draws you into his eccentric personality. Matthew Goode is decent in his role as Turing's colleague and eventual friend Hugh Alexander. Goode's biggest hurdle is that he has to stand up to Cumberbatch so he doesn't quite get as noticed. I am not a Keira Knightley fan, I know she's been in a lot of great movies but I usually find her very irritating. However, she actually does alright in this film. Her role is mostly small and she has the proper chemistry with Cumberbatch which is this awkward friendship that seems to work. Matthew Beard, Allen Leech, James Northcote and Mark Strong all round out the main supporting cast in decent but not spectacular roles. Its a small cast but ultimately this is the Cumberbatch show and he shines in it so this is definitely a vehicle for him.Director Morten Tyldum has a great story on his hands here and he got very lucky with such a strong leading performance. The Imitation Game is a very interesting story but really its just a good movie. Not an amazing one. The single reason why this is getting so much intense recognition and Oscar buzz is because of Cumberbatch. Have I said that enough? Remember that I am not a huge fan of his so for me to constantly gush about him is an even bigger deal. This is definitely a great bio pic and drama and a fascinating film for anyone who loves a character study or a World War 2 film that is completely different than others out there like it. I can't see this film taking home any nominations outside of Best Actor but it is still a great movie to check out. 8/10",8,4,10,11 January 2015
The Evil Dead," The patriarch of epic indie Horror
","I literally laugh out loud when I hear someone say...The Evil Dead? That movie is terrible. OF COURSE IT IS!! It is deliciously, brilliantly terrible. It is gory, and even creepy at times and then flips flawlessly over to being downright hilarious. But in my opinion the true brilliance of The Evil Dead is when you look at it from a film making perspective...which I don't usually like to do...but this movie was essentially done on a shoestring budget with hands on special effects and gore. The cast went through gruelling conditions to bring this movie to life (no pun intended) It is the quintessential indie film. It proved and still proves that a horror film made independently by then 'unknowns' can still be immensely successful. The story is incredibly simplistic, for the most part it is said that Sam Raimi didn't have a real script but had all the ideas in his head. There is nothing about this movie that you can say is 'brilliant' except for the sheer fact that it was made by an incredibly talented group of young people. The script is silly, the gore is gratuitous and over the top, everything about it is simple but the film is legendary and incredibly fun to watch for horror fans.Ellen Sandweiss, Richard DeManincor, Betsy Baker and Theresa Tilly are all okay in their roles. They are a little campy in the beginning and a little stiff in line delivery but then once they're all possessed and part of the 'evil dead' is when they all really shine especially Sandweiss and Tilly. They put their heart and soul into the movie and basically signed themselves over to Raimi and let him do whatever it was he did and they deserve kudos for that. Did they make or break the movie? No. Honestly they felt like fodder for the demons and didn't really stand out. This is perhaps the reason why The Evil Dead made Bruce Campbell a legend. We all know him now as the King of Camp but in The Evil Dead he is truly giving his very best 'serious' performance. Yes some of it is laughable but he is so dedicated and fun to watch and there is absolutely no doubt that he has this charisma on screen that makes him riveting. He carries this movie on his back and does so perfectly. The guy is covered from head to toe with every manner of disgusting body fluid that you can imagine and he looks classy while doing it.The Evil Dead is the most fun because it tries so hard to be serious. Those who are squeamish will certainly find the gore hard to watch. Those of us who are die hard horror fans will see the dark humour in how over the top everything is. But it is is a horror film through and through. The atmosphere that Raimi created (again on virtually nothing) is brilliant. The entire setting in the cabin, the dark and creepy woods, the infamous 'woods raping scene' is all simply twisted and disturbing and even the humour in this film is (I think) entirely unintended and comes from watching these guys have a lot of fun making a horror film. But unlike many independent horror film makers (especially nowadays) this group of people headlined by Raimi and Campbell are incredibly talented and went on to much bigger things. The Evil Dead is not for everyone but it is a classic without a doubt and true horror fans and fans of film making have to appreciate it for what it is and what it has become. The remake currently in theatres is stone cold brilliance...but for a variety of different reasons. 8.5/10",8,1,3,17 April 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino Scores...finally!!
","I admit, I was very determined to NOT like Kill Bill. I am not a Quentin Tarantino fan by ANY means!! His film making is egotistical, and annoying and he works far too hard to make the film unique, original, and usually confusing. But the general public seems to like his films for his gratuitous violence and pointless everything else that is taboo. Nonetheless he manages to mainstream his film enough to make a decent action movie that the film goers loved. So I went into this film expecting very little and it was awesome!! First of all someone else I am NOT a fan of Uma Thurman but she turns in a brilliant performance and likely a lasting classic film character in 'The Bride.' The film is all about simple, horrible, blood thirsty revenge. The simplistic plot makes the film easy to watch despite Tarantino's directing style which still shows through. The entire main cast really creates lasting characters for film history. Not only does Thurman turn in a blood thirsty disturbing role as The Bride, but we have her main adversary O-Ren Ishii played by Lucy Liu, who up until now has also never turned in an impressive role so it's fair to say that if anything Tarantino brings out the best in sub par actors. The opening battle between The Bride and Vernita Green set the tone for what Kill Bill is about. Although not a lot of plot has been given about their backgrounds or the circumstances of The Bride's attempted murder, enough is given to keep it interesting. We are also introduced to some of the future battles and characters that will be covered in Volume Two and they were interesting enough to make you want to know what's going to happen.Strangely enough the worst and best part of this film is Tarantino's direction. His positive unique style comes through in the incredible choreography of the battles, the intense over the top violence, and the less than credible bloody scenes that seem so unrealistic that it's meant to be that way. At the same time you are bombarded with Tarantino's forced uniqueness, the scenes made from Japanimation, the annoyingly jumpy plot line, and the oddball small little admissions, which may or may not be explained away in the second volume (I have yet to see.) No matter what anyone who wants a simple hack fest with loads of blood and over exaggerating violent scenes, this one is worth seeing plus it will be a cinema classic no matter what. Looking forward to volume 2!! 8.5/10",8,0,3,23 August 2005
Saw II," Yes there was BLOOD!! BRILLIANT!!
","Be still my heart, this series is GETTING BETTER!! And an even bigger rarity is that people seem to agree!! Now it seems to me that the original SAW which was drop dead brilliant got harpooned by reviewers on here for the most part. Now the second installment comes out and is faring much better with the crowds it seems which is awesome and completely worthy!!! Where to begin with this incredible sequel. First off new, and very young director Darren Lynn Bousman does an incredible job of capturing exactly the original setting, feel and emotions of the original. The world of SAW is so dark, twisted, gritty...it's like being in the mind of the Jigsaw killer. Bousman does that flawlessly and still brings over the sheer brilliant twisted mind that existed in the original. A real life criminologist could spend years examining 'The Jigsaw Killer' as his motives and crimes are so real. The cast in this sequel has improved 10 times over. The shoddy rather campy acting of the original has been left behind by some real strong performances starting with Donnie Wahlberg as the detective being pointed out by the killer, and also fighting to save the life of his troubled son who has been kidnapped by the Jigsaw killer. Dina Meyer returns as the detective in charge of the Jigsaw case, and I can't honestly say I remember her performance in the original but she was good in her small role. The rest of the cast was the captives and this is really where SAW II becomes original compared to the first one. The first one focused on two main victims and a handful of lesser ones whereas in this one you have six or seven captives in a house where the game resides.I still think SAW II made some errors, as they did in the original. First of all I think there was something lost when they did more than just a couple victims. There was something eerie and downright terrifying and claustrophobic about only have two victims trapped in a small room. Although each character trapped had a very specific personality trait and they all had their own ways of showing terror, I think there was too many. It also leaves the door open for the question...WHY?? Why did the Jigsaw killer take all those people when all he needed was the detective's son?? Sure they all had a connection and it made for some wicked death scenes but they were unnecessary. Right off the bat we have the capture of the Jigsaw Killer, he is unveiled so to speak whereas in the original he was a total mystery. Any time you unveil a mysterious character you're going to leave behind a certain feeling with the audience and I think that happened a little bit here BUT....Tobin Bell, who did play in the first film, is a deadly awesome killer. He spends the whole film bound to a wheelchair and yet is still frightening, maniacal, and evil. Everything is part of his game and you really get caught up in it.With the minor plot holes, and a few odd choices you have what's left which is still one of the best horror films ever made hands down, and what is turning out to be one of the best horror franchises. The deaths in the film is gory and there is LOADS of blood. It was fun sitting in the theater listening to everyone gasp at the same things every time. This guy is beyond sick and twisted and the ideas they came up with for the traps and the 'game' is indeed still original and horrifying. The pit of needles!! OH MAN!! The hand trap that in order to remove your hands, it would...well...remove your hands. Shot in the eye, bat to the head, poisonous gas that causes blood to vomit from the mouths of it's victims and all the while The Jigsaw killer insists 'I've never killed anyone.' Brilliant!!! They even managed to tack on ANOTHER surprise ending although I'm still not sure I particularly am fond of it, KUDOS to them for doing another fantastic ending that keeps you guessing. On top of all this they did something I think is a sequel absolute MUST!! Not many do it though. They brought back three members of the previous film ANNNND brought the film full circle BACK TO the room where the original victims were held and tortured...OH IT GAVE ME SHIVERS to see that cold sterile room again!! Ladies and gentlemen, you must see this film and most of all you must see the original and then this one...any horror fans will relish in this unique intelligent horrifying film. I compared the first to Seven which is no small feat considering I believe Seven to be the greatest psychological horror ever made. I continue to see the comparisons in this follow up which was even better than the original for once!! It's a trip to hell in a game that seemingly can't be won and if you do win...well it could still be a loss. This could possibly be the first horror sequel to be better than it's original. Go see this film RIGHT NOW!! 9/10",9,0,1,30 October 2005
Here Comes the Boom," Fun, simple, feel good, uplifting and clean...what more can you ask for?
","I suppose my expectations for this film could be described as mediocre. I hadn't heard too much about it and the trailers looked okay. I began to hear some feedback that was somewhere between 'awful' and 'yah it was okay.' So to say that Here Comes The Boom exceeded my expectations is a sincere understatement. This movie was fantastic! Yes it was cookie cutter, it was the stereotypical, near predictable sports hero Rocky underdog type movie. That doesn't make it bad at all. I love a lot of those types of movies. They still have to make it interesting with good characters and they do that and beyond. It was just so nice to sit and watch a movie that was a little bit of comedy, a little bit of romance, drama and quite a bit of action. It was also nice to watch something that turned out to be clean family fun!! It does have some pretty violent fight scenes so certainly viewer discretion is advised but no nasty toilet humour, sex talk, bad language or anything like that. It was believable and sweet and the cast were all so good together. The chemistry was just about perfect.I like Kevin James, not love him but like him a lot. He definitely has some genuine lovable qualities and he proves in this movie that he can carry a movie effortlessly. This isn't his usual silly slapstick comedy and he really puts forth a great effort and actually is very believable as a 42 Year old fat biology teacher that trains to be a UFC fighter. He makes you root for him!! Henry Winkler who is always amazing (and looks incredible for his age by the way!) is absolutely perfect as the music teacher whose job is on the line. Winkler and James are wonderful together and will bring tears to your eyes more than once. Winkler balances drama and comedy like a seasoned professional which he is. Salma Hayek was, in my opinion, a bit of an odd choice for the romantic lead. She is okay and her and James are okay together but the movie is so good and I feel like a better female lead might have made this all the more together. Out of everything I didn't buy their romance and didn't feel invested in it. Bas Rutten was simply fantastic. He was a scene stealer and was just so terrific in his role. He was hilariously funny and yet really great in the more dramatic scenes. They couldn't have found anyone better for this role. Plus him and James were simply awesome together. The supporting cast were all great with honourable mention to Shelly Desai in an adorably sweet role that will have you laughing and then crying, and Charice as a student of James' that is his support system in his classroom.It didn't surprise me when I saw director Frank Coraci helmed this film. He also directed the absolutely amazing 'Click' which is probably one of the greatest comedic-dramas I've ever seen. He knows a good script, cast and story and just knows how to bring out the best in each and every scene. This film will get the typical complaints about it because people hate to just let themselves enjoy something and be uplifted. Yes you have seen this before or at least something similar but that doesn't make it less enjoyable! It is a genre in and of itself, the 'underdog' sports movie and this one does it extremely well. Sit down with the family and laugh and smile and cry because this movie will make you do all of the above. Loved it! 9/10",9,4,7,5 February 2013
Clash of the Titans," Ridiculously stone cold action flick---nothing more and nothing less...pure entertainment
","There is plenty to say about Clash of The Titans. Is it historically/mythologically accurate? Well who cares for one...I mean it never was set out to retell in accurate details the religious beliefs of ancient Greece and if you're going to see it for that then you need your head examined. Films like this especially were made for pure and utter entertainment. That means if they take liberties with familiar characters or legends they are simply trying to put a new spin on things instead of dragging out the same old bit. The story for Clash of The Titans exists but barely matters and is only a surface story because this film thrives on absolutely mind blowing special effects, brutal and impressive battles and red blooded male heroes. Under different circumstances this style of film could really belly up and turn out to be boring and over shot but instead this recipe works whole heartedly for this film. You will sit there and your jaw will drop at the incredible effects and battles which there are a few key moments in the film that are nothing short of stunning. I did not see this in 3D and don't particularly wish to mostly because I think the 3D for this film was forced in at the last minute and the special effects are amazing enough with cheap gimmickry.A star has risen...Sam Worthington had an incredible 2009 having starred in Terminator 4, and of course the biggest film of all time Avatar. And now 2010 gets kicked off with the first really big flick of the mid-Season blockbusters. I don't find Worthington is really star status...yet. I don't dislike him I just find him a little dull sometimes. He has an intensity about him but its a quite intensity, and not quiet like Bruce Willis but truly under the radar and that could hurt him. Still he leads the cast well and pulls off the underdog hero very well. Rising as a Hollywood legend Liam Neeson plays the god amongst gods Zeus. Its not a huge role but he definitely commands screen presence and instantly ups the ante on the cast. He is terrific. Ralph Fiennes is brilliant as Hades. He does an amazing job and the only thing I can say about the role is that I wish there was more to it and I wish there was more scenes between him and Neeson as enemies and brothers at odds. He is a terrific villain but sadly underused. Alexa Davalos is lovely but mostly a third tier character with little depth to her. The supporting cast that is Worthington's small army are terrific but mostly undeveloped characters meant to support only.Director Louis Leterrier is becoming a force in Hollywood. He did nearly the same thing with The Incredible Hulk reboot in 2008...great special effects, decent story, all entertainment. However he did great action and a good story for Danny The Dog (his first film) which I greatly recommend. He was ideal for directing this. There were some definite mistakes in the film. First of all the most impressive creature, battle and special effect was the incredible build up and appearance of the Kraaken. The unfortunate part is how incredibly fast it is defeated and vanishes. You want to pause and rewind just to see the creature. They spent just a little bit too much time on the scorpion battles (as incredibly cool as they are) and not enough time on the final battles. Clash of The Titans could have been a Lord Of The Rings sized epic but instead they put it together for sheer entertainment at a reasonable length and cut out what would have made it story based. Unfortunate perhaps but the entertainment is non stop and you won't be disappointed but please don't see this with expectations of mythologically enhanced story. 8.5/10",8,2,4,8 April 2010
Jurassic World," The Epic Juggernaut returns but without some of the magic
","2015 is actually a HUGE year for movies. Some of my most anticipated films are hitting theatres or have already hit and this was one of them. Jurassic Park was one of the films that gave me my adoration for movies. It took a casual fun thing and turned it into an obsession for me. The dark theatre, the stunning special effects, that amazing body-tingling score, and the terror of being trapped in a park with dinosaurs. Jurassic Park is easily one of the ten best films ever made in my books. The two sequels were also decent (I don't care what anyone says)...I actually think Jurassic World is lowest in the series. That's not to say it isn't entertaining and I was thrilled to experience the world again. The biggest problem is that Jurassic World is a sequel that presents itself like a remake. Many of the scenes feel carbon-copied from the original (which would be okay if this were a remake.) It doesn't have nearly the intensity or thrill that the original had and it isn't even as dark as the original was. It just feels like it is lacking some of the magic from the original and like rather than setting itself apart, it is simply building and borrowing from the original. I also think the film lacked greatly by having none of the original cast return. I felt like I was aching to see Dr. Sadler, Malcolm, Lexi, Tim...anyone from the original.Despite that, the new young cast was very good. Ty Simpkins and Nick Robinson were both quite good in the role of brothers brought to the island to spend time with their Aunt. Neither one of them had the sheer terror and naivety that the original kids had but they definitely hold their own in the film. The adult cast was really lacking in my books. I'm not sure I fully understand the sudden instead stardom of Chris Pratt. He is decent and I like him but I don't think he has the chemistry of big stars of movies past. He is good in this but is he the ultimate hero? Do we care about him that way we did about Dr. Grant in the original? Is he almost too invulnerable? There was just something not quite right about him. Still everyone loves the guy and he is Hollywood gold right now. I've always been very ho-hum about Bryce Dallas Howard since The Village. I feel like she overacts and really tries too hard. This sort of role demonstrates that very well. She is aggressive and unlikable and the romance between her and Pratt is literally forced down our throats. She is not right for the film and she sort of drags it down significantly. Vincent D'Onofrio is perfect as the villain of sorts. D'Onofrio has that character actor quality that really makes him great. Irrfan Khan was also fantastic in a horribly small role that should have been far more significant. Jake Johnson also plays a great role that is too small and BD Wong returns as the only returning cast member in a character that is completely changed from the original bit part he had in the first film.Now I know this film is shaping up to be one of the biggest of all time so who am I to say anything bad about it. But how on earth do you hand one of the biggest franchises of all time into the hands of a completely inexperienced director? Colin Treverrow is a viral success that somehow gets this put on his plate. Now his flagship film was one of my favourite of 2012 (Safety Not Guaranteed) but this is a different ball of wax entirely. The film lacks that must-have epic Jurassic Park feel and some of that has to be because of his inexperience. That body-shivering score I mentioned is hardly used which also hurts the experience. Maybe Jurassic World isn't for me or for my generation that grew up with the original but rather a new generation and maybe they (obviously) love it. I'm glad I got to revisit the franchise and I will be back for more but lovers of the original will certainly find plenty to be disappointed with. The return of the original T-Rex was easily the best part of the film and the special effects were handled very well and its a fun time at the movies so I will give it points for that. 7.5/10",7,1,6,7 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," Unfortunate happenings made this one more of a miss in my books
","First of all my beautiful fiancée put me in the credits...how cool is that? I'm talking about the Blu-Ray release of Paranormal Activity where they allowed fans to write in and they added their names to the credits. Anyways something I'm sure you'll look into. There were some definite extenuating circumstances that made Paranormal Activity a little more like a dud to me. While I enjoyed the basic ideas behind it and some genuinely creepy scenes, and I enjoyed the low quality angle like Blair Witch or Cloverfield. However, I knew, as many did, going in that this wasn't real, they weren't even trying to pretend it was real. Secondly there were three girls in the theater that giggled and screamed and were downright stupid through the whole thing so thank you ladies for ruining my experience. On top of both of those I felt like both stars in the film really weren't giving their all. It felt like they were 'performing' which takes away from the aspect of this being a true story or all too real or anything like that. It just didn't fit. And finally there was a lot of hype around this movie by the time I saw it. People were raving about it so it probably inadvertently raised my expectations.Micah Sloat is the doting boyfriend who is also the unbeliever at first. Boy will he get his just come-uppins. Sloat is significantly better than his female counterpart but still doesn't really show off any terrific acting ability. He's new to the big screen so I guess this will likely help a budding acting career. Katie Featherston is his girlfriend and the one being haunted. She was good in some scenes and then other scenes she just came across as really phony. She got some of the creepiest scenes (like simply standing over his side of the bed for hours) but that still didn't really take a lot of effort. The two of them together however are really terrific. They have great chemistry and work well together, lucky for them. I personally would have worked overtime to find the perfect 'psychic' but instead they found Mark Fredrichs. As the psychic come to try and help the couple which he doesn't...at all...he doesn't even try but rather runs away every time. He doesn't even come across as believable.I'm not trying to harp on the creation of newcomer Oren Peli because he wrote and directed and the movie made millions, tens of millions and already has a sequel slated (which I will see!) However, the movie was sloppy, and it seemed to win over millions of people but I saw it for more of what it was which was a run of the mill, not strongly performed movie that tries to make you believe in its reality. Now all this being said it takes some talent to completely and utterly send a creepy chill through you by moving a bedroom door and nothing else. But that is one of the creepiest scenes in the movie. Add in that her behavior throughout the film and it will give you some shivers. But don't believe ALL the hype because it isn't the best horror movie of the year, there are zero special effects and all the chills are done cheaply which only work some of the time. Overall you'll end up seeing it because of its popularity but I think you'll see what I saw. Average for what it is. 7/10",7,1,2,2 February 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A dark remake more for the reminiscent adults
","Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory is now considered something of a classic in film for Children. Everyone seems to remember seeing the original and it was with these memories that I went to see the Tim Burton recreation Charlie and The Chocolate Factory. If Burton is known for anything it's dark, sometimes twisted comedy and The Chocolate Factory seems like a no brainer story for him. I have never read the novels by Dahl but I understand Burton's version is much more true to the book.Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is the story of a young boy and his impoverished family barely surviving. They live in a small European type village where the claim to fame is the infamous Willy Wonka's Chocolate factory where Charlie's Grandfather used to work until a mole that was stealing Wonka's secrets caused Wonka to shut everything down and close up the factory. It was years before suddenly Wonka started making his wonderful candies and chocolate again but without the help of anyone it seemed. Out of the blue Wonka makes a worldwide announcement that he is placing only five Golden Tickets in his Wonka bars for five lucky boys or girls and that will give them the privilege of being shown around the infamous Chocolate factory by Wonka himself. Not only that but one of those lucky five will get a great prize. Charlie is thrilled about the idea of getting one of those tickets but rather discouraged knowing that he only gets one Wonka bar a year on his birthday and therefore only once chance at the ticket. He opens his birthday bar with his family anxiously looking on but gets nothing. They all watch as rich, stuck up, snobby greedy kids win the tickets one by one. Charlie's Grandfather surprises Charlie with a dollar to buy another Wonka bar and Charlie does, but again he gets nothing. All hope seems lost as there is only one golden ticket left. After a false ticket surfaces Charlie comes across a ten dollar bill in the street and immediately buys one more candy bar. He slowly unwraps it and sure enough Charlie has found the last Golden ticket. Inviting his Grandfather to join him, he enter the factory with four other children and their parents. Wonka is odd, weird, eccentric but introduces them to a mysterious, beautiful and odd world of chocolate and candy and a mysterious race of beings called Oompa Loompas. As they tour the factory Wonka looks back on his childhood and we see a little of what made him become what he is. As the tour continues each child is subjected to their moral weakness so to speak and it causes them to meet their dramatic exit from the factory (none are hurt only extradited), until only Charlie is left. From process of elimination Charlie will be offered the greatest gift ever but by turning it down he will not only change his own life but the life of Willy Wonka as well.First off Johnny Depp is brilliant...bring on the little Golden statue cause so far he is the deserving one. I really wasn't sure when I saw the commercials, it seems like a rather TOO odd performance but instead he is brilliant, and funny, and completely off the wall in a very real way. Gene Wilder may always be Willy Wonka but Johnny Depp creates a whole new look to the part. Freddie Highmore who was completely brilliant opposite Depp in Finding Neverland continues his rise to stardom playing a very emotional and touching role as Charlie. David Kelly as Charlie's Grandpa also does a very good job, everyone adds their personality to the film. Burton creates a beautiful, and cartoony but still dark world inside the factory. Julia Winter (Veruca Salt-The Spoiled rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teavee the spoiled violent genius), Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop-The Greedy over eater), Annasophia Robb, (the horrible little over achiever Violet Beauregarde)all do an amazing job in their respective roles and we love seeing them meet their rather disturbing ends, although the film always make it explicitly clear that the children are not being harmed. The film is an awesome adventure. However I can't quite explain the 'G' Rating because I wouldn't want my young kids seeing this film?? The original was a little dark but musical and more light hearted. Burton doesn't put a lot of light heart into this one with the exception of Charlie and his morality and family values. Wonka himself is off the wall weird and dark and there are numerous expressions that might be over the head of little ones but adult aimed nonetheless. Danny Elfman's familiar dark music adds to the atmosphere. It certainly makes the film all the more entertaining for adults and I am sure any fan of the original will be delighted to see a more mature update. This is definitely worth seeing!! 8/10",8,4,6,8 August 2005
Mission: Impossible II," The Butchering John Woo accomplished
","I might be speaking blasphemy here and probably get a horde of angry emails but I don't care it has to be said...I don't believe director John Woo is much different than Hollywood hated Uwe Boll...complete with a host of video game licenses to their name. While it's true I've never seen any of Woo's work from his early days which is touted as action art but I have seen Windtalkers, Paycheck, Face/Off, Broken Arrow and of course Mission Impossible 2. Woo brings to the table an incredible unique style...TOO unique. He has to make everything with John Woo stamped all over it and tries to make action...art and it's not!! Action is action...it's adrenalin pumping, edge of your seat, holler for the hero...you don't care whether their movements and choreography is beautiful and in the process of making this unique piece of art John Woo lost the magic that was Mission Impossible.Tom Cruise returns as nice guy secret agent, with a bit more of an edge, Ethan Hunt. Hunt definitely is tougher, grittier and yet falls deeply in love in this Mission. He still plays the role well and no one fulfills the screen presence like Cruise. The hair was wild!! Almost unexplainable?? The long, greasy locks was not very becoming and certainly cut back on the clean cut Ethan Hunt we knew from the original. Although tougher and grittier it just felt like his character wasn't as smart and throughout all the wild stunts and fights which are practically 100% done in slow motion, he loses something in his character. Dougray Scott takes the helm as the bad guy, Sean Ambrose. Instead of being Ethan's mentor, this time he is his stand in for many missions and he's tired of being in the shadow. Scott is decent and plays the bad guy well but in all honestly he doesn't stand a chance against Cruise. He never poses a viable threat and you just sit back and wait for him to get his butt kicked. Thandie Newton plays the Mission Impossible girl, Nyah Nordoff-Hall. Ethan falls madly in love with her at first sight, completely out of the blue and then must protect her as she goes deep undercover with her former lover Sean Ambrose. Despite horrible reviews Newton is not AWFUL...she's a million miles from great but she's okay. Her and Cruise have some strong sexual tension but otherwise the romantic chemistry is fleeting. She's kind of whiny and annoying for someone who is supposed to be a strong female and a brilliant thief. Ving Rhames returns as Hunt's partner Luther Stickell and his role is a little bigger this time around which is a welcome addition. He adds to the cast nicely. Richard Roxburgh plays Hench man and bad guy Hugh Stamp. His role is pretty quiet but effective and in fact he might have made a better major villain than Dougray Scott. His suspicious nature and his brutal facial expressions are fun to watch and even though Scott does get the better of him several times it's not believable and you keep waiting for Roxburgh to take him out. And finally giving Mission Impossible that touch of experience and class that Jon Voight and Vanessa Redgrave did to the original is Anthony Hopkins as Hunt's boss. Despite being a relatively small role he has some very effective and memorable lines. 'To lie to a man and sleep with him, she's a woman, she has all the training she needs.' 'This is not Mission Difficult Mr. Hunt, it's Mission Impossible, difficult should be a walk in the park for you.' It's unfortunate he didn't have a bigger role.Parts of Mission Impossible were kept in tact in order to make it as good as the original but in my humble movie going opinion it was the decision of bringing director John Woo on board that made the film nearly a joke. Fortunately with such strong actors, and some decent action scenes the film was pulled from obscurity but just barely. What should have and could have been one of the best fights in action film history between Ethan Hunt and Sean Ambrose in the end turned into some sort of choreographed dance routine done in slow motion with flowing clothing and hair and some sort of half-assed wrestling maneuvers that looked like it hurt them more than the other guy they were doing it too. The idea of a virus being stole was good and also opened up the window for a near replay of Hunt's daring theft in the original and although it wasn't bad as Hunt narrowly dives down into fan shafts, it just didn't come across as well. Mission Impossible II is okay and it's worth seeing if not just because the first was so incredible and hopefully the third will put this series back on track but so far number II definitely falls short of what the original was. The action is less, the romance is overwhelming and a little hokey, the fight scenes are far too dance like and the plot is still a little muddled and you wonder often what's going on. Add into that the cast just wasn't as strong as the original and you have a sub par sequel. Good luck next time!! 6.5/10",6,1,2,20 April 2006
World Trade Center," Did anyone expect anything less than true greatness??
","There are two sides to this tale. Either People are gonna hate it...I think those people go to this film expecting to see a sensationalized picture about a tragedy complete with explosions, action, and nail biting scenes but all done with a 300 million dollar budget and Nicholas Cage with guns strapped around him. Of course you're going to be disappointed. And then there is likely the other half of the people who would be scared to say otherwise because it deals with such an intense and open wounded topic of an event that happened only five short years ago and completely changed the world and the United States as we knew it. I can only promise that I am reviewing this film completely unbiased and honest to goodness sincerity for what I thought of this film...and I thought it was the most moving and important film in history...PERIOD!! September 11th, 2001 did change everyone's life because something so incredibly tragic has never happened that close to home for North Americans. It wasn't the most tragic event or horrifying event by any means (although it ranks up there) but for us...things like that don't happen close to home. Sitting there and watching Oliver Stone's absolutely breath taking labor of sincere love for his country was truly what brought tears to my eyes. He didn't for ONE SECOND sensationalize the event. Although some say he tip toed and walked on egg shells to avoid certain content...is that his fault?? Or is it another example of him being patriotic, understanding and sincere. Oliver Stone didn't make 9/11 a taboo subject...society did. Society is the one who nurses the open wound regarding this incident and Oliver Stone makes a beautiful and downright thought provoking and depthy epic about this horrible event.Nicholas Cage gives hands down the performance of his career as John McLoughlin, the Port Authority Sergeant in charge of other officers going into Tower one of the World Trade Center following the first plane striking. Cage's performance tops out anything I've ever seen performing 95% of this film buried underneath rubble and with facial expressions and tone of voice and he moves you every time he speaks. Oscar!! Michael Pena plays Will Jimeno, soon to be new Father buried beside McLoughlin. Pena is more vocal than Cage and carries the story and really draws you into his character. He is quite simply put BRILLIANT!! Oscar!! Maria Bello, who is a favorite character actress of mine plays strong in spirit wife of McLoughlin Donna. She has all these kids to protect and stay strong for while she desperately realizes she may never see her husband again whom she feels she hasn't loved to her capacity. Controversial Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Pena's pregnant wife Allison Jimeno and does a terrific job. She appears to be less strong than Bello's character but in fact is holding her whole life together with thoughts of her husband. Both couples separated and with husbands buried beneath the rubble are opposite ends of the same story. The presence of Gyllenhaal is testament to Stone's effort to NOT create a political story but one of survival and love because there is no political statement made whatsoever in this story. (Gyllenhaal made comments following 9/11 regarding the U.S. knowing about the attacks beforehand.) On a smaller scale Michael Shannon plays rescuer and former marine Dave Karnes. Although without a doubt a complete hero Karnes comes across as a little creepy and almost like a rebellious vigilante at first which kind of sticks out of place.I don't mean to leave out or discount anyone other performances in this film because they are all so well done but these are the main characters that hold this film together. Stone's epic feel to the film and the meticulous recreation of New York before and during the World Trade Center attacks is nothing short of brilliant. His establishing shots of these workers going about their average day with no idea what lies ahead. The fact that he never once shows the towers getting hit or actually collapsing at first bothered me. I mean how can you make the definitive World Trade Center film and not show that but this film is truly from the perspective of the rescue workers and it shows what they saw or heard or felt as the towers were hit and that makes it brilliant!! This is hands down the absolute and ultimate tribute to everyone involved in 9/11 and bravo to Stone who is back on top following the non-success of Alexander. This is one film that you will NEVER forget and you CANNOT leave the theater without feeling something completely different for the entire situation. I say again...the most moving film of all time PERIOD!! Everyone MUST see this film. It's not about politics in ANY way, it's not about sensationalized movie making, it is an epic picture, brilliantly shot, entertaining, breath taking, captivating, non stop story that will draw you in and leave you completely broad sided with it's sheer epic quality. Is it entertainment?? Sure I suppose in some way but it wasn't made with that in mind. I truly believe Stone saw the capacity for a story about human nature and spirit and strength and it will make you cry for so many reasons. First of all the horror that was endured is touched upon but then you're fed this story about these men who survive with each other and with the thoughts of their families that keep them alive. It is the most disturbing and yet uplifting film you could possibly see. I don't review this film based on the fact that I believe it should automatically be a ten out of ten but rather how I felt about it afterwords. It is truly the essential tribute. 10/10!!

Black Snake Moan," Tries to make people believe it has a moral...but its pretty shallow despite some good performances
","Black Snake Moan is about two things...one...the irrepressible Samuel L. Jackson...and two...Christina Ricci continuing her quest to completely shed her wholesome Disney 'lil gal persona which if other movies didn't...this one blows it away. I mean its gratuitous in everything that it does but somehow its trying to make us believe (successfully to some people) that it has a moral and something beneath that its trying to say but I don't believe that. I think its a messed up story about a girl who is messed up and finds a twisted relationship with a lonely messed up man...and she's naked most of the time. That's what Black Snake Moan is and that's why people see it period. It's not a complete loss because it's reasonably entertaining but twisted and dark and very country in the way that everyone is redneck through and through which is fine but its such a focus on the film. The story is too strong I think for what its trying to convey because at heart I think its trying to be a G-Rated Snuff film. You know showing all this without actually SHOWING all that. Still it has it all...Rape, beating, kidnapping, submission, misplaced religion, infidelity, hell even child rape if you count Ricci's seduction of a young boy. Sound good so far?Samuel L. Jackson is Lazarus, an aging, scorned farmer with the fear of God in him is basically loses his mind although that's never really addressed. His performance is excellent as you should expect from Jackson. Its not his best but given the material I think he gives it his all and really shines on screen. Christina Ricci is brilliant as the slutty, equally scorned, lonely, used and abused, Rae. Her performance actually makes this film worthwhile EVEN THOUGH I think she was completely gratuitously displayed and used by the film makers she really nails the part and makes it her own. Justin Timberlake makes a brief but very, very good cameo as Rae's returning boyfriend who essentially saves her from Lazarus...sort of. But the focus on the film as you can expect is between Jackson and Ricci who are really great together and really hold this movie together. If it weren't for them I think this would have been a steaming pile of garbage so thankfully you get to see two really good performances.Craig Brewer who wrote and directed Black Snake Moan, I think, is trying to make some sort of cultural statement in a very shocking way. Well the film can be shocking, revolting even but I never do see the statement at all. Nothing is really saved or changed...no one sees the error of their ways...the beginning and climax is there but then you don't get any just ending to all this. Essentially these two disturbed and scorned people find each other in the strangest way and end up taking to each other (not romantically or sexually) but on a different level but where does it get them really? The heart of the story is there but it gets caught up in all the other garbage that the film has to offer. All in all its definitely not crap...but mostly for the reason of the cast as I mentioned but the story won't blow your mind and for the most part its pretty easy to skip this one. 6/10",6,2,6,26 January 2008
The Hangover Part II," As good if not a hair better than the original...color me surprised!
","After The Hangover which was a wicked good time I knew they would make a sequel, I mean it was a HUGE success. But I figured there was no way they could do all that again. Well I was wrong...I eat my words...they do it all again and it is fantastic fun!! The guilty pleasure returns and is just as outrageous. The key to The Hangover II is that they use the same premise almost step by step and they stick to the 'if it ain't broke'...idea. Whereas some will complain that its just the same thing all over again...it isn't! Yes it is the same premise but the new locale, return characters, and a whole new wild experience makes this hilarious!! As I stated it is easily as good, if not just a little bit better, than the original. The original was so successful because the cast had so much incredible chemistry and this works once again because of that. The three guys, plus some of the original supporting gang, come back swinging and is absolutely hilarious. The two of them together might be two of the greatest adult comedies out there.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis fit back into their roles like it was their real persona. Phil, Stu and Alan are fantastic and their chemistry together might be some of the best on screen. Cooper still fits into the cool smooth popular group leader role flawlessly. Helms' Stu is more neurotic and whiny than ever in all the best ways and the absurd and eccentric Galifianakis' Alan is as hilarious as ever. I think in the sequel Stu got some of the greatest lines and greatest moments but its a toss up. Justin Bartha once against takes a back seat in the story and is hardly around so he's barely a supporting character. I thought for sure that after Ken Jeong's portrayal of Mr. Chow in the first Hangover became a cult favorite and his popularity soared on the sitcom Community that they would severely over-use him in the sequel. Once again I was wrong and impressed that they used him just the right amount. His comedic style is loud and obnoxious and over the top and must be used sparingly and they do exactly that making his appearances downright funny!! Paul Giamatti joins the cast and is a terrific new villain to the story. He's actually more of a serious gangster but his tone and awkward look fits the film perfectly. Keep your eyes open for the perfect cameo by Hangover favorite Mike Tyson in the end of the film! I said in my review of the first film I could never give the Hangover more than an 8/10 and I will say the same for the sequel. It isn't amazing film-making but it is downright hilarious, very adult, often dirty comedy. It's physical comedy, one liners, sarcasm and National Lampoon's style comedy (early National Lampoon's, like 80's when it was good and funny and gross.) Todd Phillips has spent his directorial career doing gross out/road trip type comedies (no pun intended--he directed Road Trip.) But The Hangover likely will cement his career as an epic comedy director. He manages to make over the top comedies without going over the top...he stops just on the line before its too much and then scales back and that is really a talent. Adam Sandler, and every SNL alumni out there who makes films could learn something from him. The Hangover II is more than a worthy sequel, the two films together are just absolutely hilarious and I hope and pray that they can come back and do it again but it is inevitable that eventually they will stumble and go too far or not find enough new material but until then adults everywhere who loved comedy should watch this sequel!! 8/10",Null,0,0,23 October 2011
Prisoners," Brilliant, fascinating, twisted and just one of the smartest films I've seen in ages
","I'm always actively pursuing the next dark thriller that will hold a candle to the film Se7en. I think that was easily the most brilliant crime thriller I have ever seen. I suspected that Prisoners could potentially be a terrific film and I was so pleased to discover that it is exactly that. I don't mean to say it was good as Se7en but it absolutely holds its own. There were some truly outstanding performances (and a couple of underwhelming ones), but the best part of this film was the script. What a brilliantly crafted, artistic, stunning film filled with symbolism, twists, turns and darkness. The film clocks in at a lengthy 2 1/2 hours but I didn't think it dragged at all. The pacing was consistent and I can't imagine any aspect of the film not being there in order to tell the full story. The clues added up, the twists made sense and I was able to put together the story and figure it out even before it was revealed (which is unusual for me.) But I mean that to be a good thing. As a movie goer you are privy to every detail and clue. This is absolutely not a typical mainstream film. Critics are raving about it and for good reason! I expected Hugh Jackman would give a good performance and he does. He is a powerful presence on screen and his unravelling as he desperately tries to find his daughter and will literally go to any length is disturbing and terrific. Jackman deserves acclaim once again for another performance. I thought Jackman would be the best performance in the film BUT that honour in my opinion goes to Jake Gyllenhaal. He is just electrifying on screen and what an amazing character he brings to life. Just watching him do this is fascinating because his character has so many ticks, habits, tattoo's...he clearly has a huge back story that we don't know about. I think its unusual but also brilliant for a film maker to give so much depth to a supporting character. Paul Dano gives a solid and very creepy performance as the accused Alex Jones. Dano is good but he might oversell it just a little bit in some scenes. Same goes for Melissa Leo (whom I admit I am sort of tired of and always found her overrated.) She is good in her role as Dano's Aunt but in some scenes I felt like she was overacting especially towards the end. I love Viola Davis, I think she is a great actor and she is decent in this but sort of underused and despite one particularly good scene between her and Dano, she sort of flounders in the shadow of Jackman and Gyllenhaal. The final two performances were the worst in the film unfortunately. Terrence Howard might have been alright if his character has been given more to work with. But when you have one father who is showing some powerful emotions and going to all ends to find his daughter...Howard's character comes across as skittish and boring. He looks terrified enough but that's the only emotion he demonstrates. I can't even say Maria Bello would be good under any circumstances because her character and her performance was just awful. Most of the film she spends in bed thank goodness but even in her gut wrenching grief it is overdone and overacted. Its really unfortunate because it somehow drags Jackman's scenes down just a little when she's in them. She is the weak link of this cast by far.Oscar nominated director Denis Villeneuve crafts the best thriller I think I've seen all year. I long to see the special features on a Blu-Ray release to see if he discusses all the things that were purposely done in this movie. It is clearly set in modern day and yet the homes, the appliances, the vehicles, the decor...all have a distinctive 70's/80's vibe to it. Despite some mediocre to bad performances by the main cast the film is not dragged down completely by it. Jackman and Gyllenhall are very nearly awe-inspiring in their parts so it balances out nicely. The film is so grey and bleak and the scenes are perfectly shot to leave you wondering what is coming next and what is happening. I am not a prude by any means and I can watch just about anything and have but I felt like the extreme language (particularly the 'F' word) was used FAR too much. I do believe completely that it was necessary in many spots and added to the characters but it was overused again and again until it became distracting and I hate that. Honestly, Prisoners is a 10/10 movie that loses points for silly little things that should have been avoided. The story is a 10, two performances are 10's, the cinematography is a 10...but then when you start looking at things that took away from how great these things were you have to penalize it a little. Regardless, True Crime fans or anyone looking for a really above average thriller cannot go wrong with this one. I think there was so much symbolism in this movie that I missed the first time around and the bizarre but appropriate religious undertones as well. See it for yourself but make sure you understand this isn't a blow-em-up action flick but rather a brilliant, masterpiece of crime film. 8.5/10",8,2,5,29 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Marvel continues its legacy
","Every time I see a Marvel film I feel like I'm writing the same review. I don't mean that in a bad way. Marvel has created this incredibly epic world that they just keep building and building and building and while I stand by the fact that eventually they are going to collapse and over-saturate the market, so far they are doing it right. The super-hero films they have created range from good to truly great and the first Avengers film was truly great. It was a non-stop thrill ride and the definition of a great summer Blockbuster. Since then we have the second phase of films (Thor 2, Captain America 2 etc) that served to build even more complexity to this intense world they have created. Sometimes I have to wonder if they are getting too smart for their own good. Avengers: Age of Ultron doesn't even cap any of the story. It actually is yet another middle ground in this Universe but it certainly serves to bring together Earth's mightiest heroes and further their story. The first Avengers film was amazing because it was the first step we saw all these amazing heroes on one screen together and director Joss Whedon did an incredible job of balancing everyone. Age of Ultron still balances everyone pretty well but gives far more attention and depth to characters that have been secondary up until now. The film started out just a little shaky for me but by the end I was as thrilled as I always am with a Marvel flick.One of the best things Marvel did was casting. The cast is amazing, always has been and everyone is so perfectly suited for their roles. We know these heroes so well from their own films so Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans fit back into their roles perfectly. I sort of liked that this Avengers film didn't beat us over the head with these characters in particular because we do get so much of them already. They are there and they are everything we love about them but its not too much. Mark Ruffalo actually turned out to be a terrific Hulk. Sure he never had his own film but in only a few scenes he always manages to steal the show and as an actor he manages to really convey the emotional torture of Bruce Banner in only a few scenes each film. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner return as Black Widow and Hawkeye and are the best they have ever been. The film gives them some serious back story and detail to their characters for the first time. I've never been a huge fan of Renner or Hawkeye but he stands out this time around. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen join the cast as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and both are good. Olsen is actually excellent and Taylor-Johnson is very underused and underdeveloped but still good. James Spader is the voice of the villainous Ultron and he is superb. His voice and personality is just absolutely dead on for Ulton. The rest of the cast is as good as they've ever been and you'll see all the familiar faces like Samuel L Jackson, Paul Bettany (who we get to see in person for the first time), Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie.Joss Whedon will forever be known as the man who managed to bring the Avengers to life. He says this is it for him in this Universe but his legacy will live on. In the first part of the film, which drops you squarely into the action, I was a little hesitant about where it was going. The CGI seemed a bit rough some of the trademark Avengers humour felt forced. But, thank goodness, the film finds its footing and the special effects are very good and the CGI is not overwhelmingly in your face. I felt like it did lack a truly epic moment like the first film had but it still gives you everything you could want. There are two or three battles that are outstanding and one truly epic moment that is Iron Man VS Hulk and I would literally see the movie again for that battle alone. In short, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not as good as the original but it does amazing things for the storyline and Marvel Universe and is outright entertaining. 8.5/10",8,1,4,19 May 2015
Quiz Show," How intriguing could a story about a botched Game Show really be? Very...in the right hands.
","Robert Redford is a great actor and he has had a lot of success with direction too and it wasn't until I actually started watching Quiz Show which I had wanted to see for a long time that I realized Redford wasn't in the movie but rather directed it so that kind of disappointed me. Although I wanted to see the movie because I liked Redford I truly had no idea what it was about, and I also didn't realize how based in truth it actually was until the movie prompted me to look into the fact behind it which was a lot and very interesting. It's even interesting and pertinent now seeing as how Game Shows have once again become so popular and makes you think a lot about that sort of thing. This is the key to Quiz Show, there are some really terrific, powerful performances and the direction and writing is simple and yet brilliant. The film is intellectually well done and still very entertaining to watch mostly because of the terrific cast and characters. It doesn't necessarily point fingers or tell you who was wrong and who was right but really takes this scandal and draws it out for you piece by piece and shows you everyones side and how it effects them. Anyone who enjoys a good strong movie could sit down and watch Quiz Show and be entertained by it, or thought provoked by it, and can get a variety of reactions out of it which is one of the things that makes it so intelligent. It's not action packed but character driven and the cast is so well picked that they make the characters come to life and seem completely intriguing to carry this story.John Turturro, who is a first rate terrific actor plays Herbert Stempel, an every day blue collar guy who finds great success on the famous game show 21. Unfortunately his revenge antics gets the better of him when he is set up to take a dive and replaced by an intellectual ratings grabber. Turturro is brilliant in the role, case closed. You hate him and yet feel sorry for him all at once. Ralph Fiennes is absolutely amazing as new intellectual champ Charles Van Doren who literally as Eye of The Tiger says trades his passion for glory. His character is very conflicted, and a true anti hero in every sense of the word. He is amazing in this role and I've never seen him in anything much that impressed me like this. Rob Morrow is just amazing as the investigator in the Oversights committee Dick Goodwin who becomes attached to Fienne's character as a friend and tries to protect him while still doing his job to the very end. These three actors make this film everything that it is. While there are some impressive and strong supporting characters including the terrific and multi talented Hank Azaria and the subtle but well played performance by David Paymer, Morrow, Fiennes, and Turturro steal the show...no pun intended. Clearly they found a niche in each other because they have great chemistry together and tell a story that leaves you enthralled in such a simple scandal.So far I have only seen two of Redford's direction projects...the other being last years panned Lions for Lambs which on the contrary I thought was downright brilliant (see my review.) Redford seems to want to tell a story regardless of what anyone else thinks because he is passionate about the content. Sounds silly in reference to a story about a rigged game show but somehow the passion for the content comes through loud and clear and while I wasn't quite blown away by the whole film, the performances, and the delicate re-creation of the time period and the entire world behind the scenes of the game show was brilliant. As I said earlier anyone can watch this and take something away from it even if it's as simple as saying...well that a good movie. But there is some very intellectual properties underlying and the three main cast members make the film really terrific. A great watch and I encourage anyone to check it out!! 8/10",8,0,0,21 August 2008
The Dark Knight," Quite possibly moving into the most successful film of all time and here is why...
","I will tell you right now that I completely ruined this film for myself. That's not to say that I didn't love it but this film might be one of the most hyped up, advertised, and talked about film of all time and 99% of it all was nothing but sheer greatness so you go into the film with high expectations which the film doesn't have any problem meeting. My problem was, despite the fact that I LOVE Batman (next only to Superman), grew up adoring everything about him, loved the movies until the disgustingly deplorable Batman and Robin, but I was determined to be critical of this film. I knew it would be great but I wanted to find the flaws in the bat armor and truth be told I'm not sure I could find any but constantly looking for it ruined the true greatness of this movie for me. Honestly I could write about this movie for pages and pages which is the sign of a great film. On top of that I almost wish I could with hold this review until I've seen the movie again and I will see it again!! Although a sequel of sorts with familiar cast members and Chris Nolan taking up the helm as director it absolutely stands on it's own merits and resembles more of a starting film that is pure brilliance but certainly Nolan gives loyal fans familiar tie ins from his original movie Batman Begins. The one thing I can be critical of in this film, is that while Heath Ledger is terrific as the Joker as everyone says he is, there are some equal if not surpassing performances by other members of the cast who are getting shafted.It seems this time around star Christian Bale is getting a bit of flack for his flawless portrayal of the man with dual identities. I think Bale is absolutely brilliant, completely built for this role and makes it near impossible for anyone to ever portray The Dark Knight OR Bruce Wayne ever again. He plays both sides so remarkably that you truly can't tell he is both characters. His overtly raspy voice as Batman is perfect, dead on, and adds an heir of darkness and mystery to The Dark Knight that was all about gone in the second installment of Tim Burton's Batman. The late Heath Ledger plays the best Joker ever to come from the pages of the comic book. I adore Jack Nicholson but his Joker wasn't the Joker that we all knew from the comic book. Joker was meant to be deranged, disturbed, twisted, brilliant, cold, and evil. Ledger embodies all of that and makes you squirm when he's on screen. He literally brings the joker to life and kudos to him for his final performance. He does deserve the acclaim he is getting. That being said Aaron Eckhart is just as, if not better, in his role as legal crusader Harvey Dent and later the twisted Two Face character. Eckhart should be nominated right along with Ledger AND Bale because he is amazing. He holds your attention and his performance as Two Face is far too short lived!! Gary Oldman is also incredible in his role as Commissioner Gordon, very under rated I think. Maggie Gyllenhaal is okay as Rachel Dawes but certainly no better or worse than Katie Holmes was. The amazing Morgan Freeman seems to give a half hearted and much less involved performance as Lucius Fox. I think this most definitely will be his last go around in the Nolan's Batman series. Although he doesn't have a big role I'm still trying to figure out how Eric Roberts ended up in the potentially biggest film of all time??!! The Dark Knight is the most unique super hero film ever made. It truly defines a Superhero epic. It's not so much an action film as it is an intense, dark drama about Batman. It really is the definitive Batman film and as much as I love sequels Nolan would be smart to end things right now because the odds of coming even close to this installment would be astronomical. Now the bad side...I hate the Batmobile or tumbler or whatever it's called. The new Batbike was okay but the scene with him driving up the wall was ridiculous and made me shake my head in disgust. I mean in such an epic well made movie how can you toss something in there so bad?! It felt like it was done on purpose. The Dark Knight is everything Batman should be and felt like it was very true to the comics and to the character. Certainly they didn't hold back how dark it was with some genuinely disturbing scenes and I was sure Two Face and whatever make up job they did would be disappointing and I couldn't have been more wrong. It was incredible and actually made me cringe when I saw it. Now let's talk Joker because obviously he is the focal point of much discussion and potential Oscar buzz. The Joker is phenomenal and everything you would expect from Batman's infamous nemesis. One of the greatest scenes in the film is Bale as Batman interrogating Ledger's Joker in the jail...just phenomenal. And when you think it's over...it's not even close to over. Ledger's Joker is disturbing and downright evil. The scene right from the bat (no pun intended) with Joker and his 'magic trick' sets the tone for what this Joker is all about. Any way you look at it this just put a bar on superhero films that few others will ever touch. Go see this now no matter what you like because it can't disappoint and you'll leave breathless!! 9.5/10",9,4,10,2 August 2008
Friends with Benefits," The ULTIMATE Date Movie, truly fantastic, cute and funny!!
","As many, many have pointed out Friends With Benefits is practically a carbon copy of the earlier release No String Attached. The difference? Friends With Benefits did everything right!! It really is the stereotypical romantic comedy but holds no punches and even takes time to poke fun at itself and the entire genre but unapologetically serves up exactly what it makes fun of. Irony! The laughs are non stop, and the adult humor is without pause throughout the whole thing. They could have easily toned down the adult tone but given the film is about sex it makes more sense to have a good ol' fashion R Rated comedies which are already ruling this summer anyways. It is simply fun to watch and yes it does end up pulling out the predictability you can expect from any romantic comedy but wouldn't you be disappointed if it didn't? As mentioned they manage to poke fun of itself and its own genre and ends with a cute heartwarming ending that wraps everything up.First of all let me just say that Justin Timberlake is going to be become a Hollywood A-Lister. His charisma on screen, his comedic talent, and his acting ability is outstanding! He makes the film worthwhile for anyone and handily carries the film. Mila Kunis gives one of her best performances since That 70's Show. Her character is stereotypical to a T. The hot young successful woman with a wild side that makes the male lead do things he would never have done before making him fall head over heels for her. But she is terrific and fun to watch and the chemistry between Kunis and Timberlake is near legendary. As far as I'm concerned it's Richard Gere/Julia Roberts worthy. They are great together. The supporting cast is nothing short of brilliant. Patricia Clarkson, Jenna Elfman, and the amazing Richard Jenkins are absolutely terrific in their respective roles. The only disappointing performance is that of Woody Harrelson whose 'gay' character is way overdone and becomes annoying rather than endearing when everyone else grows on you.Director Will Gluck is fairly new to directing but he has hit two big home runs in my book. First was the sleeper hit Easy A which seems to have made Emma Stone (who makes a small cameo in this film) an A-Lister pardon the pun and now this film. Simply he knows how to entertain and I think he has a big eye for talent. I doubt that Gluck will ever take home an Academy Award but he will entertain without a doubt. I know how some reviewers will take this film...predictable, mushy, overly dramatic in spots but I am judging this by sheer and utter entertainment value and I was thrilled with how entertaining it was. It is truly the perfect date movie because girls will love it and guys can enjoy it just as much for the comedy and the performances. An A+ movie experience!! 8.5/10",Null,0,2,8 August 2011
The Greatest Game Ever Played," Once again Disney proves it's magic...I am a Disney sucker
","I won't tell anyone that for them this is THEE movie to see...I won't tell them that hands down it should be made the best movie in existence. I will only give MY opinion which is what my reviews are all about and I fell head over heels in love with The Greatest Game Ever Played. Disney might make some mistakes here and there but they still have the magic and they always manage to get a hole in one every once in awhile. The Greatest Game Ever played is the true story of an American Underdog who captures the hearts of everyone when he beats out one of the world's greatest golfers to win the 18th US Golf open. You might expect that knowing the outcome of a film like this would completely eliminate any thrill or potential edge of your seat moments but brilliantly that is not the case!! Writer Mark Frost who also wrote the original novel keeps the story uplifting and moving and personal but still makes it about the game which is amazing for fans.Young and rising star Shia LaBeouf who truly shined in the kids' Disney Classic Holes takes on a slightly more grown up role as down on his luck dreamer Francis Ouimet who discovers he has a god given talent for playing Golf. LaBeouf is bright eyed and easy to watch and has a great knack for drawing you into his characters. He's a real kid hero that anybody could look up to and he's got a bright spirit that shines through. Now let's mention the absolutely terrific young star Josh Flitter who plays determined little caddie Eddie Lowery. Eddie is like the sidekick you might find in most animated Disney films. He's cute and encouraging and hilarious...gets all the funny lines. He lifts Ouimet up when he's down in the dumps and is the best caddie and friend in the world. Already landing several big roles Flitter will be someone to watch because he seems like a powerful presence for a little guy. Stephen Dillane plays world class and famous golfer Harry Vardon who really is the counterpart to Francis Ouimet. They have so much in common in the way they led their life and their determination to prove their worth to those who think less of them. Vardon is emotional and has a lot going on and Dillane shows a world of back story behind his eyes. He's a worth adversary on the course but an important 'hero' to the story. He does a fantastic job. Stephen Marcus is also great as Vardon's good friend and foe on the course Ted Ray. He's uncouth and brilliant at the Gentlemen's game rounding out the point that anyone can play Golf. He's also a good laugh and a great character. Mention must also be given to both actors Marnie McPhail, and Elias Koteas as Ouimet's parents...one very supportive of his dreams (his mother) and his father much more of a realist having been pounded by work ethic and those who think they are better than he is. Both have valid points and play caring concerned characters although small roles...both equally powerful.Subconsciously when you go to see a film every wants and expects certain things to happen. When you see a film of this kind you expect a certain format and you hope that these events take place and The Greatest Game Ever Played delivers every single thing I hoped would happen and when one of those things I thought didn't happen (his father being there at this winning shot) but it turned out he was (standing in the crowd holding money up to his son like everyone was doing...a tribute to amateur golfers who were not entitled to win the purse) I cried...yep I actually did...before I knew it my tears were welled up and I was smiling from ear to ear like I had just won the championship. From start to finish this beautifully made family film never disappoints and clocks in at 2 Hours but NEVER feels like it is. The golf games are still kept interesting and the film is well kept and a good pace and it's just such a feel good film. Not everyone might love it as much as I did and I can't necessarily explain my love of it except to say it was sweet and cute and funny and uplifting and there are just so few films that make you feel that way. Disney continues what it was meant to be and kudos to them and please don't ever stop making films like this. This is sure to be a classic!! Please check this one out with your family!! 10/10",10,2,4,27 April 2006
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Perhaps a tiny slip in the so far increasingly brilliant series...but so far it's been absolutely breath taking
","I would not for a minute tell you that Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix was not worth seeing or that as many critics have stated Harry Potter had 'lost it's magic,' fact is Order Of The Phoenix continues and achieves what few else if any film series has ever carried out and that's the continuity of absolute epic brilliance. So far from the very first film this series has only gotten better and better with maturity and story and part of that is the brilliance of the author of the original stories (which I have not read yet and likely won't until the films are behind me.) J.K. Rowling is so involved in these films and insists on absolute authority on each character and what makes it in the film and certainly if anyone knows how to bring her amazing and epic story to life it would be her. Order Of The Phoenix I 'think' is the bridge between everything from Hogwarts in the beginning unraveling to lead up to the epic ending of this series. Being the bridge can't be easy and probably doesn't fulfill some of the previous installments glory but it's still very important and still has some incredible scenes including an absolutely breath taking battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore that is easily on the top ten list next to Vadar and Skywalker, or anything from Lord Of The Rings. It's simply stunning!! The film does start out a little slower than most and yet seems to rush through everything but I understand The Order of The Phoenix is a massive book (in fact the longest in the series---870 pages) and that alone is enough to understand why there might have been a struggle to jam everything into this film that they possibly could and I have no doubt they did a stellar job but it still might have seemed slightly rushed and maybe a little incomplete. One of the most amazing aspects of the films to this point has been the incredible ensemble cast which sadly and unfortunately (but perhaps necessarily) leaves them in the back seat (especially the teachers and professors and adult characters.) However we do get far more from the students, from Harry himself and his best friends are still on the forefront. It was just sad to not have the more adult characters around more (especially Hagrid.) I won't go into too much detail about the already existing cast. After five films this cast will go into history as some of the greatest character actors in this epic series. Brendan Gleeson, Maggie Smith (always been one of my favorites since day one of this series), Alan Rickman, Warwick Davis, Emma Thompson, and of course Robbie Coltrane. They all make their appearances in different lengths but for the most part they are further in the background then ever before especially Coltrane and they are all so amazing. The core three (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint) have their characters down to a fine art and no one else could ever replace them case closed. Ralph Fiennes is deadly brilliant as the evil Voldemort. New additions to the cast in this round is the annoyingly over bearing Dolores Umbridge played very well by recent Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton. She is a clever additional villainess so to speak who impedes the children in their battle against Voldemort and attempts a mass and hostile take over of their beloved Hogwarts. Staunton is a valuable and hopefully returnable character to the series. Evanna Lynch is the slightly odd but seemingly powerful ally Luna Lovegood who does an absolutely amazing job playing the seemingly spinny but very friendly classmate to Harry. I hope she too returns because she also fits right into this cast. Gary Oldman also returns doing an amazing job in his role as Sirius Black.Order Of The Phoenix isn't quite as visually stunning as some of the previous films. They unfortunately don't find time to play a Quiditch game and there isn't quite as many beautiful creatures (the addition of Hagrid's giant half brother is very cool---would like to have seen more of him) and the mysterious centaurs in the shadowy forest were also quite stunning. Some of the views were brilliant but still overall this film seemed to focus far more on Harry and his struggles with Dolores Umbridge and his mind being controlled by Voldemort rather than going for the stunning visuals that were featured so prominently in it's predecessors. Still with everything being said although not the best in the series...to be this good and have this caliber of a film in the fifth installment is unprecedented and Order Of The Phoenix still has numerous scenes that have to be seen. It's brilliant and I wished I could have seen it on the IMAX especially with the added 3D content. This series is just amazing. 9/10",9,4,7,29 July 2007
Toy Story," My 900th review...perhaps the most amazing piece of animation in history....
","I think it is a pretty common conception that Toy Story revolutionized animation. Pixar's first release jump started the animation craze that has lasted nearly two decades and still going strong and gave birth to some of the biggest films of the last 15 years. So it should have been an easy choice for my 900th review with Toy Story craze back on with the new and equally as amazing third installment. Toy Story brings to life some of the greatest characters in film history. You will fall in love with all the characters within the first 15 minutes and makes every step of their fantastical adventure even more captivating. The adventure they go on when you look at it from a truth standpoint is no more than 'down the street' and back but when you're a 3-6 inch toy that changes everything and that is truly the brilliance of Toy Story. You will become one of these toys, their world is so real to you and you see everything from their perspective. Every single person on the planet had toys of one kind of another whether it be a stuffed teddy or a stick and watching Toy Story will make you fondly remember your childhood and look at every inanimate object we love in a different light.Tom Hanks is Woody. No one could ever take that away from him as is the case with many of the toys. Hanks is the soul of the good hearted, compassionate and brave toy cowboy. His voice is so incredibly animated and excited and just absolutely perfect. Tim Allen is as good as Hanks playing the role of everyone's favourite space toy Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry the film makers create between Buzz and Woody is phenomenal and probably one of the biggest reasons Toy Story remains so successful. If I could spend time on each and every voice actor in this film I would because this is without a doubt thee BEST voice acting cast in animation history. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (my personal favourite Rex), John Ratzenberger (simply amazing), and to a lesser extent but still amazing Annie Potts, John Morris (who was Andy in all three films spanning 15 years), Laurie Metcalf and the incredibly versatile character actor R. Lee Ermey. This entire cast created animation history. You will not find a better cast and considering they are all behind the scenes voicing fictional characters that is impressive.Director John Lasseter is not new to animation although Toy Story will certainly be considered his piece de resistance for certain. He has worked in various capacity on dozens of amazing Disney features but he obviously knows his characters, he obviously knows Disney and he obviously is in touch with the little child inside himself and all of us. Best of all Toy Story holds no punches. I would even hesitate to allow my young, young children to see the film before they were ready because there is truly some terrifying scenes in the film and some really creepy characters. Sid and his torturing of toys, and his rag tag band of creepy toy outcasts are downright creepy and make the story even more incredibly but could certainly creep out little children but the happy ending and the bright world of Andy's room and knowing that the Toys will win in the end brings everything together. If you hate cartoons, if you have never seen Toy Story you are short changing yourself because this film will make you realize animation is not your grand daddy's cartoons anymore. A brilliant amazing film that is probably one of the best ever made. 10/10 THANKS FOR STICKING WITH ME THROUGH 900 REVIEWS AND ON TO 1000!! 901 and 902 WILL BE TOY STORY 2 AND 3 RESPECTIVELY. Read on!!",10,0,0,4 July 2010
Blood Diamond," An adventure of great political importance creating iconic characters for film
","Blood Diamond created quite a stir when it was released showing a different side of the diamond industry. It also created a stir with critics and they loved it and now is taking away five Academy Award Nominations which really surprised me. It wasn't that the film wasn't good but it just didn't strike me as anything more spectacular than a run of the mill main stream action film. Sure there was a political underlying message and two really terrific stand out performances by the lead actors but it wasn't overtly artistic or moralistic and had plenty of action, explosions and heroes. Blood Diamond tries to be more than what it is and it might have succeeded considering the critics love it but ultimately it should be taken as nothing more than a run of the mill action film and a good one at that.Leonardo DiCaprio in his Golden Globe and Academy Award nominated role as Diamond thief Danny Archer. There is no doubt that DiCaprio creates another terrific film character in Archer. Archer is truly NOT a hero and yet you do root for him and hope for his redemption in what he does. He is a complex and intriguing character and the question of his redemption is open to interpretation as his final decision only comes from circumstance. Terrific actor Djimon Hounsou also in an Academy Award nominated performance as determined father and husband Solomon Vandy. Vandy is taken into slave labor to mine for diamonds and ends up finding a huge diamond that sends him into a turbulent adventure with Archer who agrees to help Vandy find his family. Vandy is far more the hero of the story and his dedication and love for his family makes him an intriguing opposite to DiCaprio's Archer character. The two of them are an odd teaming and yet they work so well together. Hounsou is perfect in the role. Jennifer Connelly plays reporter Maddy Bowen who becomes involved with Archer in trying to get a story. I have always thought Connelly was a bit of an over rated actor and this is really no exception. Connelly just doesn't seem up to par with DiCaprio or Hounsou and she doesn't fit in with the cast. The romance between her and DiCaprio is forced and unnecessary to the story.The brilliant cinematography, and setting, all filmed on location throughout South Africa is worth the price of admission alone and then performance by the lead males and much of the supporting cast make Blood Diamond well worth seeing. The story is interesting but I think it's far from politically controversial. Plenty of action, and scenery to keep this a riveting well worth it film but a surprise if it takes home any awards. 8/10",8,1,2,5 February 2007
Elysium," Very nearly superb...Neill Blomkamp nails it again
","Elysium had a lot to live up to in my books and in a lot of other people's books. District 9 came out of nowhere and very nearly floored everyone in the sci-fi genre. It was brilliant. So there was a lot riding on Blomkamp's second outing. Elysium was amazing. It was solidly entertaining, moving, gritty and well put together. It was very nearly as superb as District 9. Unfortunately there were a few performances that lacked a certain depth (and its surprising who was the worst perpetrator), and there were some pretty significant plot holes that I would have thought Blomkamp would be too thorough to let go. Still the film has an extensive plot that covers a lot of ground with that amazing political undertone that Blomkamp does so well. Elysium is a sweeping sci-fi epic with absolutely stunning special effects and breathtaking scenery and setting from the visceral horrible conditions of Earth to the beautiful setting of Elysium. You spend far more time in the shoes of someone on earth fighting to survive having grown up dreaming of a better place. I couldn't help but think how nearly perfect this was...District 9 was a solid huge ten for me and this was so close to a nine but I just couldn't quite give it that.Matt Damon was superb. He is always a great hero but his flawed and tortured character was just riveting to watch. He just shined when he was on screen and did a first rate job. He fit the style of the film so well and lead the cast flawlessly. Jodie Foster (whom normally I don't mind...she's far from my favourite but she is usually pretty good) is the perpetrator I mentioned above. Her wooden performance is unforgivable in this movie. She sports an awful fake accent...not even sure whether its English or just upper class but its awful and makes her sound fake and campy and unlike Damon, she does not fit the tone of this movie at all. She could have been an amazing villain with class and style and a subtle evil but she blew it hands down actually probably took this from a nine to an eight single handedly. Fortunately we had a secondary villain played by Sharlto Copley. Copley's villain is violent, over the top, psychotic and fun. He is definitely the physical force against Damon and his character was great. Alice Braga was decent as Frey, Damon's life long friend and love interest. She showed appropriate emotion and intensity and yet didn't quite blow me away but she was good. Diego Luna was excellent in a smaller role as Damon's best friend. I wish we had seen more from him because he really did a great job and had a good role. Same for Wagner Moura who was really terrific as Spider. At first I was worried he was cheesy and campy and like Foster but all doubts went out the window because he turned out to be a really solid role and well acted on his part. And I have to mention William Fichtner because (although he often plays very similar roles) I thought he was fantastic in a small cameo role as the factory head with little emotion or sympathy for the people on earth.I have no doubt that Neill Blomkamp got a much bigger budget for this film. Perhaps that was overwhelming to him so some details slip through the cracks in this one. Don't get me wrong...this was still an excellent, powerful movie and Blomkamp now has TWO fantastic sci-fi pictures under his belt. The film is full of emotional scenes and powerful action sequences. There is no down time and the pacing of the film is non-stop. I can't tell you how much I respect Blomkamp for working such powerful political messages into mainstream Sci-Fi epics. This one reeks of a message about immigration reform and struggling to find happiness in another place that seems to have it all. I'm not sure the message about everyone being made citizens changes the world for the better makes sense but its still a really terrific film. You may have to ignore some plot hiccups and Jodie Foster's performance but you will find yourself blown away by this sci-fi flick. I can't wait to see what Blomkamp has in store for us next. 8.5/10",8,0,3,22 August 2013
Taken," Taken is the kind of action flick that makes going to the movies worthwhile
","I really didn't know what to expect going to see Taken. Was it a drama or suspense thriller? Was it a pseudo action flick along the same vein as Mel Gibson's Ransom? I was pleasantly surprised that there was nothing pseudo about this film. Taken is a stone cold action flick with a captivating story that actually has some meat behind it but a straight forward kick-butt action hero kicking butt and taking names to get back his daughter. Comparisons to the Bourne films are not unfounded. The film goes from the U.S. through the seedy underbelly of Europe. The film has a serious enough message about human trafficking but still has this mainstream story about a father searching for his daughter and as he says in one of my favorite lines he 'has a certain set of skills that makes' him 'a nightmare for people like you.' The story manages to develop the main character and what he can do without actually ever showing him in his prime. Instead they introduce him through a bodyguard job and other small hints that he is a killer, and very good at what he does. Unlike other action films or heroes they don't try to introduce us by giving us a big back story. The film focuses on the task at end and is non stop action.I've never been a huge fan of Liam Neeson, he's okay but never really impressed me. That all changed watching him lead this film. Liam Neeson is incredible as the father who will stop at nothing to save his daughter. He's brooding and powerful and is just flawless at the combat and the action scenes. He does a great job. Maggie Grace plays Neeson's daughter who is taken by traffickers. She certainly appears younger than what she is but she doesn't a decent enough job. Her and Neeson have good chemistry as father and daughter. Famke Janssen takes a huge back seat role as Grace's mother and Neeson's estranged wife. She barely has any lines and hardly shares screen time. While the rest of the cast are just barely supporting none of them really stand out. I mean they all do a fine job but Neeson really shines and heads this film up so well that no one stands out above him and no one stands against him.Although a brilliant cinematographer and having worked on many great action films french director Pierre Morel hasn't had a lot of directing experience but it is clear that he has had some great mentors likely including Luc Besson who is a brilliant director writer and film maker. Regardless Morel has a flare and style all his own and really handled the film well. Taken is a rare gem in action films because I don't think anyone sees it coming. It's an action thrill ride with heart and will entertain even the staunchest of critics. 8.5/10",8,1,2,5 March 2009
Alice in Wonderland," A clever re-telling of the classic story in true Burton style
","First I should mention I did see Alice in Wonderland in 3D. I mention this because 3D is out of control and I am the President of the opinion that it truly is being overused and killed before it even begins. Does Step Up 3 need to be in 3D? Or Robin Hood, or Clash of The Titans or the dozens of other movies that are? Having seen Avatar in both forms I can tell you the 3D made little difference...Avatar was great because it was great. That being said Alice in Wonderland in 3D was truly a Wonderland. This was some of the best 3D I have ever seen including Avatar. The world is perfect to be seen in 3D and the characters are brilliant loud and boisterous. A true brilliant twist was for Burton and the film makers to make this a sequel that isn't a sequel at all. It combines everything from Alice In Wonderland, Through The Looking Glass, a new spin to the story but still this is a simple re-telling for the most part of the original Disney classic leaving out much of the extra in the novel behind. The only downside to this is that the film flies through the content too quickly and leaves you a little breathless by the end of it.Mia Wasikowska, who is described as a newcomer, is truly terrific as the nearly twenty Alice who is being forced into adulthood and marriage. She really makes Alice come to life and I think she has a really terrific career ahead of her! She headlines this cast flawlessly. Helena Bonham Carter is absolutely amazing as the Red Queen. This is the second best 'animated' performance I have seen in less than a year (first being Zoe Zaldana's performance in Avatar.) Bonham Carter is wild and over the top of larger than life and she is a true classic Disney villain. If there is only one reason to see this movie she would be it. Fortunately she isn't the only reason. I certainly had no desire to see this for Johnny Depp. Depp is becoming a typical offbeat character actor after Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka and now The Mad Hatter. I figured it would be Willy Wonka all over again but I was completely wrong. Depp shows some incredible talent yet again putting actual heart and character but still maintaining what we all know and love about the Mad Hatter. Anne Hathaway, who is a great actress, doesn't really do much in her rather silly and contrived performance as The White Queen. She should have stuck with being offered the role of Alice because this does nothing for her career especially next to Bonham Carter. The full cast of supporting characters are really terrific including Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas (hilariously done), Stephen Fry (the best Cheshire cat in years), and Alan Rickman to name the best of the best in the cast.Tim Burton is no stranger to bizarre and that really makes Alice In Wonderland perfect for him. When all is said and done he doesn't go too high off the deep end although Alice In Wonderland is already pretty deep but he does make it a bit of a dark and twisted story that makes it entertaining for adults and kids alike although young kids might find it a little too dark. Regardless if you want to see a truly great classic re-told with spin and looking stunning in 3D then Alice In Wonderland will really impress you. For those that seem to think it wasn't good or didn't meet expectations I think the idea of a fantasy epic is cut short because it flies through the story so quickly. All in all this one is a must see for the family and sure to become a classic in Disney standards. 8.5/10",8,3,5,4 April 2010
Avatar," I eat all my words Mr. Cameron...Avatar is thee greatest sci-fi epic of all time
","So what do I mean when I say I eat my words? Well it annoyed me that the fact that James Cameron was the sole reason to see Avatar. Yes he's a renowned director but I don't even consider him in the same league as a Spielberg or a Scorcese (not that I am a huge fan of Scorcese personally.) I didn't quite understand the 'visionary' everyone thought he was. Yes he's done some solid action/sci-fi flicks and yes he managed to direct Titanic to record breaking greatness but was this enough to base Avatar solely on? Well I miss the Titanic of boats because James Cameron's decade long labor of love might be at the very least one of the great film epics ever made. Hands down if nothing else Avatar is the most visually stunning piece of film you will ever see (and I didn't see it in 3D YET.) As many have said the CGI in the film which is practically 99% of the entire film is nearly flawless and the work put into the Na'vi people especially the main characters is just amazing. Add in the fact that there are some genuinely incredible performances and an entire world built from the ground up and sci-fi lovers will be floored this creation. It still won't be the type of film to reach out to all genres but it is quite possibly one of the best movies I have ever seen.Sam Worthington is quickly becoming someone to watch for in Hollywood. He leads the cast in Avatar with skill and a brooding personality. Unfortunately for him Worthington is not the strongest in this cast. He does well and yet his character doesn't have nearly the depth of some of the others. Still this should do amazing things for his future. Zoe Saldana on the other hand is mind blowingly brilliant. She gives the performance of her career and does it all behind the shadow of a CGI character proving that talent and brilliance can shine through even in voice and computer capture. Her character shows so much incredible emotion and is so brilliant, she should be given an Oscar just for those merits alone. She is stunning. Sigourney Weaver slips back into sci-fi brilliance as Dr. Grace Augustine. She goes through a range of personality changes but is definitely a character you can feel empathy for. Yes she also smokes in the movie...please get over it. It's a character flaw, millions smoke. And just as a side note this woman who is a lovely FIFTY NINE YEARS OLD...looks incredible. Stephen Lang gives us a performance that just may be one of the great film villains of all time. First of all he simply looks bad ass. Second of all he gives a strong, surly, performance that admittedly is a little two dimensional (get the irony) he serves his purpose as evil villain and pulls it off amazingly. Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi (amazing cameo role), Joel Moore (great character actor) and the entire cast that play the supporting Na'Vi characters are all brilliant in their own way. Some stand out more than others but the entire cast comes together perfectly.I just always though director and writer James Cameron had a run of good luck with Titanic and his earlier works in Aliens and True Lies and creating the Terminator world. But when you look at his body of work he's never done a bad movie. The man knows science fiction and Avatar has really been his thesis, his ultimate show and he accomplished it in a big way. Maybe I'm over hyping the film but it's just been a really long time since I was riveted to my seat, transported like this film did for me in the theater, make me want to see it again the moment the credits wrapped. If you are one of the people who has not contributed to the 1.4 billion dollar take I suggest you get out there and add to it because this film deserves to be #1 film of all time. I can't go right out there and say my favorite of all time yet but top five at the very least. Let's face it Titanic was your Grandma's movie...this one is for us. You are King of The World Mr. Cameron...the world and Pandora. 10/10 and then someADDITION---February 5th/2010 I had the pleasure of seeing Avatar for a second time and saw it in 3D. Was it impressive? Yes. The technology is very impressive and looks cool. Did it change the entire face of the movie? Sorry folks...it didn't for me. The movie is incredible but its incredible because its Avatar, not because of the 3D. I'm glad I saw it and it was on an IMAX screen so it was explosively cool but the movie is great on its own and gains very very little in 3D except a lot of depth.",10,7,15,9 January 2010
Toy Story 2," The Toys ARE back in town and its good to see them!!
","I suppose I could argue all day why Toy Story 2 isn't on the same grand scope as the first film. I think its an incredible feat to even stay on the same playing field as what I consider to be one of the greatest films of all time. Toy Story 2 DOES stay on that playing field but it falls just a tad short of the original greatness and I can tell you why. The original cast all return which is amazing and the magic is still as strong as ever. The story focuses heavily on Woody with Buzz this time coming to his rescue and during Woody's adventure he finds a host of new toys, some that become a permanent part of the cast. The only issue I can take with this film compared to the first is the rest of the cast takes a back seat to Woody and his new companions. The cast is so amazing and the whole Toy box is so fantastic that you just lose something from the overall picture when they aren't at the forefront. The movie is still absolutely a must see and it is an integral part of the now trilogy. Much time is spent at Al's Toy Barn instead of adventuring from one place to another but the concept is still terrific.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to their brilliant roles as Woody and Buzz. No one could ever replace these two. They completely create their respective characters. Somehow the chemistry between their characters just isn't quite the same as it was in the first film. That's not to say it isn't good but they spend more time apart and I think you miss their comradeship. Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn (still amazing and hilarious as Rex), John Ratzenberger, John Morris, and Laurie Metcalf all return to their roles and I think it would change everything if they hadn't. Its a pleasure to see them back. Newcomers to the cast are downright brilliant. Estelle Harris is hilarious and brilliant as Mrs. Potato Head. Joan Cusack became an instant hit as Jessie the cowgirl. (I personally find her overdone and almost annoying but I know many love her.) Kelsey Grammar is the perfect voice for Stinky Pete the Prospector. My only regret there is that Pete isn't as good a villain as I would have hoped for (he's no lotsa---see Toy Story 3) but he's still good. Joe Ranft is adorable as Wheezy the Penguin, and voice actor expert Jodi Benson adds the perfect voice to the spunky Barbie. Wayne Knight is also a welcomed addition as the bumbling bad guy Al.So I think you can pick out from my review where I think the film makers stumbled just a little from the original amazing film but expectations would have to be absurdly high. Some of the highlights of this film include the discovery of the Buzz Lightyear aisle at Al's Toy Barn, which hearkens back to the original laughs of Buzz and his first appearance. Joining original director John Lasseter are two more Disney directors, one of whom will go on to direct the incredible Toy Story 3. Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich don't have a ton of directorial experience but I imagine if anyone could hone their skills Lasseter would be the perfect director to do it. Toy Story 2 does lack some of the heart of the original, and misses some of the comradeship from the first but Toy Story 2 is still a must see movie for kids and adults alike because the series as a whole is the most brilliant animation you could possibly see. 8/10",8,0,1,4 July 2010
Drag Me to Hell," A solid return to Horror for Raimi, twisted, gory with a great story!
","Director Sam Raimi comes back to horror and makes a terrifically creepy and gory horror fest that truly captures the essence of the 70's horror exploitation films. The story is really solid and the performances of the cast make it a really worthwhile horror. The creepy story combines the best of cheap thrills, over the top gore, and eerie supernaturalism to create a terrific scare but also to solidly entertain. I expected the film to perhaps be a little bit campy in the same way as Evil Dead, Raimi's original horror camp masterpiece but in actuality Drag Me To Hell was far more real and grounded and actually a serious piece of horror. The whole concept of the movie is to make you squirm and there is plenty of that from old lady/zombie mucus to a demon possessed sheep which is downright hilarious in a sick and twisted way. Really strong characters and great chemistry make the film even better and above your average horror film and that genre has been lack luster as of late. I felt like the twist at the end was a little bit predictable and at the same time contradicted the strength of the lead character but nonetheless it still holds together.Alison Lohman returns to the big screen after quite an absence. I always thought Lohman had a big career ahead of her although she hasn't had a break out role really. Still she has always looked very young but had some very mature roles. In this role she really shows off some chops for being a strong willed, really respectable female. She is a great lead!! Justin Long plays her devoted boyfriend. He kind of takes a back seat to her despite kind of being the bigger star but he does well in either spot and they have great chemistry together. They are very believable and he does great in a serious role. It took me back to his terrific break out role in Jeepers Creepers. Lorna Raver is downright disturbed and twisted as evil Gypsy Sylvia Ganush. Her and Lohman play off each other terrifically in their first scenes together. She makes a great horror bad gal. Dileep Rao plays a small but important and well played role as a small shop psychic who agrees to help Lohman's character. I think I would have really liked to have seen him have a bigger role more like a 'Dr. Loomis' (Halloween reference) type character. If the film is serialized he should definitely return.This is one of those instances where the cast just really works so well together and the story and all the other pieces that make a solid movie. Of course Drag Me To Hell isn't going to win any accolades with critics or likely win any awards at all and yet it is completely entertaining and worth seeing for anyone who is a fan of the genre or wants to be thrilled and scared all at once. It's the perfect camp fire story with a Stephen King twist to it. Everyone loves a good twisted Gypsy story. Definitely check this one out because you will love it for it's genre inducing fun! 8/10",8,1,2,12 July 2009
Selma," Another Bio-Pic that misunderstands its purpose
","I saw exactly one trailer for this before Birdman and right away I thought that this would be one critics would love or it would be another case of The Butler where audiences loved it but critics mostly ignored it. It seems to be falling somewhere in the middle. In some ways I was disappointed with the film but it resonated with me because it was so familiar to other bio-pics I've seen recently like J. Edgar or Invictus or Mandela (and no I'm not picking on Clint Eastwood or Nelson Mandela) Consider this, we have yet to have an epic bio-pic about the entire life of Martin Luther King Jr. We have never seen an incredible actor stand up and perform the 'I Have A Dream' Speech or watch in horror as his brutal assassination is recreated. We have never had any of that. So when you go into a film that focuses on one tiny aspect of a man who is larger than life, you walk away feeling more than a little cheated. What happened in Selma was very important...don't misunderstand me...but I wanted more. I wanted to see more Dr. King, I wanted to see more of the story and what he did and I felt like this spent too much time focusing on that one event and you don't get anything else around it. They do try to establish the tumultuous world and do so very effectively but there are very few of us who haven't seen this done before in films.The cast was good but fell short of being great in my opinion. David Oyelowo was very good as Dr. King. What an incredible role for him to take on and he certainly looks the part, sounds the part and delivers his one particular speech very very well. It actually gave me goosebumps to think about what Oyelowo could have done with the role had they given him more to work with. Same could be said for Carmen Ejogo who plays his wife. Their dynamic and side story actually was one of the most interesting in the film and they could have revolved an entire film around their marriage, that would have been more fascinating. Despite reviewers saying otherwise I thought Tom Wilkinson did an excellent job playing President Lyndon Johnson. He isn't given as much as he could have either but what he does is very good. There were some interesting conversations between him and various other political figures that I think were perhaps meant to imply various historical actions (a fascinating conversation between LBJ and J Edgar played by Dylan Baker held implications about the Kennedy Assassination I believe and perhaps Dr. King's assassination too.) Oprah Winfrey has a small role mostly in the beginning of the film but she proves again that she still has some acting chops. Everyone else in the cast is good in various small but integral supporting roles. No one really stands out from the main cast as important as their characters are.Before even looking at the director for the film, I thought to myself I guarantee they are someone with out a lot of experience. Ava DuVernay has done a little of this and a little of that but doesn't have a ton of experience yet behind her. I think it showed in this film. She probably had a lot of great ideas and tried to pack everything in there but I feel like she is missing what could have been provided about this story. Any film with Martin Luther King at the forefront should be moving and have a profound impact and Selma failed to do that for me. It was decently told and I understand everything and there were some good scenes but nothing we haven't seen before and it just gave us information and didn't move us or make us feel like we were there. I watched this back to back with another historical based on a true story film called Unbroken and both movies gave us plenty of information but failed to put us in the shoes of the people there and that's what a great bio-pic and period piece should do. Much like The Butler last year, I felt like this didn't give what it could have so its a miss in my books. 6.5/10",6,6,11,11 January 2015
Grindhouse," The Grind House is the closest thing to Time Travel that exists...I turn myself over to Tarantino/Rodriguez
","I have spoken a splurge of hatred towards director Quentin Tarantino before and honestly I don't know why. I think it was a personal thing...he seems egotistical, and goes out of his way to make what he thinks is his own personal 'art' and has to make everything unique and blah blah blah...but the funny thing is I have really yet to see a Tarantino film produced, directed or otherwise that I didn't like. I loved the Kill Bill Series, Reservoir Dogs, Sin City, etc etc. (I have yet to see Pulp Fiction believe it or not.) Well The Grindhouse, and his entry into that series (Death Proof) makes me drop to my knees and surrender to the Tarantino spell. Grindhouse is brilliant and I will review each film independent of each other because they must be. They are that different. Grindhouse truly, without hesitation or pranks or anything else provides TWO feature length, completely stand alone worthy films back to back completely with faux exploitation trailers in the middle as comic relief. If film is art then Grindhouse takes it to a new level because Tarantino and Rodriguez capture an era long gone of 70's sleaze, exploitation film and make you feel like you're sitting right there in the Grindhouse.PLANET TERROR---Now for entertainment purposes I did enjoy Planet Terror more than Death Proof. It's your stereo typical slasher zombie flick with blood and gore like you would not believe. But the plot and story is good!! Everything falls into place and Planet Terror makes the Land of The Dead look like a joke, it's that well made. Rodriguez actually made a campy, slapstick horror but made it the best possible way...like it was dead freakin serious. It's hard if not impossible to create that 'so bad it's good' feel to it and he pulls it off. With everything going on to make it campy and hilarious, everyone on and off screen take it dead serious making it the best horror film to date of the year. Freddy Rodríguez is brilliant as the shot gun toting hero that will stop at nothing to save his band of survivors. He is downright awesome!! Rose McGowan is equally strong (in the first thing I've ever seen her in where she performs well) as Cherry, the former go-go dancer who finds herself in the wrong place at the wrong time and quickly adapts to being a soldier with a killer leg. Josh Brolin, in a smaller role is easily iconic and brilliant as Dr. Block, the disturbed and angry Doc who wants to kill his wife. Marley Shelton is also good as his wife. And giving what I think is the performance of his career is B-Movie actor Jeff Fahey as JT, the rough and gruff BBQ cook that likes the action. Enter some amazing cameo performances by Michael Biehn, Naveen Andrews (of TV's Lost), Stacy Ferguson (Black Eyed Peas), and the one and only Bruce Willis (who is not credited) and you've got a killer horror flick...huge 10/10.DEATH PROOF--- is perhaps (in true Tarantino style) far more cult like and artistic than Planet Terror. Tarantino spends far more time establishing his seemingly stereo typical characters (both victims and main characters) but still creates this iconic serial maniac story about a stunt man who for some mysterious reason likes to stalk and murder young girls with his 'Death Proof' car but suddenly finds himself on the other side of things when two stunt girls fight back against him and basically annihilate him. Kurt Russell is in full form as the aging maniacal and likely iconic Stuntman Mike. The cast of girls are all very good...and although seemingly 70's exploitation stereo typical they all do a great job. Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Zoe Bell (making a unique and very good stand out performance playing herself), Tracie Thoms, Rosario Dawson, Jordan Ladd and I wish I had the space to go into details about some of these performances. The action is far lighter except for the beginning and the end and the middle is all about establishing the characters of these girls. Brilliant!! Zoe Bell is brilliant and funny, as is Tracie Thoms as the equally strong and outspoken black woman. I don't have near the space to go into detail about how brilliant Grindhouse is. From cameo appearances, to two performances by Tarantino himself, to Nicholas Cage, to the amazing exploitation trailers, to the gritty look of Planet Terror and the 'missing film reels' of Death Proof and the retro 'coming attractions' and 'feature presentation' graphics. Grindhouse is an experience you MUST see in theaters. I may even go see this film again which is something I rarely do. The film clocks in at a phenomenal 3 1/2 hours and you'd never know it because it is that good and truly a double feature by all standards. It is the most unique and brilliant film of this year and possibly the last few years. Brilliant!! 10/10",10,2,9,8 April 2007
Invictus," As thee number one Clint Eastwood fan this one was good but not epically good like some make it out to be
","Now don't get me wrong, Invictus was a great film. I enjoyed it, it entertained me, there were good performances, Freeman's Mandela is terrific and the historical aspect was decent BUT most reviewers and critics both professional and amateur alike are hailing this as some amazing piece of emotional art and it just didn't quite hit me like that. I adore Clint Eastwood, like LOVE him as a director and an actor. I've said before Eastwood is probably the only director I see because of him behind the scenes. I think this was more cut and dry than most Eastwood projects. It was simple (in a good way) without any twists or turns or really intense moments. He told a story in the simplest of terms and it works mostly because of the performances of the lead cast. Now it pains me to say this but neither the direction, the film, or the lead cast deserve Oscar nominations. I realize the film and director weren't nominated but there was a lot of expectation. Everything about was good...but only good. Even the inspirational aspect and the typical sports fever was toned down and not quite emotionally moving.Morgan Freeman is amazing. The man is a legend and is in his prime at 73 years old!! He gives a really solid performance as the incomparable Nelson Mandela. He is definitely the best performance in the film but it isn't really his best work, its just a good performance. Matt Damon plays quiet strong Rugby team Captain Francois Pienaar. Its a good performance but not as strong as Freeman and in my opinion not deserving of an Oscar nod whatsoever. Damon has had far better roles and in fact his 'subtle' performance in this movie could also be considered quite dry and kind of uneventful. However Damon and Freeman have great chemistry together. The supporting cast are all solid and do their respective roles well but no one stands out like either of the lead actors.I feel like maybe I am harping on this movie and I don't mean to be. It is absolutely well worth seeing and I think my score of the film reflects that. I suppose I expect a lot from Eastwood plus the hype following the film doesn't help but I guess I expected tears streaming down my face and cheering but it was just more of a smile and a nod when the movie was over. I would have more liked to have seen a full life story of Mandela. The best parts of the film had nothing to do with the Rugby aspect although obviously the whole film revolved around the sport and how important it was to bringing the country together but the best parts were about Mandela as a person and what he went through. A particularly powerful scene has Damon's character standing in Mandela's cell measuring out how small it was and imagining him in the cell. Please see this film especially if you're a fan of Damon, Freeman, or Eastwood but go in with decent expectations and not the overwhelming hype that is everywhere. 8/10",8,0,0,7 February 2010
Mission: Impossible," This is one mission you MUST choose!!!
","Mission Impossible will stand the test of time and will be a classic action film and series. I haven't seen an episode of the original TV series in many, many, many years so it in no way effected by opinions of the film blockbuster. Mission Impossible is everything an action film needs to be and easily embodies everything that great action classics have. A top drawing movie star in Tom Cruise, a really good villain, a big action film director, an enormous budget, and a complex and intriguing story line with plenty of action scenes.Tom Cruise headlines the cast as disavowed agent Ethan Hunt. Now say what you will (and people are saying plenty nowadays) about Cruise but I still think he's a powerful star and a great on screen presence and this was no exception. The character is not entirely difficult or complex but Hunt is suave, smart, well trained and a great hero and Tom Cruise pulls it off flawlessly and no one else could play Hunt. He's perfect in this role!! Jon Voight is his mentor and father figure as well as the perfect adversary as he takes a turn to the bad side as veteran IMF agent Jim Phelps (the only character to return from the original TV Series.) Voight adds class and experience to the cast and he's absolutely villainous as Phelps and although he's really no match for Hunt who he's trained perhaps too well his character is perfect as is he in the role. Emmanuelle Béart is as close to a leading lady as the film has. Mission Impossible kind of has a stigma almost like a 'Bond Girl' with each film and Béart is the Mission Impossible girl for this installment, Claire Phelps (wife/'widow' of Jim Phelps.) She does a decent job but the chemistry is slightly lacking between her and Cruise and she never really gets a big character development, she's just kind of there but she does alright. Becoming one of my favorite supporting character actors is french actor Jean Reno who plays bad guy Franz Krieger. I prefer him in hero roles but his bad guy is equally good although he's kind of the henchman of the film and is doomed from the beginning. He still adds to the cast a great deal. Ving Rhames plays disavowed agent Luther Stickell in a role which turns into a long lasting partnership between Luther and Ethan. His role is slightly small but they probably keep it small so as to not overshadow Cruise's character because Rhames can be a big screen presence in his own right. Also noteworthy is MULTI talented and MULTI Oscar nominated (one win) actress Vanessa Redgrave who plays 'Max.' She deliciously mysterious and bad all at once and the sexual chemistry and banter between her and Cruise is overwhelming and very witty. She definitely adds some class to the film.Now I will admit to something because I've heard many other people mention this as well, since seeing Mission Impossible over ten years ago and several times since the plot has confused me since day one!! It was only this most recent viewing that I finally understood it. I suppose it's not overly complex but they really don't go into a lot of detail and explain it out. But the film has always been incredible because of it's action sequences and characters which really gives the film a lot of kudos. It's absolutely worth seeing and worth seeing again until you do understand it. I think it could have been simplified but for what it is, it's great and it will be if not already an absolute classic. Ethan Hunt's daring theft of a top secret agent list as he dangles above an incredibly high security room, the edge of your seat chase aboard a high speed train, and OF COURSE...the unmistakable thumping beat of the Mission Impossible song which is used three times in the film and every time absolutely gets your blood pumping!! If you want an unmistakable incredible action film this is it!!! 9/10",9,2,4,19 April 2006
La La Land," Average in every way and maybe a little unique but not worthy of the acclaim
","To me, the Oscars nowadays means that the critics all got together and decided to play a popularity contest that quite often the mainstream movie going public doesn't see eye to eye with. I love musicals...like adore them...so I was excited for LaLa Land and so I was disappointed and confused by the fact that it did not come close to fulfilling expectations. I will say there were a couple of scenes that were very well done. The film has a unique vibe that is timeless and some of the dance and music scenes are reminiscent of an era gone by. It is definitely an artistic film. However, the story and the characters and the climax of the film is utterly and completely bland. It's not the type of film I could watch more than once and I don't understand how it is even classified as a musical when it had very few blatant musical numbers and it felt like it was more about jazz or 'LaLa Land' itself than the music. The hardest part to accept was the lack of chemistry with the stars and just the overall lack of a solid story to hold onto.Emma Stone is notable for this film because she is Emma Stone. She has an undeniable chemistry on screen and it always works at least a little bit. Still her struggling character actress is okay at best and she never really goes through any arc at all and you're left feeling very underwhelmed. Ryan Gosling honestly is downright terrible. I don't know if it's the writing or what but his character is vapid and empty and boring. Their 'romance' is silly and contrived and it never takes off despite them trying desperately to make you root for these two. Somehow the 'music' brings them together and their love of the arts. There is some supporting cast but honestly no one comes even close to being memorable or stepping up to anything. It's overall a very large disappointment.If the film was just a few dance scenes with Gosling and Stone I might be inclined to love it but unfortunately they make you sit through a sub-par story first. I guess the choreography and some of the scenes are worth noting. The thing is I adore writer and director Damien Chazelle. Whiplash was literally incredible. Easily one of the best films of the year. I had such high hopes this would be more of the same and I get the art behind it and the neon glow and the story of Los Angeles and struggling artists but there is no meat here. There is nothing that captivates you and a film that won all kinds of awards and (nearly) won Best Picture is barely memorable. Film schools might study it but for me once is enough. 5/10",5,4,8,2 May 2017
Saw," Almost the best movie I have ever seen...almost!! Spoiler Alert
","Nope, not kidding here ladies and gentlemen, the words brilliant, amazing, entertaining, intriguing and a worthy film come to mind. The words slightly flawed, under used, mainstreamed and poorly casted also come to mind. But for director James Wan's first time around, it is truly a remarkable piece of film. It almost made the status of being the greatest movie I have ever seen. Comparisons to the amazing Seven w/ Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are not unfounded. The world created by Wan in Saw is a gritty, dark underworld of murder, lust, and twisted imagery and interestingly as David Fincher did in Seven, they never once mention the city or state or any other location in the film. It's just people who exist on a dark playing field, caught in a game of terror.Saw is the story of an incredibly sadistic terminally ill killer who plays games with his victims that ultimately end up in them ending their own lives so that he never actually kills anyone himself. He is a voyeur into the lives of these people. In his first round of murders a detective played by Danny Glover and his partner played by Ken Leung track him down after finding his first victims. He narrowly escape and in the process cleverly murders Glover's partner. Glover then becomes obsessed in tracking him down and ending his murderous spree. Fast forward an unknown period of time, the killer kidnaps a young married surgeon and a washed up photographer and chains them inside a small bathroom type area. Together feet apart they must unravel the mystery of this killer's plan in order to escape with their lives and the doctor's family's life. First the unfortunate side, bad news before good. The plot line for this film has been mainstreamed in order to bring the teenies out. It's still much more than a slasher flick but they put in the necessary elements that almost ruin the film. The inappropriate humor in the film takes away from the tension, and ruins the perfectly terrifying atmosphere of the film. At times you wonder if you're supposed to laugh but can't quite help it anyways. Leigh Whannel's character of Adam is inappropriately funny and it's a shame really. Danny Glover's character of Detective David Tapp is perhaps the saddest part of this movie. In his acting caliber with this character they had an unbelievable, memorable presence left completely un-'tapped' no pun intended. A washed up, removed from duty, emotionally disturbed detective who has become maniacally obsessed with tracking down a serial killer that ended his partner's life. This is a whole movie premise on it's own. And yet Wan chooses to barely touch on it, and Glover's role in the movie is instead pointless and unused. What a complete shame!!The cast of the film was not brilliant. Whannel leaves much to be desired as an actor although this appears to be his first 'real' role so we can cut him some slack. Cary Elwes as the imprisoned Doctor, who has been around for a long time in supporting roles really has no excuse. This could easily have been his break out role and although he has several shining emotional moments, there are also times where the over reacting and the under reacting is too much to bear. In the hands of a much more skilled actor, this role could have brought tears to my eyes. Monica Potter does alright with what she is given in the 'Gwyneth Paltrow--Seven' type role. The daughter of the doctor and Potter's character is played by Makenzie Vega who has had several small Television roles. She does a great job as the terrified little girl.On from the bad news and what makes this film 'almost' the best movie. There is another person who posted a review on here 'The Unemployed critic' who absolutely despised this movie. I wonder after reading his review if he was asleep through this film? This is Wan's first time out as a director and there are few if any who are given the opportunity and ideas that this movie presents. You have the most complicated, terrifying story of two men in desperation, first not wanting to be together, then having to work together, then hating each other for being there, then caring for each other, then relying on each other, and finally they just have to be together in order to survive as shown by Whannel's plea to the doctor 'Don't Leave me' in the final scenes. Their desperation and terror is reflected in their constantly changing moods and emotions. The whole story for these men is carried out on a four foot chain, locked in a giant puzzle. On the outside you have what seemingly appears to be another man who is the killer, watching them, terrorizing Dr. Gordon's family but in actuality he is only a pawn in the game himself, being terrorized and forced to stay alive as well.The room is filled with clues, the dead body, the telephone, the photograph, the neon X, the heart, the saw...it all leads up to one terrifying climax that will leave one man with the decision to live or die. Wan does not resort to the cheap thrills jumps of other slasher type horror films and instead instills a feeling of dread and terror in the audience as he builds up the climax and we are revealed each step of the puzzle as the characters are. I do not believe Wan fully used the characters to the best of potential and although I do believe Serializing this film would most likely ruin it, it would do very well to reveal more of the back story on this character. Why does he kill? When did he lose his sanity? The murders are clever and unique and it has been such an incredibly long time since I have seen a original story such as this. I highly recommend anyone wanting to see a terrifying murder mystery to check out this film and Seven as well. Both these movies stand alone as truly great piece of cinema and will stand the test of time as classics. 8.5/10",Null,0,0,31 October 2004
Mama," A creepy and dark fairy tale of sorts that succeeds in its goal
","I really looked forward to seeing Mama. The trailers intrigued me and I'm always looking for a really good horror flick. The tone for Mama is set almost immediately. Its dark and creepy and sad and full of intensity. It has all the ingredients of a great horror flick including some cheap thrills that made me gulp and jump (something horror movies rarely do to me anymore.) I would have loved to have seen this in the theatre because watching it at home loses some of those thrills. Still, the movie is perfectly creepy and makes your skin crawl. The mystery of the story and the meaning behind it all keeps you on the edge of your seat. I thought the film did drag more than a little towards the end and they struggled to really find new material to keep it at the customary feature length. Mama felt like a one trick pony at times and I expected more from it at times. My only other complaint is the actual monster that is Mama looks very fake at times. I'm not a big fan of overusing blatant CGI and instead of keeping Mama more mysterious and in the shadows they opt to use really obvious CGI special effects. Now don't get me wrong, because this was a decent horror flick with a good story and some good performances but it didn't blow me away.Let it be known that I can't stand Jessica Chastain! Unfortunate for me since she's in every movie that gets released anymore. I don't understand why critics and fans alike think she's so great? She was deplorable in Zero Dark Thirty (an over-rated film anyways) and whoever cast her in this needs their head examined. Granted, she doesn't completely butcher the role (shockingly) but why would they cast her as a wild young 'punk' chick with edge? She isn't believable at it and I think a younger actress could have done this much better. Still she finds her footing towards the end and actually turns in a decent performance. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is good as the determined Uncle. My only complaint here is that I think he is underused and I would have rather the story focused on him than Chastain but I am biased I suppose. His chemistry with Chastain is okay but nothing miraculous. The performances that are noteworthy in this film belong to two young girls. Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nélisse are absolutely fantastic! They are dark and creepy and full of emotion. Nélisse especially gives a performance that should go into the horror annals right up there with Linda Blair in The Exorcist. They are such a vital part of the story and they hold their own in a big way. Daniel Kash is decent in his role as Dr. Dreyfuss but sort of underused as well like Coaster-Waldau.Mama is a sight to behold in many ways. There are some incredibly creepy and well done scenes that you won't soon forget. The controversial ending (and I say controversial because many did not like it) seems at first to be overdone in many ways. It suddenly feels like a sci-fi epic instead of a horror flick and the music, and the cataclysmic climax on a cliff side at night, all feels almost too much for a horror flick but then at the same time I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Somehow in the context of this story, it worked. Director Andres Muschietti knows his story and how he wants to tell it and does it in a terrific way. Mama will keep you constantly guessing and constantly freaked out and that's the best you can ask for from a creepy movie. I am normally the first one that would encourage sequels especially to horror films but I'm not sure they could ever do another one of this and do it justice. 8/10",8,0,2,4 May 2013
Super 8," A little of this and a little of that but overall a solid fun monster movie experience
","What would you get if you mixed the imagination and story telling of JJ Abrams with the imagination and story telling of the legendary Steven Spielberg? Super 8 that's what. You can see Super 8's tell tale inspirations from a mile away. Part E.T., Part Close Encounters, part Cloverfield, Part War of the Worlds. There is a little bit of everything rolled into one and add a coming of age story, a 70's small town setting, and a group of relate-able youngsters and you have a film that will just generally make you feel good, get excited and really enjoy every minute. Its the perfect summer, popcorn flick and there is not a thing wrong with that. It isn't quite a family film as it definitely has some dark moments, and some scary creatures but it also isn't a throw-down violent space flick either so there is a little something for everyone. Many reviews have some very common threads. Many say that there is some time based plot holes (Rubix Cube couldn't have been there, a song that was too early to be in the picture) but this is Abrams and Spielberg and their story is so well told and the adventure is so much fun that someone looking for pure entertainment can let these things slide. I certainly never thought once about any glaring plot holes. Not that there weren't any but more that I didn't care.The urban legend is that Joel Courtney came to stay with family for the summer, ended up auditioning and landing his first role as the lead character in a JJ Abrams film. Not bad for a newcomer but I promise you this isn't the last you've seen of this kid. He has such a fresh face, and a down to earth look about him and his character is perfect in the role reminiscent of E.T.'s Elliot so many years ago. You can just sit there and think of him as you when you were coming of age (in the seventies with Aliens...it happened to us all.) Elle Fanning who is no stranger to acting gives a truly great performance as the slightly rebellious but sweet Alice who basically is meant to be the first love of every young boy and is for Courtney's character. They are cute together and have good chemistry. Riley Griffiths is terrific in a supporting role as Courtney's best friend and the man behind the lens making the 'zombie' movie with his Super 8. He doesn't stand out compared to Courtney and Fanning but I think he is meant to support them. Same could be said for Ryan Lee who plays their other friend. He has a smaller supporting role but is still vital to the story. Kyle Chandler is Courtney's father and the grieving widower and the town Sheriff. Cleverly his adult character does not overshadow the kids, they are the main characters but at the same time adults need someone to relate to, the protector, the hero and Chandler is perfect as the quiet strength behind everything. He has an emotion and a strength about it and does well.The cast all around is good. They aren't mind blowing, they won't hear '...and best performer goes to...' but the fact is Super 8 is about the story. Yes the characters are integral to that but the story is where it lies. This is a story about a bizarre situation and a mysterious entity, and eventually a monster that is taking people prisoner. When all is said and done we discover that ultimately this 'monster' isn't so bad, in fact he's just angry and wants to go home. Super 8 plays a similar game to Cloverfield or other 'monster' movies and that is not showing you the monster until they absolutely have to. Certainly this makes for some terrific drama, and intensity and mystery but JJ Abrams knows all too well it can also open the door for huge disappointment when something is finally revealed. He dealt with this on Lost for 6 seasons. But the cool thing about Super 8 is I don't think anyone will be disappointed with the monster. He fits what you could picture, he is mysterious and disturbing and I didn't feel at all that it was disappointing. Plus the concept of his ship and putting it together makes for a very cool twist. If you want to see a great summer film don't miss this one! A terrific and fun adventure/Sci-fi flick that could become a must see classic! 9/10",Null,0,0,14 July 2011
Sinister," Sinister delivers creepy chills with an empty ending
","Certainly the October month is crowded with horror films. Sinister does manage to bring a certain unique quality to the genre and provides a story that could be easily spread over multiple films although its also not the type of horror flick that would normally get a sequel. The suspense is good and it doesn't leave you to a long elaborate build up but instead jumps right into the plot and the chills. The film has a solid story, good lore to the whole concept, decent performances, just all around a well done, entertaining and downright creepy flick. I think its the type of film that Stephen King would absolutely love. It reeks of his style (and that's a big compliment!) Struggling writer, paranormal circumstances, small town, and perhaps most importantly a man who progressively is losing his grip on sanity and reality throughout the course of the film. The only issue with the movie is perhaps they create too big of a potential story arc for one movie to handle so some of the details gets left behind.Ethan Hawke is excellent, really top notch as the determined writer, husband and father. In a short amount of time you can actually see the insanity of this paranormal entity getting to him. He fits his character well and basically single-handedly carries the film star wise. Juliet Rylance plays his devoted but frustrated wife. She is sort of understated in the film, her character is not well developed and is really just there to be support to his character. Michael Hall D'Addario and Clare Foley do a great job as Hawke's children. They are both very convincing and really have some great moments in the film. Considering the direction the film takes they should have had a more leading role in the movie. James Ransone is good as 'Deputy so and so' as he's known. He doesn't have a huge role but him and Hawke have good chemistry and his character is integral to the story. I very much would have liked to have seen more from Vincent D'Onofrio who has an uncredited role as Professor Jonas, the expert. So much more could have been done with his character.Sinister does not use the biggest horror fad now of hand cam, 'this is real' type direction and yet it does. It works it in there by using the old home videos that Hawke finds. This brings us full circle and will actually make you feel creeped out again by the home movie style of direction. Director Scott Derrickson's first film was a bonafide horror classic 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose.' While Sinister doesn't quite match how great that was, you can still tell the man knows how to tell a solid story. If the only thing I can say bad about this is that I wanted more than they did a great job. Sinister delivers everything you'd expect from the trailers and descriptions. Its a good solid horror flick. The ending is supposed to be a twist although I don't think it really shocked me all that much and it will certainly leave lots of questions in your mind. Well worth the price of admission this Halloween! 8/10",8,0,0,30 October 2012
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," A worthy sequel that believes if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
","Both Home Alone and Home Alone 2 are films very near and dear to my heart. I fell in love with them when I was a youngster and they have always been a permanent staple in my yearly movie watching. Home Alone is probably in my top ten films of all time and what sequel could live up to that? Well...this one. It isn't as good and it has its faults but they took everything that made the first a near instant classic and kept the key elements the same. When you look at Home Alone 2 up close you'll see that it really is just the first film rehashed but isn't that the idea of a sequel? The key is that the filmmakers needs to make sure they do it right. I feel like they did it very right. It has the same heart, the same level of fun, and the same carefree fantasy aspect of a young person on their own. I will say that I feel like Home Alone 2 amps up the violence to an almost extreme level. Certainly younger people watching this need to be told just how 'fantasy' this film is because he does some pretty wild pranks to Marv and Harry this time around. There are some terrific supporting roles, plenty of laughs and of course that heart and soul that is Home Alone and will actually bring tears to your eyes.Macaulay Culkin returns two years later and demonstrates again how terrific his chemistry was on screen. I said the same thing about Home Alone and that is Culkin wasn't and isn't a great actor. In fact, much of his performance in both films is very stiff and awkward and yet you rarely notice it. He has an indescribable charm and I remember as a youngster completely relating to him and loving every minute of his adventures. This was the perfect role for him. Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern return as everyone's favourite bufoonish criminals. They are truly terrific and I think this is one of Pesci's best roles because it is fun. He is still a worthy villain and just embodies the role so well. You actually do fear him even though he's a bumbling idiot who gets pranked right into prison. And Stern is similar only an even bigger idiot and the two of them together are terrific. Catherine O'Hara and John Heard return as Kevin's parents who ridiculously leave him behind yet again. O'Hara and Heard are perfect for this series and they do such a great job with mostly small roles. They are just the perfect all-American parents. The supporting cast is far more diverse and significant than the first film and they are all really great. Tim Curry and Rob Schneider are both amazing in this and it is insanely fun watching them get pranked. I find them both irritating quite often but in this they are just perfect. Brenda Fricker does a great job as the pigeon lady that Kevin befriends and the very small role by Eddie Bracken is also great.You can't expect much less than something truly terrific with a script penned by John Hughes and a film directed by Christopher Columbus. I mean these two guys together are gold when it comes to family films or capturing emotion in a coming of age/youthful sort of way. I've actually seen nearly every film Columbus has done and they all range from really good to amazing so the guy knows his genre absolutely. They knew what audiences loved about Home Alone and they gave them the exact same thing again with enough of a different story to make it stand on its own merits. I will say that Home Alone 2 feels a little less like a 'Holiday' movie than the first one did. Both are set at Christmas but I felt like this one didn't have quite the same Christmas feel to it perhaps because it was set in the big city instead of a home. Regardless if you like or love Home Alone then you can't help but at least enjoy this decent sequel. Its a little darker and a little less kiddie friendly (I happen to think both films aren't exactly right for the real young ones) but in my mind and in my house these will always be staples. 8.5/10",8,0,0,25 November 2013
Woman in Gold," A ton of potential lost on a clumsy script and direction
","Woman in Gold could have been this year's 'The Book Thief.' It has all the earmarks of being an amazing film that would be all over the awards but it won't be and it sort of came and went without anyone noticing. Why would that be? Simple. The film feels clumsy. The editing was not proper, the pacing is off, the performances feel jilted because of the editing and it misses the mark considering the potential behind it. Its still a good movie, some very strong moments where you really see how this could have shined and then in the same breath it misses a step and stumbles. I went from being bored, to being sincerely impressed, to being bored again and then by the end of the film everything feels very anti-climatic and because the film is so disjointed, the movie ends up being forgettable which is a true shame. Perhaps they could have focused more on the court case or the background story set during WWII but they sort of bounce around too much and never give the audience a chance to really sink themselves into the story. This is one of those movies that is especially frustrating because it isn't bad and it has these moments where it truly shines and it only serves to show you what could have been.The film has a very strong leading cast. Helen Mirren is a great actress of course and she is good in this role. I can't help but feel she doesn't quite give it her all but maybe that's all part of a poor script or direction. Ryan Reynolds also gives a strong dramatic performance as the lawyer who finds himself drawn into her case. His character is actually more complex than what you might think and he has a personal tie to the background with his grandfather and he has a couple of really good emotional scenes. He and Mirren are very good together and its sort of reminiscent of a Philomena kind of relationship but doesn't come close to that film. Katie Holmes is okay but very underused as Reynold's wife. I happen to think Holmes is a good actress given the chance but this role is very very small. Tatiana Maslany (I adore her) plays the young Maria (Mirren's character) She is good but the story doesn't give her enough either but she certainly gets the majority of the intense story. Daniel Bruhl, Max Irons and Charles Dance are supporting characters that are very sparingly used and don't get a chance to really stand out.I often notice with directors that spend a lot of time in Television, like Simon Curtis, that they have trouble pacing a two hour film versus unfolding a plot over multiple episodes. Woman In Gold is a good movie. Its a solid dramatic piece that is entertaining enough and tells a good story and a powerful one and the reason I find myself saying more bad than good is because the potential here was so great and it ends up being very forgettable and that's hard to get past. Still check it out for Mirren and Reynolds and for an interesting story based on fact. Just go in with reserved expectations. 7/10",7,0,0,3 August 2015
Invincible," How does Disney keep doing this!! I love it!!
","Miracle, The Greatest Game Ever Played and NOW THIS!! I don't even like Football but Invincible is the perfect feel good film. Right out of the gate I must say that I do not agree with it's 'G' rating. How can something like The Incredibles get a PG rating for violence and intense scenes but Invincible with a love scene, a scene of someone giving the middle finger twice, and a lot of violent football scenes gets a G?? There is no justice to the MPAA. BUT that being said Invincible truly is a story about overcoming fears and heroism and the film reminded me a great deal of the closest thing to Rocky I that has ever been done and yet that's a big compliment. First and foremost this film also takes place in Phillidelphia in the seventies so the setting and time feels very familiar to Rocky fans. You have a neighborhood guy that the entire city gets behind and all their dreams are in him. I am not a football fan but you honestly don't need to be. You will still find yourself rooting for this underdog. You also have a sub-plot of a serious recession that is taking it's toll on everyone in the lower income areas of Philly. You have a 'family', a group of friends so close that spend their time at a local pub and lean on each other in the rough times.Mark Wahlberg headlines the cast as substitute teacher, and football fan Vince Papale. I was never a fan of Wahlberg's despite some decent roles but in the last couple of years he has really impressed me with roles in the fantastic Four Brothers and now this. He shows some really impressive depth and character development. This is a role he can be really proud of because it's an important role that he does great in. Greg Kinnear plays new Phillidelphia Eagles coach Dick Vermeil who struggles with trying to be a brilliant coach for a losing team. This is the best role I've seen Kinnear play in a very long time. I think he's a great actor but some of his roles have been questionable at best. Still I don't think the story delved into Coach Vermeil enough but for what they gave us Kinnear did terrific. Elizabeth Banks plays Wahlberg's new love interest Janet Cantrell. She plays a great role, although rather small she does the most with it. She's strikingly beautiful, and delivers some laughs in her New York Giants fan role living in Philly. Her and Wahlberg have good chemistry but with better character development it could have been GREAT chemistry. Michael Rispoli plays one of the best supporting characters Max Cantrell. He owns the bar where everyone hangs out. He's always there for everyone and is like a brother to Wahlberg's character. He stands out more than everyone else on the supporting cast because of his strong personality and screen time. The rest of the supporting cast is terrific too. Kirk Acevedo, Dov Davidoff, Michael Kelly and Sal Darigo all play small but really great roles. They all have small sub plots whether it be trouble with their wives, finding a job, being laid off and they all do such a great job of bringing you into the story. They all set a tone and that is truly what carries Invincible.For a first time big screen director Ericson Core does an amazing job because this film really does get much of it's charm from it's direction. In many ways the film is very bleak and foreboding but that makes Wahlberg's triumph all the more important in the end. Does the film follow a stale recipe?? Sure in some ways but for most people who love to feel great at a film you won't care that you've seen this before because this is new characters, strong actors and a moving, brilliant TRUE story. I don't know how some reviewers can say the emotion felt forced, or that scenes felt tacked together because I didn't for a minute feel the emotion was forced. Quite the opposite emotions ran high from one extreme to another and the scenes on the football field added into the action and watch-ability. I only don't score it perfect because at this point it is an old recipe and I felt like there should have been more story there but they did an incredible job and right now you won't find a better film to make you feel inspired and touched in the theaters. Go see it!! 9/10",9,1,1,29 August 2006
National Treasure," Deserving of the number one spot! Spoiler alert!
","There is nothing like a great action film that leaves you high as a kite when you leave the theatre. You want to let go of reality for a couple hours and just enjoy an adventure. National Treasure is a movie with an incredibly unfortunate name!! Upon first seeing the trailer for this movie I was gripped to my seat until I saw the title...YUCK!! But fortunately for this title laden movie it kicks some serious butt!!National Treasure is the story of Ben Franklin Gates, the ancestor of a long line of Gates family men who have hunting for the world's greatest treasure.Ben's Grandfather revealed to him as a young boy the only clue they have in their possession and it begins an obsession for Ben to find this treasure that his grandfather and his father spent decades searching for. Only Ben has figured out how to decipher the clue that his Grandfather gave him and it leads his crew into the depths of the Artic Circle. Unfortunately Ben's team and friends turn on him leaving him for dead when they discover the map to the treasure is on none other than the back of the declaration of Independence. Now in order to protect the declaration Ben Gates and his last friend from the crew must steal it away from the bad guys to protect it and find the treasure first. Along for the ride, unwillingly at first is the beautiful Dr. Chase and eventually Ben's father who had long given up on the treasure.I always say I'm not a Nick Cage fan but the truth is I love most films he does. Maybe it's just the way he picks his scripts but his action movies are some of the best movies...Con Air, The Rock, Face-Off and many more. He is one of those actors who acting ability doesn't stretch too far from character to character. At least in his action movies he's basically the same character but that's enough to have a great time watching. National Treasure is an Indiana Jones type adventure but set in the United States which is very different for an adventure film. Most adventure films if not all need to go to some foreign, exotic location to make it believable but National Treasure happens right on our front door step. The film takes us from the Arctic Circle to Washington DC, to Boston, to Philladelphia, to New York, all around North America and it's fun and feels like you're treasure hunting with them. Add in some crazy chase scenes, a killer thieving caper scene with the Declaration and some amazing spots in the US.The storyline is interesting, original, and very captivating. They use real life things to change it into clues for the treasure ie. 1 dollar bills, and the liberty bell and things on the Declaration. The cast is awesome. Sean Bean is as always an excellent bad guy reminiscent of his role on Don't Say A Word, another amazing movie. Diane Kruger as Dr. Chase is wonderful first not believing Ben's plot and then becoming an unwilling participant to becoming a full blown co-hort and the leading lady to Nick's leading man of course. Appearances by Jon Voight and Christopher Plummer add some great class to the movie. Voight plays a very different character from his others. He's soft spoken, elderly, and shy and unsure of himself. A far cry of some his other rather loud roles he has played. Plummer's brief appearance is a nice cameo as well.This is a great movie, one of the best of the year I think as far as action films go. Definitely don't hesitate to check this one because you will not be disappointed. I don't see them doing any future Ben Gate's films but it wouldn't be difficult to do another as he is a swashbuckling hero and rich too :)9/10",Null,1,1,29 November 2004
Reservoir Dogs," How wrong I was about Tarantino and how brilliant this film is
","I think I've started every Tarantino review I've done so far with this same statement. Somehow I got this pre-conceived notion in my head that I hated Tarantino and all his films. I thought he tried too hard to be original and different and used gratuitous nudity, violence, language just for the sake of doing it and then I accidentally got sucked in by Kill Bill and I have been more of a convert every day. So finally I sat down to watch the classic that is Reservoir Dogs which I think might be one of the smartest and most stylish films in Hollywood. The entire film is based on a huge heist that you never see, with some characters you hardly get to know, with a deep history that you never really get the full background of, and a setting that is 98% in an empty warehouse room and yet is incredibly brilliant. The script is so sharp and intelligent and although CHOCK full of horrendous four letter words but you get in the jive with who these guys are and what's happening and who is who and it just sucks you in. So much of the film relies so heavily on the dialog and it's just riveting in the way it is presented. The actors in this film are kind of a who's who of brilliant character actors who have done piles of films and this is kind of their piece de resistance because they give their all and should have received academy award nominations. Some of them give their best performances I have ever seen.Academy Award nominee Harvey Keitel plays Mr. White, the down to earth, analytical and almost concerned thief who arrives at the warehouse first. Keitel is amazing and easily one of the strongest performers in the film. He has a really interesting character and even though he is bad, and an all around villainous character he might be the one you feel the most empathy for. Tim Roth spends most of the film bleeding to death on the floor and yet has a really interesting back story and a major part in the entire film. His performance is perhaps a little more subtle but equally as brilliant. Steve Buscemi, who I have always thought has been a very versatile and brilliant actor, gives literally the performance of his lifetime as Mr. Pink. He's almost the middle man, the neutral guy between everyone and is trying to play it safe so that he doesn't get burnt by the other mystery guys he's working with. Buscemi is wide eyed, and loud and just really puts some excitement into the entire story with a really over the top and incredible performance. Chris Penn has a smaller role but still adds to the cast as choreographer of the whole heist Eddie Cabot. While he doesn't get quite the screen time or dialog that any of the other characters do he still comes across as the biggest villain to the other 'color' characters (Pink, White, Blue etc.) I saved the best for last. I've seen Michael Madsen in SO many roles over the years and he's always decent but I have never seen him pull off anything the way he pulled off his role as Mr. Blonde. Blonde is just a psychotic killer and Madsen makes you down right petrified of him. He's smooth and quiet, and rough and then he lets loose this incredibly demented side and has one of the greatest moments in movie history as he tortures someone while dancing to seventies music. Madsen should have gotten an Academy Award instantly for this role!! He is a terrific character actor with well over 70 roles to his credit.Music and mood plays such a huge part in this film. I don't believe it takes place in any other time than modern day but Tarantino seems to go out of his way to make you feel like the film is in the seventies. The music and the montages and the way it plays such an important part to everything. The cars look retro, the clothing is ambiguous to any time period and even just the feel of the film. It's got this gangster/heist/mob feel to it like no other film I've ever seen. The blood flows freely and there is a lot of really sick scenes and it's certainly not for the squeamish or PG fans because Reservoir Dogs is the definition of 'R' rated but still for an adult film of it's kind it stands out. There is a lot of mystery surrounding it...both kind of plot hole, strangeness like how Chris Penn's character gets shot in a triangle of shooters and what happens to Mr. Pink after he flees but these questions will remain as part of the greatness that is the classic film Reservoir Dogs. 9.5/10",9,1,3,3 September 2007
The Great Raid," Valid attempt but not big screen material
","When I saw this on my shelves at my local video store I was immediately drawn to it. Benjamin Bratt who I've become a fan due to his recent Television work in E-Ring, James Franco, World War 2, rescue mission, sounded like a gem to me and I wasn't disappointed by any means but on a budget of seventy million dollars I was a little surprised by the little better than made-for-TV quality of film. I don't know if it was released commercially although I assume on a budget of that size it would have been but there was most definitely something missing to make it that big screen magic.For the most part the story is quite interesting. A group of American POW's who have spent the last three years in a grueling Japanese work camp where they are tortured and dying off one by one. Nearby a new batch of well trained Rangers led by Lt. Colonel Mucci is preparing to launch a daring rescue mission to save them all. The Film shows us two sides to the story although attempts to show three. The first side is the Rangers as they prepare and carry out their rescue mission which gives most of the action element. James Franco plays Captain Prince who is in charge of planning this raid and making sure everything goes off without a single hitch. Franco brings his usual intensity to the screen and does a decent job but his character is mostly empty without any real substance. Same with Benjamin Bratt, who plays Lt. Colonel Mucci. It's like he's there just to be a name to the film (and he's not even that much of a name) but his character is more or less completely vapid with no background or real point. They try to establish him with the talk from the other soldiers but it never really takes hold. I don't blame Bratt or Franco but just a poorly written character arc. The second side to the story and the more focused and interesting is that of the American POW's. Sadly I can't remember or figure out which actor played the leader of the POW's but he does a great job and probably the best in the film. Heartbroken about being away from his lady love, struck with malaria, and desperate to keep his men alive and hopes up his performance is emotional and touching. Connie Nielsen plays his lady love who is working on the outside to smuggle supplies and much needed medicine to the POW's but it's getting harder to do so and the Japanese are on to the Underground resistance. The third side of the film tries to be (but fails) the side of the Filipinos who work side by side with American Rangers to help them get the POW's. In my mind it would seem that they put their lives on the line in a big way to help but the film didn't really focus on them despite the fact that they faced the biggest casualties and were far more targeted than the Americans. There was much more story to be told.Director John Dahl has a style that tends to be a little vapid. His previous work doesn't have a lot of depth or real meat to it and for a film of this magnitude dealing with a historical moments of this caliber I don't think he was the right choice. However all said and done it's not a bad movie at all. It has it's moments, and the action and the Raid itself is intense and well done and the scenery and setting is gripping and gut wrenching but scenes of torture and death don't really tug at your heart strings because it's not handled with the delicacy and style that it needed to be. It's worth seeing but it won't stick with you for long, it's mostly forgettable especially in a day and age when there is some truly stupendous WWII films out there. 7/10",7,0,4,15 January 2006
Total Recall," One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time
","Total Recall is one of many films that made Arnold Schwarzenegger exactly what he is...an action superstar. Not only that but Total Recall is exactly what it was set out to be a sci-fi epic from the fantastic mind of writer Philip Dick (Paycheque, Minority Report.) Total Recall takes the sci-fi film to epic proportions and makes it almost fantasy like. The biggest difference between Dick's stories compared to some other sci-fi writers like Gene Rodenberry is that Dick's future doesn't try to be accurate. Total Recall could happen in another reality altogether. There is a fantasy like epic to it.Another one of the great things about Total Recall is it was made in a time before CGI become so dominant. The special effects are resoundingly real, painstakingly created, things are not 'faked.' The world they create is dark, gloomy, futuristic, very gritty. The film takes you from Earth to Mars, and creates two very different types of setting for each planet. The film is not about the technology or the future or the planets, these things are just normal ideas for the characters in the film...Total Recall is about Douglas Quaid played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. Starting out as a regular every day Joe and eventually leading him to a former life where he existed as a killing machine, a secret agent, and a major player in a government conspiracy. Everything unfolds at perfect speed and this film is the definition of non-stop action. The chases, the shootouts, the incredible fight scenes and the extreme goriness of it all like only an eighties 'R' Rated film could do. They don't make movies like this period!! The film is chock full of no holds barred gore. The death scenes are brutal and some of the special effects are just stunning. The effect used to warp the faces of humans who breath the martian air is shocking and disturbing and funny all at once. The characters are very real and strong but mostly focusing on Quaid. Schwarzenegger easily holds his own in the film but the rest of the cast is quite good too. Sharon Stone in a pre-Basic Instinct role as the conniving wife of Quaid who turns out to be his enemy. Their fights and her skills as an action star are just awesome. Michael Ironside in his usual bad guy role is good as well but it's not a stretch for him as he's used to this kind of role. Rachel Ticotin as Schwarzenegger's love interest also does a decent enough job. Just like they're are Bond girls, I also like to think there is Eighties Action Girls. Top Gun had Kelly McGillis, RoadHouse had Kelly Lynch and so on...they aren't great actresses but they are used as more eye candy than anything else. But she does an alright job. This film really is made great by the script and Schwarzenegger. It's a Star Wars level epic about the future and this man. It is hands down an absolute must see for Sci-fi fans!! It truly is one of the best action films ever!! It was quite simply awesome!! 9/10",9,0,2,22 October 2005
Rocky," Unmatched, brilliant, an absolute masterpiece of cinema history
","Many wonder how Sylvester Stallone got his film career but anyone who has truly seen and loved 'Rocky' knows exactly how. Stallone created and wrote the entire story and character of Rocky Balboa, who turns out to be one of the great cinema characters of all time and even though as a kid I always loved the sequels even more than the original...looking back nothing compares to this original classic where Stallone completely embodies this 'underdog' character. Rocky is so incredible lovable and relate-able and you just can't get enough and you become so completely fascinated with his life and his romance and everything he has done to fight his way to the top that by the time the match comes about you are practically on your feet rooting for him. Add to that the gritty, and melancholy setting of Philladelphia projects that begin to feel just like home as it is for Rocky. Stallone has always said that 'Rocky' was more than anything else a love story between him and Adrien and it really is now that I watch it for the purpose of reviewing it. Everything that happens in his life is for her and he adores her and his simple minded, laid back manner mixed with his brute strength and determination is unparalleled in films.Sylvester Stallone not only wrote the screenplay but takes the infamous lead as Rocky Balboa. It might be one of the greatest performance I have ever seen because Stallone IS Balboa, no one could EVER replace him in this role. He has the personality, and the little things that make Rocky so real and so incredibly likable. He is the most unlikely hero and yet at the same time one the greatest heroes. I don't know how he wasn't awarded the Oscars who was nominated for (Two one in acting and one in writing that year) but it was sheer robbery because he was amazing!! But don't count out this incredible ensemble cast including Talia Shire as the shy and constantly changing Adrian Pennino, who goes through an incredible metamorphosis in personality and life style as she falls in love with this rough around the edges fighter who never gives up...especially on her. Shire never quite captured the original spirit she put into her performance as Adrien. Burt Young also never did such an amazing job as he did with his original performance as brash, violent, outspoken and alcoholic brother of Adrien, Paulie. He is one of the most memorable supporting characters and his performance is brilliant. Burgess Meredith is a classic performer in his role as angry, tough as nails trainer Mickey Goldmill who treats Rocky like crap but only in the end to show it's for his own good. Meredith complements Stallone's soft spoken and non-confrontational Rocky. And Carl Weathers is amazing as Rocky's ultimate foe, the best of the best in professional boxing and basically the polar opposite of Balboa's personality Apollo Creed. Creed is loud, and flamboyant and fast and conceited and on top of that all he really has the skill. Weathers looks like a true pro in the ring and makes it all look like a real fight.Now let's talk about that fight. Every Rocky film builds up to 'THE FIGHT' but nothing compares to the build up for that original fight against Creed and when it finally breaks it's like everything else stops. You move to the edge of your seat, you yell at the screen, you cheer and cringe and every move is brilliantly choreographed. No real life boxing fight could ever be as intense as Creed and Balboa bashing it out like two men with desire like no other fighters. The fight is what brings tears to my eyes every single time this film makes me cry!! If the rest of the film is a 7 the fight alone rages it up to a 10/10. But the rest of the film is not a 7, it's such a vital part of the entire story and understanding everyone and it does unfold a little slowly but every piece is so meticulously and brilliantly created. And I can't conclude without mentioning the score. The music is something Rocky is also famous for and that Academy Award nominated song is enough to bring tears to your eyes just listening to it. This entire film is brilliant and classic and if you're reading this and have never seen it you have no idea what you're missing. It's one of the most subtly brilliant and entertaining films of all time, hands down. 10/10",10,4,7,26 December 2006
Beauty and the Beast," Expected a rehash and once again Disney surpasses expectations
","Say what you will about Disney but whomever is at the helm nowadays is brilliant. So far their live action renditions have brought in Billions. Beauty and The Beast might be the first of the truly modern day Animated classics they've 'rebooted' in a live action way. I thought it looked cool and was excited to see it but cautiously so because wouldn't it just be the same thing seen before in Animation? In short...yes. In long, it didn't matter! The direction, cinematography and seeing the classic fairy tale in live action makes it all the more impressive. It is perfectly cast and wonderfully performed. I found myself excited for the familiarity of some of the musical numbers and really enjoyed the story all over again. I saw a review or two that called the film trash for being liberal and I still can't wrap my head around that. I wish this over-PC world would calm itself and just enjoy something for a change. Disney is brilliant because they found a way to remake their classic films for a new generation but they also don't skimp on sheer quality. These films Beauty and The Beast included are magnificent with huge budgets so it is understandable why they're doing it and I will keep seeing them for sure!It seemed something of a controversy to cast Emma Watson but I think she does a very good job. I think she is finally breaking the mould that was the Harry Potter franchise. She is really perfect as Belle. It's not exactly a meaty part and she's beautiful and headstrong and makes for a good heroine. Dan Stevens is excellent as The Beast. He is as good as his animated counterpart from years ago. He perfectly captures the personality and torment and still shows some fierce loyalty to Belle. Their chemistry together is perfect for the film. It's not too intense but not understated either. In a film like this where the characters are iconic and so Disney-esque, the supporting cast is as important as ever. Luke Evans and Josh Gad are absolutely perfectly cast as the villainous Gaston and his henchman LeFou. Kevin Kline, Ewan McGregor, Ian McKellen, Emma Thompson (still would have loved to have seen Angela Landsbury return), Nathan Mack, Audra McDonald and Stanley Tucci all add something truly special to the film in their own way. Some of the more iconic characters (Lumiere and Cogsworth) are more understated I thought this time around but maybe that is okay for a live action film. Gaston is also more evil than he was in the animated version. Things are just turned up more in this version. It's a little darker, a little more vivid and large and a little more magic.Bill Condon was a very interesting choice for the director of Beauty and The Beast. He has a lot of experience but I wouldn't have expected him to be able to pull this off. He plays things very safely. He makes sure all the things that fans of Beauty and The Beast would expect BUT he also gives it just a little bit more to keep new fans and old fans locked into a whole new remake. It's a beautiful film and stands beside it's animated counterpart. Time will tell if it will be a classic as well. 8/10",8,2,9,9 May 2017
The Descent," A cult horror/thriller that lives up to its hype
","It is excruciatingly hard to be original when making films but its even harder to be original when you're trying to settle into a tried and true genre. As a fan, the horror genre is especially crowded and hard to fit into. You have good, bad, really bad and really really bad. People of every walk are making horror films for $10 and their phone or sinking millions into bid budget ghost flicks. Every once in awhile you find a horror flick that really stands out because of smart, cutting edge film making/writing and The Descent is exactly that. It isn't easy to truly get under a horror fan's skin and genuinely creep you out. The Descent's pacing is brilliant because you've got a group of girls, going exploring, almost feels like a survival '127 Days' type film and then horror, horror, horror! Not zombie, not monster, not slasher...and yet somehow all of that and more. Screaming and terror and isolation and dark, damp setting that just leaves you wide eyed and breathless. The Descent is one of those movies that I kept hearing about and seem to grow in reputation and when I sat down to watch it, I was expecting it not to live up to the hype but it does. It isn't quite what you'd consider a 'big budget' Hollywood flick and yet it definitely has no indication of being low budget.The best thing about this cast of girls is that they're all as good as each other. There really isn't one 'stand-out' performance to me and for this film in particular it works because you feel like you're part of their group. We still have a 'main' heroine, a scream queen so to speak played by Shauna Macdonald. She gets more story as we are shown what has traumatized her to end up on this trip. She is very good and very down to earth and all of these girls you just feel like they could be anyone and I mean that in the best of ways. Natalie Mendoza, Alex Reid, Saskia Mulder, Myanna Buring and Nora Jean No one are the other cave hunters and they have great chemistry with each other and they all have their purpose even if its to be fodder, they have distinctive personalities and you really believe their performances even if its just believing they are regular girls in a terrible situation.I've actually seen quite a bit of Neil Marshall's work and it doesn't surprise me that he's now helming a big budget Hollywood blockbuster (Skull Island.) He has a great story telling ability and makes you feel things no matter how implausible. He sets this film up like a nature survival story and then suddenly they're being picked up by mysterious cave monsters in bloody horrible ways. Its shocking, twisted, disturbing and really well made on what was probably a low budget. If you're looking for something that will genuinely creep you out this Halloween, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed. 8/10",8,1,3,30 October 2015
Some Like It Hot," Average in almost every way...don't stone me!!
","While I am a student of Political history and could recite many a Marilyn Monroe fact or conspiracy theory to you, I had yet to see her in one of her iconic films. So finally I sat down to watch what is generally considered one of the greatest film comedies of all time. That is a lot to live up to and I didn't realize just how popular the film was until I logged on here to write this review. 8.4 on IMDb?! Now, please don't get me wrong...I enjoyed this movie. It was fun and wild and absolutely I can see how and why it pushed the limits back then. I'm not sure I have seen so many analogies and innuendos in one film. They were being shoved down your throat like a case of mistaken identity on Three's Company. The first analogy or clever innuendo is a chuckle and not much else but after the twentieth...it gets tired. The setting of 1929 makes some pretty intense action/gangster scenes even for the time. It was almost shocking to watch it now and that was kind of a neat mix to the comedy. Some of the comedic moments are almost dark in nature. I was surprised that I didn't really feel a lot of the humour had homophobic undertones which I thought would be a certainty. If anything, the very last gag in the film is almost pro-gay in some ways and it was definitely worth a laugh.Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon were so young!! Curtis was handsome and fun and delivered his comedic moments perfectly. Lemmon was quirky and fun and certainly has legendary comedic timing. The two of them together are just awesome. A buddy film like this requires great chemistry and there is nothing short in their chemistry together. They seem like a bit of an odd-couple but they work great together. The stunning beauty of Marilyn Monroe and her sheer raw charisma on screen cannot be denied. When she first appears and every subsequent appearance you are just mesmerized. She's actually a much actress that I anticipated and her role is fun and breezy and perfectly performed by her. The chemistry between her and Curtis and even her and Lemmon is lacking. I didn't feel nearly any sparks between her and Curtis and that's really unfortunate. Romance is an important part of the film and it doesn't really fit well. George Raft is the perfect cookie cutter gangster. He is nothing more or less than the stereotypical 'Boss' we would expect from a gangster flick. Same for his crew as well. They could have been lifted right from Dick Tracey. Dave Barry was a great supporting actor and gave some great comedy as the angry but stumbling Beinstock. Joan Shawlee is also good as the band leader and mother hen Sweet Sue. I also really enjoyed the campy and fun character played by Joe E. Brown as the man who falls for Lemmon's Daphne.I have no doubt that to see the true brilliance behind the film you would have to look at from the perspective of 1959 films and the time period. The movie is set in 1929 and I couldn't help but notice the inconsistencies in the timing. Its small things but certain products that weren't available in 1929 (Cheese Whiz for one) or just certain dialect. Its a small thing but worth noting nonetheless. The comedy is definitely balanced out by the more violent scenes in the film so it almost turns out a darker comedy that doesn't always fit the slapstick tone and concept of the movie. It is a fun movie and certainly is a classic that shows up on many lists of being a top film. I don't necessarily agree with that but who am I to deny a film that has stood up to 50+ years. For me, it didn't floor me but it was entertaining. 6.5/10",6,0,5,12 August 2013
Inside Man," Sorry folks...my first big Collassal disappointment of 2006
","I thought The Inside Man was a sure fire enjoyable film. How could they miss?? Great, strong leading cast, seemingly flawless action/heist film with some good twists and maybe a mystery to boot. I was psyched to see it, one of my first big anticipations of this year and unfortunately it let me down. I seem to be one of the few as it garnishes rave reviews from IMDb viewers and continues to rake in the money. What can I say?? I found Spike Lee's latest attempt at an intellectual action film campy, poorly delivered and put together, and completely utterly confusing. I'm still not sure the entire basis of the story except pieces here and there. I have not seen a lot of Spike Lee 'joints' but the few I have seen his style appears to be a non-conformist, mish-mashed, play on regular chronological order ex: Son of Sam, 25th Hour. Both of which I felt a little confused during. Perhaps my 'intellectuality' I don't know?? The amazing if not slightly pontificating Denzel Washington takes the lead role as newcomer Hostage negotiator Keith Frazier, and unless you looked on here I don't know if you'd ever know his characters name. Nonetheless Washington pretty flawlessly makes any role watchable with his intense acting ability and his sometimes frantic portrayal of men under stress. Washington is the films saving grace and even though his humility leaves something to be desired (the man reeks of knowing how good he is) he's still an amazing leading man. Clive Owen is his adversary Dalton Russell and under normal circumstances this would have been a match made in Heaven. Owen is becoming a great leading man in his own right having really impressed me in Derailed, King Arthur and even one of my less favorites Closer. Owen spends the majority of the film behind a mask which could be perfectly fine but none of the characters in the film are ever really explored or opened up which makes operating behind a mask even more difficult. His true genius is left untapped and his character is left completely undiscovered sadly. Same with Washington's character who has a great back story that is just never explored with any real class or expertise. Still with what Owen is given he does his best and plays a great bad guy but still in some ways an anti-hero. Jodie Foster plays conniving black market mediator to the rich and famous Madeline White. In actuality she IS the Inside Man. Her role is without a doubt the best in the film and the most developed. In many ways she is more the villain than Owen's character. She's devious and underhanded and is more about the money than anyone and at the same time because of her line or work she has some very powerful connections even if those connections despise her for the work she has done. Foster is tight knit, no holds barred, and easily believable as a man-eater or people eater in general. Christopher Plummer as the aging bank executive who is on the receiving end of the robber's bitterness does a decent job but his role is equally unflourished and it goes to waste in the end. Another great actor Willem Dafoe goes to complete waste as the seemingly bored Captain John Darius. His role is so small despite having a lot of screen time and he just seems like he doesn't want to be there. Chiwetel Ejiofor who did such a great job as the bad guy in Four Brothers is made into Denzel Washington's lackey, following him around like a puppy dog and never doing much of anything except being Washington's straight man.Nobody from this film is the problem with the film. Everyone does the best job they can with what they are given with a poorly slapped together script. The story makes little to no sense and desperately needs so much more explaining and depth and maybe it all ended up on the cutting room floor but for me it ruined it completely. What started out as an intense action film began to spiral into completely and utter non sensical story. The heist wasn't clever, it was confusing because we as the audience knew even less about what was going on than the people involved. The interspersed interviews with witnesses and possible suspects DURING the bank robbery was even more confusing and leaving the film in chronological order would have been much neater and easier to follow. There were small little moments when I wondered why in the hell they decided to do such little things that made the film look downright fake. There is a scene where the female robber is guarding the vault and she is swaying back and forth like a cartoon castle guard?!!? It looks ridiculous!! What should have been a very real and intense and incredibly clever heist film was a brutally confusing and misused and poorly directed and written crap film that was only saved and marginally watchable by it's high priced and high priority cast. It had it's moments where I thought everything was going to come together but it never did and when those credits started rolling my disappointment began rolling in. I won't tell anyone NOT to see this movie, in fact I would say enjoy my review let it fire you up if you like it because everyone seems to love this film. It just wasn't for me and disappointed me a great deal, no one is more saddened than me to not have loved it. 5/10",5,18,31,10 April 2006
Jack Reacher," A well made and fascinating flick that keeps you entertained beginning to end
","First of all I have to say how sick and tired I am of hearing from the people that didn't like this film about how Tom Cruise doesn't fit the physical description of Jack Reacher...GET OVER IT!! I have not read any of the Reacher books, although I may start now, but I promise that I couldn't care less whether Cruise fits the physical description of Reacher and Lee Childs doesn't either (supposedly.) When you start to dissect this film and you're sitting there being completely and utterly entertained beginning to end, you see a sheer brilliance in the film making and an incredibly unique experience that will thrill movie goers. Consider this part mystery, part thriller, part 70's Grindhouse, part dark comedy, part action and romantic tension and you have everything you could possibly need to make an outstanding first rate film. They probably did take liberties in creating the film version of Jack Reacher but you have to sometimes and I completely understand wanting more from your favourite literary character but give this film a chance on its own merits and you'll be completely entertained. For the most part it is receiving very good reviews and for good reason. The action scenes at times feel a little forced in order to keep the pace going but still perfectly executed. Reacher is a complete bad-ass and you will root for him at every turn. He's dark, mysterious, angry and brilliant and he makes for a unique and entertaining hero.I've never stopped liking Tom Cruise as an actor. I think he embodies Hollywood stardom and has for decades. He is easily one of my favourite actors and I couldn't care less about her personal life or religious beliefs. I think he gets a lot of bad press but he performs on screen with very little ego. Becoming Reacher for him is flawless. Delivering his darkly comic one liners is easy and flows for him. The dialogue in this film is so witty and clever and the banter is almost too fast to keep up with but its so easy for Cruise and he nails this role and leads the cast to epic conclusion. Rosamund Pike in many ways feels like a 'Bond' girl to Cruise's Reacher. She's beautiful and her reactions to things are almost campy (many things in the film are purposely campy but I'll get to that in a moment.) There is absolutely no doubt that the director carefully plans camera shots to revolve around Pike's cleavage and body and face to sexualize her and yet the character is not overtly sexual. The tension between her and Cruise is brilliant and yet they never actually solidify any romance. It keeps the tension throughout the film. Richard Jenkins is a great character actor and he has a decent role as Pike's DA father but the role is small and he barely gets any good lines so he is sort of left in the dust in an otherwise dialogue-smart film. David Oyelowo is decent as the detective butting heads with Reacher. He delivers a lot of monotony to the character so he certainly doesn't stand out amongst a strong leading cast. Legendary Hollywood actor and director Werner Herzog is the perfect villain. He too comes across as a 'Bond' type character and my only regret is that we don't see more of him. They sort of leave him a little underdeveloped but he is still a brilliant and downright evil villain. Jai Courtney is his number one man and our sniper. He plays a great role and the perfect adversary to Cruise's Reacher. Their fight is epic and they both play a key role in a truly outstanding car chase scene (the best I have seen since the Bourne films.) Robert Duvall makes a late in the movie appearance in a great Hollywood legend type cameo and him and Cruise are terrific opposite each other. Duvall is used just the right amount.I would go so far to say that director and screenplay writer Christopher McQuarrie has created one of the best films of the year, at least the latter part of the year. Is it perfect? No. There are some less than stellar supporting performances and the very quick banter takes some getting used to. However, consider that he created a film with some purposely campy content, a film that is literally funny throughout and yet never takes away from the intensity or the darkness or the action. I think he pays homage to the drive in action films of the 70's and 80's and delivers some incredible cinematography. Parts of this film will make you feel like you are watching Dirty Harry (a great compliment in my opinion,) but then the film also feels a little like a good old fashion Schwarzenegger movie, or an old school mystery detective film. The movie goes through so many different iterations of genres that you will just find yourself completely entertained and that is the goal. The film is so smartly written. The constant back and forth and the way Reacher does his investigating is just a blast to watch. The film is fun, action packed (albeit the action scenes feel a little forced at times), sexy, savvy and the perfect movie theatre experience. Cruise fans can rest easy because this is him in top form. I hope it does well enough to warrant sequels because I want to see Jack Reacher again!! 9/10",9,5,12,28 December 2012
"McFarland, USA"," We've been here before but Disney knows the course well
","You can't swing a cat without hitting a 'based on real life' sports story usually about inner city youth or a struggling neighbourhood. They are uplifting films and I have enjoyed many of them. Disney has done some of the best ones out there and McFarland, USA fits that bill. Kevin Costner is one of my all time favourites and the reason why I saw this film. He doesn't disappoint and neither does the movie. You can't be disappointed in the film with low expectations because you have to know what to expect. The film is clean enough for most families although our theatre had it listed as 'G' Rated and I don't stand behind that at all. There was some minor cursing and the tone of the film is just a tad much to be G. It is still an inspiring story with great characters and while it does nothing to make itself stand apart from other films, it was well worth watching.Kevin Costner should be known as the sports actor by now. Three baseball films, golf, football and now this. I would hardly say this is his best performance but its still a solid go. He brings a lot of heart to the role and complexity to a simplistic part. The heart and soul of this film are really the boys that he coaches to success in track. Ramiro Rodriguez, Carlos Pratts, Johnny Ortiz, Rafael Martinez, Hector Duran, Sergio Avelar and Michael Aguero are all very good and have terrific chemistry together. They are believable and show a ton of emotion and really make this story come to life. Together with Costner, it is the perfect blend of personalities to make this effective. Maria Bello is okay but completely underused and underdeveloped as Costner's wife. Morgan Saylor is terrific as Costner's teenage daughter. She shows a lot of talent in her role and I think she is one to watch as she is also very good in Homeland too.Director Niki Caro gives a lot of heart to this film. You can see it and you can feel it. I think the only issue with this film is that we have seen it all before but don't let that steer you away from seeing it. If you enjoy this type of true life story or you want a good decent family film (with a little bit of bad language) then this is one you will certainly not regret seeing. Disney knows how to make these films and they will continue to be successful at it. This was as good as last year's Million Dollar Arm, maybe make these two a double feature. 8/10",8,2,14,9 April 2015
Les Misérables," Easily coins words like stunning and breathtaking, this is why movies are made!!
","This is actually the first time for me seeing Les Miserables. I think I read the book eons ago but I love musicals and I had extremely high expectations for this film which were met again and again. It wasn't perfect, I have a few negatives to mention but the absolute raw emotion and power and feeling of destitution made this easily one of the best movies of the year. The scenery was stunning, France was brilliantly and clearly painstakingly created. The gritty dark streets and sewers to the homes of the revolutionaries were all equally excellent. Les Mis as its affectionately known is a film that is 100% song from beginning to end. There are no spoken words of dialogue or at least such a minimum you wouldn't notice. The music is so powerful and moving and poetic that you will just hang on every single word sung, though I think the music is only as good as the person performing it which the lead cast is absolute perfection but more on that in a moment. The film is very long, but that is sort of to be expected given the content and the fact that it is a stage play. The first half of the film is significantly better than the first as is the entire cast better in the first half of the film than the second. I think they made some grievous casting errors in a couple of the roles that really drags down the latter half. But I look at this from a distance as a whole entity and it is brilliantly crafted, it had me in tears and just simply frozen in place for its nearly three hours.I liked Hugh Jackman before Les Mis, a lot actually, and I've always been impressed with his versatility and talents but I simply didn't understand the scope of his abilities. He is absolutely amazing in his lead role. He commands the screen at each step of the film and his chemistry and his passion just rip your heart out and pour out of the screen. The lack of Oscar nomination would be a travesty. There is only one single performance that matched and maybe even slightly outdid his own in this film and that was the equally stunning Anne Hathaway. If she needed one defining moment to permanently solidify her place as one of the biggest Hollywood stars of all time...this was it. Her rendition of I Dreamed a Dream will rip your guts out and should instantly have won her the best supporting actress Oscar. She was brilliant and every scene she was in just reeked of powerhouse emotion. The film takes an instant dip when she leaves the storyline. Russell Crowe...good ol' Russell Crowe. He is hit and miss for me. I actually really liked his character and performance in the film, the problem is (surprisingly so) his vocals didn't match that of Jackman's even remotely close and that made him seem lesser somehow. Its unfortunate. He still gives a truly outstanding performance and the chemistry between him and Jackman is perfect, if only his vocals were a little more up to par. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter play thieves and villains and the comedic relief of the film. They play their eccentric roles well because let's face it both of them are born to play this type of weird bizarre role. It isn't a huge stretch for either one of them but they do well in it. Isabelle Allen is the newfound star and plays young Cosette. She is just amazing and has a beautiful voice and certainly looks the part. Sadly she isn't the film very long but she makes an instant impression. The aforementioned casting faux pas that I think they made is in the latter half of the film. Amanda Seyfried has had some experience in musicals obviously and she has a nice voice but for me she didn't look the part of Cosette. In fact I found her enormous bulging eyes distracting and looked ridiculous. I just feel like someone with a more powerful voice would have done a much more impactful job. I think they would have done better with an unknown. I hate to say this about any young actor, especially for his first time in musicals but Eddie Redmayne destroys his character and not in a good way. The young man is awful in this movie. His mannerisms while singing are ridiculous and completely distracting. I am no singer but I am positive that you can do vibrato without looking like Ace Ventura. He looks and sounds hokey and it ruins every scene he is in. Samantha Barks is a beautiful girl with a lovely voice and she actually fits her role very well. She is a pleasure to see on screen but her performance is dragged down by the fact that many of her scenes are opposite Redmayne. Honorable mention must be given to Daniel Huttlestone and Aaron Tveit who have small roles but extremely well done and capture your hearts quickly.Tom Hooper deserves incredible praise for this brilliant piece of work. He got critical acclaim for The King's Speech but this just proves how talented he truly is. Obviously the key plays involved have so much passion and vision for bringing this story to the big screen. This wasn't rushed by any means and their labour of love shows in every single scene. The few lesser performances are completely out-shined by Jackman, Hathaway, Crowe and some supporting members so it matters very little. Fans of the musical will be absolutely floored seeing this on the big screen, no expense was spared. If you're not a fan of musicals this would be the one to win you over because its just so beautiful and heart wrenching to watch. Expect big things from this big screen musical because it is a feat of movie making. Bravo to everyone involved!! 9.5/10",9,5,9,30 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," As good as the first, I suppose it's just not my cup of tea
","The Marvel Universe on the whole has been great for me. I don't quite get the insane popularity of some of those films (AntMan for instance?) and I expected to really like the first Guardians film. I would never say the first film and this one were not 'good' because they have incredible special effect, good performances, good laughs and people love it. Good! But for me, for some reason, the film doesn't resonate with me. It has all the things I love about a good popcorn flick but it just ends up being okay with me and this one was the same as the first. I think it was easily as good as the first and expanded the Universe a little bit and the characters. I loved the Howard The Duck cameo, I LOVED my hero and idol Sylvester Stallone showing up, there were some good laughs....but I see reviewers and even friends saying they cried multiple times and how emotional it was....I didn't get any of them. It was a CGI studded event with Science Fiction roots all through it but it didn't break any grand moulds and no one will say it reshaped the Marvel Universe like Doctor Strange did. It was fun and that's about it. It is an easy watch and good music like the first but what about this movie makes it so unique from any other film in it's genre.Hollywood's latest superstar Chris Pratt might be part of the reason the film doesn't floor me. I like Pratt but I'm not sold on him as a superstar. He doesn't have the chemistry yet that (say Stallone had 20 years ago) or Dwayne Johnson nowadays. He plays this role well and this definitely builds more for his character and the Peter Quill story but he gives just a good performance in a good movie. Bradley Cooper as Rocket might be my favourite Guardian character but he is actually underused this time around. He has a few good lines and the banter between he and Pratt is good but I feel like he needs more story. Dave Bautista continues to surprise me as a half decent actor and he really nails the role of Drax. He is definitely the most lively character and also gets a ton of comedic moments and also some great action scenes. Zoe Saldana is decent but much like Rocket Raccoon, got downplayed significantly this time around. The romance between her and Quill is hinted at (which is part of the gag) but I think they should have added a touch more to it. I believe I said this in the first movie but why in the hell Vin Diesel was hired and is credited for being Groot makes no sense. I love Groot. He's adorable and funny but he is a 110% CGI character with an indiscernible voice so why do we need a Hollywood star playing him? Michael Rooker returns to get a huge character development as Yondu. It's a great twist to the story and he and Pratt are good together but I'm not sure the development makes a lot of sense given how quickly he makes a change. Still it definitely adds the emotional depth to the film. Karen Gillan is really amazing as Gamora's sister Nebula. She doesn't get enough screen time but her sub-plot was one of the best and I hope to see more of her in the future. And then we have Kurt Russell who is phenomenal in his role as Peter's long lost father. ***SPOILER ALERT*** he is also the villain, the big bad etc. and he is perfect at that. I'm so glad he's been getting a career boost as of late.James Gunn is probably the only person who can helm this franchise. He cares about it, he co-writes it, produces, directs and he wants to build the Guardians Universe and keep it cohesive and bravo to him for that. I am quite certain that the continuity and feel of this movie was as good as the first because of him. I think once he steps away from the helm of this franchise it won't be nearly as good especially for me who just thinks it's okay to begin with. I know he is crafting a story here and I will gladly see the third and not just because I see all Marvel films. This isn't one of my favourites but it's not because it isn't good. I am in a very very small minority who think Guardians of The Galaxy and Volume 2 were okay and average in every way. Check out the amazing visuals and stay for the characters and story and chances are you'll be as hooked as everyone else. Considering this an anomaly for me.",7,3,7,7 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Potentially interesting, but heavily flawed film
","I have not read The Da Vinci Code so this is a completely unbiased review on JUST the film, in fact I purposely avoiding reading the book so that I could see the film first. I am however half way through the prequel 'Angels and Demons' which does give me an idea of the main character Robert Langdon. I don't believe as many do that Tom Hanks was miscast. In fact I think that the Langdon character is not a strong character and Hanks embodied it just like he was written. Ron Howard should be commended for taking on this project. To call it controversial is the under statement of the year. The Book has caused enough controversy and the ENORMOUS success of the film certainly ups the ante. Is the film truly as controversial as all the people are crying out about?? Well yes it is. In fact much of the same content that makes the book so intriguing, interesting, and horrifying to Catholics and Christians is completely in tact in the film and some of the better scenes and parts are exploring those facts and clues.Tom Hanks takes the lead as Robert Langdon. A world famous Symbologist called in to take a look at a murder of the Louvre curator who appears to have pin pointed Langdon as his killer. Hanks' performance is surprisingly subtle. Hanks is one of the world's greatest actors, he can do almost anything and he can perform deep and gratifying characters but the character of Langdon is kind of vapid, and scared, and not a strong character. But Hanks does alright and he appears intelligent enough to look like a scientist of sorts. Audrey Tautou plays Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of the murder victim who dedicates herself to helping Langdon figure out her Grandfather's murder. Tautou is quite good and far more emotional than even Hanks' performance. They have decent chemistry although their growing romance never plays a part in the film which is okay. She was a good choice for the role and does a great job. Jean Reno who I very much respect as a decent character actor plays Police Inspector in charge of the investigation. His character has no depth at all, and is quite dull so unfortunately Reno comes across as such. He's not a bad guy, he's not a good guy, and although it would appear he has heavy involvement with the cover-up it never plays out that way. He's mostly useless. Paul Bettany is getting heavy flack for playing religious fighter and albino Silas. I think his performance is excellent. He's obviously insane but deeply determined to fight for his beliefs and his higher power. Bettany is the character with the most depth and he's captivating to watch and makes the best villain in the film if he's really a villain at all?? And finally one of the great performances is by Sir Ian Mckellen. He plays lifelong searcher of the Holy Grail, Leigh Teabing. One of the absolute highlights of the film is Teabing's rather lengthy monologue discussing all the clues and signs of the hidden Grail and the cover up, 'The Con of Man.' McKellen is captivating especially when he has a good script and a strong character and several of his scenes in Da Vinci are very powerful and he also has some rather campy scenes but his performance is still very good.There is no doubt that much of the film is confusing. There are so many sects fighting for different sides of the secret, it gets very confusing who is what and who wants what but then that is Dan Brown's style. You really have to watch closely or read closely and take it all in. The film has very nice scenery all shot on location in their actual spots...France, The Louvre, Germany...it definitely make it all feel very real. But the story does feel rushed at times which is amazing considering it's 2 1/2 hour time frame but the book is huge and there is a lot to process. On top that the acting and story at times feels campy and overdone and that's an odd move for this film which should be deadly serious. There isn't a lot of action which I expected more adventure maybe along the lines of Indiana Jones...I mean it is a fictional story at the heart. Langdon needed to be a stronger star and perhaps some more serious content...many even the book could have been a trilogy of sorts instead of cutting and editing the full book to a small movie by comparison.It is controversial, and it is worth seeing, and it has some very interesting points but overall the acting is sub par, the characters are flawed and the plot is chock full of holes. But if you just want to see something a little more intelligent than the average thriller you might enjoy it. It won't stick around for long. 7/10",7,0,2,26 May 2006
Rocky III," An important but yet sub standard edition to the series
","Rocky III is probably one of the most well known, liked, rooted for, and important entries in the series. Important because it was Rocky's first move into main stream film leaving behind it's more critically acclaimed roots. In a way Rocky III began to start the film's procession in the same direction as Balboa's career. In Rocky III Rocky has become enamored with the life of fame and fortune. He puts aside his training to show himself off to the people, and 'trades his passion for glory' as the famous theme song says. Rocky III featured not one but three fights and also featured big time wrestler Hulk Hogan and eighties icon Mr. T. as Rocky's adversaries. Now none of this is to say that Rocky III isn't good, I only mean to say that Rocky III falls from grace as far as the greatness of the original and it's sequel. However the third installment has some great moments that are integral to the series including the death of Rocky's mentor and trainer Mickey, in a very moving scene, and the friendship that grows between Rocky and former adversary Apollo Creed, who now trains Rocky. As a kid I always remembered Rocky III being my favorite but now seeing it years later it just doesn't have the depth and intelligence and intense story as some of the other ones.Sylvester Stallone once again helms the project as director, writer and star. I just felt that in this film Stallone lost his touch with Balboa and the character doesn't have the same feel but perhaps that is the idea? Either way Stallone is still watchable as the ultimate underdog because for the first time we see him as the champion dealing with his celebrity status and raising his son and being a husband and friend. He still manages to touch the heart strings for his powerful scene following Mickey's death. Burgess Meredith returns as Mickey in a very good performance. Mickey is obviously dying but Rocky is almost too busy with his fame to notice. His death is life shattering for Rocky and Meredith is a sad loss to the series but his scenes are powerful. Talia Shire returns as Rocky's wife Adrian. Her performance is toned down significantly in this film which is part of where the charm goes. Rocky has always been a powerful love story and Adrian's toned down part makes a big difference. Burt Young also returns as the incomparable Paulie who still gets that laughs with his rough around the edges performance is still the same old Paulie. He hardly ever changes and for the character and Young that's a good thing. Carl Weathers returns as Apollo Creed but this time as trainer rather than opponent desperate to help Rocky regain his title after Mr. T. destroys him. Weathers is even better as a friend to Rocky because he loses none of Creed's charm and flamboyance becoming trainer. Mr. T. is well...he's Mr. T....I mean the guy doesn't change much and his performance as Clubber Lang certainly did become a film classic. His steely look and brute force and build makes him a worthy opponent but even still I never thought he had the same talent as Balboa despite beating him once. Hulk Hogan makes a humorous appearance as 'Thunderlips' a pro-wrestler who agrees to take on Rocky for charity and gives a funny, and rather overblown performance.No matter what I say about Rocky III you must see it. It's an absolute eighties classic and it's an essential part of the Rocky series which everyone must see hands down. It has it's pluses and a few minuses being a little commercially forced but it also had some very important moments to the entire series. It just didn't quite have the heart as some of the other installments but for one of a series of 6 that is allowed and it still meets my approval. 7.5/10",7,2,2,9 January 2007
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The start to something much more phenomenal, a cinematic miracle
","Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone was the beginning of cinematic history. At the time of it's release it became the second highest grossing film of all time. It spawned a series of films that have absolutely only gotten better. It launched the career of it's three youngsters who seemed to have been absolutely built for these roles. It brought to the screen an epic fantasy adventure with kids in mind but without holding back a single thing like no other film had ever done. Philosopher's Stone is so important because it gives us the background and beginnings of the famous boy wizard. The film introduces us to characters and locations that fans of the book would be shown like never before. This film captured the book probably better than any other book to film transition in history.The three youngsters were brand new to Cinema and now will be forever locked to this series. Daniel Radcliffe plays Harry Potter. Harry Potter was already a literary masterpiece up there with Huck Finn or Tom Sawyer. But it's not only that he was able to get this part it's that he absolutely IS Harry Potter. Even in this first film before he really gets comfortable with the part his performance is perfect. He looks the part, sounds the part and acts the part. Harry's general submersion into the Wizard world having never known where he comes from is a huge moment and Radcliffe just draws you into that. He has big sparkling eyes and facial expressions that make you feel each emotion. Rupert Grint plays Harry's new best friend Ron Weasley. Grint has a big part on his young shoulders playing the nervous and unstoppably shy Ron. Although the big difference between this film and the future installments is Ron really takes matters into his hands and even sacrifices himself for Harry. He gets some huge bravery points and really comes out of his shell. But Grint still plays the jittery youngster very well. Out of the three of them the one I have the most hope for doing other things in the future is lovely young Emma Watson who plays the absolutely insatiable Hermione Granger. Hermione is loud, outspoken, strong, a powerful wizard, but also deeply sensitive underneath it all. She has this powerful bond to both Harry and Ron and they form an unstoppable friendship. Watson just has this sparkle and bite to her that I think will make her a fantastic actress and makes her absolutely perfect for Hermione Granger. The three of them have terrific chemistry and this film shows their first meeting and the bond of their friendship already. Lastly the thing that makes the Harry Potter films including this one so outstanding is the unbelievable supporting cast which features some of the greatest, veteran actors of their kind. And they aren't used sparingly and they don't downplay their small roles but rather give stand out, brilliant performances. One of my favorite characters is Rubeus Hagrid played by Robbie Coltrane. I felt like he was played almost a little too foolish in this first installment but he is still a loving giant that cares a lot for the kids at Hogwart's and also manages to take in some peculiar pets as well. The late, amazing Richard Harris plays master wizard, head master of the school and Harry's ultimate mentor Albus Dumbledore. Harris created the image and voice and personality of on-screen Dumbledore and he did a terrific job. He's mysterious and important and has an aura about him. Maggie Smith plays Professor Minerva McGonagall, the ever watching Professor who always catches the kids in situations they shouldn't be in. She's terrific and I would love to see her get a slightly larger role in the future. Second only to Hagrid one of my favorite characters is played by Alan Rickman, Professor Severus Snape. He's probably the most evil looking good guy in any film. He is to the bone a good guy and yet has this bad guy look about him. In this film he is implied of course as the bad guy but turns out to be a hero amongst the teachers. And finally Ian Hart plays Voldemort's Hench man and teacher of the dark arts defense Professor Quirinus Quirrell. His role is basically quite small until the last half hour of the film but in that last half hour he really does a terrific job as the bad guy and Harry's adversary.The brilliance of how this cast fits together and fits their roles is completely unexplainable. You have to see it and future films to understand the true meaning of how incredible this film series comes together and this is the one that started it all. The dark overtone of the film, Harry's sad story and his quest to belong and touch base with his parents whom he lost before he could even remember is seemingly too dark for children, or so other film makers would have you believe. Certainly director Chris Columbus is no stranger to kid's films or even films about overcoming adversity, he's a great director that makes you feel his films. He does probably lighten the whole Harry Potter mood certainly more than the directors who took over the last two installments. The special effects in Harry Potter are stunning especially watching the Quidditch game which really is a high point of the film. I find that the film is really blatantly heavy with CGI hence why perhaps I didn't tack on a perfect score like I did for the final two films. They seem to use the CGI special effects much better later on. Fluffy, the three headed monster dog, as cool of a character as he was looked nearly completely animated. Still Children won't notice it and it's absolutely breath taking for them and for adults the story and the adventure is equally as strong and a must see. 9/10",9,0,1,1 July 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Just incredible...taking this series to new heights
","Whether my opinion or not the Harry Potter franchise will certainly go down as one of the greatest series of films in history. I do believe that the series rivals Star Wars, or any other great film franchise in history. That being said I wasn't an enormous fan of the first two films which I haven't seen in some time but I remember not being overtly impressed. I can say that the films offer absolute breathtaking visuals and special effects unprecedented in a 'kid's film.' No one has ever ventured to make such a gutsy, mature fantasy adventure film series aimed at kids and teens and they score every time. Nonetheless I ventured to see the newest installment and was absolutely blown away!! Granted I did see it on the IMAX theater but I don't think that had much to do with it. The story was so much more mature, aimed at an entirely different and diverse demographic. The story was much more simplistic, easy to follow, the characters were fun and intense, and the entire film was breathtakingly perfect!! By now Daniel Radcliffe should have the role of Harry Potter down to a finesse so that no other person could EVER be Harry Potter and I think he does that perfectly. He's the hesitant hero, the boy wonder that is humble, honest, torn apart by a mysterious past, soft spoken and a little awkward. He is the perfect adolescent hero. He seemed to really come into character into this one and performs the role flawlessly. I'm not sure as an actor he could do much else but for this role...it was made for him. Emma Watson also returns as the rather intense Hermione Granger. She is really the opposite sex of Harry Potter but the same idea. She is for the girls to follow. She's a little awkward, she's starting to grow up, date, learn new things...she's also quite good in her role although I think she has talent left untapped beyond Harry Potter. As long as the film makers steer clear of sexualizing her just because she's getting older than it'll be fine. Rupert Grint returns as the shy, and clumsy Ron Weasley. Together the three of them make a good team and good friends and each have a different side of adolescence set out which is good. They all have very distinctive characters and they all do a great job in their roles. They really have them down pat after four films. Most of the Hogwart's teaching staff all return as well Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and David Bradley. To really get into any depth about their characters or performances is kind of pointless. They are all great actors, most of them having been around for many years and they all fit into their roles in each installment and in this one as well perfectly. They are great!! What truly sets Goblet of Fire apart from the others is the story. It's brilliant, non stop action and we finally lay eyes on a physical form of the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry's nemesis played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes. New director Mike Newell I must give the most credit too, taking the helm from Chris Columbus, and Alfonso Cuarón. Newell's approach is completely different and the film is far more mature and intense and takes the story so much further than ever before. I would even hesitate to bring young children to the film because it is that dark. But it does make it far more interesting for older children, teens and adults...widens the demographic right out and makes me edge of my seat for the next installment. The special effects are absolutely brilliant, they aren't shoddy CGI but rather brilliantly created from Hogwarts to each magic step of the Wizard's contest. I can honestly say that sometimes the acting was a little bit campy, some reactions and overly emotional moments. And the ending was a little bit cut and dry for the film that it was. Nothing was really wrapped up in the end...it would have been better to have left it hanging for the next installment but that's not the Harry Potter way and it's still the best of the series and an absolutely amazing adventure!! 10/10",10,0,0,24 February 2006
In Time," Genius concept falls into the gaping plot holes
","I think In Time would have made a genius TV Series where they could have spent a lot of time making sure details were covered. Instead In Time takes an absolutely brilliant premise, a potentially strong social message, and delivers it to the specific teen genre and loses itself into some major plot holes. You could spend hours trolling the boards on IMDb to discover just how many plot holes the film has. A sci-fi movie/action movie is bound to have significant plot holes. It has to make you suspend belief and not even notice it but the problem with In Time is you do notice the plot holes. You will stop numerous times and think to yourself...wait that doesn't work...and why would that be the case. Fortunately for the movie the premise is just really cool and the world they create is significant enough that the film is redeemable and watchable. It disappoints me perhaps even more that the idea is so good but the delivery is flawed.I adore Justin Timberlake. I think he has a BIG career ahead of him in film. He seems to absolutely shine in comedy (SNL, Friends With Benefits and even the deplorable Love Guru.) As an action star he is decent, his character is good, the film is sort of a futuristic Robin Hood story. He has solid chemistry on screen and carries the film well but sadly it won't be his break out role I think. Amanda Seyfried is bizarre in this movie. That's the only way I can describe her. She has a sexy vibe in the movie but her character is almost purposely robotic. She has this strange look about her and her behavior is robotic but its almost as though she is supposed to be that way. Cillian Murphy is a terrific villain and he is good in this movie but he isn't great. His villainous character almost feels like its held back in some way and he doesn't get to open up enough. He's a strong actor but the script seems to hold him back. Seyfriend and Timberlake's chemistry is okay but isn't as hot as they try to make it out to be. The lack of really strong chemistry between the lead cast holds back the film as well.Writer and director Andrew Niccol has come up with a phenomenal take on sci-fi that also tells a very real version of the way the world is becoming. Unfortunately I think the studios expected him to dumb this down to get it into the minds of pre-teens and teens instead of making it a smart, savvy, thriller. All that complaining aside it isn't a bad movie. It has moments of being really entertaining, thrilling, some great car chases, and shoot outs and some unique style to it. It isn't beyond redemption, it simply doesn't live up to the original concept. 7.5/10",7,1,2,3 February 2012
Thor," God of Thunder? Meh...whatever...
","I've talked to a lot of people that saw Thor and many of them had the same thing to say. It was just okay...it was meh...it left no solid impression on your like other Marvel superheroes that became larger than life on the screen like Spiderman or X-Men. Thor had some stumbling blocks. I think first of all he's a tough hero to translate to the big screen. For that purpose they did okay. The scenery and special effects are truly outstanding. The scenes that are on Asgard and the frost giants world are stunning and something else to see. Although as always the 3D did nothing for me. It looked just as good in 2D. The issue is not the effects. The issue is the characters don't really go well together, and Thor, the God of Thunder spends nearly the entire film on earth and powerless. It isn't until the last half hour or less of the movie when he finally regains his powers and starts to kick butt. Up until then you're just watching an awkward enormous blonde man live amongst humans. The romance that blossoms in the film is forced and downright silly and the action scenes are done almost without Thor for a lot of the time.There is no doubt that Chris Hemsworth fits the build and look of Thor. In fact he isn't bad in the role. I felt like it was a little campy (nothing compared to the 1970's role of Thor on The Incredible Hulk TV Series) but he still doesn't come to life in front of you. Natalie Portman who is a huge superstar in Hollywood is almost wasted in this movie. She is supposed to be a brilliant scientist but looks like a deer in the headlights, picks up this over-sized brute of a man and then somehow falls in love with him in a few seconds. Portman looks pretty as always but that's about as far as it goes. The chemistry between them is weak. Tom Hiddleston is Loki, Thor's adopted brother and if you know even a little about the Thor storyline you know where his story is going. Hiddleston is good. He makes an interesting anti-hero/villain and while he's a little campy it will be interesting to see where he takes the character. The legendary Anthony Hopkins joins the cast which automatically brings up the ante of this cast but even Hopkins' character as Thor's father is a little empty to me. He is good but he isn't great and that's what you want from a big budget summer flick and Hopkins. Stellan Skarsgård and Kat Dennings have supporting roles as Portman's co-workers and they are good but they don't get a chance to really stand out. Kat Dennings is the comic relief but her comedy is misplaced at times. Honorable mention to Colm Feore who plays King of the Frost Giants. He has a small but decent role.Thor was supposed to be of course another lead in to The Avengers film which I still think is a risky prospect but Marvel are trying their best. This was certainly the summer of Marvel but I think Thor was the weakest of their entries considering how amazing X-Men First Class was and Captain America was solid too. Thor almost felt like just a filler film that they had to do. Director Kenneth Branagh is a great director and an even better actor but I think he didn't have a lot to work with. They forced it out and didn't try to reach the quality that they often do with new properties like Iron Man. But for fans of Marvel flicks I suppose it will get watched and it is mildly entertaining but it won't stick with you long after the credits role. 7/10",Null,1,3,23 August 2011
The Happening," I just can't give it a grade...there must be something we're all missing...is this the twist??
","I won't do it. When you get to the end of this review there will not be a grade out of ten because I just can't do it. I want to slap a poor score on it and then the next minute I'm crying out to M. Night Shyamalan (who never answers back) that there has to be a secret to this film as to why it was PURPOSELY made so poorly. The man is not new to film making and I have loved every single one of his movies and the thing is they have all been downright brilliant. Brilliantly written, perfectly cast, wonderfully acted and beautifully directed. I will also say to all those people out there who crap of Lady In The Water...I adored Lady In The Water, pure and utter brilliance and beauty and probably my favorite of his films. The Village I could live without, it wasn't quite as intelligent as his other entries and then there is this which doesn't even register on the scale of intelligence. It's ludicrous!! There is virtually no story, not one that makes sense, the acting is horrid on the part of every single actor especially the lead cast. There is no beginning and end really, no twist, no cares, you just never wanna see it again. I'll get to my rant in a moment.I'm going by face value and although I used to not be able to stand Mark Wahlberg but lately he had grown on me with some impressive performances. In this film he is absolutely putrid. One of the worst performances I have ever seen and I am telling you that 100% he is doing it on purpose. He is purposely acting bad. First of all his character acts like a child...and this is done on purpose I am sure of it I just don't know why. Other reviewers have noticed this as well. His scared puppy dog look about being left behind on the train, and his tone and his facial expressions...he's acting like a 10 year old boy but WHY?!?! Almost as bad is the performance by Zooey Deschanel. She acts like a child as well and that can't be just a coincidence?!?! She has these enormous eyes that are constantly zoomed in on as she just plain acts BAD!! The two of them together make a deplorable twosome with some sort of back story about them and their wedding that we are never privy too. John Leguizamo CAN act. I've seen it...and this is not it. He's acting almost as poorly as Wahlberg and has that child like quality about him too. There is some bad blood between his character and Deschanel's character but we don't know why and don't care really. The supporting cast aren't really terrible, they just aren't in it much and we don't care because the lead cast is so awful. Is M. Night Shyamalan trying to create a movie that is so bad it will become a cult classic twenty years from now? Is that his twist? Will he pop out twenty years from now when the Golden edition Red Ray disk version is released and say HA I PLANNED YOU ALL TO LIKE IT IN TWENTY YEARS!! Is there some hidden mystery to the lead cast acting like children? Is it some message about purity and environmental ruin? There has to be something...someone please save the reputation of M. Night Shyamalan for me because this film single handedly ruined him as one of my favorite directors and yet I hold hope that there is something more, something fiendishly clever about the movie. I kept wondering if the twist would be that all these people were filming a bad B Movie like Godzilla or Valley of The Dolls or something but no it appears that it just might be that bad. But to hold out hope I will not rate this movie for the first time in 700 reviews!! I only encourage film buffs to watch this and try to find for yourself the reason why it is terrible but do not go see this expecting to be entertained because it is ridiculous!! A summer bomb by any stretch of imagination!!",Null,2,6,3 July 2008
The Fountain," A rare and odd cult classic that brings out some hard core fanatics
","When I read that some people considered Darren Aronofsky's The Fountain as one of their most anticipated titles ever I laughed...even mocked them because I had no idea that The Fountain had such an intense following or fans. I also had my doubts as to whether or not The Fountain would really impress me. Most of the write ups, descriptions and trailers really don't explain what the film is about at all. The most common description I read was something to the effect of a man traveling through time to try and save the woman he loves but that isn't what The Fountain is at all. The Fountain at it's heart is this moving love story about a medical researcher who has found in his heart and soul in his wife Izzie. Where The Fountain gets it's odd if not beautiful twist is the fantasy aspect based on the book being written by his wife. Following her death he is left with the quest of finishing her book and launches a dream like sequence that is unusual and mind bending and opens up a world of interpretation and discussion for this film.Hugh Jackman turns in an absolutely stunning performance as 'Tommy.' Jackman's performance is so incredibly emotional and moving and the entire film rests on his persistent state of desire and love and the drive to find the cure for his wife. I think Jackman's performance is in fact award worthy and moving!! Rachel Weisz plays Jackman's wife Isabel Creo. The immediate and established charisma between Jackman and Weisz is astonishing. Aronofsky doesn't bother to try and show a back story between the two, or establish this incredible romance but rather does it so easily and you just feel the emotion between them. Weisz is also very, very good and emotional and looks lovely in the role. The two of them single handedly carry this film and do it flawlessly. You could watch them act off of each other four hours because they are that brilliant although Jackman ultimately outshines. The supporting cast does include some great actors including Ellen Burstyn, Mark Margolis, and Sean Patrick Thomas.The Fountain is such a deeply intelligent film and as mentioned earlier it's the type of film that can be dissected and discussed and debated and is so complex and obscure but never takes away from the heart of the film which is this intense romance. The Fountain is really something to be experienced and I wish I had paid more attention to it when it was released in 2006. Anyone wanting something a little different, complex and deeply intelligent will find The Fountain just about perfect. 9/10",9,2,4,3 June 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," Tip toeing around a classic...
","I hate writing reviews for films such as this. But I must do it, as a movie goer and fan. Whether I love it or hate, people can be very touchy when you try to critique an absolute classic. Capra's It's A Wonderful Life is definitely that.The timeless Christmas story about a man named George Bailey who has always been handed the short end of the stick but has persevered through it and never complained. He lost his hearing in one ear, had his college dreams halted, travel plans stopped, all to help out other people. He's a good decent man but never has he been rewarded for his decency. Finally his good cheer and helping others catches up to him and in one swoop it appears his father's business, all it's clients, his family, everything is on the line and he could go to jail for losing money. It seems this time George feels he would be helping everyone by ending his life and contemplates suicide on the worst night of his life. Fortunately for George an angel-in-training Clarence must help George realize how fortunate he is in order to get his wings. Clarence grants George's wish that he had never been born and he gets a look at what life would have been like without George Bailey. By the time George realizes all he has effected in his life, he also realizes the only thing important is love, and family, and friends.This amazing Epic as I will call it clocks in at an impressive 2 1/2 hours and doesn't apologize for it and doesn't need to. Nothing is left to the imagination as we watch the entire life of George Bailey, from beginning to his current situation. We see the major events that shaped him into a man, falling in love, his children, his job, his dreams, his aspirations. We become so incredibly attached to Bailey that we are right there with him. Capra creates a character that is unforgettable and then builds this amazing little world of Bedford falls around Bailey. The characters within George's life are no less realistic to the viewer. We feel like we know everyone, know the little town and we are right there. Jimmy Stewart, one of the all time greats is probably the best person to suck us in and make us love him even without Bailey's amazing character. Capra managed to bring on board some amazing actors for the time and it brings the film to life. I waited until I was 22 to see this movie because I was determined to watch it at Christmas to fully appreciate it and I did. It has blown me away ever since. It's heart felt realism, it's sadness, it's Christmas spirit, it's tone, it's characters. Everything is amazing. This is without a doubt, a true Hollywood Classic.I can't find a single bad word to say about this movie. Some might find it boring but everything that is in the film is so vital to the story that it must be left in. The dark edge to the film which is necessary in order to truly scare George back to his senses gives the film a little twist to stand the test of time. I never see this film as an 'oldie' because it could happen any time, any where. Go watch it right now!! 10/10",10,1,5,26 December 2004
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Torn opinions
","Having thought this would be a typical loads of fun, big action summer film I looked forward to seeing it. I am a Brad Pitt fan and Angelina Jolie is okay in most things so I thought it would be very cool. The plot seems like action perfection and any time two big Hollywood stars are put up against each other it's usually good times ie: The Jackal, Assassins etc. I wasn't wrong about the action...the action sequences are intense and well done and not overly wrought with stupid special effects, unfortunately the rest of the film drags it down.Mr and Mrs Smith is the story of a bored couple who have been married 'five or six years.' They met in Columbia and it was instant attraction and they married quickly but then find themselves in Marriage counseling because they aren't connecting and becoming very bored. Their boredom stems from the fact that neither one of them knows the other at all. Mr John Smith, is supposedly a big time construction contractor and Mrs Jane Smith works with computers on Wall Street or so each of them believe of the other. In fact they both work for opposing factions as Assassins, and they are each the best in their line. Everything is kept well hidden from the other until they are both given the same target by their respective companies. They don't recognize each other as they both fight to off the target and it isn't until afterwords they discover each other's identity. Now it's a problem...each of their companies wants them to knock the other off having identified each other at the target. Feeling betrayed and feeling that their marriage is a sham their anger transfers into the desire to kill each other in the 48 hour time frame. But as they fight back and forth they slowly begin to learn more about each other than they ever knew before and they fall in love all over again. Now both their companies want them dead feeling they are a threat to their security and they must work together to escape their deaths.I will agree with the popular opinion that Brad and Angelina have no on screen chemistry. Separately they do an adequate job and some of their fight scenes are very cool but their chemistry never changes from ZERO!! Perhaps it's all the outside stuff working it's way in. The first 45 minutes of the film is downright boring and the audience is twice as bored as they are in their marriage...at least I was. Director Doug Liman seems to aim more for story and drama than outright action which for a film like this doesn't always please. He works too hard at establishing their boring lives and their alter egos and then all the comparisons and funny little anecdotes that go along with being a boring normal housewife/husband but actually a hit-man(woman). Basically the film tries to take suburbia and drop assassins into it but it doesn't mesh. Nonetheless the action scenes are wicked cool and Jolie and Pitt trying to kill each other in their home was very awesome. The only downside to the action was how incredibly invincible both Jolie and Pitt's characters are. They take a deadly beating first from each other and then other assassins and still manage to come out completely unscathed. I know this is the kind of thing that has to be accepted for big action films sometimes but it really stands out in this one. Vince Vaughn's role (although granted he had some funny lines) was completely unnecessary and took away from the story. It seems that most people think this movie is just awesome so I won't argue with them, I will only say I was more than slightly disappointed with what I thought it would be compared to what it was. Personally save it for a DVD rental...then it won't be too bad, but save your cash for the theater and see something else. 6/10",6,0,1,12 July 2005
The Departed," Scorcese creates a whole new classic
","The Departed will hands down become an instant classic further positioning director Martin Scorcese in the cinema hall of fame. This is Scorcese's biggest public hit now grossing over 100 million dollars. The cast is brilliant, an ensemble the likes we have yet to see this year. The story is gritty, violent and captivating. Despite a bit of a dragging tempo it only leaves you open to be more blind sided by the shocking twists when they do happen. The climax and the end of the film will literally move you to the edge of your seat as it all boils over. It's a thriller, crime drama, mob story and delivers everything it promises and best of all it seems to be simultaneously a critical and viewer smash success and I predict certain Oscar wins as locked in the bag perhaps even a nomination for long overdue Leonardo DiCaprio. I won't say it's one of my favorite films of the year, in fact I toyed between 8 and 9 but the film has to be given respect and points for it's cast, gritty direction and style while I still sit on top of the opinion that it flows a little slowly and almost predictable at times.Leonardo DiCaprio sincerely knocks one out of the park as young, if not slightly naive rookie cop Billy Costigan. Despite this huge incredible ensemble cast DiCaprio stands out as really doing an amazing job. Forced undercover in this brutal Boston mob war he struggles on the line between good and evil but holds his moral ground when all is said and done. If DiCaprio doesn't get an Oscar Nod for this portrayal there is something wrong!! Matt Damon plays DiCaprio's counterpart in more ways than one playing slick and dirty cop Colin Sullivan. Whereas DiCaprio is undercover on the mob side, Damon is undercover in the police precinct for the mob. Damon's character is almost the mirror image opposite of everything DiCaprio's character is as they play this cat and mouse game with each other without ever really coming into contact until the final scenes. It's brilliant and wonderfully played out. I found Damon a little much, almost over acting, but still his character was a sleazy bad guy that you definitely detest. And then there is Jack. Honestly...what can you say about Jack Nicholson. The guy is an icon, he's a master, a genius and rumor has it that Scorcese even gave Jack full authority over his lines in the film telling him to go with it...I mean he's Jack!! He plays the head of this crime family Frank Costello and although he is portrayed as the incarnation of evil he doesn't really come across as overtly brutal but a leader nonetheless. He ups the ante to this story by leaps and bounds and DiCaprio and him are brilliant together. Mark Wahlberg plays a smaller supporting role as Detective Dignam, in charge of DiCaprio's undercover work. His role is a brutal, mouthy, loud man who just really wants to get the job done and make sure the undercover work is not being screwed. All in all Wahlberg gets everything he wants but his role is unfortunately small. I think he has really done some terrific work as of lately and this is a great performance by him. And finally the terrific Martin Sheen in an unfortunately small supporting role as Oliver Queenan, the aging detective who convinces DiCaprio to go undercover. Sheen is terrific on screen and could easily hold a leading role even in his aging days but he gets a supporting role that is decent.If nothing else The Departed has plenty of surprises in store for you. It's not like it has a twist to it...the story is almost predictable but nonetheless you will find yourself shocked by some of the outcomes the scenes involved. Just when you think you're in for a heavy handed drama the guns come out blazing so to speak. If nothing else this could the crime drama of the year considering the slightly disappointing Black Dahlia and Hollywoodland. The Departed is a throwback to the great films of the eighties with hundreds of foul words used, brutally bloody violence, and an almost film noire feel to it. Scorcese has this picture locked up because fans of his say this might be his greatest to date and I say it's absolutely worth seeing for the cast and for the story alone!!! 8.5/10",8,0,1,3 November 2006
Die Hard," Was there Action Films before Die Hard?? Who cares!! Die Hard is the patriarch of modern action.
","Of course the Action Genre existed before Die Hard. After all you had The Terminator, Commando, Top Gun, Roadhouse...but didn't Die Hard absolutely revolutionize the eighties action Genre. It came like a savior and encompassed everything that would blow you right out the back of the theater and made Bruce Willis an absolute idol in the Action world and for good reason. Die Hard had pointless nudity, scores of bad language, bloody death, guns, explosions, a gritty, tough as nails, sweating, dirty hero that takes on everyone with nothing more than a hand gun and his brains. If you watch Willis in Die Hard it's a thing of beauty. His shirt torn off, bare foot, wounds all over him...he looks like he just crawled from a war rather than stalking terrorists through an enormous high rise office building in L.A. The script was so dead on...it was basic, it was to the point, it has great sarcastic humor and one liners that could never be forgotten. And Willis was the man to pull it all together. Add a decent supporting cast, a guy on the ground who is like his partner and a MacGyver style of killing bad guys that will go down in history...THIS IS DIE HARD.Bruce Willis was brought up right in the Prime of his TV Series Moonlighting where his irresistible charm and personality made him a hit. John McLean was David Addison but with a lot more guts and a lot more ammo. That only made the film more exciting to fans of Willis already. Willis has a way of just making everything edge of your seat and everything believable. Who else could make you smile in fear when he's diving out of a 30 story window attached to a fire hose while the roof of the building is exploding. He really doesn't single handedly make the film...the supporting cast is terrific. Bonnie Bedelia is great as McLean's straight laced, professional and estranged wife. They make an odd yet touching couple. They have some electricity and it's ironic and yet sensible that they don't end up together throughout the series. Still Bedelia is a great female lead and her character is strong and not at all misused in the role. Alan Rickman is just one kick ass bad guy. Can you say anything else?? As terrorist Hans Gruber he is terrifying, evil, brilliant, and you just despise him and you can't wait to see him go up against Willis and he does. He doesn't stand a chance but Rickman is still brilliant as the bad guy. Reginald VelJohnson plays a small yet very important role as Willis' guy on the ground on the other end of a walkie talkie. They don't know each other, and barely know each other's name but yet they become as close as partners and they too are odd together and yet fit. William Atherton has to be mentioned even though it's a very small role, it's Die Hard history that he plays slimy, tabloid reporter Richard Thornburg who gets his just end by Holly McLean's fist which becomes a running joke in the series.Die Hard is everything that people would look at in disgust now in the new millennium and yet it was everything the eighties stood for when it came to action and heroes. McLean has a cigarette dangling from his mouth, blood pouring everywhere, and a happy ending despite all the destruction around them. If you haven't seen Die Hard you can't ever proclaim yourself an action fan because Die Hard IS action. It's the film every action film strives to live to and will never meet...whether it was before 1988 or after. We won't ever get something like this again. It's an absolute 100% classic!! for all the wrong reasons!! 10/10",10,24,30,7 February 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A sequel was a must but it was just a step too far
","This was probably my most anticipated film of the summer season so expectations were definitely high. The first film was mind blowing action and launch the opportunity for an incredible series of films. I think in part legendary action director and producer Michael Bay has a very specific recipe for action that seems to always work so in his mind the ultimate sequel would simply be more of everything that made the first installment incredible and that doesn't necessarily make for the perfect follow up. Plus I think the first Transformers was so stunning because for the first time ever you were seeing the legendary toy/cartoon characters in larger than life reality but now the novelty of that has worn off. Transformers 2 is still great, loads of fun, some incredible battles, familiar characters and a welcome sequel but indeed does not surpass or really even touch the original film. The biggest probably with the film, and I've heard this voiced by other critics, is that there are just SO MANY robots. Most of the time you have no idea who is who rather than keeping to the core group. The only Transformer I could pinpoint at any one time was Optimus Prime, even Megatron blended with some of the others.Hollywood It guy Shia LaBeouf returns to his heroic role as Sam Witwicky. I had thought that maybe the movie creators would give LaBeouf a little more character than the first time around but they basically keep him at the same level as the first one. Still he fits the film very well and he is as good as he was in the original and that is okay for the role. Megan Fox returns again and her role is even less than it was in the first film. I have no doubt that Fox's purpose in this film was to drive red blooded males crazy and she does that with ease but her character is mostly quite vapid. The decent chemistry between her and LaBeouf is barely there any more and she has to share her sexy status with another female this time around. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also return in a slightly larger role. Both of them are great and I wish they had more screen time as the heroes of the film. John Turturro turned in a very quirky love/hate character in the first film but his return in this installment felt forced and was part of the unnecessary over done comedy that plagued this installment. Isabel Lucas gives Fox a run for her money both for Witwicky's affections and sex symbol for the film. Lucas gets a great bad-ass role and is a killer to the bone making for a great foe to the team.Michael Bay's success comes from the over the top action that leaves you on the edge of your seat, explosions, battles, and the perfect mix of serious adrenaline and witty sharp sarcastic comedy. Unfortunately the overwhelming slapstick comedy is kind of overbearing in Revenge of the Fallen. Sam's parents who return from the first one are cute and funny but they are way overused unlike the first film. The mother played by Julie White is bordering on obnoxious and then they actually make her get drunk...ugh. One of the most stunning things to see in this film is the creation of the incredible Devastator. Unfortunately he goes down pretty quick but it is something to see. Also the addition of a higher up to Megatron could have been left out. In the first film Megatron was like a Transformer god and after being resurrected again in this film it almost feels like he is barely a threat as Optimus Prime rips through him like nothing. With a film like this there will ALWAYS be complaints and I am not trying to downplay it because it absolutely is worth seeing and there are some really terrific scenes but it overloads the things that made this film series incredible. Hopefully for the third part they will make a few changes to make the end of this trilogy truly mind blowing. 8.5/10",8,18,31,23 August 2009
Jersey Boys," For having no expectations...a colossal all around disappointment
","I have never seen the stage play of Jersey Boys though I have always wanted to. I still would like to because I know how different the film version of stage plays can be. It seems to be that the producers and directors of unsuccessful stage to movie adaptations seem to forget that that stage plays are so successful for a reason and completely butchering them will make people not like the movie. I don't know if that's the case with Jersey Boys but the film was dreadfully slow, the music was not well used AT ALL, the performances were okay at best but I felt like they really lacked power behind them. Despite the singing supposedly being done live on set, several of the performances looked horribly dubbed. I could swear that audio was off their lip movement and that just breaks the entire feel of the film. The film makers do nothing to capture the 'gritty' streets of New Jersey and you just don't really get that epic feeling of following an absolute icon of Rock and Roll through various decades. I simply felt as though there was more to be told that I wasn't seeing. I would have rather they focused more on Frankie Valli, although I understand the film is about the four of them. The performances weren't terrible, but rather felt underdeveloped and missing something. Maybe the translation to big screen doesn't work for this story.Now if I understand correctly, this cast comes heavily from the Broadway adaptation of Jersey Boys. That, to me, is a smart movie under normal circumstances. Still I felt like this cast was struggling to find their place and never quite comfortable on screen in their roles. John Lloyd Young plays Frankie Valli and certainly has the right look and the right voice (if that was his real voice) but I didn't feel like the script gave him enough to really shine. Yes, we understood him as a person but I felt like I wanted more and instead he gives a so-so performance. Vincent Piazza was probably the best in this cast as Tommy DeVito and certainly gets the best story arc and the best scenes because his character is so confrontational and abrasive (in a good way.) The relationship between him and Frankie certainly drives the story and is one of the few reasons this gets even a five from me. Erich Bergen was wasted in the movie and I found his performance stiff and irritating. He was supposed to be this passionate song writer but he seemed so wooden and his emotions were not strong enough to carry the film. He was very disappointing. Even his line delivery felt like he was nervous or something similar. Michael Lomenda had one really good scene and it was a very ironic one. Finally, near the end of the film, tired of feeling back seat to Frankie and Tommy...he erupts into a tirade. This was very true to form because for most of the film I forgot Lomenda existed in his role. He was completely underdeveloped and if it wasn't a film about the 'Four Seasons' I would say he was unnecessary and barely a supporting character. Christopher Walken was decent in his small role and certainly added some class and experience to the cast. This was the only role though that I can remember Walken doing where he looked bored and very laid back. Maybe that was just the character. I certainly would never say anything bad about Walken.I use to be the world's biggest Clint Eastwood fan. I ate up everything I did and I still reluctantly say the man is a brilliant actor in his day and director in his day. Then he embarrassed all his fans during his ridiculous 'Political Chair' rant and even before then his career choices have slipped significantly. Invictus was okay, Hereafter was awful, J. Edgar was full of potential and fell completely flat and now Jersey Boys. Its like he's lost his vision creatively. Or his ego gets in the way and he tries to make a story based on truth or other works and completely changes it and it ruins the story. Jersey Boys lacked passion, lacked direction, lacked heavy talent...it just felt like it was missing so many pieces to the puzzle. I would absolutely love to see the stage play to see if I'm correct in assuming they changed the premise enough to ruin why it is so successful on stage. Rock of Ages did the same thing last year by butchering what is an amazing stage play (the best thing I have ever seen) into a so-so movie because some egotistical director thought they could do better. The ending of the film where they aged the actors to play elderly versions of themselves looked ridiculous. The actors looked like high school kids pretending to be old men. This was a huge pass for me and its unfortunate because I absolutely adore stage plays, classic music and life stories like this one. The Jersey Boys film hits all the wrong notes. 5/10",5,8,19,1 July 2014
The Holiday," Brilliantly funny, touching, all around beautifully made and fun to watch film
","Nancy Meyers has quickly gained my respect as a formidable director that really knows how to pull the heart strings and tap into the viewers emotions. She is brilliant. She has produced, written and directed some of the greatest sweet dramas of the last two decades. The Holiday is no exception to this rule. I waited a long to see it and after my girlfriend absolutely raved about it I sat down to watch it and was absolutely blown away. The Holiday is sweet, touching, funny, watchable, a great story with a small but effective cast. The Holiday and many other Meyers' films have been considered 'chick flicks' but even still The Holiday pleases on many levels with laugh out loud comedy, adorable romance, and dramatic flare that could bring tears to your eyes.Cameron Diaz is Amanda, a high profile strong, and very successful woman who has nothing but problems with the men in her life. I am not a huge Diaz fan although she can be very versatile and has had some good roles but in this film she nails it and is very watchable. Her story line is far more comedic than the rest of the film including the odd and yet perfectly made voice over-film trailer style narration to major turning points in her life (Amanda is a film trailer editor adding the irony to it.) They don't over use Diaz and make her the focus of attention simply because she is the biggest name in the film amidst some very talented actors. Kate Winslet is Iris, a woman who is also finding her life unbearable and desperately needs and wants a change from her simple country life where the man she had an affair with and fell in love with is now marrying the woman he left her for. Winslet is the perfect opposite to Diaz's character and they balance the film between each other's stories. While both suffering from guy problems, they are so different and have different life styles. They are both fun to watch and a commanding screen presence, and they are both brilliant in their respective roles. Enter Jude Law as Graham, Winslet's brother who bumps into Diaz after she switches homes and life with Winslet. Law is another actor I am not a big fan of. I think his ego is far bigger than his talent but that being said he does well in this compassionate, good guy role although at times his ego still is too inflated and I think someone less known might have done better. Still Law and Diaz have good chemistry and make a good couple. Jack Black in a total different turn plays Miles, a successful musician who has fallen in love with a beautiful actress and has his heart broken but has found a new friend in Winslet and their love blossoms together. Black still manages to be funny without being over the top and fits into the drama just fine. This might be his first real turn at proving he is versatile and can do other things. The four of them make two very different stories and very different romances...polar opposite stories that could stand on their own as it is. You're getting two romances for the price of one. Winslet and Black have this slowly growing friendship that turns to love and Law and Diaz have this whirlwind one night stand that turns into something more seemingly by destiny.Although The Holiday was written and released as a Christmas film you really can watch it any time with anyone, it's that good at what it does. It can go from deep drama to slapstick comedy to dry humor in a single bound and you love every second of it. From England, to L.A. and from heart break to romance...it is quite simply brilliant. Anyone who loves a good romance must see this film because it is wonderfully written, beautifully directed and brilliantly performed and still has a very different feel to it. Also look for a very brief yet very funny cameo by Mr. Dustin Hoffman, and a hilarious phone scene involving Winslet and Diaz and the trouble with call waiting. Go see this one, you won't be disappointed!! 9/10",9,2,3,3 April 2007
Zero Dark Thirty," Oh I don't know...
","Alright so here is the unbridled version of what I think of Zero Dark Thirty, not just the movie but the hype around it. First of all, I saw nothing in the movie deserving of Oscar nominations let alone wins. But same could be said in my opinion for Argo, Lincoln, Django, Anna Karenina, and more. It was a weak, weak year for Oscar movies. I believe this was nominated for two reasons...1. The Academy likes Kathryn Bigelow because she's so close with James Cameron who is rich enough that he basically runs the show and 2. Left wing Hollywood enjoyed that right wing Washington hated this movie. Also I am so sick and tired of hearing people complain about how its fake, untrue, supportive of torture blah blah blah on and on. Then these same people complain about how long it is (which it is excruciatingly long.) So many mainstream movie goers expected it to be a blow things up action flick and its not. Its a lonnnng, drawn out investigation to find Bin Laden. Fortunately for me, I had read enough on the film that I knew it was lonnnnng and drawn out. But for those complaining about the legitimacy of the movie...ITS A MOVIE!! I don't care what it's 'based on' or who told them facts...its ALWAYS A MOVIE. So I am reviewing this on entertainment merit. The investigation is long but interesting enough. The performances are okay albeit a little over intense at times but I suppose the situation would be over intense. I do think the film would have been more effective and more interesting at 45 minutes shorter at least.All right so its no secret that I can't stand Jessica Chastain. I think watching her is equivalent to watching that one girl in High School that thought she could act so she over dramatized everything. This is no exception. The script is rife with pointless and underwhelming obscenities and she delivers those curse words with such awkwardness that its almost painful to watch her. Her nomination for an Oscar for this silly performance is just as bad as Amy Adams' nomination for The Master or Alan Arkin for Argo. Jason Clarke on the other hand was excellent. I wish the film had spent significantly more time on his character. I wouldn't say his performance is Oscar worthy but compared to Chastain, he nails it. He is convincing and believable and strong. The supporting cast is huge and definitely lots of familiar faces. They all do a solid job in their respective roles. Some of the more stand out performances include Kyle Chandler and Harold Perrineau in small but vital roles that they did well. Having names like Mark Strong and Joel Edgerton as headliners in this is ludicrous. They're barely there and I think I remember one line from Edgerton in the whole movie.Obviously the raid is the climax of the film. It is very dark and gritty and disturbing so that part of it is done very well. It actually felt like the one part of the movie that was probably closest to accurate and didn't feel like it was dragging and full of propaganda. However (and I am the furthest thing from a Military expert or strategist) and yet I thought a few of the things they did during the raid seemed completely wrong and foolish. The way the film plays out the raid was truly an assassination mission as they move through the house killing and double killing every target. Osama's mark and death is incredibly anti-climatic, even less than hearing President Obama talk about when it happened. The script is sloppy. Every character, not just Chastain, delivers obscenities awkwardly like it was specifically thrown in there to make it R-rated and gritty. I'm not against obscenities in a film, I know as a writer that sometimes it just flows that way but it doesn't flow at all in this and feels awkward. Basically I found the movie to be incredibly off in its pacing, mediocre acting and way over hyped. Why anyone would even be remotely upset about the portrayals in this movie is beyond me considering it is a mediocre movie at best that most mainstream movie goers won't understand or want to see. It weeds out the short attention spans in the first half hour. The driving force in the film is Chastain's character's obsession with capturing Bin Laden and I'm not sure they really captured that. Even in the closing scenes when she stands over Bin Laden in what should be an inspirational and powerful scene is lack luster. There was a small low budget flick released earlier this year called Seal Team Six that I thought would be a total dud and turned out to be pretty good. I honestly feel like Seal Team Six (while not an amazing film) did a better job at making you feel for the characters and delivering entertainment. See it for yourself but it is an intense investment of nearly three hours. 6.5/10",6,0,2,22 March 2013
Crazy Heart," An incredibly powerful performance moves this film to greatness
","Crazy Heart is simply beautiful. Its touching and heartfelt and sad and perhaps brilliantly made. 99% of this rests squarely on the shoulders of the Globe, SAG etc. winning performance by Jeff Bridges who is brilliant but I'll get to that. This is a simple story about a very complex man with a history that they unfold gradually by showing where he has arrived now. One thing I normally can't stand is when they put a young actress with old men stars like Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood etc. (three of my favorite actors mind you) and they sort of do the same in Crazy Heart but there is a major difference because somehow it fits the story. The infamous former star 'Bad' Blake is a former womanizer with an oozing charm and the woman he wins over has come from a string of bad relationships and probably has some sort of 'Daddy' issues so the whole dysfunction aspect works in this case. The music in the film is really the heart of the movie and very sweet. Some very original and beautiful even haunting old time country music. My Dad raved about this film and its easy to see why as he comes from the school of country of George Jones and Johnny Cash and Hank Williams and this film encompasses all of that and the new as well.Let's talk Jeff Bridges. The man is quickly becoming, if he isn't already, an icon of acting. But this role is simply breathtaking. So far out of the Best Actor nominees this isn't even a competition. I only have two more to see and I'd be awfully surprised if anyone comes even close to Bridges. His performance is incredibly moving, emotional, sad, and brilliant. He will make you love, hate, and pity the legendary Bad Blake all while believing beyond doubt this man was a star. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Bridges' love interest, a single mother who has clearly had a tough life especially with guys. This is one of the best roles I have ever seen Gyllenhaal in and she looks great! Her and Bridges have great chemistry both romantically but also as actors play off of each other. Bridges' performance is so outstanding that it would seem hard to play against him but she holds her own. Small almost cameo roles by Robert Duvall and Colin Farrell round out the cast. Both give really great performances. I was actually very impressed with Farrell and his singing as the hot new rock/country singer. He is incredibly believable.And this is what this film is about...believability. The story, and the characters just draw you into their lives like you're watching real life unfold before you. Bit part actor Scott Cooper has hit some kind of gold as the writer and director of Crazy Heart. His talent must lie in writing because this is just a brilliant story. I fully expected the film to end poorly given that the film is at times very nearly depressing and sad overtones throughout and instead remarkably the film ends not with a picture perfect happy ending but a very solid touching, well thought out ending. The key is that clearly Cooper put his heart and soul into this and never stopped for a moment to make things easy or entertaining but instead made the film entertaining and just a very touching movie. This is a film I could see again and again and love every time. Out of all the Academy Award films this season...Crazy Heart is an absolute must see!! 9/10",9,4,8,7 February 2010
War of the Worlds," This is why we go to the movies!!
","I knew that when reading other reviews that people would be harsh against this. Any time this many people sees a movie there is bound to be difference in opinion. Nonetheless after seeing the amazing spine tingling trailers I sat in awe of one of the greatest theatrical films ever. First off you've got an amazing blockbuster combination. DirectorSteven Spielberg, this guy can't do much wrong. He's hands down the greatest director in the history of film impressing movie goers for decades and even taking some critical acclaim along the way. The guy knows how to make a blockbuster. Superstar Tom Cruisesay what you will about his personal life right now the guy is a great actor and Minority Report, the outstanding Collateral, the Mission Impossible serieshe makes a great movie star. Supporting castDakota Fanning who is becoming an incredible actress can hold her own against any star. Tim Robbins brief role was also well done and well cast.War Of The Worlds is based on H.G. Wells classic sci fi story. A father who doesn't really know how to be a father, Ray Ferrier, is left to care for his two children for the weekend while their mother and stepfather are visiting her parents. His son is a rebellious bitter teenager who is becoming a man slowly without his father. His daughter isn't quite old enough to resent him for not being around and she still needs a lot of protecting from anyone willing to provide. Suddenly everything changes when a freak storm sends Aliens from another world down to Earth and uncovers killing machines (tri-pods) that they may have buried centuries earlier. Not as much of a war as it is an extermination, the Aliens begin to destroy everything and everyone in sight. Ray barely makes it out of New York with his two children as they desperately try to make their way across the war torn, devastated country side to Boston to find the children's mother. As they make the trek Ray begins to realize that the love he has for his children will keep them all alive.First off, no other film has had special effects like thisperiod. It was amazing, astonishing, justwow!! I am sure the film was rampant with CGI but you'd never know it, it is so cleverly used and disguised. The explosions, the storms, the actual aliensjust brilliantly done. This film really is less of a sci fi action film and more of a film about human nature. You get to see so many sides, some of the horribly disturbing of the human condition. There are many, many disturbing scenes in the film that just make your stomach turn and you forget you're watching this fantasy story and you feel like you're right there with them being attacked by these aliens. One of the most disturbing scenes in the film is when Rachel Ferrier played by Dakota Fanning comes across a literal river of bodies. Even watching the Aliens destroy the human beings into dust is disturbing. There is non stop action and it just has you on the edge of your seat until the very last moment. And there we come in to the big problem of the filmthe ending. It's very tacked on and yes it's the proper ending and perfectly feasible but never properly set up. It just sort of happens and everything stops and it's over. It's a huge let down after being so built up for two hours. Nonetheless if you want the best movie of the year to see in the theateryou need to see War Of The Worlds. It's the reason movies were made, it's fun, it makes you emotional, cry out, sucks you in it's just amazing. Go see it!! 9/10",9,0,1,5 September 2005
Love Actually," Finally conquered the juggernaut of modern day classics
","I can't even fathom the amount of times I've heard people rave about Love Actually. Its one of those movies that people say they watch every year and how much they love it. I even started watching it last Christmas and just didn't make it all the way through for one reason or another. Honestly, you really have to be in the right mood to watch the film because in many ways despite it following a very predictable recipe, it is a very uniquely styled film. Love Actually is very British starring a host of very famous British actors and being set in London with all the quirky dialogue you'd expect from a British film. Its a film with multiple stories all happening at once and intersecting in small ways which some people really like. I actually think the movie maybe overdoes it with the multiple story lines because as good as everyone is and each story has its own merits, some are lost and you're left feeling like some of the characters' issues are unresolved. Still, its a funny, quirky, emotional film with a ton of familiar faces and great characters. Love Actually is unapologetically a seasonal special for adults. Nudity, bad language, sex and mature themes abound in the film which is unusual for a 'Christmas' movie but why not? Adults deserve a movie for them exclusively. Still a lot of the mature content is perhaps almost unnecessary.Talking about a cast like this is really hard because it is the definition of an ensemble cast. Its a whose who of British actors with a few Americans thrown in there too. I will list some of the more significant characters and actors. Hugh Grant (watching this made me realize how much I enjoyed him when he was in his prime as a comedic actor), Emma Thompson (always amazing), Liam Neeson, Bill Nighy (small role but absolutely adore his insane character), Gregor Fisher, Colin Firth, Martin Freeman and Joanna Page (though I could have done without their story entirely. Its unnecessarily adult and changes the tone of the movie.) Andrew Lincoln, Kiera Knightley and Chiwetel Ejiofor star in a sub-plot that I didn't particularly care for either. It could have not been there and made very little difference. Laura Linney, Alan Rickman, Martine McCutcheon, Rodrigo Santoro and Thomas Brodie-Sangster round out the main cast. I think I've really covered the main people that at least have significant screen time. As I pointed out I felt like a few of the stories took up more time than necessary and sort of cut into the stories that you really wanted to see more of like Liam Neeson's storyline with his step-son and Hugh Grant's story. Both of those (for instance) could have made their own film.Its amazing that this was Richard Curtis' directorial debut and he wrote the film as well. I also have to mention that Curtis (who has only directed two other movies since this one) directed the AMAZING (one of the best films of last year) About Time. He knows a thing or two about evoking emotions and he uses this top notch cast extremely well. I do sort of get why people adore this movie so much. It has a lot of very memorable scenes and while it is based around Christmas, it doesn't shove the idea down your throat that its a 'Christmas' movie. Its a subtle holiday film that deals with multiple versions of what 'love' is. For the romantic in all of us, you'll definitely enjoy it. It didn't floor me, in fact considering its reputation I thought it could use a little fine tuning here and there. It felt sloppy at times. Still I enjoyed myself, had some fun, and I totally get why people rave about it. Maybe the expectations were set pretty high. Definitely check it out for something a little different this holiday season. This is technically my first Holiday film for 2014 and I love my Christmas movies!! 7.5/10",7,1,2,19 November 2014
12 Years a Slave," Critical darling impresses but didn't floor me
","Let's just get this out in the open...12 Years A Slave will almost certainly win the Oscar for Best Picture. I'd put every dime on it...99% guaranteed. It has everything the Academy loves. It comes in on the tails of the impressive Django Unchained which was a very different style of slavery story but still shares some common ground. A tale set in the South during the mid-late 1800's seems to me to be an easy spot to write a good story that moves people. 12 Years A Slave does exactly that. It has a few unique ideas in it but at the same time it didn't really bring anything new to the table either. There were some very good performances, very good scenes and a powerful story. It was a great film. Best film of the year? I'm not entirely sure. I felt like some of the sexual scenes were forced and gratuitous and unnecessary. I also understand what they were trying to convey with some of these scenes. 12 Years A Slave does one of the best jobs I've ever seen of making you understand the intense humiliation of slavery. The story is very different given this is about a free man from the North who is kidnapped and sold into Southern slavery. Its a terrifying idea and the things he must go through will move you. This is a film that puts you firmly in the shoes of a man forced into slavery and every humiliating aspect. He is an educated, intelligent family man forced into this condition and its hard to watch at times.Chiwetel Ejiofor is our lead character. He is good in the role and certainly conveys a lot of different emotions and is very believable in the part. I have no beef with his performance at all. At the same time I wasn't blown away by him. There was one particular performance better in the film than him and he was great but I don't think it was a mind blowing performance. He will certainly get an Oscar nomination but I'm just not sure he deserves to win. In her film debut Lupita Nyong'o is very impressive. Her character is literally tortured and humiliated throughout the film more than any other and watching her is gut wrenching. She is a very talented actor and she shines in a very hard role. Her chemistry with Ejiofor is very good and she deserves her accolades, especially for her first big screen role. I think the best performances in this movie came from the supporting cast. Michael Fassbender is stunning...he is stunning in the way that I expected Ejiofor to be. Fassbender's drunken, religious fanatic, slave owner is twisted and electric and demented. Its an Oscar worthy performance to say the least. Sarah Paulson's smaller role as his wife is also noteworthy because I thought she was amazing too in the few scenes she had. Benedict Cumberbatch is very good as Ford, of the slave owners but one who tries to treat Northrup with some form of respect. Paul Dano is amazing as one of Ford's overseers. Dano has maybe ten or fifteen minutes on screen and is absolutely memorable. Brad Pitt also makes an appearance in a small role near the end of the film. He produced the movie and I'm not sure he should have given himself a role. I very much like Brad Pitt and I think he's a terrific actor but whether he likes it or not he's a mega superstar and its distracting to see him suddenly show up 3/4 of the way through the film. He doesn't particularly impress and its a small role.Steve McQueen sort of began to get noticed with Hunger and then Fassbender's last big critical darling 'Shame' which I have yet to see. McQueen creates an epic feel to the film but sometimes I think he forgets we need to understand the world they live in and not just the horrific things happening to them. I expected more emotion to some of the characters and I mean there is no doubting some of the more powerful scenes but this is such an incredible story and such a hard subject that it required something more. It is a great movie but for all the hype and the fact that it is likely to watch away with the best picture of the year...it needs more. It is however much better than last year's Argo so I can live with its status. Absolutely see this film because it is important and well made and well acted. A very important historical movie. 8.5/10",8,2,6,15 December 2013
30 Days of Night," An amazing spin on an old Genre with really incredible film making!!
","I've been hearing a lot about the poor turn out of films this fall but I could not disagree more because so far I have really had some good luck in watching some of the fall releases. I had so-so expectations going into 30 Days of Night and once again I was absolutely blown away as I was previously with the incredible 'We Own The Night' (See my review), the silly 'Sydney White' (See my review) and the far more serious and brilliantly acted 'Rendition' (See my review.) So now it was time for some Horror action and it has been a long time since I've seen a really good horror flick and I used to be an obsessive fan of the genre. I love slasher flicks, the numerous sequels and the gore if it's done right and as far as I'm concerned 30 Days of Night does everything right!! You have the ultimate theme and setting of isolation being set in the Northern most part of Alaska in a small mining town that sees 30 Days of Night every winter. Most town folk clear out but for a few workers, police and die hard townspeople. The feel of the film with the wind blown snow and the darkness definitely draws you into this feeling of being completely cut off from the rest of the world and works perfectly. The real magic here is the film makers way of creating the vampire. Now we all know Vampires have just about been done in every which way by Hollywood and I won't say 30 Days Of Night takes it in a completely new direction but definitely unique and some terrific special effects. The monsters are downright terrifying and have this eerie look to them. Their language (Latin?) just adds to the realism and the fear you feel for these people and they are no holds barred BRUTAL!! Josh Hartnett has had some good roles, although he's never really blown me away and it seems like he's had some issues with finding good strong adult roles but this might do it for him. I thought, having seen the trailers, that he was far too baby faced and immature to pull off being the lead guy in the role as the sheriff determined to save everyone but he actually does an excellent job. Sure it's no amazing acting feat but he keeps you riveted and gets his hands dirty and looks good doing it. Melissa George who I think does have some excellent acting ability plays Hartnett's estranged wife who ends up being stranded there as well in a freak coincidence (hey it's a horror movie.) I wouldn't describe her as the scream queen because she's far too strong to be that. Instead she turns in a very good strong female lead role that is to be reckoned with. Her and Hartnett have decent...so-so...chemistry but then it doesn't focus on that either. They don't take away from the main story to focus on romance. Ben Foster, hot on the heels of his very good performance in 310 to Yuma (see my review) plays a downright creepy stranger who tries to warn them of the impending doom but more to mock them then anything. I think he's pretty well found his niche in acting and might have a hard time finding anything else outside of that, although I remember him quite well from a teen flick called Get Over It where he played the good guy lead. I wish I had the space to break down supporting roles especially that of the vampires but I don't but I can tell you the supporting cast is terrific in their various roles and the vampire cast are all amazing and it's not just the special effects. Each one of them becomes very distinct in their style and character.Yet another music video director turned Hollywood David Slade takes the helm and I have to give him a huge kudos because the cinematography in this film is just brilliant. The overhead scenes with the torturous blood shed was brilliant and breath taking, the dark and the white snow and the vampires and just everything is brilliantly filmed and really fascinating to watch. Unlike some former music directors turned Hollywood he doesn't fall into the trap of being all over the place with his shots...instead he carefully marks them out and makes it stunning to watch and very, very unique. Maybe the story isn't entirely thrilling or new to watch but it's really good and that's what's important. They don't rush the story...in fact they take time to set up the character and the town and the impending attack. They don't even throw the gore right into your face but they don't hide it either. They won't show you every time someone gets ripped apart so you're not expecting it the next time when they zoom in on an ax taking off someones head. I've read reviewers that complain the whole movie is about this small group moving from place to place and they are right because the movie is about survival!! Of course as with any Horror film you have to suspend a certain level of reality because otherwise you'd hate every fantasy film of any kind but for being what it is, it's not the far fetched or crazy with no glaring pot holes. All in all...until Saw IV rears it's head which I'm already salivating for...30 Days of Night is a deadly killer of a movie and a must see by fans of the genre or looking for a freakishly cool night out. 9/10",9,4,9,27 October 2007
Wedding Crashers," Rather ambitious, no holds barred, laugh out loud comedy!!
","Wedding Crashers above all else is ballsy!! I don't know if that's a word but I'm making it one. It's 'R' rated which is a rarity nowadays with constant political correctness creeping up and of course the film is taking it's hits with such issues as 'The Purple Heart, Rape, racism, sexism' and I kind of support those opinions but nonetheless I have to give the film credit for being no holds barred and going for it because for the most part the film is very funny. I wanted to find it more funny, I wanted it to be as funny to me as it was to everyone else in the theater but it never really got roll in the aisles funny for me.Wedding Crashers is of course the story of two lawyers who mediate for divorcing couples and during Wedding Season they crash weddings. The two of them create elaborate back stories, study the families in the weddings and then crash them with these stories in hopes of scoring vulnerable, and hot women which they successfully do again and again and again. John Beckwith, one half of the two friends, is starting to grow weary of their philandering ways. He feels like he needs a break but Jeremy wants to pull the Wedding crash of all weddings. Secretary of treasury's daughter is getting married, and it's going to be the most elaborate wedding of all time. Finally John gives in and the two go posing as brothers. While at the wedding Jeremy picks out the brides sister as his mark and John immediately notices the other sister, the beautiful Claire Clearly. While Jeremy makes his move John makes his way to Claire and the two hit it off almost immediately. Unfortunately eventually she introduces him to her wealthy, well to do, long time boyfriend Sack. This doesn't get John down, instead he is determined to win her away from Sack. Jeremy's woman is turning out to be a psychotic clingy, obsessive woman and he's ready to bail but John is insisting they stay around for him to get more time with Claire. Jeremy's newfound girlfriend Gloria Cleary invites them both to her father's home for a weekend away and Jeremy tries to say no but John thinks it's great seeing the opportunity to get near Claire. The two men go and what follows is a roller coaster for Jeremy of trying to avoid Gloria and her crazy, very gay, artsy, rather slow brother Todd. Meanwhile John is falling hard for Claire and Sack is only showing more and more why he doesn't deserve her. Sack sees John trying to vie for his woman and he sets an investigation in motion to find out who they really are. Once their secret is uncovered John thinks he's lost Claire forever but true love will always prevail for both men.Wedding Crashers is the furthest thing from original. It's not a new story or plot or characters for the most part but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson are spectacular together and apart in this film. Owen Wilson plays the straight man to Vaughns neurotic over the top hilarious role. Vaughns expressions and one-liners are enough to keep the whole moving going. Not to mention the HUGE physical comedy he does that is just great!! Isla Fisher as Vaughn's obsessive girlfriend is hilarious although the commercials and trailers for this film kind of ruin most of her biggest comedy lines. Christopher Walken who has been known to do some great comedy is more of the straight man in the film but still a great presence to have on screen. Jane Seymour's role could have been better used and she's barely got any screen time. The hilarious Ellen Albertini Dow who plays Grandma Cleary gets most of her lines from being outrageous but still hilarious!! And the usually rather plain looking Rachel McAdams, is stunning and perfectly matched with Owen Wilson. Despite being a rather touchy comedic film for those who are not sensitive you will probably laugh to tears. I definitely laughed all the way through just not as much as I wanted to. I guess you have to be in the right mood for it. I admit I was disappointed when they entered in special guest and ANNOYING cameo Will Ferrell...another member of the Ferrell comedy troupe. I had hoped that Vaughn and Wilson were trying to break free of the crew but apparently they are still attached. Ferrell makes an appearance as THEE original Wedding Crasher Chaz Reingold. As always he has some amusing lines but completely over acts and almost ruins much of the humor built up in the film. Wedding Crashers is a can't miss comedy that is sure to at least give you several laughs. A little raunchy at times but funny!! 8.5/10",8,0,1,8 August 2005
There Will Be Blood," I'm jumping OFF this band wagon in confusion and surprise?! There 'Will' Be a lot of things...entertainment wasn't one of them
","I can say that 'usually' I am pretty on par with what the general public think of a movie although I have been known to stray my own way with certain films but I am still blown away in reading all the reviews for this film which would have someone believe that this is one of the best films of the year...an opinion shared overwhelmingly with the Academy who has bestowed numerous Oscar nominations on this film so let me be the first to say that perhaps my opinion is not right this time. However, it is my opinion and I was blown away by how truly outrageously BORING and misrepresented this movie is. I don't consider myself unintelligent by any means. I think I can certainly enjoy a great intellectual, artistic picture, and I DO love a great historical epic but I had seen the previews for this film and they represent it completely different than what the film is. There Will Be Blood should have been titled by its origin of work which was 'Oil' because that is the only thing this film is about. I get the title...its rags to riches, pulling himself from the very bottom through turbulence and trials and ends with him losing his mind basically but my god it takes him a long time to get there and everything in the middle is as boring as the sand around him.Daniel Day-Lewis is very good. I take nothing from his performance as Oil man Daniel Plainview who starts from nothing and ultimately creates an empire at no expense including his own sanity in the end. Considering his character arc covers many years and many different situations, he does a terrific job. Its just the fact that there isn't any real plot or point to the three hour film to help support him. He definitely is the focus of the film despite a small supporting cast. The only other stand out performance is that of Paul Dano, a very gifted actor coming from an awesome role in Little Miss Sunshine. His over the top, bursting performance as religious fanatic and 'healer' Eli Sunday is really something. Its comical in this dark and disturbing way. However the previews of this film imply some sort of great battle of wits between Sunday and Plainview which never happens. Instead Eli Sunday is like an annoying little bug which Plainview swats repeatedly. Dillon Freasier also does a decent job as young H.W. Plainview, who is learning the business from his father until an accident takes his hearing. Its a subtle and quiet performance but he does well.So you have these good performances, why did I dislike this movie? It is truly uneventful. I mean watching the Oil fields and the events surrounding drilling and making money is very captivating...for 30 maybe 40 minutes...but NOTHING else happens. Its the same for three hours! And then when all is said and done we have this emotional blow out between father and son after years of being apart and then the end of the film is so downright stupid and ludicrous, it just literally made me shake my head. In some ways it was the perfect ending to a film that was just a waste. I DO believe the film makers purposely mislead the general public to believe that this film is about this bloody battle between and Oil Driller and a preacher when it has nothing at all to do with that. I can't agree with anyone on this and seeing the words 'astounding, gory, disturbing' in people's reviews make me say 'What the hell were you all watching?' I literally had to fight to keep my eyes open. But to each their own...that's the beauty of art but for me this Academy Awards is shaping out to be a big disappointment. 4/10",4,47,91,6 February 2008
Burlesque," Strong actors, promising predictable story...all of it tanks into the ground in a dancing heaping mess
","Burlesque actually looked promising to me. I like musicals, I like movies about dance, I like the concept of a struggling young artist come to make it big (Coyote Ugly, Showgirls) okay maybe not Showgirls. But Showgirls is actually exactly what I could compare Burlesque to most, minus the adult content. The most disappointing thing about Burlesque is there is some really great actors that are totally wasted. The choreography for a dance film, with two incredibly talented performers, is ridiculous and almost near boring which is just sad and wasted. The characters are almost entirely vapid and empty and if it weren't for the charisma that the three main characters bring to the screen just by being there this would be a huge stinker and a whopping zip out of ten. But because I just couldn't give such a horrible score to the likes of Cher and Tucci. Still even little girls looking for glitz and glam can't find much of anything to hang on to in this. It is a mess and you will see why reviews and theatre performance was so bad.Christina Aguilera in her debut big screen role is Ali, the young and headstrong singer/dance that wants to be the title role in the Burlesque show that enamours her. There is nothing wrong per se with her acting ability. I think her character was written with very little depth other than the obvious. I think its unfortunate because she probably has some acting ability. Academy Award Winner, the legendary Cher should be perfect as the head of the show, a sassy, and jaded club owner. Again...no depth. You can list her characters qualities on one hand. She is still luminescent on screen because...well...she's Cher. Stanley Tucci as usual steals his scenes as Cher's best friend and business partner. Tucci is just such an incredible actor, he can make any role seem better than it is. This is no exception. Peter Gallagher also has a really good role in the film that actually has a little bit of depth but he is way underused but he does a good job with what he is given. The stunning beauty but utterly boring in this film Julianne Hough plays one of the dancers, Georgia. The supporting cast especially the Burlesque girls are utterly wasted and pointless. That's unfortunate too given they hired girls with actual names like Glee's Dianna Agron, and Kristen Bell.So who is to blame for this potential filled but utterly wasted mess? Director and writer Steve Antin is not a long time professional. He has a few credits to his name but certainly nothing substantial. I think maybe his screenplay lacked depth and he just missed a lot of key emotional elements. How he, or the studio, got the likes of the above actors to join this is a mystery...especially Cher. I have to keep going back to her because she has done some brilliant acting roles (my personal favourite is Mermaids.) This is her first significant role in ten years and she followed it up as the voice of an animal in Zookeeper...what you doing Cher? After this you're gonna wanna turn back time. This will also put a roadblock up against Christina Aguilera's acting career and I just don't think that's fair because this script was not good for anyone. Steer clear of this wreck because there is very little redeemable qualities about it. 4/10",Null,0,1,23 August 2011
To Kill a Mockingbird," The sheer definition of a classic and possibly the most important film ever made
","I'm not the only reviewer to state how important this film is. I have seen it before but its been years. I fell in love with the book when I read it in High School and the film is probably one of, if not thee, most beloved adaptations to film ever made and its easy to see why. The same heart and soul that brings the book to life comes through in the film equally and that is no easy feat. Its a coming of age film, but its also a film completely and utterly indicative of its time and locale. You're not watching a movie, you are completely involved in this little town and in the Finch family. You are standing right there with Scout and Jem and you are in silent awe of the powerful and yet subtle man that is Atticus Finch. Gregory Peck was likely born to play this role as was several of the other characters. The film is so mysterious in the way they approach Boo Radley that you are literally a kid on the street with them anxious and curious about Radley. For whatever reason we don't see the accused Tom Robinson until well through halfway the film. Despite being black and white, there is something vibrant and completely powerful about the setting of the film. And the closing battle in the courtroom is easily one of the most awe inspiring scenes in cinema history period.Gregory Peck was an icon of Hollywood long before this and long after. I'm not sure I've even see other work by him yet. His portrayal of Atticus Finch is easily the most respected performance in cinema and its easy to see why because it is just a natural, fluid performance. He's quiet, stoic, low key and yet behind all of this you see the fire and passion for justice, a wild side of youth, the fierce protective streak he has for his children, the sadness of losing his wife...the performance is mesmerizing. You would think anyone else acting with him would pale in comparison but not the case at all. Mary Badham (Oscar nominated performance) and Phillip Alford give two of the best young person performances I've ever soon. They are completely amazing as siblings Scout and Jem. Their chemistry is untouchable, their performance mesmerizing, and the three of them (with Peck) are unbelievable. Even still this doesn't count on the amazing cast performance from the supporting characters. John Megna, Frank Overton, Brock Peters, Estelle Evans, Collin Paxton, Richard Hale, James Anderson and Robert Duvall (in his debut performance) make what is one of the best casts of a film ever. They make this little dirt poor town come to life and you don't feel empathy for them as much as you just feel like you are there experiencing it.Nowadays when a director comes exclusively from Television, I find that they have a really hard time translating stories into feature length films as opposed to serialized like TV. Director Robert Mulligan did come from Television and yet it seems like he had this ability to take an entire series worth of character development and make these characters come to life in just over two hours. He tells a lifetime of a story in one feature film and its unforgettable. That is what makes To Kill A Mockingbird a classic...you watch it and you will never forget it. Lines that Scout and Atticus speak, Peck's infamous closing dialogue at the trial, Boo Radley's appearance...you can just watch this again and again and take something different away from it or experience it as though you were watching for the first time. If you wonder where Hollywood Magic has gone...watch this and see when that Magic was at its height. 10/10",10,1,3,4 September 2015
Man on Fire," Check your ego Washington!
","Man On Fire was captivating, action filled, and a mite confusing. Denzel Washington has always been a guy to trust when it came to great movies. He's fiery and easy to watch, chooses incredible, powerful scripts but sadly if his head gets any bigger they will have to double the size of the theatre for his next film. Man On Fire is the story of a washed up, depressed former agent of some sorts. One of the interesting things about this film is that it gives no back story on Washington's character Creasy. Tony Scott who has directed some killer success films went a little out of his way to be original with this film I think. Washington's character is mysterious and unknown and we as the viewer are literally dropped into his life without any previous explanation leaving us to try and piece together the little hints dropped about his past. The story is that Creasy is hired by a seemingly wealthy Mexican business man played quite impressively by Mr. Jennifer Lopez...Mennifer? to protect his daughter played (needless to say BRILLIANTLY) by Dakota Fanning...shouldn't this girl get an Oscar for everything she acts in? Living in Mexico city where the kidnap/ransom rate is through the roof, Creasy appears to be incompetent and irresponsible for the job but his former partner or boss or friend or fellow agent Rayburn played by Christopher Walken recommends him. Fanning's character slowly begins to open Creasy's up making him feel for someone again and making him clean up his act in order to fully protect her. Unfortunately it's not in time for kidnappers, with the help of crooked Mexico cops/organized criminals to kidnap and 'kill her.' In anger Creasy exacts revenge on everyone who benefited, was involved in, or had a hand in the kidnapping. He's cold blooded and deadly serious and at the same time unravels the criminal chain involved in numerous kidnapping. The story has enough action and intense scenes to keep you riveted to your seat. Scott attempts a unique style in his direction with seemingly music video editing which is often annoying and used too frequently. I understand his reasoning but it's overused. The cast is terrific but Washington just seems so blatantly egotistical in all his roles lately. It's like he's doing a terrific job and his eyes are saying...look at me act, I am the best. Dakota Fanning is the most brilliant child actor I have ever seen as always. This film is definitely worth seeing, it's a nail biter and a good time in general. See it!! 7/10",Null,0,2,20 October 2004
Edge of Tomorrow," A Sci-Fi Flick that will inevitably be very under-rated
","I still think Tom Cruise has got it. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie that he wasn't at least 'decent' in and he's been around a long time and has some truly outstanding movies. In reality he's probably one of my top five favourite actors period. I don't care about his personal life. Oblivion let me down quite a bit. I thought it was a mess in a lot of ways and tried way too hard. I had decent expectations of this and its a tough sell because of the obvious comparisons to the aforementioned film last year. Edge of Tomorrow is as different as night and day to Oblivion. It is a special effects drive, science fiction blockbuster that is worthy of its fans that are really trying to talk it up. It seems to be getting lost in the summer shuffle but I promise you that at some point this will be considered and under-rated classic and for good reason. It is fiercely intelligent, hits all the right science fiction notes and the sort of unique time travel aspect makes it very nearly riveting. Honestly, this probably would have been a nine for me if not for the silly, non-sensical and forced ending. I would love for someone to try and explain to me how the ending works so that I can change my review to a 9. I'm also thinking there were absolutely some inevitable plot holes but how could there not be when dealing so blatantly with time travel. 99% of the special effects were spot, even the 3D was decent (I hate 3D in general and think its a huge money grabbing gimmick.) Tom Cruise commands the lead and does what he does best. He probably has more charisma on screen than any other actor in history. There is just something mesmerizing about him. But its not just his charisma because he is actually a great and versatile actor. You just accept him as the hero. His character starts as cocky, a 'salesman' of sorts and the fear he shows when he is railroaded into being a soldier...was outstanding. This is no Oscar performance but as an 'action/Sci-Fi' hero, he absolutely nails it. He was perfect. This also might be the first film where I can say I really enjoyed Emily Blunt. I always feel like she is miscast in her roles and have never been impressed by her. As the female hero in the film she holds her own. She is edgy and strong and as good of an action star as Cruise is. Women should flock to and love this character because quite frankly she's bad ass. I think I could have done without the inevitable implied romance between her and Cruise but its used sparingly and not a driving force in the film at all. The two stars are definitely the focal point of the movie but that's not to say the supporting cast don't deserve mention. There are vital characters played very well in various sized roles. Some of the most significant performances were Bill Paxton, Brendan Gleeson, Madeleine Mantock (would have loved to have seen more of her character), Dragomir Mrsic, Jonas Armstrong and everyone else that played in J-Squad. I really wanted to see more from that entire group but understandably this wasn't the focus.Doug Liman has had some very good films as a director. He has done a Bourne Film, Fair Game and Mr. and Mrs Smith. However, he's never really done a sci-fi flick and I'm surprised because he handled it nearly perfectly. The cinematography was outstanding, the special effects excellent and for any lover of Sci-Fi you will appreciate this for being a terrific flick in that genre. Liman knows how to make a great script come to life and this proves that again. My one biggest annoyance were the 'mimics' or the alien species they are up against. I thought their CGI was lacklustre at best. They looked hokey and that was unfortunate given how good everything else was. There is no human villain at all which is different but the mimics and the time travel aspect give you everything you could want from this story. Its far from the most intelligent science fiction movie but it does hold its own. Its a mainstream blockbuster that actually requires you to think. It has a few moments of appropriately timed and toned comedy, the fish out of water scenes in the beginning are just perfect and this is just sheer entertainment that you can and should enjoy. Don't hesitate to see this!! 8.5/10",8,1,4,15 June 2014
Pitch Perfect 2," A movie that didn't need a sequel gets a fortunately solid one
","The first Pitch Perfect came out of left field and bowled most of us over. It is one of the best and most fun comedy musicals ever and a modern day classic already in my opinion. Did it need a sequel? Absolutely not. But Hollywood can't ever say no to more potential money so a sequel was green lit. I was cautiously optimistic because as much as it didn't need a sequel, I wanted to have fun with the Bellas again and wanted it to be good! Pitch Perfect 2 isn't as good as the first one...there is no way around that...but it is a worthy sequel, a ton of fun, makes sense, good characters, new songs, new ideas and its well worth your time especially if you're a fan of the first one. You know what to expect because they were smart not to change the formula of the film. Pitch Perfect is what is has always been and that's a good thing. There aren't a lot of changes or surprises but if something ain't broke, don't fix it! There are plenty of laughs and ridiculous antics and they do sort of play on some of the same jokes but that is to be expected. A lot of negative reviews mention the crass 'racist' and 'homophobic' jokes and as always people are too sensitive but I get where they're coming from. The Hispanic character is almost too much to bear.Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow return to lead the Bellas to the World Championships. The three of them are very good, Snow and Kendrick have great chemistry but its a little less obvious as it was in the first film because presumably the characters are already established. Wilson being Wilson there is always the danger of her being overused but both the first film and now this one, she is used just the right amount and very funny in a crass sort of way. Skylar Astin and Adam Devine also return in smaller roles this time around but they are meant to be supporting characters as are Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee and Ester Dean who are way in the background this time around. That's a wise choice though since they're funny schtick was really done in the first film. Anna Camp returns in a small but very good cameo. Ben Platt gets a slightly bigger role (and technically the romantic lead) than in the first film and he's very good and adorable in his role. The newcomer everyone is talking about is Hailee Steinfeld who I adore. I knew she would be an It-Girl from the first time she graced our screens in True Grit. This girl is a fantastic actress and a great singer as it turns out. She is a welcomed addition to the cast, has good chemistry with Kendrick and could lead the film series going forward. The romance with Platt is adorable and while they don't focus on it as much as they did in the first film with Kendrick and Astin it is still very good.It is very easy to decide whether you will like this film. If you enjoyed the first one, this is more of the same in all the right ways. Elizabeth Banks gives her directorial debut with this film and she shows some talent for sure but the ground work had already been laid. I'm impressed that screenwriter Kay Cannon isn't someone who has been around in film for ages but clearly knows comedy and knows what works. Pitch Perfect 2 is fun!! It is a worthy sequel that builds on its characters but mostly just continues the story from the first. A perfect date night movie that anyone can enjoy. 8/10",8,10,16,4 June 2015
Whiplash," Where did this movie come from...doesn't matter...you won't ever forget it...period.
","This was the final film I needed to see for a couple of reasons. One it is the last of the Academy Award Best Picture nominees that I needed to see. It is also the last film I wanted to see before I went ahead and did my personal best of 2014 list. Good thing I waited because guess what? Whiplash is on it. Whiplash is headlining it. In the last three weeks of trying to see the best of 2014, I found THREE films that I am giving a huge ten to without hesitation. I suspected Whiplash would be good, I just don't understand where it came from. I may have seen a trailer once but for it to show up as a best picture nominee was perplexing. I didn't hear it doing particularly well or even any reviews on it. Whiplash is mesmerizing. Whiplash is an instant classic. Whiplash is probably the best film of 2014. I was entranced. My jaw was dropped for much of it and it is one of the best performances in a film I have ever seen. Whiplash is phenomenal and that doesn't do it justice. It is gut wrenching and expressive and explosive and if you are any kind of musician you will adore this film and if you love jazz or percussion music...well you'll just explode with joy. I could literally go back and watch this again as soon as the credits are done rolling and be blown away all over. Whiplash is a must see film in every sense of the word.This is easily the performance of Miles Teller young career. This should cement him as a serious actor in any genre. He's funny...we knew that and quirky but this role proves he has chops. The fact that he plays the drums (how much of it was actually him matters very little) because he gives a very real and incredible performance. At first I wasn't sure he had the guts to stay on par with Oscar nominated JK Simmons (I'll get to him in a minute) but as the film went on I began to see him rise up and show some incredible grit and realize he was holding his own and carrying the film very well. Teller was amazing. If Teller was amazing then JK Simmons took his role to a place you rarely see. Call it a whole new plain of performance existence. Simmons playing the borderline insane Fletcher is stunning. He is frightening and evil and driven and somehow you begin to understand him and when you think he's softening he comes back with another blow. The relationship between these two is fascinating and incredible complex. Simmons deserves this Oscar without a single doubt. He's always been a great character actor but this is a whole new level. Paul Reiser, Melissa Benoist, Austin Stowell and Nate Lang are a few of the small supporting characters who do decently. But this is the type of film where you have two heavyweight performances and the entire film is focusing squarely on them.Its actually amazing that Damien Chazelle who wrote and directed this film is very new to Hollywood. Its pretty rare to find raw talent that comes out of nowhere and gives you this incredible passionate story but you can easily tell this is a labour of love for him. The story seems to come from somewhere beyond just an active imagination, maybe some truth in there somewhere. Whether you're a musician or not, you will love this film. The characters are vivid and in your face and the story, while we've seen similar before, is unlike anything before it because of the actors and the way the story unfolds. I didn't want it to end. The film is definitely for adults given its extreme bad language bordering on gratuitous but it works in the context of the film. This is likely to be overlooked at the Oscars but make no mistake, there is a reason this is nominated. It is flat out brilliant. 10/10",10,0,2,31 January 2015
Scream 2," From Scream to Screaming more...Scream 2 proves horror sequels worthwhile
","The first Scream gave an entire new generation of Horror fans a brilliant series. It only stood to reason they would rush to make a sequel a year later. The amazing part is that Scream 2, in most people's opinions easily sits on the plateau of the original and in some ways even exceeds the original film. The story is stronger, the cast is thoroughly established, and they are in a whole new setting ripe for the Ghostface killer. The film makers are incredibly smart because they stuck to the 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' method by keeping everything that made the original Scream successful and top notch. Best of all they took the incredibly clever satire that made the first one a huge success and turned up the intelligent and fun horror spoofing. The two films together make probably one of the best slasher flicks in the nineties easily. If anything director Wes Craven knew exactly how to keep the success rolling and that makes anyone who loves horror smile because it means you will be ferociously entertained and blown away by something that is smarter and truly a pop culture revolution.The entire original main cast come back stronger than ever. Neve Campbell, Liev Schreiber (really terrific and his character is even better), Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy all come back and are truly better than they were the first time around. Their characters are more developed, we know their background and what they've been through and their older and in a new place in their lives. Schreiber and Kennedy are both better than they were the first time around and more main character. As in the first film Scream 2 gives us a host of hot young newcomers and Hollywood 'It' kids including Jada Pinkett Smith (classic beginning horror scene that she is great in), Omar Epps (same for him), Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joshua Jackson, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, and Portia de Rossi. Also new to the cast is Sydney's (Campbell) new boyfriend Jerry O'Connell who is really great as one of the male heroes in the film. Him and Campbell have great chemistry as well.There is no question that Wes Craven is a horror master but Scream proved his direction was timeless. He returns to helm the perfect (and superior) sequel and Kevin Williamson returns to pen the script. The setting of the college campus and sorority house would seem to be terribly predictable and yet Scream 2 pulls off their clever satire and poke fun at the horror genre and itself at the same time and at a whole new level even above the original. Unlike other slasher flicks Scream has always been known for revealing the killer in the end and the story and twist at the end fits everything into a neat little package (unlike Scream 3.) Regardless any horror fans needs to see the entire trilogy especially with a fourth installment on the way, but Scream will give you a whole new perspective on slasher flicks, Scream 2 will demonstrate the sequel to a slasher flick exceeding even its original. Watch it!! 9/10",9,0,1,11 July 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A sub par effort in a historically incredible action series
","Now I am writing this having most recently seen the fourth installment Live Free or Die Hard so I am surrounded by the brilliance that was Die Hard, Die Harder and Live Free and With a Vengeance does hold a candle or small lighter to any of the other installments. It's my opinion that Die Hard With a Vengeance was rushed and put together to get another Die Hard out there although I must give it respect for holding a certain amount of 'Die Hard' fans if you'll excuse the pun because I know there are people who have a great deal of respect and love this entry and kudos to them because With A Vengeance has some very unique and important details about it. It is now a decent bridge between Die Harder and Live Free because John McClane is divorced from Holly, a barely functioning alcoholic, suspending from the NYPD, but he jumps right back into action when it involves saving lives and kicking bad guy ass without barely questioning it. This is the first time McClane gets a real sidekick in the action with him, something they continue in Live Free or Die Hard. It also bridges the first and third films by bringing a villain into the mix who supposedly wants Vengeance for the death of his brother Hans Gruber (played wickedly by Alan Rickman in the original Die Hard.) Most of the Die Hard elements are here but yet the story is a little more...well story. With A Vengeance seems to focus more on the actual story than the action. Compared to the other three films With A Vengeance is very, very light on the action despite opening up with a big bang. It appears to go more for suspense, thriller, and dialog then the typical action sequences of the other installments.Still you can't say anything bad about the master of the action film Mr. Bruce Willis who brings his kick butt action hero John McClane back and is still watchable, fun, and one of the best action heroes in history. Say what you will about Willis and his acting ability (although personally I think he's a terrific actor) the man is a presence on screen and makes the film worthwhile. Enter the first real side kick for John McClane. Who could possibly be man enough to put with up with McClane's antics? Samuel L. Jackson, one of the coolest mutha %#$#&*&! on the planet. Jackson plays street wise, white hating, store owner Zeus Carver. Now Jackson also gets the character with the most story, background and interesting plot line as he is forced to work with someone he doesn't like in order to save innocent people. Carver and McClane are practically identical. Willis and Jackson have great chemistry together and Jackson doesn't take the spotlight away from Willis which he could easily do. Zeus Carver becomes a Die Hard icon. Jeremy Irons continues the villainous terrorist streak by portraying Simon Gruber. Irons is appropriately evil and has no thought to innocent bystanders (although spares a school of children mostly for his own fun.) Irons is the perfect Die Hard villain for certain. He is right up there close to Rickman. Larry Bryggman, and Graham Greene are the forefront police officers on the other end of McClane's walkie talkie and they do a decent job as well keeping in time with the Die Hard recipe.The cast are all great. And there is enough interesting moments in the film to keep you interested but it just doesn't put you on the edge of your seat like every other Die Hard film has done. The story is a little slower, a little action focused and too much time is spent establishing the 'big bad heist' going on. On top of that I don't think the fight sequences that do exist are nearly the quality you'd expect from Die Hard. This is all very surprising seeing as how original Die Hard director John McTiernan returns to the helm. But then McTiernan has since fallen into the same trouble with other films he has directed, too much story in an action genre. You can still a great story and still have intense action (Live Free or Die Hard for example.) Die Hard With A Vengeance just seems to drag and I know many will hate me for saying it but it just doesn't live up to the other installments. That being said it has to be seen...case closed...it's an important entry into the series and a 90's classic so you can't not see it...just don't have high expectations and you'll be fine. 7/10",7,0,3,8 July 2007
Con Air," A breath taking action classic
","Con Air is one of those movies for me that I am certain when I first saw it...it was a ten. A huge flat out ten. It has incredible performances, tons of action, a great story, incredible actors and memorable moments for an action film. It is in a league of its own in the genre and could be considered an action 'epic.' Now I have seen the film dozens of times and I'm entertained by it every time but eventually it does have to wear thin so its dropped down a tiny peg for me and now sits comfortable forever with a solid 9. Con Air is perfect in its simplistic concept. A war hero accidentally kills a man defending himself and his wife, spends many years in prison and when he is moments from being released he inadvertently ends up being the last hope in stopping a group of terrifying ruthless villains. The best thing to come out of Con Air is the characterizations of the villains. There are so many great actors and performances that it would take a skilled film maker to make sure no one gets lost in the shuffle and everyone gets their moment. Ironically I felt watching it this time that the most underdeveloped character is actually the hero himself. We know he's a former soldier, trained to kill, and adores his family. He's soft spoken but steadfast in his morals. Outside of that we don't know a lot about him. Its almost like he's not the focus of the film. Regardless, each scene, each moment, the music, the characters...everything falls together in one of the most entertaining films in this genre.Nicholas Cage was flying high at this point coming from his Oscar win and having a truly epic trilogy of action films in 96/97 with this film, The Rock and Face Off. This was Cage at his best in my books. He is understated but full of strength as Cameron Poe and you just root for this guy because much like Bruce Willis in Die Hard, he is literally in the wrong place at the wrong time and just wants to get home. The rest of the good guys are also very good. John Cusack is terrific as the fast talking Vince Larkin and the scenes towards the end with him and Cage are just awesome. Colm Meaney is also a lot of fun as Duncan Malloy who is constantly at odds with Cusack and ends up being the butt of a lot of...damage. Now how can I talk meaningfully to this incredible cast of villains. First of all John Malkovich as always is stunning. No one does villainy like this guy and his portrayal of Cyrus The Virus is untouchable. He is perfect period. But that doesn't take away from the truly outstanding performances from Ving Rhames, MC Gainey, Dave Chappelle (and I can't stand this guy normally), Nick Chinlund and Danny Trejo. Now some of them have very small parts but Rhames, Chinlund and Gainey are truly fantastic. And then you have in my opinion was the best performance ever from Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene. This performance haunts me because he does it so well. He is truly twisted and just gives off this aura that is sick and twisted. Entire films could be based just on his character alone.This is truly one of those films where everything just works. Director Simon West knows action. He is actually one of my top action director favourites because of films like this The Mechanic and The Expendables 2. I think he just is truly a fan of action films because he seems to have a style in his direction that is reminiscent of classic actioners like Die Hard and Rambo and films like that. There is nothing that you won't find in Con Air if you love the genre. Car chases, air-plane scenes, gun fights, 'cops and robbers', explosions, crashes, hand to hand combat...this film literally has everything. But the reason it is so great is because it has all that AND amazing performances AND a terrific story too. If you haven't seen this you are truly missing out and if you have its time to watch it again. This is one way you are always guaranteed entertainment. 9.5/10",9,6,8,18 November 2014
August Rush," Really beautiful and the first of the truly moving Holiday films
","August Rush will bring some to tears. It'll be the people that have big hearts and love to open them and imagine and believe in destiny and magic. Then you'll have the realism driven, hard core, non-believers (Muggles if you will) who will likely be driven to vomit by the entirely sweet and moving August Rush. I figure critics will likely fall under the latter category but this might be the first film to really touch movie goers for the Holiday Season because although it's not Christmas focused at all it has this magic and destiny feel to it that is just downright sweet. On top of that there is some really great performances and while the film is not a musical, music plays a bigger role in this film than in some musicals. Aside from the completely non-descriptive one night stand on the roof top (it barely shows them kiss) and some scary moments involving the kids and their street caretaker the film is squeaky clean. A perfect family movie that everyone can love. Although never compared to or sold as a retelling the comparisons to Oliver Twist, to me, were glaring and that's not a bad thing. There just was a lot of comparisons and yet a completely different story.Freddie Highmore might be one of the greatest young actors of recent years. I really hope he finds his niche in adult acting but for the time being he really is amazing as the charismatic naive and perhaps slightly autistic...August Rush. I say slightly autistic not because it's ever mentioned but perhaps the way the character is portrayed. He has this unbelievable talent for music (coming from the fact both his parents are talented musicians) but he also has these moments where he loses himself in the music and hears beats in absolutely everything. His performance is magical, almost as magical as his unbelievable performance in Finding Neverland (see my review.) He easily carries this film on his own. Keri Russell is lovely and enchanting as Lyla Novacek, the boy's mother who has thought for the past 11 years that her son had died. Russell is very emotional and just a spectacle to watch and really draws you into the various emotions that she feels. She definitely captures the loving mother and the determined woman. Jonathan Rhys Meyers is charismatic and charming as the rocker Louis Connelly and the boy's father. Meyers and Russell really do have spectacular chemistry in their very brief romance and you want them to come back together because they both play such incredibly emotional characters. You become enthralled with the parents and the boy and the family they could be. Robin Williams turns in one of his greatest performances in ages and I absolutely adore Williams especially in serious roles. He plays slightly mislead homeless leader Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace. He has taken it upon himself to take in homeless kids and use their musical talents to collect funds out on the street. He takes a special interest in the incredibly talent August Rush and even gives him the name. He's not a bad guy per se, he does take care of the kids but he is overbearing and self involved and really goes off the deep end over August. Terrence Howard turns in a small and a little toned down performance as the determined and caring Social Worker who wants to reunite Russell with her son. Howard is a fine actor as shown earlier this year in The Brave One (see my review) but he's not given one of the bigger and more important roles and not a lot to work with so he kind of gets out shined.I am not a musical expert nor a musician of any kind, much to my disappointment so they could have played those instruments in the film with their feet and it couldn't have mattered to me. But apparently it is really a HUGE deal that some or all of the actors weren't actually play their instruments in particular Russell's 'Horrid' Cello performance. I'm quoting a reviewer on IMDb that said it ruined the whole film for her and that is really very sad because her acting was spot on and whether or not she held the cello right had nothing to do with magic and emotion of this film. It was really about destiny and of course you have to suspend belief a little to truly appreciate it because ultimately it's a modern day fairy tale and it's beautiful and sweet and I think people should stop over analyzing and enjoy it for what it is because it is so very entertaining and will bring tears to your eyes and a tap to your shoe. It's an adventure about an Orphan boy who just wants to have his music heard because he knows it will bring his parents back to him. Take the kids, take the family...it's just simply beautiful. 9/10",Null,4,7,27 November 2007
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Yet another disappointing entry from the Will Ferrell comedy troupe
","Say what you will...to me...the movie blew!! It was typical of what today's comedies have become. Will Ferrell is THEE most over-rated 'star' in Hollywood, not to mention overused. He ruined Bewitched, and he acts the same and overacts the same in every single film. He constantly behaves like he is still doing a 3 minute skit on SNL and that doesn't cut it in my movie watching book. Fortunately for him, most people disagree whole heartedly and love him and this film. The group that I have come to refer to as 'The Will Ferrell comedy Troup' even though Ferrell is not always there are full force in Anchorman with the usual appearances by Ben Stiller, and a Wilson brother (Luke in this case.) The worst part of Anchorman is the sheer lack of plot. A film, unlike a comedy skit, needs a plot and this film has none.Anchorman is set in the seventies, or tries to be, and centers on infamous local Anchorman Ron Burgundy. Supposedly this takes place in a time when Newsmen ruled the cities, citizens respected them and idolized them. It was a time when men reigned supreme. Ron Burgundy thinks he's got life by the throat until his world is turned upside down by the introduction of a female newscaster Veronica Corningstone. The news team jokes about it, makes fun of her and hits on her constantly. Unaware that a woman can do their job they think the only reason for her to be there is for them to bed. They all have their go but only the suave and handsome Ron gets to her and they end up having an affair to which Ron can't keep quiet about. Veronica is furious because she wants to be taken seriously as anchor. While on his way to work Ron accidentally causes a motorcycle accident with a rather angry motorist (guest star Jack Black...one of the few highlights of the film) and the motorcyclist angrily kicks Ron's beloved pet dog over the side of the bridge. Devastated Ron is late for work and Veronica offers to cover for him and reluctantly station manager Ed Harken allows it and Veronica is a bonified hit with the ratings. When Ron discovers that Veronica did HIS news, he is furious and dumps her on the spot. This sparks a horrendous feud between the two of them, each trying to do something more horrible to the other until eventually Veronica pulls a prank that gets Ron fired. Ron sinks into a bout of depression until an event arises that could put him back on top and give him everything back he loves dearly.Now I won't say there is nothing redeemable about Anchorman. There are some funny spots such as the massive battle between the news stations, where guest stars Vince Vaughn (who makes several appearances and is a regular member of the Ferrell comedy troupe), Tim Robbins (surprising appearance but brief nonetheless), and Ben Stiller. Some of the insults and banter between Ferrell and Christina Applegate who plays Corningstone is funny but overdone which can't be helped with Ferrell. The rest of the cast, the news team in particular all behave like they are part of an SNL skit and it doesn't work, not for the hour and a half of movie time. There is some very small redemption in the film but for me I would never, ever sit through it again. Ferrell is unbearable and I think he causes everyone around him to be unbearable too. The whole team that has recently popped up in numerous comedies with each other should split up and try something different this was disastrous. Worse than Starsky and Hutch!! Another comedy Troupe special. 3/10",3,2,4,5 August 2005
American Gangster," A little over hyped and over rated but some impressive developments from a strong script
","When American Gangster released they made it seem like this was this years 'The Departed' and it featured a strong and talented cast and director and the 'based on a true story' premise. So I did eagerly want to see it and I won't say I was disappointed, I only say that I thought they jumped the gun with all the praise because with some minor stand out moments and performances American Gangster was pretty all around average. The story dragged and was brutally long and despite reviewers and critics saying that it flew by, for me it felt long and too long at that. While the film was an interesting look at two men on two different sides of the law, both outcasts within their own people it just doesn't really appeal to people that might expect something like The Godfather, or other mafia type epics. The film definitely tries to be and feel epic but I don't think it hits the mark. Director Ridley Scott is probably one of the most versatile directors in Hollywood. I don't think you can ever know what to expect from the guy. He can do Sci-Fi, drama, Action, historical Epic and you just don't know how he's going to do it. I think he really set out to make this about the characters and I suppose from that perspective he was very successful.Denzel Washington used to be one of my favorite actors. Gradually I saw his ego over take his talent and you could barely watch his films without seeing his enormous ego screaming 'I am Denzel.' So I was very pleased to discover a really stirring and moving performance (perhaps Oscar nominated?) by him as underground Drug Kingpin Frank Lucas. Maybe his ego just fits well with Lucas but regardless Washington is cold blooded and ruthless and powerful and yet somehow a sympathetic character. Definitely his best role in years. Opposite him is the amazing Russell Crowe as ethically strong Det. Richie Roberts. Roberts is ethical to a fault and is looked down on by some of his fellow officers but essentially makes him the prime candidate to go after what is fast becoming the largest mob drug lord in the city. Washington and Crowe don't share a lot of screen time and yet have good chemistry playing off of each other. Their characters independently hold the film together and make it interesting enough because they are so different and yet in some ways face the same problems in their respective lives. I'd like to point out other cast members but essentially it's all about Crowe and Washington and no one else really gets to stand out or is given anything to really work with. All the eggs are in two baskets in this case and that might be part of the fault of the film.The film has it's moments of sheer brutality which are literally jaw dropping and it also has some really intense and smart moments but then it's gummed up by all this middle stuff that just seems to make it drag for it's 2 hour 40 minute running time. Despite being set in the sixties and seventies nothing really sets the time period out with the exception of some clothing and such but I thought the focus on a 'black' gangster who basically takes over the drug running business from The Italians in this time period would be more of a focus. Regardless of how you look at the film it's a stunning example of the talent of Washington and Crowe but unfortunately doesn't go much further than that. Some will enjoy it and others will agree with me that it fits some of the bill but it's just far too long. 6.5/10",6,2,4,26 November 2007
Stranger Than Fiction," Bizaar and unusual and yet endearing and captivating
","Stranger Than Fiction has a very unique concept and at first glance seems very bizarre and perhaps a deliberate attempt to be artistic and strange and yet for this film it works and it pulls off that attempt to the greatest degree. The film frightened me right from square one because of it's main star...Mr. Will Ferrell. I have never been a Ferrell fan and I find his comedy and acting overblown, overacted, and completely foolish so the idea of him carrying what appeared to be at best a dark comedy seemed nearly impossible and the idea of me enjoying it was up there too. But the idea got the better of me and I tried it out and FINALLY Will Ferrell pulled off a decent, believable, and almost emotional performance. On top of that the story is intelligent and intriguing and despite a bit of a tacked on closing to the film it's a very view-worthy film.As I said Will Ferrell headlines the film as IRS Auditor Harold Crick who is a creature of habit in the worst way, to the point where he is nearly obsessive compulsive without it ever occurring to him. His life and views on life begins to change dramatically when he discovers that his life may be out of his control and spiraling towards demise which leads him on a bit of a self discovering adventure. Ferrell truly does try his utmost to keep the role serious but comedic in a dark subtle way. There a few moments when he seems to almost lose it but he manages to pull it back together and make it work. By the end of the film he has the part down to a science and almost moves you to tears with his performance. I would much rather see Ferrell do this kind of role than his Saturday night skits over and over again for two hours each time. Emma Thompson rounds out the cast as the overtly eccentric and reclusive writer Karen Eiffle who happens to be writing the story of Harold Crick without realizing it. Her fiction is his life and she is writing him to a dramatic, ironic demise. Her steady, strong voice makes an interesting narrative while her rather zany character makes her interesting to watch. She does a good job in a mostly small, supportive role. Also noteworthy is the amazing Dustin Hoffman whom I love. He plays a small cameo type role as the English Professor trying to help Harold figure out who his narrator is and what his story will be. Hoffman has some great lines and as small as his character is, he immediately adds points to the film for just being there. And finally Harold's newfound love interest is Maggie Gyllenhaal, almost the oddest choice for a romantic interest to Will Ferrell as you can get and yet they fit together and seem so right for each other, it's almost disturbing but their romance doesn't whirlwind by any means and unfolds gradually throughout the film and makes a very sweet romance.The only previous work I had seen of director Marc Forster was 2005's Stay with Naomi Watts, and his incredible piece de resistance Finding Neverland. Forster has an incredible imagination and a way of creating such a unique world, story and complicated plot but somehow makes it so incredibly watchable. Stay was disturbing and twisted and seemingly so complex and yet you couldn't not watch it and Finding Neverland was beautiful, breathtaking and simple and yet tragic. I think Forster has so much potential in film making and Stranger Than Fiction is no exception. He puts his own vision into the film and you somehow become entangled in it's charm. Sadly I don't think Stranger Than Fiction will walk away with any Academy Awards or even nominations being steam rolled by bigger fish like The Departed but it deserves to be seen because it's subtly brilliant. It does have it's drawbacks. The ending is horrendously tacked on, it's almost a complete turn around from the rest of the film because it ends up being predictable and happy go lucky instead of tragic and ironic the way it should have been. Nonetheless for an intelligent adult film this is the way to go and to see Ferrell finally do something else with himself. 8/10",8,1,2,25 November 2006
The Wrestler," Fans of 'Professional' wrestling have their moment...the movie is glorious for them!!
","When I was a kid I was enchanted with the stars of World Wrestling like Hulk Hogan, Macho Man, and Ultimate Warrior but Professional Wrestling has changed nowadays but is still a huge empire and has legions of fans. What no one would expect is a completely serious dramatic, powerful film, respecting and paying homage to the craft, and the people involved and the fans but that is exactly what Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler does. Now I won't go into full agreement with the raving fans and critics of the film that are talking about what a moving and incredible film it is. While the film is good and entertaining and does certainly have some emotion I wouldn't call it one of the best movies of this year or last for that matter. I'm not sure it even deserves all the award nominations that it is getting. All this being said you can be completely entertained and fans of the Wrestling world will be floored by how this movie portrays their past time which I think has always been considered a joke but this could change everything. Part of this is the story, and the way it is directed, and an even bigger part is the performance by Mickey Rourke.Mickey Rourke plays aging wrestler Randy 'The Ram' Robinson. Of course everyone knows now that this apparently Rourke's rise from the ashes...never knew he was out of the ashes to begin with. Still his performance as alcoholic, washed up, emotionally disturbed wrestler who is clinging on to his youth and the fame he experienced. Rourke looks absolutely amazing for the role. He looks exactly like his character should and you would expect. He literally embodies the washed up wrestler. He is the perfect combination of what you would expect. I'm still not sure he deserves quite the accolades he is receiving but it is a great performance. Now I'm going to get harsh. The accolades and nominations for Marisa Tomei are ludicrous. Her performance as stripper and love interest Cassidy is barely bordering a joke. She spends more time naked than she does acting so I suppose if you're a fan of Marisa Tomei's body then The Wrestler will really impress you, but her actual acting ability in the film is barely existent. I will say that her chemistry with Rourke is pretty good so that does help. If she is his Adrienne (Rocky) then we are in trouble. If you're looking for a worthy female performance look to Evan Rachel Wood who plays Rourke's estranged daughter and does a much better performance. Their relationship is volatile and intense giving her the opportunity to show off some real emotion.I am not all that familiar with Darren Aronofsky's direction style but this still seemed like a different style for him. There was just something very real and heartfelt about the whole overtone of the film. This could really break him into dramatic films and telling a very emotional passionate story and bringing characters to life. It is certainly a far cry from his previous work on The Fountain. The world of Professional Wrestling has a lot of fans under eighteen and this film certainly isn't for them. I think the audience it aims for are the ones who fondly remember the over the top wrestling heroes of yesteryear but regardless a solid drama is hard to come by and Rourke makes his character very watchable and very entertaining. I still stand by my feelings that it doesn't deserve film making awards but it certainly won't disappoint the movie fan. Worth seeing!! 8/10",8,0,1,26 January 2009
Hancock," If it had been anyone but Will Smith I might have walked out
","It's not very often that I can say I agree with professional critics who usually hate films for the sake of hating them but when it comes to Hancock I'm actually blown away by the amount of people that liked it. This was a Will Smith vehicle that was ONLY held together by Will Smith. If it had not been for him this film would surpassed Waterworld as the stinker of the decade. Only Will Smith could pull off a good performance and keep you watching through a dreadful plot, a barely existent story and a hack job of editing that must have left anything that made this film worthwhile on the cutting room floor. They simply left scenes of Will Smith and the biggest explosions and action scenes but didn't bother to connect them with any substance. The supporting cast is barely existent and all eyes have to be on Will Smith because no one else even makes a blip on the radar. The film is a dark comedy with action and the comedy also lies on the shoulders of Smith and he pulls it off decently playing the alcoholic super hero but even Hancock himself gets such a little story to his character. There was really so much there to delve into and they don't scratch the surface sadly.So now I've mentioned him a few times...Will Smith. One of the most talented actors in Hollywood and needless to say Box Office gold and then some. Smith is good in his role as Hancock. I feel his stress at trying to find something more to give the audience with this character but the script just doesn't do it. Given a much better script Smith could have made this character stunning. Jason Bateman's character is as dry as a desert and again I don't blame him, I think the script gives them next to nothing to work with. Bateman is great at humor and probably can pull off drama but he just looks like a zombie and bombs every scene. I barely realized Charlize Theron was in the movie as Bateman's wife and a character with a secret past of her own. Theron looks bored much like Bateman and although she gets some action scenes of her own it doesn't much matter. Her and Smith have decent chemistry opposite each other but her relationship with Bateman is a dud right from the first scene. I doubt, as popular rumor states, that there was chemistry between Smith and Theron because it was like watching paint dry on screen.The action scenes are overblown and try to distract from the fact that there is NO story or plot or character development. This just proves that special effects can't carry a film. Although apparently it can since many seem to enjoy the movie. I wanted so much more...especially from a Will Smith action film having seen him in some really incredible action stories like I Am Legend, I Am Robot, and Independence Day. The film isn't the worst thing I've seen this year but it wouldn't be anything I'd let myself sit through again on purpose. The film is mercifully short, won't disappoint in special effects, a few laughs, and it does feature Will Smith so that is where the 5 points I'm giving it comes from. I suggest watching this with low expectations and maybe you'll come out not feeling so bad but this isn't on par with other films of the summer by any means. 5/10",5,1,3,30 July 2008
Kong: Skull Island," The monster films of the new Millennium continue on the same path
","Set in the same Universe as 2014's Godzilla, it's really interesting to compare the two because they have almost the exact same faults as they do successes. I really wanted Kong: Skull Island to be a near perfectly crafted disaster/Monster film where they gave you characters with backstory that you cared about, a terrific story of survival and incredible special effects. I wanted this to be at least close to what Jurassic Park was. Kong: Skull Island is entertaining enough but it doesn't even deserve to call Jurassic Park a near relative. The concept is great, the special effects are good but the characters are downright drab. You have these fantastic actors with little to no backstory at all and such incredibly low personality. It leaves you feeling definitely empty.Tom Hiddleston takes the lead and I was skeptical of that but he actually looks great and breaks the Loki mould and even his character had potential but again was written with such little pizazz. He's trying to be broody but without any back story, it comes across as very empty. Brie Larson is an Academy Award winning actress and this has to be one of the worst performances I've ever seen. The romance between her Hiddleston is ludicrous with no build up. She constantly looked confused and stares longingly at Hiddleston. It's really a bad performance for a poorly written character. John Goodman, an incredible actor, is given virtually nothing to work with. His character and performance reminded me so much of Bryan Cranston in Godzilla. He is underused and could have carried the film. The single saving grace is John C Reilly who at least gets a back story and has some personality. He might literally be the reason to watch this. He makes a bad script only slightly less bad. The chemistry with the cast isn't terrible but you never to experience any of it. Even Samuel L Jackson seems subdued by the low quality characters. Are they really aiming for nothing more than CGI effects and the monster? Kong looks amazing although Peter Jackson's King Kong was astonishing. Jordan Vogt-Roberts has been plucked from virtual obscurity with only a handful of very indie type projects and now is handed this massive budget. All things considered, the direction and the cinematography isn't the problem here. The film could have been amazing. Instead it is entertaining enough and a decent popcorn flick but there is such little depth to anything. Gareth Edwards who directed Godzilla was fairly fresh faced too. I expect this monster fad will continue and look pretty but never meet the likes of similar epics in days gone by. 7/10",7,1,5,16 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The finale is easily the best in the second trilogy! Nearly a perfect experience.
","This film is so close to being a ten it almost pains me to give it a 9. But then at the same time I hesitated at giving it a 9 because there were some flaws in it that were almost too frustrating to be ignored. However, when you're looking at a film and series of such epic scale you have to look at the big picture. When Peter Jackson undertakes a project of this magnitude there is bound to be some flaws so you have to balance the good and the bad and the truth is I had really enjoyed this. It is however definitive proof that there did not need to be three Hobbit films and I've said that from the beginning. The first film was very good, the second film was average at best. It felt like complete filler...left overs that were slapped together to make another movie. Now having seen the third movie I know that that middle movie was completely unnecessary. The Hunger Games series suffered from the same, splitting Mockingjay into two films simply isn't necessary. Battle of The Five Armies is visually stunning of course with some beautiful and breathtaking scenery. Too much CGI is used once again but that seems to be par for the course now for this series and other blockbuster films. The missing character depth from the second film is returned ten fold and the characters we love are even better. The film runs a little long but that is also something we've come to expect from Jackson's Lord of The Rings films. It builds up to a war you know is coming and it doesn't disappoint when the climax hits.Richard Armitage who was very nearly lost in the shuffle of the second film comes back swinging in a brilliant finale as Thorin. He proves he deserves to be the latest King in the series as he goes from Dragon sickness to the hero he was born to be. Martin Freeman closes out his titular role in an emotional and heroic end. Freeman was a brilliant choice for Bilbo and he's terrific. The group of dwarfs that were nearly pointless in Desolation of Smaug are given back their characters and dignity in this film and you will love all of them (although I still think they are way underdeveloped compared to the original trilogy's characters.) Ken Stott, Graham McTavish, William Kircher, James Nesbitt, Stephen Hunter, Dean O'Gorman, Aiden Turner, John Callen, Peter Hambleton, Jed Brophy, Mark Hadlow and Adam Brown were underdeveloped in the series as a whole BUT they do get their just scenes in the end with especially emotional parts for most of them. Hopefully I didn't forget anyone. Thank goodness, Ian McKellen returns to a more significant role than in the second one (he was probably filming X-Men during the second film.) McKellen is amazing as Gandalf. He's probably the best character to come out of this entire series and he holds the cast together. This was no exception. Orlando Bloom and Evangeline Lilly also return and get much better roles in this one although Bloom is still not as likable as he was in the original trilogy. Lee Pace also gets a more significant and very good role this time around.The cast is massive and its hard to cover everyone but I can say that this was far better character development than Desolation of Smaug. The action starts immediately picking up right where the second film left off and drops you into a final battle and a perfect farewell to this iconic blockbuster series. Truthfully there were times where I thought Battle of The Five Armies simply felt like a remake of Return of The King but maybe that is more of a compliment than a negative comment. It was a climactic ending and while I don't think this trilogy needed to be three films and I also felt as though this one ran a little long, the true brilliance is in the guts behind making such an ambitious project. Jackson has created and set the bar for what we consider modern day epics. This one was a fantastic time at the movies. Bravo and farewell Middle Earth!! 9/10",9,3,7,13 January 2015
Hitch," Intelligent, Fun, and Continuing a great year for films
","I have said in several reviews that the last several months worth of film have been the best I have seen in such a long time and I am anticipating much more. We've had the absolute best of artistic, funny, romantic, and academy worthy films I have seen. Now is the time to watch a good flick. Hitch will not gain any academy awards but people love it and it is such a great romantic comedy. First off you've got Will Smith who is a box office draw and just one of the greatest movie stars of this century. Everything he does is great, whether action or comedy. Kevin James of television fame, who I fully expected to play the same role we see on TV every week surprised me in a big way by playing a heartfelt, anxious, self conscious quiet character who the audience can love.Hitch is the story of a man who has had his heartbroken and eventually turned his life into helping other lovable 'losers' get the women of their dreams. Alex Hitchens is a date doctor. He believes he has the ingredients to winning women over and to set up love so it blossoms. However, he himself guards himself from ever falling in love again. His successful, hidden business has helped men everywhere obtain women otherwise out of their league. Albert Brennaman is a nice guy who is overlooked by the high profile woman of his dreams Allegra Cole, whom he works for. Albert hires Alex and they begin the process of winning her over. Meanwhile Alex begins to fall for a gossip columnist who is searching for a story on the date doctor, not realizing the guy she is falling for is none other than him.Probably the best part of this romantic comedy is in the intelligence. It has a great story, and a very nice message for both men and women. It's not only about stereotypical hot leading man, falling for hot leading lady but rather Joe Average and their pursuit of love and that being yourself can be a good thing and there isn't a specific recipe of love. I'm just not sure that they really focus on that message the whole time because Hitchen's recipe for love DOES work and he does help Albert get noticed even if being himself does work in the end. Nonetheless the film is a nice, intelligent comedy. Smith and James are hilarious together although I don't think director Andy Tennant used Smith and James character enough together and he didn't establish their friendship as much as he could have but they have some great scenes together including Smith watching him dance...HILARIOUS...and their kissing scene among others. The leading ladies did a great job too and the two couples had great on screen chemistry. If you're looking for a funny comedy, or just a nice easy film this is definitely one to check out. It's just great!!! 8.5/10",Null,0,1,7 March 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Rounding out the incredible epic
","So many obstacles and such enormous, HUGE fans to live up to. Lucas had an overpowering amount of obstacles to overcome. But in his favor he took the criticism and just continued on with his dream for the greatest science fiction epic and overall...all six films...he accomplished that and so much more. Episode III finishes off his epic and connects the old with the new. After the disastrous (my opinion) Episode II I didn't think the third installment would rectify the situation any. I had chocked the deplorable performance of Hayden Christenson in Episode II to his bad acting and criticized Lucas for casting such an important role to such a poor actor. I formally retract that statement. Apparently I should blame Lucas for Episode II because Christenson redeems himself for Revenge of The Sith.Revenge of The Sith picks up in the heat of the Clone War. Chancellor Palpatine has been kidnapped by Count Dooku and the separatist army and they are trying to take him away from the capital. Jedi Knights Obi Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are successful in rescuing him and returning him to safety. The Jedi council finds themselves in a power struggle with with Palpatine when he attempts to take power away from them. Palpatine convinces Skywalker that the council is trying to hold him back from being a master, and Palpatine uses Anakin's fear of losing his wife Padme who is pregnant with his child (children as we find out.) Palpatine shows Anakin that he is indeed a powerful user of the Dark Side of the force and Anakin is tricked into turning against the Jedi Council. Palpatine puts his plan into action and uses his troops to systematically wipe out the Jedi and attack the Jedi temple. He also uses Anakin to help wipe them out. When Obi Wan discovers Skywalker's turn to the dark side he tracks him down and fights him to the death. He leaves Anakin for dead but Palpatine, who is none other than Darth Sidious will turn Anakin into the most evil of all Sith Lords, Darth Vader.Nothing is left to small potatoes in this film. Each important event is treated with the most explosive, emotional and drastic moments. Mace Windu's death, the birth of the Twins Luke and Leia, Skywalker's transformation, Padme's death...everything is done with the perfect amount of attention. There are some major plot moving, epic moments in this film and some of them should have been utilized in Episode II in order to save it from boring monotony but they didn't. Instead Lucas held them all for Episode III making it perhaps one of the best of the entire series which is quite an accomplishment to have one of the best be the last in a six part series. Hayden Christensen redeems his awful performance as Anakin in Episode II and shows us a very emotionally torn, confused Jedi who is tempted to the dark side with his fear and emotions. He plays an amazing bad guy and we actually feel him becoming Vader who truly is one of the greatest film bad guys ever. I didn't think he could pull that off and he did!! Ewen McGregor continues to impress as young Obi Wan. You can actually picture him becoming Alec Guinness' Obi Wan of later films, also quite a feat. You just can't help, after growing up with the original films feel completely fulfilled seeing these characters live out their past. It's like reliving history that you were only familiar with by legend in the original films. Natalie Portman is sufficient as Amidala but hasn't really captured what she was in Episode I. She was so passionate and such an interesting strong character and yet gradually she seemed to fade out in the other Episodes. I do think Portman is a great actress but somehow she lost her character throughout the films. It is also an amazing accomplishment for Lucas to create such amazing characters that we relate to that don't exist...I mean of course Master Yoda voiced by Frank Oz and those irreplaceable droids R2-D2 and C3P0...more R2 for this film. R2 plays such an integral role in this film and you just feel so connected to this character that is more of a puppet than anything. I have to give that credit to Lucas. There were some downsides in my mind that kept this from being a perfect film. First off I did find some of the dialog and acting campy at times. Perhaps this was meant to be but with such an epic scale film series campiness doesn't fit in. And I have to say, although it goes with the times that CGI was an unnecessary addition. Knowing that they pulled off the first three amazing films with no CGI makes you realize how much they use. Granted it's used a little better than some films but it's still there and often ruins the feel of the film. Yoda was so digitally done that it was distracting in my opinion. I also must say I was not a fan of the lava planet. It seemed tacked on in order to create a 'cool looking' final battle. I would have also liked to have seen more of a return to some familiar locations like tattooine but this film moved at a very fast pace and rarely took a breather. Overall this was the perfect wrap up to an amazing series. All of them are necessary to each other but it's also nice when they are a great movie. I don't know if Episode III stands the test of classic film like the originals but I know I loved seeing it. 8.5/10",8,2,4,21 June 2005
Ray," Powerful Bio
","I have always loved the music of Ray Charles, but knew nothing of his background, his popularity throughout the sixties and seventies and his life. Ray changed that in a big way. Needless to say Ray is the story of Ray Charles Robinson, the blind performer who sang and played the piano for over four decades. The film chronicles his childhood, and the years rising to the top ending with his final battle with Heroin. This is an incredibly powerful film. The actors casted for the roles in this film are what some might consider 'second string' actors normally known for Television or supporting actor roles. They all absolutely shine in this film. Curtis Armstrong, Richard Schiff, David Krumholtz, and Regina King were just some the faces we see all the time but never quite as brilliantly as in this movie. It seemed as though they were all putting everything into their performances for this movie. The film certainly did not lean towards painting Ray Charles as a hero or a 'good guy' by any means. If anything it leaned the other way although it was also portrayed in such a way that you couldn't help but feel sympathy and struggle for and with him. The film relied heavily not so much on story but rather certain specifics of his life. Mostly it was his womanzing, drug use and the 60's from his beginning in music to when he really broke into mainstream and became famous. The film delved almost too deeply into his womanizing and perhaps didn't touch enough on the effect it may have had on his wife, played brilliantly but sadly underutilized by Kerry Washington in really her first big role. Her character could have been much more used in this movie.For all the IMDb critics who are slamming this movie...well everyone is entitled to their own opinion but this is one powerful film. It doesn't have the best flowing storyline or doesn't wrap things up in the way that perhaps it could have. Often times the jumping from one time period to the next leaves us feeling unfulfilled but the heart is there and that's Ray Charles.The heart of this film is Mr. Jamie Foxx. I failed to mention him until this point because he far transcends this film portraying Ray Charles. Until the film Collateral I would have centered Jamie Foxx out as a typical crude comedian aka Chris Rock etc. His film in Collateral was hard edged, and emotional but no one could prepare for what he was to bring us in this movie. Acting is the ability to convince your audience you are someone else entirely. Making them forget you are actually an actor playing a role makes you the master actor in my opinion. Few if any have ever done that for me until this movie. Jamie Foxx completely becomes Ray Charles. He made me think I was watching Ray Charles grow up, play music, sing, and overcome hardships. He never once missed a beat when it came to lip syncing Charle's songs. His mannerisms and voice were unbeatable. Of course there is the typical Oscar Buzz around this but the truth of the matter is there HAS NOT been and will not be a better performance out there as Jamie Foxx has given in this movie. It's a hands down no choice when it comes to that. The question will remain as to whether or not Foxx is too mainstream for the academy because he is the best...period. The film did not wrap up well, seemingly Taylor Hackford who also directed one of my other favorite films Proof Of Life, threw together an ending in order to wrap up a lonnnnnng story. Nonetheless the film is a must see for this year and anyone who loved Ray Charles will adore this film and anyone who knows little or nothing about him will learn a lot and see one of the best movie performances in the history of movies. See it!! The film I give a very big 8/10!! I must MUST extend that and give Jamie Foxx's performance a HUGE 10/10 as the best performance I have ever seen.",Null,1,2,10 November 2004
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," Setting the bar for animation
","Now I don't want any hate mail (just kidding I do...I love getting emails) but I am scoring this beloved classic a 6. Not because its a bad film, no movie that is considered a stone cold classic and the starting point of one of the biggest film heavyweights in history could be a 'bad' movie but I review my films on entertainment value to me. I could list pros and cons for this film all day and all night because I feel like it has a lengthy list in both columns. On one hand if you look at it from its conception date in the late 1930's, it is brilliant, breathtaking animation. The artistic value on this film is a 20 out of 10. Still today you have to marvel at the beautiful hand drawn art and characters. But you could argue against me until you're blue in the face but I believe this is a movie that could have been told in ten minutes. They drag it out and there is many scenes in the film that are simply too long. Its an extremely dark film (as many of Disney's adventures tend to be) so much so that I personally wouldn't let very young children watch it. And while most of the songs are iconic and lovely, they are far from the best in the Disney animation classic repertoire.Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs created some of the most iconic well known figures in animation history or film history for that matter. Out of all the Disney princesses I have always felt that Adriana Caselotti was the least impressive of the bunch. There are times when her singing voice is almost irritating like sandpaper and her tones are off in various scenes. I don't know why Walt Disney took such a liking to her but she didn't do much else outside of this so I think I may be closer to hitting the nail on the head than you would think. Lucille La Verne is very good as the evil Queen cementing her place in animated villainy quite purposefully. I felt like in this most recent viewing that she was actually almost underused in the film but she does get some terrific and terrifying scenes. Each one of the seven dwarfs are fantastic. They all have such unique (albeit blatantly obvious) personalities. Everyone will find their favourite and while some get more scenes than others, they are terrific. Harry Stockwell as the Prince...well I can't say much of anything about his performance because he is probably the most underused Prince in Disney history. There is no build up to their romance and every scene he is in is very rushed and forced.That is perhaps my biggest issue with the film. So much of it dragged and too much time was spent trying to fill empty void in an effort to make it feature length and then when you hit the climax of her eating the apple...it rushes right through to the end and credits are rolling before you even know what happened. The last ten or fifteen minutes are far too rushed and compact. This film holds its credibility because of what it did for Disney studios and animation and the characters that became so iconic. The six directors that worked on this film deserve most of that credit because it really is a beautiful film to look at. Even the background of each sequence is just lovely. For me, it was a bit of a dud in a few ways but I can appreciate artistic beauty and this film is full of that at the very least. 6/10",6,3,9,1 January 2014
Shooter," Mark Wahlberg proves his action movie chops and succeeds!!
","Shooter was just one of those action films. It won't be a stone cold classic and it won't take home any Academy Awards but you pay your ten bucks, watch explosions, chases, and the intense hero kick some villain ass and you love it and that's exactly what Shooter is and does. Shooter succeeds on so many levels. In many ways Shooter borrows from great action flicks from the past but manages to make those pieces it's own shtick and pull it off. Shooter also has a plot that makes for the best action films...vengeance.Mark Wahlberg has had some great roles in the last few years but this is really the first time I've seen him grab the reigns of leading man and really prove himself and he does that. The film, with a lesser star, might have been mediocre at best but Wahlberg adds significant class to the role. Michael Peña is perfect for supporting actor as Wahlberg's improbable partner. He does a terrific job and is a great action sidekick with a tinge of humor to his performance. Kate Mara is the sexy female lead to Wahlberg's rough and rugged masculine role. She spends her first few moments on screen in a bra and underpants but she still holds her own and makes the role significant enough to warrant mention. Her and Wahlberg have excellent chemistry although their romance is not explored to it's fullest for the sake of the action. Danny Glover, Elias Koteas, and legendary Ned Beatty are the main villains who go to great lengths to set Wahlberg up for the assassination of the President. The three of them are appropriately villainous but considering the amplitude of what the villain does in this film they aren't used as much as they could have been.Shooter almost HAS to be a praised action film because director Antoine Fuqua is no stranger to the genre having directed utter action classics such as Bait, Training Day, and Tears of The Sun. He does know what makes a great action film and that includes a good, strong story and plot and Shooter has that. We are inundated with the history of Wahlberg's character and then get to know him through his decisions and lifestyle. The final showdown has everything that a great action film should have complete with intense explosions, shootout and the bad guy getting his just end. Best of all Shooter is just a kick ass movie that you can sit down and enjoy beginning to end. It's not without it's flaws, I wouldn't say it has quite the staying power of some action films and I admit it is a little forgettable in the long run but for the time I spent in that theater, I loved every minute of it. Check this one out for sure!! 8.5/10",8,1,5,23 April 2007
Bring It On," A guilty pleasure...a comedy, teen classic!! One of my favorites..I admit it
","I don't remember when I first saw Bring It On but I can tell you that since then I've probably seen it 100 times. At one time I might have even told you that this silly, teen, cheerleader romp was a perfect 10 but I have seen it so many times that it has slightly worn thin but not much. Slapstick one liners, cheerleader, valley girl expressions and some rather impressive performances given the genre. There have been many cheerleading movies since, including some decent but, never as good, straight to video sequels, but nothing ever comes close to this film. Some will certainly chastise me and think I am downright crazy for uttering classic around this film, I mean clearly it isn't Gone With The Wind but in it's own genre for what it stands for and what it aims to do it is truly near perfection. The characters are fantastic, the story is an underdog, sports type film but with loads of valley girl teenagers, a silly little romance and plenty of cheerleading stunts. It just has a little bit of everything for a little bit of everyone. Of course there is a key demographic, I think that is pretty clear but anyone who can let loose, put their brain on the back burner can enjoy the film.Teen star Kirsten Dunst headlines the cast just about perfectly. Dunst has always been a decent actor with some very good roles under her belt. However, ironically or not she excels at playing the teen queen role. She also is great at comedy and really lowering her intelligence a little to play her slightly vapid but likable character. Eliza Dushku endeared herself to me as the twisted Faith in Buffy but truthfully her characters never really stray too far from one type and this role wasn't really any different. Still she is great as the tough as nails Missy and her and Dunst are so different and yet make a great pair. Jesse Bradford is also great as Dushku's brother and Dunst's love interest. He has a great knack for comedy and has the quality of being very down to earth. His chemistry is perfect with both girls in their respective roles. The supporting cast just really adds such a great level to the film. They all have such hilarious, great roles and some of the best performances are given by Gabrielle Union, Clare Kramer, Nathan West, Huntley Ritter, Richard Hillman with an absolutely hilarious small little cameo by Ian Roberts as a hired dance instructor.Director Peyton Reed seems to have really come a long way since even this film. Still this was really a break through for his directing. Something about his style really works for bringing this cast together and making the most of it. Somehow Bring It On exceeds the typical teen genre. I don't mean to imply that this film is some feat of film making but it just has this timeless, campy, comedic feel. If you're a teenager or love comedy and you can truly let your brain go for a couple hours this is one that is worth it all the way!! 8.5/10",8,0,0,29 March 2009
Inception," The best science fiction film ever made? One of the top five movies I have ever seen? 2010 finds its all time great.
","It was about fifteen minutes in to this film thought I thought...man...this might be a 10/10 and it has been a LONNNG time since I scored a 10/10 on a film. By the middle of the film I couldn't even think about a score because my brain was being melted and twisted and I was sitting in the theatre with my mouth gaping open and drool probably coming from my chin. Inception is a mind bending, mind blowing, twisting, thrilling, brilliant, freakish, captivating ride of a film. You WILL NOT find a better movie this entire summer to date and is very unlikely you will find a better film the rest of the summer or year likely. You need to understand that for me (I know there will be many many arguments over this) this was instantly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Never mind the fact that apparently little to no CGI was used in the film was enough to impress given that the action scenes, the stunning cinematography, the brilliant special effects are some of the best in this history of film. The brutal, breath taking, and stunning zero gravity 'hallway' fight puts ANY fight scene to a back seat and to shame.Leonardo DiCaprio is obviously one of the biggest stars in the world. He is also one of the smartest stars because he is very choosy about his roles. Consider his success and level of artistic choices since the massive film success of Titanic. His level of intensity, screen chemistry, and simple stardom is in full swing in Inception. He carries the film like an absolute pro and he is perfect in his performance and absolutely deserves Academy attention. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is gradually proving what I have said about him for some time and that he is incredibly talented and has a truly awe inspiring performance in front of him. Inception will certainly help that! His character and performance is a little less outstanding as DiCaprio and is definitely a supporting character but he still has some incredible moments including the aforementioned 'hallway' battle scene. Ellen Page is terrific as the young architect on the team. She still gives off the Juno vibe and I hope she can work to break that but her and DiCaprio have great chemistry as partners and she is a welcome addition to the cast. Tom Hardy has some good scenes but certainly takes a back seat in the cast to the main characters. I think I would have liked to have learnt more about his character but he is secondary to the cast. Ken Watanabe gives a solid remarkable performance as the cut throat businessman holding DiCaprio's life in his hands. Despite also being supporting his performance is stronger than some of the others but regardless they are an ensemble team and cast. Cillian Murphy gives nothing short of the performance of his career as far as I'm concerned as the target of their 'inception' Robert Fischer. Murphy is supporting as well but really gives a solid, convincing and intense performance. For the main cast the final performance is also award worthy I think. Marion Cotillard plays DiCaprio's late wife Mal. She is part villain, part heroine, and part romantic interest and balances her multi-faceted character flawlessly. The characters that play small cameos but really an amazing job include Tom Berenger (really top notch), Pete Postlethwaite (ADORE this guy), and the amazing Michael Caine in a sadly small role the is literally a blink of the eye.After the success of The Dark Knight (even though I believed it to be a little bit over-hyped) no one doubts director Chris Nolan's talent but Inception is a whole different ball game. This film is brilliant, this film captivates a whole new world of Science Fiction, thriller and action. I wanted to watch it again as the first of the credits began. While the story is intensely complex and I couldn't take my eyes off of the screen for a single second, it wasn't hard to follow. It doesn't get muddled and somehow (brilliantly) every step makes sense and as much as it hurts your brain you can follow every single move throughout the movie as they essentially go down FIVE levels of a person's subconscious dream level. If I heralded this film too much...you're wrong its not enough for a film that should easily take nominations for Best Picture, Score, cinematography, actor, supporting actor, screenplay...I'm sure there is more. You DO NOT want to miss the best film of the year and the newest addition to at least the list of top five movies I have ever seen. 10/10 (standing ovation here)",10,2,11,23 July 2010
Lord of War," Remarkable potential left slightly under utilized
","Lord of War is a rather interesting film about an arms dealer named Yuri Orlov. I have never seen a film like this, it's unique and such an interesting concept. There is no 'good guy,' only a sort of mock-umentary which feels so real about a horrible human being who is an arms dealer from the beginning of his career and creation forward. The story and scenes are disturbing and very moving and yet amidst all this I think Lord Of War could have been downright brilliant, but was not made to it's full potential.All right it's true for some odd reason I can't bring myself to fully like or appreciate star Nicholas Cage. So, so many of his films I have loved and yet I find him sub-par in the acting genre. I think he's brilliant at choosing the right scripts but I find his acting range very limited. Although he was adequate as the Lord of War himself Orlov, I think someone...I don't know who...could have really done some Oscar worthy performing out of the character. Still Cage is watchable and he does do a pretty good job at showing a complete and utter lack of compassion for the people he sells these weapons to. Bridget Moynahan plays Orlov's soul mate, dream girl and wife Ava Fontaine Orlov. Despite her slightly smaller role she does a great job as being completely naive to her husband's business. Jared Leto is truly the stand out performance in this film as Yuri's strung out, seriously misguided brother Vitaly Orlov. Every scene is different for his character and for him and despite also having a small role he makes the best of every scene and is absolutely the scene stealer. I suppose it might be worth mentioned that Ethan Hawke plays Orlov's adversary Jack Valentine desperately trying to capture and bring down the arms dealer to no avail or success. His role is small and he doesn't really do anything spectacular with the role. In fact he's almost too aggressive and you never really feel the intensity between the two men the way I think you should have.The problem with the film that stops it from being completely brilliant is not that the cast is bad by any means but that they are just simply adequate. They aren't brilliant and that holds back what this film could have been. It's truly a remarkable bio about an arms dealer, a side of the world we rarely see in film or otherwise. This is a man who started out just wanting to make a mark on the world and literally ends up losing his soul. You see a complete lack of caring in his eyes and although he only kills one man barely by his own will he is moved and terrified by it but turns a blind eye to others doing it. Andrew Niccol does set up a terrific film but it simply falls short of full potential due to the sub standard cast and it just feels like not enough heart, time or effort was put into it...it's unfortunate but still interesting enough to make it worth while. 7/10",7,1,2,14 April 2006
Sherlock Holmes," Fast and full of action...if nothing else it breathes new life into an old classic
","Some say there is no originality left in Hollywood. Sherlock Holmes is about as far from original material as you can get given there are probably hundreds of Sherlock Holmes films and TV Episodes and yet could anyone other than Hollywood put together a completely new spin on an age old idea. And this is building Sherlock Holmes from the ground up into a completely new genre and franchise. There was already a lot of hype around the film when I got to seeing it. Mostly the people around me raved about it as a terrific action flick and they weren't wrong but I think the film wasn't quite the masterpiece some made it out to me. I mean ultimately it was the age old idea with the same action genre ingredients mixed in. Even bringing on a director with flare and style (although I've never seen a film of his) didn't change the fact that there was nothing particularly outstanding about the way the film was made. Nonetheless sometimes, even most times, a movie is just about having fun and Sherlock Holmes is exactly that. Terrific cast, solid action, great humour, and just simply a fun romp.Robert Downey Jr. has always been a respected actor but as of late, especially since Iron Man he is a Hollywood star of the highest calibre. As the infamous Sherlock Holmes he is funny, neurotic, brilliant, and as always ignites the screen and is always watchable. If anything he has brought Sherlock Holmes into a new generation. No one else could have played him like this. I wasn't sure about Jude Law playing the world famous sidekick Dr. Watson. I've always see Law as having a bit of an ego and I didn't think he could tone that down to play second fiddle to Downey Jr.'s character. I was wrong in every way. Law is amazing as Watson and the two of them have amazing chemistry which is a necessity to this team. The two of them together are funny, and eccentric and just awesome. Their banter and co-operation is just fun. I enjoy Rachel McAdams, she's a versatile actor and beautiful but unfortunately as Sherlock's love interest and a vivacious thief she is very underused. I think her character could be fascinating and her and Downey have the hint of solid chemistry but they aren't given the chance to really get down to it. I hope she returns for the series and they utilize her more with Downey. Mark Strong is solid as the evil mysterious villain Lord Blackwood. He isn't the best foe I could have imagined and his performance doesn't quite match that of Downey or Law but he is decent. I am more on the edge of my seat to see Moriarity materialize.As I said I have not seen a Guy Ritchie film but I've heard of his unique and strong indy style from previous films. I think what he brought to Sherlock Holmes was a strong feeling of updating the character and yet still keeping the main ideas in tact. Holmes is still brilliant, he can decipher just about anything and is incredible intuitive but this Sherlock can also break bones and hold his own in a scrap. Nowadays a great hero needs more than just brains and clearly Ritchie and the rest of the film makers got that memo loud and clear. Sherlock Holmes (although opening on Christmas) jumps starts a solid year in 2010 of great entertaining movies. You can see the film and have fun and not have to wonder if it's critically acclaimed or whether it will walk away with awards. It's a feel good, fun time, and while it has it's share of violence and a little sexual innuendos the language was completely clean which is surprising and welcome. Go see Sherlock Holmes because it's well worth seeing on the big screen. It might not be mind blowing but it's the beginning of a great franchise. 8/10",8,0,0,17 January 2010
WALL·E," An artistic feat of Animation that will become an absolute legendary classic!!
","I wanted to see Wall-E from the minute I saw the trailers. I thought he looked adorable and the film looked cute and then the reviews said it was kind of dark and very little dialog and finally I got to see it. I was moved, blown away, excited by it, cheering for it...I fell head over heels for Wall-E and it's completely original and touching love story. Essentially I believe Wall-E is indeed a love story...both between two completely different robot entities and between a robot and his world. The animation is brilliant from the completely obliterated world of earth to the enormous futuristic ship and the adventure is non stop fun!! Despite some reviewers opinions of the film being too dark and too preachy for kids I think its a case of over analyzing because the film is fun and cute as it is serious. Yes the film does have a strong message but it is still told in animation for anyone and everyone to enjoy and the story is still happily ever after in the end. The amazing thing is the film makers really make this relationship between Wall-E and Eve so strong and so powerful and so cute that you will feel a romance between two robots. Something only Disney could do...or Pixar in this case.Ben Burtt and Elissa Knight are just brilliant as the voices of Wall-E and Eve respectively. Knight's pleading voice twirping 'Walll-Eee' will forever be a classic moment in animated films. Burtt makes Wall-E come to life and however digitized the voice may be he still gives the character depth and soul. Jeff Garlin is terrific as the overweight Captain who fights the system to save his people. Fred Willard is a great comedian but I found his performance a little monotone in the film and misplaced considering his part. Pixar favorite John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy (Peggy Hill) are residents John and Mary and although they have small roles they are really great in their roles.Wall-E has been heralded with great reviews and numerous award nominations and I think is sure to walk away with an Animated Academy Award at the very least and it is completely well deserved. In classic Pixar style the film can be completely enjoyed by adults and children the same. Considering the first 30-45 minutes is Wall-E exploring the barren earth and setting up his character you will love every minute of it. You will be enthralled with Wall-E and the movie right from the very beginning. He is a subtle hero of the utmost. Pixar director Andrew Stanton has had his hand in at least six of the most popular animated films of the last decade including Toy Story one and two...which I think was a stepping stone in the current level of animation we see now. Wall-E is a feat of animation and will be a new bar of standards to future Pixar animations as well as other companies. An absolute must see for everyone. 9.5/10",9,1,3,15 January 2009
The Good Shepherd," A little confusing but the cast makes it all worthwhile
","The Good Shepherd is downright disturbing. It's a dream film for a conspiracy theorist because it basically shows and implies that for years the Intelligence Community ran this country and did whatever it wanted whenever it wanted. It fulfills every spy fantasy that you can think of complete with code words, secret messages, and assassinations. The whole thing is nicely wrapped into a feel of being realistic and true to life especially since it is loosely 'based' on real life. We are shown the birth of the CIA through the eyes of one particular man from the early days of his career where he is recruited for intelligence. Anyone who loves spy films won't be able to help themselves for this one because it has everything and on top of that the cast is outstanding.Matt Damon leads the cast as Edward Wilson, a Yale Graduate, and brilliant young man is recruited to a Secret Intelligence community eventually to become the Central Intelligence Agency. Damon is strong, quiet, moralistic, and has an incredible character arc throughout the course of the film. He ages well over 20 years throughout the film and pulls it off flawlessly without ever having to look the part. He does so much with this character and I think he was overlooked for Academy Award nominations in this role. Angelina Jolie plays Damon's wife who is pushed aside for his career. Jolie has a small but very definitive role and does a great job. Her and Damon are good together for being 'not good' together. The rest of the cast are mostly smaller supporting roles but they make the bulk of what makes this movie worth seeing. Alec Baldwin is F.B.I. agent Sam Murach, a constant connection for Damon's character throughout the film. Baldwin has a screen presence and he always ups the ante and does a good job. Director Robert De Niro also plays a small but important role as terminally ill General Bill Sullivan who is basically charged with forming these intelligence groups that Damon is brought in on. Not much can be said about De Niro except he's brilliant and powerful on screen and a small role is no exception. Other supporting characters that really do make a difference are William Hurt, Billy Crudup, and Joe Pesci.De Niro might not be a skilled director, this only being his second role as director but he skillfully creates this man's story over the course of two or three decades and gives us an inside look to the intelligence community. The Good Shepherd might even be considered hyper intelligent and you'd likely have to watch it several times before you really understood the entire plot because it does get lost in it's hefty time frame but ultimately it's about the birth of the CIA and it definitely accomplishes that. Anyone wanting something intelligent and full of spy games and a true story The Good Shepherd will be perfect for you. Well worth seeing!! 8/10",8,1,1,5 February 2007
The Blind Side," A lot over hyped but still delightfully sweet and a touchdown for Bullock
","No one seems to make mention of the fact that Ms. Sandra Bullock, former America's sweetheart has been in a slump...a major slump going back as far as 2000 when Miss Congeniality tore up the screen. 2009 was absolutely her glorious comeback with the clever and fun 'The Proposal' and this, which will likely be considered her greatest role of her career. This film is her Eric Brockovich. Is that an overstatement? Yes. Is the film brilliant? No. Its not even particularly unique but what it is is fun, heart warming, touching, fun, entertaining, sad and based on a truth...all making it incredibly popular and it would seem as though it has caught on like wildfire. I think the true charm of The Blind Side is that it can appeal to absolutely everyone. Male and female, young and old, children, families and adults. Everyone will find something to relate to in this film. It touches all the right chords and has a really great and charismatic cast that all work wonderful together. If you walk out of this film with dry eyes I doubt you have a heart. Its a rarity for critics and the film viewing public to both see eye to eye when it comes to an emotional sweet film so all power goes to The Blind Side.As mentioned Sandra Bullock leads the cast as headstrong southern woman Leigh Anne Tuohy. Having seen the real Leigh Anne in interviews I can say that Bullock nails the character. She is an outspoken and strong and you just can't take your eyes off this performance, precisely why she is now looking at an Oscar nomination. Honestly I think that the Academy felt nominating a people's favorite would make the awards popular again but either way Bullock deserves praise for a solid role. If I hadn't seen Tim McGraw in an interview I would condemn him slightly for taking a back seat compared to everyone else in the cast. McGraw is a good actor and could easily hold his own in the film and he's a pleasure to watch but he just isn't front and center but as he said that was exactly the intention because the forefront characters need to be Bullock and Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher. Aaron gives a powerful performance. He's quiet and somber and his entire character is just incredibly touching. If anyone could bring this story to life with emotion Aaron has done it. Jae Head and Lily Collins are terrific supporting members of the cast as the Tuohy children. I think this will do some amazing things for both of their young careers.Director and writer John Lee Hancock hasn't really had enormous success but having seen a couple of his previous films he has a passion and perhaps this is finally reflective of that passion. He clearly got an incredible cast to work with. On the surface the film really isn't anything groundbreaking. An inspirational sports story? A story about a loving family that takes in a troubled youth? A strong woman fighting for what she believes in? You could likely name a few dozen films easily that encompass this plot. But the heart within the film shines through. The true story will melt your heart and if you get the opportunity to see any of the real people from this story you'll understand just where all that heart comes from. Some critics and reviewers and things you will hear will make The Blind Side sound like the most brilliant film of the year and I would never go that far but it is incredibly entertaining and just very lovely. Definitely worthwhile and sure to please millions and millions of fans as it has already done. A must see!! The perfect family film or for anyone and everyone who likes to be moved by a movie. 9/10",9,0,1,1 March 2010
Rango," Funny, quirky, raunchy and more for adults that wanna have fun than kids
","Great animation is a dime a dozen these days. Its hard to find an animated film that isn't good or at least passable. Animation has become a driving force in Hollywood and by no means is it just kids anymore. Rango looked fun and unique and had a western spin so I looked forward to seeing it. It turns in a terrific adventure great character and most of all a slightly adult spin on the animation docket. A lot of animated films nowadays try to subtly work in some adult humour like Shrek or certain Pixar films but Rango doesn't try and hide it. Sure it might go over the heads of some youngsters but I'm not sure I would take my youngster to this one given some of the scenes that are definitely very funny but not kid oriented. The best thing in the film are the characters who are downright amazing including, of course, Rango himself. The story and the adventure are well made although a little slow at times. It certainly doesn't have your typical hour and twenty minutes animated film quality coming in at nearly two hours. As is often the case in animated films the supporting cast are amazing and so much fun to watch and they use them perfectly.Johnny Depp is already one of the most versatile and biggest actors in Hollywood but he was born to be Rango or the other way around. He is perfect as the big talking, lovable little lizard. I am not a fan of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but the scene where Rango splats onto the car of Johnny Depp's character was hilarious. Depp brings him to life in his trademark boisterous personality. Isla Fisher gives an equally boisterous and fun vocal performance as Beans. She might be the only character I thought they underused just a little because she was a ton of fun and does a great job. Who does animated villain better than Ned Beatty? His work in Toy Story 3 will remain one of the best villains in history to me. He does a great job as the mayor. Alfred Molina, Bill Nighy, Stephen Root, and Harry Dean Stanton all deserve honourable mention as they bring their perspective characters to life. Root is hilarious and amazingly fun as several characters but best as the Doc. Probably my favourite part of the film is when Rango goes to find the Spirit of The West who of course is a carbon copy of the one and only Clint Eastwood (though they never say that of course.) The Spirit of the West if played by Timothy Olyphant who I love as an actor and he sounds amazing in the role. It still would have made my day...in fact might have even bumped this up to a nine for me if they had gotten Clint Eastwood himself to do the voice. Still it was fun to see the character.Pirates director Gore Verbinski who is definitely quickly becoming one of the biggest directors out there helms something a little different for him. He still shows off his style of adventure in this film and he clearly knows how to tell a great story and pick amazing talent because Rango is exactly that. One of the things I just loved about Rango is that it has some of the great, memorable, silly lines in any animated film I've seen in a very long time. 'I'm going to slice your face off and use it to wash my unmentionables.' 'You've got something in your eye...' The Bird has a huge arrow sticking out of it. 'Oh, that? That's conjunctivitis. It's hereditary.' and my favourite all time silly ridiculous line...'I once found a human spine in my fecal matter.' Seriously dozens and dozens of hilarious, slightly inappropriate lines delivered perfectly. The film has some minor bad language 'hells' and 'damns' if you will. And definitely has some scary moments but if you are an adult that loves animated you MUST see Rango. Maybe steer clear of showing it the youngsters and keep it between you and the older kids because it is just an all around fun adventure!! 8.5/10",Null,0,0,20 August 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Absolutely the best artistic film of the year thus far
","I can think of a hundred people who would go see Birdman and walk out thinking it was utter crap. It is definitely not for everyone. It is bizarre, artistic, in your face and it takes a certain cinematic knowledge and experience to appreciate how the film is shot and camera angles and intelligent story points. I'm not implying that anyone who doesn't like this film is dumb...I struggled myself sometimes to appreciate the cinematic artistry behind the story. The thing that Birdman has going for it is that its extremely well acted, fascinated, bizarre in a good way and fun to watch. So even if you don't care for all that 'how it was made' stuff you might still enjoy watching something a little different. Its a very, very dark comedy and completely different than what I expected. It is a surrealist satire, a play within a movie within a play in a guy's mind. Its about acceptance and being yourself and dealing with fame and ego. Its the type of film I would love to sit and discuss with film students and as I've said about a few other movies, I think a film school could do an entire class based on this film alone. Its completely understandable why critics have latched onto this film. Every year or two you get one truly unique film out of Hollywood and Birdman is exactly that.I adore Michael Keaton. I've always been a big fan of his. I was excited to see him get back to leading man status. This is a tour de force performance. He is twisted and really disturbed and desperately trying to hold onto reality and life. You watch him in this struggle to maintain his sanity and you began to get lost in what is real and what's in his mind. He is eccentric and hyper and just commands the screen. Not to be outdone Edward Norton returns to a more leading role in a big way as the pompous and loud Broadway star Mike. Norton is amazing. His scenes with and opposite Keaton are absolutely amazing. This is Norton's best performance in years and he has had some great ones. Naomi Watts is also very good (her second great performance I've seen her in lately after St. Vincent) She plays the struggling actress very well and her scenes with Norton are really great. Emma Stone gives a very different performance as Keaton's wild-child daughter. She is very good although it felt weird seeing her in that type of role. Zach Galifianakis actually pulls off not being completely ridiculous as Keaton's lawyer and best friend. He definitely plays the part for laughs but he fits into the tone of the movie which I was surprised about.The cast is very good together...definitely an ensemble cast. It really is like watching a play on stage where everyone feeds off of each other. The single camera angle that follows Keaton around is a brilliant movie by director Alejandro González Iñárritu. Not only do you feel like you are right in step with Keaton but you feel like you're on stage, back stage, an integral part of the scenes unfolding. You feel the energy and the film is definitely high energy. Its almost exhausting watching it. I don't know how else to explain it. It is complex in so many ways and yet simple enough if you don't try and analyze it too much but how can you not? There are so many questions and bizarre moments and 'wait a second...' type emotions you'll feel. It really is watching a break in sanity and all the while it actually makes you question your own ego and your own humanity and mortality...yah its that deep. So all in all its definitely not for everyone and I'm not sure I would watch it again, certainly not for an entertainment purpose but I also would completely understand if it took home film awards this season because it is unique, very well made and fascinating to watch. 8.5/10",8,3,9,23 December 2014
The Conjuring," A solid scarer that will leave any horror fan satisfied
","A few months ago I decided to do my very best to steer clear of trailers. I was simply finding that they were ruining movies for me. So I am proud to say that I didn't see a single trailer for The Conjuring. However, word of mouth was strong on this one. I had heard nothing but terrific things about this and how incredibly scary it was. By the time I went to see it my anticipation was very high. The Conjuring delivers exactly what you would expect. It absolutely met my expectations and satisfied me nearly completely. That being said it did nothing to exceed my expectations and it isn't the best horror flick I've seen (that honour goes squarely to the Evil Dead remake.) It also wasn't nearly as good as Insidious which was far creepier but it was still excellently crafted, well told, well acted and entertaining. There were also some genuinely creepy moments though I felt like it didn't really push my limits. The Conjuring has one significant flaw that held it back in my opinion and that was that it was predictable and cookie cutter and re-hashed material we have seen before in similar 'exorcism' type stories including Insidious. However, don't get me wrong because that did not make it less entertaining, it just stopped it from truly outstanding.I really like Patrick Wilson. I have enjoyed his Television work and the movies I have seen of his. He has a subtle quality about his performances that make him seem down to earth and very relate-able. His performance in this film is captivating and he leads the cast well. He is believable and commanding in his role. Not to be outdone Vera Farmiga is also very good. The two of them together are very good and have great chemistry. They are captivating as the husband and wife paranormal investigators. Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor are the devoted couple whose family is being terrorized by spirits in their new home. Both are good but certainly supporting actors compared to Wilson and Farmiga. Still as the desperate parents they fit the roles very well. Their daughters are played by Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver. They are all very good in the role but none of them really stand out either. The cast all work so well together and everyone fits their roles perfectly. Wilson and Farmiga are the focus and everyone else supports them and it works.I have no doubt that James Wan is a brilliant horror director. I am basing that off the brilliance of the Saw series as a whole and Insidious and now this. He has a desire to tell a good solid story and still scare you. I think he is easily impressionable from horror films he loves and it translates well into his stories. The entire idea of the room of haunted items was really well done and the doll was downright disturbing. The problem is that everything felt a little been there and done that. It was like watching a great exorcism movie but one that you have seen before. Regardless of that though horror fans will thoroughly enjoy this and it is a great ghost story/possession movie that you won't be disappointed with. 8/10",8,0,2,4 August 2013
Scream," The brilliant second coming of the slasher flicks
","There is no doubt that Wes Craven's Scream gave a solid re-birth to the slasher genre. In an age when Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street sequels had left even the most avid fans like myself kind of drained Scream came along and somehow added its own special twist. Sure it had a lot of the same ingredients but instead it took to poking fun of the generic slasher while still creating a very real one and leaving the pieces everyone loved in tact. Another thing Scream does is that it adds a human element to the horror slasher genre. The killer isn't supernatural in any way and is in fact a serial killer with a motive, and a mystery to be unraveled with a 'everybody's a suspect' type game being played. Despite the lack of supernatural 'Ghostface' easily became synonymous with other legendary hacker greats. Scream also doesn't particularly go out of its way to showcase unique and strange deaths like say Friday the 13th where there has been so many that they need to have smart deaths, Scream is about 'Ghostface' stabbing his way through everyone in his way. One thing was for sure...Scream was only the beginning.Neve Campbell was in the height of her Party of Five days and was easily the next 'It' girl although that never truly happened. Scream could also be nailed for bringing together a hot young Hollywood A-List or future A-List cast. Campbell is really the perfect scream queen lead role. She IS the embodiment of what Jamie Lee Curtis was for Halloween or Heather Langenkamp was for Nightmare on Elm Street. Sweet, smart, disturbed, haunted, a twisted past of sorts, Campbell is perfect. She is the girl next door but has a hero inside too. Courtney Cox Arquette (before she was Arquette) plays sleazy ambulance chasing reporter Gail Weathers, that really does have a heart of gold. This is almost a more serious role for Cox although her clumsy silly side shows through a little bit. David Arquette (her now husband) plays lovable loser Dewey. This is a great role for Arquette...defining in many ways. He is an everyman's hero, and despite his nerd like exterior, gets the girl, the bad guy, and goes out guns blazing. This is easily his best role but that isn't saying much really. Jamie Kennedy takes a step back from slapstick to play the smart, level headed movie buff Randy who pines for Sydney. I love Kennedy's character in this film and subsequent Scream films and I only wish he had a bigger role in the first installment. He is comedic relief but in a subtle way and a hero in other ways. Matthew Lillard and Skeet Ulrich I put together as sort of second string supporting characters. Neither of them really have a lead role but their presence is well known in the cast. Both are decent although I felt like Lillard's character lost some credibility at his sort of silly outbursts towards the end. He was one comedian in the film that seemed to be unable to let go of his slapstick antics. Also worth mentioning is a great cameo however brief by Henry Winkler, and the iconic opening scene featuring Drew Barrymore who does an outstanding job being terrorized. They also introduce Liev Schrieber in a small role that will become far more significant in the future.Wes Craven really single handedly brought the slasher genre back to reality. He put together an incredible cast with incredible chemistry that would hold together through 3 (soon to be 4? films.) The first Scream feels like an introduction to a bigger picture which as we know by the end of the trilogy is exactly true. Essentially especially for Campbell, Arquette and Cox Arquette he gave them what would be defining roles for them. Scream also coined defining iconic moments like Ghostface and 'Do you like Scary Movies?' and 'Hello Sydney.' For horror buffs this is classic at its best. It is easily a must see film and is sure to delight, fright and even make you smile. 8.5/10",8,0,1,9 April 2010
Never Back Down," A next Generation Karate Kid for the sassier youth of today, an entertaining movie!
","Certainly Never Back Down will never take home any film making accolades but if the idea was to entertain it does that and does it solidly. There are the obvious comparisons to Karate Kid for those of us who grew up the classic eighties series but ultimately Never Back Down has only one message or moral...Never....Back...Down...and I'm not sure it's all that much of a moral really. So it doesn't quite have the life lessons that Karate Kid bestowed to us. I think Never Back Down was made to entertain and show off hot bodies, cool locations, and some kick ass fighting techniques for the latest fighting crazy, that being Ultimate Fighting or mixed martial arts or whatever you want to call it. The choreography for the fight scenes is intense and definitely makes you cringe to watch them get hit and beat to a pulp. Still the whole Rocky, Karate Kid type genre recipe is there in full force. Kid rough around the edges meets his match, meets the girl, trains with the best, comes back to kick the mean guys butt. But hey I think that genre is not done to the degree of decency that it used to be in the eighties so I quite enjoyed Never Back Down. One of the truly unique things about the film is that even though much of it might be seen as a little materialistic, shallow even...the characters have a surprised amount of depth.Sean Faris, looking strikingly like a young Tom Cruise, plays Jake Tyler. He's a brawler new to the area that gets caught up with the wrong people at the wrong time. Faris is terrific and really lights up the screen and to echo some other reviewers on IMDb I think this will be his break out role. He does a really good job in this role. Despite the film being about no holds barred brawling, there is some serious emotion here to his character about his past and his father and you do really get attached to the character. Amber Heard is just...well...she's drop dead sexy as the new object of Jake's affection Baja Miller. She is the stereotypical eye candy and they use her as such throughout the film shamelessly having her show up in a bikini or low cut top BUT they actually use her as a character too!! Her character goes through some big changes in the film and her and Faris are electric together and really make a great team. She's talented and hot so bonus for this film because they were able to use her as more than just eye candy. Cam Gigandet I had already come to despise (but in a good way) as Volchok on The O.C. but he was the perfect bad guy in Never Back Down. He just has this smarmy, sleazy tough guy bad boy thing going on and he was the perfect adversary to Faris' good guy. I hope this opens up some roles for him as well. Evan Peters is a good addition to the cast as Faris' new found best friend Max. I wouldn't say he was quite as strong an actor as the rest of them but he fit in well as comic relief and as an underdog sidekick type character. In a small role Leslie Hope is terrific as Faris' mother who is suffering from depression and struggling for her family. She really is great in a small role. Wyatt Smith also does a decent job as Faris' little brother. And finally Academy Award nominated actor Djimon Hounsou is brilliant as the tough as nails fighting instructor Jean Roqua who tries to tame Jake's wild skills. He's not quite as profound as Mr. Myagi or quite as determined as Mickey (from Rocky) but he's still an amazing actor and presence and definitely does a great job in the role. He has good chemistry with Faris as well and gets his own sub plot that helps his character.The story could be described as predictable perhaps but the characters are really well done which is impressive. And the fighting style is different from most films so it keeps you riveted. Director Jeff Wadlow is fairly new to the big screen although I thought he did very well directing the slasher flick Cry Wolf (see my review.) This proves he is a versatile director who can really tell a story and that's exactly what Never Back Down does. Not only is there the surface story about the brawling but actual sub plots from Jake's character to Roqua's story and even Jake's family. I think this might be one of the best predictable stories I've ever seen. It's well worth seeing...I think it's unique and very entertaining!! Check it out. 8.5/10",8,1,3,25 March 2008
Halloween," A masterpiece.
","What else can I say? John Carpenter's Halloween is a piece of masterful art. It defined horror and slasher films. It defined and revolutionized low budget movie making. It is the patriarch to an entire genre and it is a film I love deeply. It literally kick started my love for the horror genre and it is THEE bar for which everything else is judged. What makes this film so brilliant? Outside of the fact that it is truly terrifying and gets under your skin...when you break down and analyze the film you will literally be floored by it. If you have not seen this movie, you need to sit down, pop some popcorn, turn out all your lights and watch what is easily one of the great films of its genre if not in film history. You have to put the movie into perspective too. John Carpenter was a nobody (if I'm not mistaken?) Jamie Lee Curtis was plucked at random because she was not a star, the film was made on a shoestring budget and yet every single piece falls into place. The haunting setting of Halloween and the small Illinois town that is a snapshot of Americana, the back story of the mysterious murderous young boy and his escape, the obsessed doctor in a Victor Von Frankenstein type role chasing down the monster he spent years trying to keep locked up. The dialogue works so well and even when its being cheesy, it works for those characters. Then you have John Carpenter's masterful brilliant direction. This film has at least three of my all time favourite movie scenes. I won't say what they are but they give me chills when I see them.I have always enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress, I think she's amazing and a legend in her own right but this is where it all began. She is absolute perfect as the virginal and innocent Laurie Strode. We have no real background on her character yet but as the ultimate (seemingly random) victim of an insane killer she defines scream queen. When I hear that term...I think of her. And she's not without fortitude. She is tough as nails while being absolutely terrified. She fights to the death when put in a survive or be killed situation. Donald Pleasance is already a legend but he adds such instant class and gravitas to the film as Dr. Loomis. He has two or three speeches that are stirring and literally tell the entire story whether setting up the scene or making you feel like you understand Michael Myers. Honestly, everyone else is sort of fodder for Myers. However, they each have very important roles to play and they do their roles well. They leave you with a lasting impression and the film wouldn't be the same without them period! Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles and John Michael Graham (gets one of the great horror scenes ever...one of those aforementioned scenes that give me chills), all play the wild and crazy friends of Laurie's that are systematically picked off. Charles Cyphers has a small but very good role as Kyes' father and the local sheriff. His best scenes are opposite Pleasance. Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are really terrific as the two little kids who are under Laurie's care when Myers attacks. They deliver their lines a little stiffly but for being who they are, they are great!! Nick Castle inadvertently I think creates one of the most powerful and formidable horror villains in history. His stoic and terrifyingly powerful portrayal of Michael Myers must be seen to be believed. Yes he is somewhat comparable to Jason Voorhees (or the other way around) but there is an implied intelligence, brute strength and most importantly unstoppable and unexplainable desire to kill in his simple performance. That mask will forever haunt me.For whatever reason John Carpenter had this innate talent inside him to take a simple concept and what little money he had and make it a mountain. He made the most effective horror film to date using lighting and characters and back story. There are things hidden in this film (or maybe its total coincidence) but every time I watch it I wonder what it means in the bigger picture. To make a simple slasher picture and give it depth and meaning and make you think about it is an impressive feat and he will always be a horror god to me. The rest of the series ranged from terrible to almost as good as this one but that doesn't change the fact that how it all started is a reason to watch horror. It seems like all the right pieces fell into place for this classic and I will continue to watch it at least once every year to remind myself what amazing horror is truly about. 10/10",10,0,3,11 November 2014
Despicable Me," Ahhh I get it!
","I love Animated films but for some reason I always have time getting around to seeing a lot of them. Some of the best movies being made are animated and they are always entertaining. Despicable Me and the entire franchise including those beloved and brutally overused Minions completely penetrate our entertainment world. Finally, my daughter just now getting into TV watching, we sat down to watch Despicable Me. She was down after a half hour but I kept watching and had a blast. I finally get the love for this movie. It is completely and utterly adorable, brilliantly performed by the vocal cast, so sweet and a ton of fun. The story was age appropriate and didn't even use a lot of hidden adult jokes or messages which a lot of animated films do nowadays. I would put this more in the camp of Toy Story where it made a smart, sweet movie that doesn't play down to kids and instead aims to impress and tell a great story. Despicable Me is also a unique story in that the villains are the heroes and of course we watch a world class villain overcome with redemption and love for three rambunctious little girls. I can't wait to watch the sequel!! Steve Carell is absolutely one of my favourite comedians and actors in general. I don't think they could have chosen better for someone to voice the 'evil' Gru. He brings passion and life and so much emotion to the character. His voice is recognizable but you'll come to know him as Gru before you know it. Miranda Cosgrove, Dana Gaier and Elsie Fisher do a terrific job as the voices of the three little girls. Carell and the girls just completely draw you in and make you love this story. Jason Segal, Russell Brand, Julie Andrews and Kristen Wiig round out the main supporting cast and they are all fantastic. I think the important thing in an animated film is to be so good at voicing your character that you're indispensable to that character and everyone I mentioned is exactly that.Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud direct the film and I can honestly say they obviously have a fantastic talent for this type of movie. They also do a majority of the work voicing the minions who are way more likable than I anticipated and have such distinct personalities and really balance out the comedy aspect of the film. Despicable Me is just so well put together with a wonderful story and great morals and just a little bit of edge (being all about villains.) Everyone can watch this and just have fun and all for the same reason and not for hidden innuendos. Absolutely should be a staple in any family library. 8.5/10",8,0,0,8 August 2015
Back to the Future Part II," 1600 reviews!!! Another one of my favourites
","After catching one of my all time favourite films (which I reviewed 1000 reviews ago) on the big screen last week, I decided to power through the trilogy since it has been awhile. The entire Back To The Future series in my opinion is absolutely brilliant. It is the quintessential 80's film, the pinnacle of time travel movies, some of the best characters, best script, and cutting edge special effects that still hold up today as far as I'm concerned. When I was a kid I probably would have slapped a 10/10 on all three of the films. I adored them and still do. In watching Back To The Future 2 for the first time in ages I was shocked to discover that while I still LOVED it...I certainly noticed a few of its (albeit very minor) flaws. Back To The Future 2 is actually very different from the original film. Its darker, over the top, even a little cheesy in some regards. It pokes fun at itself and the first film, gives us everything we could possibly want from a sequel while still managing to be a very different sort of movie. I can't think of a single other film that actually returns to the first movie in a whole new way. This is revolutionary, one of a kind and continues to floor me watching Marty's continuing adventures in the backdrop of the first film. This series could be rife with plot holes given how twisted the plot is and I'm sure if you scientifically dissect the film there are some but none that glare the average movie goer in the face. This is a brilliant sequel.Michael J. Fox is Marty Mcfly. In the first film he was smooth, suave, the perfect 'cool kid' that you immediately wanted to be or at least hang around him. Fox returns in Back To The Future 2 and I noticed that his Mcfly this time around is a little less slick but still a great hero. He's almost just a little bit goofy compared to the first film which is a flaw to me but a minor one. Mcfly is still terrific and his turn as his own son and his daughter is awesome to watch. Christopher Lloyd absolutely shines again as the most zany and eccentric inventory Doc. Brown. Lloyd is perfect and no one else could ever make Doc come to life like always has. Best of all the backbone of this series is the incredible chemistry between Fox and Lloyd and this friendship that seems very real. Thomas F. Wilson also returns as senior Biff, middle aged Biff and young Biff and is the ultimate bully and villain. He plays all three roles flawlessly and is so great. He is one of the all time villainous greats while being a complete moron at the same time. Lea Thompson also returns in a much smaller role as Marty's Mom. Thompson is good again but the role is definitely a background role this time around. Many of the supporting characters return as well but Jennifer is replaced by the lovely Elisabeth Shue (her role is very small as well) and Crispin Glover is replaced in the future George role by Jeffrey Weissman though you can hardly tell.This trilogy single-handedly made Robert Zemeckis one of the best directors in my books. Never mind the fact that he then went on to create the incredible world of Forrest Gump (another of my top five films) and many other amazing movies. If you look at Back To The Future 2 (and the entire trilogy) from a film making perspective you can't help but be awe inspired. It is such a unique idea and pioneers the science fiction genre but creating very real characters that you relate to while being silly and outrageous and excessive and sometimes ridiculous and you love every single minute of it. The legendary soundtrack from the first film (Huey Lewis and The News) is lacking from the second film though they still have that amazing theme song of course at the height of every great climactic scene. Hoverboards, past, present and future in one film, running gags galore (manure truck, certain one liners, scenes from the first film, 'Great Scott', the delorean...everything comes together nearly flawlessly. To further prove Zemeckis and Spielberg's brilliance working together on this, there are things they sort of forced into this sequel that weren't in the first (Marty and his fear of being called Chicken for instance) but they work it in their flawlessly and made it instantly memorable. You can't watch the first film without seeing the second...or the third but each film stands firmly in its own unique way. If you have never seen this series...you are absolutely missing out on movie genius and the most entertaining trilogy ever made and if you have seen it before, go watch it again because its rare to have this much fun. 9/10",9,2,4,12 August 2014
The Queen," A highly over-rated bashing of the Monarchy
","I am not English, I have very little knowledge of how the current Monarchy affects the English people, and I have no strong political opinions towards the Monarchy or The British Government. That being said people will say of my review that I didn't 'get' The Queen, I didn't understand what was being said and that may be so because I am taking it at face value and I am truly shocked at the overall feeling of love for this film. That being said I am not surprised at the critical acclaim put toward Helen Mirren in her portrayal because it's quite brilliant. Still I feel The Queen was nothing more than a film makers attempt at stating his political opinions on the Monarchy OR and knowing this director it was in effect an opportunity to shock and cause discussion which case in point it has done for me. Director Stephen Frears, an Englishman, is no stranger to direction. In fact he's one of the most talented and versatile directors in the world. He's done everything from Horror/Drama to Period pieces (which in some ways this could be considered.) All being said I thought the film was downright awful to the picture of the Royal Family while attempting to display the new order and world versus a very old, traditional and respected order. The film does a decent job of worshiping Princess Diana and her death and making appropriate digs at the Papparazzi, while still making The Queen out to be cold, distant, traditional, strong willed, Royal, and controlling. Some of these good, some of them bad. On top of all this the pace of the film is very slow. The film clocks in at a measly hour and a half but it often feels like 3 hours.So what is worth seeing in The Queen?? Well two particular roles stand out for me. First of all you have the infamous Helen Mirren in her second role as Queen in a matter of months. Mirren absolutely transforms herself into Elizabeth and makes her human, and a very strong female lead. She shows emotion, sadness, anger, self reliance...we see her in a way no Queen let alone this Queen has ever been portrayed and it is worthy of an Academy nomination. The second performance is by British actor Michael Sheen, who portrays conservative, moving forward, enormously popular Prime Minister Tony Blair. This is the second time Sheen has performed this part for the same director and it's easy to see why. He nails Blair in every aspect, his tone, his noteworthy smile, his politics, his forcefulness and his gentle side all at once. Sheen is robbed from not being nominated because his performance was equally as great as Mirren's. James Cromwell, who I really do like, portrays Prince Phillip, the Queen's husband and he is portrayed as a loud mouth, hard talking, and overshadowed husband and is even suggested at one point that he has had affairs on his Queen. (This is up for debate of course.) Cromwell is a great actor under the hands of a great director and script and sadly I think his character got the bitter end of this deal. He says a lot but means little to the story. Sylvia Syms is good as The Queen Mother, sassy, outspoken, and shows a little of the traditional style that brought up Queen Elizabeth. Alex Jennings plays Prince Charles and shows my point about how this film wishes to portray the Royal Family. Charles is portrayed as a sniveling, weak, fickle Prince who wants nothing more than to side with the popular people of the time. He certainly shows no strength in the role although has some of the mannerisms down. The supporting cast are all decent enough but even the Queen's supporters truly don't add any argument to the negative portrayal of The Royal Family.I don't mind if a film is political or tries to show a certain view point. I suppose I was just taken aback as to how truly almost satirical the film was towards The Royal Family. They even joke at one point about The Queen 'greasing Diana's brakes.' The entire family comes across as flippant about Diana's death, and downright cruel at parts. Their behavior is revolting and if this is an accurate portrayal of The Royal Family, Britain better start an uprising soon because they are nasty!! Still The Queen is a tolerable film just simply slow moving and a little shocking if you go into it expecting to see some sort of tribute to The Queen and her days handling Diana's death. Some of the visuals in the film of The English Countryside are breath taking and the shots of real footage used for Diana's Mourners are equally astounding. Overall there is nothing impressive about The Queen and it won't stay in my mind for long. Sorry folks. 6/10",6,3,5,7 February 2007
1408," Stephen King at his finest and a film worthy of suspense
","I love Stephen King...adore everything he does and writes. I think he is a downright modern day literary genius and I have loved almost every film based on his works done with the right spin and the right 'King' touch. You can't go wrong because the man is the master of suspense, terror and horror and 1408 is no exception. I credit King as the writer only because screenplay writers Matt Greenberg, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski (all very accomplished writers) did a terrific job of adapting over King's short story and keeping in all the King-ism's that make his stories great. The name of Mike Enslin in itself is a King-ism in some way, the main character is a writer, free to travel and do his thing, separated from his wife, cynical, and then you have the more precise things like the old song suddenly blaring on the radio, turning something mundane into something evil and horrible (ie: The Motel Room) The film just holds it's King style very well and rivets you to the story. Much of that must be accredited to it's lead actor who, like many critics say, performs basically a one-man-show holding 99% of our attention and action and suspense in one room.John Cusack has always been a personal favorite of mine. Somehow I don't think he's really gotten his BIG breakthrough although he has had some incredible roles and 1408 is definitely one of them. Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a low budget horror writer that investigates haunted locals and writes about them. His cynicism and the tragic loss of his daughter has left him believing nothing about the afterlife or ghosts of any kind. Cusack's gradual character change from the cynic to the man trapped by the very essence he fought to not believe is brilliant and he still holds that feisty cynicism even as everything comes crashing around. He is the action star, the dramatic star, the comedic star, and the horror star all in one film sometimes all at once and that makes his performance absolutely brilliant. Of course there is some support there for him including the amazing Samuel L. Jackson who honestly doesn't get much of a chance to be amazing. He has a very small cameo role as the manager of the hotel who pleads with Cusack not to stay in room '1408.' Jackson gets maybe 15 minutes of screen time but he's still fun to watch. Mary McCormack and Jasmine Jessica Anthony play Cusack's family (daughter and wife) and they share a little bit less screen time than Jackson but they are both very good in the perspective roles.'1408' doesn't rely on gore or excessive violence and scares but rather works in the sub conscious creating this eerie and sci-fi type situation with every day situations and objects to really make your skin crawl. There is a surprise around every corner and any time you think you know what's going on it's never the answer. The seemingly 'horrible' ending is not the ending at all and keeps you in your seat for the next half hour. 1408 is the perfect suspense movie for a night at the movies. A worthwhile treat that potentially could be serialized. Only Stephen King could make a terrific story about a killer hotel room. 9/10",9,0,1,1 July 2007
Raging Bull," To each their own has never been so true. I am constantly amazed by people and how they differ
","It has been awhile since I reviewed a stone cold classic. As a movie fanatic with over 700 reviews under my belt I have been trying to see some of these classics for the first time. I finally watched Gone With The Wind (see my review) and loved it, saw Casablanca and was touched (see my review) and now I finally sat down to watch Raging Bull which apparently is considered my some to be the great film of all time...what a statement to live up to. I love Robert DeNiro, the man is a master at his craft, and Martin Scorcese for me is very over hyped. He has had a lot of hits and misses for me, I thought Taxi Driver, and The Departed, were brilliant but on the flip side he has directed some of my least favorite movies including Goodfellas (get over it I hated it), Bringing Out The Dead, Gangs of New York, and now this...considered one of his greatest? Now finally I have to say that I think Martin Scorsese is severely over rated and tries far too hard to make obscurity along with gratuitous violence, language, sex and anything else that can get a rise out of the average viewer. I mean if there was some sort of artistic merit for cramming the most obscenities into a movie than hand it over to this man but when did that ever make a good film? Sadly this is considered one of Robert De Niro's finest roles when in fact I think he had one good scene in the entire movie. The rest of the time he was kind of an ass, beating on his women, going into paranoiac freak outs, and making no sense at all. He looks ridiculous as boxer Jake La Motta and the character is boring and I care so little about him, I can't even believe it. Amazingly Joe Pesci is actually pretty good as La Motta's brother Joey. I figured that Pesci would be no more than he was in Goodfellas which was a ridiculous character that does nothing but beat people into bloody messes and swear until your ears bleed but he actually turns in a serious performance this isn't completely ridiculous. Cathy Moriarty practically puts herself to sleep along with everyone watching this movie as the love of La Motta's life. She looks strung out and she is boring in the role period. I'd go on about the rest of the cast but they are hardly in it and they certainly doesn't make the movie any better nor really any worse because the script and entire idea behind the movie does that right away.Anyone who considers Raging Bull a boxing movie or even BEGIN to compare it to Rocky needs their head examined. First of all there is nothing good about Jake La Motta. He is insane, and an abuser both mentally, physically, and a stone cold scum bag through the entire movie that somehow we are supposed to feel sorry for. He disgusts me more than anything and I guess that's an impressive performance. Second of all for the ten minutes of boxing in this movie it's hardly worth it. What do we get to see? A couple of knock downs and DeNiro beating people's heads in, in black and white. The black and white is a nice touch and I mean it does make the film seem older, more classic but it doesn't over shadow the horribly boring story, and the ridiculous hero they try to make out of someone who is a scum bag in every sense of the world. This movie may have garnered Oscar nods and made DeNiro more of a star but I would love to sit down with anyone and explain to me what entertainment or education or anything that comes out of this because to me it was amateur garbage period. 3/10",3,5,20,13 September 2008
Taken 2," Surprised at how good it looked, but under-delivers and gives you what you'd expect
","Taken was simply an awesome action flick. It sort of catapulted Liam Neeson into macho action star hall of fame. When I heard about Taken 2, I sort of groaned (although I am all for sequels to great movies) but I didn't expect much when I heard of it. However, then the trailers changed my mind. It actually looked like a solid sequel, great action scenes and a decent, if not understandably predictable, storyline. What the film actually delivered was sort of more of what I anticipated before I saw the trailers. It was truly, absolutely and apologetically delivered to make money on the first one. The story was nearly as smart, the action was actually significantly toned down and, while there are always plot holes and reality issues with action films, this one had a lot. The nit pickers will find a million things in the film to complain or laugh at. Some of the plot holes are significant and hard to ignore. However, Liam Neeson's on screen chemistry is also hard to ignore and he carries the picture as he often does. There are some undeniably cool car chases although I feel like I've seen too many European, tight street, car chases.Liam Neeson is good as mysterious likely former-Government killer Bryan Mills. I hoped to get more back story on his character but we get more of the same as we did in the first one. Neeson didn't seem quite as committed to his character in the second outing and his skill set didn't feel quite as impressive but he was good. I don't dislike Famke Janssen but she's never really impressed me. I found her annoying and over-dramatic in this movie. Her and Neeson's chemistry doesn't feel quite right but at the same time I'm glad she came back for the sequel. It gave the story a different direction than the first. I really thought Maggie Grace did a good job though. She had excellent father-daughter chemistry with Neeson and she plays a good damsel in distress type role even though she wasn't really the one in danger this time around. Rade Serbedzija looks the part for a great villain. Unfortunately, I felt like he was completely underused and there was no great buildup to a showdown with him. He seemed almost bored in his scenes and his vengeance quest felt so downplayed.I might be harping on the cast and I shouldn't be because they all do okay...but just okay. I wanted more action, more drama, and more back story on these characters. They had so much untapped mystery to the character of Bryan Mills and they answered no questions whatsoever about his obviously shady past. Simply put they didn't put real effort into the script for the film. French director Olivier Megaton seems to often leave gaps in his films. At least the others I have seen like Columbiana and Transporter 3...it felt like they could have been so much more but not enough effort was put into the story. Taken 2 delivers a lot of potential but never really delivers anything solid. The buildup to showdown with the villains culminates in Neeson fist fighting some random third string character who apparently is super powered and nearly defeats him. The main villains death scene (huge spoiler here) ends with Neeson grabbing his face and shoving him against the wall...which kills him. It was just really a sub part delivery. If you loved Taken, which I did, then you will likely enjoy Taken 2 but you won't love it. Its really a huge step down from the ideas they had. Its simply sub part all around. 6/10",6,0,1,18 October 2012
X-Men: First Class," Breathing powerful new life into a series
","The word re-boot is thrown around and used far too often nowadays. I rarely see anyone re-boot anything that requires rebooting or does it well. I stand on the idea that X-Men: First Class is NOT a reboot but a different direction and a powerful and amazing one, and one of the best films of 2011 for popcorn eating, cheering out loud cinema. The best of a prequel without ignoring the previous films or the Universe and in fact fitting in some amazing cameos from the original films, sticking to the same timeline and bringing in some great new characters and showing us the history of the best characters. Fortunately they also made some downright outstanding casting choices who completely embody their characters. They also don't spend too much time on the new young cast but instead give us the background on the characters everyone was dying to know more about. It gives them the opportunity to explore the new younger cast in future instalments of the film, hopefully being able to keep this alive past just three films.In a different world where films that people love were actually considered for Oscars, Michael Fassbender would be considered for an Oscar for his truly brilliant portrayal of Erik Lehnsherr and eventually Magneto. I think he channels everything that Ian McKellen created but then took it to an incredible new level. You will be riveted by him and his performance. James McAvoy is also excellent. I figured he'd be the one to watch in this movie and he is but Fassbender is so incredible that McAvoy does get pushed down just a little. But McAvoy's young and headstrong Charles Xavier is amazing too. The two of them together have a good chemistry and are great together. McAvoy gets to do things with the character Xavier that no one else has been able to do. Kevin Bacon is terrific as the villainous Sebastian Shaw. He might go a little too far with it and overact but when it all boils down Bacon is outstanding. Nicholas Hoult does an amazing job bringing all the emotional complication to the young character of Beast/Hank McCoy. Jennifer Lawrence also gives a great performance as Mystique, and watching her character and the direction they take is truly outstanding. January Jones is a little bland compared to the rest of the strong cast. Jason Flemyng is dark and demented and I hope to see more of him as the villainous Azazel. The rest of the supporting cast are all fantastic and I don't mean to downplay them but they aren't in the forefront of the story and I think they will be saved for a sequel or two.Matthew Vaughn is fairly new to the spotlight. He sort of rose up to fame in the mainstream with Kick-Ass, and now this should keep him as one of the top directors. The action is non-stop, incredible special effects, some amazing battles that X-Men films are known for but the best thing is all this happens amongst a powerfully strong story, brilliant characters, and even some history thrown in there. This is one action super hero flick that must be seen!! With the absolute plethora of Super Heroes this Summer (2011) it would be hard to stand out but X-Men First Class is indeed just that and the best of all of them the entire year. Check this one out!! 9/10",Null,0,2,22 October 2011
Fifty Shades of Grey," For all the endless non-stop drivel about this film and its content....its really nothing
","I had really no desire to see this. I'm a mid-30's married male and my wife hated 50 Shades (didn't even finish the first book) and she has no desire to see the movie either. I am a huge movie buff and I write reviews so for some unknown reason I felt compelled to watch this. So I did. First of all...its not that bad. It is mostly entertaining in some sort of bizarre romance sort of way. Parts of the film are so campy that its laughable but could it be any other way? The film is anything but offensive. Does it have nudity? Yes. Does it have sex scene? Yes. Is it absurdly X-Rated and shocking? No, not even close. Its completely an adult movie don't get me wrong but there were far more shocking films in the 80's and 90's with the 'baby blue' films as they were once known. The bondage is fairly tame when you think about what they could have done and what it sounds like the book is like. The film is mindless drivel but its not horrible mindless drivel, its entertaining enough and I could see some people getting a kick out of it. Its being taken far too seriously and the protesters should be mindful that the more they fight back, the more people are going to be intrigued by it.The casting is hard to explain. The constant barrage of negative comments against the two leads is not undeserved. They aren't good. In fact in the first half hour or so of the film they are no better than a B-Movie disaster flick. They are horrendous. Then they sort of grow on you in some sort of bizarre silly laughable way. I do have to disagree with many, many critics that they have no chemistry though. I think they do have some chemistry. It isn't amazing but it isn't bad either. In fact the film is made just a little better because they do sort of seem bizarrely connected. Dakota Johnson is insatiably adorable but she is also not a great strong female lead. The character of Anastasia probably sets back women's liberation by fifty years but that's not for me to debate. Johnson grows on you because she is so cute and spunky and a fish out of water so I think she fulfilled the part well enough. Jamie Dornan might be exactly what this character calls for. He seems almost monotone and stoic and bland at times, almost robotic, but is that the point? There is a whole controversy about him being emotionally messed up as to why he loves BDSM and if you want to discuss that...go for it but let's be honest, this is soft core porn not brilliant film making or literary genius. At least they try to make him a complex character. The supporting cast are all decent with no real stand out performers but they do okay. Anastasia's mother, Jennifer Ehle does a solid job as does Christian's mother played by Marcia Gay Harden.I'm more than a little surprised that they gave the reigns of this film to a film maker with very little experience. I think it was wise of them to choose a woman as a director but I also have to give Sam Taylor-Johnson some credit because honestly the best part of this film is the directing. The script and cast and content might be more than a little campy and silly but the cinematography of the film, the bleak and grey city-scapes, flying over the countryside, the lavish offices....all are done with a great amount of artistic style. I also really actually enjoyed the soundtrack with various covers of classic songs both modern and older with some instrumental music that suited the tone of the film. The fact is that the film is not a disaster. It is absolutely NOT for everyone and if you're looking for a safe and simple romance, this isn't it but the romance isn't bad and the bondage takes a back seat to the character relationship. I would almost say (as ridiculous as it sounds) that the sex scenes just get in the way of what could have been otherwise a simple and campy little romance story. If you're against this movie, take my advice...IGNORE IT! The more people talk about it, the more it'll make. Otherwise just take it for what it is. Its hardly the worst thing I've ever seen. 7/10",7,8,10,4 March 2015
The Wolverine," Overthought and downright boring. The worst Marvel movie yet?
","Most people would say that X-Men 3: The Last Stand was the worst of the X-Men franchise but I actually would say that all of the films up until The Wolverine have been very good including X-Men 3. I had heard very mixed opinions about The Wolverine but I assumed that it would have to be at least good...I assumed wrong. First of all, what a mess. What an awful, complex, silly, over thought mess ruined by someones delusions of turning Wolverine into some sort of Ninja epic. Perhaps the worst sin of this film is that Wolverine isn't even himself. He isn't doing what he does best for most of the film and that is truly a shame. Hugh Jackman was perhaps one of the best casting jobs in Hollywood history and they completely lay waste to his talent and to the character in general. The action scenes are few and far between making everything in between drag excruciatingly. I realized after about an hour and a half that I was more or less completely lost and worst of all I didn't care at all that I was lost. The pointless and needless tie in to the previous X-Men Franchise marred this film terribly. We don't need to be reminded every ten minutes that Logan is torn up over Jean Grey. I don't know why we're wrapping this franchise back around it's original from ten plus years ago.I certainly don't place any of the blame of Hugh Jackman. He instantly embodies everything about Wolverine and is brilliant in the role...usually. Unfortunately this particular adventure leaves so much to be desired and reduces him to barely a shell of the former character. It is literally like the life is nearly gone from Wolverine. I hate to bash the rest of the cast because I don't necessarily think the poor performances were entirely their fault. The other characters are so drab and so cookie cutter without any development and you never become attached to any of them. Total newcomer Rila Fukushima looks stunned through the whole movie. The chemistry opposite Jackman is barely existent and her character gets lots in a convoluted plot. Same could be said for Tao Okamoto who requires even more chemistry with Jackman and yet has even less with him. Hal Yamanouchi is a decent villain but somehow he is underused but also overplayed at the same time. He comes across as campy. Many of the performances reminded me a lot of Pacific Rim from earlier this year and believe me when I say that is NOT a compliment.I was a little surprised to see James Mangold was helming this film because he is a talented director. Marvel, overall, has had the smarts to put a comic geek at heart at the helm of each of their pictures and I think perhaps Mangold is a real grown up and not a comic geek and it sort of ruined the film. I am devastated that he is attached to do the next Wolverine film too because this was just an enormous mis-step in the X-Men lore. Literally the best scene of the entire film was the after credits scene. The train battle scene mid-film that I thought looked like awful CGI in the trailer actually turned out to be the best fight in the film and the most action. None of this made sense and none of it felt like Wolverine. I am literally angry that this was so bad. If you're a Marvel fan you will see it regardless but be prepared for the worst appearance yet from a comic hero. 3/10",3,1,3,1 December 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," The ups and downs of one of the most talked about movies of 2012...or ever.
","Where can I even begin with The Dark Knight Rises. It is one of the biggest films of all time and the most talked about and on and on. The one thing I can say for certain is that this film was just absolutely massive, too big for its own good. For all the series now (Twilight, Harry Potter, Hunger Games) that have or are splitting their last films into two...Dark Knight Rises could have been split into two or even three films. It was too much all at once. It was an entirely trilogy of story and happenings jammed into one movie which makes it feel simply overwhelming at times. It ups the ante and absolutely defines epic but just feels so crowded at times. The film deals with some powerful political and social issues, creates some absolutely epic villainous battles and easily redefines the superhero genre. This will never be compared to Marvel's Avengers in style or content. This is the furthest thing from your typical Batman flick. It even easily sets itself apart from Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. It doesn't even feel like the same trilogy but it does indeed complete a trilogy defiantly and exactly. Did I feel there were significantly some poor things done in this film? Absolutely. I think it was because so much had to be packed into the movie. Were there plot holes? Oh man...gaping, 747 sized plot holes. Was I annoyed by some things? You bet. Did the epic stature, the performances, the sheer unapologetic balls it took to make this win me over past all the negative? Yep kinda. If Christopher Nolan were standing in front of me and demanded to know what was wrong with his movie...I'd say...not a darn thing sir because this film took absolute dedication, brilliance and some serious SERIOUS ambition.Christian Bale returns as Bruce Wayne and Batman. Neither character will you ever see in the same way again. Bale is good. I still don't know if he's my favourite Batman/Bruce Wayne actor...I'm still not convinced but you can't deny his dark twisted side and he is a strong actor. Sometimes I feel like his Batman his overacted, even in an incredibly dark movie like this one. His growly voice is legendary but its almost barely understandable by the third instalment. Tom Hardy is our new villain, Bane. I won't talk about his poorly edited voice because its been talked about to death. Hardy still gives a great performance. He is a powerful villain and their chemistry is good against each other. Its not as good as Ledger and Bale's was but its good. Their adversarial battles are based on pure strength making their two main fight scenes intense and brilliant. Joseph Gordon-Levitt joins the cast as a true blue Gotham officer. He is a good addition and a good character. I wanted to see more from him but he is definitely a strong member of the cast. Anne Hathaway is our legendary Catwoman. This was one of the biggest issues I had with the film is that she wasn't Catwoman. She could have been any random thief because there was no back story or definitive things that made her the character we all know as Catwoman. That being said Hathaway was good in the role, not her best, but she was good. I thought she overplayed it sometimes the same way Bale does. Marion Cotillard is another new addition who does well. She doesn't really stand out but she is still good. There is one cast member that I thought was truly amazing in this film and that was Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon. Oldman was amazing, breathtaking, Oscar worthy I think. He showed a level of emotion and strength rarely seen in an action movie character especially a supporting character. Returning cast members Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine add their usual stature and solid performances to the film. Whether the actors in the film were good, really good, or outstanding...no one held back. No one was bad, everyone came together as an ensemble cast and made an epic movie.Ambition. That is the word I kept thinking about all through this film. This has to be easily one of the most ambitious action films ever made. The story spans every possible aspect of a storyline. You could not create something so massive without some plot holes and there are plenty. Bruce Wayne's sudden and immediate recovery using a 'magic' robotic leg brace is ludicrous, Bane's death was severely disappointing...a complete let down, the flying Bat-machine was silly...really didn't fit in with Nolan's world, the scene in the 'jail' hole went on WAY too long, Catwoman was misused and mis-created in my opinion. However, the very first Batman/Bane battle just about brought tears to my eyes...it was brilliant and completely symbolized and personified the amazing comic from where it came from. The action scenes, including the very first car chase scene when Batman returns was just amazing. The cinematography in the film was hands down unequivocally brilliant. Nolan is an absolute master at direction and should get an Oscar nod for directing on cinematography alone. Truth be told I could personally debate and discuss and dissect The Dark Knight Rises for months...in some ways I have been. I thought the ending was brilliant, a perfect ending in most ways. And in case anyone is wondering...I believe his 'legal name' was a cheeky joke and not supposed to demonstrate who he was going to become. I can't say to see this or not because most likely you have seen it, or you will see it, because when all is said and done this film will be legendary and the trilogy is pure excellence throughout all else. The good absolutely outweighs the negatives because of the sheer intellect and ambition and cast. 9/10 (After viewing it three times)",9,3,6,5 December 2012
Iron Man," Could have been dangerous turf to tread on but they smacked it out of the park
","I definitely had my doubts about Iron Man. First of all I am not a big Marvel fan, always been a DC kid, and Marvel has been churning out stinkers including the less than stellar Spiderman 3, Daredevil, Hulk, Fantastic 4 and so forth. I had very, very low expectations for the film and then the reviews started coming in from professional critics and...they loved it? They raved about it and then people started talking about how great it was and I knew I had to see it and find out for myself. First of all I can say that Iron Man is absolutely captivating. Nothing I feared for the film pans out...I thought special effects would be over blown and cheesy and they weren't even close!! I thought the story would be too fantastical to translate to screen and they did it perfectly. I had no background on Iron Man, never read a comic but it seemed to me to be the last hero you'd want to try to make into a serious live action film but it seems to me that the film makers took very careful steps in bringing the character to life and hired a cast that was quite simply brilliant in every way. A really great ensemble, a well thought out story, good but not overblown special effects, and really kept true to their fans already existing.Robert Downey Jr. is being heralded for his performance as Billionaire arms dealer Tony Stark. He is excellent. He has a flare certainly for the sarcastic biting comedic wit. However that alone would have made him nothing more than a George Clooney as Batman fiasco but to my surprise he also made a terrific hero and leading man and really lights up the screen with his personality and performance. Terrence Howard who is a really terrific actor gets a supporting role without a lot of depth but given Howard's ability he makes a great pseudo sidekick to Downey Jr. performance. I think his character could have been given more but he does excellent. Jeff Bridges is just an amazing super villain. His story starts out on the low end and really turns him into the ultimate villain by the end with a very cool robotic fight at the end. He is just an excellent adversary and also extremely talented. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to the big budget screen as a sidekick to Tony Stark and somewhat of a love interest as Pepper Potts. Her role is toned down as well so as to not overshadow the main character but she is good opposite Downey Jr. and their chemistry is excellent. Throw in the obligatory appearance by co-creator and Marvel god Stan Lee (who I immediately recognized the first time) and a very small cameo role by director Jon Favreau and you've got an incredible cast together with a great story.As with all Superhero films we have to get the creation of the character and the unique thing about Iron Man is that the entire film nearly is Stark creating and perfecting this persona and then exacting revenge and saving the world from his own weapons. The story definitely leaves everything wide open to serialize (they've already announced a sequel) but can they possibly re-create the same great team and story that they did for this one. To me, who had very low expectations, I have to feel like this was a big successful fluke that all these pieces fell into place but maybe I'm being pessimistic. Regardless Iron Man starts off the summer blockbusters with a huge bang and you won't be disappointed in the story, the action, the characters, the actors or anything else about it. I just found myself completely enthralled by the story as fantastical as it seems, somehow they found a way to make it real and bring it to life without it looking stupid and I thought that would be their real challenge but I was wrong. Iron Man is absolutely astounding!!! 9/10",9,1,2,21 May 2008
Creed II," Living up once again to it's 40 year legacy
","Creed breathed new live into the Rocky franchise because it's less about Rocky and far more about Adonnis Creed. The best thing about Creed II is that it focuses so heavily on father and son relationships and what that means in three very different circumstances. Rocky and his son are estranged and Rocky doesn't know how to reach out to him and there is that father-son relationship between Rocky and Adonnis. You have Adonnis and Apollo, the son trying to live up to his father's legendary status but now also avenge his death and you have Ivan Drago and his son where he has raised this child in the shadow of his own failure. Rocky IV is generally considered the highlight of that franchise and certainly his greatest battle and this being a direct sequel to that makes Rocky fans happy and fans of the new Creed storyline happy to. It has deep drama and story, incredible action and intense performances. The scene where Drago and Rocky meet in Rocky's restaurant is complete perfection.
I wasn't sure how I would feel about Michael B Jordan taking over the Rocky franchise and whether I could ever buy him as the underdog boxer that I would root for. Creed was good but I still wasn't sure. I'm no longer unsure. Jordan completely owns this role and proves himself fully. He leads this film with great power and intensity. Sylvester Stallone returns as Adonnis' mentor and trainer Rocky Balboa. He takes even more of a secondary position in the film but enough that fans will still love seeing him back in the role but doesn't get in the way of the main story. Dolph Lundgren is incredible in this film. This might actually be his best role he's ever had period. In Rocky IV he was a machine that was meant to be a steel monster but now we see his humanity and what the loss has done for him and how he's trained his son. He is literally the highlight of this movie. Equally as impressive is Florian Munteanu who plays Drago Junior. He captures that steel monster that his father once was but he plays so much drama and intensity in his expressions. There is a scene with him and his father at a dinner table where you literally see him looking for approval. Tessa Thompson also returns as Bianca and gets even more screen time and an even better role than the first. Her and Jordan have good chemistry and I wasn't sure about her either until this movie. Phylicia Rashad also returns in a larger role as Adonnis' mother and gets some really solid screen time.Steven Caple Jr. had a big job ahead of him. He's a virtual unknown director taking over for someone who got fans and critics on their side with the first Creed. I was worried this was a mistake bringing on a director with little experience but he captures this story and takes what Creed started and vaults it into the stratosphere. He packs almost too much into one film but it harkens back to the great Rocky films, pays homage to that but hyper focuses on Creed and that new legacy. Creed II is as good as the best from this franchise and ensures we get more in the future. Watching my idol (Stallone) hit the big screen yet again was an unforgettable experience. 9/10",9,41,74,24 November 2018
Monsters University," So sweet it'll give you cavities but full of heart
","I THINK I saw Monsters Inc. I know that sounds absurd but I honestly can't remember it. I certainly know of it and could name the characters because it was a huge hit. Friends of mine chose this one and I was looking forward to seeing it though it wouldn't have been my first choice. Monsters University is adorable simply put. It is the perfect movie for youngsters and it is one of the few animated projects I have seen in a long time that doesn't try to gear itself towards adults and children. This one is really for the kids. That's completely, 100% okay and I think that's awesome. It is squeaky, undeniably clean. It doesn't even try to use hidden innuendo jokes to appease the adult audiences. It is fun and boisterous and has so many great characters and monsters for the kids to just fall in love with. The animated ranges from good to great. The whole film is well done animated wise but the scenes when Mike and Sully slip through to a human summer camp is some really incredible special effects so bravo for that. For me, as an adult, it didn't blow me away but then its not meant to. Pixar has done some truly incredible movies, some of my favourites...Toy Story (of course), Wall-E and UP to name three of the best animated films I have ever seen. Monsters University doesn't sit on the same playing field as them in my books but it was fun.When Billy Crystal and John Goodman first brought Mike and Sully to life they created icons. That was an unbelievable 12 years ago and Monsters University only serves to remind us just how great those two characters are and the two of them suit their characters so well and just completely bring them to life. They have such recognizable voices and yet they are as recognizable as Crystal and Goodman as they are as Mike and Sully. The rest of the cast is just terrific too. Steve Buscemi returns as Randall, Helen Mirren is just unbelievably perfect as Dean Hardscrabble, Peter Sohn was awesome as Squishy (one of my favourite of the new characters), Sean Hayes and Dave Foley were great as the two headed Terry and Terri, Joel Murray, Charlie Day and to save one of the best for last Nathan Fillion was outstanding as head jock Johnny Worthington. The cast just worked so well together, whether or not they actually read lines together I don't know but everyone was so great and many of them have such recognizable voices but it never took away from the characters they were creating.The film is quite long comparatively to some animated films. I wonder since the film is so specifically geared towards children if it needed to be that long but certainly there is plenty going on at all times. My favourite scene is round one of the scare games with the spiked balls that gives the monsters swollen body parts...it was hilarious and fun. Dan Scanlon is a co-writer and director on the film and he is fairly new to the Pixar company and yet you would never know it because he certainly brings everything to the table you would expect from a classic Disney style film and Pixar. I was actually a little surprised at the overall message behind Monsters University. Spoilers are indeed ahead so stop reading if you don't want the ending ruined. Mike and Sully are ultimately expelled from Monsters University. Because of this they decide instead to start at the bottom and work their way up to the position of scarers within Monsters Inc. I thought that was a surprising thing to show to children. I do agree with that message that school doesn't mean everything and there are alternate ways to achieve your dream but I was surprised is all I mean by that. Monsters University will have you chuckling without really laughing out loud, it'll have you say 'awww' a few times but I don't think most parents and adults will find it nearly as entertaining as children will. It is fun though and I don't remember the original but it seems like to me that they came back and perfectly captured the spirit of Monsters Inc. twelve years later so bravo to them for that. 7/10",7,0,2,4 July 2013
Casino Royale," I've lost my Bond virginity and I don't know what took me so long
","It's true...I am 28 years old and I have never laid eyes on a Bond film...well until now of course. I had decided some time ago when they picked Daniel Craig as the latest Bond that I would go see it on the big screen and I am really glad I finally took that chance on Bond because James Bond is the spy of all spies just like everyone has always said he was. Now granted I do understand that Casino Royale is perhaps not the average Bond film and this is an all new Bond but I still thought Craig was downright brilliant. I will make it my mission to see every Bond film and decide for myself who is James Bond. As of right now Craig is my Bond hands down and for good reason. Casino Royale is complex, and even now I'm a little confused by the entire plot and the ending and yet it doesn't matter much because Craig was such an incredible screen presence, and the action was terrific, the opening scenes were brutal and captivating and the direction was amazing from Poker Games to gun battles.Of course as everyone knows now Mr. Daniel Craig takes the role as Agent 007 James Bond. Now this is a prequel to any other Bond film and Bond has just received his 00 status and his license to kill. I never realized that Bond was so much a hit man, basically a suave, seducing, killer. I never pictured him as that brutal or heartless but he really is. Craig's Bond is also sassy and rough around the edges and very cold and calculating, smart but also a little cocky and foolish in some places which isn't a Bond characteristic I didn't think. Craig is still a sure fire box office hit!! Eva Green is the latest Bond girl and she fits the bill. She's sexy, sultry and still knows how to kick some ass. Her performance at times is a little dry and could use some heart but for the most part she does well and her and Craig are decent together although not exactly ideal. Mads Mikkelsen plays the deliciously evil Bond villain Le Chiffre and Craig and Mikkelsen makes terrific adversaries and have some intense moments that are more dramatic and about eye contact and body language than actual contact. Mikkelsen is devilish and looks evil but plays the part well. Dame Judi Dench also returns adding her truly majestic class to the cameo role of Bond's boss 'M.' Her clever and intelligent banter with Bond is key to the film.A little bit campy, a little bit overblown, a little bit dark, a little bit funny...I think this is the Bond formula, am I wrong?? If that is the case then Casino Royale fits the bill and knocks one out of the park. It wasn't a perfect film, I wasn't exactly blown away by my first entry into the Bond series but I still couldn't deny the film's presence and importance. Director Martin Campbell returns to the Bond franchise, having previously directed Goldeneye and he is no stranger to action or thriller which I found Bond to be more of a thriller than an action film despite some truly astounding and random explosions. I think that Bond fans will absolutely die over Casino Royale and I think if you are like me and have never bothered to enter into the Bond franchise, this is your chance to see a truly great action star make way into the world of Hollywood in a Bond film that further cements it's importance in cinema history. 8.5/10",8,0,5,18 December 2006
Toy Story 3," An absolutely brilliant entry proving this is the most brilliant animated series of all time
","If there is any proof that sequels even third entries can be as brilliant as their originals...Toy Story proves it. Fifteen years later not only do they bring back the characters we know and love but make us love them even more and bring literally the best completion to a trilogy of all time...(Sorry Return of The King fans.) I love sequels personally even when they are bad but I think if they truly end the Toy Story series here they couldn't have done it more brilliantly. This is probably the best movie you'll see in 2010 so far and easily the best movie of the summer. Toy Story has absolutely everything that made the first film so amazing and best of all we see a young boy grow up like so many of us have since the original film and say goodbye to our friends...the toys. Despite a beautiful, moving, emotional, happy ending there is that feeling of sadness and reminiscing of days gone by. The fact that a 'cartoon' can bring all this out proves its brilliance but Toy Story 3, and the Toy Story series has never been a 'cartoon' but rather THEE animation epic that sets the bar for every other animated film in existence.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen return to their incredible iconic roles in the biggest of ways. Best of all Tim Allen gets some of the most solidly funny, roll in the aisles moments as Buzz is set back to his 'demo' mode and switched to Spanish speaking which will have everyone in tears laughing. Both men should get SOME sort of award for 15 years of two of the best characters in film history. Their chemistry is stepped up from the second film and the two buddies are back in full force. Joan Cusack (used sparingly and much less annoyingly as Toy Story 2) is great as Jessie, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Estelle Harris, John Morris, Jodi Benson (hilarious!), and Laurie Metcalf all return to their roles and are as brilliant as ever. Imagine one of the best casts of all time coming back together after fifteen years and picking up where they left off. There is some real important newcomers to mention. First of all Slinky Dog takes a bit of a back seat role with the death of his voice Jim Varney and comedian Blake Clark takes over and does a solid job but somehow the character doesn't have the same feel to him. Michael Keaton is mind blowing as Ken (yes of Barbie and Ken.) He is absolutely hilarious and the character is just perfectly written and created. Teddy Newton voices the great character of the 'chatter telephone' (who didn't have one of these!!) Another amazing addition to the cast but without voice is 'Big Baby' who almost brought tears of sadness to my eyes when she/he gurgles 'Mama.' Finally...lets talk about the character that became one of my favorite characters of all time. Ned Beatty (best known to me as the bumbling sidekick of Lex Luthor in Superman films from the eighties) voices Lotso. A teddy Ruxpin like character who has become inherently evil after being abandoned by his owner. Lotso is absolutely villainous and Beatty is amazing behind the voice. He is the best villain of any cartoon I have ever seen and perhaps one of the best in film in general. If the hundred other reasons aren't enough to see this the character of Lotso makes this a must see.I mentioned when reviewing the first film that the intensity of certain scenes make the film almost too much for really young kids and a terrific nail biter for everyone and Toy Story 3 takes that to a whole new level. These toys are cast aside and go from a Nursery school like concentration camp, to a garbage dump, to being seconds from being incinerated. Then you have the terrifying trio of Lotsa, and his bumbling buffoons Big Baby, and Ken who literally torture and lock up the toys. Regardless the message behind the film will likely leave most with their heart strings pulled. Toy Story 3 has the happiest and the saddest ending of any film out there. Obviously if you haven't seen the Toy Story series then don't see Toy Story 3 because although it would still be great, the film becomes truly brilliant when you already know and love these characters. Advertised largely in 3D (like every other movie it seems) but the 3D won't make or break this film. The movie stands clearly on its own merits as being absolutely amazing. 9.5/10",9,1,3,4 July 2010
Bull Durham," A movie about the game
","The tag line for Bull Durham says it all. 'It's all about sex and sport. What else is there?' Nothing when it comes to this film. That sounds harsh but there really is nothing else to this film!! Films can be made about a sport, or a sport can be made into a film. What I mean is sometimes certain films are made that completely encompasses a sport, it's all about that particular sport and with Bull Durham Costner begins his infamous Baseball trilogy. Bull Durham really does encompass Baseball, both stars Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner show an emotional attachment to the game that is touching and very real. The only other thing that abounds in the film besides baseball is sex...and I wouldn't even call it romance because I didn't feel any romance between the characters just sex based on baseball.Tim Robbins really gives a stand out performance as Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh. He's young, self absorbed, hot headed and also gives a great comedy performance because of his character. He truly does a great job and is the only one in the film who comes close to having any sort of chemistry with real life love Susan Sarandon...perhaps that's where the chemistry comes from as they met on this film. He also has a great even better chemistry with Kevin Costner. The two butt heads but support each other and become great friends and it's fun to watch the two of them go head to head. Costner, who has always been one of my favorite actors, does a good job playing Crash Davis. He plays the old timer of the film despite being still young, as far as baseball is concerned he is the mentor of the film. He teaches 'Nuke' LaLoosh in seemingly harsh lessons but in the end turns him into a big league pitcher. I didn't feel any chemistry whatsoever between Costner and Sarandon but I don't blame him. Sarandon, to me, was so out of place in this film. She has had some wonderful roles in her life but this just wasn't meant for her. I thought she was too old and quite frankly too classy to be playing a 'ball girl.' She was believable as the experienced lover but just not as the tramp she was made to play. I didn't think she made the good female lead.Ron Shelton who wrote and directed the film did a great job of capturing the spirit of baseball, there is no doubt about that. He created some great characters in Crash Davis and 'Nuke' LaLoosh. Anyone who has a love for baseball is going to in turn love this film but if you're not a fan you might find it a tad drab. Any time Shelton writes or directs he tries to capture the reality of the situation whether it be baseball, basketball (White Men can't Jump), boxing (Play It To The Bone), or police work (Dark Blue and Hollywood Homicide.) He knows about the buddy system and about the topics he creates but Bull Durham is one of his better films. For sports fans a real treat!! 8/10",8,5,10,21 August 2005
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Woody Allen takes my virginity...wow does that ever sound wrong?
","As huge a film buff as I am I am almost sure I have never laid eyes on a Woody Allen film. I think I might have seen bits and pieces of Match Point but that's the closest I've ever came. So I decided while in the city to see Vicky Christina Barcelona and change that once and for all. I know Allen's reputation...obscure and candid visions of love and reality and life and in that way I think Vicky Christina Barcelona fits Allen's genre profile perfectly. It might be different for him but it's the same idea and the message is blindingly clear in a droll, sarcastic, almost darkly comedic way. Life's perfection is in the eye of the person living it. Fortunately the film finds it's way into being not just some piece of Allen art but actually pretty entertaining. I hesitate to refer to it as a romance because of the twisted nature of the whole thing but isn't that just the entire idea of an Allen film? Certainly the third part of the film's title helps the entire idea and that's Barcelona. The stunning cinematography and beautiful Spanish setting is fun to watch and just very lovely. I did learn a great deal about Woody Allen fans as people around me of all ages laughed to tears like they were watching a slapstick Steve Carell movie. I mean Allen's sense of humor is not slapstick by any means and while the humor was very tongue in cheek and more something you'd smirk at these people thought it hilarious.Rebecca Hall is really terrific as straight laced, level headed Vicky who does everything in her power to convince herself and her best friend that life is black or white and never gray. Hall doesn't really shoot to the forefront of the film but she is still really good and does a great job supporting the stronger cast. I'm not sure though that she could carry a film on her own. Still within the cast she is good. I admit that I figured no matter what I thought of my first Woody Allen movie I knew it couldn't be that bad cause I would have Scarlett Johansson to look at. I mean remarkably the girl is talented despite some obscure choices in the roles over the years but the drop dead sexy, voluptuous blonde bombshell does a great job playing carefree, and morally obscured Christina. The role seems to fit her very well. She is lovely to watch and her character is fiery and keeps the story moving at a great pace. Javier Bardem takes a big turn from last years disappointing No Country for Old Men, as free spirited Spanish artist Juan Antonio who has some passionate views about true love and the likes. Bardem looks remarkably sexy and has a very passionate affair with Johansson and has good chemistry with both girls. He does a terrific job in his role and no one else could have given the performance like he does. Penélope Cruz gives a mind blowing incredible performance as Bardem's completely unbalanced passionate Spanish ex-wife Maria Elena. She is the highlight of the film completely and utterly. The film builds her character for a good portion of it, her wild personality and Bardem's turbulent and passionate relationship with her that you figure the actual appearance of her and the relationship would be anti climatic but that isn't the case at all. Bardem and Cruz are fiery and passionate and darkly hilarious. Christopher Evan Welch also adds to the Allen style as the monotoned but perfectly added Narrator to the entire story.The characters are all very different, each with their own view on life, and each in their own place and this one trip to Barcelona effects each one of them in a different way. In the end do any of them learn anything about love? I kind of think...no. Allen's film could be intellectually debated for hours but it could also just be watched and enjoyed although some might find the story a little juvenile and the movie moves kind of slowly. The hour and a half feels like two hours easy. One of the most shocking parts of the entire film is all the rumor and barrage of media coverage about a 'steamy scene' between stars Cruz and Johansson which I can promise you never happens except for a very brief kiss that is hardly erotic at all. It seems that a lot of film buffs and critics are doing what tends to happen with artsy movies and that is they are making a bigger deal about it than it deserves. While it entertains and has some interesting intellectual properties, it isn't mind blowing, nor does it revolutionize film making. It's just a good movie period. 8/10",8,3,9,24 August 2008
Saving Mr. Banks," A sweet story that is truly 'delightful.'
","I read another review that called this movie delightful and I had to repeat it because that is exactly what this is. Its a unique look at one of the most iconic films in history. We all know Mary Poppins but how many of us know anything about where it came from. I'm not even sure I knew it was a book series. The film is fun, touching, sweet, and even moving at times. The dual stories of Walt Disney and 'Mrs. Travers' and then the story of her growing up in Australia works very well and adds a whole other layer to this film. You wouldn't think a movie like this would have stunning cinematography but it has exactly that when showing the dusty outback. Mary Poppins is one of the most magical, timeless films ever made and this movie captures some of that making it very magical in its own way. It is perfect set in the 60's and literally transports you onto the lot of Walt Disney Studios during that time. It doesn't shove the time period on you but rather subtly immerses you into that era. The story is definitely character driven and the chemistry between our main actors is so important and I think it truly soars. I mean both of them are icons in their own right and together they are perfect for the film.I am of course referring to Mr. Tom Hanks and the lovely Ms. Emma Thompson in a Golden Globe nominated performance. Hanks is perfect as Walt Disney and I think shares a lot in common with the man. We were blessed this year to have TWO Tom Hanks films from someone I think is probably one of the most talented and gifted actors in Hollywood history. His Walt Disney is electric and charismatic and you love him instantly and I think Hanks is the same way so it was easy for him to do it. Emma Thompson was simply outstanding as the curmudgeonly writer who wants her precious Mary Poppins protected. It is amazing even if this only a small portion of what she was like that the film got made at all. Thompson and Hanks are so good together, their chemistry is near perfect and their banter back and forth just incredibly entertaining. Thompson's off-beat chemistry with everyone in the film is amazing and makes this film a winner. The supporting cast were superb especially the likes of Paul Giamatti (amazingly touching role as a quiet meek limo driver who wins Thompson's friendship), Bradley Whitford, BJ Novak and Jason Schwartzman as the exhausted and often annoyed writers and musicians trying to get the film made. You would be hard pressed to find a more uplifting scene than when Bradley Whitford gets Thompson to dance with him to 'Let's Go Fly a Kite.' Lily Bigham and Kathy Baker were also quite good in very small roles as Disney's secretaries. In the Australian story you have Colin Farrell as the alcoholic, depressed but adoring father of the young Ginty. Farrell's role is heartbreaking and he does a great job with only a few important scenes. Ginty is played by a newcomer by the name of Annie Rose Buckley and this role should firmly have future offers rolling in because she is perfect and does such a great job! Ruth Wilson is decent as Ginty's emotionally distraught mother. She doesn't get a lot of depth to her character but she serves her purpose.In many ways John Lee Hancock is the perfect director for this. Saving Mr. Banks has a similar emotional depth to his previous hit The Blind Side. He has a knack for bringing true to life stories to the big screen. There is just something you connect to with these people and Tom Hanks makes you feel like you're experiencing being in the presence of Walt Disney. Its the little things like his personality, the quirk of him hiding his smoking in his office and the sheer look of joy on his face when he is waiting at Disneyworld with his arms open wide. Everything about this film is feel good even the dark scenes you know there is a light behind it all. An absolute must see and a Disney classic in its own right. Bravo. 9/10",9,1,3,17 December 2013
Beowulf," Visuallly stunning saves the film from obscurity
","I suppose I had decently high expectations for Beowulf as it did really look impressive and I enjoy period/historical films or mythical in this case. Beowulf will and is doing very well and for good reason. First of all I think the phenomenal Robert Zemeckis is really on to something with this style of film making and I think over the next few years we will see some incredible developments with CGI film making like we have seen with this film, Final Fantasy films, and Polar Express but Beowulf captures it and makes it it's own and does it brilliantly. The film is jaw dropping to look at. The characters are seamless (most of them) and it's just incredible the detail and movements and setting. You just can't even get over how stunning this is considering it is animated at heart. The characters (again most of them) are spitting images of their counterparts. This could lead to some great advances in movie making including the idea of perhaps putting late great actors back into films...controversial but very doable. Marlon Brando could return to the screen, Harrison Ford could do action films into his nineties....and so forth. So the unfortunate part of how stunning Beowulf is that the story lacks something...passion perhaps, a steady and intriguing story? I mean of course Beowulf is classic Urban Legend but there just was missing something....it wasn't the action, there were some incredible battles and sword play. Some of the characters lacked depth or story and just left you feeling like you wanted more from it.Ray Winstone is Beowulf (as he tells us approximately eight times according to my count.) Still Winstone does a terrific job capturing this character. He's a man's man hero, rough, rugged, masculine, and very naked for a good portion of this film. And it's not sexual naked because he's battling Grendal (the beast) during his scenes of nudity. If I were Winstone I'd be quite proud of my animated counter part. Still he adds style, class and real rugged heroism to the part. I think Anthony Hopkins truly steals the show as King Hrothgar. His character is startlingly real and resembles him in every way and such detail in the face and his voice and emotion is truly incredible. This is a terrific highlight of the film and Hopkins makes the movie worthwhile by himself. Robin Wright Penn is his young Queen Wealthow and she is one of the few characters that has such little depth that she looks like a zombie through most of the film. She shows little emotion, even when she sings it sounds robotic and her character looks far more cartoon-y than any other. She was almost a pointless character except for the object of Beowulf's affections which doesn't even blossom into anything at all. If you look closely enough you can literally see Crispin Glover in the beast that is Grendal. He does an amazing job which is either in part to his acting and voice performance or to the creation of the beast which is hideous and yet somehow you feel pity for the beast and illegitimate son of the King. Brendan Gleeson is terrific and yet another one of those sadly underused and underdeveloped characters as Beowulf's right hand man. Finally Angelina Jolie's chilling voice and mysterious demeanor definitely adds to the villain that is Grendal's mother. Mostly she is used for pixel-ated eye candy...but they did a decent job on that as well.The film relies almost entirely on it's two main battles. The first one is Beowulf's naked battle with Grendal which is an intense and well done battle and the second is the edge of your seat incredible battle with the Dragon in Beowulf's later life stages. Both are incredible and just grip you into your seat and leave you breathless but there is hardly any story in between the two battles to hold it all together. There is no romance or character exploration or any real story besides these I have mentioned. It doesn't make the film unwatchable at all...it just means that the film could have been a mind blowing ten but unfortunately sits around average good film for me with an eight. Still it's worth seeing again and again for it's stunning reality in animation, the amazing performance by Sir Anthony Hopkins and some really beautiful scenery and the winter stricken Denmark. Not the greatest film out there but a decent action flick for adults. 8/10",8,1,4,20 December 2007
Speed," Hands down one of the best action films in existence
","I can review Speed very easily. It defines riveting, edge of your seat, pulse pounding, action packed, breathless action. The concept is just brilliant and the first time I saw Speed many years ago I remember barely being able to sit on my seat let alone be on the edge of it. It just takes you away, knocks it out of the park and keeps you riveted for the entire run time. Is it perfect? No. It actually has a ton of flaws when you start to dissect it but the film making is so good, the concept so captivating that you forget and ignore everything that is silly about it. A great action movie should be able to make you suspend reality and believe every word and scene they show you. Speed will make you ignore how ridiculous it is that they jump a full sized city bus across a gaping hole in an overpass and instead you will stand up, cheer and root for that scene. Some of the film is honestly bordering on cheesy and it just doesn't matter one lick because this is the most adrenaline packed, thrill ride you will ever lay your eyes on.90's Movie star Keanu Reeves was probably the perfect choice for this film. He has the star power and the clout and the chemistry to pull off being the hero of this movie. No one could have done it better. That being said Reeves has a particular style to him that is inherently cheesy. When I watched Speed again and again I found myself laughing more at his performance but it doesn't change the fact that he is the star and carries the movie just fine. Sandra Bullock is fantastic in her role as Annie. Annie is fun and wild and clumsy and just a great female hero. Her and Reeves actually have great chemistry and Bullock fans will absolutely love this performance. Dennis Hopper is deliciously evil as Howard Payne (what a great bad guy name), and like Reeves has a certain B-Movie quality to his character but does it so well and the cat and mouse between him and Reeves is perfect. Jeff Daniels plays Reeves partner and does a good job. The only issue with him is that I wish they had used him more in the story. I wish I could mention all of the supporting cast because they are all really good in their roles especially the other passengers on the bus.I don't think director Jan de Bont has done anything since this film that even touches how great this genre film was. By nature he is a cinematographer and I think that's interesting because this film is stunning to watch. Every shot, every scene, the pace and style of the movie is just brilliant. I can't express enough that this is THEE quintessential action flick. This is the sort of action flick you could watch again and again and still be thrilled by it every time because it is literally non-stop action from beginning to end. I rarely mention music when it comes to films but the music in Speed stays with you with this thumping beat and a great soundtrack. If you haven't seen Speed...you're missing out...because it defines action and you can find few films even close to being better. 9.5/10",9,2,4,14 January 2012
Live Free or Die Hard," Could they really bring back the greatest action series? HELL YES!!
","I am not a fan of sequels following decades of the previous installments. Why wait so long? That being said Live Free or Die Hard was probably my most anticipated film of 2007 because Bruce Willis and his portrayal of John McClane single handedly hammered out some of the best action films of the eighties and early nineties. But could they really do justice?? Could they really resurrect the character and the series and not make it forced and still do justice to the Die Hard name?? Oh hell yes they did!! Live Free or Die Hard is ALMOST everything I could have ever expected from a fourth installment 12 years after Die Hard With A Vengeance. It had it's faults, it couldn't be perfect but my gosh it came just about as close to perfection I could have even imagined. It exceeded my incredibly high expectations and sits now as the greatest of the summer blockbusters to date and certainly high above any of the myriad of sequels this year. Director Len Wiseman is fairly new to the direction game having only created the Underworld series but did so to greatness (especially the first one.) That being said I think Wiseman went out of his way to make sure Willis had a big say in everything and to make sure this Die Hard was right along par with any of the previous ones. One of Live Free's faults is the same as every other blockbuster 2007 film...it's TOO packed. These films are proving that there is such thing as too much of a good thing. Live Free or Die Hard is over the top adrenaline and packed full of fantastic stunts and explosions and one liners and everything the first three Die Hard films were known for times three. So it can be a little over whelming. The story (which I was concerned might be a little 'techy') actually worked perfectly and was the perfect 'new' story for John McLean to deal with because he was very out of place amongst this brand of terrorism but his cowboy ways still worked.Bruce Willis returns and blows the face off of anyone who thinks action exists without him and Die Hard. He brings John McClane back to the screen like he had never been away. I thought for sure he wouldn't be able to be the same character that was twenty years ago and he is...he's perfect!! Willis is still the action king!! Timothy Olyphant takes the helm as the lead terrorist with big shoes to fill following Alan Rickman, William Sadler, and Jeremy Irons as Die Hard bad guys and Olyphant is just awesome. He has that deviant evil look to him and that cold, unforgiving way about him. One of the most disappointing aspects of the film was the final battle between McClane and him because it was short and too quick and there wasn't a build up but still he is just awesome. Justin Long...what to say...I like the guy, I have liked him ever since Jeepers Creepers but I was scared to death what he would do as the sidekick to Willis in this film and it turns out he was awesome!! Long was the perfect opposite to McClane and made for a great sidekick and wasn't used so much that it became annoying. Instead he did an awesome job as the neurotic hacker turned good guy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also really surprised as the terrific Lucy Gennaro/McClane. She looked a lot like Bonnie Bedelia who played Holly McClane in previous installments. She also had the fire and wit that Willis brings to his role so she was perfect. Cliff Curtis was alright as the man on the other end of the walkie talkie and head agent in charge but he was a little dry for all the action and plot.What all the critics are saying is true...the film does run a little longer than necessary, and one of the most disappointing things was the delivery of McClane's infamous catch phrase 'Yippie Kayay Mother F%$#er' came too quickly and just seemed out of place and I waited the whole film to hear it delivered, it just wasn't right. The fight scenes were a little short especially the big battles but there was plenty of terrific and memorable one liners and action sequences that just make you wanna jump up and cheer including McClane shooting a fire extinguisher as a make shift bomb, an intense chopper vs police cruiser scene, Fighter Jet vs Semi truck and just McClane vs bad guys. Live Free or Die Hard is one of the best sequels I have ever seen and absolutely deserves the Die Hard name. Bruce Willis looked cut and copied right from the original Die Hards, he looks incredible, young and easily handles the action scenes and looks macho doing it. Blood soaked, cut and torn with that familiar faded brown muscle shirt. Witty quips oozing during every situation. This WAS DIE HARD!! Although unlikely I hope this completely reinvigorates the Die Hard Franchise and we see at least one more because this is the kind of kick ass hard core action flick the new millennium has yet to see. This was the throw back to the unstoppable action flicks of the eighties. I WILL see this again...and it's an instant action classic!! 10/10",10,4,11,27 June 2007
X2: X-Men United," Worthy sequel but understandably inferior to it's original
","X-men 2 is what most sequels end up being...most good sequels anyways. It relies heavily on opening up the story set by the original, plays heavily on the best characters from the original and adds in some new ones for good measure. Bryan Singer returns to the helm for the second installment and continues treating the series like his baby and meticulously lays everything out. Everyone from the original cast returns and they even come up with a well done, and interesting new storyline that forces the two mutant sides who were enemies in the original, to now work together. The action sequences in the film are quite intense or plentiful as they were in the original and some of the great characters get a bit of a toned down story in this one which is unfortunate.The entire main cast returns and they are still one of the best cast group in film history...especially Superhero films. Hugh Jackman is still basically the star and he's as good, if not even better than he was in the original. He doesn't do as much fighting but more of his story is explored. Everyone else in the film takes a rather toned down, back seat to Wolverine's story. In some ways this is a good thing and unfortunate in other ways. Whereas James Marsden's Cyclops seemed to be a terrific character with witty one liners and a great screen presence in the original, he's almost wrote right out of the second installment. He gets a couple of emotional scenes involving his love interest (the still very wooden Famke Janssen as Jean Grey) but his lack of tough leadership makes the emotional scenes seem out of place. The addition of some new characters are very welcomed and well done. Alan Cumming is brilliant and a great character as Nightcrawler. Seemingly a bad guy he turns out to be an amazing hero. Cumming's performance is great and I hope he returns in the future. The slightly increased role of Iceman played by Shawn Ashmore is decent and not overused thankfully. I think his young character could be easily an annoyance to the big action scenes. Brian Cox as the newest bad guy, William Stryker is good, although I don't know if he's good enough in the sense that he takes on some powerful adversaries including Magneto played brilliantly by Ian McKellen and Wolverine (Jackman.) X2 relies heavily on it's story and it's purpose is likely to bring together the original installment and the supposed final installment currently in theaters. As a story driven Superhero film it really works but after the non-stop intense battles and action scenes from the original you definitely feel the absence of the really big battles. Still that's not to deter you from an amazing series with a deeply rich character driven story. This is one series that is worth seeing absolutely, even if you're not familiar with the X-men of comics. You'll become familiar with them, Singer has done an incredible job thus far. 8/10",8,0,0,27 May 2006
Thor: The Dark World," Literally buries the first film and turns in one of the truly great sci-fi films of the year!
","I am sort of a wishy washy fan of the Marvel films. So far they have ranged from decent to really good and The Avengers was definitely the height of that and so far the best...until now. It is ironic because I actually thought Thor was one of the weakest of the Marvel films. It didn't really impress me although in watching it again I liked it more the second time. But Thor: The Dark World is simply stunning. Everything about this film works. It absolutely felt like The Avengers and had sort of that same action/comedy blend with a definitive focus on the action and the fantasy elements. Similar to the first most of the film takes place on Asgard or one of the other realms with some time on Earth but there was simply something more astounding about it this time. Superhero angle aside this was an incredible, stand alone science fiction film. There were actually certain aspects of the film that were reminiscent of Star Wars or had the world's feel to it and I mean that as a compliment. This isn't about a guy in tights saving people but rather a mythical warrior and the world around him. The special effects are jaw dropping and the battle scenes absolutely epic in stature.I think I am fast becoming a Chris Hemsworth fan. Earlier this year he blew me away in Ron Howard's Rush and he is truly larger than life as Thor. There is something undeniably charismatic about him and when he dons that Thor outfit with that ridiculous hammer he absolutely embodies the role. He commands the screen with a character who could be very silly and he has really found his groove since the first film. Natalie Portman returns as Thor's love interest. She is okay in the role. I really do like Portman and I think she's a terrific actress but somehow I can't latch onto her Jane Foster character. They have good chemistry and she gets some decent lines but she doesn't seem to be into it as much as she could be. Tom Hiddleston also returns as Loki in sort of an anti-hero capacity forced to work with his brother. Hemsworth and Hiddleston have a terrific chemistry opposite each other and they have emotionally powerful scenes in this that literally almost brought tears to my eyes...almost. Hiddleston is terrific as Loki and has gone back to more of the dark roots rather than the silly maniacal character from The Avengers. Anthony Hopkins is back again as Odin in a slightly bigger role. Who better to play the All Father than Hollywood legend Hopkins. He is terrific and he instantly adds a new level to the cast. Kat Dennings deserves mention in the supporting cast in a much bigger role than the first film. She is the comic relief and she does what she does best with her biting sarcasm. It is almost overused...almost. But instead it is just the right amount and her one liners had me laughing. Other worthwhile mentions in the supporting cast include Rene Russo, Idris Elba (LOVE his character and I think he could support his own film entirely,) Stellan Skarsgård and Jaimie Alexander all do exceptionally well. Our villain this time is played by Christopher Eccleston and he is definitely a worthy villain. He certainly looks the part and perhaps my only critique would be that they gave him a little more development and a little more personality.I never really understand how they choose directors. In this case you have Alan Taylor who comes almost entirely out of television to land one of the biggest films of the year. Not that there is anything wrong with that because he made a film that is clearly and definitively superior to the its original. Despite a few references to The Avengers, this is a stand alone movie that anyone can come into and enjoy. The scenery and special effects should be tops at the Oscars because it truly was amazing. I did see it in 3D though (as I always say) it was unnecessary. The special effects are good enough that 3D has nothing to do with it. The story is even better, the characters were amazing and I didn't want it to end when it was all over. It very clearly one of the best films I have seen this year and I was so pleased. Also watch for a great (and amusing) Captain America cameo. I keep thinking Marvel is seriously over-saturating the market with their films but if they keep at this quality than bring it on. 9.5/10",9,1,5,29 November 2013
Lucy," A fascinating thriller whose style overcomes its shortcomings
","Lucy was one of those films that I really wanted to see during its initial run but kept missing and putting off until it was gone from theatres. Finally I got the opportunity to see it and I'm happy to report that the anticipation did not ruin the film. It was an interesting thriller with plenty of action and it wasn't until long after the film was over I started to think about how ridiculously implausible the entire concept was and yet while the movie was on I never thought twice about it. The story and ideas and visual effects were good enough to make me believe everything it was giving me. I have always been a fan of Luc Besson films and this is no exception though I don't think it has quite the depth or intensity of some of his other work. I think the concept is excellent but the delivery might be just a little bit rushed and perhaps too much is covered in just one film. Still, for a straight up action flick it was worthwhile! My biggest beef with the film was towards the end when really the intensity should be at an all time high it felt like they struggled with ideas to continue the story. When they wrap it up you're left with more questions than answers and a bit of a feeling of being ripped off too.Scarlett Johansson is a mixed bag for a lot of people. She has done a lot of great films and this was a really good role for her. She spends most of her time as the super-being Lucy but she quickly makes you understand she is just an ordinary girl before it all happens to her. She makes the role believable and she plays it very well. Who can ever say anything bad about Morgan Freeman? The instant this guy joins a cast he adds credit to a film. Its because no matter how big or small the role he plays it well and has incredible charisma on screen. His role is fairly small in the film and I wanted to know more about him but he still was a welcome addition and his scenes opposite Johansson were particularly good. One of the most underused characters in the film and such a typical Luc Besson character (and I mean that in a good way!) is Amr Waked, the French cop who becomes Lucy's unwilling partner. He gives a solid performance in a few small scenes and he's completely underused. I could have watched a whole film with just him and Lucy but there is too much story here. Min-sik Choi is decent as the cold hearted brutal villain but he doesn't get a lot of screen time either.I guess I just enjoyed Lucy purely for its style. It is lacking in a few key areas and they could have made this really something. But you cannot deny Besson's style and as always his car chase scene was expertly crafted and just different enough to make sure it didn't feel like you had seen it before. He loves action and he loves a story that is just a little bit improbable. At first I didn't understand the 'artistic' flare of showing predatory animals or flashes of nature but the idea is to make you understand human emotions before watching a human being unlock 100% of their being. To say their brain doesn't really help with their improbable concept. Lucy taps into psychic abilities, mental abilities, physical abilities and spiritual abilities. However, because there is so much there to cover you're left having to fill in a lot of blanks. Still Lucy is fun to watch and while it likely won't stick with you long, it was entertaining enough for the time. 8/10",4,11,25,17 November 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," SPOILER FREE -- My two cents on what is certain to be one of the most talked about films...ever.
","THIS REVIEW IS SPOILER FREE--- Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Those five words will change cinema moving forward. It will likely topple Avatar being it has made almost 1 billion dollars in a week and hasn't even opened in China yet. It has rebooted a beloved franchise with a new director, new owners (Disney), new marketing, new technology and it has taken on the most veracious fan base ever known. And for the most part...it has blown away everything it has come up against. Critics love it, a lot of fans love it and there is mostly an outpouring of love and respect for what JJ Abrams has done with his beloved franchise. It's beloved to me too. It has always been a huge part of my movie watching life and some of the favourite films and definitely a part of my childhood so I was beyond excited to experience this. I had astronomical expectations like most people. I also chose to wait to review this until I had seen it twice because as many people have said...it gets even better subsequent viewings. The natural build up and hype inevitably mars your first viewing. Coming out of that I was prepared to say it was too long, too many holes and give it a solid 8. Coming out of my second viewing...I have to give it a 10. A 10 because it is the best film experience I've had this year even if it has its flaws. When something is this ambitious and this anticipated, you can find holes anywhere.I absolutely love that they went out and found virtual unknowns for the new leads. I also love that they are fantastic...mind blowing maybe. Charisma on screen and kick-butt chemistry together both romantically and action-wise. Daisy Ridley might be my latest Hollywood crush. They have found a star in this girl and she fits into the world like a round peg in a round hole. She is so easy to relate to and tough as nails and passionate about this role. In my world she would be Oscar worthy. Equally as impressive is John Boyega nails his role as an AWOL StormTrooper (a great side story in its own right) and he makes an equally terrific hero with room to grow much like Luke Skywalker was in A New Hope. Boyega and Ridley have some of the best buddy chemistry I've seen in years. Adam Driver is wickedly awesome as Kylo Ren. He might be a tad campy in some of his performance but it works and he comes across as spoiled brat in some ways and yet is evil to his core and his battle with Ridley is almost as epic as Skywalker vs Vader was. Oscar Issac has a small but important role and I really hope they elaborate more on him in the future because he has a distinctive old school Han Solo feel to him and I'd love to see him become more important to the story. Same with Lupita Nyong'o's much talked about but achingly small role as Maz Kanata. Andy Serkis does his usual incredible motion capture work bringing the mysterious Emperor Snoke to life. And then we have the return cast...Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker. Daniels and Baker and Hamill I'm not going to touch on in this review. It's great to see them back, they are back in their roles flawlessly enough said. I adore Harrison Ford, I've been a fan of his for decades and he has been in a definitive slump. I can tell you this is Ford's best film in years. I didn't think he could do it but Ford steps onto the screen and Han Solo is back in every way shape and form. He is mesmerizing and a commanding presence. He is fantastic. Carrie Fisher looks terrific and while she has a smaller role, she is still a welcomed addition and definitely has that air of Princess Leia she had thirty plus years ago. The old and the new cast blend together seamlessly and magic happens in front of us.Again, if this were my world, The Force Awakens would be nominated for Best Picture and JJ Abrams would be getting Best Director. I have now seen the film twice and there are scenes in this movie that are literally jaw dropping. People poke fun at his lens flare but he brings the Star Wars Universe to life like I thought no one could ever do since George Lucas. Abrams make it bigger, bolder, makes you feel like you are there and bleak planet is alive with danger and life and questions and mystery. Disney/Marvel and now Abrams has a knack for taking a single film and growing an entire Universe out of it for endless numbers of film to build on. In The Force Awakens alone there is probably 100 mysteries that could have films built off of it. The Force Awakens is magnificent, acting, entertainment, an experience like I haven't had in years at the movies. I would go again right now. The best reboot/remake I think I have ever seen. 10/10",Null,9,43,30 December 2015
RED," Rip roaring action great! Amazing cast, hilarious and fun!!
","As an enormous Bruce Willis fan I crave for his days of action greatness following some disappointing entries in his career as of late (Surrogates, Perfect Stranger, achingly small role in The Expendables) Red looked like it might bring back the action sarcasm Willis we all know and love. What I didn't expect was how truly great the cast was in its entirety. The story was perfect, the action was well placed and well done and I think Red came so close to being just one of the best action films of the last ten years. Regardless its shortcomings are easily overlooked because of how great and incredibly entertaining the film is. The cast even features a couple of actors who aren't usually on my top ten list who really impressed me but more on that later. The film was based on a graphic novel which I had never heard of but I don't think that matters at all because it made for a good movie. I read some reviews that said Red became too complex which I don't understand at all. I mean action movies are usually blamed for being too shallow and too much action and this film balances everything so incredibly well.Bruce Willis leads the cast as retired CIA agent Frank Moses (the perfect tough guy name.) Willis does what Willis does best...kill bad guys or anyone trying to kill him. Right from the very first scene we know that he is one talented dude retired or not. He channels the old Willis that commands attention on screen and has some great scenes (the best of which is shown in the trailer jumping out of the police car, firing at bad guys as the car swings around.) Mary-Louise Parker is probably the sore thumb of the team. I don't mean that badly because her and Willis have good chemistry and she does give the film a needed youth boost since she has a good decade between her and Willis although she looks much younger. She is good as the fish out of water customer service rep suddenly in with assassins. John Malkovich is sort of acting royalty but I have never been a huge fan. He's always been just too outside the box for me save for a few roles but in Red he is absolutely amazing. His quirky, funny, twisted Marvin Boggs is a role that fits him like a leather suit. He is absolutely perfect and I know I loved him from the moment he quips 'Get the pig' and proceed to carry around a stuffed pig. Helen Mirren jumps way out of her comfort zone to play a more subtle role but still very well done as a hit-woman with an eye for sniping. Her role isn't quite as brazen as the men but she adds class to the cast. Speaking of class Morgan Freeman is a Hollywood god to me. The man is amazing and I was so glad to see him as part of this cast and he has some good scenes. The unfortunate part is that he is the most underused actor on the cast. Finally Karl Urban does a great job as the young talented CIA Assassin charged with killing the RED team. He is excellent and him and Willis have some great chemistry in their scenes where they battle head to head.I expected that when I looked at Robert Schwentke's directing filmography that he would have some heavy action greats to his name but he doesn't!! He has some solid films behind him but nothing in true action fame. If you are an action fan but haven't seen Red you are doing yourself an injustice because Red has everything you could possibly want. I love a good action comedy that can pull it off well and Bruce Willis does that better than anyone using sarcasm and wit and just pure bad ass-ness. Red has it all and if they do sequelize it, it probably won't have the same clout as the original but I'm willing to see them all again because of how great they were!! A worthy addition to my collection. 8.5/10",8,1,1,14 March 2011
Flight," Certainly a critical darling. Well made drama with some pacing issues
","There are a few films releasing now that it is plain and simple they will receive the Oscar nods. I think Flight is certainly one of those. It reeks critics favourite. Strong cast, male lead that everyone loves, brilliantly talented film maker, and an ethical debate for the ages wrapped in a strong emotionally driven story. All those things including the fact that critics love it doesn't necessarily make it a good film. It is, however, a good film. I don't feel like its a great film but it is definitely good. The story is excellent but the pacing for the film just seems off. I think some better editing to bring the film down to even a tidy two hours would have been plenty. The massive 2 1/2 hour length was simply not necessary. I felt like there was a number of scenes that simply could have been avoided. As many reviewers pointed out, and even a lengthy thread in the forums, the opening scene where Nadine Velazquez walks around completely naked making sure we see her at every angle. It was gratuitous and completely pointless and I'm really surprised that Zemeckis bothered with the scene.I enjoy Denzel Washington. However, I often find his performances as of late very egotistical. Fortunately for him this particular role required exactly that. His character is a damaged, egotistical man with very little redemptive qualities. He really does a great job and will likely get an Oscar nod for it. Kelly Reilly is Washington's love interest and a recovering drug addict. She does alright although her performance lacks the same depth as Washington's does. They have good chemistry and I understand why her character was important and yet her entire story arc was more fodder that could have been cut or reduced significantly. Tamara Tunie does an excellent job in her role as a respected flight attendant. I would have liked to have seen more from her character. She was really great. Bruce Greenwood nails his performance as Washington's friend and mentor. The two of them play off each other easily and with excellence. Don Cheadle is very good as the straight laced brilliant lawyer. This is one character they should have spent more time on and gotten rid of some of the other filler. As much as I like John Goodman I thought he played one of the characters that was simply unnecessary.Robert Zemeckis is probably one of the most brilliant directors. He has created two of my favourite films of all time and a handful of other truly brilliant classics. This, in my opinion, was a far cry from a Zemeckis film. It was a powerful story and had some really moving moments but there just felt like so much there that didn't need to be. The pacing was simply off. The crash scene was intense and brilliant and so well done and parts of the film are extremely well done. It could have been huge and for me, entertainment wise, it was just good and falls short of really great. 7/10",7,1,1,30 November 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fond farewell to a legendary Hollywood series
","Ten years ago when Harry Potter started it was simply mind blowing. Chris Columbus at the helm created a world and characters unlike anything we had ever seen on screen. I have never read the books and probably never will but I have enjoyed every single instalment of the series in different ways. However, post Goblet of Fire I personally began to see a gradual reduction in quality and story and characters. I suppose as they built up to the climatic inevitable battle against Voldemort that the sub-stories and characters would have to take a cut but its unfortunate. However, this is the perfect time for the series to bow out gracefully.The main cast are still excellent in their roles. I don't think anyone was more born to play the three main kids than Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. We have watched them grow into their characters and it is excellent. It was also great to see in this instalment the blossoming of romance between Grint's Ron and Watson's Hermione. The unfortunate part of the Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 is that the amazing supporting characters take a huge back seat role. The amazing Robbie Coltrane is barely existent as one of my favourites, Hagrid. Same with Maggie Smith and even Alan Rickman as Snape takes a bit of a backseat and that's really unfortunate because they were the heart and soul of the series. Ralph Fiennes is still excellent as Lord Voldemort though the final climatic battle actually turned out to be one of the most anti-climatic things I've ever seen in cinema.What I mean is...8 films built up to this one climatic battle and its over in seconds and its not over in the way you would even expect. I don't mean to give anything away but this legendary literary and cinematic rivalry between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort ends in the silliest way. However, it was also kind of nice to see a much understated character like Neville Longbottom played excellent by Matthew Lewis get a shining moment in the series. My final complaint was the ending in which we zoom ahead 15-20 years later to see Harry, Ron and Hermione sending their own children to Hogwarts. I suppose its a lose lose situation because I would have been annoyed if they had gotten older actors to portray them but seeing these 20 something year old kids playing 40+ year old adults was silly and they looked silly doing it. This was still the perfect ending to a great series, some truly outstanding visual effects as always and it was terrific that it all came to a head back at Hogwarts. If you watch this make sure you watch them all in order because together the series warrants at least a solid 9/10 but this instalment is a fond farewell but not the best in the series. 8/10",8,0,1,29 December 2011
Unbroken," Gives you the meat and potatoes but forgot to heat them up
","I felt somehow vindicated when the first review on IMDb I saw was from a user who said exactly what I felt. This is a powerful and inspiring story but poorly adapted for the big screen. It is gritty and visually very disturbing with some potentially powerful scenes but it feels too harsh and lacks emotional depth or heart. It just has no warmth and I don't mean that story about a POW war camp should be warm and fuzzy but when you're trying to appeal to people's sense of hope and heroism and unbreakable spirit...don't just constantly show the torture. The characters are very underdeveloped and you need to relate to these guys. It is a powerful story and the acting is decent and the style is very good but the script...sort of sucks. You almost feel bad saying that because of the content of the story and I honestly assumed a film like this would be a surefire hit for me because I love War stories like Saving Private Ryan, WarHorse or The Book Thief. I kept waiting to feel something...whether it be anger or fear or hope or sadness but I just watched like I would watch a straight forward informative documentary. I just wanted more and this didn't provide it for me. Finally after two hours of the film you get one incredible scene that moved me. Why did it take so long to get there? Everyone who stars in this film is good. No one gives a terrible performance. The problem is that no one stands out on their own. All the POW's are the same, all the captors are the same and its a 2 1/2 hour ode to watching them go through torture. Jack O'Connell gives a good performance but I can't call it a leading performance because the character isn't given enough. We know he's an Olympian and showing us a few minor scenes from his childhood doesn't make us understand him any better. Domhnall Gleeson, Garrett Hedlund and Jai Courtney are good in their roles but I promise you unless you know these guys to see them you wouldn't be able to tell which role they played. That's how generic their characters are. I can't honestly say they even captured the brotherhood between them very well although it wasn't terrible. Takamasa Ishihara is okay as sort of the 'head' captor in the camp. This should be a pivotal and villainous role but it is as generic as the rest.Now it sounds like I'm trashing the film and I'm not entirely. I think I can completely understand what Angelina Jolie was trying to do with this film. As I said a couple of times, the way it is short is very nearly brilliant. Its so grey and depressing and gritty. The dust in the air and the damp, awful POW conditions are shown perfectly. I think she really focused all her energy on making that aspect of this story come to life. She wanted to make it feel real. But I think what an experienced film director would tell you is that you need more than that to connect with your audience. Even the score of the film wasn't grand enough to move you when it should. Jolie absolutely has an eye for artistic style but she needs to see the film from our perspective. I'm a little surprised the Coen Brothers helped write this script, although I've always thought they're a tad over-rated. They do know how to really show off some character depth so I'm not sure what happened here. Maybe I'm missing the point but I've been utterly, devastatingly moved by other World War 2 films and this one just sort of gave me a half decent story and then said goodbye. Average at best. 6/10",6,6,11,10 January 2015
The Purge," Disturbing and best of all unique, The Purge was worth the wait
","From the moment I saw the trailer for this I was riveting and intrigued. For one reason or another I wasn't able to see it in theatres so I was stoked to finally get to watch it on DVD. You could say my expectations were reasonably high and I had heard mostly good things. A lot of IMDb reviewers were really harping on the film and I do understand where some of there concerns come from but ultimately this film delivers exactly what you would expect from it so I'm not sure how anyone could dislike it so much. You absolutely have to let go of some semblance of reality and accept a few (mostly minor) plot holes but I was willing to do that for a number of reasons. First of all this was one of the first unique horror films I have seen in years. It is disturbing, twisted and has a sincere undertone of a bizarre moral message in there somewhere. The frantic, gritty and dark style the film is shot in works quite well and sets a tone that really gets under your skin and is genuinely creepy. It borders almost like a found footage style of movie in some ways but without using that completely tired way of shooting horror films. The acting isn't perfect, in fact in some ways I was wondering if star Ethan Hawke was purposely being campy but then I wonder if perhaps the way he acts is part of his character.Let me explain that statement. Hawke plays a devoted father who sells security systems to guard homes against the annual purge. He has made a fortune at doing it. He seems cocky and very very wooden throughout the film. I thought he almost came across as sociopathic in the way that his emotions felt fake. But I think maybe that was sort of the point to the character. He is someone who has chosen to continue to quell his emotions and not take part in the purge. He is ruthless in some aspects and yet seems to want nothing more than to protect his family. Maybe I'm over-analyzing his character but he was unlikeable in some aspects but I have to wonder if that was the point. It wasn't his best performance but it worked for the film. Lena Headey is his wife. I came to know Headey best as Sarah Connor in the Terminator TV Series and it was different seeing her in a very vulnerable role. She spends an awful lot of time crying and screaming and never really gets a lot of depth to her character. She does alright in the role but the chemistry is lacking slightly between her and Hawke and the rest of the family. Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder are their two children. They also do okay without being particularly outstanding. Both of them have their moments and unfortunately for Burkholder, his character makes such an enormously stupid movie in the first part of the film (which basically drives the entire movie) that you can't help but hate him for it. Edwin Hodge is the homeless man they find themselves inadvertently protecting. He does a good job and shows a lot of emotion but doesn't get a lot of character development for sure. Rhys Wakefield might be the juiciest role in the whole movie as the twisted and demented leader of the group outside their home. He is cold blooded, maniacal and insane and it works. He borders being a little bit campy but he is scary enough that it works.So the biggest problem that The Purge has is a sub-standard cast or at the very least, poorly developed characters. I can vouch that Hawke, Headey and Burkholder can act so it has to be their characters. The family dynamic is lacking and it should be such an important aspect of this film. Nonetheless the disturbing nature of the film is enough to truly get under your skin and freak you out. Part thriller and part horror it is certain to at least make you jump once and give you chills when you're watching a particularly disturbing scene and there are a few of those. It is brutally violent without being gory in the lease which is bizarre but also clever on their part. Director and writer James DeMonaco breaks my cardinal rule of directing his own writing work. While he did a decent job at this, I think a director with more experience could have crafted this into something spectacular. Don't get me wrong DeMonaco has created something significant here but it could have been perfected. There is a lot of story left untapped, who are the new founding fathers, how did the purge come about and why are people so completely accepting of it? No matter what you think of the film as a whole and there are some issues with it as I've laid out but you can't deny the creep factor and the unique idea behind this. Its simply unfortunate that it was polished and perfected. Mr. DeMonaco needs to find a new director to helm the sequel and we can get this train onto the right track!! 7/10",7,1,2,6 October 2013
Pitch Perfect," Brilliant, fun, sweet and sassy. Absolutely lives up to the hype!!
","When Pitch Perfect first came out every single person I spoke to raved about it. Even my wife saw it multiple times (a rarity for her) and loved it. So the bar was set very very high for when I finally sat down to watch it. Well, no matter how high your expectations Pitch Perfect will certainly meet and probably exceed them. Now don't get me wrong you have to know what you're going into. I've read reviews on here that trashed the film as though they had no idea they were heading into a film that is essentially a musical, a teen comedy and in some ways...yep...a Glee knockoff. In fact, Pitch Perfect blends together a lot of different films and TV Shows. I saw a little bit of Bring It On, 10 Things I Hate About You, Glee, Breakfast Club...it's a genre mix of very popular movies in the same genre and why the heck not? Those are all great movies/TV Shows. It adds its own flare and unique characters and enough so that you will laugh and be moved and you'll wanna groove to the unique soundtrack with various mash-ups. The film is just really well put together to appease even the most critical movie goers.I enjoy Anna Kendrick but have never really seen her in a role that truly impressed me. Well this role truly impressed me. It was very stereotypical and certainly not a huge leap for a decent actress and yet it was a different type of role for Kendrick and she made it her own and made her character fun and likable. Skylar Astin plays Kendrick's love interest Jesse. He was good, but not great. He wasn't on the calibre of similar roles in other teen flicks that I previously mentioned. The chemistry between the two of them is good but not outstanding. Brittany Snow is cute and funny and enjoyable as she usually is. This isn't a stretch for her but she's perfect doing what she does best. Anna Camp is the loud and demanding Aubrey. Her role is pretty straightforward for the genre film but she also fits it well and does perfectly. I heard so much about Rebel Wilson in this film and how hilarious she was. My concern would be that they would overuse her in her role (Jar Jar Binks syndrome) but I was completely wrong. She was awesome, very funny (apparently ad-libbed most of her lines) and she wasn't overused at all. She was outstanding just as everyone said. I wish I could mention everyone in the supporting cast but I simply don't have the space. Everyone played their role very well, and you will certainly easily find your favourite character amongst the misfits. I particularly enjoyed Hana Mae Lee as the quiet weird Asian girl Lilly. Adam Devine made a great pseudo-villain playing a very Jack Black type character (even looked and sounded like him.) I've used the word stereotypical a lot because this film is. Its very set in its genre and the characters are all very typical for this type of successful film. If they had broke the mold and done something even a little different, this would have been a HUGE 10/10. As it is, it is insanely fun, the music is just feel good and well performed and the cast works so well together that you can't help but fall in love with the whole zany bunch. I could have turned around and watched this again just as many people did in the theatre. Jason Moore who comes from Television but most importantly comes from Broadway instantly weaves together everything in a perfect little bow. The movie is fun and sassy and just a hoot to watch. Absolutely the perfect entertainment for something truly fun. 9/10",9,9,17,19 December 2012
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Legendary Horror comes to life with a deep story and blood and guts
","Slasher flicks are my favourite. The legendary ones like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare On Elm Street are legendary for a reason. They spawn multiple sequels, they have a memorable killer, and in this case they have an amazing story. I think where A Nightmare On Elm Street stands out on its own is because Wes Craven is a truly outstanding writer and creator and he didn't just rest on blood and guts and slashing teenagers but actually put a story behind this killer, a very real story, that could be explored in future instalments and actually makes the killer seem that much more disturbing. Also you have this really brilliant idea of a killer that kills in your dreams. Anything goes in dreams...Wes Craven single handedly got rid of any concern about whether something is believable or not because this killer is in their dreams. The only reality in dreams is what's happening. A hot young cast, a great director and the birth of one of the most chilling killers in history...Freddy Kreuger makes this truly memorable, fun, chilling, disturbing and just plain fun all at once.I always joke that star and scream queen Heather Langenkamp always lives up to her name...the 'kamp' part of it because every performance she does is campy. But at the same time she's cute and down to earth and somehow you relate to her but some of her emotions and expressions are bordering on hilarious but it works because her Nancy is the legendary scream queen of Nightmare. Johnny Depp in his premier role is recognizable and certainly has a handsome quality to him. He doesn't particularly stand out but he does a decent job and the chemistry between him and Langenkamp (his love interest) is sort of minimal. Other teenie fodder for death includes Amanda Wyss and Jsu Garcia, both of which do a good job but again nothing that will stand out. Depp, Wyss and Garcia are better than your average Friday the 13th victims because I think Craven gives characters more depth. John Saxon is actually one of my favourite Nightmare characters as Nancy's Dad and the no-nonsense Sheriff who buried Freddy's remains after killing him. Saxon gives a great performance in the small screen time he has but he really does stand out as a seasoned actor. Oh yes and of course Freddy Kreuger...the legend is brought to life by a legend in his own right Robert Englund. Certainly no one knows Freddy better than Englund and he makes him come to life in all his sarcastic, twisted, gory glory.I mean what can I say about writer and director Wes Craven. The man is a horror master and was even when this was created. The Hills Have Eyes and The Last House On The Left already set a bar for gore and disgust so this was tame compared to those. He simply created an iconic character, gave life to the other characters and made us believe this could happen. His story is timeless and creepy and the special effects, especially given the budget, are terrifying eerie. A Nightmare On Elm Street set the bar for horror flicks after it. It is more than a slasher, and while I feel like as I'm watching them all (I am making my way through the entire Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th series) the sequels to this fell off far faster than Friday the 13th, there is still a lot of greatness to be found in the original classic horror flick A Nightmare On Elm Street. 8.5/10",8,0,0,22 August 2011
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," The series continues and shines...for the most part
","The first Hunger Games was an amazing beginning to the series. I had read the first book but I still haven't read the second so I don't know how that effects my opinions of the film. One of things I noticed nearly immediately was how much more political this film felt. The pacing is a little slower than the first because we are already introduced to the main characters but the world around them is the focus now and we really get to see more of what is happening in this Capitol controlled dysotopian future and in each district. This goes far beyond the games we discovered in the first film. There are some definitively disturbing scenes early on that really lay the ground work for the revolution that builds the rest of the series. Returning to the games was both exciting and a little old hat all at once. I have to give the film makers credit for actually giving us a whole new experience inside The Hunger Games without making it feel like its re-hashing what we've already seen. There a few things in the film (and perhaps they are lifted right from the book) but some things felt a little too deus ex machinima for me. I could have done without water that miraculously made their boils and heat welts vanish from their skin. The poison fog was one of the best scenes and the way they solved everyone being covered in boils was to wash them away. But that is one scene that does nothing to detract from an incredible political epic that had me riveted by the end. This series has gone from action epic to something with a lot more depth.To say Jennifer Lawrence has exploded into Hollywood is a gross understatement. She is everywhere and for good reason. She is a talented and versatile actress and she completely embodies Katniss Everdeen. Her rise from the slums of District 12, and wanting to protect her sister to a symbol of hope and revolution is captivating and she is so terrific at it. Her range of emotions in this film is really impressive and this would not be the same without her. Josh Hutcherson also returns as Peeta. In my review of the first film I expressed my concern that he wasn't quite up to par compared to Lawrence and this second film emphasizes that. He is good in the role but not great and there are times you will wonder why Katniss fights so hard to protect Peeta because he is dead weight in that arena constantly getting himself into trouble. Still he's part of the series now and he does alright, I just think he's consistently the weak link in the cast. Everyone I wanted to get more screen time in the first film gets exactly that in the second which made me very happy. Woody Harrelson's brilliant portrayal of Haymitch is a little more subdued this time around but definitely gets more development. Liam Hemsworth is still terrific as Gale and his star crossed relationship with Lawrence is outstanding and they have great chemistry. Donald Sutherland is better than ever as President Snow who is now completely Katniss' adversary. Effie Trinket who is absolutely meant to be annoying is even moreso in the sequel played by Elizabeth Banks. I think they are trying to make her relatable but she really is irritating. The new tributes we are introduced to are all very good and add a lot to the story including Jack Quaid, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, Lynn Cohen and Jena Malone were some of my favourite performances. Phillip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast and he is a brilliant actor but his character is very back seat in this instalment. I supposed I expected more, I'm not sure why. I look forward to seeing where his character goes. I also have to mention Patrick St. Esprit who's character enters the story at a key moment in a very climactic fashion. However, St. Esprit overacts and actually comes across as campy in the role and its such an inappropriate and unfortunate spot for camp and he sort of drags down the scene. I am sure I am missing a few key players from this enormous cast but these were some of the major key roles I noticed for one reason or another. (I love Stanley Tucci in his role but its very, very brief this time around.) The Hunger Games series is fascinating because I really do believe it transcends just a youth's story about fight for her life. This has a lot of depth to it and it feels like the film makers in the first one and now this sequel are truly trying to make this series mean something. New to the director's chair is Francis Lawrence who has some terrific films with unique flare and style to his credit. I didn't quite see the level of darkness he could have brought to the story having seen his work in Constantine and I Am Legend but he absolutely knows the post-apocalyptic world and the way to really make things effective to the audience. He continues the story from the first but almost makes this one his own and that is impressive. Truly a terrific film and a worthy sequel that doesn't quite live up to the original but I'm not sure the book does either from what I understand. It is still entertaining, important and powerful in a number of ways and well worth your time to see both films in preparation for the third. (Terrific ending...albeit incredibly frustrating.) 8.5/10",8,0,15,6 December 2013
Godzilla," Interesting nod to the iconic monster but not altogether perfect
","I like to think I had moderate expectations when it came to this newest iteration of 'Godzilla.' I saw some people comparing it to Pacific Rim and excited because of that. I thought Pacific Rim was very near garbage so I was definitely hoping for more than that and I did indeed get more than that. There are some really good things about this summer blockbuster. The Special effects were very impressive. I wasn't annoyed or found myself rolling my eyes once at the CGI. That, in itself, is a miracle. The CGI and monsters and destruction were all excellent. I saw this in 3D IMAX and it was a lot of fun seeing it in that aspect. Another good thing is the fact that this hearkens back to the old school 70's and 80's 'Disaster films.' It introduces you to the characters, establishes the story and you feel the tension building as you know the disaster is coming. As many reviewers are saying the tension builds...verrrry slowly. It takes a long, long, long time to get to Godzilla. I'm all for establishing story but they do take too long to get around to what everyone is there to see. They do it well and the anticipation is good but its just a tad too long.The cast are all good. This is a bit of a con to the film. They are good...not great...in fact no one really stands out in the cast. The best of them would be Bryan Cranston in his first post-Breaking Bad role as a driven and obsessed scientist determined to convince people of the impending disaster. Cranston is very good and then...well...spoiler alert...they write him off like cheap trash. I was very nearly angry that they just completely cut him off from the film without any real good explanation and with very little emotion. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is really the focus of most of the movie and he is just okay at best. He's come a long way from KickAss fame but he just feels almost bored in the role and lacks the charisma to carry the movie. Elizabeth Olsen was so impressive early in her career with Martha Marcy Mae Marlene and then just seems to flap around looking for where she belongs ever since. She is sort of whiny and annoying in this and isn't in it much and the chemistry between her and Johnson is okay at best. One of the best roles and the least used was Ken Watanabe as Dr. Ishiro Serizawa. I would have rather he carried the entire film because at least he showed proper intensity. His only expression was intense fear and it worked for the most part.Surprisingly Gareth Edwards is fairly new to directing projects but he has a long history with special effects. He has created something that is impressive for a number of reasons besides the special effects. This iteration of Godzilla did what 1998's reboot did not even try to do and that is pay homage to the origins of this iconic character. Godzilla is inadvertently heroic, there are hidden easter eggs throughout (Mothra's tank for instance) and the fact that Godzilla is not pitted against the humans but rather other beasts and humans are just in the way. It is a massive battle unlike anything I have seen in a very long time. It was like Man Of Steel's hour or more long final battle only this made sense because you had several massive creatures destroying the city. Godzilla is ultimately pure fluff but it was entertaining and a great popcorn flick. It would be a great movie to see curled up in your car at the drive in. It was entertaining but lacked real depth and a good cast which holds it back from being truly great. I look forward to seeing a sequel but I expect this series will only struggle to really take off. 7/10",7,4,7,3 June 2014
Shall We Dance," A memorable Dance film
","Shall We Dance is the furthest thing from 'Romantic Comedy.' To explain it or put it in that genre seems silly and will therefore disappoint anyone who see this film. Shall We Dance is exactly what one would expect...a dance film. Dance films are their own genre beginning with the incredible Dirty Dancing and extending out with films such as Flashdance, Mad About Mambo, Footloose, Saturday Night Fever and so on and so on. Shall We Dance is the newest addition to the family and scores on that level.Director Peter Chelsom does a great job focusing on what is important in this film which is two things...emotion and dance. The emotion comes from the focus on the main character played by Richard Gere. He is sad, he is in the midst of a mid life crisis and despite his initial attraction to Jennifer Lopez's character the attraction is really just something different, something new and exciting which he finds in dance. Gere is really the focus of the film and he does a fantastic job. He's always charismatic and an incredible screen presence, and a great dancer. He's very different from the typical dance Genre star. He's not young (Gere is 55 years old and looks incredible) but they don't try to make him seem younger. For the first time since I can remember they match him with the perfect wife in Susan Sarandon. Their romance in beautiful and time testing and not perfect but they fit each other and have amazing chemistry.Jennifer Lopez is very subtly used in this film. Her character Paulina is a quiet, hidden, emotionally void dance instructor who was hurt in her past both professionally and romantically. Gere's fascination with her is more about the dance then about her. The woman is a beautiful dancer and fits her role nicely and although her and Gere don't share a lot of screen time, their chemistry is not stellar but then it's not meant to be. This is NOT a romance between them. This is about her bringing him to life. They do have one dance scene that is downright steamy and they look great together. The rest of the cast works so well together and they become such a great team that you can't help but feel like you're friends with all of them. Stanley Tucci is amazing as Link (he can also dance like nobodies business), Lisa Ann Walter is great as the annoying but emotional Bobbi, and Bobby Cannavale and Omar Benson Miller as Gere's friends and fellow students are also great additions. Everyone just seems to be having a good time, and they become such a great team together that they are fun to watch...like a family.The film doesn't try to be overly serious and it hits the mark for a dance film. There is some real emotions there and I think everyone will enjoy it for what it is. Ignore harsh critics and check it out!! It's a beautiful story. 8/10",8,0,1,4 September 2005
Looper," Why Looper was amazing...and why it wasn't
","As a HUGE Bruce Willis fan I was ecstatic to see Looper. I hoped this was a return to the sci-fi/action films that Willis excels at and in many ways it was exactly that. I can only say about Looper that at times I was just absolutely blown away by it and then in the same breath I felt disappointed in some aspects. I think a truly smart and savvy time travel flick should hurt your brain. It should inevitably leave paradox's that keep people talking about it for days or months after seeing it and Looper does that for certain. I tried to read a few of the forums on IMDb discussing the ins and outs of the intricacies of the film and it literally is mind numbing so kudos to them on that front. This is the type of film that I could sit down and debate/discuss with someone for hours and hours and have a great time doing it and for that reason I loved it. There were some incredible action sequences and an interesting look at a future world. Here comes the however...I felt certain scenes were inadvertently almost funny. I spotted some of the actors looking like they were preparing to take a punch or for the stunt to begin which is just poor directing and editing. Certainly there were plot holes (Willis carries the same gun after knocking out Levitt that he leaves laying beside Levitt in the scene before), and I think when you start to do the deconstruction of the film scene by scene you would find some glaring issues. However, I'm willing to forgive those inconsistencies because of the grandiose and brilliant idea of the film. Finally, the film represents itself as a simple story about Levitt chasing down Willis to try to rectify the fact that he lets him live. In fact the film is more about saving the future by killing a young boy who will become a dictator and madman.Bruce Willis is in full Bruce Willis mode for Looper. He doesn't start out strong but he finishes it in full form. At first I thought he seemed slow and bored with the role but then when the film climaxes I saw that flash of fire that Willis brings to a role. I never get tired of seeing him mow down bad guys with giants gun. Joseph Gordon-Levitt once again flexes his acting chops and proves why he is Hollywood's future. He carries the film flawlessly and I was a little skeptical about the whole idea of him trying to nail Willis' mannerisms and while he walks a very thin line of overdoing it, he does a pretty solid job. He is well on his way to being a superstar and it shows! I am growing a little weary of Emily Blunt being in everything. I don't particularly see that outstanding actor that some think she is but she is good in her role as the protective mother. I think there are many questions left unanswered about her character and she has good chemistry with Levitt, though I don't think it was great chemistry. She definitely holds her own. I enjoyed the villain role played by Noah Segan, and I kept waiting for his character to have this big revealing point in the story but he never did sadly. Still he was good but sort of underwhelming in the end. Jeff Daniels has a small role as the Looper boss but he is mostly underused. And finally what an incredible role played by young actor Pierce Gagnon who plays the young boy with a disturbed future ahead of him. He was fantastic and just played an incredible role and was so expressive in his emotions and lines. Keep your eyes out for him in future roles for certain.Writer and director Rian Johnson is a talented film maker. He has a distinctive dark and gritty style that he's brought to TV Show Breaking Bad and also his first film Brick. That style shows distinctly in Looper. I did feel like the 'present' time they showed was perhaps a little more advanced than what is realistically possible but its sci-fi for a reason and I did enjoy what they did. I think it also would have fascinating to see more of the future-future as we only saw a very very small glimpse through the eyes of Willis. Looper would have been a tough movie to make because I think there is years worth of material here that could be explored. No matter how you shake it, when a film is this intensive and grandiose there has to be some bad with the good. The final word from me is that the film is excellent, a top notch science fiction action flick that I will certainly get something different from every time I watch it and that is the mark of a great film. Be ready to think and be prepared to enjoy the ride. 8.5/10",8,1,4,10 October 2012
Life," Calling it a knockoff of Alien is being way too generous. Life is blah.
","I was hesitant to watch Life for a few reasons. I remember when it came out, I hardly saw any trailers and it has a strong cast and yet did very poorly. I knew there had to be a reason for that. I'm not sure how a film like this goes so poorly. All parts of it are things we've seen before. Space exploration, vivid personality crew, experts at what they do, find something weird, weird attacks them and picks them off, a few or two or one remaining finds a way to survive. But Life is so completely forgettable. Despite the charisma of the stars in the cast and some very weak attempts at making them seem human, I couldn't care less about any of them. Most of the time I was so bored I didn't care who was in it. Even the music seemed like it was the same little snippet over and over and over again trying to set tone. The special effects are okay although sometimes I thought their faces looked like you could practically see a green screen behind them. It gets marginally better once the practically faceless cast gets picked off but probably only because Jake Gyllenhaal has a lot of chemistry on screen. There is one good solid scene that was still only good because it was reminiscent of Alien. This film checks a ton of boxes for smart sci-fi horror and then doesn't deliver on any of them.So check out this cast. As mentioned you have Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds, Hiroyuki Sanada and Rebecca Ferguson in your main cast. Between them you might have one okay scene each. Gyllenhaal gets the most but only because he lasts longer than everyone else. It's honestly like watching a cheap slasher flick where people are picked off one by one but not even in a fun gory way. I don't even know what they're goal was behind the film. It's so brutally predictable and obvious with nothing new added to the genre. It feels like a stale remake of a hundred different Alien films and especially THEE Alien film itself.Director Daniel Espinosa is young and fairly new to Hollywood but he did alright with Safe House though I remember thinking then too that a more experienced director could have done more. He just doesn't seem to know what to do with a strong cast. Life is less than average and I was bored by the half way point. You could compare it to other films but it doesn't try nearly as hard as it should. It was a colossal disappointment with a few and I mean... minimal moments that caused me to look up and keep going instead of turning it off. 2/10",2,5,11,9 September 2017
Heat," Heat is exactly what it says...a crime saga...not your average action crime flick
","In many ways Michael Mann is the type of director who really does have his own style and flare. I can't honestly say I'm necessarily a fan but I think he really does try to make the audience feel his story, and bring them into it and then on top of that makes it a snazzy artistic film that people can look at and say 'Yep that's Michael Mann.' I hold a certain disdain for him since I paid and sat through the utter garbage that was Miami Vice but you couldn't deny he tried to make it feel real and sharp and gritty and Heat is the same way. He called it a 'crime saga' and there is no doubt that Heat packs a punch but is it for the right reasons? The film clocks in at nearly three hours which as much as I appreciate a good long film, it's far too long for this type of movie. There is plenty that could have been cut out to make the film move a little better but again Mann wants it a certain way. The film chronicles every detail of both sides of this fight...the criminal side and this little family of crooks and then the police unit trying to stop and catch them and then it goes into the details about the personal lives of the two leaders to (I believe) show us that the two men aren't different at all.The key to Heat being what it is are the two players in the game and this is the legendary and moving Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro in their first screen time together (they both starred in the Godfather 2 but never shared any screen time together.) I worship these two men, they acting gods and they don't disappoint in these roles. DeNiro is Neil McCauley, a life time thief who is brilliant at it and treats it like a major operation that it is complete with his tight knit crew. McCauley is cocky in some ways, egotistical and yet subtle and smooth. DeNiro is a sight to behold and does a great job. However between the two of them I have to give it up for the amazing Al Pacino who is mind blowingly good as Lt. Vincent Hanna whose passion for the job is bar none. Pacino's personal life is explored at length as we see how much he lives for this job and to stop McCauley like it's a personal vendetta for him. He's passionate and loud as Pacino always is but grips you to his scenes. The rest of the cast is just packed with stars of various talent and Hollywood status including Val Kilmer (underused but his character is still great,) Jon Voight (more of a cameo for him), Tom Sizemore (also underused), Amy Brenneman (terrific chemistry opposite DeNiro), Ashley Judd (really great performance), Dennis Haysbert (small role but really great and different for anyone used to seeing him on The Unit or 24), William Fichtner (small role but terrific as a slimy businessman), Natalie Portman (very, very small role), and Mykelti Williamson (always makes a good cop.) However you like at it, this ensemble cast was put together to support DeNiro and Pacino and they do that just fine.There is definitely some key moments in Heat and the first one is the cup of coffee that McCauley and Hannah sit down for. Here are these two Hollywood legends sitting and having a banter of wits over coffee and it's a terrific scene that can only be experienced. And then of course is the infamous bank heist scene that turns into a full scale war of M16's and automatic weapons that wraps the film up basically. I also thought it was well worth hanging in there to see the final cat and mouse game between Pacino and DeNiro which we've all wondered about and then to get to see right there on the screen. Despite the film running long which I understand he really was trying to make a saga of sorts and kudos to Mann for doing that...the film is worth seeing. I will say that I think it is a little over hyped considering it never did that well when it was released but only now has a cult following but it's still a powerful film to watch. 8/10",8,2,4,15 April 2008
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The patriarch of Science Fiction space masterpieces...begins the greatest series of all time
","I don't know when I first saw Star Wars but I know I never tire of seeing it again and again. I usually hate reviewing films that have this aura of absolute majesty around them with a fan base that is insane!! But I have no worries reviewing this and the subsequent sequels because this is one of my favorite movie series of all times. I am not a HUGE sci-fi fan but this film can appeal to every genre watcher in the world. Star Wars was so simply made, and carefully crafted, and gingerly put together by a man who had such deep passion for the story and everything he built from the ground up. The 'special effects' they used, the story, the characters, everything about it is the definition of timeless because it is as good now as it was more than three decades ago. The characters come to life, each and every one of them and the story leaves you riveted to every moment and throws this mysterious force of good against one of, if not thee, greatest villain in movie history. The film, I believe, has this deeper meaning, something that could actually be translated into modern day religion of belief systems and created one of the greatest pop culture references in the world.Who to start with in this cast...Mark Hamill IS Luke Skywalker. Now I will say openly Hamill is not a great actor. In fact his performance as Skywalker in the first film is a little cheesy and weak and even amateur. And yet still you become enamored with the young, naive Skywalker. Harrison Ford became a star and for good reason playing Space adventurer Han Solo. Ford exudes confidence and snide sarcasm and is the perfect hero. He has always been one of my favorite characters and subsequently one of my favorite actors. Carrie Fisher creates one of the greatest female heroines in film history. Her portrayal of sexy feisty Princess Leia is timeless. She is strong willed, and just as tough as the other male heroes but still exudes this terrific feminine sexy character. Her and Solo and their banter are fantastic. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew are just brilliant as their respective sidekick roles as C-3P0, R2D2, and Chewbacca. Baker and Mayhew do have a single English line in the film and create these lovable fantastic character and Daniels is a master at the comedy, sarcasm, and scared C3P0. The three of them become like a fantastic trio that is a must have in the film. David Prowse and James Earl Jones (as the infamous voice) play the evil Darth Vader. Vader doesn't really come full circle evil in this film but he is still one of the best villains in film history. This is only a small dip into Vader's character.George Lucas, the master and leader of all modern day nerds geeks and sci-fi lovers created this film with every ounce of his being. His labor of love shows through because the film is so delicately constructed. Even though the first film is not even the most epic, it has this feel of being so much bigger than what anyone could have dreamed. We know now what Star Wars and the world around it is all about but in 1977 this was all new and just the timeless, magic, immense feeling makes it all worth while. If there is any living person left who hasn't experienced Star Wars then you are missing out. It doesn't matter what your film likes or dislikes are...there is something for everyone in this film and there will inevitably be a character you fall in love with!! If only I could experience the film again in a theater. 9/10",9,0,0,16 February 2009
50_50," A sad example of what comedy and film making is becoming
","I did not hate this movie. Parts of it were absolutely excellent. However the crude and literally movie spoiling existence of Seth Rogen takes a touching and potentially heart wrenching movie into complete and utter crud. I read other reviews or hear what people have to say about this movie and I'm very confused. I hear that people bawled, and cried and found it moving and touching and there are a few moments that might make you feel that way but it is completely overshadowed by the filth they put into the movie. The language is appalling. I'm not a prude, and I can handle just about anything in a movie but when you get a movie like this...a potentially moving story about a young man diagnosed with cancer and how he deals with it, falls out of love, in love, and living with his friends and family. That should have been enough but apparently the film makers thought they should take a PG movie and turn it into an R rated Seth Rogen comedy blitz because it would sell better.Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a truly outstanding, brilliant performance as Adam, the twenty-something diagnosed with cancer. He gives an award worthy performance and again I have to say that what should have been an Oscar worthy performance is ruined by Rogen. The ironic thing is that Rogen, in real life, went through this with 50/50 creator Will Reiser. I guess you know what you're gonna get with Rogen but his character is annoying, stupid, unfunny, and of course absolutely disgusting and crude. He ruined this movie period. Anna Kendrick is good as the awkward and quiet new doctor trying to help Adam deal with his emotions. She has good chemistry with Gordon-Levitt and is charming. Bryce Dallas Howard is deliciously awful as Adam's girlfriend. She is just really a bad human being and you will love to hate her. This might be Howard's best role ever. I've never been a big fan but she plays bad really good. Anjelica Huston gives a solid performance as Adam's mother but they under-use her. I would have like to have seen more from her and more between her and Gordon-Levitt.I think its downright hilarious that Rogen himself, a producer on the film, thinks that 50/50 makes people uncomfortable because its a comedy about cancer. I constantly hear how they tackled cancer in a way no one has ever done before and guess what...that's a load of crap. I have yet to see a movie about cancer that tip toes around it. 50/50 is not breaking any new ground here no matter what the majority of the film makers and some reviewers will tell you. Yes it has moments of being a sweet story and some really powerful moments. A scene with Gordon-Levitt where he locks himself in the car and basically melts down is really particularly powerful. But then when you're being barraged by sex and bad language through the rest of it, it wears thin and ruins what could have been a truly powerful movie. See for yourself and find out what side of the fence you fall on...artistic film making brilliance or potential for powerful ruined by nasty humour. 7/10",7,0,1,21 February 2012
Deadpool," In many ways it is the piece de resistance of the Marvel Universe
","What did Deadpool do right? Very nearly everything. This might be the only 'Superhero' film since the genre exploded that is a true 100% labour of love. Ryan Reynolds and Tim Miller fought tooth and nail to make this film happen and make it happen the way they wanted it to and the way the fans wanted it to. Deadpool is insanely entertaining. It is ridiculously gratuitous in all the best ways you'd expect, it crosses into the X-Men World so it's a nice break from the whole 'Avengers' world although it gets mentioned as well. It is dark, twisted, hilarious, gory, unique, insane...every time I didn't think it could impress me more, it does! I was worried Reynolds' sarcastic humour would be overused and it isn't, I was worried it would have a weak story and it is anything but. Every expectation was met and no glowing review was wrong. This was quite simply a great time at the movies. It also has so much to it and the script is so fast and clever and with the pop culture references and Easter eggs I am certain I could watch this several times over and walk away with something different each time. It might have given gas to a genre (described by Steven Spielberg so accurately as the Western of this generation) that is slowly losing steam I think. Best of all they did it on a very moderate budget and yet the special effects, stunts and CGI are some of the best I have ever seen period. Nothing is held back.I have always liked Ryan Reynolds. I know he's a good solid actor because he's proved he can be versatile. However, he was born and bred to play Deadpool. It was like Deadpool was written with him in mind 20+ years ago. Hugh Jackman single-handedly made Wolverine come to life and now Reynolds does the same for DeadPool. But this isn't just a super-hero who kicks the crap out of people though he does plenty of that. There is an actual story here, Wade Wilson has some serious depth to his character and Reynolds is clearly very passionate about this character. In order to be this amazing character he needs a near perfect villain and they find that in Ed Skrein who is fantastic as Ajax. The two of them have a deep rivalry that works on a terrific level and unlike some villains who are out for world domination, this rivalry is personal. Morena Baccarin is decent as Wade Wilson's love interest. She wouldn't have been my first choice but I never cared for her on Homeland as a character so maybe I'm biased. She is still decent and their chemistry is solid. The supporting cast also truly shines in this film without characters you just want to see more of. Karan Soni, Stefan Kapicic, T.J. Miller and the excruciatingly underused but fascinating addition of Negasonic Teenage Warhead played perfectly by Brianna Hildebrand. This is also the first time I've seen Gina Carano who is just awful awful awful at 'acting' be tolerable in a role but mostly because she is reduced fortunately to a thug whose purpose is to fight with Colossus. Still Carano needs to stop getting cast in anything ever.Director Tim Miller really knocks this out of the park. Sometimes a new director proves themselves in such a way that they can set themselves for life and I think will be Miller's home-run. His style, the depth of story he's created here, the incredible special effects and the way he uses the characters and actors and he's just made something so incredibly deeply entertaining. This is one film that lives up to the hype and is a must see but is such a far cry from other Marvel films out there and definitely not for the youngsters. 9/10",9,4,15,7 March 2016
300," For the first blockbuster of the year...it gets a deserving thumbs up...not perfect but perfect for the red blooded movie goer
","300 has everything that you can expect going into it having seen trailers and the name 'Frank Miller' attached to it. As far as Epic Blockbusters go I am almost certain 300 is the most violent film I have laid eyes on. Whereas most historical battles whether fictionalized or based on reality imply more of the gruesome death and gore of battle 300 brings it to blazing life with brilliant well done CGI and over the top brutal effects right where you'd expect them to be. The film is a non-apoligetic blatant gore fest and satisfies every teenage males desire for blood. You sit there thinking...damn it'd be cool if his leg flew off and spun in the air with blood spurting...and the film makers said...yes, yes it would...so they did. Heads coming up, beasts of all kind being pierced and falling, arrows slicing through bodies like butter. All of this is done in the best possible way to fit the story but that's the major part where 300 fails is the story or lack thereof. I mean of course there is the necessary and fairly well known historical beginnings to Sparta and their 300 soldiers that hold back Xerxes until they can't anymore and are slaughtered but there is little story beyond that and 95% of the film is just one big constant battle. The film is not a historical epic by any means but Science fiction based on a historical event...hence the fictional fairy tale like creatures and mythology involved and even the Spartan fighting style was changed from realistic to completely different by the film makers in order to make it look better on screen. There was no attempt to make 300 appear historically accurate and that's okay but it will fall victim to those who want it to be.Gerard Butler is the well trained reigning King of Sparta Leonidas. As the King Butler is the perfect Alpha Male. Brutal and strong, and powerful and well spoken and respected and yet has this soft, romantic, gritty style to him. Butler has always been one of my favorite character actors and has had some really great and diverse roles and he is quite good in this role considering the story and character depth isn't great. Butler should be a bigger star and hopefully this enormous success will launch him further into the lime light. Lena Headey is his beloved Queen Gorgo who is also a very strong female considering the time of the film and masculinity in it. Rodrigo Santoro is absolutely fantastic as the evil leader of the Persians Xerxes. The very disappointing fact is that they completely underused him despite making him look like an absolute towering, evil, god-like monster. He spends maybe ten minutes on screen and you desperately want to see more of him and a battle directly between Santoro and Butler would have been incredible. The supporting cast are all very good in their respective roles but aside from a very few small story arcs the characters are not focused on in any great manner.That is truly 300's only and major downfall is the lack of any story or really major, enthralling epic plot. I mean, I realize that they made 300 to be exactly what it is...an enormous, gruesome, terrifying and artistically created masterpiece battle and they succeed in that 100%. You aren't likely to find another epic battle sequence like the ongoing one in this film and it's well worth seeing for that alone but I personally wanted so much more depth to it. I wanted more story, and more romance, and more characters with bigger stories. I wanted this to be the Spartan legacy that Lord Of The Rings was, or Braveheart and instead they made a mainstream action film with heads rolling. Nonetheless two weeks into release and well over 100 million dollars 300 is the first major smash success of 2007 and it truly is easy to see why. This film could be seen again and again and blow you away every time. Go see it on the big screen or the IMAX would be incredible!! 8/10",8,0,4,23 March 2007
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Be still my red blooded Male heart
","My subject heading is a little bit sexist. Women could easily enjoy this film too of course. I love action films but my heart lies in those unique, adult oriented, non-stop thrill rides that you rarely see anymore. I thought Kingsman looked interesting and I kept putting off seeing it because it wasn't at the top of my list but I kept hearing about how good it was so I finally got in to see it! Thee best movie I have seen in MONTHS maybe in a year or more. It is easily the best movie of the year thus far and I guarantee will land on my best of 2015 list. If you love action, spy, comedy, British humour and literally the most brilliant satire I have seen in years then here it is. Kingsman is brutally violent, stunningly action packed and full of the most bizarre humour and campy scenes that you simply don't expect. I have no doubt there are a lot of people that simply won't get the satire or spoof qualities because we are so used to the brain numbing spoof films like Scary Movie etc. Kingsman features one of the greatest scenes in action film history (the Church scene with Colin Firth) and while it channels something like Kill Bill, it stands alone on its own merits and I hope and pray we see more from this as a franchise.Colin Firth is an A-List actor but for me he's always been sort of just there. He was terrific in The King's Speech and he's been good in other things but he's never floored me by any means...until now. He is absolutely riveting as superspy Harry Hart. He kicks some serious a$$ and literally proved he has serious chops in the action genre. Taron Egerton is fairly new to the big screen but he really nails this part. I wouldn't even necessarily say he leads the cast because he is almost second to Firth but you can see him rising up and taking the lead in this series. Egerton still plays the role very well as a street smart, trouble maker with exception skills. This kid is definitely going to be one to watch in Hollywood. Samuel L Jackson is our villain Valentine. Now I am sort of to the point now where I am almost tired of seeing Jackson show up in literally everything. He is a terrific actor with a lot of charisma but he is really pushing the too much of a good thing envelope. So I sighed a little when I realized he was the villain. Guess what? I was wrong. He is absolutely perfect. Not only does he spoof every great Bond villain with style and look and that ridiculous lisp but he has some incredible one liners and is a great adversary for our heroes. Another terrific thing about the film is the supporting cast. Michael Caine is amazing, Mark Strong (I could watch a whole film on his character alone!), Jonno Davies, Mark Hamill, Velibor Topic, and Sofia Boutella (in a ridiculous and yet amazing henchman role.) There are also some underused characters that I hope they bring back in future sequels.For the most part director Matthew Vaughan has really impressed as a director. There is only one film of his I haven't seen and I think he has terrific vision when it comes to mainstream action flicks. He makes everything seem extravagant and over the top and just fun to watch. I feel like he really showcases his talent here for story telling and cinematography and just imagination to the utmost. Kingsman is insanely fun and actually very intelligent to boot. This is the action film I've been waiting to see for ages and I will absolutely add it to my collection and look forward to seeing it again! Kingsman is a blast!! Bravo to all involved 10/10",10,4,10,14 April 2015
Cube," Riveting, odd, complex, out of the ordinary!!
","Cube is perhaps one of the most unique films I have seen in a long time. Part of it's charm is that it has a very amateur film type quality to it. The story is very simple, and the cast very small and the setting so simplistic that to keep this film interesting would be such an enormous challenge and the fact that director and co-writer Vincenzo Natali pulled that off is a representation to how great a director he could be.Cube is never dull, and never slows down, and keeps you on the edge of your seat despite it's setting and small cast. The entire film takes place in various rooms, all basically the same, but different colors inside a much larger Cube, so they believe. Seven strangers find themselves locked into this maze of rooms and mechanisms and doors for no reason and seemingly no point. Each character discovers they have a different purpose for being there, a fate or destiny. The whole cast does a great job showing a variety of emotions particularly lead actor Maurice Dean Wint who plays the anti-hero/bad guy Quentin. He seems to be the sane reasonable one but by the end is the horribly crazed psychotic killer. It shows his downward spiral into insanity while being trapped in these spaces. The rest of the cast is no less great in their perspective roles. I was disappointed to see brilliant character actor Wayne Robson get killed off so early in the film. He has been around for such a long time and seemed to have such an interesting character but barely lasted any amount of time, although his death was very cool!! In fact the film is quite gory and the enormous variety of traps set in different rooms also gives you a serious sense of suspense and on the edge of your seat. The special effects are quite stunning considering such a low budget film. Cube brings out the fears in the human mind and each character shows a different range of emotions caused by this situation and setting. This makes the film very riveting and impossible not to watch. Unfortunately the film does leave you more than slightly unsatisfied with no real answer to any of the major questions. The plot really never thickens and never has a climax or an end. I hope that perhaps the following sequels to the film tie up some of that but by the sounds of it they really don't. They created something incredibly unique with this film and it's worth seeing just to see something completely out of the norm but still very compelling. I just think there was more story there to tell definitely. Check it out!! 8.5/10",8,4,7,11 August 2005
The Hangover Part III," I had high hopes...definitely time to say farewell.
","The first Hangover is one of my favourite guilty pleasure comedies. It is the ultimate in hilarious, raunchy, buddy films and I thought a second one would likely be a disaster. Well, imagine my surprise when I felt like The Hangover 2 was as good as the original and another hilarious romp with the Wolf Pack. So I had high expectations for this third film. I thought if they managed to squeeze two great movies out of a one movie story then just maybe they could do it again. Well, I will give them an A for effort. I do think they honestly tried. But for the most part it feels like they lost focus of nearly every single thing that made the first two films so terrific. I'm not even sure where the comedy was to this third part. The film is incredibly dark compared to the first two. It is gritty and violent and almost disturbing and not in a shocking funny way. I felt like I was searching for somewhere to laugh and not finding it. It was depressing and twisted and didn't fit the tone of the film. The film practically opens with an animal being decapitated, the death of a character's father, a person is shot to death, someone has a serious drug problem, there is an intervention....and it seems to go on from there.The three main guys in The Hangover had undeniable chemistry in the first two movies. They seemed to just completely embody these hilarious characters each with their own unique flare and quirks. Bradley Cooper has always been the leader of the pack and just the likable popular guy. In The Hangover 3 he seems almost dark and bored and almost looks depressed. He doesn't even have half the charisma he had previously and that is so unfortunate. Ed Helms who was always my favourite as the lovable dentist with the worst luck. Helms seems to have lost all that lovability and bickers with Zach Galifianakis in a really mean spirited way and I didn't like the chemistry between these three guys who previously were just so amazing together. Galifianakis returns as the iconic Alan, only this time he's off his meds (depressing), drug addicted (sad), and more psychotic than funny. Justin Bartha returns doing the same thing he did in the first films so he gets off easy. He's barely a supporting character and gets the same amount of lines as previously. John Goodman is our villain this time around and he's good. I mean Goodman is almost always good but man his character is dark. He shoots a guy dead in the chest and is a great mobster but he could easily be in an action flick. Ken Jeong also returns and I was always afraid they would overuse him in the first two films but they didn't. Well now they have rectified my fears and overused him. As much as I enjoy him in Community, he is obnoxious and just way too in your face in this third one. Watch for other returning cameos like Heather Graham, Mike Epps and Jeffrey Tambor. Melissa McCarthy also makes a cameo appearance in an okay role but nothing terrific.The good news is that the film isn't a total disaster. There is some definite old school Hangover vibe to the scene where Alan and Phil break into the penthouse suite at Caesars Palace (easily the best scene in the film.) Todd Phillips returns to finish off his trilogy but I'm just really surprised he let the film go into such dark waters. Also in a bizarre turn of events there were a few scenes of blatant CGI that were done pretty poorly (the giraffe, a parachuting scene.) If I had to guess I would say that Phillips felt rushed to release this or even pressured by the studios. It was just missing so much of what made The Hangover the iconic comedy that it is. Certainly the best scenes were back in Vegas and the latter half of the film was so much better than the first (but still incredibly dark.) They tried to wrap up the series by making reference to previous adventures but it felt forced. This wasn't The Hangover and I was thoroughly disappointed in so many ways. If you're going to experience The Hangover then stick with the first two. The Hangover 3 was a DARK, TWISTED, and nearly depressing end to the trilogy. 6/10",6,0,3,4 October 2013
Easy A," A clever, fun, risqué teen comedy. One of the better with great performances!!
","Easy A seems to have solidly placed its star Emma Stone into the Hollywood eye. And for good reason. Any one who is a fan of good solid funny, fun entertaining teen movies will absolutely love Easy A. Is it a chick flick? Yes definitely but anyone can enjoy the humour!! A solid cast of young hot up and comers (a few TV stars on hiatus I'm sure) but has a perfect mix of cheeky humour, sarcasm, physical comedy and mistaken undertones. Now all this doesn't equal a family friendly film. The lead characters are all in college and there is plenty of rough language and taboo talk to keep adult movie goers happy and laughing but with none of the stupid toilet humour of a Judd Apatow film (not that that type of humour is always a bad thing but it usually is.) This was writer Bert Royal's first entry into big time screenplay writing and he hits it out of the park. Cheeky wild humour will literally keep you laughing and sometimes its roll in the aisles funny. This is one of those occasions where a cast just works really well together and while I always pictured Emma Stone as being a little too geeky for this kind of movie she absolutely nails it and looks great doing it.Emma Stone plays Olive, who just wants to get noticed and at the same time decides to conduct something of an experiment in woman's promiscuity. Stone is geeky and silly but has tons of heart and she will win you over with this film hence why she got so much notice for it including a bit of a surprising Golden Globe nomination. She won't be supporting characters any more I am certain. Penn Badgley of Gossip Girl is the guy next door that loves Olive. He is perfect for playing the guy next door but his character might be almost a little too understated. He's quiet and a little withdrawn and his chemistry with Stone is just a little awkward. I love Amanda Bynes. I think she was on the path to being a brilliant comedienne but somewhere she hit a hiccup. She does a decent job as the snooty, and uppity nemesis to Stone's Olive but I sort of expected more from her and missed seeing her in the lead role. Dan Byrd (Cougar Town fame) is really good as Olive's friend and first 'client' so to speak. He doesn't have a big role but he is great in the role he has. Thomas Haden Church and Lisa Kudrow have good supporting roles in the film as Professors. They both have some really funny scenes. Two of the best cameos in the film are by the hilarious Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson who play Olive's liberal parents. The dinner table scene with the three of them is absolutely hilarious and classic!! Alyson Michalka (Hellcats) is Olive's best friend and she does well playing the role she is given. I think her role is very stereotypical so they don't give her a lot of room to act.The late teen, early twenty demographic that this is aimed at love Television. Especially those cult shows that adults wonder how they stay on the air...you know anything on the CW so it makes sense that they would haul in those young hot TV Stars. But they don't give them a lot instead leaving it up to Emma Stone and the cameos from bigger film stars. Director Will Gluck seems to be a popular choice for this class of film given his first movie was Fired Up! which I have yet to see. I have a feeling this film has a little more intelligence behind it. Regardless he clearly knows how to make the teen comedy flourish and he put together a solid cast and this wins its target audience clearly. Easy A is the absolutely perfect date movie and men won't cringe to sit through this because everyone will laugh and enjoy how silly it is. Check this one out and do yourself a favour!! 8/10",8,0,0,6 February 2011
Fast Five," Action movie for the ages
","I have been wondering for a long time why we don't see the action films we used to. I miss the 80's and 90's and Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and so on. Imagine my surprise when I found that action genre right here. Fast and Furious rebooted this franchise and turned it into a heist/action/racing genre hybrid that is unbeatable at the box office. It's also interesting that so far every other of these films is great and every other of these films is okay. The Fast and The Furious was great, 2 Fast was okay, Tokyo Drift was great, Fast and Furious was okay and now we have Fast 5. Adding Dwayne Johnson to anything nowadays seems to make it a surefire hit and it's easy to see why. This guy has unbelievable charisma on screen and he's quite simply bad ass. You place him next to and against Vin Diesel and action fans will drool. Add into that, some of the craziest, most incredible stunt and action scenes and you've got one of the most rip roaringly entertaining films I've ever seen. I see some reviews that talk about realism and plot holes (characters without any damage after suffering fights etc.) . but this genre of action is one that suspends belief if the story and performances are good enough and they are!! Fast 5 will not make you ponder life or love but it will leave you breathless and completely entertained. Jaw dropping scenes literally because I found myself watching with my mouth open during some of the more intense scenes. The train heist will forever be one of my favorite action sequences. An amazing piece of work. 9/10",9,2,3,27 April 2019
Honey," Surprisingly Watchable
","Honey was a film I hadn't heard much about. A few people had mentioned it if only as a passing Jessica Alba conversation. It took me some time to actually sit down and watch it but I was pleasantly surprised. I admit I am not a fan of hip hop music which was a big reason I hadn't bothered to see it.Honey is the story of dancer and nighttime bartender Honey Daniels. She dreams of making it big in the world of dancing and she has the moves but hasn't been discovered yet. By chance she is noticed by big time music video director Michael Ellis who launches her career by putting her front and center in some of the biggest music videos in the industry. As her fame grows she loses touch with some of the things most important to her, her neighborhood, her best friend, the kids she used to teach dance too. She tries to juggle both but it becomes a challenge. Ellis introduces her into choreography and she begins to write the dance moves and further her fame. Finally she finds a balance when she realizes she might be able to help get some of her neighborhood kids off the street by putting them in music videos. Unfortunately she quickly discovers Michael Ellis never wanted her for anything more than sex and he fires her when she doesn't give it up and on top of that blacklists her in the industry so no one will work with her. She returns to her neighborhood where she discovers the drop in center where she taught dance has closed and now she desperately wants to open up a dance studio where the kids can dance and have fun safely off the streets. In order to raise the money to buy the space for the dancer center Honey organizes a huge dance show with the kids performing. With the help from her neighborhood and the kids she will succeed in all her dreams.Any hip hop fan will appreciate this film from cameos alone. The film is chock full of musical cameos from Missy Elliot to Jadakiss. It's true that plot is a little thin in the film but quite frankly it was much more of a plot than I thought it would be. I had the film pegged as a Flashdance, Save The Last Dance type but it was less about the dancer and more about her love for the kids. It was actually rather uplifting and their final song of the film was very cool and made me smile. I've read some less than favorable reviews on this movie but for me it came as a surprise that it wasn't horrible. The cast is alright but they don't really hold up the movie as much as the story does. Jessica Alba is decent in the lead role, and Lil' Romeo does a great job in his role as Benny, the troubled kid from the streets. It doesn't have a lot of depth but if you enjoy hip hop and want something uplifting, it's worth seeing. 7/10",7,14,17,9 June 2005
Fantastic Four," They pull it off...this time...
","I know that this review will likely infuriate many Fantastic Four fans but I don't mean to insult or offend it's just my opinion which is how this works. Fantastic Four are not your typical super heroes. They are more kid oriented and their powers are almost cartoony so taking them live action would be much more of a challenge than something like Batman, Spiderman, or even Superman. Enter the newest film by director Tim Story. He goes for more of a balanced mix between campy, dark humor, and real live action trying to humanize the heroes as best he can.Fantastic Four is about former Nasa scientist Reed Richards and his best friend pilot Ben Grimm. Richard's has gone bankrupt and needs funding for his next project. In order to do that he turns to a former adversary, Victor Von Doom. He pitches him the idea of studying DNA in space in order to get a better understanding of it. Doom agrees if only to get 75% of the all the profits. Planning the trip into space is the lovely, and former girlfriend of Richards, Sue Storm. The two clash from the moment they meet again. Sue insists that her womanizing, off the handle brother Johnny Storm pilot the ship with Ben sitting co-pilot, an idea Ben is not crazy about. The five of them head into space and they must set up their equipment before getting hit by a cosmic storm which they will be protected from inside the ship. The storm is estimated to be nine hours away but suddenly as Ben goes outside the ship to set up equipment they discover the storm has shifted and is not minutes away. The team rush to get Ben back in the ship but it's too late and Ben takes a direct hit from the Cosmic storm and the rest of them, including Victor are exposed as well. When they return to Earth they seem fine but gradually slowly discover that they're DNA has been fundamentally altered giving each of them extraordinary powers. Ben Grimm goes through a horrible metamorphosis and is turned into an enormous solid rock creature and loses all human features. Devastated he escapes the compound to go home to his wife and when his wife turns her back on him he goes away to think. Unfortunately his appearance and strength causes some commotion on a bridge and accidents ensue. The team use their newly found powers to work and save people and they go from nobodies to celebrities overnight. Johnny Storm loves it, he embraces it, but the rest of the team only want to hide away and find a cure to their powers. The media name them The Fantastic Four and Johnny gives them all their super hero names. Unfortunately Victor Von Doom has cracked under the pressure of the newly found powers and the failure of his company and has become Dr. Doom. Doom wishes to destroy Reed and his team leaving him the only one who will be Fantastic.As with most original Superhero films this covers the basics, where they came from and their beginnings. It's fun to watch the team fight amongst each other until they get a handle on their powers. There is a slightly different tone to this film because basically the only evil being fought is the man who wants to destroy them. It's more about self defense than it is about defending the world. For an action film it lacked as many action scenes as I would thought but nonetheless is quite captivating and has a great story. Parts are very campy but they fit well and I think Story meant it to be that way. The cast...Ioan Gruffudd, as Reed Richards. He does a decent job and he has a very leadership quality to him although his character wasn't as depthy as it could have been. There was a passiveness to him that slowly broke out with his powers but they never really covered it. The biggest name of the film really, Jessica Alba also did the best job. As Sue Storm she was outspoken, and intelligent and did one of the better acting jobs. I think a role like this could really give her the breakout she needs. Chris Evans was almost overused. His obnoxiousness poured through and despite some funny one-liners he needs to be toned down for the future. As an actor he's okay but needs to find his niche. Michael Chiklis did an incredible job as both Ben Grimm and The Thing. The story didn't go much into his true emotional state and how he felt about losing everything but when they did touch on it, he did decent. Julian McMahon as the evil Dr. Doom did an incredible job. He was viciously evil and they gave him the space and events to be a little more than PG which was nice for such an evil character. Frankly I think any future installments to the Fantastic Four will be a downward spiral. As much as I would love to see Doom come back and do some more world domination evil, it would be tough to carry on the story in a watchable manner. I think in fact Tim Story was lucky enough to pull this one off which is quite watchable and amusing. If you love the Marvel comic books or even just Superhero films it's worth seeing, maybe they'll leave it with this one (cough yeah right cough cough) 7.5/10",7,1,3,3 August 2005
The Great Escape," Strange feelings about this film...read on...
","How can a film that I first of all never saw until yesterday, that I laughed at in the first 45 minutes because of inconsistent, unrealistic and blatant comedy and scenes, be a classic that by the end of it all...I absolutely was in love with?? This film has some magical powers and one of those powers is an ensemble cast that when spoke about really gets the short end of the stick. Steve McQueen is always hailed as the story and his name is always attached to this film and yet he isn't the star. He's a big part of it sure and his name was the big attraction back in 1963 but what makes The Great Escape is the incredible ensemble cast that each play their vitally important role and create these memorable classic characters. The problem with The Great Escape is first and foremost...it's not really a Great Escape. Fifty Men are shot and killed, and what like one man finally escapes and possibly not even him?? 250 Escape (although it looks more like 50 TOPS when the Escape finally happens,) and all of them are recaptured and the film ends where it begins. It seems so anti climatic. On top of that is this truly a truthful look at a German POW Camp in Germany?? These men arrive at the camp looking Healthy, vibrant, strong, clean cut, and professional to a place that is better than Summer Camps that I went to. Gardening?? Baseball?? Cooking?? Drawing Classes?? Ummm...yeah...I admit I was never in a German POW Camp but I'm regretting it now having seen these wonderful conditions. Yes I know it can be argued that one man is shot trying to escape and later on the Gestapo murders 50 escapees but their time in the camp prior to this is pretty nice. The Germans practically hand them the tools and time they need to prep for escape even after knowing that the men are going to attempt escape they are hardly guarded, never looked in on and are allowed everywhere within the camp and left alone frequently. It's absurd!! So all this being said why am I thinking about the film right now and how incredible it was and how it's now one of my favorites?? MAGIC!! The film a cold hard classic and it just embodies, action, comedy, real characters that are brought to live with some great performance.Let's talk about Mr. Steve McQueen since he is commonly considering the star. We rarely see him for about the first hour of the film. His role as Capt. Hilts 'The Cooler King' is good but small in comparison to some of the others. McQueen is strong and a little bit sarcastic and kind of funny in some roles and he appears to be a great leading man along the same lines as Kevin Costner or even Clint Eastwood...his characters don't change much and yet he is vibrant on screen. One of my truly favorite performances is by James Garner who plays Lt. Hendley. Hendley is a lead of sorts and people come to him to get things...any thing. Hendley comes across as trustworthy, determined, and a real hero of sorts. He's a great character!! Garner is terrific!! The terrific Richard Attenborough is the actual leader of the Escape Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett. Although I don't think Bartlett as a character is particularly likable he does a good job of organizing the team. Attenborough is a strong leader and ups the ante of the cast. Terrific in his role is Donald Pleasence who plays the very suave and likable Colin Blythe. His and James Garner's characters have unusual but very good chemistry together as they share a room together. A truly great performance is given often badly rated actor Charles Bronson who plays quiet and emotional Danny Velinski, who despite his title of Tunnel King is petrified of enclosed spaces. An aspect only made known far into the film. Despite that fact that it probably should have been established early on his performance because it's quite a credible and powerful performance. I have seen many, many Bronson films and this is one of his best!! Together this crew and the others I did not mention but still play great roles if not slightly smaller meld together and create a riveting story of friendship and team work to escape this camp although I'm not sure why they'd want to. McQueen's character who is usually labeled as the star forces his way into different scenes and the actors who portray the other scenes are good enough to hold their own but McQueen was 'the star.' I still must insist on the rather unbelievable aspects of this being a WW2 film but even still the tension, suspense, story and comedy just draws you in. The famous and well shot motorcycle scenes with McQueen do certainly add for some great action but also do feel a little forced giving McQueen scenes to show off in. Truly what makes The Great Escape a classic can barely be explained in a review or in words at all. The Great Escape is a film that just stands the test of time, endears itself to you and is captivating to watch and I do stand by that the incredible cast and interesting characters are a huge part of that. If you haven't seen this movie you must because it's cinematic history. A huge film with an even bigger following!! 9/10",9,1,2,22 July 2006
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Continues to be better than the first but still a travesty in acting
","What can I say about Eclipse that I didn't already cover in Twilight and New Moon. This is no different than those two films and my comments on them will be identical. So really you can look up my reviews for those two movies and find out exactly how I feel about this one. Literally nothing has changed. The story is perhaps a little better with a new killer victimizing the people of Forks. The action is better than the first and about the same as New Moon as well so if you preferred New Moon over Twilight than this one will keep you equally as entertained.I'm not going to go into great deal with the cast. Everyone is the same as they have always been in the series. I will say that Robert Pattinson gives a slightly better performance than ever before. He is still creepy (and not in a good way) obsessive, melodramatic but its toned down just a little bit. Kristen Stewart's Bella is perhaps a little one dimensional in Eclipse compared to previous films but it does feel like she is maturing as a character.Yet another director takes over, David Slade, who comes to us from music videos and you can see that style especially in some of the fight sequences. The special effects are a little better than ever before which is a good sign. Basically this series gets just a little better with each instalment but at the same time it will never become a 'good' movie. Despite that the series has generated over a billion dollars so who am I to speak but it speaks testament to good marketing and mass hysteria because this is a B-Movie at best and completely ignorable for the most part. 7/10",7,2,8,15 January 2012
Click," Absolutely stunning...a comedic, dramatic, touching achievement. A MUST SEE!!
","Click looked good from the minute I saw the first trailer. I had no idea how good it would turn out to be. To say that Adam Sandler's acting choices and films have matured is the understatement of the decade. We have seen a gradual progression of stupid, idiotic comedy (ie: Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore) to much more mature, intelligent, laugh out loud comedies (ie: The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and even Mr. Deeds.) Click is the epitome of what he has to offer. The jokes are good fun...it even manages to throw in the stupid humor that audiences seem to love, fart jokes, dog-sex jokes, ridiculous things and still manages to crank out this desperately sincere message that will literally bring tears to your eyes it is so heartfelt. It is easily comparable to A Christmas Carol or It's A Wonderful Life with a moral message about treasuring each and every moment with those you love. It is the feel good film of the year hands down, you will leave the theater with such a smile on your face and really be thinking about the message. I might even go so far as to say that this is the best film I have seen all year, definitely this summer so far.Adam Sandler delivers his best performance to date period. He plays brilliant architect and workaholic Michael Newman who also has the best home life and doesn't even realize it. Beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home, nice parents...everything. Sandler plays the 'Scrooge' half of his character to a 'T' He's an all around ass. He yells at his kids, fights with his wife, does everything he can to avoid anything that doesn't further his work. The film progresses his character at a perfect pace until he finally realizes what he's missing out on. By the time he's aging and dying he's missed everything that is truly important. If you don't have tears in your eyes as he lays in the rain on the street dying in his son's arms...you're made of stone. Kate Beckinsale is a beauty in this film. She plays Sandler's wife Donna Newman and as he points out in the film she really is out of his league and yet they make a great couple, even when they are at each other's throat. And they have a beautiful, real romance that transcends time and even divorce. Beckinsale plays off of Sandler's brilliant performance and supports him in every way and she does a good job herself playing the mother and wife all at once. She's a little subtle in most scenes but she is there and makes an impression. Irrepresible Christopher Walken plays mysterious Morty, the man behind the remote. He has done some brilliant comedy as of late (Blast From The Past, Wedding Crashers) and this is no exception. He has a style so unique and he automatically ups the ante of any cast. Him and Sandler play well together and he's perfect for the role. David Hasselhoff really leaves his campy acting behind him to take on a role where I think he really gives up the ego to make fun of himself. He plays Sandler's overbearing obnoxious boss who always ends up getting made fun of and some of the best scenes are with him being made to look like a fool but still he does a terrific job. This might really open doors for him in the comedy bits. I laughed to tears during the 'sexual harassment' speech. Henry Winkler, Sean Astin, and Jennifer Coolidge plays great smaller roles that really do add to the script. Winkler plays Sandler's Dad and does a great job as such. Also definitely worth mentioning is the young actors that plays Sandler's kids. Joseph Castanon plays his son Ben at 7 and gets the most screen time out of the Ben character. He really does a terrific job playing opposite Sandler. Adorable Tatum McCann plays his daughter Samantha and does just as good a job especially when they are feeling the absence of their father in their lives.Director Frank Coraci who also directed one of my Sandler favorites The Wedding Singer but also did Sandler's The Waterboy probably is getting to know his style pretty good. He definitely has a way with subtle comedy, a little darker than your average laugh out loud knee-slapper but has a very real style to his films. It's so hard to explain a movie that is genuinely funny, you'll be laughing out loud and at the same time such a moving and powerful movie with such a nice message. I admit that a lot of the funny scenes are definitely used up in the trailer but still funny to see. I also think I would have liked to have seen more of a wrap up in the end...seen him go to his boss and quit or do something. Nonetheless I haven't felt this good leaving the theater in MONTHS!! It is absolutely THEE movie to see right now, take your special somebody, your family, your kids (although there is a fair bit of bad language and sexual innuendos) I will watch Click again and again. AMAZING!! Happy 21st to my girl Sarah who I took to see Click and we both loved it!! Happy Birthday baby!! 10/10",10,5,16,23 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," They do strike back and make the best sequel in film history
","After the success of Star Wars I think I might have expected a slip if they took it to a sequel but apparently George Lucas' love for this world trumped film making curses for bad sequels. The Empire Strikes Back brings back the incredible original heroes, gives them even more depth and story and still finds time to bring in new timeless characters that become legends in their own right. Even with a new director at the helm, Irvin Kershner, the story and the world that made the first Star Wars so incredible is in tact and even better. The only problem really with the first Star Wars is it felt like only the beginning. Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character.I already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. Mark Hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. His naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a Jedi and an adult. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of 'don't mess with a good thing.' Solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. Carrie Fisher slips back into her role as the feisty Princess flawlessly. This time the banter and romantic tension between Fisher and Ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew return in full form as C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca and they are better than ever. David Prowse with James Earl Jones providing the voice continues to make Darth Vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. Vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the Empire. Billy Dee Williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. He plays gambler, scoundrel Lando Calrissian. He doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. And saving the best for last...the master of the Star Wars Universe. Frank Oz brings Master Yoda to life. The entire sequence with Luke and Yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. Yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. Pretty good for a puppet.The Empire Strikes Back is just simply non stop. The film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. This is ultimately all about the evil Empire and Vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. Starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of Hoth, and continuing on to a show down between Skywalker and Vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. The direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. There is simply no way you can watch just one Star Wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, The Empire Strikes Back will floor you!! One of the greatest sequels of all time. 10/10",10,3,6,16 February 2009
Inside Llewyn Davis," Definitely made for the critics but misses its mark with me
","Something about Inside Llewyn Davis appealed to me. I saw a few trailers and I was actually really excited about it. I knew it would be quirky, maybe a little bizarre and certainly anything but mainstream. I was okay with that. I know that the Coen Brothers are often an acquired taste but they have an absolutely distinct style that I have enjoyed before. So I suppose my expectations were reasonably high. Simply put, I was let down. The film tries to show us a week in the life of a struggling musician in the Greenwich Village circa 1961. The biggest issue I found with the film is everyone is so damn miserable and unlikable and that especially goes for our main character. How can you care or be intrigued by a guy who is an absolutely selfish deplorable and miserable all the time. Then he visits his close friends who are also selfish, deplorable and miserable and then you get a little folk song here and there. It was extremely disappointing. Its a bizarre little adventure and parts of it were reasonably entertaining but it continually falls apart. The music (which should be the backbone to this film) is haunting and lovely but just when you start to get involved in the music, it ends and there simply isn't enough of it. Why do we invest time into a struggling musician who is a horrible person and hates his own existence? There is certainly nothing wrong with the performances in the film. Oscar Isaac is our title character and he does the role well. The character is simply awful and unlikable and he does that well. I really wanted to see him find some redemption and it feels like its moving towards that but then the film ends...in the most sudden and abrupt way I have ever seen. Still Isaac is fine in a poorly written role. Carey Mulligan is also good at being a really awful human being. The entire story of their brief romance and pregnancy is ridiculous and their hateful, spite filled banter makes no sense. Her completely misdirected anger is irritating and her character is literally a bitch. I don't know what they were aiming for with her but she is awful but Mulligan plays that awful person well. Supporting cast are all decent and most of them have very small brief but important roles. Some worth mentioning are Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Ethan Phillips, Robin Bartlett, Adam Driver and Garrett Hedlund. Also honourable mention to those darn cats that he chases all over.I understand that this is meant heart and soul to be an art-house film and I'm okay with that. But I have a problem with film makers specifically go out of their way to be bizarre, artsy and ambiguous. Sometimes its nice to not have to decipher every single scene in the film. What does the cat mean? What does the music mean? What is the meaning of his life? Its okay to ask these questions but the entire backbone of the film are these ambiguous questions. If you look below at the IMDb threads 99% of them start with 'What ___ means...' 'Deciphering the cat...' Sometimes that isn't enjoyable. Sometimes you just want an entertaining, nice story. Parts of this show some remnants of being an interesting quirky little comedy but then it quickly falls apart into trying to be deliberately artistic. It is what it is and some people (mostly critics) seem to adore it. I personally think it was a disappointing experience at best. Did not fulfil my expectations. 5.5/10",5,13,22,19 February 2014
Sin City," Unique and WAY OUT there!!
","I knew NOTHING of Frank Miller, or his graphic novels but this film was packed full of Hollywood elite including one of my faves in Bruce Willis. If nothing else can be said about this film it's UNIQUE!! There is little to nothing else like it in it's style. It's perhaps one of the most intriguing comic book adaptations. It had it's shortcomings, in my opinion, but I found myself just glued to my seat completely captivated by it's look and style and even the over the top confusing story.To describe the plot of Sin City would be more confusing than it's worth. Sin City is a collection of interwoven stories focusing on three main characters played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, and Mickey Rourke. The film basically aims to immerse you in Sin City's world, it doesn't attempt to bring you up to speed, or give you any background but literally drops you into the action and lives of these characters. Bruce Willis is a cop who thwarts a kidnapping committed by a senator's son and goes to prison for a crime that he didn't commit. Upon release he is determined to protect the girl that was kidnapped 11 years earlier. Mickey Rourke plays a messed up thug who's true loves dies in bed with him and he hell bent on vengeance for her murder and Clive Owen plays a ladies man photographer who, together with his lady friend, kills the cities finest and most corrupt cop and must cover it up to stop the gang war of all gang wars between Cops, Mob and the ladies.Interwoven throughout these plots are other subplots that at times make no sense but they aren't meant to really. The first sign of confusion is the direction team...any time you have Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino together you've got one confusing mish mashed film. Fortunately for Sin City, it has the backing of an amazing cast, and drop dead amazing special effects and probably the support of Frank Miller to stop it from being say...Pulp Fiction (yes I hated Pulp Fiction, get over it.) The film is also brutally Tarantino violent although it's more artistic than gory being on the black and white backdrop. All three main stars are brilliant, dark, creepy, and watchable. Mickey Rourke is the shining point as the brooding, misunderstood hulk of a man Marv. He's mean, he's huge and yet you can't help but feel sympathetic for him. It's the best role I've ever seen Rourke in and he's barely recognizable as Marv. The downsides are indeed the mish mashed plot because there just isn't anything memorable about how it plays out. It's too confusing even with the upsides. Not all of us, probably a majority haven't read the graphic novels so we know nothing about it. The film leaves us wanting more back story which might be a nice play to turn this into a franchise but I felt like I wanted Sin City to be a TV Series so there was more immediately. Kudos to casting for bringing together some of Hollywood's biggest stars they all did well. I hope to see more of Sin City in the future so I can find out more of the intriguing back story.7/10",7,0,1,24 April 2005
The Ugly Truth," Crude, cute, funny...you'll howl and love the chemistry
","The Ugly Truth is quite simply hilarious. Any comedy that doesn't just make me laugh but at least once during the course of the film makes me howl into tears deserves seeing for anyone. The Ugly Truth is the perfect 'R' rated comedy. There is plenty of crude jokes, plenty of sexually hilarious moments, and it never overdoes either of these things which is a customary mistake for the Judd Apatow/Will Ferrell comedy world. Certainly the chemistry for the cast helps carry the plot amazingly. The entire character of Mike Chadway is brilliant and only the perfect actor could carry it and pull it off. Chadway as a character is a complete pig. The lines he delivers, the things he gets caught in are completely sexist and disgusting and yet the story writers had to make sure that Chadway became a lovable and charismatic guy that men wanna be because he's a good guy, and women love him because he changed and he's hot. So the film makers managed to nail the perfect guy for the role and him and the rest of the cast carry off the comedy absolutely perfectly. There is a little bit of every type of comedy...physical comedy (which I love when performed well), one liners, dry humor and hilarious double entendre comedy.The perfect guy I mentioned? Well that is 300 star Gerard Butler. How versatile is this guy? He is the perfect pig and even while he's being a pig, you love the guy. Then you love him even more as the story unfolds and he changes and falls in love. He is charismatic and hilarious. The beautiful Katherine Heigl plays high powered TV executive Abby Richter. Heigl might be concerned about being type casted on Grey's Anatomy but her roles in film as of late don't help matters as she usually plays the same powerful but scatter brained woman looking for love. Still Heigl is adorable enough to pull it off and her chemistry in this film works and best of all her and Butler are phenomenal together and have the perfect banter back and forth that keeps the movie going. Eric Winter is the object of Heigl's affections. Unfortunately for Winter his character has virtually no depth. He is supposed to look good, play into Heigl's comedy and do nothing else and he does exactly that which doesn't fare well for an actor. The supporting cast all do great but no one person particularly stands out or does any more than the two leads.Given the experience coming from director Robert Luketic. In particular I am referring to his original three films that embody romantic comedy. The adorable classic Legally Blonde, the zany and more intelligent Win A Date With Tad Hamilton and finally the (in my opinion) completely under rated Monster-In-Law. All three of those films have something uniquely common with The Ugly Truth. Character. Luketic obviously has a way of bringing out the best in a character and you just really relate and you feel like you know them and care about them making everything they do more entertaining and essentially more funny. The Ugly Truth is truly the perfect date movie because guys and girls will love it!! Guys will love Butler in all his masculine glory being as filthy as possible and the crude humor is the best!! And girls will love Heigl's strong female lead who loves guys and essentially changes her man into Mr. Perfect. Check out The Ugly Truth for a good time!! 8/10",8,0,5,25 August 2009
The Cabin in the Woods," Fantastic twist to the horror genre, a bucket load of fun!!
","I had heard very mixed opinions about Cabin In The Woods but fans like me always bank on Joss Whedon. He may not have directed the film but he clearly had a very heavy hand in the film because it reeks of Whedon and it rocks!! Cabin In The Woods takes the stereo typical often tired old horror genre and kicks it straight in the jewels. You could watch this film a hundred times and see something else...an homage to any number of horror films or little hidden easter eggs in the background of multiple scenes. You can easily find a little bit of every major horror film of the last twenty or more years in this movie. But it doesn't just spoof them and toss them aside, it weaves an intricate well told almost sci-fi story with solid performances, tongue in cheek humour, and a well made very old school ending and an INCREDIBLE evil villain cameo that made me cheer out loud (yes I'm that lame.) Is it a perfect movie? No. It did cram an awful lot into one movie and the old school ending may definitely come across as hokey to some but the movie is simply fun and thrilling and extremely entertaining.When I first saw Chris Hemsworth in Thor I immediately thought he was a one note actor who would never really go beyond Thor/Avengers but I admit right now I was wrong. I've seen him now in this and Snow White and The Huntsman and it turns out he was great in both. In this film he plays the jock type teen (who isn't even close to being a teen) and he plays the role well. He spoofs the characters but still makes it serious enough. Kristen Connolly is our scream queen, the 'virginal' pure girl who always survives. She plays the role perfectly. She is sweet and nice but toughens up when it comes down to it. Anna Hutchison is the 'hot blonde' of the group. She doesn't last long against the killers but then she isn't supposed to either. She serves her purpose though and her and Hemsworth have good chemistry. Fran Kranz (a Whedon-ite formerly of Dollhouse) plays stoner Marty. He was probably my favourite character because he was clearly smarter than the average horror flick stoner and surprises you in the end. He has great on screen charisma too. Jesse Williams (who I enjoy a lot on Grey's Anatomy is just okay in the nice guy role. He has good chemistry with Connolly but he is very underused and background fodder when it comes down to it. And finally I very much enjoyed the performances by Richard Jenkins and Bradley Whitford. Their dialogue with each other is perfect and keeps the pace going and they have some of the best, funniest and most clever lines in the film. Of course you also have the big bad cameo at the end but I won't mention who that is...except I was thrilled.This was director Drew Goddard's directorial debut and I don't mean to downplay the job he did but its very clear that Joss Whedon guided him a great deal. I don't know why he just didn't direct it himself. Either way it was very well directed and written by Goddard and Whedon together. Part of the film felt like an old school slasher flick like Friday the 13th but back when the series was in its stride, when it was truly excellent. Then you have a sci-fi feel to some of it, similar to that of the Resident Evil franchise, but you also have an original unique story that is done in its own way. Do yourself a favour horror fans and check this one out now!! 9/10",9,1,4,16 September 2012
Coach Carter," Typical, done before, but excellent nonetheless
","Coach Carter is not new. We saw it with Dangerous Minds, we've seen it with numerous other films...the teacher who touches the lives of all his difficult students with his unique style. But this format doesn't make a film bad, on the contrary, it's a heart felt concept that could work very well and Coach Carter is no exception.Coach Carter is the story of Ken Carter, a man who takes a job coaching an inner city basketball team that he played for in his youth, who's academic records barely exist. The kids are in trouble, they come from hard backgrounds and are into drug dealing, and fighting and basically they only come to school to play Ball. Carter is tough right from the beginning, having come from the school himself, he knows what must be done. The students have never had this kind of control over them and they gradually begin to see Carter's rules and style is going to help them win Basketball but more importantly save their lives.Samuel L. Jackson shows an amazing amount of heart in this movie, something he doesn't usually show. I thought he was much too rough around the edges to perform in a film like this but I was wrong. His rough around the edges style is broken through with heart and passion which is perfect for this role. The best part of the film in my opinion was the detachment from one key part of this teacher helping the students formula and that was that nothing horribly bad happened to any of the students. They had rough lives but there was nothing horrible that shakes them all up ie. Death, drug overdose etc etc. Perhaps this being based on a true story assisted in that. Instead the film keeps it's high moral message and gives us a glimpse into what was truly accomplished. Jackson as Carter never falters on his morals or what he wants to do and he fights the system for these kids and that's the most touching part of the film. He teaches them that win or lose their lives will never be worth losing because of a lack of self respect. This film is touching and gritty and a definite keeper.8/10",Null,0,1,22 February 2005
Happy Feet," Funny, moral, bright, cheery, thrilling and brilliantly created...Happy Feet scores!!
","Now I don't quite think Happy Feet is the feat of animation that some other Pixar or Disney classic films have been but nonetheless for it's time and place it is a wonderful kids movie. I think it loses some of it's points because it doesn't necessarily try to prove itself to the wide demographic like many other animated stories do as of late but even still kids and adults of all ages can enjoy Happy Feet on a different level. Happy Feet is almost heavy laden with it's moralistic message of acceptance, being different and those you love and there is NOTHING wrong with that. The characters are adorable and enjoyable and the remade classic Penguin tunes from classic rock to modern day gangster rap is deliciously funny and different and I might also mention that Happy Feet just screams Broadway show mark my words!! Veteran but sparse director George Miller takes the helm and does a remarkable job with animation and mixing a few small scenes of live action to create this vivid and thrilling animated ride. I would have loved to have seen Happy Feet in an IMAX because there is some truly stunning moments.Elijah Wood is the voice of the lead non-singing but tap dancing penguin Mumble. His timid and shy voice is perfect Mumble and suits him very well. Mumble's character is a small package but a big hero waiting to escape and loves and accepts everyone even when they don't do the same for him. Brittany Murphy is Gloria, Mumble's childhood sweetheart who loves him unconditionally but they hide their feelings for each other. Murphy's recognizable animated style (King Of The Hill, Good Boy!) adds some experience and great talent to the character and to the story line. Hugh Jackman is also excellent as the Elvis singing Dad who is devastated to learn his neglect might have caused his son some damage being unable to sing. Jackman's voice is almost unrecognizable with this southern drawl but he does a great job. Nicole Kidman is the voice of Mumble's mother and I'm sure it has nothing to with her performance but the character is quite small and timid and barely has anything of any significance to say. She's almost barely a supporting character. Robin Williams as he so often does completely steals the show as both Penguin Prophet Lovelace and the swinging Mexican sounding party animal Ramone. His crazy antics always tend to steal the scene and he gets some great lines too. Happy Feet has some scenes of true awe where your mouth will fall open at the glorious animation or thrilling action scenes and most of the music scenes are downright hilarious and touching. The characters are cute and the moral is as well and that is only my shortcoming. That's not to say I have ANYTHING against a strong moral message or cute characters but I am reviewing it from the perspective of an adult and as such I found it a little too cute and the characters for the most part were a little on the empty side. Negatives aside Happy Feet is brilliant and well worth seeing for all of it's positives which is plenty!! Go see it and take little ones. 8.5/10",8,3,4,25 December 2006
Her," Boy I really have to eat my words on this one....easily one of the most unique films of 2013
","When I first saw a trailer for this film I actually was angry. I looked around waiting for people in the theatre to start laughing because surely this was a mock trailer. The entire premise was ridiculous and the trailer looked outrageously awful. If this hadn't gotten a best picture nomination (still thought somebody was fooling me) I wouldn't have even bothered watching it but my annual custom is to watch all the best picture nominees at least. Well...Mr. Jonze I owe you a sincere apology. This film caught me WAY off guard and ended up being a beautiful, artistic, unique, wonderful, heart wrenching film that is one of the outside the box romance films I have ever seen. It is beautifully shot and the little details that probably could go under the radar make this very nearly breath taking. People always complain there is no originality in Hollywood...well here it is. This is firmly planted in the romance genre and is unlike anything else ever made. Set in the (relatively) near future, the style of the world around our main character is perfectly crafted. Shot in Shanghai which stands in for future LA, the buildings, the bleak surroundings, the style of clothing (the men all seem to wear very high waist pants) and just little details immerse you in this man's world so that the idea of becoming romantically attached to an operating system doesn't only seem plausible, but you root for it!! The underlying message of acceptance and just the idea of the arc of this relationship being no different than human-human is brilliant.Joaquin Phoenix is an odd sort of guy. He often takes roles outside of the box and just seems a little quirky himself so this role is a perfect fit for him. His awkward and brooding, sad Theodore makes you fall for him and understand him as the film unfolds. His questions about life and relationships give this film its backbone and more importantly its heart. Its a very subtle performance probably too subtle to get noticed but its a performance that absolutely grows on you. I loved this cast! Scarlett Johansson is absolutely amazing in this role as nothing more than the voice of 'Samantha', the operating system Phoenix falls for. She does more with her voice developing the character, making you feel empathy for her and just making her character come to life than most do in person. I personally think, given the role, she deserved an Oscar nomination for what she manages to do. You don't see her for an instant and yet she is the perfect female lead. I don't dislike Amy Adams, I don't think, but I find that she has over-saturating herself like few others. She is in EVERYTHING and everything she does she gets heralded for an I'm sick of hearing it. I've never seen her in anything that really blew me away. Now, that being said I actually enjoyed her performance in this. Its a small role and she is dressed down and has a sad tone to her. Somehow she fits into Theodore's life very well and I actually wanted to know more about her character. She did very well in a thankfully small role. Rooney Mara, who I do think is an amazing actress, also did very well in a role that is quite small and has very little dialogue. She impressively creates a lot of depth to her character with no words (the complete opposite of Johansson.) Mara and Phoenix have great chemistry and their relationship falling apart, mirroring his current relationship with Samantha is heart breaking.I won't ever forget this movie because of its uniqueness. As I said earlier, its the little details that you notice. Even the ridiculous game that he plays (which adds a great deal of comedy to the scene) is believable and disturbing to watch because it could become an actual reality. There is some comedy to the film but its few and far between and its a dark comedy. There is a distinctive sad tone to the film and many other reviewers call the film 'hauntingly melancholy' and I like that description because its so true. Its been a long time since I saw a movie that felt so heavy in a lot of ways. I was just a shade away from almost tearing up at one point and that is when I had to stop and say 'Wow.' A film about a man and a computer sharing a romantic relationship and I'm feeling their emotions. Jonze deserves accolades for this!! I kept wondering how they would wrap up this story and I admit I was a little disappointed. There was something cut and dry about it and maybe even a little forced but I can't imagine how hard it would have been to wrap up this sort of film. Absolutely see this especially if you love style because this film is full of style but also substance and passion and you will not find anything else out there like this. I eat my words happily Mr. Jonze, thanks for sharing your talent. 9/10",9,2,4,20 February 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," An insane post-apocalyptic opera...possibly a masterpiece?
","I honestly expected to walk out of Mad Max: Fury Road giving it a 10. I rarely hand out tens (went all last year without a single one) and this is now my second. The critics love Mad Max, fans love Mad Max...the buzz has been terrific. The reason behind it? They did everything right. This is not a 'reboot' (I HATE that expression) or a remake. It can fit in the previous Mad Max incantations, stand on its own or be open to interpretation (a fan rumour suggests Max in this film is not even the same Max as Mel Gibson's.) They didn't hire a new director or writer etc etc...instead the studio heads let the master himself come back 35 years later and redefine his vision. There are easter eggs throughout the film that connect this movie to The Road Warrior, the Mad Max world and sets itself apart. The bleak wasteland is so intricately created that half of the time your jaw is dropping at the sheer insanity in front of you. Does it make sense? Does it need to? What has happened to these people to make them completely insane? It is science fiction-post apocalyptic-action madness. And action it is...I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that is quite literally wall to wall action. It does manage to demonstrate a story but its pretty thin because this is just one event happening in this wasteland. When its all over, I couldn't think of anything bad to say about it. It was insane and I loved it.The only less than stellar comment I can say about the film is Mad Max himself. If I were George Miller, I would have ditched Max as the focus of the film and changed it to Furiosa (but more on that in a moment.) Tom Hardy picks up the iconic role of Max and he is alright in the role. The thing I've always found with Hardy is I'm not sure he's a leading man. He's a hot commodity in Hollywood but I don't feel like he has the charisma to truly carry a film and I didn't feel like he carried this one. I get that Max is a man of few words but you go back 30 years and watch Gibson in the role and he just oozes charisma. You are riveted to his Max. Hardy's Max you hardly remember he is there most of the time. You could remove him from the film and it would have been nearly as good. The scene stealer, the heroine, the reason to see this film is Charlize Theron. She is absolutely mind blowing amazing as Furiosa. Her character is full of depth, determination and simple bad-assery. She is one of the best female heroes on screen in a very long time. Nicholas Hoult is excellent as the insane defector Nux. His character could carry a film on his own. Hugh Keays-Byrne returns to the Mad Max Universe as our main villain Immortan Joe. Keays-Byrne played Toecutter in the original film 35 years ago and despite being a little underdeveloped, hes make a heck of a villain this time around too. The gals that play Immortan Joe's wives are also quite good but underdeveloped. Still the film definitely has a lot of extremely strong female characters.George Miller has created a chaotic opera of insanity with Fury Road. There are scenes in this movie that made me go...what in the world?...and yet you cannot deny the absolutely epic absurdity of this world he's created. I could watch this ten times to see what is happening behind the action. The film is ultimately one massive car chase and the action does not stop for a single moment and yet it is the furthest thing from mindless action. I thought it was unfortunate so much CGI was used in the film but then I discovered that Miller insisted on practical effects whenever possible so now I don't know what to think but all I know is that I think he may have created a modern day masterpiece much like he did back in 1979 with the original film. Action, sci-fi, Mad Max fans need to see this immediately. It is likely the best summer blockbuster we will see!! 10/10",10,6,19,2 June 2015
The Breakfast Club," The essential coming of age film for the eighties
","The Breakfast Club is for its generation in many ways what I feel The Graduate was for the late sixties. It captures the generation and in some small iconic way manages to make bold statements with seemingly 'teen film' type dialect. Anytime anyone hears 'The Breakfast Club' they fondly remember it making this an absolute classic and giving it deeper meaning than what it might appear to have. The Breakfast Club didn't treat teens like kids but rather portrayed them frankly, openly, and unabashedly, . It took stereotypes that are still to this day very existent in any high school, mixed them together and let every single one of those stereotypes have their moment and explain their side. It even went so far as to show the stick togetherness of youth and the eighties theme of wanting more from life and confusion and being young in an adult ruled world. The Breakfast Club is timeless.For all it's simplicity the cast nail every one of their roles and become icons to every teen out there. The story and cast seem to focus on John Bender played with eerie certainty by Judd Nelson. Bender is the bad ass in every sense of the word. He's the kid that skips school, breaks all the rules, does dope, drinks, has the hard home life, the bully, the shop class kid and he manages to incorporate all of this into a character you end up rooting for somehow. Even the other kids in the detention with him despise him and yet seem to look to him for leadership and come out with a better understanding of where he's coming from. He is the rebel to say the least. Nelson's portrayal is one of the movie greats hands down. Emilio Estevez is terrific as the jock Andy Clark who also has the reputation for bully against the kids who aren't as athletic or 'cool' as he is. Estevez has a quiet demeanor in most of the film and yet is very effective in showing a different style of parental control that somehow matches Bender's but is very different. Anthony Michael Hall is just brilliant as the brainy Brian Johnson who is the most down to earth out of all of them and seemingly the one with the most academic potential and yet you feel the most sorry for in the life he leads inside the school walls. He might be the most unfortunate out of the group socially and it's wearing thin on his mental state. He too turns in a brilliantly quiet performance. This might have been the performance of teen queen Molly Ringwald's career as the snobby, popular, and self obsessed Claire Standish who wants nothing more than to break the mold she has made for herself. She longs to rebel. Ringwald is just amazing in her role. Ally Sheedy is also good as the quiet, disturbed, rather odd Allison Reynolds. Honestly I didn't get or appreciate her character or performance as much as some of the other ones but nonetheless I'm sure others consider her performance brilliant and that's what The Breakfast Club is all about....appealing to everyone in a different way. Regardless the core cast of teens in detention are terrific and their firecracker intensity and chemistry is unmistakable whether fighting like mad dogs with each other or covering for one of the others' mistakes. Paul Gleason turns in a memorable and classic performance as Richard Vernon, the tired, and worn out teacher who is left to watch the Saturday Detention kids. He's harsh and abrasive and downright fed up with kids in general it would seem. Basically he appears to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown. As basically the only adult in the film and the only character outside of the core kids group he does a good job.The Breakfast Club is so incredibly basic. A cast of basically six people, all set in a library and briefly in other sections of the school and yet it's like an hour and a half adventure. They learn so much about each other, and themselves and rebellion and life outside of school and it's all just from being with each other who happen to be polar opposites of each other. It's just brilliant. I have no doubt that sometime in the future...probably soon...The Breakfast Club will be remade and it simply will never capture the original magic because I'm not sure they even knew what they were doing. There is just a certain honesty to the characters, a certain brilliance to it's simplicity. It's not perfect, I mean ultimately it is a 'teen flick' and many adults who didn't see it as a kid won't ever understand it. The film is chock full of gratuitous foul language, sexual references, drug use (by the kids) and yet this is life...this is what is dealt with then and today and probably in the future...this is more reality than it is fiction. At the same time the film is darkly hilarious, has some incredible one liners, and manages some romance which for me is where the film hits a stand still. The brief romance between Ringwald and Nelson is perfect for the film because as he points out to her, making out with him and getting even with her parents '...in that capacity, would be outstanding.' It's rebellion not romance. But the sudden and forced romance between Andy (the Jock) and Allison (the outcast) is ridiculous and unnecessary but then again it's a very 'eighties' kind of move. All Allison needs is a make over by the popular girl and the popular jock is all over her...it's a dream come true. I think it clashes with the main message of the film. Nonetheless you can't exist until you've seen The Breakfast Club. It's a stone cold classic and a must see. 8.5/10",8,0,1,2 June 2007
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Desperately trying to capture the greatness of the original but falling short
","I'm not like other movie critics or movie watchers...I love a sequel...bad or good if I liked the original I will keep coming back to see the characters I love again and again but there is definitely a certain expectation that I have and the original Transformers film was so brilliant and unique and took live action translations to a new level. Yes Michael Bay blew things up in a huge way but will anyone (especially kids from the eighties) forget the first time we saw Optimus Prime in live action in that first film? The problem was trying to top that first film. Transformer 2 was so confusing and packed with more robots than seemingly possible. Transformers 3: Dark of The Moon tried to fix a lot of those mistakes and did well in some aspects. I think the issue with the third instalment wasn't even the robots but rather the people. The lead cast has just grown stale and Shia LaBeouf boyhood charm is now an overactive ego.LaBeouf went from a talent to watch in Holes to having an enormous ego that shows on screen. I don't think his career will last much longer because people see that ego and are turned off by it. Many people complained about Meghan Fox and her acting ability but compared to the new underwear model they added to the cast, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Fox looks like Meryl Streep. Her ridiculous facial expressions (often mocked to great lengths on Youtube) and her simply awful acting ruins the story. John Turturro, who is a great actor, and is still good in this is also bordering on being annoying and overdone as well which is unfortunate. The only redeeming performances are the most underused by the military team consisting of Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel. Frances McDormand joins the cast as the Secretary of Defense but doesn't really up the ante any, Patrick Dempsey's role is mostly pointless and only helps at bringing out LaBeouf's star ego.Transformers 3 is not a total loss because once again the special effects are outstanding, the battle scenes are breath taking and seeing the Transformers in action is just simply still cool. But you can see the series starting to lose its steam and that really is a shame but I'm sure a reboot is just around the corner and I say go for it!! But it might be time for Michael Bay to step back and let some fresh eyes took over the project. This is a must see for anyone who has already followed the series this far. Special effects, and battle scenes will keep you entertained but the human part of the film might leave a bitter taste in your mouth. 7/10",7,10,16,29 December 2011
Born on the Fourth of July," An absolutely moving and incredible experience...the ultimate word on Vietnam vets
","Oliver Stone is without a doubt one of my favorite directors. Yes he can be pretentious but he has this undeniable talent of bringing the message home and making you feel every minute of it. That being said, believe it or not, I don't think I've ever seen all of Platoon which is usually considered the ultimate 'Nam movie. It's definitely on my list of films to see and soon. However if Platoon is the ultimate 'Nam movie than Born On The Fourth of July could be considered the ultimate follow up to the world the Vietnam vets returned to. The film literally goes from before the battlefield, to the brutality of the battlefield and Vietnam situations to the aftermath facing all vets when they return and in particular one very patriotic and determined man who loses everything in Vietnam. The film is not only brilliantly written and directed thanks in big part to a very close personal and creative relationship with Ron Kovic (who's story this is) but an absolutely mind blowing performance by it's lead star. So many moments in this film will make you feel emotion and anger and patriotism in a way that few films have ever done and probably only Oliver Stone could do with such incredible gusto.If you have ever wondered or doubted where Tom Cruise's Hollywood legend status came from just sit down and watch Born On The Fourth of July. He was absolutely robbed of an Academy Award playing this bold and moving and completely incredible performance as wounded veteran Ron Kovic. His character goes through such huge changes emotionally, physically and just in life. He starts as an eager High School graduate to a leader on the battlefield to this emotionally wrecked veteran to a man who speaks for his beliefs and Tom Cruise nails the role and you can just see the intense work and drive he put into this role. Definitely one of his best!! This film is truly all about Kovic and everyone else is a supporting cast member but it's a strong cast. Raymond J. Barry as his loving but devastated father, does a good job, Caroline Kava is really brilliant as Kovic's religiously fanatic mother, and Frank Whaley gives a moving performance as Kovic's boyhood friend who also returns from 'Nam mentally sick.I believe right now, if I could political for just a moment that Vietnam films are very pertinent right now to our current war situations around the world. That being a very unpopular war but this is a really moving film about a man who believed in what he was doing and slowly became aware of what he was facing when he returns home. The film will bring you to tears it's just an incredible over the top emotional powerhouse of a film and it feels like Stone just lets Cruise do his thing and Cruise has this powerhouse performance that is just mind blowing. The direction on the battlefield is brilliant and disturbing and very gritty and the numerous scenes of protest are brilliantly done by Stone and his crew. I can't recommend this film enough for many reasons but if you want something moving then this will make you realize how powerful films can be. Oliver Stone is an amazing director and this film is a perfect example of what he can do with a cast and with a camera. See this classic war film now!! 10/10",10,1,3,16 July 2008
The Social Network," Worthy of all the praise, brilliant cast, great story, and just a terrific film
","I went into The Social Network with zero expectations. I knew the context and thought in the back of my mind it sounded a little silly but I didn't know the story behind the juggernaut that is Facebook. Whether you want to see The Social Network as truth, or fiction or somewhere in the middle it doesn't deny how incredibly fascinating the film is, brilliantly acted, with great characters. I was actually surprised that the critics jumped on the band wagon for this one because I didn't think this would be their type of film but it turns out that the movie received great awards and notice and all for good reason. The film is a drama that will keep you glued to the story from beginning to end thanks in no small part to the powerful performances. On top of that the film has a terrific haunting soundtrack (Academy Award winning) that will stay with you long after the film has ended. This just seems to be one of those films where everything works...the cast, the score, the director, and the tone of the film. I suppose it doesn't hurt that Facebook is something that 99% of the world is familiar with, but really it doesn't matter.Jesse Eisenberg headlines the cast as the brilliant and perhaps ironically socially awkward Mark Zuckerberg. Eisenberg gives this subtle and incredibly pathos fuelled performance. You dislike him, love him, and pity him all at once and constantly but his success and brilliance is easily portrayed by him. This will certainly sky rocket his career although I'm not sure his acting ability goes far from this performance. Andrew Garfield gives, in my opinion, the best performance in the film as Zuckerberg's best friend and partner Eduardo Saverin. Garfield's performance is incredibly emotional and depthy and he goes through so much in the film and he is the character I rooted for the most. He is certain to be a rising star especially with the new Spiderman on the cusp of his career. Armie Hammer does an amazing job playing a dual role as the twins who sue Zuckerberg for 'stealing' their idea. Certainly he plays the role well enough that each twin has their own distinct personality and you would have to stop and think about it before realizing it is the same guy playing both roles and that speaks worlds to his performance. Up and coming It girl Rooney Mara gets top billing in the film usually with the rest of them but she has a very small role although pivotal to the story as Zuckerberg's ex girlfriend. She has good chemistry with Eisenberg and the opening scene with the two of them sets the stage for the entire film really. I think, similar to Garfield, Justin Timberlake's performance is very under-appreciated in this film. He gives a great performance as Napster founder Sean Parker. He is sleazy and fast talking but a great business man and he carries his parts flawlessly and I hope he gets the recognition he deserves in future roles.With successes and some stumbles Aaron Sorkin is an amazing writer. Despite its quick cancellation his TV Series Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip had some of the most witty and brilliant writing I have ever seen. He also penned cult fave The West Wing, Charlie Wilson's War (also very well written but poorly received) and its good he got some great recognition (Oscar win) for this film because it has the perfect pace, great characters and just a really terrific story. Add into this the amazing David Fincher (Se7ven, The Game, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button are three of my favorites from him...truly amazing films.) David Fincher knows better than anyone how to set a tone and he does it perfectly with this film. This isn't his usual type of film and yet he still brings in his dark, foreboding, broody, emotional tones to it and it works perfectly. Some people love it, and some people hate it but I was blown away by how amazing the film was. Give it a chance because it is entertaining and brilliantly put together and just a truly terrific film all around. I don't usually agree with professional critics but in this case I think they truly nailed this one down when they showered it with awards and nominations. 10/10 Riveting!!",10,1,2,21 March 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Just falls short of greatness...truly uplifting and touching but yet lacks great heart
","This unfortunately for the most part turned out to be the kind of film where the truly moving and important parts were used up in the trailer which definitely gets you rushing out to see it and I must stress that I don't mean to downplay the story or the message because there is something powerful and meaningful to it and Will Smith is brilliant but I just didn't feel the intense heart in the film that I expected. I don't know if it was the direction or the story or what it was but it lacked that little touch that made the film truly brilliant. I felt like the story dragged a lot and it wasn't smooth or well put together for the most part despite it's message, moral and strong lead actor.I have never doubted Will Smith as a serious actor. I have always enjoyed his performances from slapstick comedy, to action, to serious roles like his under rated performance as 'Ali' and The Pursuit of Happiness certainly displays his talents. Smith plays the lead role of determined father, husband and man Chris Gardner. Now Gardner is a man who has chased dreams and never gotten them fulfilled. He lost his life savings in a face down business venture that he STILL believes in and cares about, he is stuck in a relationship with a woman who doesn't believe in him or support him, and yet it doesn't slow him for a minute in chasing another dream that does indeed work for him after a struggle unlike anything before. The true underlying message of the film is that you don't ever give up on your dreams no matter what the cost and his dream almost costs him everything...in fact does for a lot of time. But Gardner never stops fighting, never stops trying despite desperation and homelessness and trying his very best to raise his son. Smith is inspirational and important and single handedly makes this film worth while despite a sub par script. Jaden Smith (Will Smith's real life son) premiers as Gardner's young son who doesn't really ever understand his circumstances but loves his father unconditionally and does see what his father is doing. Both father and son go through so much and give up so much of what they both love to accomplish something bigger. One of the stranger things is I expected an unmistakable and real bond between Father and son and I just didn't feel it. There wasn't reality there and I had hoped for more. However Jaden does a great job in his first role opposite his Dad. Thandie Newton plays a graciously small role as Smith's wife who is working herself to the bone to support them but comes across as whiny and unappreciative and doesn't want to chase anything but survival for them to barely get along. She quickly and rather shamelessly gives up her son for a job in New York. Newton looks awful, worn out, overworked, exactly what the role called for but I still always find Newton hard to swallow in her roles so it's good that the role is small. The rest of the cast is barely visible except in small doses and the entire story revolves around Gardner's determination and survival.That being said I think is one of the films drawbacks. The entire hope and heart of the film rests on Will Smith. Not that he can't pull that off but the film needed more talent, it needed some strong supporting characters and actors and there wasn't any. The biggest supporting actor was a brand new 7 year old who is good but not that good. I can't honestly say I've seen too many Italian films but perhaps Italian director Gabriele Muccino's style is just different and slower paced but I found the story dragged a little and made too much focus on the already obvious point. All this aside the film has some truly moving moments and really does make you look at the life of a homeless person in a completely different light. The film will pull at your heart strings and I think it's an important film, and a great Will Smith movie where he deserves some critical attention but not necessarily awards. It's good but it could have been outstanding. Still well worth seeing right now!! 7/10",7,1,3,18 December 2006
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The series take a different path which still works thanks to the cast mostly
","Many consider The Last Crusade to be the best in the series. And many attribute Sir Sean Connery's performance as the staunch and proper Dr. Henry Jones Sr. as the turning point in the series and really makes it terrific. I have a slightly different take on both of those aspects. The Last Crusade is still a worthy part of the series and definitely is not 'worse' than any of the others. I just don't believe it's any better either. In fact for me it kind of steered away from the core idea of Indiana Jones bring a gritty action adventure. Yes the film has action and adventure but also feels a little Hollywood with some smart comedy, one liners, bigger cast, bigger budget, and less historical viewpoint despite the idea behind the film. A lot of the film is Indiana rescuing his father from the Nazi's which is a completely different take on the series and a classic moment is Hitler himself signing Indy's book in Berlin. While I do think Sean Connery being added to the cast was a great decision I also think his character and therefore him was overused. It was like they were trying really hard to breath new life into the series and I don't think it needed it. It seemed to leave behind the homage to the 40's serials, and the campiness in exchange for big budget spectacles.Harrison Ford returns as Indiana Jones and as always is terrific as the hero to end all heroes. I think in The Last Crusade his portrayal is a little more sarcastic and humorous and doesn't really get as much opportunity to show off that rugged side that we have came to know and love. But the film had a different tone and Ford adapted Indy to fit that and still created the amazing character. Sir Sean Connery joins the cast as Indy's father and really did a terrific job. He was the polar opposite to Ford's Indiana Jones and yet they had this similar quality that made their roles believable. They have terrific chemistry together and Connery just fit into the cast perfectly. Alison Doody is the latest in Jones' love interests and she also kind of doubles as a villain but a sympathetic villain. She's also far more sultry and seductive than previous heroines from the series. River Phoenix also deserves honorable mention as he portrays the Young Indy and gives us a bit of history on the character in the beginning of the film which is one of the great moments in The Last Crusade. Phoenix is brilliant as young Indy and when grabs that cross and reaches for the ladder and flashes a smirk at the camera...it is a pinpoint accurate smirk that Harrison Ford is renowned for. That alone makes Phoenix a great performer in the film.The Last Crusade is a terrific installment in the series. I mean you have some really key moments like the history of Indy in the opening, and meeting Hitler and the entire creation of his father as a character played by Connery, the tank battle towards the cliff...I mean the film is still a classic and important part of the Indiana Jones series but I still didn't feel like it quite felt the same as the previous two Indiana Jones films. Steven Spielberg returned to the helm for this third film and you can still see his style and amazing directing skills but the film was still different and maybe they were aiming for something a little different. If anything Indiana Jones could be described as resilient and adaptive and this shows a different kind of adventure story set against the back drop of World War II and Nazi occupation but still has this medieval ancient story close behind. Regardless you have to see the film...many consider it the best, I consider it my least favorite but that's like saying I prefer Chocolate cake to Apple Pie or brownies...they are all delicious!! 8/10",8,2,3,18 March 2008
Back to the Future," The BIG 400TH REVIEW...Back To The Future is a top ten in my books!!
","Here I am...wow...like it amazes me every time. This is my 400th review on IMDb. Three years or more, 400 films, some good, some REEEALLY bad and I hope everyone enjoys my reviews because I enjoy writing them and I don't plan on stopping. So for each 100 films I have reviews a Superman film being such a huge fan but for 400 I decided on something special...this film easily hits my top ten of all time favorites list so without further adieu...Back To The Future.Did they know they were making something this incredible when they were making it?? I think perhaps they did, that is part of the magic because Director and creator Robert Zemeckis holds nothing back from this flat out eighties classic fantasy adventure. The film is just so incredibly unique taking a cool, completely hip stereo typical eighties teenager and tossing him back into the mid fifties experience and forcing him to save his own existence by making sure his mother and father hook up. The special effects, the utter intense detail that goes into this amazing story line that makes sure everything flows properly, and captures not only 1985 vividly, but 1955 vividly. Zemeckie creates Hill Valley California from scratch and makes it feel like everyone's home town and he makes sure that we see every aspect of it so we can be as stunned and blown away by 1955 Hill Valley just like Marty McFly. This film is just brilliant.Marty McFly, a classic character in the history of film is played by the irrepressible Michael J. Fox in his hey day. Fox (although 24 at the time) was perfect as the 17 year old kid that everybody wanted to be, and everybody wanted to be his friend and for the course of the film you felt like you were right there along with him. This is without a doubt Fox's best role and he has had some good ones but this one takes the cake. He is so smooth and a fast talking, material driven, eighties kid and he's perfect. How can we forget Dr. Emmett Brown?? We can't!! Christopher Lloyd plays the most eccentric and yet brilliant Scientist inventor of the eighties. Doc, as he is known to Marty, is brilliant but almost to the point of insanity. It shows in his personality, his actions and his creations. His I.Q. is obviously off the charts. Despite the age different Doc Brown and Marty have this incredible friendship and Fox and Lloyd's chemistry reflect this strong bond between them. No one could have expected these two would be such a great pairing but they are!! Lea Thompson plays Marty's mother Lorraine Baines McFly. She spends more time playing the bubbly, rebellious teenage Lorraine and she's terrificly believable as both that role and as Marty's mother. Crispin Glover plays whiny, rather weak George McFly, Marty's father. Now I'm not a big fan of Glover and his personal decisions (such as suing the producers of the sequels to this film) had not made me like him any more but he truly created a unique and terrific anti hero in George Mcfly. I will forever associate Back To The Future with the nerdy annoying laugh and his petrified nerdy walk. Thomas F. Wilson is the bully that everyone wanted to see get his in the end Biff Tannen. Wilson is just terrific as a guy that you absolutely despise and yet he still strikes that feeling of dread when he shows up...he's the perfect bully and adversary to Marty AND his father in 1955. They share the same enemy. The cast mesh so well together and the transformations of thirty years between everyone in the cast with the exception of Michael J. Fox is really astounding. I mean sometimes the make up looks a little cheesy but it's really quite amazing to see them. You really feel like you're traveling in time.And isn't that what makes Back To The Future one of the most incredible adventures of all time. You're right there with Marty 100% of the time and you feel like you're going through everything that he is. The story is brilliant and in such a complex film about time travel there is BOUND to be plot holes but Zemeckis does an incredible job and barely making you notice them and wrapping things up so carefully and creating this incredible world around the characters. Back To The Future is not something someone might see, it's something every single person should see because it IS a classic film and always will be. To this day (20 years after the fact) Back To The Future holds up as well now as it did then against ANY big budget special effects film nowadays. It was years ahead of it's time making it the absolute must see. The movie has a kick ass soundtrack featuring a lot of Huey Lewis and The News tracks that became associated with this film (Power of Love--for instance), and it's the absolute quintessential eighties film...the power of wanting material things (Marty's truck, George McFly's book) social status based on appearance...that's the eighties way!! Throw in some what was then 'cool' four letter words (not a lot but enough to make it feel naughty to the youngsters) and you got yourself everything that Back To The Future is. An incredible film that I have probably seen a hundred times and love it equally as much every single time. 10/10 THANKS FOR READING MY REVIEWS...100 MORE TO GO TILL 500!!",10,2,4,4 August 2006
Goodfellas," As good as those fellas are...I just don't get it
","I have nothing against gangster films and I love Deniro, and Liotta and Pesci...in moderation...The Godfather were brilliant films and I finally made my way around to seeing the infamously talked about 'Goodfellas.' I don't get it. I'll take the heat from any fans and I know there are scores of them...Goodfellas was average at best and simply a trashy look at a mobster from childhood to his end in the mob with some decent but over the top performance, brutally gratuitous language and violence. I suppose in some circles that equivalents to a great film but I need far more. I mean even the story has little depth to it and it's more or less an extended episode of The Sopranos without the character depth. I suppose after having the film hyped for years and hearing about the 'classic' I had high expectations but for me it was run of the mill, annoyingly loud and abrasive but with some good direction. Scorsese knows how to make an epic from beginning to end starting the film in the 50's and 60's and taking it all the way to the mid 80's is a challenge and he does it flawlessly. The gritty underworld, the dark lighting, the facial expressions all very good but put to a pointless story and sub par characters unfortunately.I finally know now why Ray Liotta is still around and still gets parts because I always found him a little obnoxious in roles and I never realized he single handedly headlined Goodfellas and is great at it. His character might be the only one in the film given any depth considering he is the narrator and focus of the film. Disgustingly Liotta got no nomination that year which is absurd because if this film deserved anything (which I don't think it did) Liotta's role was it. Robert Deniro commonly gets credit for the film as being the headliner which is also a bit absurd. He might be the big name for the film but his role was small. He didn't make a significant part in the film until a good hour into it and his role was small but he still certainly brought his Deniro class and style to the ensemble. I think they would have done better to focus more on his character and his relationship with Liotta's character. They had good chemistry but just when you wanted to see more...they moved on to something else. Joe Pesci was over the top insane, downright disturbed Tommy Devito. His performance in this film is legendary 'Oh you think I'm a clown?' but to be perfectly honest he was ridiculous. His performance wasn't sincere or believable and he was downright annoying. He was loud and abrasive and his barrage of gratuitous language actually made the film less watchable and I am not against the use of four letter words in film but his was too much. Lorraine Bracco was quite good in her pre-Soprano role as Liotta's wife Karen who sticks with him through pretty much everything and has some powerfully emotional swings throughout the film. Paul Sorvino is good as the head of the mob family, Paulie, but he doesn't make an impact. You don't really believe anyone would respect him. He's quiet and laid back and basically hiding throughout most of the film. At least with Brando's Godfather he was an image, an icon, something you just were in awe of. The cast all work well together but their characters are so thinly written you just don't give a damn about a single one of them except maybe a little for Liotta's Jimmy Conway.I get that I'm in a severe minority speaking this way about this film and that director Martin Scorsese is like a god to some but I just didn't seem the talent in this film. Scorsese showed talent in The Departed and the cast was a million times better than Goodfellas and deserved all of it's acclaim but I personally think Goodfellas is more of a non-thinking man's mob movie where bloody brutal kills and 1000 times hearing the 'F' word would prompt a dull chuckle as though the audience were 10. No I am not trying to insult anyone I was just severely disappointed by this film after having expected a brilliant classic which I will say hands down is not the case. I suppose if you like the crime genre or moreso the gangster drama than you must see Goodfellas anyways but I can promise you there is FAR better out there than this average, poorly written film. 6/10",6,9,17,29 May 2007
The Great Gatsby," Almost the disaster I thought it would be...unnecessary dud
","First of all, let me say that F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby is absolutely one of my favourite novels. Additionally, though it has been years since I've seen it, the Robert Redford film was brilliant and I loved it. From the moment I saw the trailers for this version I was heavily skeptical. Heaven knows that someone like Baz Luhrmann needs to make things flashy and extravagant and put a modern twist on a classic story. He did some brilliant work with Romeo and Juliet nearly 20 years ago. However, I was worried and now seeing it it has been confirmed that his version of Great Gatsby is an excessive, chaotic, bright, jazzy mess that completely misses the entire concept of Fitzgerald's classic. The modern day rap music and remixes weren't awful but also weren't necessary either. The elaborate (and admittedly brilliantly done) set pieces of a bizarre almost apocalyptic New York and surrounding area seemed to just take away from a story that should be entirely character driven. The story does mostly follow Fitzgerald's story and yet at the same time completely misses its mark and the pacing felt off entirely. There is no doubt that The Great Gatsby is not an action flick or anything but parts of it dragged.This is a talented group of people and yet, in my opinion, completely miscast and that includes the legendary Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio was so miscast as Gatsby and he tries so incredibly hard that it comes off as fake. If I had to hear him excruciatingly and awkwardly say 'Ol' sport' one more time I was going to scream. DiCaprio is a brilliant actor as long as he has the right role and this was not even close to right for him. He was too young (or at least baby faced), awkward and didn't fit the bill. Same could be said for Tobey Maguire. I don't know why they chose to cast these baby faced actors for the film but it doesn't work. Maguire carries the film decently but just not good enough. Joel Edgerton is probably the best cast in his role as the abrasive, womanizing Tom Buchanan. He is definitely the most watchable and the most convincing in his role. Carey Mulligan carries herself well and certainly has this subtle sexuality that is perfect for Daisy and yet the character comes across as near boring. The chemistry between her and DiCaprio is okay but not timeless and passionate the way it should be between Daisy and Gatsby. The cast work well together but not as good as I think it should have been.The single issue with this version of The Great Gatsby is that all this flash and jazz has been created without any thought to the true heart of the story. This story is all about greed, pride, obsession, and gluttony and the threads of each one of those is barely existent in this story. I'm actually very surprised that the film is doing as well as it is especially after being delayed for a year before release. One of the most powerful scenes in the original film was Gatsby's death and once again it is handled well, and powerful and its also artistically done. I simply felt that the cast tried far too hard and came across as unconvincing and the film had more modern glitz and glam than was necessary. The pacing was nearly excruciating at times as it stumbled through an otherwise classic story. I had very low expectations going into this and it met those low expectations but barely and did nothing to exceed them. 4/10",4,34,57,8 June 2013
The Proposal," Sandra Bullock returns to basics with a little edge and heck its just fun
","Nearly every review I read on The Proposal had the same statements and I agreed all around. It wasn't going to blow any minds, or win any acting awards but it was exactly what you expected when you walked in. Classic romantic comedy gal Sandra Bullock goes back to her roots and delivers a cute, funny rom-com and the only difference between this and some of her previous successful romantic comedies is that The Proposal has just a little more edge. Perhaps gives a more adult twist to her family friendly comedies with a little more raunchy humor which was necessary to go up against 2009 comedies like The Hangover. The film isn't trying to blow you away with anything but rather giving you two great stars with incredible comedic timing and personality and delivering a fun, cute adventure that you will enjoy and could watch any time. From slapstick one liners to some really terrific physical comedy the cast is incredibly well put together and just a clever slick little movie. Some terrific cameos round out what is easily a cast that works together and shines by playing off each other in the most perfect way.Sandra Bullock has had ups and downs like any other but ultimately she is a star and 2009 was absolutely her year with this smash success and of course the success of The Blind Side. (I'm gracefully side stepping All About Steve---although I haven't had the pleasure yet.) Bullock demonstrates what made her an absolute star in The Proposal. She's versatile, funny, incredibly charismatic and can be a lady and a little raw at the same time. Ryan Reynolds is equally as versatile. He has done drama, action, horror, and of course comedy and he happens to be the perfect combination to Bullock despite their twelve years age difference. He is also one of the most charismatic young stars in Hollywood. They are truly the stars of the film but the supporting cast is a who's who of character actors who are as fun and charismatic as the leads. Mary Steenburgen (an amazing comedienne) and Craig T. Nelson who is always amazing. The amazing Betty White as Grandma Annie is sadly and almost surprisingly underused but her one liners as always are impeccable.I think women directors always have a special flare when it comes to romantic comedies. And I don't mean to say they make it more like a chick-flick but rather have a knack for telling a story with the characters. Looking at the resume of director Anne Fletcher and you'd think she could write just about anything. The woman has worked on everything from amazing comedy classics like 40 Year Old Virgin to choreography on Catwoman. She obviously enjoys a good story as much as anyone seeing this film. Although her directing resume is fairly new this film will prove her chops. So the moral of my review and most others is The Proposal is the absolutely perfect movie to drop down and just relax for two hours and you'll laugh and just really have a good time. It is the ultimate date movie and anyone who finds something to complain about means they expected more than what it offers. 8/10",8,0,1,5 June 2010
Warm Bodies," Freakin' brilliant...why did I miss this one in theatres?
","I watch a lot of movies and I will literally go see just about anything in the theatres. For whatever reason I missed this one and didn't feel too disappointed about it. If there is one genre right now that is being flogged for all its worth, its the zombie genre. However, they still manage to come up with some original or at least very entertaining premises around the zombie genre (Walking Dead, Flight of the Living Dead...no I'm not kidding...) and now this. I heard good word of mouth on it but I still wasn't sure it would be any good in my opinion. Well open mouth and insert foot. Warm Bodies is wickedly fun, darkly humorous, brilliant executed, well acted and original. Its a Romeo and Juliette post-apocalyptic romance that makes Twilight look even worse than it is because this was actually fun and easy to watch and brilliant. Is it an Academy Award winner? Of course not and it doesn't try to be. This heavy handed 9 I am giving this is based on pure entertainment. I pop it in ready to watch but perhaps write or surf the web at the same time and then the laptop goes away and suddenly I am enthralled in the story and laughing and just having a good time. I don't often mention soundtracks but the soundtrack for Warm Bodies was awesome!! Classic 80's and 90's Rock that just fit the mood for the film so well.Nicholas Hoult is 'R', a zombie who feels a little different than the rest of his kind. Throughout the film he falls in love and finds himself changing back into a human being. Hoult is perfect in the role. He has this awkward intensity and the perfect comedic timing for his character. He is charismatic and fun. Teresa Palmer will certainly be one to watch because I think this film will make her a bit of an 'it' girl. She is beautiful, and feisty and the perfect ying to Hoult's yang. She is a strong female lead and they don't use her sexuality to make a point. They have fantastic chemistry together. I was more than surprised to see John Malkovich amongst the cast. He was terrific and intense as Palmer's father who is emotionally damaged from the zombie apocalypse. He gives an outstanding performance. The supporting cast are really terrific. Analeigh Tipton is sarcastic and funny as the best friend. I wish she had more screen time but she was really great. Rob Corddry was also great in a small role as Hoult's best friend who is also a zombie.Warm Bodies is listed on IMDb as Comedy/Horror/Romance and that is exactly what it is. It embodies all three of those things. It has moments of being dark and creepy and the post apocalyptic setting is done extremely well but then there are some truly great laughs in the film and an epic romance that respectfully channels Romeo and Juliette in an extremely off beat sort of way. The 'Boneys' in the film are done so well without a hint of being campy. They are genuinely and downright creepy!! I often say how a director and screenwriter being the same person is usually a recipe for disaster but there are always exceptions and Jonathan Levine is a huge exception because he is crafted something brilliant here. This is really his first big full length screenplay and it is just about near perfection. From the scene with Julie teaching R to drive, to the balcony scene to the epic and brilliantly shot battle scenes at the end...this is the type of movie that was everything Twilight wasn't...but should be just as popular. I still probably wouldn't suggest it to young teenagers and younger but ultimately there wasn't anything overtly adult about the movie. Bad language was minimal if any at all, violence was certainly there but not blood splattering, and there is no sex...simply romance. Seriously...do yourself a favour because this is one of the best date movies I have ever seen. Zombies and romance makes this the ultimate guy/girl movie!! A near perfect score. 9.5/10",9,3,5,31 May 2013
Cinderella Man," Beautiful story of the real Rocky!!
","Cinderella Man is a guaranteed hit at least with critics although I don't know that I heard all that much of it. Regardless it has an amazing combination and a story to back all of that up. Academy darling Russell Crowe, regardless of all the outside personal stuff is hands down a great actor. He has a quiet intensity about him and he brings his style to James Braddock perfectly. Braddock is a deeply loving family man bent on survival and keeping his family together. But on top of that he's a man who boxes, he's a legend and it's all he knows how to do and Crowe performs this role flawlessly. It's a beautiful performance. Ron Howard is one of my favorite directors. Not only does he manage to make critically acclaimed films but he makes it films that the audience loves. Cinderella Man is no different. He's created a story that is gritty and visual, gray and depressing but pulls a heart warming powerful underdog story out of it that will make you jump up and root for James Braddock.The setting for Cinderella Man is depression era New York and the way that this film is set up will make you feel the depression into your very bones. Sometimes the sets almost look like a stage with a single spot light onto it and instead of cheapening the look, it makes it feel desolate, poor, discouraging and you feel the emotions of all the actors. Renée Zellweger is okay. She kind of sticks out from the rest of the cast because she doesn't really ever reach the caliber of performance that the others do especially the one she shares the most screen time with...Crowe. Paul Giamatti continues his streak of great roles as Braddock's best friend, corner man and supporter Joe Gould. Although the character is a small role he puts real heart into it and is bound for a best supporting actor nomination for sure. The rest of the supporting cast will be familiar faces, great character actors and they all fit the bill. One of my favorite faces who shows up here and there and always turns out a great performance no matter how brief is Bruce McGill who, in Cinderella Man, plays fight promoter Jimmy Johnston. Despite all the impressive very real performances they only help what is a brilliant moving story. Boxing stories on film always seem to hit a note with emotions ie: Rocky, Million Dollar Baby and this film really felt like the common Rocky formula but was far more real than the Italian Stallion. The story was so uplifting and you get so drawn in and the action is great too considering the intense boxing fights especially the final bout against the heavy weight champion. But you never consider it a violent story about boxing but rather one man's return and rise above poverty to save his family and regain his dignity. I don't think there isn't anyone that won't enjoy this captivating film about a boxer who was the hope for thousands. Check this one out for sure!! 9/10",9,2,4,10 December 2005
Jurassic Park," The quintessential Dinosaur movie will likely never be topped
","It's true that few people can create a visual story and spectacle like Stephen Spielberg. I can almost remember seeing Jurassic Park as a kid in the movie theatre for the first time and if you asked me then if I liked it I probably would have told you that it was the greatest movie I had ever seen and meant it. Years later, seeing it again, it has perhaps some of that youthful exuberance I once felt for it but that doesn't make it any less powerful and brilliant and wonderfully created. I think just seeing the film outside of a movie theatre takes away some of the magic because the dinosaurs just aren't as enormous and terrifying and jaw dropping as they are on a 200 foot movie screen. Still I did pick Jurassic Park to be the first movie I watched on my beloved new 42 Inch Plasma which helped a great deal. The characters are intricately created and you become enthralled in their adventure. Spielberg has always had a way of making characters come to life and you become completely attached to them which makes the story even better. On top of that Jurassic Park coins the thrill a minute phrase giving you a non stop jaw dropping riveting story about action and danger and of course dinosaurs of all kinds. The film is just quite simply a modern day classic. One of my favourite scenes in movie history is the scene with the Tyrannasaurus Rex attacking the jeep for the first time with Tim trapped inside. That scene has stayed with me for years along with the Raptors in the kitchen later on in the film. The movie is not soft enough for really little kids but it's not too edgy for the pre-teen/teen crowd but definitely edgy and intelligent enough for any adult or movie lover to watch again and again.Jurassic Park started me on a brief love affair with Sam Neill. His dry and often snarly performance as Dino genius Dr. Allan Grant was perfect. I think his performances in other films as well as this one could be interpreted as an acquired taste but there is something just perfect about the way he interacts with the cast and the script for the movie. Laura Dern is also good as Ellie Sattler. Although she wasn't my favourite character she added a tone of emotion and a strong female lead and had good chemistry with Neill. Jeff Goldblum was just terrific, possibly one of his best roles as he too tends to be an acquired taste, as Dr. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician who warns right from the beginning of playing God. Goldblum is level headed and definitely delivers some of the best lines in the film as the comic relief in a serious deadpan kind of way. Legendary actor Richard Attenborough returned to acting after fifteen years away to portray Billionaire John Hammond, the creator and mastermind of Jurassic Park. He is terrific in many ways and just really captures the character and his conflict with what he's created. Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards play Tim and Lexi Murphy, Hammond's grandkids. Both are terrific and really capture the teen audience very well and have some really hair raising scenes. Neither of them unfortunately went on to much else but they were terrific in this film. One of the most under used characters that I really thought could have also been a leading role was Bob Peck who played Robert Muldoon. He had a mysterious hero quality about him and I really wanted to see more of him as he ended up facing his greatest fears in the raptors when they escape. He was terrific in the small role he was given. The top notch supporting cast is also amazing including the legendary Samuel L. Jackson, Wayne Knight, B.D. Wong, and Martin Ferrero as the 'blood sucking lawyer' as Hammond refers to him.This is just one of those films, especially by Spielberg that was destined to be a classic and it is one you can watch over and over again which I have done frequently. The movie has an amazing story, riveting action and everything that makes an epic film amazing. Perhaps they dropped the ball by serializing the films (although the second book by Creighton was amazing) and I will get to reviewing the sequels too but no matter how you look at it, the first Jurassic Park is a movie that every single person must see period. 10 out of 10***Update*** Had the amazing opportunity to see Jurassic Park in its (unfortunately 3D) Re-release. While the 3D changed nothing and wasn't even that impressive, seeing the movie on the big screen was amazing...again. I even got a little bit emotional seeing a few of the scenes again that shaped my movie going as a youngster. This movie is still a modern day epic classic.",10,3,4,20 August 2008
Valkyrie," A captivating and interesting spin on the World War II story and Hitler himself
","Leave it up to the recently controversial Tom Cruise to find a film that people can bicker and argue and get all bunched up about. As usual most of the complaints about the film are ludicrous. 'Supporting Nazis.' 'Painting Nazis in a good light.' 'Actors make ridiculous Nazis.' Valkyrie is the furthest thing from all these things. Instead it is actually a very mainstream film, part drama, part action by a very mainstream director telling a story from a very different perspective. World War II films are a dime a dozen but there are few if any films from the Nazi perspective about an internal plot to kill Hitler which history shows us happened a lot. That means that there were some Nazis, Germans, soldiers, whatever you want to call them that did want to kill Hitler. The film packs in intensity and action and special effects and some decent, solid performances to make a very entertaining film. The reason you're not seeing it sweep any award shows is that Valkyrie tries less to be true to history or emotionally binding then it does to be mainstream entertainment which means when watching it the viewer should be taking it with a grain of salt, not looking for historical inconsistencies or how bad someone's German accent is or isn't.Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise plays the lead role of a disenchanted German soldier. I don't care about Cruise's personal life, I have always thought he was a great actor, with great Hollywood charm. Cruise lights up the screen and looks great with his ominous eye patch and dark coats and Nazi hats. He commands presence on screen. Bill Nighy was okay if his character was meant to be quiet and withdrawn and kind of weak willed. He does alright but certainly his character and his performance doesn't command much of anything. Tom Wilkinson does a great job as the loud and bulbous Friedrich Fromm. He doesn't have a big role but he does well in the part. David Bamber is terrific and does a great job as the evil man himself Herr Adolf Hitler. Hitler is a mysterious character and somehow they make him look like a celebrity of sorts among his men and his presence and everything about him shows his charisma and his nature and Bamber is brilliant in the role. He really does bring something to the subtle but powerful role.Director Bryan Singer is the exact definition of a mainstream director having headed up action films for a lot of years. So what could he bring to Valkyrie? Well I think the film is more friendly to the average film goer who is going to be entertained about a piece of war history even if it's not the most accurate docu-drama out there. Singer wants to tell a story, but still blow things up and show off some Hollywood stars and despite some of the content surrounding Valkyrie if you go into the film as a piece of entertainment then you will be entertained and if you have insatiable curiosity like me you will look into the more truthful stories behind the assassination attempts on Hitler. Doesn't matter what you think about the content Valkyrie is an entertaining movie that one can enjoy for it's face value and Cruise is great in it. 8/10",8,3,5,26 January 2009
The Simpsons Movie," Absolutely fantastic!! This is why this is STILL one of the greatest sitcoms and animated shows in history and now big screen!!
","I don't really know what I expected from The Simpson's Movie. Certainly I hoped that everyone who has worked on this incredible show would pull out all the stops and put everything they were into bringing this historical and important family to the big screen. I grew up with the Simpsons when it was just cool to be bad like Bart Simpson and now I can watch the show and laugh at all the subtle hidden politically incorrect jabs and famous little parodies that were way over my head as a kid. Could they possibly make this all seem fresh and hilariously funny and give it everything that this film deserved with well over 17 years in the making? Never, ever, underestimate The Simpson family. Many reviewers and critics have stated that the film is nothing more than an extended episode but a really good episode at that and in some ways they are right but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did push the boundaries and add something different then if I were sitting at home watching them. There was something frightfully polished and perfected about the film. It seemed like it was on such a grandiose scale and that they had been putting away all this A+++ material for just this occasion because after the first half of the film my sides hurt from laughing so hard whether it was the typical Simpson's one liners, the very subtle stab at society or the downright hilarious sight gags and outright funny little puns and jokes...this captured every second of it. And they did a little pushing the envelope...certainly nothing like South Park did but then South Park isn't even the little baby sidekick to The Simpsons. The three major envelope pushing moments (in my opinion) were all so well placed and were all hilarious and I'll cover them in just a moment.I'm not even going to talk about the cast because they are all...each and every one of them legendary. This cast has been together probably longer than any other cast in TV history and they ARE their characters and no one else could touch them. I really hope that they get every penny they deserve for their years of tireless effort and now to throw out this truly terrific film to justify everything they have done. Trying to rate this cast would be like judging a person on their own voice...it's just perfect in every way.So moving onto those envelope pushing moments....yes The Simpson's movie contains nudity...and child nudity at that. During a hilarious scene where Homer dares Bart to skateboard naked through downtown we are treated to hilarious attempts at covering his 'doodle' as he refers to it and then suddenly, almost too quickly too notice...there it is...plainly drawn on Bart's little body. And then before you can recover from the shock...Ned Flanders is saying 'Penis' in front of Rod and Todd. Shoot to second moments with Homer jumping down a sink hole to escape the angry mob wanting to kill him. In he jumps and down he sinks as he flips the bird on both of his hands and then stops sinking plugging the sink hole. He then quickly uses his middle fingers to start digging himself deeper into the whole. And finally pure and innocent Marge. The bomb is ticking away and Homer and Bart have seconds to throw it through the tiny hole in the dome. Marge yells 'Oh would you hurry up and throw the God D$%N Bomb' in that lovable motherly voice and it's like hearing your own saintly mother swear and it's just downright funny. Add into that the dumbest you have ever seen Homer Simpson...the stupidest mistakes he could possibly do and nothing in the movie is stereotypical, run of the mill or ordinary.Creator and head of The Simpsons Matt Groening didn't fly out looking for some off the wall director to helm this up...instead he looks right at home because that's what this was truly about I think. Keeping it real, and keeping it SIMPSONS. Director David Silverman who has been directing The Simpsons, various episodes, as well as years of animation throughout TV-Land takes the project and does just a terrific job. The laughs are literally non stop. Could this possibly be The Simpsons swan song? I mean once you've climaxed after 17 years with this level of brilliance I'm not sure you could ever recreate the magic but then as I said...never underestimate The Simpsons or anyone on their team.There are a few remarkable things about the film. First of all, yes everyone is present. I can't really think of anyone that wasn't there but it was for a very brief period of time. The Simpsons film is truly about The Simpsons, especially Homer. The town of Springfield has always been as important to the story as The Simpsons but this film simply uses everyone as a stepping stone to their story and it works but I kind of missed everyone and seeing more of them. Secondly there is truly the most unique scene in Simpsons history as Marge finally reaches her limit with Homer and what he's done. You will never hear a more serious or important tone from Marge, it literally sounds different than anything we've ever heard from Julie Kavner as Marge and it really is quite touching. Hands down one of the summer greats in an incredible summer of movies. Fans of Simpsons hail because this not only does it justice but knocks it out of the park. 9/10",9,2,7,11 August 2007
Alien: Covenant," Definitely the definition of a 'reboot'
","What I mean by that is Ridley Scott took his science fiction classic and create this prequel trilogy (this is the middle instalment according to him) and created a different vibe, feel, almost a different direction entirely. Prometheus and now Alien Covenant have an artistic almost interpretive dance feel to them. I love Prometheus but there were plenty of complaints about it basically that it lacked the Alien connection. Covenant fixes that. It gives you more to the same storyline but brings back the Aliens in a big way. Maybe we won't understand the full picture until the third film but so far I'm intrigued enough to stay with it. Covenant is unique in that it gives us that familiar vibe that the original Alien and Aliens and Alien3 brought to the table but still keeps that fantasy, history aspect that Prometheus built. That does make the first half of the film a little dry, slow moving and it doesn't build the suspense all that well. However, once Ridley Scott mixes in the horror and darkness that made the original Alien a classic things start to come together. There are some truly first rate horror scenes and they utilize some of the more classic visuals (the Alien in the chest) and recreate them to great success. I love the concept that to make it fresh and new rather than coming out the front...the Alien comes out the back. Simple but effective.I read one review that really trashed the cast of the film calling them monotone and boring and stereotypical. I didn't get that at all. Are they as memorable as some of the original cast, no. I do think they tried too hard on Danny McBride's character as 'Tennessee' but he does get a good story arc and McBride is actually very good in the role and has some tense and emotional scenes. Michael Fassbender returns to his role as David and also Walter, the Androids. I recall Fassbender being one of the best parts of Prometheus and he was good in this but I felt something was off with the character development and something was missing. Still he did well. Katherine Waterston was fantastic as the heroine of the film. Whether or not on purpose she has the look and feel of an Ellen Ripley type character though a little softer around the edges. I would love to see her take over in future instalments of this franchise. Billy Crudup and Demián Bichir round out what I consider to be the main and supporting cast with a few other third string characters as well all played well enough but without a lot or any back story. The film might actually have too many characters who are ultimately not much more than fodder for the Alien(s). Ridley Scott is a sci-fi legend in the directors chair of course. It is obvious he is very passionate about this franchise and he has or has had ideas in his mind for a very long time about the lore behind the Alien franchise and how it ties into human beings. He might be taking it in a very intellectual direction and I think we are all okay with that but he'll want to be careful to remember what we love about this franchise as well which was the horror and survival nature and isolation. While not the best of the series it holds its own and hopefully represents a good bridge between Prometheus and the end of the new trilogy that links all the series together. 8/10",8,25,47,31 May 2017
Draft Day," Draft Day is very nearly stunning!
","Here are a few facts to ponder going into this review. First of all, I'm a HUGE Kevin Costner fan and am thoroughly enjoying his resurgence in theatres already in 2014. Simply because of my love for him I was eagerly anticipating this. Some were comparing it to Moneyball and that made me nervous because frankly I thought Moneyball was a stone cold dud. I am NOT a huge sports fan. I go to the occasional game for fun (Baseball and Hockey preferably) and outside of playing a little football in High School, I am not a football fan by any stretch of the imagination. One IMDb reviewer opened their review by saying that anyone who wasn't interested in football or the draft would find this boring...I couldn't disagree more. Reitman (a brilliant director in my books) has created a film that simply anyone can enjoy. You will find yourself enthralled by these characters and you will feel the amazing tension, the stress, the minute by minute thrill of being amongst these people making vital decisions to their team. It isn't about whether this time is successful (we don't even find that out) its simply about the Draft as the title implies and I was riveted to put it mildly. The script is brilliant, the dialogue is very smart and keeps you watching for each moment as it changes. Regardless of your football knowledge or expertise or lack thereof, you will follow this and just have a great time doing it.Kevin Costner is charismatic period. He certainly loves his sports film and name one he's done that wasn't good or is considered a 'classic' now. Bull Durham, Field of Dreams, Tin Cup, For The Love of The Game...they're all at least very watchable. Draft Day is deserving to sit amongst them but it is a very different sort of 'sports movie.' Costner's Sonny Weaver is a fascinating character. You will literally see and feel his stress and tension and what he's going through and then you watch the pay off as he casually yells 'I LOVE THIS JOB.' Costner was bang on. I find it hard to really sink myself into Jennifer Garner as an actress. She's cute and fun but when I see her in films like this that require a certain amount of intensity, seriousness and drama. She comes across almost bored and just doesn't seem to manage the role as deep as she should. She is okay in Draft Day, her chemistry with Costner is decent (and believable given their age difference) and I suppose her subtle performance leaves room for Costner to really shine. Another reason Draft Day is so good is the amazing whose who of character actors in supporting roles. Chadwick Boseman, Patrick St. Esprit, Terry Crews, Frank Langella, Denis Leary, Timothy Simons, Sean Combs and Tom Welling each deserve mention for their respective roles. I handpicked those supporting performances because small or big they each had a moment that was perfect. For most of them it was scenes exchanging dialogue with Costner and it was simply well done to say the least. Welling (whom I am also a big fan of from Smallville days) has literally one significant scene and it was enough for me to go...wow. Josh Pence was a little underwhelming in his role as coveted quarterback Bo. I think the role could have been great but he doesn't put much into it and is quite generic. I also don't quite understand the role played by Griffin Newman who might be some sort of comedic relief but is really expendable and goes nowhere.Legendary director and producer Ivan Reitman very nearly always tells an incredibly entertaining story. He brings the most out of these characters and makes them so vivid and most importantly has a way of making you feel like you are right there...no matter how ridiculous the concept. Draft Day is obviously very realistic but he deserves such great kudos for crafting a story that I believe anyone can sink themselves into. He didn't disappoint me one bit and my expectations were decently high. Move over Moneyball (I don't care how much critics liked it and the ridiculous Oscar nominations it got) this was superior in every single way. Football fans will enjoy the myriad of NFL'ers playing themselves and the film is laid out in such a way to subtly explain everything to those of us not familiar with the sport. Draft Day is a must see and I guarantee will hold its own in the hall of fame for sports films. An absolute pleasure! 9/10",9,11,16,18 April 2014
The Wizard of Oz," Yet another timeless classic
","I hate reviewing movies like this. This is an unequivocal classic. Even when some lists and reviewers have called the film one of the most over-rated classics...you can sort of understand why. I grew up on this movie, watching it again and again. But I would hazard to guess that 99% of North America know the absolutely timeless songs, and the constant barrage of famous quotes. Even watching it again, when I got to see it on the big screen which was awesome, I was shocked by how many literally epically famous quotes are from this one movie. Considering when the film was made this had to be a stunning feat for film making. The special effects lack in some aspects and then in other ways it is truly astonishing. The painting backdrop of OZ definitely looks dated, seeing it again, but then you look at something as small as the Scarecrow/Lion/Tin-man's make up and it is really quite astounding. The film is simply fun and a little bit dark at times creating one of the most well known villains in film history. It has a moral story to it that I actually felt was a little forced but you can't deny that the film is just beautiful and simple and fun and takes many of us back to a time of our childhood.Judy Garland was many things in her life, and I don't think I've seen her in anything other than this but she was simply angelic as Dorothy. Squeaky clean and beautiful and perfect and flawless in her role. Her voice is beautiful of course and this role easily one of the most iconic. Ray Bolger gives one of my favourite performances in films as the Scarecrow. He is terrific and bumbling and just his facial expressions and movements are brilliant. In my opinion, this would be an Oscar worthy performance. Bert Lahr is probably equally as iconic as the cowardly Lion. He certainly plays up the role and is very campy but somehow it works for the film. Sometimes I think his character was slightly overused but you can't deny he is an integral part of the cast. I always felt like Jack Haley as the Tin Man was very under-rated and under-appreciated. Its true that he doesn't stand out quite as much as everyone else but I still think his more subtle and courageous character was fun and well played. What can you say about Margaret Hamilton? Her Wicked Witch is certainly one of the most well known villains in history and for good reason. She is mean and her cackle is perfection. Nowadays you might say her witch is so stereotypical and maybe it was then too but she nails this role. She is certainly one of my favourites from childhood. I have to say that Billie Burke as Glinda has always been one of my least favourite parts of The Wizard of Oz. I would hazard to say she is downright annoying and her awful condescending tone (brilliantly and respectfully mocked by Michelle Williams in the new Oz film) was terrible. Honourable mention to both Charley Grapewin and Clara Blandick as Uncle Henry and Auntie Em who are both excellent in their roles. And finally the Wizard himself Frank Morgan who is a master of disguise playing five different roles. Morgan is very good in each of his roles and certainly captures everything that we have come to know about the Wizard of Oz.Its quite amazing reading about all the trials and tribulations this film went through to get made including multiple directors and actors in various roles. 1939 was some kind of year for director Victor Fleming who I think is a visionary and that's only from seeing Wizard of Oz and Gone With The Wind. He knows his material and he knows how to completely whisk away his audience to a completely different world and that's perfect for Oz. I could nit pick the film and find a handful of things that annoy me now...as an adult, and maybe as someone who has watched so many movies that I have become a little bit jaded but you know I'm going to go in a different direction with this review. Who am I to deny a sincere classic. This film has stood up for 70 years and given us some of the most well known music, characters, film lines and the movie is easily one of the most watchable. I could watch this any day and any time and just simply enjoy it and that to me makes this a huge 10!! 10/10",10,3,4,17 April 2013
The Soloist," A solid drama with two powerful actors
","When this film originally showed trailers I was dying to see it. I didn't get to see it for a very long time and just kept putting it off but it was always a film I really wanted to see. Finally I picked it up on blu ray and sat down to watch it. For all that build up and expectation the film did not let me down. I think a big part of its success should be attributed to the two stars who are both Hollywood stars and very talented actors. Still the based on a true story aspect certainly doesn't hurt as it is a moving and powerful story. The film uses music as its core character as Nathaniel is passionate about nothing more than his music. Whether or not, as some reviewers discuss, the film is an accurate portrayal of schizophrenia it certainly sheds some serious light on the illness. Incredibly though it doesn't drag the film down. One of the best parts of The Soloist is the fact that it isn't dark or heavy handed but instead has this light hearted feeling that leaves you feeling good. I mean the content means there will be a little darkness to it but considering this is a feel good film at its core.Robert Downey Jr. has quickly been one of the biggest stars in the world and he has talent to back that. His performance as kinda self involved Steve Lopez. I say kinda but he really is a good guy right from the beginning. The best part of the character is that he's just a regular guy. He isn't over the top one way or another and he becomes attached to Nathanial. Nathanial is played by Jamie Foxx, another Hollywood star with talent to back. The chemistry between Foxx and Downey Jr. is amazing. Foxx plays Nathanial with such heart and passion and you will become as attached to him as Lopez does. The passion he displays pays a great homage to the real person I am sure. Catherine Keener is Lopez' ex-wife and colleague. She is decent and her and Downey have good chemistry, even great at times but her character is a little low key compared to Foxx and Downey and she sort of gets buried in the overall scheme of things. The supporting cast including Tom Hollander, Lisa Gay Hamilton and Nelsan Ellis are all very good.Director Joe Wright doesn't have a lot of credits to his name but he does have some powerful and well made films to his credit including Atonement and Pride and Prejudice but I think The Soloist is really his first main stream film and he does wonderful at it. I'm sure directing was easy enough considering the great leading cast. The story is well written and well adapted from Lopez's actual book about the situation. So to sum all of this up The Soloist is a feel good film that might seem like it has some really dark content but it is handled by all involved so well that it actually turns in a light and fun story with real emotion behind it. Definitely recommend this for a Saturday night movie night. It might not have been a critical hit like it could have been but it will entertain and move you. 8/10",8,0,0,6 February 2011
Dodgeball," Oh so very popular!
","I admit...Ben Stiller's popularity is a head scratcher to me. Even comedians I can't stand like Parker and Stone of South Park fame I can still see something appealing in their style. Ben Stiller to me seems kinda silly yet I admit I have enjoyed a fair number of his films. Still it's usually the rest of the cast that makes the film good. To me he's just okay and yet his films seem to reach this cult status in days where everyone is talking about them. Such is the case with Dodgeball. I've been hearing about this movie everywhere I went and how funny it was and I had to see it so I finally did and I was not disappointed.Dodgeball is the story of two men. Peter Lafleur played by Vince Vaughn and White Goodman played by Ben Stiller. Stiller's character owns a popular, and well to do gym where people are insulted into building better bodies. Vaughn's character owns a small neighborhood gym where good friends hang out, have a good time and people can come without being judged or laughed at. Unfortunately Lafleur is too nice of a guy to make a profit off all his clients so he's in trouble financially and the bank is going to foreclose on his gym leaving it available for hostile takeover by Goodman unless he can come up with fifty thousand dollars in a month to save his gym from the evil Goodman. How is he going to do that? Dodgeball of course. Him and his gym full of out of shape rejects are going to win a national Dodgeball competition in which the top prize is...fifty thousand dollars. Surprised??No it's not a new concept but the Dodgeball angle is different and very funny.Vince Vaughn is one of my least favorite actors because in essence he doesn't seem like an actor at all. He's just always kinda there. He's never impressed me in his variety of roles where he seems to ride the other people's coat tails in the film. He is adequate in the lead here playing a straight faced boring character. Ben Stiller is the exact polar opposite. He's off the wall, over the top, too much to handle and not all that funny. Both of them behave as though this is an extended Saturday Night Live Skit with special guest star Vince Vaughn who is just completely amused by Stiller and his own performance. The absolute saviours of this film are the underdogs and the cameos. Truly they make this film a shining star and a funny, watchable movie. Christine Taylor as the lead actress in the film adds a necessary boost of girl power to the film. She's funny in her own way with her one liners. Stephen Roote is downright hilarious as Gordon the King of The Hill Billesque type character we know and love. Alan Tudyk as a basket case that thinks he's a pirate, and the silently hilarious Jamal Duff as Stiller's right hand man. Rip Torn who plays the Underdogs coach, former pro dodgeballer Patches O'Houllian has some hilarious lines and is just funny to watch, probably one of the best roles in the film. Cameo's by Chuck Norris, William Shatner who is funny without trying to be, and watch for Jason Bateman's hilarious little role as the more than slightly high dodgeball announcer. If the whole football in the groin premise makes you laugh aloud, you won't be able to get enough of Dodgeball because the funniest parts are watching people get nailed with those balls and of course the numerous references to 'balls' in general. Although there is the occasional sexual reference, overall the film doesn't resort to the gross out comedy we have come to expect nowadays from comedies. It's by far not the best comedy I have ever seen but it's worth checking out for a mindless laugh. 6/10",Null,0,1,4 December 2004
The Martian," Definitely lives up to the hype and provides something unique
","The Martian is brilliant in the way its presented. Compared to something like Gravity it buries it because it blends a real feeling science fiction adventure with tons of scientific exploration but includes fun, crazy stunts and special effects and a script that is actually very mainstream with humour and plain dialogue which some fans apparently find off-putting. Some reviews said everything was great but the dialogue was silly and it is in a way but I liked that it was plain speak among this insane survival story that is ridiculous and plausible all at once. The performances and the direction of the film make you feel this could have happened.The cast is very good and the starring role of the film is so well done that it carries the movie. I will say honestly that Matt Damon should have been Oscar nominated for his role just because he makes it believable and fun and scary and takes you on this adventure. Yes he gives the role a lot of different tones but I thought it worked perfectly. The supporting cast are really a lot of A-Listers playing his team that want to rescue him and those working to save him for different reasons including Jeff Daniels, Kristen Whig (who actually does a great job in a small but serious role), Jessica Chastain (one of my least favourite actresses but she was very tolerable in this), Michael Pena, Sean Bean, Kata Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Donald Glover (really liked his small but important role), Benedict Wong, and Aksel Hennie are the roles I thought were best performed in small doses. They kept the supporting characters unassuming but with enough charisma that they made a difference so they didn't feel underused but also didn't get in the way either.The Martian is also so good due to the extreme talent of legendary Science Fiction directly Ridley Scott who really seems to work on pure passion. When he loves something he just completely immerses himself in it and brings it to life. You will feel like you are on Mars surviving with this guy and you will become so attached to him. Considering how long the movie covers the pacing is practically perfect and despite essentially being science fiction the special effects are fantastic and don't feel CGI heavy which is an accomplishment. The Martian is easily one of the best movies of 2015 and is unique considering it could have felt like rehashed material from films like Interstellar and Gravity but those both underwhelmed me whereas The Martian met and exceed my expectations so check it out and 'science the sh%t out of this planet!!' 9/10",9,2,4,23 March 2016
The Fighter," Critically acclaimed, worn out story with good performances
","I have nothing against Boxing films. In fact I adore boxing films. The Fighter was heralded nearly immediately for everything from the performances to the story to the film making and I do understand why and then at the same time I felt like aspects of it were way over-rated. This is not a new story by any means. This story has been done, some better and some worse and it really doesn't add anything to be unique. It takes gratuitous bad language to a whole new level which also doesn't bother me unless it gets way over-used and it does. It is still the Rocky story of the underdog fighting his way to the top and winning against odds only add in the drug abuser brother, the overbearing mother and the fact that this was 'based on a true story.' I'm not saying its a bad film, but I am saying that the two lead roles (more one than the other) save this film from being drivel and make it worth seeing just for those performances.Mark Wahlberg is a solid star in Hollywood now and I have seen him in some great films and I have seen him in so-so films. Sometimes he chooses right. This role is right for him. I don't think it required a ton of acting as he plays the athletic up and comer Micky Ward. Wahlberg gives an emotional and realistic portrayal and would be the best performance if not for that of his co-star. Just when I think I dislike Christian Bale and that he is becoming the ego maniacal, over-rated actor of people like Sean Penn he turns in a brilliant performance. Ironically it always seems to be when he loses a ton of weight and looks lethargic (The Mechanic is a must see indie-gem of his.) In this film he plays washed up boxer and heavy drug abuser Dick Eklund. He is breath taking in his role and if they were going to give Oscars for this film anyway his winning one is testament to how great he was. He steals this movie and turns a 4/10 into a 7/10 just on his own. On the flip side Melissa Leo in her constantly heralded role as Wahlberg and Bale's mother Alice should go down as one of the most over-rated performances in history. I didn't think she was impressive at all and I didn't think she even showed up in the film that much. Amy Adams gives a great performance (far better than Leo's Oscar winning role) as Wahlberg's love interest. She shows a flare for emotional dramatic performance in her character. Character actor Jack McGee is also solid in his role as well considering how small it is. He is always terrific.This film is why myself, and other movie goers like me are becoming so disenchanted with Oscars and Awards like that. This film is okay, its good even and as I said there are some truly outstanding performances BUT the film itself is not that great. Reviewers and critics constantly complain about films being stereotypical, predictable and re-hashing old genre elements and The Fighter does that. But because its based on reality, features heavy hitters (no pun intended) whom Hollywood loves, and directed by David Russell who likes to play to indie critics they all showered it with praise. Watch it and enjoy it especially if you like boxing films and watch Bale's amazing performance and be ready to here and see more white trash than an episode of Trailer Park Boys and you'll probably enjoy it but its not the best film to ever come out of La-La Land by any means. 7/10",Null,1,1,16 August 2011
Law Abiding Citizen," A solid action flick, definitely worth checking out
","It seems as though a good old run of the mill action flick is hard to come by. Sometimes you just want to see a Michael Bay things blowing up, mindless action flick (critics just cringed) but its true! Some things are a given with most action flicks. Usually the characters don't get a lot of depth and there isn't a lot of dramatic breathing room but a good action flick will keep your adrenaline pumping and that is exactly what Law Abiding Citizen does. Star power is easy for the film so they carry the story while action is abundant. In my opinion they stuck to the tried and true recipe of action which is just fine but also doesn't set their movie apart from other like it. The story is very simple (in this case all about revenge in an over the top Death Wish type plot), the characters have basic personalities that are mostly one dimensional, but works due to the star power brought on board, and plenty of things blow up. I am happy to say that didn't work hard at PG'ing the movie because you know what? Sometimes an adult wants to see a solid 'R' rated action flick although I think Law Abiding Citizen was 14A or something.Gerard Butler seems to be blazing his way to the top as a Hollywood hero and heart throb. In the last year this guy did comedy, romantic comedy, action, and drama. He is versatile and easy to watch and commands screen presence. In his case I would have really liked to have seen a little more depth to his character. This is a devastated father who also happens to be a top notch Government trained killer (similar to Liam Neeson's Taken character who had more depth.) Jamie Foxx is terrific as the struggling Assistant DA who truly only does what he think is best but in the process puts a target on him and everyone around him when he lets one of Butlers' family's killer off of death row. Foxx and Butler are terrific opposite of each other and really do the cat and mouse game well. Essentially aside of a small supporting cast the movie is entirely about Foxx and Butler.One of the films shortcomings ironically is its best parts. Foxx and Butler do this great mind game cat and mouse type deal and yet I could imagine with a bit of a more intelligent script their interaction and chemistry could have been off the charts. Director F. Gary Gray comes from music as many manic action directors do but fortunately for him his style is not manic because it would not have worked for this movie. Instead he goes for a subtle approach. He doesn't really have a ton of experience so if I'm right he goes in slowly which is a good move for him because he could have taken two great actors and really messed this up for them. At least this way it was reasonably successful and enjoyable. It's the perfect Saturday night flick for the grown ups, plenty to enjoy for both the man and the woman and while it won't likely be many's favorite movie, it will keep you excited and fulfilled for the two hours you watch it. 8/10",8,0,1,2 February 2010
V for Vendetta," An amazing and controversial piece of film!!
","First off I want to say that I am really honestly shocked that this film got made. Parts of this film and story were some of the most controversial and perhaps politically charged scenes I have ever seen especially in an entirely fictional sci-fi action film. There a very powerful and debatable message to V For Vendetta that leaves you thinking about the morals and story long after it ends. Finally the supposedly multi-talented Wachowski brothers can add something of real sustenance to their resume. The Matrix (the original film) was brilliant and well made and spawned an amazing story and world but I was severely disenchanted with anything the Wachowski brothers would do after the poorly done sequels but certainly V For Vendetta turns that around. James McTeigue, a Wachowski lackey and newcomer director creates a brilliant political and dark world of futuristic terror and revolution.Natalie Portman delivers one of her most brilliant and important roles as Evey, a young woman, the daughter of revolutionaries trying to just live her life until she has a run in with a very mysterious masked man known only as V. Portman as Evey goes through such a powerful transformation. She reflects the changes in their society and the rebirth or awakening of a nation. Her performance is breath taking and riveting and she should be given great acclaim in this role. Equally as powerful is Huge Weaving as the masked anti-hero V. Weaving is best known as none other than infamous bad guy Agent Smith which I didn't realize until after the film was over. You won't recognize him or his voice but he does an incredible job. Through the guise of a mask he still creates this dark, deadly, emotional figure that you feel terror, pity, sadness and love for all at once. Is V a hero?? Well that's really the ultimate question behind this film. In essence V is a terrorist, in some ways he is no different than the extremist terrorists we known nowadays going beyond the normality of battles to fight for their causes. Stephen Rea is also brilliant as the disillusioned detective who investigates V's murders across London but slowly begins to realize there is more to his world than he ever knew. John Hurt and Tim Pigott-Smith both make very evil and real world dictators of the new world ravaged by disease and wars.V For Vendetta clearly lays out the world before this revolution without getting into too much detail. By using subtle characters, and news flashes we get a very real sense of the world, enough to easily take a position on the revolution unfolding. The film is entirely fictional and brutal in it's action and gore and yet one of the most political and intelligent films I have seen this year. This man was tortured by the system, abused by the government and now sets out to exact revenge for not only himself but the rest of the world as well...for people like his new ally Evey, her parents, his cell mate, everyone. In that way he is a hero and a revolutionary but are his tactics terrorist?? The question still haunts me...is he right or wrong in his ways?? Regardless he is a brutal enemy to be up against with his incredible sword play and martial arts and makes short work of everyone. Evey and V have great chemistry and you feel a devotion and love between them. In many ways the story could be compared to Phantom of The Opera, a masked man, scorned by society falls in love with a woman he can never be with. No matter how you look at it Vendetta is one of the best films of the year to date and I would love to think they might serialize this although Wachowski brothers have disappointed with sequels before. I think there is much more of a back story to be told here. Action, political, drama, romance and an intense story...this is definitely worth seeing, a great movie for grown ups that is a legitimate intelligent action film. 9/10",9,3,7,7 April 2006
The Island," A blast of an action movie!!
","The Island looked great right from square one...to me anyways. And then I started hearing all the negative reviews and even the cast was shunning the movie and the makers of the movie were blaming the cast for the poor turn out...I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm glad I gave it a chance because The Island turned out to be a great action, sci-fi film in the same vein as Total Recall or other great futuristic action films. Michael Bay is no stranger to the action genre. He has created some of the biggest and best action thrillers. As far as I am concerned The Island continues his tradition of greatness.Ewan McGregor stars as Lincoln Six Echo who appears to be trapped in a fortified underground city that protects survivors from a deadly breakout that wiped out humanity. As it turns out none of this is true and instead Dr. Merrick has created thousands of clones for the rich in order to save them when they need medical help. McGregor plays naive very well and although I'm not usually a fan of his, he does a decent job. He makes a great hero and he's easy to root for and his performance is well done. The heroine of the story is played by Scarlett Johansson who also I am not usually a fan of but for the first time really enjoyed her performance as fellow clone Jordan Two Delta. McGregor and Johansson's chemistry is quite good together and they make a great action team on top of that. The rest of the cast is also well placed including veteran screen bad guy Sean Bean as Dr. Merrick. Steve Buscemi also has a small role as the guy who helps the clones escape. Djimon Hounsou plays the bounty hunter of sorts who is set on the job of bringing the clones back to the fortress or destroy them before anyone learns of their existence and he becomes quite the anti hero but he performs a great role. Everyone plays their role in the storyline which really covers a lot of ground and always explains everything. It's an intriguing sci-fi film with a rather scary look at the future. And if you think you've seen car chases...NOTHING compares to the intense highway battles that are done in The Island. They are brilliantly choreographed and filmed (highly recommend watching the special features on the DVD) and are just brazenly terrific.The film incorporates some of my favorite aspects of a sci-fi film. The naivety of these underground clones getting used to the 'real world.' (something along the lines of Demolition Man), a very realistic look at what the world could become and an intriguing epic storyline. As with any action movie it also heavily requires you to leave reality at the door. There are the typical heavily laden action film plot holes, and things that are truly just unbelievable or too vast for reality but that's what makes action fun!! So if you can leave that sense of....oh yeah right, come on....and just enjoy the film then you will find The Island to be a great sci-fi action flick and I can't believe it didn't do much better and I don't understand the negative feedback I heard it getting. I do however don't quite understand the title. This film has such little to do with 'The Island' that it throws people off. There is never really even an Island in it. So call this movie...Clone Wars...oh wait McGregor already did that...well you won't be disappointed in this one if you like all those things that it is!! 9/10",9,3,5,28 December 2005
Furious 7," Finally watched The Juggernaut of Fast and Furious films
","I remember vividly when this came out. Due to Paul Walker's death it was all anyone could talk about and it went on to gross over 1 billion dollars. Well in an effort to binge this franchise I finally watched it. So far my favorite of this series has been Tokyo Drift and Fast 5 but Furious 7 holds it's own. The makes of this franchise know what people want to see and this delivers even more of it. The action is non-stop, the stunts are ridiculously insane and the characters are over the top macho versions of themselves. The ending was also a very sweet memorial to Paul Walker. Jason Statham makes for an incredible villain that I actually think they underused just a little bit but he still is great in his role. Vin Diesel is exactly what everyone wants him to be in the film and he is great at it. I don't particularly see why this instalment seemed to be so massive compared to the others but then I also get at an enormous run time and the scope of the action that this is as close to action-epic as you get. It was definitely a fun watch and gets the adrenaline pumping and is anything but boring. I also think previous cast members Gal Gadot and Sung Kang were definitely missed as well and Ludacris and Tyrese Gibson were underused. Still, consider me a fan of the series and this one was a must see on that list! 8/10",8,0,1,1 May 2019
The Godfather," REVIEW #500....a celebration of sorts on a film that is truly a classic in every sense of the word
","Ladies and gentlemen, I happen to think that this is a major milestone in my film review career. This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10/10Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!!
