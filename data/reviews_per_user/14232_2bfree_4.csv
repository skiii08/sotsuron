Requiem for a Dream," What's so great?
","I noticed that this movie got a high IMDB rating as well as some critical praise, so I decided to give it a shot.Honestly?  It's not anything special.  It's basically a rather graphic flip-book of how drugs and addiction will destroy your life.  Well duh.  It wasn't emotionally evocative and didn't strike me as powerful at all, despite its explicit nature.Also, the style would be interesting if you were a film student, but in practice it doesn't work.  Audiences should be allowed to generate their own thoughts, instead of having the film beat them in through their eyeballs.Bottom line: If you're clueless on the effects of drugs, see it.  If you've seen 'Pi' and like that style of film, see it.  If you're looking for something that will make you laugh or cry or angry or awestruck, or something that has a story to tell, or something with characters you can relate to or empathize with, do yourself a favor and pass on 'Requiem for a Dream.'",5,0,1,29 May 2001
Pearl Harbor," Watch it for the bombing sequence
","Don't miss this movie because you heard that the history is inaccurate, or that the love story is poorly told, or that the characters are cardboard. These opinions may or may not be yours (they're not mine), but nevertheless, 'Pearl Harbor' should be seen because of the impressive attack sequence.I've heard that some of the veterans of Pearl Harbor who have seen this movie thought the attack appeared a bit over-the-top, which is probably true, but it does do an excellent job of conveying the sadness, helplessness, and confusion of the event, of seeing all the destruction and wounds inflicted and lives lost, in particular the drowning of all those people trapped within the Arizona.  What an emotionally intense sequence, and I can only imagine how much more magnified these emotions were of the people who were actually there.The love story was so-so; you do empathize with the characters.  But, it doesn't really relate to the actual attack or serve any grand purpose in relation to the war.  Rather, the relationships were explored only as book-ends (beginning and end), and that's probably why it doesn't seem to work very well.  That, and I felt that the triangle was a bit... twisted.So, check out 'Pearl Harbor' for the actual event itself.  For the attack sequence alone, this movie is worth watching.  You do get a love story on the side, which you may or may not enjoy, plus some extra patriotism (for Americans) with the Doolittle Raid retaliatory airstrike thrown in there, as well as a nice portrayal of the great President Roosevelt.",7,0,0,3 June 2001
Moulin Rouge!," Probably not the musical you are thinking of
","The word 'musical' usually makes me think of those films from vintage cinema or those Disney animated films.  Moulin Rouge is not like this. The movie's tone is a bit more serious and contains suggestive dialogue (as it should be considering the setting).  The musical numbers are a mix of both modern-style original and adapted songs such as Whitney Houston's 'I Will Always Love You' and Madonna's 'Like a Virgin.'  But, make no mistake -- neither the songs nor the score contain heavy rock-n-roll or electrics; think more along the lines of a full orchestra.I thought the music worked well for this movie and offered a different style of storytelling than the norm.  It had a pretty interesting musical-within-a-musical plot.  The movie itself did seem visually hard-hitting and disjointed at times, especially in the beginning, but it does settle down once the love story gets going, and an emotional one it is.Don't dismiss Moulin Rouge because of your predispositions, because chances are they don't apply in this case.  It's not your typical musical.  Also, it's not so much like Luhrmann's 'Romeo + Juliet' -- you can like one and not the other.",7,0,0,2 June 2001
Shrek," 1/2 Great, 1/2 OK
","The first half was fantastic!  We got to see all of our favorite fairy tale characters in glorious 3-D animation.  Very funny, and highly entertaining! The Gingerbread Man totally stole the show!And then there was the second half.  Eh, nothing to write home about.  It's basically your standard Disney-esque fairy tale love story (which I'm sure was the point... ).I wish they would have done more with Lord F.'s gathering of all the fairy tale creatures.  Overall, Shrek is pretty short and could have used more background story; nonetheless, it is a treat for the entire family.",8,0,0,29 May 2001
