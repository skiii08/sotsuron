Iron Man 3," Wow, such a huge fan of IM and this was such a huge disappointment
","Pros: Not many, the new MK suits were interesting, except for the hero suit that dominated the movie. MDJ was funny but the character did many things that were not consistent with previous versions. Some of the action scenes were very well done and full of visual and audible goodness.Cons: The MK42 was supposed to be the latest and seemed more like a drunk dial experiment. The suit was always breaking and not working as expected. Somehow runs out of power, but the arc reactor is just fine not even mentioned. I am usually easy on movies but this one I felt I could poke holes in almost every scene. The ending is just stupid. 3D was non existent, i don't need it but if you say its in 3D at least have it look 3D. I went back to Iron Man I several times. I would not recommend seeing this film even at the budget movies.Sorry to say Iron Man jumped the shark, the parties over. I don't know how it has gotten a 7.9 on IMDb, I read 12 pages of reviews and only 3 or 4 in total had anything good to say. Can you say artificial inflation of the score?????? That is so scummy, but goes right along with this movie. They have lost a true fan.",4,3,6,4 May 2013
Across the Universe," Great if you are a Beatles fan... really good if not....
",I thought this movie was brilliant. It moved with good pace and told an interesting story. The plot was somewhat lost at times but the great voices made those moments enjoyable. Speaking of the music the score and singing were fantastic. I am not normally a musical lover but this movie pulls you in and tells a very nice story in song. And don't get me wrong it's not like they sang the entire thing. There is dialog mixed with the singing. I felt the the visuals were really well done as well. I was very pleased with all the scenes and even when it got 'artsy' I was entertained. I don't give out many 9s and I don't usually comment on movies here. So for me to put this effort in must mean I liked it. I took my 18 year old son who loved the movie as well. This is a must see for any Beatles fan!,9,1,4,19 October 2007
