Blade Runner 2049," Very good modern sci-fi movie... not even close to the original film!
","So, after a lot dithyramb from many team-mates of my office, I thought to watch it this weekend (Friday actually) AFTER I watched again the original 'Blade Runner'......Nope. That's not 'Blade Runner' film. It's a very good sci-fi film, with SOME TRIBUTES to the 'Blade Runner' film, but it's not a modern 'Blade Runner'.Had no same feeling, no same atmosphere, no same drama, no same/similar music, no same/similar screen-play, nothing alike.So... for sci-fi fans... watch it and enjoy. For 'BLADE RUNNER' fans... just pass by.",6,1,3,8 December 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A SUPERB 'Deja-Vu'! As best as the 'origina' trilogy was/is!
","Nostalgia... 'How great the old Lucas StarWars films they were' (Episodes 4/5/6)...We have the 'new' trilogy (Episodes 1/2/3), filling the story, but not as good as the old trilogy was. They didn't have that 'smell' of the old one - even if the birth of Darth Vader from Anakin (in 3rd Episode) was marvelous.Episode 7th was a good effort... but that's all about, a good effort, not a good StarWars film....And what about this one, here, now?REMARKABLE! A 'GEM', no question about it!Well, the producers & directors had less difficult job to do, as Episode 7 had to do. In Episode 7, they FIGURED the story how maybe will be. In this one, an episode BETWEEN Episode 3 & Episode 4, it fills perfectly the gap! In Episode 4, we're reading in the beginning's yellow text (that disappears in deep space) the story of 'Rogue-One'. Just few lines... And then, in the end of Episode 4, just before the final assault on 'Death Star', Mon Mothma (the Rebels leader) is telling to the pilots that 'many Rebels died due the process, to get this plans into our hands'.And that's it, WE HAVE A STORY to tell!'Rogue-One' is set FEW DAYS BEFORE the opening scene of Episode 4 began. In 'Rogue-One', the Rebellion exists, the Empire exists, ALL THE MAIN characters of Episode 4 exists (!), DARTH VADER exists (and... he's amazing, for these few 15 or so minutes he appears!), the original StarWars feeling exists... ...it's an authentic StarWars film, period!!!In the beginning of the film... you'll may surprised (no spoiling, just saying). And you'll turn to your mates right and left of you in the cinema and ask 'hey, what's going on? What's this?'... And you'll FIND OUT WHY the beginning was like this, at the end of the film.The story is a bit slow for the first 40 minutes, because the director wanted (I suppose) to fill all the 'puzzle' of young Erso's (main female character) background/story. WHEN 'AN INCIDENT' happens (no spoils, just saying),... well... you feel like you stepped into a... Ferrari cockpit and you pressed the gas all the way down and you didn't let it go!!! The action starts like a F-14's afterburner... and keeps burns to the end, more and more!If you know (or remember) the story (from the other films), you may not expect Jedi knights to see - it's not a spoil, just remember. In the end of Episode 3, the last Jedi knights flee and gets cover in the four corners of the galaxy, while in Episode 4 ONE Jedi appears to Luke (the old Kenobi)... So, don't expect light-saber duels. But EXPECT light-saber action! (There is STILL ONE 'Jedi'... well... Sith Lord!)The film is dramatic, thnk God for that! No, you won't see like in Episode 7 ...an old grand-pa Han Solo and an elder Chewbacca along with a young inexperienced girl and a coward ex-stormtrooper to... set a whole Imperial base to hell! Here... is TRUE war! Here, they do BLEED,... a lot! And they suffering... a lot! And there is also dramatic ending, as there is 'A New Hope'...(These are not spoils, you know from Episode 4 that it was VERY DRAMATIC mission, to steal the plans of 'Death Star').And... yes... for the love of God... and for the flavor of MILLIONS of StarWars fans, we DO HAVE (AGAIN) our ultimate character of ALL films, of ALL times: VADER... IS BACK!Truly... mark my words... just don't see the film, go sleep into the cinema and tell your guy next to you... to wake you up ONLY when DARTH VADER appears (about 7 minutes in the middle of the film, and about so - 7 minutes - and the end of the film). EVEN IF YOU WATCH ONLY THESE 14-15 minutes... you won't regret it, ever, in your life! Especially the last 7 minutes... well, is the BEST DARTH VADER APPEARANCE in every StarWar films, ever made!(I probably had... orgasm, during that last 7 minutes of the film!)I'm a huge StarWars fan; I'm 47 years old, and I was fortune to see (in cinema) the first film (Episode 4) in the single Greek/Athenian cinema, back then... After the movie, I remember (I was 7 years old) that EVERYBODY was talking about that remarkable 'Dark Evil Lord'... The film was about the good lads (heroes), the good lads won... but all of the people were talking about that dark-clothing tall, 'cold-blood', extreme evil character... ...And yes, after all these decades, DARTH VADER is by far the GREATEST character of StarWars... and perhaps the greatest 'bad-guy' ever created in the History of Cinema....And, HE'S BACK! He's alive! He's amazing!!! Mark my words... this Darth Vader's appearance, will write a new history in the legacy of StarWars.(Jesus... why you made SOOOOO FEW scenes of him?! He was amazing! We could 'enjoy' a quarter minutes more, for sure!)...Music was amazing,... cut-scenes were amazing,... battles EVERYWHERE (urban, terra, close-contact, you name it) were amazing,... the OLD CHARACTERS were amazing (thnk God for the CGI in modern cinema!), everything was fantastic.The only thing it wasn't so good, was the screenplay of the actress with the main female character. She was good, but she may could act better - or the casting could find a better one. She was good, but not as the rest great parts of the film. That's why I gave 9, instead of 10 stars....Epilogue... this is a remarkable film! You need to go NOW, I mean... stop reading, book a ticket, FLY NOW to this 'galaxy, far far away'!",9,1,8,19 December 2016
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Follows a bit the SW feeling, but is not a good SW film.
","I was worried about SW saga, when Disney took over the SW brand.
Disney is THE amazing firm to create a marvellous/amazing fantasy story... but not so good to TAKE AN ALREADY amazing story and move it forwards......First of all, seriously BAD CHOICE of Director & Writer!!! I checked their previous works and... seriously? These people to deal with a SW saga tittle???? It's like me (a 25+ years experience designer) to tell me to take over a... finance company to WallStreet! These people were NOT CAPABLE to direct or WRITE a good SW story...So, the BIG ISSUE of this SW is the SUPER SIMPLE & SILLY storyline/plot/scenario! C'mon... even my young daughter could write a better (far better) scenario. Why Disney didn't hired a SW 'fan-boy' (so many millions fanatics around the world) and he/she would write an amazing story - not this stupid, boring story.Few (or a lot) reasons, that ruined this film - and probably the next following SW tittles:1. Silly, boring, flat storyA space... race to no where, when the Imperials found the Rebels during... light speed (seriously? Not even a five years old would thought that silly thing)... but they continue their attack to Rebels with... cruising speed for 2 film's hours!!!!!Fin and Rose left the Rebel fleet... to go somewhere else to find someone to break the code... and they returning back to the space-chase! Oh, c'mon, will you?!POINTLESS and BORING story. Disney proved that they know to create their OWN FANTASY stories but they CAN'T CONTINUE OTHERS' (Lucas) stories...2. Unbelievable spoiling GOOD characters (killing them)Killing Snoke? And LIKE THAT? Why the hell for???? You have a GREAT EVIL character to DEVELOP HIM FURTHER... and you ruining him like that??? A so powerful evil Sith Lord... and he didn't figure out the... turning light-saber next to him??????? Seriously???Killing Phasma??? WHY? Another great evil character to develop further... and your ruined her LIKE THAT? Not even an epic end, just that stupid scene? WHY?3. Destroying COMPLETELY Luke Skywalker's characterOkay... I understand... you want to wipe-out the past and delete the previous characters (H.Ford demanded to 'kill' Han Solo, and we saw it), you killed Luke, obviously Leia too in the next SW (since the actress passed away). WHY YOU RUINED/DESTROYED Luke's character like that??? Not only how you 'ended him', but... you ruined what Luke is all about: a true unique 'PALADIN KNIGHT', pure honest, pure good, he resisted to Emperor, to his father THE ULTIMATE Force-Man Anakin-Darth Vader... he didn't killed almost nobody in Juba's lair...
...and you make him to try to ASSASSIN HIS NEPHEW IN HIS SLEEP??????
Seriously???????... WHAT 'GENIUS' thought that????You totally destroyed what Luke is - you made him stupid. And... why he didn't fell to the Dark Side, since he tried to MURDER A TEEN student (Ben Solo)?????4. RayC'mon, will you?... 
Anakin Skywalker is the ULTIMATE CHARACTER in a films' Saga. He's the ultimate hero-anti-hero, the 'Sophocles Oedipus' of StarWars...
He took A LIFE TIME to became the powerful Jedi-SITH he became!
Luke, his soon, too... almost a life time to become the Master Jedi he did......And Ray took ... a weekend in the island... to became the MOST POWERFUL JEDI ever lived?????? SERIOUSLY????? What are we, MORONS???
To WHOM you made this film and character (Ray), to NEW YOUNG BOYS they never ever watched SW film before??????Ray became... Darth-Vader...Anakin...Luke...Yoda... combined all of them together!!!! I don't know why she couldn't just... wipe out the entire 'First Order' fleet just with her mind - they (Disney) probably left that to the next Episode!SERIOUSLY?????? A junk-rider young girl... transformed in a weekend... to the most powerful FORCE person of the Galaxy????? Without a SINGLE training?She took over 3-4 WELL TRAINED Pretorian Guards??????? And also stood hard against a... well trained Jedi-Sith like Ren????????? Seriously?????5. Kylo RenYou didn't developed him further. You just left him as he was/is. And HE IS THE ONLY 'EVIL' CHARACTER LEFT in these new SW Episodes!!!!! WHY?You just made (the actor) to ...work out a lot and create a muscular body, thats all!Personally, I think THIS character (Kylo Ren) is the MOST BORING Sith Lord I ever saw or could imagine!... We had Darth Vader, back then? Well, Kylo Ren is like comparing a... Fiat (him) car to... a Ferrari (Vader)!!!!!6. ALMOST TOTALY LACK OF THE FORCEOkay, we saw SOME Force in this movie... but almost the entire movie all the 'Force Characters' where fighting each other like... LA Gang members, not like Force-Persons!!!!! WTF, Disney???? We didn't see ANYTHING!We SUPER-ENJOYED that 5 minutes last scene in 'Rogue-One' (personally I had... multiple orgasms!!!!) with that AMAZING DARTH VADER scene...
...and we thought in this film will see EVERYTHING from the Force...
...but NOOOOO, we saw almost nothing! WHY?7. Focusing on extra-actors / characters meaninglessHan Solo originally was a nobody, a smuggler. But, Lucas developed his character to a MAJOR one. In 'Force Awakens' & now, Fin hasn't developed at all (he's simply a deserter) or Poe (he's just a good pilot) or that useless new Rose (she's simply an nobody engineer)...
...And WHY, the film is focusing SO MUCH on these nobodies - since they are NOT developing their characters to something more interesting???
...That Del Toro's character. Totally useless, a nobody, that will forget after a month.8. Useless/meaningless scenes - like the CasinoOkay, they wanted to make a 'political statement' about the few super rich people and the depressing of the poor (the kids)... but why we needed to spend SO MUCH TIME on that meaningless scene? Or other scenes, like the meaningless 'travel plan' scenes of the island? That shows LACK OF SCENARIO!!!! They simply DIDN'T HAD figured what to do and how to fill the film....I could write for ever, but doesn't matter.
That film was a 'STAR-WARS BASED' film, but not a StarWars film.
It looked to me like those TV Series Episodes from different directors, when JJ made the previous film-story and the new now made HIS OWN 'Episode' almost NOT FOLLOWING what JJ introduced in 'Force Awakens'!Generally... the MOST POOR Direction and TOP-POOR writing, this film has.
That's the WORST of all for this film - NO DIRECTION, NO SCRIPT!",4,1,2,21 December 2017
Logan," Five stars just for Hugh's acting, that's all.
","Okay... so I figured, Hugh told them 'fellas, I'm tired, I'm older than used to be, I can't continue playing Wolverine for long'. Okay, got it......And made THAT 'finale' for this HUGE comic character???The scenario is full of 'wholes', larger than... North & South Poles' ones!!!! We left Wolverine around our time (present) and we 'jumped' to... 2030, without almost anything to explaining us HOW WE GOT THERE, how X-MEN disbanded, how (and WHY) Logan 'loosing his power' (seriously?... Not even a 5 years old kid would thought that, to end the movie character!... Logan simply CAN'T BE KILLED, period! Read a damn comic book of his!), how and why Xavier ended like that... who's that clone and how became clone of him... etc....As a movie, is fine, is great. And Hugh KICKS @SSES with his play! NOBODY can reach his play as Wolverine! Wolverine on Big Screen is HUGH... and that's about it, period.But... as a WOLVERINE MOVIE... nope, sorry, it's not that good as most people saying and keep ranking high this film.And as a HUGE fan of this comic character... I was expecting QUITE LARGER FANTASY for the script writer, to 'end' him.",5,3,7,8 June 2017
Braveheart," Nice film to spend your time...
","...but this film is perhaps the one with most historical inaccuracies, ever!!!First, the NATIONAL HERO of Scotland William Wallace wasn't a poor peasant taken by an uncle to visit... Rome or Paris. There was a Wallace HOUSE, the man was NOBLE. Not too much important, not so much rich, but wasn't a 'simply nobody man' as the film portraits.Second, obviously, he didn't had emotional/sexual relationship with the... Princess of Wales, the future QUEEN OF ENGLAND!!!!! King Edward's son was a moron, a stupid arrogant lad,... but there is no evidence that he was a homosexual - as the film wants to mock him.Third, the Scots did fighting 'painted' like that. That was the traditional way of fight of THE SCOTTISH ANCIENT ANCESTORS, the 'Picts'; which a nickname from the Latin word 'Picti' which means 'PAINTED' (FOLK). The Roman Legionaries started calling them 'Picti'/'Pict', because the ancient Scots were fighting NAKED with full body paint job (traditional paganistic protection designs)! And the colour was dark-blue or black, nothing like that cyan of Mel Gibson.Fourth, the modern MARK of Scots, the 'kilt' skirt with the clan 'tartans', were found around 17th century, 'just... few' (four!) centuries later! There were NO CLANS/HOUSES' specific clothing or emblems, in the era of Wallace.Fifth, the Sterling Bridge battle took place on... guess what?... a BRIDGE!!!! That was the (clever) plan of Wallace. There was a SINGLE semi-stone-semi-wooden VERY NARROW bridge, leading folks from Northern England to Southern Scotland. The English army had to use that narrow bridge to cross the river and invade Scotland and THERE was the place Wallace abused them. The (much more) greater army had to be a narrow line of 2-men-weight and cross the bridge... which was an easy task for the waiting Scots on the other side of the bridge! They also used the 'schiltron' formation (a pack of men carrying large lances/spears) and they massacre the English army.In the film, they do have a 'short of schiltron' formation but they're facing the HEAVY UNDEFEATED ENGLISH CAVALRY... in open field!!!!!! They would CRASH the Scots like a bowl of crapes!Five, they showing (as the Scots) the English having UNIQUE ONE design of uniforms, as a modern army. Nope. NOBODY HAD unique single design uniforms at that era! Not even in Napoleon's era, they didn't had unique single design, but many many designs (and most of the times, the men were confused who was the enemy on the battlefield).(Its the same 'classic' mistake they're doing in US CIVIL WAR films!!!!! They're always showing the North wearing the dark-blue uniforms and the CSA Rebels wearing the Grey! Nope! Everybody was wearing HIS OWN CLOTHING, mostly grey-BROWN clothes. SOME Northern Regiments had the famous dark-blue uniforms, but only at the late of the war. And most of the GENERALS (North & South) had the VERY SAME UNIFORM, the early-days WEST POINT grey uniform, which BOTH (North-South) were wearing the same, since they both were students of the ONE ONLY MILITARY academy!)...I could write for ever. As I wrote in the start, this film has the MOST historical inaccuracies, ever! But... but... still, remains one of the MOST ENJOYABLE films I ever watched.And VERY EMOTIONAL!!!! Even if you are not Scot, you'll cry in many scenes! Especially in the very LAST SCENE (no spoils)... which I'm crying like baby EVERY time I watching the film!Overall? Horrible Historical film... but AMAZING to watch it.",7,2,3,21 October 2019
