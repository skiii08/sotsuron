The Longest Yard," good entertainment for the whole lot
","it's a good entertainment for the whole lotAs we know its a relative to former movie mean machine in which the convicts play soccer against guards and win over them, but in this movie we see they play NFL which is more challenging and more aggressive and more like a battle than a game where convicts wanna take revenge on the guards.As compared to former version this appeals in lot of ways the direction, the screenplay, the action, star cast.......etc The longest yard' is the template for good comedy with some action. Few films achieve are made like this, but in the end, it is surely not the best. In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre. So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of this action packed comedy. Any one will enjoy and will be satisfied for they have paidcheers",10,1,4,14 June 2005
