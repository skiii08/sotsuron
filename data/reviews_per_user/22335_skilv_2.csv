Hereditary," Spine tingling, slow burner.
","This movie gets you thinking!
Loved the acting from Toni Collette & Alex Wolff.If you want a genuine scary experience, settle down, hit the lights and pay attention.The scene where the deceased grand mother is standing in the corner will be the first thing I think of whenever I think of this movie.As will the scene where the seemed to be possessed mother is in the corner of the sons room watching him wake up from his sleep.Must watch.",8,2,4,9 October 2018
The Exorcist," The Scariest Movie Of All Time.
","Exactly what the subject says.This film truly has a way to frighten you, regardless if you are a person of faith or not.There will never be another film like this.If you have not seen this, please - watch, pay attention and enjoy.",9,3,5,9 October 2018
