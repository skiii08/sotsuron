Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Give it a chance! (spoilers)
","The Star Wars trilogy is such a holy of holies among film fans that George Lucas must have had nerves of steel to go ahead with his long-held plans for the prequel trilogy. The news that a new chapter was on the way was ridiculously exciting, even to an on-again/off-again casual non-fan like me, but the immense build-up that came before it was followed by a crushing disappointment as I sat through two hours of nothing-much and a gibberish-spouting lizard-fish pratting around like Sylvester McCoy. I saw it again a week later in the hope anticipation had crippled its chances, and second time around it challenged Return of the Jedi for third place in the franchise.Set 32 years before A New Hope, The Phantom Menace details a young Anakin Skywalker's entry into the Jedi as a trade federation controlled by Darth Sidious attacks the peaceful planet of Naboo. Here we find a young Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master, Qui-Gon Jinn, despatched to reach a settlement and protect Naboo's elected Queen, Padmé Amidala.It sees a return to directing for George Lucas, a hugely under-rated director. Twice nominated by the Academy for his direction, twice nominated for his writing, he may not inspire the greatest performances from his cast but his films look beautiful. Every shot here is beautifully framed, beautifully photographed. And while dialogue has never been his strong point, The Phantom Menace is superbly plotted; we have the re-emergence of the Sith, the crippling of the Galactic Republic, the defeat of Chancellor Valorum, Senator Palpatine's ascension to the Chancellorship, Anakin Skywalker's entry into the Jedi under Obi-Wan, the first meeting of Anakin and Amidala, of Threepio and Artoo, and the grotesque Jabba giving the Hutts a presence across all six films.The Star Wars universe succeeds because of its detail; the lightsabres, the Tie Fighters, the Imperial Walkers, and The Phantom Menace introduces some of its greatest assets. The Battle Droids are my favourite element of all the films, Darth Maul's make-up is astonishing, his double-edged light sabre pant-wettingly exciting and, of course, the character names are as great as ever. The new hardwear fits well with the original trilogy, the clean lines and bright colours of the Naboo starfighters and cruisers contrasting with the beat-up ships of the rebel alliance. With the exception of the midichlorians, everything it adds to the established universe fits perfectly. A notable highlight is the depiction of the Jedi, here in their prime as keepers of the peace. The lightsabre fights in the original trilogy come from an old guy past his best and a young Jedi wannabe on work experience. Here we have two knights at their peak fighting an agile Sith who makes Darth Vader seem like he had his shoelaces tied together.It's hard to review The Phantom Menace without addressing the criticism it's attracted. Despite being the highest-grossing of all the Star Wars films  and ticket sales at least suggest popularity if not quality  it's assumed that everyone hates it. It deserves to be defended against criticism that is mostly unfair, often uninformed. A lot of the criticism comes from people lacking the foresight Lucas has for his empire. When Episode III is released and the audience no longer has to join the dots, The Phantom Menace will stand a better chance of being seen as a slow-boiling first act that sets up the epic story with considerable skill.The dialogue is wince-inducing in places, but is grand and broadly mythic; certainly no worse than in the Lord of the Rings films. At times the CGI looks less than real, the fields of Naboo impossibly green, the skies impossibly blue - but impossible only to our polluted frame of reference. For the most part the effects are remarkable and deserved to take the Oscar from the one-trick-pony that was The Matrix.The much-criticised title fits nicely with the B-movie hokum of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The weakest title in the franchise is easily A New Hope, an uninspired and now uncharacteristic addition. I do agree, however, that the finale is underwhelming; a small-scale repeat of the assault on the Death Star, victory relies on a kid making a mistake and Jar Jar Binks falling over.Mr Binks is, of course, the biggest problem. He undermines every scene he's in and destroys much of the darker tone that creeps into the second half of the film. But let's at least remember that people initially hated Threepio in A New Hope and the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi; it's only our collective rose-tinted nostalgia that remembers otherwise.What frustrates me is that much of the criticism levelled at The Phantom Menace belongs equally to the original trilogy. Think Ewan McGregor's bland as Obi-Wan? Try Mark Hamill. The dialogue's awful? Harrison Ford said of the first film, 'George, you can type this but you sure can't say it.' Natalie Portman's just there to look pretty? Think Carrie Fisher's gold bikini. Daul Maul is underused? Think Boba Fett. We've seen the finale before? Return of Jedi resorts to a second Death Star! Let's lose the idea that the original trilogy is perfect. Before The Phantom Menace was released people considered Jedi to be a weak finish and the Ewoks an annoying marketing tool. Now suddenly it's as perfect as New Hope and Empire! I won't buy into that kind of revisionism just to better criticise the prequels.For all its faults, The Phantom Menace remains a remarkable achievement. Four films into the franchise, 22 years after the first film, George Lucas is still showing us new worlds and finding surprises in a story we all know inside out. When the prequels are finished and all six films tied together, I hope The Phantom Menace gets the re-evaluation it deserves. In the meantime I'll enjoy it alongside the original films, happy that I can see the prequels as their equals.",8,1,2,30 July 2004
Unbreakable," Wasted ideas, terrible pacing.
","I was one of the seven people on the planet who didn't think much of The Sixth Sense, so I had no real interest in seeing M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up, Unbreakable.  I have to admit that my instincts were wrong.  I walked into the movie thinking it would be only an average film, a time-passer and nothing more; imagine my surprise when it turned out to be absolute crap.  I was bored almost immediately, and the only thing stopping me from walking out was that I wanted to write a bad review of the whole film and not just the first half hour.It was excruciatingly boring, suffering from one of the worst cases of plot constipation I've ever seen.  Everyone spoke too slowly, with quiet voices punctuated by longs sighs, and with big pauses between sentences.  By an hour into the movie, I was finishing the lines in my head before the actors had reached their third word.  It was so, so slow.  This worked well enough in The Sixth Sense and helped to make the occasionally spooky atmosphere, but here it was laughable and slowed the movie down even further.  I'm not an impatient viewer, I'm not the kind who gets bored if there's not something being blown up on screen, but this was relentlessly, frustratingly slow.Aside from its dull delivery, the dialogue wasn't natural at all, and didn't go far enough in the other direction to be impressively stylised.  It was just stilted, and too obviously tried to explain the plot, as if Shyamalan didn't think we could work it out for ourselves or had doubts about its credibility.  Where one line would have been enough, we were treated to four or five that said the same thing or made the same point.It's hard to go into details about the plot because its power comes from surprising the audience and would be easily ruined, but there were some great ideas in it and a great twist at the end that were completely wasted by being fed through the Sixth-Sense-O-Matic.  It was filmed so much like its forerunner that it spoofed itself, ruining and belittling its own ideas. If the point was to put a superhero into real life it didn't work because this movie isn't like real life at all.Shyamalan needs to try something different on his next movie if he is to convince as a major talent, and stop making it look like he films everything in a library.  What makes great directors great is their versatility, not necessarily in genre but in style; Hitchcock stayed mainly with thrillers but his direction was rarely predictable.  Like Andrew Niccol, Shyamalan is an imaginative writer with great ideas but I'm not convinced he makes it as a director.The overwhelming impression is that this was a great idea wasted by its execution and funeral-procession pacing.  I can't explain just how badly the time dragged; imagine tying bricks to a clock and having a lazy tortoise pull it through setting concrete.  When the end credits started to roll I felt like I'd been paroled, and I couldn't make it to the doors fast enough. That said, when Shyamalan's next movie appears I'll see it because I'm convinced that his imagination will eventually lead to a great movie.",Null,0,0,20 January 2001
Dawn of the Dead," Pointless (spoilers)
","The history of cinema is littered with missed opportunities.  A great idea is let down by too small a budget.  A literate script is rewritten for popcorn-swilling idiots.  A poor cast wastes its good dialogue.  With an endless supply of films crying out for a second chance it's frustrating that Hollywood is determined to only remake its successes.  They may talk about retelling a story for a new generation, but cinema is eternal and its stories are forever available to every generation, so we know they're only interested in remaking the original film's money.Here we have Dawn of the Dead, an entirely pointless remake of a film regarded as a genre classic.  As the dead rise and develop a taste for scrummy live flesh, nondescript humans with as much character as the gormless corpses take shelter in a shopping mall.  Here they fend off fatal attacks of the munchies and take a few swipes at our culture of consumerism. At least, they did in the original.  In the remake they hang out at a coffee place and chat.There is a staggering lack of atmosphere.  Here we find ourselves surrounded by death, by walking corpses wanting to tear us apart, and there is no tension, no eeriness, no suspense.  If it weren't for the gallons of blood you'd have no idea you were watching a horror film at all.  Shot as an action movie, played as if you adjust to a plague of zombies after ten minutes, it's astounding that a film with this much gore and this strong an idea can be so dull.Its characters are three-dimensional, realistic and well rounded in some kind of mirror universe where hot snow falls up.  In ours they're pitifully underwritten.  One guy is Surly, one is Sarcastic, one is Pretty Decent. The others are Nothing At All.  They apparently have names.  Mekhi Phifer, a natural charmer and one of the few good points of ER's shark-jumping later seasons, is wasted here in a nothing role and a silly and predictable subplot.  Character development only comes in the form of montage.  I slipped out of the cinema to the bathroom, and when I came back the mean guy was nice and most of the cast had paired off!  The idea that we're supposed to care about these nobodies, hope they don't get munched on and make it to the end credits alive is ridiculous.  It's like trying to be emotionally attached to a chair or a bucket.The original film had a degree of intelligence not often found in horror films, and it's certainly nowhere to be found in its remake.  The shots of zombies stumbling around a shopping mall while muzak and taped announcements play unheard were priceless.  The lead characters' gluttony and gradual loss of interest in living a meaningful life in place of their consumer paradise was an interesting (if over-praised) point.  In this remake the satire is lost.  Of course it's lost.  The mall is just a location, a background on which blood will splatter, and your brain won't have to worry about thinking anything beyond `That looks cool.'  There might be an attempt at satire in the brief scene where a security guard gormlessly plonks himself down in front of a TV instead of taking care of the zombie problem, but if that makes any point at all it was probably just an accident.  The film's irrelevance and poor sense of social commentary is further exposed when you realise that a mysterious virus is killing people all over the country - possibly all over the world - and the word `terrorism' isn't spoken once, even to dismiss the idea.  In The Day the Earth Stood Still there is a conversation where an American family wonder if the little green men are actually big, Red and earthbound.  It's a throwaway moment that points to the paranoia of the time.  No such intelligence here.The only areas in which the remake surpasses the original are the visual effects and the zombies themselves.  Here they are animalistic, predatory, consistent in their strength and speed, and actually able to run.  These changes make for more formidable opponents, but the increased threat is not matched by increased tension.  And it's strange that, despite Mr Computer giving us shots of cities on fire and thousands of zombies lining the streets, there is a lesser sense of apocalypse than in the small-scale original.This isn't a film that needed to be made.  It adds precisely nothing to the legacy of the franchise.  It won't be remembered.  The history of cinema will be no richer for it.  And meanwhile more opportunities are being missed.  More good ideas are being cut by a low budget, more scripts are being dumbed-down, more dialogue is being wasted, and no second chance will come for these films because remaking them won't guarantee a good opening weekend.",Null,0,0,29 April 2004
The Jungle Book," Ignore the cynics - this is classic Disney
","The last time I watched The Jungle Book, I thought for about half a second that King Louie was a rather uncomfortable stereotype.  Given that white racists love the phrase `Get back to the jungle' and make comparisons to monkeys, a scatting orang-utan who desperately wants to be like a man seemed like either a dated character who'd never heard of political correctness, or a deliberately racist one who sat rather awkwardly among the otherwise saccharine sentiments.  But after reversing my lobotomy, I realised just how much I was talking out of my a**e, because Mowgli, who this awful, shameful black stereotype sings to, isn't white.  There's that theory shot to pieces. Add to that the fact that Baloo the bear scats alongside Louie, and that bears haven't been given the racist association that monkeys have been saddled with, and it becomes pretty obvious that people are reading into Louie a perversion that simply isn't there.  After all, if Louie is a racist character, then every British viewer should be disgusted to find that the villainous, murderous, savage Sher Khan is given an English accent despite living in a jungle in the middle of India.  My point being: shut up.The same point goes for people who've complained that the female character who attracts Mowgli is desperately sexist because her song shows that her only ambitions are to be a wife to a handsome man and a cook to her children.  That argument ignores not only that this was a movie made in the 1960s, where a career girl was still far from the norm, but that it wasn't set in the present day anyway!  If Mowgli had spotted a girl on her way to the office where she'd compete with the best male executives on an equal salary, the movie would have entered a fantasy land less realistic than the one in which a bear can sing.In truth, The Jungle Book boasts the kind of charm and innocence and magic that we used to associate with Disney ourselves, before the company began telling us about its charm and innocence and magic in every advert for every video it rams down our throats.  It's this genuine Disneyism that makes The Jungle Book a classic despite its wafer-thin plot.  Mowgli, a man-cub raised in the jungle by a family of wolves, is to be returned to the man-village to keep him safe from Sher Khan, a tiger whose fear of man's gun and fire, and whose links with the notorious Combat 18, make him a dangerous addition to the local population.  From there, the movie spends the remainder of its running time wandering around the jungle rather aimlessly, and its episodic structure means the movie sags at times while soaring at others.Every scene with Baloo is a winner, and the King Louie episode is perhaps the most entertaining, but these are dragged down slightly by two rather repetitive scenes with Kaa the Snake, whose career hit its nadir with his infamous appearance with Britney Spears at the MTV Awards.  Your enjoyment of the two scenes with the Dawn Patrol depends entirely on how funny you find a forgetful elephant, and on how well you can forgive Colonel Hathi's crypto-fascist, militaristic obsession.  The lowest point is the sequence with the Beatles-lookalike vultures, managing to include the poorest characterisations, the least memorable song, and the most half-assed of ideas.  The vultures are clearly a nod to the Fab Four, but only one speaks with a Liverpudlian accent, and when they break into song, it's in the style of a barbershop quartet and not a rock and roll group.  The homage is therefore compromised and becomes pointless.But The Jungle Book is more than the sum of its parts.  Its highlights may be unevenly distributed, but nothing can argue with the fact that I didn't stop smiling through the whole thing.  Baloo is the absolute star of the film, one of the great Disney characters that ranks alongside Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket and Mulan's Mushu, and it's his presence that accounts for most of the film's immense charm.  He has the best song, the best lines, and the best scenes, and his loveable slobbiness can't be praised highly enough. Even his entrance, where he strolls onto screen singing `Well it's a doo-be-de-doo, yes it's a doo-be-de-doo' is inexplicably hilarious!  I know it's not the greatest line of dialogue in the history of cinema, but it makes me laugh every time I hear it.This is simply classic Disney.  Great characters, great songs, stunning animation, and a heart to shame most of the vacuous 90s output this generation has had to suffer.",Null,3,5,28 December 2001
The Exorcist," Oh no, the devil's coming to get me! Hee hee! (spoilers)
","Some movies simply have to be seen, if only to understand what all the fuss is about.  Citizen Kane is one of them, The Godfather and Raging Bull are probably a couple more, and The Exorcist is another.  When it was re-released in British cinemas after a generation-long ban, I felt obligated to see it.  After all, this was a movie so scary that you weren't actually allowed to watch it.There were always stories going round about it; when it was first released, people fainted in the cinemas, one woman had a miscarriage because she was so scared...  But the Chinese Whispers don't represent the movie at all. The Exorcist is not the scariest movie ever made.  For a lot of it, I was trying not to laugh.The first hour or so was great, genuinely unsettling and creepy.  Noises in the attic, and candle flames rising up then going out made for a tense build-up.  But once Linda Blair's possession became more obvious the movie lost its ability to scare and became only laughable.This fault lies not so much with the movie but with me.  As an atheist it's impossible for me to be scared of the devil because I don't believe in him. This doesn't come from small-mindedness; Luke Skywalker doesn't really live in a galaxy far, far away but I can still love the Star Wars movies, but films that deal with religion can't be seen in the same way because they believe they're telling the truth.  This isn't a fantasy, this kind of thing really happens!  People get possessed, the devil is evil, and only God can stop him.  That's laughable to me, and that is inescapable.I know Christians who are so scared by the concept of this film they don't even like to talk about it, let alone watch it.  I envy their fear, because it would have made for a great horror movie.  As it was, it was nothing. The church is laughable and outdated to me, and so too was The Exorcist.Moments such as the possessed girl masturbating with a cross should have been shocking, but I thought they were great.  It put a smile on my face to know how many religious people would be offended and outraged.  Freedom of speech is forgotten when it comes to religion: in England we still have a blasphemy law; there are no atheist programmes on Sunday mornings in amongst the Christian shows.  Atheism is always under-represented because it is seen to be offensive, so blasphemy is always refreshing when it is finally voiced.  But I can't even praise The Exorcist for its blasphemy, because it was there only as proof of evil.  These were the kinds of things I was thinking when I should have been scared.Atheism isn't the only thing stopping the movie from working.  The biggest problem was that the devil was funny.  His insults were great, coming up with the ultimate `your mother' joke.  The pea soup vomit is embarrassingly fake and the shaking bed looked like something from the Fun House at the end of Grease.  I hate saying that dated effects can ruin a movie, but they really do this one no favours at all.  Any credibility that may have remained was lost.Despite these criticisms, I can't say that The Exorcist is a bad film.  It didn't work on me, but I know why, and I understand why so many people would see this as the scariest movie ever made.  Even with its technical flaws this must be terrifying to people who believe in the Evil that takes over Linda Blair.  Like all religious horror, it was wasted on me because its basic concept was laughable rather than scary.  Like Citizen Kane, The Godfather and Raging Bull, The Exorcist is a disappointing, over-rated movie.",6,1,4,25 January 2001
JFK," A true masterpiece
","I was fourteen or fifteen when I first saw JFK, and its passion gave me a passion not just for the assassination conspiracy but for history in general.  I'm now writing my dissertation on Kennedy as part of my history degree and there was an irony in seeing the film again - the film that had got me interested in the first place - because I couldn't help finding fault with some of its conclusions.JFK argues that Kennedy was killed because he had wanted to pull America out of Vietnam and ease relations with the Soviet Union, something that the military-industrial complex simply wouldn't allow.  It was this idea that I had problems with because it was Kennedy who had sent over 15,000 American troops to Vietnam, and who may have provoked the Cuban Missile Crisis because of overt and covert moves against Castro.  I was worried that this would ruin the movie, but historians argue so endlessly and I've changed my own mind so often that I just ignored the would-be niggles.  Besides, if the facts don't necessarily support this idea of Kennedy now, it was undoubtedly the perception at the time so may well have been the motive behind the assassination.There are further problems that pedantic historians have complained about; a number of composite or fictional characters, genuine testimony transplanted to fictional locations, and the use of both real and recreated archive footage combine to undermine its credibility.  These, too, can be forgiven because JFK has a responsibility not just to provide facts, but to provide a coherent narrative, and it would have been impossible to have uncovered every word that was spoken during the Garrison investigation or kept them in their original context.  A degree of manipulation and invention was necessary.  Without these compromises, JFK would have lost much of its atmosphere and been a far weaker film, so I was happy to let them pass.Even with these criticisms, JFK remains a masterpiece, by far the best film from occasional genius Oliver Stone.  I can't think of any movie that has the same sense of urgency, of outrage and passion, and such determination to convince.  Adapted from two books, the screenplay is perfect and is testament to Stone's skill that he could take the masses of evidence and turn it into a coherent script, with co-writer Zachary Sklar.  Following District Attorney Jim Garrison, the only man to ever bring a suspect to trial in the murder of the President, the film is utterly convincing in its criticisms of the Warren Commission Report and in its presentation of the conspiracy behind the assassination.It boasts perhaps the greatest ever ensemble cast, including Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Walter Matthau, Sissy Spacek, Laurie Metcalf, Ed Asner, Jack Lemmon, Gary Oldman, Brian Doyle-Murray, Wayne Knight, John Candy, Donald Sutherland, Bob Gunton and Jim Garrison himself.  The last name, in the role of Earl Warren, should prove that, contrary to popular belief, Stone has a fine understanding of irony.  The weakest link in the stunning cast is Costner, but he gives his best performance in the lead role and manages to avoid his wooden delivery for most of the mammoth running time.  Even when he stumbles, he carries the movie perfectly.His performance is certainly enough to make the final forty-five minute courtroom scene the greatest and most electrifying I've ever seen.  We are bombarded with evidence of the conspiracy, of the Warren Commission cover-up, of the convenient deaths of witnesses and critics, and are shown the notorious `magic bullet' theory and the terrible footage taken by Abraham Zapruder.Within his air of excitement at revealing the conspiracy and his determination to find his truth, Stone never forgets the truth that everyone can agree on; that Kennedy was not just a President, but a man, who was murdered as his wife sat next to him.  Whether you believe the Kennedy legacy or not, it is a hard heart that doesn't break to see the final bullet strike him, to see his wife reach out across the boot of the car to rescue the debris, and to see his young son salute his father's coffin as it passes.  The respectful tone that is taken throughout is perfect.Historians should be grateful to Oliver Stone for bringing history to a wider audience, one that a documentary simply would not have reached.  Its flaws are necessary to this end, and when Stone himself talks of his film in terms of a counter-myth, you realise he was not merely in search of the truth, but in search of other people who seek the same; this should be the only starting point.  JFK is a film that should make you angry and make you ask more.  For me, at least, it did both.",10,3,15,25 February 2001
Coyote Ugly," Hollywood at its worst (big, big spoilers!)
","The Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer partnership, which had spawned such corkers as Crimson Tide and The Rock and such crap as Top Gun and Days of Thunder, was disrupted somewhat by the untimely death of Simpson in 1996. But aside from the company logo, nothing has changed on-screen since then. If proof of their soulless, mass-production technique was needed, this is surely it; with one half of the team dead, the artistic content hasn't changed in the slightest!Coyote Ugly, though a Bruckheimer solo project, has the worst features of the brainless 80s fantasies that were the team's trademark.  It is a film so banal, so puerile and so immature, that it could have been written by its teenage target audience.  Only a 13-year-old could be convinced by its glossy tale of hardship, only a 13-year-old could be surprised by its ending, or interested in anything that comes before it.The constantly pouting Piper Perabo plays Violet Sanford, a small-town gal who wants to make it in New York as a musician.  Her dad doesn't want her to go because it's a scary place, but she moves anyway and finds success isn't as easy to come by as she'd imagined.  It's genius, isn't it?  You can imagine the writer suddenly being hit by inspiration, jumping for joy as the idea forms in her mind, realising this is a story that has never been seen before and simply has to be brought to life on the big screen, then waiting six hundred years for cinema to be invented.I've honestly never seen a movie so wholly dependent on cliché.  There is literally nothing original in this film.  That's not sarcasm, it's not petty sniping or an exaggeration; literally, actually, undeniably, nothing. Every last moment is predictable.  Anyone surprised to find Perabo's apartment small and badly decorated has never seen a film before.  Anyone amazed by the burglary or disappointed by her lack of success in the first few minutes is as stupid as people who think `Baby on Board' stickers actually prevent car accidents.For the pre-pubescent girls in the audience there is a love story shallow enough for them to relate to.  The supposedly-charming Adam Garcia is the love interest, and the will-they won't-they tension that surrounds the fledgling couple is diminished slightly by him being the only man in the city she actually talks to!  We should probably assume the script said there was chemistry between the two leads, but it never made it past the page - they are both gorgeous, and that seems to be enough to convince us they're a good couple that we should be rooting for.  But this is a romance so infantile that when Perabo first meets Garcia, he follows her through the dark streets of New York at night, says he's staring at her ass, and she finds it charming!There are attempts at gritty realism and at showing the hardship and heartbreak of having your ambitions frustrated, but these don't last beyond the second reel.  This is Bruckheimer, and realism was never on the agenda. The few scenes that show us the bad breaks in the big city are followed by a cheesy ending and a happily-ever-after for the lead characters that render them insincere.  It follows the three-act structure precisely, giving us first the ambition, then the hard times, then the triumph.  I yawned my way through all three.This movie should be held up as the example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood.  It's cynically unoriginal, painfully infantile, constantly banal, and so vacuous it could suck the audience out of their seats and into the screen.  There are so many reasons to hate this stodgy turd.  Seeing Garcia buy rare Spiderman comics in a diner is one of them; seeing the character whose soul purpose is to ask what Coyote Ugly means is another; and suffering the shameless cameo of LeAnn Rimes singing the crappy theme song is the most irritating.  I hate this movie, I resent it wasting a hundred minutes of my life, and the only thing more annoying than a film so ruthlessly efficient, so pointless and so banal, are the preteen idiots who actually like it.",Null,0,0,5 October 2001
Singin' in the Rain," A good movie but no classic.
","If you closed your eyes and threw a potato into a crowded street, you'd be guaranteed to hit someone who loves this movie. Everyone loves this movie. Just looking at the other reviews here, it's hard to find anyone who thinks it's anything less than a masterpiece. I guess I'll just have to be Billy No-Mates, because I found it to be significantly less than that.Whether you've seen it or not, you've at least heard of it and been made aware of its reputation, but as is so often the case, its reputation overstates its virtues. But while it may have been a fair distance from the five-star masterpiece I was expecting, it was still a good, and sometimes great, movie.The first thing that struck me was Gene Kelly's smile. Cheesier than a statue of Celine Dion carved in Gorgonzola, it simply refused to leave his face. He seemed incapable of frowning, and typified the mood of the movie. Its relentless cheer and optimism was infectious, and it is easy to understand why so many people describe it as a feelgood film. No one could be miserable watching this.There is an unavoidable quaintness in the film. Set in the 1920s, as silent movies gave way to talkies, it both celebrates and gently mocks a legendary era in Hollywood history. But the movie itself is now part of another legendary era in Hollywood history, and this double-nostalgia works only in its favour and adds to its immense charm.The cast is excellent without exception. Gene Kelly is great, and Donald O'Connor is just hilarious. He seems to be having the greatest time in the world making this movie and making em laugh. His face-pulling scene is undoubtedly one of the funniest moments the film has to offer. Jean Hagan is perfect as Lina Lamont, and gives us a truly original character. The scene where her terrible voice is revealed was lessened somewhat by having seen a similar joke in The Man with Two Brains, but this deserves the laughs having got there thirty years earlier. Her stupidity is at its funniest when she insists she and Kelly are an item because she was told so by the gossip columns, and she is blessed with perhaps the funniest line of the film: `Why, I make more money than... than... than Calvin Coolidge, put together!'It may be stating the obvious, but the dancing was just mesmerising. Kelly and O'Connor move as if on ice, and their energy is just stunning. To see real talent like theirs, and then switch to the jerky, simplified arm-waving that appears in every video on MTV, emphasises their genius. The songs, however, were something of a disappointment. With the exception of the title track and Make Em Laugh, they are nothing special. There were times when they felt forced into the story rather awkwardly, with Good Morning being the most irritating example.I can understand why so many people love this film, but I have no love for it myself. It was fun, and there were a load of great moments, but it didn't come close to being a masterpiece. I know I'm in the minority. For most people, it's a flawless classic. Like most of Cher, it will live forever, and that's fair enough. There is a long list of classic movies which have all disappointed me, and this was by no means the worst offender. I just wish I could have liked it more.",Null,3,5,27 June 2001
Life Is Beautiful," An inaccurate fantasy that brings you closer to real life than anything else
","When you're taught about the Holocaust in school, it's impossible to comprehend the scale of the tragedy.  When the teacher writes `six million' on the blackboard it's hard to see past the number.  What we weren't taught was that the Holocaust wasn't about numbers, it was about people.  Six million people like your mum and your dad, six million of your friends, six million people who had mums and dads and friends of their own.  Life is Beautiful gives us the intimacy that the numbers can't translate, and for the first time, it becomes more than words in a textbook talking dryly about the unimaginable.The first half of the movie lets us see the lives of the three lead characters, before showing us how easily they can be destroyed. Writer/director Roberto Benigni is immensely charming in the lead role, and it's sad to see him sucked into the predictability of Hollywood.  They loved him in the movie, they laughed at the Oscars, but they'll only ever see him as a novelty item.  Don't expect any lead roles in mainstream American cinema any time soon.  The chemistry between Benigni and real-life wife Nicoletta Braschi holds the movie together, and their son is so adorable that the audience will fight over who loves him the most.  This domestic bliss and light comedy is surrounded by a growing sense of danger, and the appearance of Nazi officers becomes more frequent as the film reaches its midway point.In this atmosphere, there is a wonderful scene where Benigni is waiting at a table in a restaurant.  The guests are talking about a maths problem introduced into German textbooks, which is soaked in anti-Semitic propaganda.  Their lack of concern and interest makes a powerful point with great subtlety: that the Third Reich wasn't just one man.  Before the seizure of power, the Nazi party had been immensely popular, and Germany's history of anti-Semitism had begun long before Adolf Hitler rose to prominence.The second half of the movie is where its genius becomes more obvious, but where its historical accuracy becomes more obviously flawed.  Guido (Benigni) and his family are taken to a concentration camp, and the only way he can explain the situation to his son is that it's a surprise for his birthday.  He then turns it into a game, explaining that if they get the most points they will win a tank as first prize.  This made me consider something that hadn't ever crossed my mind.  How did they explain it to the children?  It's impossible even for adults to truly understand the Nazi years, so how can they begin to explain such evil to children?Their concentration camp is bizarrely relaxed and spacious, and Benigni is allowed to walk around fairly freely.  This is where most of the criticism comes from; that it trivialises the experience.  But while it doesn't show the full horror, it shows it on a level that the audience can understand. That Guido retains his imagination and humour has also been criticised, but it's too easy to see every prisoner as a broken spirit.  This shows that resistance can be in the mind, and that it is no less powerful for being hidden.This movie embraces the idea of history from below, that by looking at the experiences of `real people' you can understand the nature of real life within history.  The Nazi years weren't just about torture and book burnings; when the books were seized and burned, how did it affect the reading habits of the German population?  Did they read less often, or read only the books that were left?  This idea is the key to Life is Beautiful, and you can forgive it its inaccuracies for giving us a personal experience that can then be generalised.The ending is truly heartbreaking, and finally `six million' makes sense. Guido, his wife, and their son, were just three people, but we now understand that there were six million more just like them, who were all braver than we will ever need to be.",8,2,4,22 December 2000
To Kill a Mockingbird," A flawless adaptation of a perfect book (spoilers)
","To Kill a Mockingbird was the first book I ever connected with fully.  I had lost myself in a story before, but never so completely, never with such an emotional response to the characters and their fates.  For the past few years my health has stopped me from reading, and this is the book I have missed the most.Seeing an adaptation of a book you love is always hard, because you have to trade your imagination for that of the director and screenwriter.  I know what Scout looks like to me, I know what Jem and Dill and Atticus sound like, I know what it was like to live in Macomb and to be scared of the Radley house.  I was nervous watching the movie, hoping the producers would not lose or betray the spirit of the book, but their imagination was mine and everything in their adaptation was near-perfect.Like the book, the film is narrated by Scout and is played to perfection by Mary Badham.  She captures Scout's tomboy spirit wonderfully and is at the absolute centre of the film.  It's always refreshing to see a child actor who isn't sickly or over-cute or wooden, and the same can be said for Jem and Dill.  Gregory Peck's Atticus was as he should be; quietly idealistic, passionate without really showing it.  He won the Oscar for his performance, and while it was probably deserved, the kids outshone the adult cast effortlessly.It would have been easy for the film to have followed only the trial of Tom Robinson, an African-American charged with the rape of a white woman, but it would have killed the spirit of the story; the trial was just another part of Scout's childhood.  She played with Jem and Dill, she saw the trial, she went to school for the first time, and she finally met Boo Radley.  This approach gives the movie its quiet, understated morality and gentle dignity that made the book everything it was.It brings with it the powerful contrast between the innocence of childhood and the uncomfortable realities of the adult world, most famously in the scene where Scout talks to a lynch mob on its way to kill Robinson.  It makes these points perfectly, never overstating them, never forcing them down your throat, telling only the truth.The story's power comes in its refusal to find easy answers, in its willingness to bring tragedy to its characters, and the movie captures this perfectly, with the same kind of understatement.  It is really a wonderful adaptation.Inevitably, some details of the story were left out, but most of the important ones were there, with only the children's growing friendship with Boo Radley given less attention than it may have deserved.  That is the only criticism I can offer.Until I can read again, I'll love this movie as I love the book.  It was a peerless adaptation.  If you don't love it for its gentle storytelling and quiet, understated idealism, your name is John Grisham and its depths are wasted on you.",Null,2,4,17 January 2001
Shrek," Vastly over-rated
","The 1990s was a strange decade for the Disney corporation, one which saw huge commercial success in its first half, and creative bankruptcy in its second.  Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and the Lion King were a hat-trick of classics that matched critical success with financial reward, but what followed was a series of repetitive features which proved the winning formula was being so streamlined that nothing else remained.  In Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, we saw only a misfit who dreamt of being understood and a sidekick or two ready to chip in with the one-liners.  Even the more satisfying efforts, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Mulan, were burdened with the same old formula.  The theme of the underdog and his sidekick had long been a staple of Disney's output, but there had always been something more, something that elevated it above its repetition.  Now the bare bones were being presented as the living, breathing whole, and the feeling of déjà vu was becoming increasingly irritating.With Disney's offerings looking as stale as one of Lincoln's home made baps, and with the arrival of computer-generated animation, its rivals had their best chance yet at defeating the sleeping giant.  But somehow the opportunity was not matched with films of sufficient quality; The Pebble and the Penguin, Anastasia, Antz, Titan AE and The Road to El Dorado did little to fill the potential gap in the market.  If the response to Disney's stagnation was slow it can be easily understood given that animated features take three or four years to produce, but, still, an opportunity was being missed.In the Spring of 2001, patience was rewarded with Shrek, a CG animation from DreamWorks which wooed the critics, busted blocks and snatched the first ever Best Animated Feature Oscar from under Disney's noses, leaving poor old Walt spinning in his grave faster than a bottle at a pre-teen sleep-over. It was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch it, ready to embrace the cynicism and subversive humour that had been praised so highly.The story of an irritable green ogre sent to rescue a post-feminist Princess began well enough, starting, as so many Disney movies have started, with a book of fairytales being opened and narrated in a non-threatening tone. Suddenly, Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers, tore a page from the book and wiped his butt with it - a promising start.  Unfortunately, it hinted more at its level of humour than at its subversive nature; the jokes begin in the toilet, and there they remain.  The jokes about belching were outnumbered only by the jokes about farting, both of which were abandoned only once, for the high-class humour of seeing Shrek being hit in the groin.Further disappointment came in its feeble attempts to ridicule Disney's monopolistic use of fairytale clichés.  If a film is going to rubbish its predecessors it has to be smarter than the ones it attacks, but Shrek should have a dunce's hat plonked on its big, dumb, empty head.  Like Scream and Galaxy Quest, it comes across as being ill-informed, pointing out some clichés while blindly serving up others with a short memory and a straight face.  Beyond that, the same old Disney sentiment it spends the first forty minutes rubbishing comes on thick and fast in the second half, where we learn that beauty is only skin deep, that friendships should be valued, and that blah blah bliddy blah.Beyond fairytale cliché, Shrek suffers terribly from a mammoth helping of movie cliché.  Jobbing writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio serve up a story of complete conventionality, making us endure such lines as `It's quiet... too quiet' and having their wafer-thin plot hinge on a half-overheard conversation, a plot device so old it was invited to God's christening.Its various faults add up to a missed opportunity, its subversive streak as unconvincing as Mike Myers' Scottish accent.  Disney has its faults - now more than ever - and it deserves to be ridiculed, but it has to be done by something altogether smarter than this.  After all, Shrek is the misfit who dreams of being understood, Eddie Murphy's Donkey is the sidekick on hand to chip in with the one-liners, the Princess teaches us that beauty is only skin deep, and nothing is more Disney than that.",Null,1,2,5 September 2003
Gladiator," Yet another over-rated classic
","Whenever a new Ridley Scott movie appears, I can hardly contain my indifference.  He's way too variable in terms of quality for me to get excited about a new release: Alien is a great movie, Thelma and Louise is nothing special, White Squall is pants, and G.I. Jane was surprisingly good, but I'm the only person who seems to think so.  With this track record, as I walked into Gladiator I was less expectant than Adam Sandler on Oscar night. It turned out to be worse than I thought.Gladiator is an epic-by-numbers.  Sweeping shots over cities, a couple of thousand extras wearing togas, a few seconds in a battle scene where the music turns to silence and the direct-o-matic uses a different shutter speed...  Seen it all before.  While everyone else was dropping their jaws, my thumbs got busy with the twiddling.If you're going to make a movie where the audience can root for the underdog, you should at least blur the lines a little.  Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained.  For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe.  He gets fired from his job, sentenced to death, manages to escape only to find his wife raped and his children murdered, is sold into slavery, forced to perform in front of bloodthirsty crowds as a gladiator, loses his car keys and steps on a dog poo.  For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth.  It's as balanced as a see-saw with Jabba the Hutt on one end and Calista Flockhart on the other.It has pretensions above the action movie it knows it really is, and it's at those points that the film moves from boring to laughable.  We're told, over and over again, that gladiator fights are brutal, that  the crowds are disgusting for watching, and that the men are unwilling to take part.  It was at this point I phoned Amnesty International to see what we could do to stop this barbaric sport.  Are we really learning anything by this?  It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious.  While the viewers are weeping at the injustice of it all, they're also excited by Crowe's muscular heroics, and the slo-mo, pop-promo style used for the bloody fight scenes.  We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator.  Is he the only one fighting against his will, or are the people he kills innocent victims too?  Who cares?  We've moved past the pathos now, we're on to the fight scenes.  Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.The ending is as predictable as possible.  Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power?  The only good thing about the ending was that it actually had one.  Three weeks into the movie I was starting to have my doubts.  Overlong, over-rated, add it to the list of undeserving modern classics.",4,1,2,22 December 2000
The Birds," Hitchcock is just sick, sick i tells ya!
","As is the case with Psycho - the classic made directly before this film - The Birds is a story that can be split into two halves.  Where Psycho gave us Janet Leigh's getaway before turning its attention to Norman Bates, The Birds gives us Tippi Hedren's practical jokes before letting the winged freaks terrorise us.As is also the case with Psycho, the opening thread works well enough on its own, so that the gentle romantic comedy and Hedren's practical jokes feel like well-developed set-up rather than padding.  Hedren is effortlessly charming, and her smoker's voice is cute and occasionally sexy (before it was passed down a generation to become irritating).  The chemistry between her and Rod Taylor seems genuine enough, and the unspoken tension that comes from his ex-girlfriend and overbearing mother add depth to the characters. It seems strange that so many reviews complain of the wafer-thin story; these are details and depths that would be hard to find in the set-up of most modern movies.Having Hedren's character as a practical joker is a nice touch, as most people know Hitchcock was a bit of a trickster himself.  You get the idea he's sniggering to himself behind the camera, thinking `my jokes are a lot meaner than hers!'  His sense of humour is perhaps more prominent than ever, and leads to my favourite shot in the whole film; as Hedren drives badly along winding roads, we see her love birds clinging on to their perch, leaning to one side and then to the other as she swerves all over the road. It looks incredibly fake but it's just such an inventive idea you laugh with it rather than at it, which I suppose was the point.Once Hedren's flirting with Rod Taylor begins in earnest, and the story moves to Bodega Bay, the film begins to lose its similarities with Psycho. Whereas the shower scene in Bates Motel changed the tone of the film instantly, here we are witness to a rather slow build-up and an impending sense of doom.  The tension is built with predictable expertise, so that things that shouldn't be scary genuinely are; when all you hear is a flapping of wings it's scary, when all you see is a bird landing on a climbing frame it's scary.  The effects have aged quite badly, but they are no real barrier to the tension and fear you will feel, although you probably get more from the film if you're not too keen on birds already.  While I haven't got a phobia I could live quite happily without their flapping wings and biting beaks so all the movie's tricks worked on me.As other reviews have pointed out, the most noticeable difference with Psycho comes in what we are allowed to see.  Shadows and chocolate sauce were enough to scare in Psycho, but in The Birds we see everything, including a horrible shot of a corpse whose eyes have been pecked out.  It is testament to Hitchcock's skill that he could approach these movies so differently and have them both work so well, each scaring the audience in their own way.The ending is deliberately abrupt, and I'm not quite sure if I liked it or not.  It was a nice idea to suggest that this wasn't the end of the story, just the end for these characters, but as with most older movies the absence of an end credit sequence means there is no time within the film to think about it.  It was probably a little too abrupt, but it is hard to see how else it could have ended.My main recommendation for the film is that for a few days after seeing it, I noticed loads more birds than usual on the wires and rooftops outside my house, and felt rather suspicious of why there were there.  I'm sure Hitchcock would have wanted it that way.",Null,0,0,26 February 2001
The Wizard of Oz," I tried to hate it, really i did (spoilers)
","Don't touch me.  I'm a hideous, hideous freak.  Somehow, I managed to live for twenty-two years without seeing The Wizard of Oz.Don't hate me.  I'm not a complete freak; I'd seen bits and pieces over the years, but I'd hated most of them.  I hated Judy Garland's tobacco-chewing voice, I hated the gaudy colours of Oz, I hated the simplistic story and the childish morals, I hated the songs, I hated the pantomime feel of it all, I hated the Munchkins' singing voices, I hated pretty much everything about it, and thought of it as just another over-rated classic.Sitting down to watch this properly for the first time, I was looking forward to writing a bad review, because they're more fun to write.  My plan was scuppered when I realised I loved this movie from start to finish. Damn!Judy Garland is great as Dorothy, managing to be feisty and helpless at the same time, the cowardly lion is always funny, and the tinman and the scarecrow are both charming.  The story is still simplistic, but now I see it as childlike, not childish.  There was a more cynical voice inside my head telling me I shouldn't be liking it, but I managed to ignore it  that voice should learn to shut up every once in a while.It's far from perfect, and even now I think most people over-rate it.  The black and white opening is a little strained as the farm hands are forced to throw in words like `courage', `heart' and `brain' to drop hints about who they'll be when they reappear in Oz.  The wicked witch is a bit hammy, her make-up is unconvincing, and you can see the trap door open before she disappears from Munchkinland.  The did-it-all-really-happen ending is too familiar a twist to be effective or surprising, but these are only points of pedantry.It gets boring reading the clichéd professional reviews that say how this movie captures your heart, but my heart was captured, and for a few days after seeing it I felt happier than I had before.  Like Mary Poppins, Oz is a genuinely innocent, childlike story with great songs, loveable characters and heart-warming morals.  It's such a shame I couldn't hate it.",8,5,7,5 January 2001
