Kill Bill: Vol. 2," not as good as the first
","The story was excellent, Quenton Tarantino the god of modern cinema, Kill Bill vol.1 excellent. So naturally kill Bill vol.2 should be as good if not better, but sadly its not. I got very excited at the prospect of seeing this film especially with the trailers and the tag line: two down three to go. To me however, although at first it was all meant to be one film, Mr Tarantino seemed to rush this movie. some of the fight scenes where lacking and looked sloppy and the simple story and plot took a nose dive into the ridiculous. I found myself regretting seeing this movie and wishing i had let the sequel stay in my imagination. This is the only film in my eyes of Quentin Tarantino's that is bad to watch. this film is a mere shadow of what he can do.",2,1,4,24 December 2004
"I, Robot"," very good
","I enjoy a movie which takes me away from reality, i also like a good actioner. this film is brilliant and takes me back to the days of great action classics such as commando and raw deal. Wil Smith all though a bit woody does his role justice ans the special futuristic effects are out of this world especially the car chase scene. Wonderful. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action films. It may be thin a little bit on the plot but its nice to see a film that doesn't try to be over complicated which seems to happen with a lot of films recently. I have seen this film twice and i am buying it on DVD. The action is smooth and slick and the acting although a little woody is adequate this film is a recommended stocking filler 8/10 at least",9,0,0,2 December 2004
The Bourne Supremacy," absolutely brilliant
","This film was a huge hit for me, in fact in my opinion it was better than the original. Matt Damon reprises his role as the excellent Jason Bourne. The action scenes are breathe taking at times, and the plot is as good if not better than the original. Its Bond meets fast and the furious only better. I watched this film twice on the cinema and i couldn't wait for it to be released on region 2 DVD so i bought the region 1 copy instead. This film is a must for people who like a good action movie, or a good spy movie. This has the lot, it is among my top ten films of the year. its a breathe of fresh air as there has been a lot of stinkers out recently. BUY THIS MOVIE, you would be daft not to.",9,1,2,24 December 2004
