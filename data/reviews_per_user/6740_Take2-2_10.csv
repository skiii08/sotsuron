Shakespeare in Love," A wonderful comedy and romance.
",'Shakespeare in Love' is a wonderful comedy and romance. Joseph Fiennes portrayal of Shakespeare as a young neurotic is ingenious. Geoffrey Rush is hilarious as the penniless owner of a theater desperately racing to open a play that Shakespeare is writing during rehearsals. The acting is terrific and dialogue sublime.,Null,5,8,8 September 1999
Blade," Lots of action and blood make for a good time.
",I love a good vampire movie and 'Blade' fits the bill. The action is fast and furious right from the opening vampire massacre. Stephen Dourff makes a fun villian and Kris Kristofferson is great as Blade's only allie. Lots of action and blood make for a good time.,Null,0,1,27 August 1999
Sleepy Hollow," A creepy, gothic film.
","'Sleepy Hollow' is Tim Burton's reworking of Washington Irving's classic 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. In this version, Johnny Depp plays New York City constable Ichabod Crane at the eve of the Millenium (1799). Crane's superiors scoff at his crime solving methods and send him up-state to solve a series of decapitation murders in the quiet farming town of Sleepy Hollow. Upon arriving and meeting the townsfolk, Crane is immediately attracted to the lovely Katrina Van Tassle, the daughter of the richest, most powerful man in town, portrayed by Christina Ricci. When the town elders tell him the murderer is a ghost, the scientific minded constable can not believe it. This is a creepy, gothic film. The Headless Horseman, portrayed by Christopher Walken, is particularly menacing. The cast does a great job of conveying the doom and gloom of the haunted town. I really enjoyed the stories plot twists and turns, because you're never quite sure where this legend is taking you.",Null,0,0,24 November 1999
American Pie," Don't be fooled by the marketing and hype, this 'Pie' is warm and touching.
","'American Pie' is a funny coming of age film. For all the crude humor, the movie is really rather sweet. Although the boys start out just looking for a good time, they end up finding love and even maturity. The girls are the ones who are in control of the situation. Alyson Hannigan especially offers lots of laughs as a band geek. Don't be fooled by the marketing and hype, this 'Pie' is warm and touching.",Null,1,1,25 August 1999
American Beauty," A profound and powerful look at the disintegration of a 'perfect' family.
","'American Beauty' is an absorbing film. The acting is phenomenal, especially Kevin Spacey as a man who has been beaten down by life for far too long. The film's idea about beauty and life are so acute that the characters sting you with their observations. This movie is a profound and powerful look at the disintegration of a 'perfect' family.",Null,0,0,15 November 1999
American History X," A heart-wrenching exercise in racism
","A heart-wrenching exercise in racism, 'American History X' made me cringe...a lot. Edward Norton gives a performance that goes from chilling to grief-stricken and everywhere in between. A truly a gifted actor who can convey so much emotion with only his eyes, Norton makes the film. It's sometimes difficult to see and hear the kind of hate that this movie portrays however, I think sometimes it's a good idea to get some perspective on the world around us.",Null,0,0,25 August 1999
A Bug's Life," This is a movie that can be enjoyed by children of all ages.
","Visually stunning, 'A Bug's Life' is probably the brightest and most vibrant movie I have seen. It's fast and funny with lots to look at and enjoy. The out-takes at the end are hilarious. This is a movie that can be enjoyed by children of all ages.",Null,0,0,27 August 1999
Army of Darkness," Combining heaping doses of comedy with horror.
","Combining heaping doses of comedy with its horror, 'Army of Darkness' is funny and fast. The silliest by far of the Evil Dead trilogy, I have to admit it is also my favorite. Bruce Campbell is at his wise-cracking best as Ash embarks on his third adventure. Ash as a character has really changed from the romantic, sensitive good guy of the original film. It's just really hard not to enjoy his journey.",Null,1,1,25 August 1999
