The Blair Witch Project," Unbelievable
",It is truly unbelievable that so many people like such a poorly done movie. This just shows how uneducated the average person really is.  I cannot fathom how this movie could possibly make the top 250 of all time.  What are you people thinking?  The Blair Witch Project is the suckiest film I've seen in my entire life.,Null,0,0,10 August 1999
