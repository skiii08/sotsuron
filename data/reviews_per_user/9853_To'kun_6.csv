The Blair Witch Project," Would have been better if the haunted house motif was removed
","Based on what I heard: okay, this film was an experimentalpiece and it was categorized as 'horror.'  I've been a longtime fan of horror films and I've seen a lot of things done inthis media to 'creep' or 'scare' people out.  Blair Witchworks in the creep factor because no one, not even theaudience, is in on the joke; also this film was an experiment on psychological terror than anything else.  Atits basic level, three filmmakers venture into a forest,rumored to be haunted by the Blair Witch.  What they findstarts their road towards the realm of fear.  It is H.P.Lovecraft who states, 'The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fearis the fear of the unknown.  These facts few psychologistswill dispute, and their admitted truth must establish for alltime the genuineness an dignity of the weirdly horribletales as a literary form.'  Sadly,  the movie comes to a big crushing end when traditional cinematic motifs used in the horror genre areused to bring the movie to its mysterious end.  Voices inthe night, children off in the distance, unusual noises andthe haunted house are staples for this genre and the moviefails when it has to use those methods to create  terror.  If itwasn't for the 'haunted house' in the middle of nowhere (i.e.the woods), I would have enjoyed this movie more.  With itthere and the handprints in the house, I had to ask, 'whatthe hell?'   This movie deserves a wavering thumb becauseit works in some levels and is terrible in others.",Null,0,1,25 September 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More myth and less comedy
","The Phantom Menace is not a perfect film, in both a fan's perspective and a mythologian's.  As a fan, I thought the film could have done better without the computer generated sidekick, Jar Jar, and the Gangan race.  I didn't mind the other cg characters or its use in set design as much, because they were used to show a wide variety of aliens existing and give a sense of monolithic proportions, but with Jar Jar, it was more of a thorn in a wonderfully crafted Star Wars universe, whether done by Lucas or Dark Horse Comics.  In comparison, the cute bunny-rat like creatures in the Marvel Comics Star Wars universe were more acceptable.I've never been a fan of computer generated alien races in any film and Star Wars IV to VI never used comedic 'skits' to get the audience to laugh. The humor should be indirectly found in the situations the characters find themselves in and in witty script writing.  The script had a lot of character development problems.  The only character which stood out in both performance and in development is that of Palpatine's.Also, Lucas developed A New Hope (IV) with Joseph Campbell's Power of Myth series in mind (if not influenced by), and that is what made Acts IV to VI memorable.  Instead of building on the myth, in Phantom Menace Lucas presented a history and civilization that has no mythical foundation. 'The Force' is a parascience than a mythical essence -- that is what ruined this movie for me.  The Force was used in the movie more often in the combat sequences than in any other scene.  The Council of Jedi was ruined by having them meet in a concrete room than in a place of Nature.  There is no mystique to The Force and only Yoda was able to impress the mystique of The Force than any other character.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
The Mummy," The Mummy is a return to the style of the b-movies.
","The Mummy is a wonderful camp-thrill ride that will entertain the viewer.  Trying to treat this film seriously is not possible with the humor that is spiced throughout the film and with the campy computer graphic effects that are done on some of the lesser skeletons and mummies running around.  For once, the computer graphics are not overblown to ruin the movie's purpose.  If The Mummy can be seen as a return to the style of the cheap B-movies, with the dimensionality of the characters and the simple plot, the cg effects are used tactfully to give The Mummy a B-movie feel.",9,0,0,12 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Definately better than Episode One
","*minor spoilers warning*AotC was definately better than Phantom Menace for the underlying plot development, but it paled in comparison when it came to pacing, because I nearly fell asleep a few times and it felt like a long movie.  Although, the fact that I didn't get much sleep the night before probably didn't help. ^^;  Overall, the second movie was a valient effort in the digital filmmaking medium that Lucas used; there wasn't that many obtuse moments where the CG overwhelmed the characters and the story.  At least it was used appropriately to render the vast clone armies and a grandeouse battle, much  like Phantom Menace's climatic battle did.  Its use to create computer generated aliens still needs a lot more tweaking to make them look like they fit into the shot; most of the times, it isn't...  That was one of Phantom Menace's flaw.  In AotC, the flaw was the CG-rendered Yoda.  He stood out a few times and while it was required in the climatic battle, this little tyke needed the 3D space to demonstrate his fighting prowness.  If the puppet model was used in the closeups, it'd help make the battle a touch more believable than just simply impressionable. This movie is a must for any Star Wars fan as it brings to light the events that caused Act IV to VI to happen, and I look forward to the dvd release to see what was left on the cutting room floor.",7,0,0,17 May 2002
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A pared down version of the novel.
","* Mild Spoiler Alert * :)Even though I'm rusty in remembering all the events that happened in the book version, I felt that the film made a great compliment to visualizing what are the important parts (and plot moving events) of the book.  Sadly, this leaves very little development in the feud between Hermione and Ron's familiars and very little screen time to fully introduce Sirius Black.  If I remember correctly, Black signed the consent form to visit the village by the end of the novel and nothing is revealed in the film about that.By spending time in glamorizing the CG generated world of Harry Potter, it distracts than getting to the point of the story.  There is a point of doing it in the first movie, the second time around it does get bothersome and the third -- you get the idea. :) I'm glad very little time is spent in the Quiddich matches, which are more heavily prominent in the book series.Sadly, this leaves holes to the overall story and for what purists may consider 'Rowling's Vision that must be put in the big screen' (tm).  I didn't mind the changes made to make the movie, otherwise it would've been a longer movie with dull moments to sit through.  It is something which I think the fourth movie will end up being when considering how voluminous it is; I'll be very curious to see how that will get pared down).",Null,0,0,4 June 2004
The Mummy Returns," a movie with mythical allusions
","*vague mild spoiler warning*First, I must say this movie is not so much a sequel but a*continuation* of the first movie, even though it takes place 8 yearslater.  Alone, Mummy Returns does not work; it requires the moviegoer to know the first film well before seeing it. As for the film itself, it uses some interesting story tellingtechniques that further defines Evie's and Rick's character; theyhave mythical origins.  That is what makes this movie great.  Evieis an important reincarnated Egyptian character from the past andRick is the hero who discovers himself (he realizes his originsnear the movie's end) -- this is stuff Joseph Campbell would talkabout.  To see them riding that hydrogen balloon-boat wasreminiscent of the solar boat that Ra sails in on his daily journeyacross Egypt (i.e. the Sun's daily journey).  The technology used torepresent this image was highly appropriate, in my opinion.  Forthe characters, they are like gods out to do justice and goodagainst the sea of corruption and evil (which Anubis, Imhotep,Scorpion King and Anck-Su-Namun represented).While the CG is not as great as the first movie, there was new stufftried out which doesn't quite work.  The vast armies of Anubiswarriors and Magi soldiers were fine, but the cg work on the mostbasic of tricks (i.e. the oasis jungle as it is being sucked up) justdidn't work for me.  It looked too crisp.  Perhaps if the spfx peopleused traditional special effects methods, the resulting shots wouldhave looked better.  Also, the Rock's final appearance would havebeen better if he was actually there for filming instead of a cgrendered version of him.",10,0,0,10 May 2001
