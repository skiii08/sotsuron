Blade Runner 2049," As Beautiful and Intriguing as Tears in Rain...
","From an original 1982 theatrical showing to a Beta videotape, to a standard laserdisc, to a deluxe Criterion letterbox laserdisc, to a DVD, to a high-definition blu-ray, Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner' has been viewed countless times in the original voice-over version, the European cut, the director's cut, and the final cut over the 35 years that followed its release. All those memories have not been lost in time, like tears in rain, but rather are indelible images from one of the greatest science fiction films. Thus, any thought of a sequel evokes mixed emotions. Despite the involvement of Ridley Scott, the results could be another disaster like 'More American Graffiti,' or an undistinguished but palatable followup like '2010,' or a companion masterpiece like 'The Godfather Part II.' Fortunately, 'Blade Runner' cultists can breathe a sigh of relief; while 'Blade Runner 2049' may fall short of the unqualified masterpiece status of 'The Godfather' sequel, at least on an initial viewing, the film enhances and builds upon, rather than diminishes, the original; however, only time will determine if 'BR2049' will enjoy the same repeatability as the first film and join it as a timeless classic.Fresh from his outstanding work on 'Arrival,' director Denis Villeneuve helmed 'BR2049' with a steady hand and attention to detail, which were likely guided or inspired by Ridley Scott. Set thirty years ahead of the original film, Roger Deakins's career-best cinematography captures a future that is colder and bleaker than that portrayed by Jordan Cronenweth's original work, which has a warmer tone. However, Deakins's cooler hues are appropriate for 2049 Los Angeles, where snow has replaced rain and holographs rule rather than neon. Warm or cool, the atmospherics in both films are equally dazzling. The aurals are as captivating as the visuals; the haunting music by Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch evokes the original Vangelis score without plagiarizing.The casting is also superb with Ryan Gosling spot on as K, the blade runner whose job, like Deckard's in the original film, is to retire renegade replicants. While the role may lack showy moments for an actor, Gosling's tall lean figure and enigmatic face create an image possibly more enduring than that of Harrison Ford in the original. Both Ford as an aging Rick Deckard and Edward James Olmos as a retired Gaff return to link the sequel to the first film. Among the newcomers, Robin Wright is well cast as Gosling's deadly serious, deathly pale Lieutenant Joshi of the LAPD. Ford and Olmos are not the only returnees, an origami figure and a small wood carving wordlessly connect the two Blade Runner films, and implanted memories, flying cars, outsized advertising, and transparent plastic raincoats also have encores.'Blade Runner' cultists are best served seeing the sequel knowing little; the story unfolds as a policeman sent in pursuit of a mystery that expands upon threads in the original movie. Tthe film's length is arguably excessive, especially for those unfamiliar with the original, and 'Blade Runner' novices may be left behind by a leisurely narrative that prizes visuals above action. However, 'Blade Runner 2049' is that rarity of movie sequels, a film that enhances and elevates the original, yet stands on its own as a masterful film. The passage of time will determine if 'Blade Runner 2049' and 'Blade Runner' become the inseparably coupled films that 'The Godfather' and 'The Godfather Part II' have become, but all the elements are in place.",10,14,30,16 October 2017
The Monuments Men," Clooney's Message about the Value of Art and Life
","Is a work of art, even one as irreplaceable as the Ghent Altarpiece or a Michelangelo Madonna, worth a man's life? Especially today, when extortionate museum admission charges reserve art for the privileged few. George Clooney clearly believes the answer is 'yes,' and he hammers the message home as producer, writer, director, and star of his preachy film 'The Monuments Men.' Those dastardly Nazis strike again and loot Europe's museums and private collections with the intention of establishing a gigantic Fuehrer Museum in Germany. The stolen art works are shipped to the Fatherland, where they are hidden from advancing Allied forces, and Clooney and his team are assigned to retrieve and return the masterpieces.With slick production values, the movie resembles a big-budget war movie from the 1960's and has a simplistic old-fashioned quality. The star-studded cast is also a throwback to earlier war films, although the A-list team is largely underused and under-challenged. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Bill Murray, and John Goodman play stock characters, while the charming Oscar winner Jean Dujardin is wasted in a small part. Only Cate Blanchett stands out as a member of the French resistance who has critical information about the missing art; Blanchett alone immerses herself in character, although her rapid attitude shift towards Damon may provoke whiplash in some.Clooney has borrowed liberally from other war films, and references to 'The Battle of the Bulge' and 'The Bridge at Remagen' only remind viewers of even more. John Frankenheimer's 'The Train' visually posed the same life vs art question, but Frankenheimer wisely left viewers to ponder the answer for themselves; Clooney does not trust his audience, but rather answers the question for them several times over. Clooney's use of the melancholy 'Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas' pales in comparison to the unforgettable images that accompanied that song in John Foreman's grim and gritty film, 'The Victors.' Even the Spielbergian sentiment of the final scene evokes 'Saving Private Ryan.' Clooney's team faces hostility from their own troops, who are intent on victory, despite the cost to cultural treasures. Time also pressures them as the Russians move into German territory where the stolen works have been hidden; those nasty Russians intend to keep the purloined art for their own museums as war reparations. However, despite the pressures, the often naive team make time to pat each other on the back and smile smugly, hang American flags to taunt adversaries, stand in awe like schoolboys on a museum outing, and seemingly wander off sightseeing in enemy-held territory. While Clooney does a competent job under all four of his caps, 'The Monuments Men' is a message picture wrapped in glossy trimmings. The film is not bad and retains viewer attention, but some may resent the preachings of a wealthy handsome Hollywood star and prefer to make up their own minds about the value of art vs human life.",7,0,0,29 December 2014
The Finest Hours," An Imperfect Storm
","A cargo ship splits in two during a fierce North Atlantic storm, and the surviving crew clings to hope aboard the floating half, while a small Coast Guard boat sails from Cape Cod on a rescue mission. Based on a true event that took place in the early 1950's, 'The Finest Hours' is at its best when the focus is at sea. However, viewers may initially think they wandered into the wrong theater; the first twenty minutes detail a sappy cute guy meets cute girl for a date; cute girl asks cute guy to marry her; cute girl frets about cute guy in danger. The shallow unconvincing scenes on dry land are set in a faux-1950's and should have been left on the cutting room floor, because this lame date-film wannabe makes 'The Perfect Storm' look like a masterpiece.Chris Pine as the young rescuer, Bernie Webber, finds that navigating a small boat in a storm takes more skill and daring than piloting the Starship Enterprise. However, Pine's performance at sea is far more convincing than his underplayed romantic acting opposite Holliday Grainger, who plays his girlfriend. Grainger plays Miriam, the stereotypical 1950's woman; always immaculately made-up and coiffed in designer dresses, even during raging snow storms. Neither rain, nor snow, nor blistering wind can muss her well permed 'doo nor mar her porcelain make-up. The Miriam character is annoying throughout, and her repeated order to the Coast Guard commander, played by Eric Bana, to call back her boyfriend from danger sounds like the whine of a spoiled petulant teeny-bopper. Led by Casey Affleck, the crew aboard the sinking ship fare better than Pine and Grainger, although some appear too casual in the face of mortal danger.The scenes of the storm and the tossing cargo ship are often exciting as are those that depict the tiny rescue boat facing 70-foot waves. In contrast, the snow storm ashore looks more like a Norman Rockwell Christmas card than a threat. Perhaps 'The Finest Hours' needed an experienced action director, a writer who could pen some decent dialog, and an editor to excise extraneous romantic scenes that add nothing to the action. The ingredients for a thrilling true-life rescue film were there, but some genius decided the studio needed a feel-good date film. 'The Finest Hours' should find its audience on DVD, where viewers can fast forward through the romantic drivel and enjoy the exciting sea rescue.",7,0,7,5 February 2016
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Memorable Cruz, Forgettable Cage in Guilty Romantic Pleasure
","Based on a popular novel by Louis de Bernieres, John Madden's 2001 adaptation of 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' is a pleasing, if flawed, film that may enrage fans of the book. Filmed on the Greek island of Cephalonia and set during World War II, the story revolves around the romance between Pelagia, daughter of a local doctor, and Captain Corelli, an Italian soldier stationed on the island with his company. Romantic entanglements ensue when Corelli is billeted in the doctor's home; Pelagia is already engaged to Mandras, a hunky local fisherman, and danger escalates when German troops arrive to assume command after Mussolini surrenders to the Allies.Enhanced by John Toll's gorgeous cinematography of the Adriatic island and Stephen Warbeck's beautiful score that includes the haunting 'Pelagia's Song' or 'Ricordo Ancor,' which is sung over the closing credits by Russell Watson, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' could have been a classic romance of love amidst war. The casting began well with Penelope Cruz, who is perfection as Pelagia. However, after Cruz, the casting falters, before ultimately flopping. While John Hurt is a stretch as a Greek doctor, his skill as an actor makes him credible in the role. Christian Bale as the young Greek fisherman is a bigger stretch, but he too tries valiantly, although his accent comes up short. The biggest problem is Nicholas Cage as Corelli; while Cage is of Italian descent, he reeks American and is completely wrong for the part. Cage's performance seems as forced as Cruz's is effortless; her attraction to the big lumbering oaf with a bent for opera is unconvincing and leaves the film with a gaping whole at its center. The script by Shawn Slovo abbreviates the novel and also sidesteps a critical point; Slovo cuts the pivotal character of Carlo to little more than a cameo and thus obscures the motivation for a crucial moment in the story.While the film was a major disappointment when the novel was fresh in mind, time has been kind, and, with expectations lessened, the pleasures of 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' emerge. Penelope Cruz is Pelagia, and her lovely performance is the film's major asset. Add the location cinematography, a small role by the incomparable Irene Papas, and the unforgettable song 'Ricordo Ancor,' and many fans of romantic movies may enjoy a film that throws light on a barbaric near-forgotten episode during World War II. Some viewers may also be inspired to seek out the novel, which expands and deepens the events depicted in the film. Otherwise, 'Captain Corelli's Mandolin' can be classified as a guilty pleasure for a rainy afternoon.",8,0,0,3 December 2018
The Notebook," 'Iris' Redux
","One might categorize 'The Notebook' as the ultimate 'chick flick' since there is little in the story to appeal to male viewers.  Not much takes place that has not happened in dozens of other films.  A young man and a young woman meet, they fall in love, they face obstacles, they part, they... Well, if you have been to the movies sometime in the past 100 years, you can fill in the rest.  However, the movie does have a framing device that bears a striking resemblance to the recent bio film about writer Iris Murdoch, 'Iris.'  In the earlier film, however, the story balance was tilted towards the older characters, while in 'The Notebook,' the younger players hold center stage.  The downbeat nature of 'Iris' was bearable because of the towering performances of Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent.  Unfortunately, 'The Notebook' is less distinguished.  While the older pair, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, are seasoned pros and do an able job, particularly Garner, the cast in the earlier scenes are just O.K., although paddling through a Disneyesque lake filled with thousands of white geese and keeping a straight face must require a great deal of acting discipline.  At times the entire film is as cloying as that treacly rippling-water scene despite desperate attempts to be moving and touching.  While 'Iris' rose above its depressing subject matter with unforgettable performances that could break the heart of the most hardened stoic, 'The Notebook' fails to evoke a single tear and turns a similar story into a sappy sentimental 'date film.'",6,2,5,24 July 2004
Milk," Milk has Aged Like a Fine Vintage Wine
","Occasionally a film biography will feature a stellar performance that firmly merges the actor with the person portrayed: George C. Scott as Patton, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln. While Gus Van Sant's 1968 film about gay-martyr Harvey Milk does not strive for the spectacle of those works, his lead, Sean Penn, joins the lofty heights of those other Oscar-winning performers and becomes forever identified with the historical personage. Penn won a well-deserved second Oscar for the role, and Dustin Lance Black also took home a statuette for his literate engrossing screenplay.Using real and recreated documentary footage as backdrop, Van Sant retells Milk's story from his melancholy 40th birthday to his assassination less than a decade later. Before he became the first openly gay person elected to public office in California, Milk felt that he had done little with his first 40 years of life and needed a change. With a good-looking boyfriend (James Franco), he heads west to San Francisco, opens a camera shop in the Castro District, and becomes a local political leader in the city's gay community. The camera shop develops into a political hangout, and, supported by an assemblage that includes Emile Hirsch, Alison Pill, and Joseph Cross, Milk makes several unsuccessful runs for a spot on the city's Board of Supervisors. Ultimately, in 1977, Milk won a fateful victory in the same election that propelled a 'family values' champion, Dan White, well and creepily played by Josh Brolin, into office alongside him.Black's screenplay details Milk's political dances with White, sometimes harmonious, sometimes adversarial. However, the film climaxes with Harvey's greatest victory, the defeat of California's Proposition 6; championed by Anita Bryant and State Senator John Briggs, the bill would have fired all gay teachers in the state. Although knowledgeable viewers will already know the results of the referendum and the tragic end of Harvey's life, Van Sant holds interest throughout, aided immensely by Sean Penn's career-topping performance. Not content with a striking physical resemblance, Penn inhabits Milk's persona with the mannerisms, speech patterns, and body language familiar from the public Milk. Unlike the grand-scale film biographies of world leaders like Patton or Gandhi, 'Milk' honors its modest yet heroic subject with an intimate bio-pic that does not overwhelm its core performance. Like a fine red wine, 'Milk' has aged well, and, five years after its release, the film resonates even more as the march towards marriage equality progresses. Without heroes like Harvey Milk, the country would be a poorer place, and, thanks to Van Sant, Black, and Penn, his story and sacrifice continue to inspire.",10,0,2,8 August 2013
Pan's Labyrinth," Fairy Stories are not Always for Children
","The Spanish-language film, 'Pan's Labyrinth,' has perhaps the most misleading trailer in recent memory. Scenes of a young girl, a faun, and tiny fairies suggest a film that might be appropriate for children. Wrong. This often-brutal tale that takes place in Spain during World War II contains graphic violence and enough horrors to induce nightmares in the young or even in adults sensitive to suggested torture. However, when taken as an adult fairy tale with political overtones, the film rates among the best of the past year.Like other films about children who try to escape from an unpleasant reality into a fantasy world, writer-director Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth' immerses a young girl in the loveless household of her mother's second husband, a cruel captain in Generalissimo Franco's army. While her mother fades away as a difficult pregnancy saps her strength and a cold marriage destroys her will, the young girl is convinced by a faun that she is a princess of the underworld and need only complete three tasks to return and reclaim her rightful role.The cast is superb. Young Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the dethroned princess, with skill beyond her years, and Maribel Verdu is excellent as Mercedes, a compassionate servant with a secret. However, the standout is Sergi Lopez, who imbues the monstrous Captain Vidal with a cold cruelty that is evident from his first scene when he meets Ofelia. The politics of the filmmakers are unmistakably anti-fascist, and Lopez portrays Vidal with relish as an amoral, emotionless monster, who will stop at nothing in his battle against those who oppose Franco. Add first-rate production values, a delicate score by Javier Navarrete, and a captivating script and this Spanish-Mexican co-production emerges as a vastly entertaining gem for adults.",10,4,9,24 January 2007
Capote," Mesmerizing Performance in Complex, Contradictory Film
","Like the non-fiction novel and the Richard Brooks film that was made from it, 'In Cold Blood,' 'Capote' focuses on and sympathizes with two killers at the expense of the four murdered members of the Clutter family. Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, 'Capote' does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes 'In Cold Blood.' His feelings for Perry Smith, the more 'sensitive' of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.Fortunately, Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. 'Capote' will send viewers back to their bookshelves to re-read the book and to their video libraries to re-view the 1967 film. Considering the time that Capote spent with the two convicted murderers, questions arise as to why the Richard Brooks film did not have Truman Capote as a character, but rather presented a bland, nameless investigative writer, who wanders through the proceedings without much purpose. The film is so good and so intriguing that questions such as that, and what happened to the writer that Capote lived with? and did Harper Lee write anything beyond 'To Kill a Mockingbird?' and did Capote's presence at the execution lead to his alcoholism, his lack of further writing, and eventually his death, and other questions will send viewers to Google as soon as they get home. 'Capote' is an outstanding film and possibly the first of the year to be assured of a place on the '10 Best' lists for 2005.",10,173,219,28 October 2005
American Psycho," Fascinating, Ambiguous Film Echoes Hitchcock and Lynch
","In a world where appearances are everything and a man's status is determined by the typography, watermark, and paper quality of his business cards, lurks an empty shell of man, who is either falling deeper into madness or satisfying his intense blood lust through a series of brutal murders. Such is the ambiguity of this fascinating film that it easily stands up to repeated viewing if only to explore what is real and what is illusion. Patrick Bateman, who is a distant relative of Norman Bates in more than name, is a loner surrounded by people with whom he never relates. Although he does not hide from the world like Norman did, Patrick's icy facade, which has been conditioned and pomaded into a mask of normality, shields him from the world as effectively as the remote motel hid Norman. With his mask in place, Patrick Bateman intermingles in a world of interchangeable people, who vie with each other for social position through table reservations at trendy restaurants, the quality of a hair cut, or the fabric of a custom-tailored suit. Money flows from toil-less occupations in a New York milieu, where, as Gordon Gecko in 'Wall Street' so aptly summed up, 'greed is good.' The Reagan era on steroids, although Bateman's peers comment negatively on the president as they watch him try to explain away the Iran-Contra scandal during a televised speech. The young men's remarks about lying are ironic, when their own lives of sham and deceit are considered.But, under the glistening surfaces, like the depths explored by David Lynch in 'Blue Velvet,' the being who is known as Patrick Bateman lives another life, possibly in his deteriorating mind or possibly in dark back alleys and designer apartments or possibly in both simultaneously. Simply put, Patrick does not like women, and he does not like rivals, and he is eager to dispense with both through his adept use of gleaming stainless-steel axes or state-of-the-art nail shooters. While Norman Bates had deep-seated problems with sex and evidently did not have physical relations with women, Patrick does have sex with women, who are often paid. Patrick's women become debased objects that he abuses, while he admires his own physique in the mirror. Even in the most intimate act of sex, Patrick does not relate with anyone other than himself. However, unlike Norman Bates, Patrick Bateman does not have a mother complex, in fact, he does not seem to have a mother or any family at all. He is a being with no past, no relationships, and no soul. The role is difficult, and Christian Bale as Bateman is outstanding. The perfection of his looks and physique make him physically ideal for the part. But his performance is more than surface sheen, and Bale disarms the viewer as he slowly escalates from a cool emotionless young professional into a psychotic as the character descends further into his own perverted delusions or manic blood lust. Bale's is a performance as ambiguous as the film.The direction by Mary Harron is excellent as well. Harron wisely focuses on the satire inherent in the screenplay and downplays the violence, which is more often suggested than illustrated. Apparently, she has studied Hitchcock and knows that what the audience imagines can be far more powerful than what they actually see. 'American Psycho' is a stimulating work that can provide fuel for heated discussion about what actually does or does not occur. Does the violence exist only in the pornographically violent doodles in Patrick's office agenda or did an unseen protector clean up the evidence of his series of murders? Or both? Like Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' the film swirls downward like dark water into a drain as Bateman is sucked further into madness, which eventually consumes his entire world and draws the viewer in with him.",9,2,3,26 September 2005
Little Miss Sunshine," Let the Sunshine In on a Dismal Movie Season
","A dysfunctional family in a dysfunctional vehicle en route to a dysfunctional event makes for a fine comedy, thanks to a good script and a gifted cast. Take a failed inspirational speaker who spouts the wisdom of his nine points to success, a young man who has taken a vow of silence until he gets into the Air Force Academy, a gay professor who has just blown a suicide attempt, an old man who is into snorting cocaine and reading porn and throw them together in an old mini-van with a broken clutch and you have 'Little Miss Sunshine.' The film's title refers to a pre-teen beauty pageant in which the only seemingly normal member of the family, young Olive, has been entered.A road movie at its core, 'Little Miss Sunshine' offers enough laughs to coast through the few slow parts. Unfortunately, with the resurfacing of the Jon Benet Ramsey murder case, the scenes at the beauty pageant have an unsavory aspect as the young girls cavort in grown-up outfits and pose provocatively for the audience. For this viewer, young Olive, refreshingly dressed as a little girl, outshines the other overly made-up and overly rehearsed contestants. Greg Kinnear is fine as the father, although his drop-dead-handsome looks are at odds with those of the rest of his screen family. Toni Collette as Kinnear's wife is always good, and Steve Carell leaves 'The Office' behind and gives an underplayed performance as the gay uncle. Alan Arkin makes a welcome return to the screen as Kinnear's father, who offers his own advice on life, which largely centers on drugs and sex.Not since 'Happy, Texas' a few years back has a small, low-budget comedy come out of nowhere to brighten an otherwise dull movie season. With snakes, super heroes, and gross-out comedies filling the screens, discerning viewers can find relief and some intelligence in 'Little Miss Sunshine.' Two hours with this odd ball family as they lurch towards California is time well spent. Despite deep-seated differences and outward disdain, these six people show that family ties are deep and pull members together in times of crisis.",9,3,8,18 August 2006
The Patriot," Braveheart fights the British again
","Entertaining movie, but hardly original.  Mel Gibson is, well, Mel Gibson, which is both a plus and a minus.  Technically fine, but basically the film is full of 20th and 21st Century sensibilities.  It is not rooted in the 18th century, where an historical epic should be.  It takes more than costumes and sets to recreate an era and the film fails most notably on this point.  The characters are contemporary creations in costume.  And those evil British, like Nazis in redcoats.  Hope Tony Blair doesn't see how Americans depict the British when he's flying over the Atlantic to see Mr. Bush.",6,1,2,3 February 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," A Visual Feast Even if the Stars are a Little Dim
","When MGM invented the all-star movie with 'Grand Hotel' and 'Dinner at Eight,' the studio packed the casts with their biggest stars of the time: Garbo, Crawford, Harlow, Barrymore, Beery, Dressler. 'Star' is now a much abused, much diminished term, and Wes Anderson's all-star 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' features stars of varying wattage. As stars, perhaps Jude Law and Ralph Fiennes come closest, although the large cast also boasts nearly-forgotten Oscar winners: F. Murray Abraham, Tilda Swinton, and Adrien Brody; one-time A-listers: Bill Murray; and capable actors who never rose above support: Willen Dafoe, Harvey Keitel, and Jeff Goldblum. Nevertheless, the familiar faces are fun to spot and help keep characters straight during the ensuing chaos. Most important, the stars, former stars, and never-were stars seem to be having fun.A stylish, self-consciously old fashioned film, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' unfolds in flashback as F. Murray Abraham tells the story over dinner with Jude Law. The complex tale involves Ralph Fiennes, who managed the hotel during its hey day, and his protégé, a new lobby boy. Fiennes preys on rich, blonde, older women, one of whom dies; the ensuing madness involves a stolen painting and the second copy of a second will, a prison break and a bob sled chase, a young romance, a murder, a shoot out; the movie has it all.The real stars of the film, however, are the superb production by Adam Stockhausen costume design by Milena Canonero, retro-stop-motion effects, and eye-popping cinematography by Robert D.Yeoman. The film is presented in widescreen during the contemporary scenes, but switches to the nearly square aspect ratio of the 1920's and 30's when the action flashes back in time. The camera shots are often straight on and perfectly symmetrical, although sometimes shot Busby Berkley-style, straight down from overhead and, again, perfectly symmetrical. Camera movements mimic Kubrick and either push forward or glide sideways parallel to the frame. The stop-motion effects recall Melies and the earliest days of cinema in their flat simplistic style, and the obviously fake backdrops of Ruritanian scenery could have been done for an early-1930's Hitchcock. While not a direct copy or parody of old movies, 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an affectionate homage to a bygone era of film-making.While the all-star cast is as bright as stars get these days, directorial and designer style is the true super-star of Wes Anderson's film. The action is visual, the acting is broad, the plot is full of holes, but the cast, director, and crew evidently had great fun assembling the parts into a vastly enjoyable whole. The film is a big colorful bon bon, a fluffy cotton candy confection that leaves little behind except a pleasantly sweet aftertaste. Similar to 'The Artist,' 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' evokes the Golden Age of Hollywood; it's the kind of movie that audiences say they don't make anymore, but occasionally do.",9,2,10,23 March 2014
The Longest Day," One of the Last Films to Celebrate the Heroics of Battle
","Unlike subsequent films that depicted war as hell, Darryl Zanuck's spectacular epic 'The Longest Day' emphasizes the courage, heroism, and raw guts required to wage battle. Admittedly made about the last non-controversial war in which the United States was involved, Zanuck's film downplays the brutal realism of more recent war movies and focuses on the broad vistas of thousands of soldiers storming the Normandy Beaches on June 6, 1944. Employing dozens of well-known actors in small parts, 'The Longest Day' effectively utilizes the cameo approach to help viewers keep track of characters in the complex cutting between scenes that depict American, British, and German military personnel both on and off the battlefield. While a cast of unknowns would have enhanced the otherwise documentary-style approach, the audience would have been lost as to who was who. Among the large cast, John Wayne and Robert Mitchum, no strangers to war film heroics, register strongest, although Richard Burton, Sean Connery, Edmund O'Brien, Jeffrey Hunter, and Richard Beymer are also memorable. The bevy of rock and roll stars that includes Fabian and Paul Anka will be unrecognizable to younger viewers and illustrates the dangers of casting those with fleeting fame in a movie intended to be seen over the decades. Only one actress, Irina Demick, appears among the otherwise entirely male cast. Her credibility, however, as a French resistance fighter is severely undercut by her carefully applied makeup and perfectly coiffed hair.The stunning black and white cinematography creates bold and beautiful images of the battle, which was filmed on the beaches where it took place. One incredible uncut helicopter shot follows a platoon down the streets of a French town, around the harbor, and into an encounter with another platoon on the other side of the town. The logistics of setting up the shot must have been awesome in the days before CGI. Although three directors were used, evidently producer Zanuck was the guiding force, and the result is a seamless film with few blunders. Unfortunately, the screenplay at times relies on expository dialog to identify characters or to set up a scene, and occasionally an obvious attempt at 'meaning' creeps into such lines as 'I wonder who won?' The stirring march penned by Paul Anka may be too up-tempo and enthusiastic to underscore the depiction of a day when thousands died, but the music does emphasize the producer's intent to celebrate a great victory. However, the addition of insipid lyrics over the closing credits goes too far in trivializing a weighty subject. Nevertheless, 'The Longest Day' remains a fine tribute to the men who fought on D-Day and does a credible job of remaining faithful to the facts without embellishing them with the kind of fanciful fiction that marred another filmed depiction of the battle.",9,1,4,15 April 2007
Lincoln," Stunning Production & Faultless Performances in Long Slow Wordy Film
","The makeup and period hairstyles, mustaches, and beards on the countless male actors in Steven Spielberg's two-and-a-half hour 'Lincoln' are so meticulous that the characters seem to step from 19th-century daguerreotypes. However, what is high praise for the legions of hairdressers and makeup artists that labored on the film, the comment underscores a wandering interest from the slow, often ponderous proceedings on screen. The film's technical aspects are beyond reproach; from Janusz Kaminiski's atmospheric cinematography that evokes the gaslight era to Rick Carter's detailed production design of Civil War Washington, 'Lincoln' has been crafted with care and skill.The large cast of veteran actors equals the film's physical accomplishments. Led and perhaps inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, who inhabits the role of Lincoln as no one has done before, the performers are credible and often outstanding. Not since 'Forrest Gump' has Sally Field had a role like Mary Lincoln; although excellent throughout, Field has one spectacular scene that could clinch her a third Oscar and further proof 'that we really like her.' Playing congressmen, politicians, cabinet members, and generals, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Haley, Tim Blake Nelson and others ably fill the outstanding cast. Strangely though for a film about emancipation, few African-Americans have important roles.However, despite superb technical credits and an inspired cast that boasts Oscar-worthy performances, 'Lincoln' plods on with words, words, words, and little action beyond afternoon sunlight filtering through lace curtains. While the film recovers afterward, an opening scene that features soldiers reciting the Gettysburg Address to Lincoln is corny and unconvincing, and a number of scenes have 'important' rubber-stamped all over them. Perhaps die-hard Civil War buffs will relish the verbal sparring, but a lame attempt to create suspense during voting on the 13th amendment fails, largely because the outcome was revealed in elementary school American History texts. However, Spielberg often creates memorable images: Grant tipping his hat to Lee at the Appomattox surrender, amputated limbs tossed into a muddy pit, a clean new Stars and Stripes passing a soiled tattered Stars and Bars that flutters over a quiet battlefield littered with thousands of dead soldiers. 'Lincoln' is a film of countless elegiac moments, faultless technical credits, and award-worthy performances; unfortunately, an old adage applies, and the whole is less than the sum of its parts.",7,25,54,20 November 2012
The Dark Knight," A Super Hero for Adults and Kids Alike
","Finally, a super-hero film for adults. Avoiding the cartoon-style exploits of such super-heroes as Superman and Spiderman, director Christopher Nolan has fashioned a sophisticated, but hugely entertaining, take on the equally impressive Batman. 'The Dark Knight' is witty, intelligent, and fast paced. The action scenes and effects are spectacular, but do not dominate or overwhelm the film. Nolan does not linger over gratuitous explosions and lengthy chases. When a scene has communicated its purpose, he wisely moves on. Despite the film's 2½ hour running time, the movie seems tight and has little excess.Although Batman has no Robin, he is surrounded by a fine group of villains and supporters. Michael Caine underplays the quasi-butler, but delivers some amusing lines, and Morgan Freeman is solid and reassuring as another of Bruce Wayne's employees. Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman ably hold up the public servant side of the equation, and Maggie Gyllenhaal is fine as Rachel Dawes, although few demands were made on her talents. In the central role, Christian Bale is a fine Bruce Wayne/Batman. His icy-perfect face and pumped-up body are physically all that a Batman should be. Yet beneath the glossy exterior, he manages to breathe life into the crusading vigilante. Then, of course, there is the late Heath Ledger as the Joker. Ledger's performance steals every scene that he is in. Behind a crude childish makeup, he is at once demented, evil, funny, and over-the-top entertaining. However, even when he is delivering a humorous line, the villainous edge remains. When Ledger flicks his tongue, plays with his hands, or rolls his eyes, he captures the audience and holds them with his magic.Future super-hero films undoubtedly will be measured against 'The Dark Knight.' From Batman's stylish costume, his motorcycle, and the Batmobile to the dark, glistening cinematography, the stylish art direction, and the state-of-the-art special effects, the film rarely falters. With a sterling cast and a gifted director, 'The Dark Knight' sets a new standard for summer action flicks. At last, a comic-book super-hero film that will not only grab the key pre-teen male audience, but also bring in discerning adults who may never have read a comic book or attended a movie in the summer. Way to go, Batman.",10,17,36,18 July 2008
Into the Wild," A Selfish Quest for Truth
","Sean Penn's film 'Into the Wild' was based on true events and will haunt viewers long after the final credits fade to black. A recent college graduate, disillusioned by his parents' materialism and duplicity, Christopher McCandless heads off on a meandering journey with the goal of eventually reaching Alaska. Once he has 'disappeared' by abandoning his car, burning his money, and erasing his identity, the young man wanders the American west in search of himself. The ensuing road movie details the various encounters that he has over the months and years of his journey of discovery. Although Christopher has lost faith in human relationships, he meets and seemingly bonds with a number of people, all of whom take to the engaging, often charming, young man and try to help him. However, he unsentimentally severs his bonds with each, although they apparently have developed feelings and care for him. Rejecting friendship, Christopher seemingly has no romantic feelings or sexual desires either, and he rejects the one overture that is explicitly made.McCandless's wanderings eventually take him to the Alaskan wilderness where he takes shelter in an abandoned bus and manages to survive on fish and game. The film flashes back and forth between his time in the bus and earlier episodes. The words of his diary are quoted throughout the film, and his eventual realization that there is little joy in life without sharing it with someone comes too late. Emile Hirsch fills the physically demanding role of Christopher and plays it exceptionally well. Among the people Christopher encounters, Catherine Keener and Hal Holbrook stand out as a mature earth mother and a lonely widower, respectively.'Into the Wild' was made with the cooperation of the McCandless family, who were brave to have exposed themselves and their feelings so publicly. Well played by William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden, the parents emerge as typical appearance-obsessed Americans who cannot understand their son and mourn and grieve at his alienation and absence. They are not villains, and the son's actions wreak more pain on his family than they ever deserved or inflicted on him. In fact, the young man leaves much pain behind him in his ultimately selfish journey. Not only do his parents and sister suffer, but a young girl, an old retired widower, and a generous middle-aged hippie couple all fall victim to his charms and eventual abandonment. Although Christopher seems convinced that he is on a noble quest, there is nothing noble about inflicting unwarranted pain on those who love you. The words of his final realization and the images that end the film will be etched indelibly in viewers' minds. With both the screenplay and direction to his credit, Sean Penn has fashioned an outstanding adaptation of Jon Krakauer's book and has moved beyond 'promising' to 'accomplished' status in both roles.",9,3,7,12 November 2007
The Da Vinci Code," Fine Adaptation of Dan Brown's Intellectual Thriller
","There must be a vast clerical conspiracy to use film critics to convince the movie-going public that 'The Da Vinci Code' is a dull, inept, and plodding film, because Ron Howard's adaptation of the best-selling Dan Brown novel is anything but. Although the movie is far from a masterpiece, it does engage the thinking viewer and holds attention for its two-and-a-half hour running time. Like the film version of 'Gone with the Wind,' Akiva Goldsman's script feels like the entire book has been covered, even though logic tells you that much has been omitted from the long, detailed work. Unfortunately, the script apparently has been softened by political correctness throughout, and several instances of 'but that's only a theory' pass between characters that must have forgotten that few Biblical events have ever been proved with incontrovertible historic evidence. However, unlike Oliver Stone's 'JFK,' 'The Da Vinci Code' does not blur the line between history and fiction and, thereby, confuse less-informed viewers. Anyone with the intellectual curiosity to pursue the subject will be more confused by a reading of 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail,' the book that inspired the novel, than by a viewing of this relatively safe film.For avid readers of the Brown novel, Paul Bettany perfectly embodies Silas, the albino monk. Bettany captures what could have been a cardboard villain and imbues him with the glow of a true zealot whose trust has been used for evil. Ian McKellen shares top acting honors with Bettany, and, with devilish charm, he effectively carries the heavy burden of expounding the theories and history that surround the Holy Grail. Grainy footage is often used to add visuals to McKellen's historic details about the Knights Templar and to some of the characters' relevant memories. Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is effective, if not dynamic. His oft-criticized long hair works in the context of the film, and the English of his partner in the search for the Grail, Audrey Tautou, is easily understood. Her accent is nowhere near as thick as critics have declared. Readers of the novel will enjoy the scenes that were shot on location in London's Temple Church, the Louvre Museum, the Rosslyn Chapel, and other sites that are now famous from the book. However, somewhat disappointing is the elimination of any mention of the 19th-century priest in Southern France who gained great power and wealth from something that he found while renovating his old church.While 'The Da Vinci Code' does move slowly, the script has much information to impart, and the film could be termed an intellectual thriller, because the excitement is found more in the pursuit of clues, ideas, and truths than in chases. However, while Hanks and Tautoo have several tense moments, and Bettany provides a few bloody scenes, the movie is not for the action crowd. Unlike 'The Last Temptation of Christ,' the film is not for religious people who want to explore spiritual issues. Instead, Howard has crafted an intelligent thriller for inquiring minds who are not afraid to ask questions. As a fan of Brown's book, I was not disappointed in this wide-screen illustration of the novel, which may send me back for a second reading. The extent of the conspiracy to degrade the film has even extended to revisionist carping about the quality of the novel, which was generally received as an exciting read. Could countless millions of readers have been wrong? Hardly, and countless millions of viewers of the film will likely enjoy Ron Howard's fine adaptation and later relish some lively conversation.",9,0,3,19 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Frothy Action Comedy for Brangelina Fans
","Most two-career marriages have their share of problems, but John and Jane Smith have a unique set. Seated before an unseen marriage counselor at the film's opening, John and Jane appear relatively normal, although for two young attractive people, their sex life is non-existent, and they seem somewhat cool and distant. Can this marriage be saved? At their lavish home, Jane fusses about the new green drapes, John hates the color green; despite his aversion, Jane serves him green beans and peas. An evening out at a party emphasizes that the misfit couple is equally ill at ease among their neighbors; despite lengthy protests, Jane takes a baby onto her lap, and each looks at the other like an alien close encounter.The Smith's underlying problems surface when a seemingly inebriated John breaks into a poker game, and, separately, a leather-clad Jane strides into a hotel room and whips a kneeling handcuffed masochist. Unbeknownst to each other, the two married professionals are both highly successful dispatchers of unwanted people; a hit man and a hit woman. Famous as the film that spawned wall-to-wall Brangelina tabloid reporting, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' stars Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, as though anyone within range of the Internet or cable news is not already well aware.The film starts off well and, for at least the first half hour, is breezy amusing entertainment. Pitt especially seems to be enjoying himself; perhaps Angelina had already bewitched him. Unfortunately, the plot thickens and becomes confusing, violent action overwhelms the personal chemistry, and gimmicky gadgets stretch credibility. The film goes on far too long, and the joke eventually wears thin. However, Doug Liman's direction keeps the pace brisk, and the two leads play well together, although nothing on screen is remotely believable, and the story is already familiar from other movies. For most viewers, 'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' will provide frothy fun that will evaporate like soap suds before the credits roll. However, for die-hard Brangelina fans, this, their first co-starring epic, the movie that started it all, is a must-see.",7,1,2,10 January 2015
The Mission," Morricone Makes a Good Film into a Seemingly Great One
","Producer David Puttnam evidently has a gift for selecting composers that can lift good films to the status of seemingly great ones. In 1981, Puttnam hired the Greek composer Vangelis to write the score for a low budget film about two obscure athletes who competed in the 1924 Olympic Games. The resulting score, which was the most memorable attribute of the film, catapulted 'Chariots of Fire' to a Best Picture Academy Award. A half-dozen years later, Puttnam selected the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone to pen the score for a high-minded film about the Church-sanctioned abuses of indigenous people in 18th-century South America. The result was a magnificent musical work that not only enhanced 'The Mission,' but remains as one of the finest scores ever written for a motion picture. However, like 'Chariots of Fire,' Roland Joffe's 'The Mission' without its music would be less impressive.While Chris Menges's beautiful cinematography of Iguazu Falls and the South American jungles makes every frame suitable for a National Geographic centerfold, the tale of two men with conflicting moral centers often plods under the weight of its importance, which is written with a capital 'I.' Although Robert Bolt wrote the script with obvious conviction and feeling for the injustices doled out by the Spanish and Portuguese conquerors, good intentions do not always hold the audience's attention. The man of flesh, who is intensely played by Robert De Niro, struggles with his conversion from bloody soldier to submissive Jesuit. Meanwhile, the man of spirit, equally well delineated by Jeremy Irons, ponders the hypocrisy of his Church, which seems to put politics and greed above spirituality and souls. Unfortunately, when Morricone's soaring music is not swelling through the speakers, inner struggles with guilt, penance, and the meaning of life do not make compelling cinema.However, patient viewers who can immerse themselves in the music and the painterly images on screen may find 'The Mission' a moving experience that will leave them angry with the fate of the indigenous peoples who still struggle to hold onto their culture. One character rhetorically asks if these people would not have preferred that the Europeans had never arrived. Although 'The Mission' is less than the sum of its parts, the film is nevertheless worth seeing for its fine performances, stunning photography, and, above all, unrivaled music.",9,1,3,17 February 2007
1408," Effective Ghost Story
","Just when you thought it was safe to check into a New York City hotel, along comes Mikael Hafstrom's chilling '1408.' Not since Norman Bates terrorized guests at his motel has a paying customer received such treatment during a night's lodging. Although somewhat more cerebral than viscerally frightening, '1408' delivers its share of shocks and frights, and viewers will stay in their seats not to miss the film's twists and swerves. In a cruel blow to fans of 1970's soft rock, listening to the Carpenters' hit 'We've Only Just Begun' afterward may stimulate nightmares and certainly will never be the same again.John Cusack, a cynical writer who has sunk from producing intimate novels to hack work about haunted inns, is lured to a Manhattan hotel where room 1408 is off limits to visitors, because of its long history of inhospitality. With only a knapsack, but tons of baggage from family misfortunes, Cusack insists on a night in room 1408, despite the management's objections. Cusack triumphs over the staff and settles into the chamber's banal decor, which he idly describes piece by piece into his pocket recorder for the intended article. The evening starts to look like a genuine snooze, when the room's unsettling turn-down service, a chorus from the Carpenters, and a radio that begins an ominous countdown unnerve both Cusack and viewers.Although the 'night in a haunted house' routine has been done endlessly since movies began, Hafstrom for the most part effectively plays his audience with an eerie, often jarring, soundtrack, clever cutting, and a minimum of effects. '1408' is a ghost story, not a horror or slasher flick, and, as effective haunting tales have shown ('The Haunting,' 'The Uninvited'), the unknown, the unseen, and the unexplained are far more frightening than CGI effects. Although reminiscent of 'The Shining,' another Stephen King adaptation, this film was evidently made on a modest budget. Thus, Hafstrom worked largely with a one hotel-suite set and one mid-level actor. Besides Cusack, Samuel L. Jackson also appears as the enigmatic hotel manager, who warns Cusack about the room, yet seems to know more that he shares. Cusack is fine as always and carries the film effortlessly and literally through Hell and high water. While perhaps not as scary as the premise suggests, '1408' nevertheless provides intelligent entertainment for lovers of old fashioned ghost stories.",8,262,330,22 June 2007
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Abrams Delivers a Satisfying Sequel
","After his successful reboot of the 'Star Trek' franchise, director-writer J. J. Abrams and co-writer Lawrence Kasdan have turned to the 'Star Wars' series with equal or arguably better results. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' successfully mixes the old and familiar with the new and promising. Fans of the original trilogy will be pleased that the old includes Han Solo, Chewbaca, the now-General Leia, R2D2, and C3PO. Those seeking reassurance about the quality of future sequels will find promise in Daisy Ridley as the kick-ass Rey, who slides easily into the pilot's seat aboard the Millennium Falcon; in Adam Driver as Kylo Ren, the son of Han Solo and Leia, who has turned to the Dark Side; and Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, a dashing fighter pilot. The newly minted trio of Rey, Kylo, and Poe are worthy successors to Luke, Han, and Leia of the original films and should hopefully endure through at least two more sequels.Beyond the three leads, where Abrams could have stumbled, the film is technology based and cutting edge as such. A veteran of 'Star Trek,' Abrams stages the bountiful action sequences well; space and land battles, light saber fencing, and breathless chases across alien landscapes will keep audiences rapt with just enough dialog thrown in to keep viewers informed about the search for the missing Luke Skywalker, who is the last Jedi, and about the rise of a new threat to the galaxy. The film ends with a satisfying symbolic gesture between the new rising order and the old fading one that promises more to come. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' offers little to criticize. The special effects are state of the art; the mix of nostalgia for the Lucas productions and solid introductions that point towards the Abrams future is just right; the action is fast and exciting; the film delivers on its promise, was worth the wait, and injects new life into the franchise by harking back to the original films in both theme and character to produce a sequel that stands honorably beside them.",10,6,33,19 December 2015
RED," AARP vs the CIA
","Despite an obscure acronym for its title, 'Red' is a wildly entertaining live-action cartoon. Logic and reality vanish early on, and the audience embarks on an imaginative ride through CIA-conspiracy-paranoia territory. The CIA is assassinating a list of operatives from a covert operation in Guatemala. Retired agent, Bruce Willis, is awakened from a dreary life of chatting about lost checks with a Social Security administrator, Mary-Louise Parker, and solicits aid to solve the murders from several equally retired former compatriots. The geezer quotient in 'Red' is extremely high, and AARP could use the film to promote how exciting life can be after retirement. Led by 55-year-old Bruce Willis, the rough retirees include 73-year-old Morgan Freeman, 56-year-old John Malkovich, 64-year-old Brian Cox, and 65-year-old Helen Mirren. Not content with this stellar cornucopia of seasoned performers, director Robert Schwentke enlists 63-year-old Richard Dreyfuss and 93-year-old Ernest Borgnine, who looks thirty years younger, in supporting roles. With four Oscars and decades of experience between them, the cast is expectedly superior to the material.However, the engaging plot, based on a graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner, is often amusing and moves at a breakneck speed that shatters stereotypes of senior citizens. Thirty-eight-year-old Karl Urban, who plays Willis's adversary, CIA agent William Cooper, comes up bloodied and winded against his elders. The film appears to have been shot all over the U.S., and the clever use of postcard inserts keeps the audience aware of the settings, even if the scene changes occasionally confuse the players. 'Red' benefits most from its exceptional cast. Willis plays Willis in his best 'Die Hard' mode; Malkovich plays Malkovich in his amusing wacko mode; and Mirren plays the proper English lady who serves tea, arranges flowers, and occasionally kills people. Like the audience, Parker is initially caught up unwillingly in the mayhem, but her lust for adventure takes hold and she begins to enjoy the ride. While perhaps not a classic, 'Red' is nonetheless a good action film that delivers, and a trove of outstanding actors that have aged like fine wine appear to be having a great time and supplementing their Social Security checks at the same time.",8,2,3,20 October 2010
Thirteen Days," Excellent Depiction of Cuban Missle Crisis
","In October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge of war over Soviet missile installations in Cuba. Based on President John F. Kennedy's tapes and a script by David Self, Roger Donaldson's outstanding film, 'Thirteen Days,' effectively recreates that tense Cold War period. Told from the perspective of JFK's White House, including the president; his brother Robert, the Attorney General; and the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell; the film is largely dialog driven. Evidently based on actual conversations, cabinet meetings, and confrontations between the administration and the military, the proceedings have the ring of truth. Kevin Costner, who also co-produced, heads the cast as O'Donnell; his effective low-key performance communicates the stress of his unique job situation and the toll it takes on his family and private life. In one particularly effective scene, Costner stands outside a church, where a line of parishioners are waiting for confession; a sign says that confession is available throughout the night, and, after a pause, Costner joins the line.Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp play John and Robert Kennedy, respectively; both actors bear a passing resemblance to the Kennedy brothers, and, with Boston accents, they quickly submerge themselves into their parts, and the leads are well supported by a cast of pros, who portray a who's who of Kennedy administration officials familiar to any Baby Boomer who lived through the Camelot era; among them, Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara, Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson, and Len Cariou as Dean Acheson are worth mentioning.Although the film's ending is already part of history, 'Thirteen Days' remains engrossing, often tense, suspenseful, and fast paced. An excellent score by Trevor Jones punctuates the action, and the footage shifts from color to black and white in a seemingly arbitrary manner; however, whatever the intention, the shifts neither add nor detract from the movie. Stock footage depicts civil defense preparations, and shots of nuclear explosions foretell what could occur if the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviets had failed. Donaldson avoids claustrophobia by cutting from the White House to action in the skies over Cuba and events at sea as the U.S. blockade of Cuba takes effect. An excellent film that is well made and well performed, 'Thirteen Days' is more than a history lesson; it is a warning as well. The film would make a good double bill with Costner's earlier Kennedy movie, 'JFK.'",9,2,3,14 December 2016
Windtalkers," Misplaced Focus Missed Opportunity
","During World War II, Navajos were recruited by the U.S. military to send and transmit messages in a code based on their complex language; the Japanese were never able to crack the code, and the tale of these Navajos and their contribution to winning the war in the Pacific would have made an engrossing film. John Woo's 'Windtalkers' starts promisingly with a young Navajo, Ben Yahzee, played by Adam Beach, bidding his family goodbye and boarding a bus to join the army. While the early days of Yahzee's indoctrination and training in the Navajo-based code are touched upon, the film soon veers away and follows Sergeant Joe Enders, played by Nicolas Cage, whose sometimes contrived story is more conventional and less interesting than that of the Navajo recruits. Cage is assigned to protect Beach and his knowledge of the code from capture by the Japanese; Beach is unaware that Cage has been instructed to kill him rather than let him fall into Japanese hands.'Windtalkers' does detail the prejudice and persecution endured by the Navajos from both other enlisted men and their superiors, although to say the Navajos resemble the Japanese is an implausible stretch. Beach and Roger Willie as Charlie Whitehorse are the only two Navajo characters with any screen time. While Beach is a Canadian Saulteaux and studied Navajo for the film, Willie is a Navajo of the Wateredge Clan. Although Cage gives a solid performance as Enders and is ably supported by Christian Slater, Mark Ruffalo, Noah Emmerich, and Peter Stornare, the excellently conceived and filmed battle scenes upstage the actors. Often gruesomely graphic, John Woo stages sweeping battlefield scenes that are exhilarating and spectacular. Planes swoop overhead, bombs detonate and send streamers of shrapnel into the air, flame throwers ignite tanks and soldiers alike, and the camera moves in to capture a human torch or a savage bayoneting in closeup. The action and lush green Hawaiian shooting locations are beautifully captured by Jeffrey L. Kimball's excellent cinematography, and a fine James Horner score further enhances the film.A solid cast, good production values, stunningly realistic battle scenes, 'Windtalkers' has a lot going for it, but ultimately the film missed an opportunity to recount a fascinating footnote to World War II history. The movie begins and ends amidst the majestic splendor of Monument Valley and does pay passing homage to the contribution of the Navajos to the war effort and final victory. However, the focus has been misplaced on a white solder rather than on the Navajos, which lessens the film's import. Instead of a classic retelling of a near-forgotten story, 'Windtalkers' is a well acted, but routine war movie with some spectacular battle scenes that come perilously close to overwhelming the personal stories.",7,1,2,19 December 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Maximum Max
","Wow! Non-stop action that starts, accelerates, and never stops. 'Mad Max, Fury Road' is not for the faint hearted or those looking for a cerebral film experience, but definitely for action seekers who still want a movie with intelligence and a sense of style. Although the fourth screen appearance of Mad Max and the first without Mel Gibson, director George Miller, who helmed all four Mad Max movies, ups the action quotient this time out. As before, the plot is irrelevant, but serves as a vehicle for violent chases and clashes between a savage group who hold survivors of an apocalypse hostage for water and a small band of women fleeing sexual enslavement. Escaping his own imprisonment, Max joins the women, headed by the one-armed Furiosa, in their flight to a green area, where Furiosa grew up.Tom Hardy is a solid Max and dispels any nostalgia for Gibson; tough, laconic, yet human, Hardy recreates Max in an updated image. Refreshing in an action movie, the plot revolves around women, and Imperator Furiosa is Max's equal, both physically and intellectually. With head shaved and her usually porcelain complexion soiled, Charlize Theron is captivating and mesmerizing as Furiosa, a leader in every respect; she holds the eye in every scene in which she appears. Furiosa is a dimensional action character with depth and a past. The vast supporting cast of colorful characters with shaved heads, powdered torsos, and deformed bodies are all professional to outstanding, with a special mention for Nicholas Hoult as Nux, whose loyalties shift over time.The music by Junkie XL is pulse-pounding, to use a clichéd term, and enhances and punctuates the action. John Seale's brilliant cinematography of Namibian deserts creates an otherworldly apocalyptic universe, and the use of 3D is arguably the most effective yet; not only do objects fly from the screen, but rifles aim into the audience, and armored vehicles sail overhead from behind. The kinetic editing by Margaret Sixel screams for an Oscar and creates a kaleidoscopic montage of images that is literally eye popping, to use another tired, but appropriate phrase. The art directors had a field day and also scream for Oscars; the vehicles are mobile sculptures assembled from old VW Beetles, rusted oil tankers, and vintage finned sedans; a heavy metal rocker perches in front of a fantasy truck, while enormous audio speakers blare the beats of a half dozen drummers riding in the back. Bandits strapped atop long flexible rods dangle over the fleeing vehicles to snatch the escaping women from the truck cabs. Skeletal beings with dark flapping cloaks walk across an eerie landscape on stilts. A dictatorial ruler flashes an evil grin with a leering mask of huge animal teeth. Skulls abound everywhere.'Mad Max, Fury Road' may have been conceived for action junkies, but the creative art direction, impressive special effects, stunning landscapes, a newly embodied Max, and, above all, a riveting turn by Charlize Theron as arguably the best female action character yet, broaden the film's appeal. Wow! The best of the Mad Max series. A movie to be seen in theaters, because it will never have the same impact on a small home screen. Highly recommended.",10,3,11,18 May 2015
Draft Day," Another Score for Costner in Sports Genre
","Avid NFL football fans will likely be familiar with the annual draft of college players, although even they may be surprised by the Oscar-like ceremony at Radio City Music Hall on 'Draft Day.' Non-fans may find this film difficult to follow at first; they may also find it hard to comprehend the importance attached to this day by both team managers and potential draftees, who dream of an NFL contract. However, after the initial confusion clears, patient non-fan viewers will be rewarded with a generally entertaining film; the wheeling and dealing over potential draftees and draft positions intensifies, the clock ticks down to the deadline for making a pick, and genuine suspense rises. Kevin Costner is no stranger to sports movies, and he plays Sonny Weaver, general manager of the Cleveland Browns, with expected ease in a solid performance. Unfortunately, the female roles are gratuitous in what is essentially a male-centric film. Jennifer Garner has little to do as Costner's associate and love interest; the couple show little chemistry, and their romantic problems and trysts in the supply room add little to the film. Rosanna Arquette has a fleeting and unnecessary appearance as Costner's ex-wife. While Ellen Burstyn is always welcome, her brief role as Costner's mother borders on annoying; she appears callous and oblivious to the pressures on Costner, and her urgency to spread the ashes of Costner's deceased father on a playing field, when an important deadline approaches for her son, seems insensitive. Frank Langella is also welcome in a small, but key role as the owner of the Cleveland Browns, and he too delivers professionally. Director Ivan Reitman keeps the story moving and builds tension towards the end as Costner weighs the pros and cons of two potential draftees, while the minutes tick down. However, Reitman liberally utilizes split screens, sliding scene shifts, and occasional sequences in which a character will pass from a half screen on the right, cross in front of another scene in the center, and enter the first scene again, which is now a half screen on the left; sounds confusing, and it is. With viewers focused on the process, rather than the action or dialog, these splashy graphics distract rather than enhance; however, when used to introduce a city, its local stadium, and the name of the NFL team, the effect works well. 'Draft Day' will likely appeal more to football fans, who understand and are excited by the back room drama behind NFL drafting. However, the film should also grip non-fan audiences after an initial catch-up learning the rationale, mechanics, and lingo of the draft process. Good Costner performance, and generally entertaining, if unexceptional, film.",7,0,0,30 January 2015
