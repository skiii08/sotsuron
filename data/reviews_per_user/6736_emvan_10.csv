Your Name.," Donnie Darko w/Boatloads of Sweetness Instead of Angst
","Oh, and gorgeously animated.I think that's a fair way to sum up this movie. It starts out as a fantasy and, as it reveals more puzzle pieces, you realize it's more science fiction. There are tightly plotted reasons for everything that's going on, all of which are revealed in good time.Like like all good puzzle movies, there's a thrill every time something is revealed that ties things together. It's complex enough that you want to see it again immediately, but no so complex that you have any doubt as to what basically happened.Like Donnie Darko, while it's busy scrambling your head and keeping you guessing, it is somehow managing to be deep, both emotionally and thematically (the latter drawing on Japanese culture and religion). Unlike Donnie Darko, it's never dark and disturbing in a creepy way, although there is plenty of danger and peril. Instead, it radiates sweetness and love, without ever becoming saccharine.Donnie Darko is one of my two or three favorite films of all time, so this is high praise. Of all the films I've seen since, nothing has come closer to matching its combination of thrilling revelations, emotional resonance, and thematic depth than Your Name.",10,8,12,12 April 2017
Minority Report," A Serious Candidate For the Best SF Movie Ever. Really.
","I'm going to have to see this a second time before I declare it to be better than 2001.  But I can't remember ever being so eager to go back and see a movie again.Why is this movie so great?  Because it accomplishes two different extraordinary things that, I believe, no other sf movie ever has -- things that were trademarks of Philip K. Dick.First, it is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, with action, suspense, and numerous unexpected plot turns -- but it is simultaneously hugely thought-provoking, the way only the most fully thought-out sf is.  Phil Dick's novels have the power to keep you turning pages obsessively while striking you as profoundly insightful.  This is the first movie I've ever seen that pulls off this trick.Second, it's the first movie ever to capture PKD's unique combination of horror and humor.  This is a future that makes you wince and grimly laugh, simultaneously.  And that tone is sustained throught the whole movie.Needless to say, it looks fabulous.  And there is even, as you would expect from Spielberg, some sentiment, but it is well-earned (primarily by Cruise, a hugely underrated actor) and had me choked up good.Then 10 star system just doesn't do justice to a movie this great.
MAJOR, MAJOR SPOILERS OF TWO OF THE MOVIE'S COOLEST BITS.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, STOP READING NOW!!!!
If Phil Dick could have seen the scene where Cruise chases his own eyeballs, or the scene where he esacpes pursuit by inadvertently having a brand-new Lexus assembled around him, he would have stood up and cheered.  Those are the sorts of amazingly ironic, deeply evocative images that populate his work.  I'm just flabbergasted that the writers were able to come up with a screenplay that's so faithful to his vision.",10,0,0,21 June 2002
Memento," Neurologically Accurate, Too!
","It amazes (and amuses) me that people with zero knowledge of neurobiology and psychology can deign to criticize the science of the movie.  Well, take it from someone who just took an advanced undergrad seminar in the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory at Harvard (and got an A, too) -- the science in the movie is stone-cold rock-solid.  I've just seen it a second time, and it struck me just how much Leonard emphasizes the role of what cognitive psychology calls 'procedural memory' (and which Leonard quite reasonably calls 'habit' or 'instinct') in explaining why he's as functional as he is.  Procedural memory is spared in even the worst cases of anterograde amnesia caused by medial temporal lobe (hippocampus, etc.) damage.  And there are cases of people with amnesia as bad as Leonard's who are not institutionalized, but who live at home with their spouses and a system of notes and reminders (emphasis on 'system').POSSIBLE SPOILER . . I also want to chime in on one of the plot points that is much debated.  Near the end of the movie, Teddy tells Leonard that he's lying to himself about something crucial (and, in fact, transferring the memory of what happened to him so that he remembers it happening to someone else.  You know what I'm talking about, right?)  Most people I've talked to regard the question of whether Teddy is lying about this as ambiguous. It's not.  Sure, people misremember things that are too painful to remember accurately, as Teddy claims Leonard has done.  But you have to remember first, before you can misremember.  Had this really happened to Leonard (as Teddy claims) and not someone else (as Leonard remembers), Leonard could have had no motive to transfer the memory -- he would have forgotten the whole incident fifteen minutes later.",10,0,2,18 July 2001
The Prestige," Once: Excellent. Twice: Masterpiece. Thrice: All-Time Classic
","It's quite possible that THE PRESTIGE improves more with repeated viewings than any other movie ever made. As you might have gathered already, there are revelations at the end that force you to reinterpret everything you've already seen. The second time through, it's a different movie. Now, this trick has been pulled off before (most famously by THE SIXTH SENSE), but what makes THE PRESTIGE unique is that our identification with the characters changes once we know what was really going on, and the movie, which on first viewing is flawed only by a slight coldness, becomes profoundly emotional.It's possible that Christopher Nolan (and his screen writing collaborator, brother Jonathan) will never top MEMENTO, because the concept of that movie is so original. But in every other way, THE PRESTIGE is a more accomplished film, and it's so good that it (and its predecessor) actually make an argument for Nolan being the best director since Kubrick. The screenplay takes a justly acclaimed World Fantasy Award-winning novel and, astonishingly, improves it greatly. The screen story seamlessly cuts between three separate time-lines (or four, if you consider the very beginning of the movie) so deftly that you may not even notice how ambitious such a structure is. Unlike MEMENTO, the structure doesn't call attention to itself, but like their earlier movie, it is integral to the story being told.This is (the first time through) a hugely entertaining movie which (on subsequent viewings) turns out to be a deep meditation on obsession, on illusion, on sacrifice, on the nature of art and its audience. It's the best single movie of the last five years (exempting THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and, along with DONNIE DARKO, the best science-fiction or science-fantasy movie since BLADE RUNNER (and maybe since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY).",10,2,3,24 November 2006
Once," Impossibly Wonderful: 18/10. Really!
","If this were just a movie about a gifted young musician getting his career started, with no deep feelings, no romance, it would rate 9/10 or 10/10. Every detail is nailed, nothing is clich√©d, and the music is extraordinary.If this were just a romantic drama / comedy without music, it would rate 9/10. It would make a terrific double bill with _Before Sunset_, in fact. Like that film, there's not much to the story, but it's substantial nonetheless (especially emotionally) and it plays out unpredictably and true to life rather than following movie formula.It is, however, both of these things simultaneously, the two aspects not just seamlessly integrated but, in fact, one and the same.It's really pretty miraculous: a movie that moved me to tears and made me dance in my seat. It may do the same for you!",10,13,16,2 June 2007
Dreamgirls," A Great Blockbuster Musical ... Except for the Music (Oops!)
","Let's start with what's good. First and foremost, the performances are terrific, especially those by Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy, both of whom deserve their likely Oscar noms for supporting roles. The first half of the story is way too predictable to be anything more than decent, but there are some nice turns (not quite twists) in the third act and it ends up quite satisfying as drama. And finally, of course, it looks great.So what's wrong? Three things, all having to do with the music. (Note: I've been a music critic for thirty-five years, far longer than I've been a film buff.) First, filmed musicals have essentially two choices. On one hand, they can show us a world where people sometimes break spontaneously into song and are accompanied by unseen musicians, and do so without explanation or apology. Or they can go post-modern on us and give us a rationale for this preposterous phenomenon, as was done so brilliantly in CHICAGO and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER's 'Once More With Feeling.' The riskiest thing you can do is hedge your bet midway. Which is exactly what DREAMGIRLS does. Because it's a musical about musicians, half the musical numbers are simply songs being performed by the characters. Others are old-fashioned now-I'm-going-to-sing-instead-of-talk numbers, and some are hybrids, songs performed by the characters with snippets of I'm-singing-not-talking inserted via montage. Now, director / screenwriter Bill Condon wrote CHICAGO, so I'm sure that this inconsistent approach was intentional and was an attempt to expand the vocabulary of filmed musicals. Some may find that it works. It didn't for me; I was frequently taken out of the story by it.Second, any movie about the making of music has the chance to delight us by faithfully capturing the music-making process, by letting us watch as music is created, learned, refined, perfected. We got some of that in RAY and WALK THE LINE (and any movie based, however loosely, on the story of the Supremes and Motown Records invites that comparison) and a ton of it in HUSTLE AND FLOW. Here? Nothing, nada, zilch. There's not one moment where you say, oh, wow, that's how musicians do it, that's where music comes from. In that regard, it might as well have been a movie about three young black woman insurance underwriters.Finally -- and I've saved the biggest for last -- the music itself is thuddingly mediocre, standard Broadway pap with a thick R&B veneer. And the arrangements and production are simply awful, bearing no relationship at all to the actual pop Motown style. The Supremes' songs had swing, they had subtlety, the vocals weren't overwhelmed at every turn by blaring horn fanfares. The overproduction here is relentless, reaching its zenith during Hudson's final number, where we continue to hear the soulless fifty-piece orchestra obliterate the nuances out of the song even as we're watching Hudson perform it in a nightclub backed by a small combo! I know a lot of people will love this movie despite the huge musical shortcomings. For them, I pose this question: how insanely great would this movie had been if all the songs were as great as 'Where Did Our Love Go,' 'Come See About Me,' 'Back in My Arms Again,' 'You Can't Hurry Love,' etc. etc., etc.? The gulf between the music we're hearing and the actual music of the era portrayed is immense and staggering.",4,4,11,26 December 2006
Independence Day," Mind-Numbing Stupidity
","Of course, it's hard to explain why this is one of the stupidest movies ever made, a non-stop cavalcade of egregious plot howlers, without spoiling some of the plot points.  (OK, here's one: if the aliens have multiple tentacles, why did they design spaceships that can be flown with two hands?)  Great sf has *never* been about turning off your brain and not questioning the patently ridiculous.  And everything that's stupid about this movie actually serves to make the story *less* interesting (e.g., instead of having to figure out how to fly the alien  spaceships, just turn the key and go!). This movie was a big success for three reasons: it rips off some classic images from written sf (such as the immense spaceships appearing over world cities, from Arthur C. Clarke's _Childhood's End_), it has great SFX, and the good guys win.  For  many, that was enough to  overcome the putrid screenwriting.  The  filmmakers were not so lucky with _Godzilla_ -- and if there's any justice in the world, they'll never be allowed near a camera again.",2,7,13,27 July 2000
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Peter Jackson Returns to Form!
","The second installment of Peter Jackson's Hobbit adaptation is an immense improvement on the first, which (especially in the Extended Edition) is an excellent film, but falls far short of the historic brilliance of his LOTR. The biggest challenge facing Jackson and his fellow screenwriters in the entire adaptation was turning Bard into a full character worthy of Tolkien, and they have done so spectacularly well. A less obvious challenge was the fleshing out of the Elven King Thranduil (Legolas' father), and that's superb, too. The invented character of Tauriel doesn't have nearly the depth of those two, but she serves her plot purpose very well and is a treat to watch.Unlike the first movie, which simplified and dumbed down the back-story of the Dwarf and Goblin / Orc War for no good reason, the changes to the story here are nearly all well thought-through, and some are so smart that Tolkien himself might have applauded (e.g., what they've done with the moon rune inscription). There's a sequence from the back-story that has been moved into the time frame of this film that's just stunning. The relentless pursuit by Orcs that I thought marred the first film (too much, too soon) here feels organic. The result of all these smart decisions is a film that, much more than Part 1, feels like part of the same Middle Earth epic as the classic LOTR.Needless to say, the film is a technical marvel (although I don't think the 3D adds much), featuring some of the best action sequences of any of the films, and -- are you surprised? -- Best. Dragon. Ever.",9,10,21,13 December 2013
Across the Universe," When It Works, It's Magical (And When it Doesn't, It's Still Cool)
","Across the Universe does several things gloriously. First and foremost, it tells an archetypal love story (that is, a love story that is intended to be familiar and universal, not novel and quirky) and makes it incredibly moving by doing it as a musical using many of the best Beatles songs (more about that later). It's visually stunning and features some of the most audacious, jaw-dropping choreography to come out of Hollywood in years. And it paints a very solid picture of the political unrest and psychedelic exploration that fueled the 60's.It's in the latter sequences where the movie sometimes misfires slightly. The straightforward Beatles love songs are almost always complete successes. The problem comes when the script tries to incorporate the tripper songs from their psychedelic period ('Strawberry Fields,' 'I am the Walrus,' 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite'). These lyrics aren't really about anything the way 'It Won't Be Long' or 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' are, and the scenes built around them (while wildly inventive and entertaining if regarded in isolation) come across as slightly forced and/or bring the plot to a halt.The music? I'm a former rock critic who owns nearly 2000 CDs, none by the Beatles. It's not that I don't think they're great, it's just that these songs have been so overplayed, I really feel no need to hear them again. The versions here are almost uniformly terrific and serve as incredible reminders of just how great these songs are. If you're someone of my generation who acknowledges that 'Hey Jude' is a brilliant song but is just plain bored by it after the 1000th listening, run to the theater, because hearing it here is like hearing it for the first time (maybe better, since it's embedded in a love story that, by this point in the film, has really grabbed you). And if you want to know whether a film critic can be trusted with movie music, see if they hated the music here but loved the music in 'Dreamgirls': if so, they're musically illiterate.8/10 (and I'm a tough grader: that means I loved it and endorse it without reservation).",7,2,6,17 October 2007
Cloud Atlas," Audiences 1, Critics 0: This is a Brilliant Masterpiece
","Thirty years ago I staggered out of a movie theater on the opening afternoon of a new movie that I thought had brilliantly pushed the boundaries of what film could do, only to discover over the next week or two that critics had largely hated it. That, of course, was Blade Runner. Time will prove the critics just as wrong about this one.As you no doubt know by now, this movie intercuts between six separate stories: three in the past, one in the present, two in the future. I don't know why anyone would find this confusing or hard to follow, though. All but one of the six stories is told strictly chronologically, and that one is still easy to follow because it begins with an interrogation and the rest of the story cuts between the interrogation and (the vast majority) the story being told to the interrogator.Each of the stories packs an amazing amount into 25-30 minutes. The actors do uniformly terrific jobs of quickly establishing an emotional connection, so there's someone to care about in each one. Almost all contain thrills and excitement. One is very funny, in a wonderfully character-driven way. Some elicit tears of grief, some tears of joy, and none of it too predictably.The switching between the stories is astonishingly effective; this is simply the best-edited movie I've ever seen. Even in the third act, when we're cutting between six different climaxes, there's not a moment where you feel taken out of the larger story by a less-than-perfect switch between two of the elements.There are devices knitting the stories together explicitly, most notably the casting of actors in multiple roles and a birthmark that multiple characters have. You actually don't need to follow any of that on the first viewing, though. And that's because the stories overlap thematically.STRUCTURE (not plot) SPOILERThe one thing I did get on the first viewing is that each story becomes a story in the next story chronologically. The protagonist of the 2nd story reads the published diary of the protagonist of the 1st. The 3rd story heroine comes into possession of and reads letters written by the 2nd story hero (which in fact tell the whole story). Her story is witnessed by a young boy who apparently grows up to be a thriller writer, and his novelization of those events is read by the protagonist of the 4th story, who is a publisher. He writes a memoir of his story, and it's turned into a film which is viewed by the characters in the 5th story. And the 5th story becomes very important in the 6th story in a way I won't divulge. (Furthermore, the sixth story is being told to others in a very brief framing story which doubles as the sixth story epilogue.)END SPOILERI'll be seeing this again in the theater and devouring the Blu-Ray when it's released. And right now my list-making brain is tentatively slotting it in as my 16th favorite movie of all time, after On the Waterfront, The Wizard of Oz and Dr. Strangelove, and ahead of Inception, Blade Runner, and The Seventh Seal. Yeah, it just may be that good.",10,17,32,26 October 2012
