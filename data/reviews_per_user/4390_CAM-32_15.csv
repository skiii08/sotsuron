The Rock," Yeah, doesn't he play for the f***ing Red Wings?
","The actions great, Cage is funny, Michael Biehn is great, but Bill Forsyth steals the whole movie in a five minute scene where he threatens Sean Connery, perfectly written and perfectly acted by Forsyth, HILARIOUS, what a hard-ass.  That was easily the best scene in an otherwise excellent movie. ***",Null,1,1,2 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A great movie in itself but...
","First of all, everyone just needs to calm down about Jar Jar, he was not that bad at all, I liked him a lot.  The action is great, especially the lightsaber fights and the acting is first rate, Liam Neeson Ewan Mcgreggor Natalie Portman and Darth Maul were all excellent.  All in all a most enjoyable movie.  I just have a hard time relating it to the original trilogy, its just different stylisticly (maybe they did that on purpose.) For example, can you imagine Alec Guinness's Obi Won from Star Wars referencing this movie?  'Hey Artoo, this irregularly shaped potato chip reminds me of this pink numnuts I knew named Jar Jar, we partook in adventures, had fun, got laid... it was cool.'  Doesn't sound right to me. The movies don't connect stylistically, BUT there are still two more movies to make the transition.  All in all, fine filmmaking, well worth the hype. ***1/2",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
Amistad," Very, Very Good
","*possible spoilers if your very pickyFirst of all, this is a great movie.  I believe it to be Spielberg's best, way better then his hugely over-rated movies like ET and Saving Private Ryan.A lot of people complain about this movie pretty much ending half way through, only to have the Africans put on trial again with the movie dragging its way to a second ending.  Hey, get real, complaining about that is pretty petty considering it was probably a little more annoying for the real men who had to be tried for their freedom twice then for you sitting on your ass.A more reasonable complaints would be that Morgan Freeman is wasted in a role that's a static copy of the roles he always plays.  Another problem is the once African taken into the British Navy who translates for them.  His style is way too nineties-cool-black-dude, the actor who plays him is not very good and clips of him whispering the captives victory chants and sailing back to Africa with them are unecessary and inaccurate respectively.That said, the good stuff totally out weighs the bad thanks in large part to Djimon Hounsou who is just really damn good.  You will be blown away, enough said.  Another guy worth watching is the British Naval Officer who is a dead-cool-hard-ass.  He's fun to watch and subtly let's you know that Britain really had a lot of the right ideas at that time, more forward then the US and the rest of Europe.  Anthony Hopkins is magical of course, you should expect nothing less from him.One more thing, watch for the scene where one of the Africans is describing what he has deciphered from pictures in the New Testament to Cinque... it is absolutely stunning.",Null,0,2,3 July 2000
The Natural," At times stunning, but it could use some editing
","This is a movie with a great story: an unknown aged ballplayer appears who has magical talent.  This concept leads to a couple of wonderful scenes. Most of all, the scene featuring Roy Hobbs first at bat as a Knight is spectacular.  I would be willing to say that every shot of this scene is perfect.  The growing storm that accompanies him, the foreshadowing, the music, the magic... it is the stuff of legend, again, fabulously done. Unfortunately this movie is too long and boring.  I very much enjoy a slow developing story, if every scene in this movie featured an amazing home run by Roy Hobbs, the power would be lost, thus its necessary to keep things slow.  However it is not necessary to tie in ridiculous side-stories, such as an evil owner trying to take an idiot manager's shares of the ball-club. Yeah!! Roy Hobbs fights corruption to save the dunce manager!!! How idiotic, how about just plain Roy Hobbs plays baseball because he loves baseball; that's what the movie's trying to say, why try to add more suspense? Cutting this kind of uselessness would really help this movie on a couple levels.  I'm very tolerant of slow movies and I love baseball, but this movie is boring.  Robert Redford is ok, some may disagree, but I think he comes off as too much of a prick in this movie, especially since it seems clear that from the script Roy Hobbs is a very good guy, yet somewhat mysterious.  I think Redford turns mysterious into prick.  The manager is annoying, Kim Bassinger is not that great, Glenn Close is good but not at all attractive, Michael Madsen was great and Robert Duvall is very good as well. ***",Null,0,1,21 January 2001
Gettysburg," A Fabulous Tribute
","Watch this movie and you will get a great four-hour lesson on America's most important event.  In part, Gettysburg teaches us the strategy and important events from the battle.  During or before the battle scenes we see the men in charge discuss the plan of attack so the viewer can learn a lot about the astounding achievements and blunders that occurred.  As an added bonus, between the battle scenes we watch the various characters discuss the moral and political issues of the war, and while this may or may not be completely realistic (it must have gone on to a certain extent) it serves as some great room for thought.  These conversations (particularly between Chamberlain and his sergeant) are quite graceful.   No opinions are forced, instead the expressions of the individuals serve as characterization and a chance to consider different viewpoints.  The music by Randy Edelman (Last of the Mohicans) is hugely effective, it complements every emotion perfectly.  The cast is just as brilliant.  Supporting actors C Thomas Howell (Tom Chamberlain), Stephen Lang (George Pickett), Brian Mallon (Hancock) and Kevin Connelly (Kilrain) all especially nailed their characters, but the clear standouts are Richard Jordan and especially Jeff Dainels who apparently geared up for Dumb and Dumber by playing Col. Joshua L. Chamberlain (the huge underdog hero) as well as any actor has ever performed.  Jordan, as Confederate Gen. Armstead, brings unparalleled emotion to his powerful, powerful death scene.  As it was, Jordan was aware that he himself was dying of brain cancer while the scene was filmed, the result is crushingly authentic.",Null,1,1,7 August 2000
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," They'll see the big board!
","Dr. Strangelove is truly a hilarious movie that also has a strong bite leaving you chuckling thinking of scenes like Sellers' turn as the title character and at the same time contemplating the most fearful issue in the history of the world.  Kubrick got a huge helping hand from his cast on this one, Sterling Hayden and Peter Sellers are marvelous and George C. Scott needs to be arrested.  The charge being larceny.  The man stole the show. Anyone who's seen Patton needs to see this so they can see what a gifted comedian George C. Scott actually is.  His performance is just incredible. This is a very original movie and it is one of the best comedies ever made. ****",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
He Got Game," Pretty lousy
","Overall this movie pretty much sucked, its kind of boring and contrary to what some people say, All-Star Ray Allen is a terrible actor and detracted a lot from the power of the movie, especially when he is paired with the awesome force of Denzel Washington.  On the plus side the boy who played young Jesus Shuttlesworth was very similar to Allen... also a terrible actor.  Denzel Washington is once again amazingly convincing in his role, this time as a mostly ignorant father with some intriguing wisdom who was sent to prison for accidentally killing his own wife (that scene is ridiculous, unless his wife had a completely separate unnoticed brain tumor that coincidentally hemorrhaged just as Denzel pushed her a whole two feet into the stove.)  Other pluses in the movie are an amazing scene involving an agent who talks a great game and Laker Rick Fox, a much more natural actor than Allen, who makes a cameo in an amusing scene as a black college baller who likes his chocolate white.  The scenes between Denzel Washington and Milla Jovovich are very nicely done (especially the work by Denzel) although it seems odd that a bum who killed his wife and a cheap tramp shacked up in a sleazy hotel would be two of the most attractive people on the planet.  Unfortunately the movie's handful of great scenes are buried by areas of ill-conceived situations and dialogue, blaring music that is poorly chosen and a vintage Spike-Lee-totally-wacked ending.",Null,4,6,1 April 2000
Garden State," Your basic movie trying hard to be original
","This movie is well-intentioned, but it ends up really falling in line with your basic movie... not necessarily a bad thing.One reason why I say this is that movie stands stalwart behind it's two main characters. During the course of the movie they are inspirational, whimsical and seemingly never wrong, yet somehow they have highly-checkered pasts. They also conveniently don't spend enough time together to get into the guts of what their relationship would be like... a sort of post-Sleepless-in-Seattle phenomenon that this movie does nothing to break away from.Of course there must be an enemy, in this case it is his father. I don't understand why he is made to play the villain. It is certainly not necessary. The character is designed to have excellent inner-conflict and motivation for his actions, he's also played by a fantastic actor, yet he is made to be a cold, plotting, one-dimensional villain from start to finish. A villain such that the movie can climax with him being put in his place by his son, as any cheap trick movie would.The movie is nice, but utterly fanciful in the same way as say, The Shawshank Redemption or Forest Gump, where it has a realistic plot, but unrealistic execution. This is not Mean Streets... not that a movie has to play it straight to ring true. An outside-the-box movie can have an unrealistic plot, but realistic execution. Take Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind; the plot is out there, but the movie is genuine. If you've seen both Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Garden State, think of the weight and depth of the central characters. In Garden State, the characters are fun and neat, but their depth is falsely created in a few sentences of plot-work that doesn't match what's on the screen. What's on the screen is NOT a study of an over-drugged boy (with a severely traumatizing incident) falling in love with a girl who has clinical mental issues. That topic is really left for documentary because how, as sane people, can we begin to structure the feelings behind such a plot? What's on the screen fits a couple normal slackers, there's nothing wrong with simply making them slackers and that's who these characters should be. Slackers can be clever and endearing like these characters, they don't have to be defined as insane and on drugs.Maybe I was in a grumpy mood... but what was with all those barely funny sight gags? These 2-3 second, no-dialogue shots of stuff like, all of them on the motorcycle, or all of them wearing the plastic bags for the rain etc. It looked like the stuff on sitcoms, I was wondering where the laugh-track was (cue laugh-track)",6,2,4,21 June 2005
For Love of the Game," God, this movie was bad
","This movie borrowed a lot from Major League.  Veteran guy's guy with diminishing skills has on and off relationship with bookwormish girl who used to be wild while an evil owner looks to replace the veteran, a one-dimensional upscale arty man appears in one scene looking to steal the girl and a boorish Yankee villain threatens the pitcher on the field.What it doesn't have that Major League had was a great supporting cast of characters, real dialogue, chemistry between the lovers, realistically crass on the field behavior (on the field scenes were so corny in For Love of the Game) a ton of great humor and just being an overall good movie.One more thing, maybe I missed something... but the Costner cutting his hand scene was one of the most laughably ridiculous scenes I've ever seen in a movie.  I once cut my hand with a chainsaw, wrapped a glove over it, got driven to the hospital, stood in the lobby waiting three hours because its obviously not at all life-threatening or critical, then got stitches and left.  Costner is cut on the pouch of skin between his thumb and finger by a table saw.  He then stammers back toward the house losing consciousness.  He is rushed to the Hospital where he appears delirious as Kelly Preston makes the most embarrassing rant I've ever scene in a movie because no one will help him.  He is then taken by helicopter somewhere else (no one in that hospital can stitch a cut?) and on top of all that he has oxygen tubes?  How ridiculous is that?  It was as if he'd been shot 3 times in every vital organ when instead he has a one inch cut on his hand.",Null,0,0,24 March 2001
Reservoir Dogs," An average movie from Quentin 'One hit wonder' Tarantino
","Pulp Fiction might be the best movie of the decade and Reservoir Dogs is not a bad movie, its just not very good.  Tarantino deserves all the praise in the world for Pulp Fiction, it was a great script, wonderful direction and he even managed to resurrect the dead (John Travolta.)  Reservoir Dogs struggles most of the way after a great first five minutes.  The movie's psychological tension falls well short of what it could be because it is quickly lost through thoughtless violence.  Violence can fit if its done well (Fargo, Godfather, Pulp Fiction) but this violence is totally pointless.  Useless and tasteless violence like this is only needed in a movie with no story, if the movie already has a story it turns the viewer away from an otherwise provocative story as was the case in Reservoir Dogs.  Tarantino seems to have the know-how to make an excellent movie, only he manages to blow it every time except for Pulp Fiction.  Reservoir Dogs is not without fine acting, at the forefront are Tim Roth and Chris Penn, Michael Madsen is excellent too, but Steve Buscemi is not on par with his performances in Desperado and Fargo and Harvey Keitel is just awful.  I can't stomach his waivering from trying to look cool and tough to whining and crying in vigalantic protection of Tim Roth and back an forth.  I suppose it could work, but not Keitel, wrong guy for the movie, he should stick to Sister Act.  Tarantino casts himself perfectly as Mr. Brown, he has a brief but very funny part both talking about Madonna and yelling 'I'm going blind!' his acting is not bad at all in this one.  All in all, Tarantino was close, but this movie ends up not being a lot of fun, not a lot of story nor a lot of thought, we'll only ever see those three from him once in this lifetime.  What has he been doing lately anyway? Maybe Travolta needs to return the favor and try to bring the spotlight back on Tarantino. **",Null,1,3,6 August 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Great Movie? nope, there's no truth to it
","Many, many people jock this movie, calling it an intelligent, philosophical and moving epic, but It's really not all that.  It is a good movie, but it is not great or thought provoking at all.  That year, 1994, was a great year for movies considering Pulp Fiction, Ed Wood and Quiz Show among others, yet people think Forrest Gump and Shawshank Redemption are great' movies?  Gag me.Here's some of the problems (Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie)Morgan Freeman's character - Don't get me wrong Freeman is a great actor (even if he always plays the same part) but seriously, did you ever watch MTV's Scared Straight' or listened to Chris Rock's stand-up?  Now tell me what kind of 18-year-old murderer goes to prison and kicks around using words that would make Edgar Allen Poe go get his copy of Webster's? Freeman's character's narration also served as a purpose to constantly bludgeon the viewer with 2nd rate philosophy people who've never been to prison come up with.  By the end I was literally exhausted from the constant stream of corny insight I've already heard.  Tell the truth now... If you saw a murderer on the evening news you'd probably want him dead or at least in prison for life, yet here you're supposed to rejoice in his parole as a result of a tired, bitch-em-out-I-don't-care speech that only seems to come up in movies.  Another detraction to the narration is Morgan Freeman dropping the F, it never sounds right.The Warden - How many absolutely despicable characters has that guy played? Has anyone that evil ever run a prison?  That is classic jail movie material.  Obviously the filmmakers realize people will be upset about glorifying criminals so the answer is to make the authority pure evil.  How irritating If you want to convey criminals, just show them having fun and being real people; don't try to cover it up with evil police, try Bonnie and Clyde or Pulp Fiction, much more interesting.Brooks  Some serious button pushing here.  Brooks is a typical, lame attempt to draw out some sentiment.  The bird thing is a rip off of Escape from Alcatraz and like Freeman's character he's a great guy who happened to commit an offense so despicable he's in one of the most secure prisons in the country, but we can forget about that, right?  The `Brooks was here' hanging himself because he can't keep up is another Hollywood favorite.  Who hangs themselves?  My gosh, at Nuremberg guys took poison to avoid being hanged because of the shame and disrespect.  Yet, Brooks hung himself when at his age he could have waited a week and let nature take its course.   Or better yet if Brooks got an old-fashioned whore and binged himself to death on alcohol and mind-altering drugs.   Almost sounds like fun, who would prefer hanging?  You know who, a character in a movie.  That pretty much sums up the Shawshank Redemption, for what its aiming for it misfires because there is nothing genuine or authentic about it.",Null,1,1,6 August 2000

The Silence of the Lambs," This movie is average
","The acting in this movie is excellent from Oscar winners Jodie Foster and Sir Tony as well as Scott Glenn who was great as the FBI guy and the no-name who played the psycho (excellent job portraying an EXTREMELY ILL character) but the movie is flawed.  In reality it won Best Picture because of a severe lack of good movies (seriously, if they decided to make Speed II or Muppets from Outer Space that year, the competition would have been tougher)  The movie's big mistake was totally selling out by having Hannibal Lector escape.  This draws the movie too far away from its central plot making the movie too much about him.  The way I see it, whoever wrote it at first intended Lector to be a deep psychological informant then decided he was too cool to keep under control then decided audiences would prefer him to get out so he damages the story to appease the masses in typical Hollywood fasion, when it would have been much better for him to be locked up the whole time.  Had they stuck to having him in the asylum the whole time, the movie would be a totally psychological thirller as opposed to a cheap 'whats the nutty douche going to do next now that he's escaped' thriller.

The Thin Red Line," A Masterpiece
","Full of rich imagery and detail, Terrance Malick's The Thin Red Line is one of the finest movies ever made.  The movie is gripping and poignant, anyone who says its boring and defends that by saying 'I got the point' is missing the point.  The Thin Red Line is not a lesson to learn, it is a moment to experience, offering the viewer a chance to make his or her own insight. Because of the subject matter and the time of the release, The Thin Red Line begs comparisons to Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, so I'll tell you, The Thin Red Line is far better then Saving Private Ryan.  The Thin Red Line derives its power from characters, not graphic violence.  Violence is cheap.  It seems that Steven Spielberg nailed every detail recreating the carnage of D-Day, that was his goal, the next step was to come up with a silly plot, then the step after that was to come up with a set of cliche laden characters to carry out the plot to show the violence.  Life-like characters and scenes take precedence to life-like violence in Malick's film. The acting is stellar, Woody Harleson, Nick Nolte, Sean Penn (perfect cast), Ben Chaplin, John Cusack, Elias Koteas as well as many of the Japanese actors are all outstanding.  The only one out of place is Sergeant McCron (horrible performance by John Savage) who is wildly over-the-top in a movie where everything is so beautifully understated.  Fortunately he is only in a couple minutes of the movie.  The stand-out is no-name James Caviezel who is stunningly brilliant as Kentuckian Private Witt, who speaks volumes with his face alone. This movie is very intelligent, more so than I can fully grasp, but don't watch it thinking that there is some hidden message you have to discover that most Hollywood movies would pummel you with using every cheap sentiment trick.  Simply involve yourself in this movie and soak up every image and emotion and when the final credits role and you listen to the Guadalcanal natives singing, you will have appreciated and enjoined a masterpiece.",Null,0,0,21 January 2000
