Howl's Moving Castle," In my opinion, Miyazaki's weakest film
","Now, don't kill me, please. Let me explain. This is still top quality. It features everything one comes to know and love from Hayao Miyazaki, but this one just doesn't do a whole lot for me. It didn't really touch me in ways that other Miyazaki films did, (The finale was good though).Oh, and I've noticed that this film is particularly popular with women. Well, I'm just gonna say it. I think it's because a lot of them find Howl attractive. I know that's a shallow thing to say, but I see this film get a lot of attention, when it's always seemed like a lesser film in Miyazaki's filmography. At least, to me it seemed that way.I know it seems like I really don't like this movie, but that isn't true. The characters all interact well, and I found the last act of the film to be really touching. It's still beautiful to look at, (particularly the 'walking on air' scene), and the voice actors all do well. I just think that, like'Spirited Away,' this one is just a tad overrated. Go see it and form your own opinion though.",10,0,2,22 July 2019
My Neighbor Totoro," A little film.
","And there's nothing wrong with that. After directing two epics in a row, Miyazaki went smaller for his fourth feature. I really respect that he scaled back his work for a time, letting some more 'out-there' ideas be produced, before returning to creating epics in 1997.A word of caution though. Don't go into this expecting too much to happen plot-wise. Not saying that you should have low expectations, or anything, but I could understand if the story of two young sisters, and their forest spirit-thing, doesn't hold your attention at first. Instead of looking for action, try to focus on the relationships and chemistry of all the characters. And also, just have fun! Let go! Let the film uplift you!Oh, and I mean it when I say it's uplifting. Every time it gets to the part where Satsuki finds her little sister, and they go to secretly visit their mother, I'm always grinning from ear to ear, (Like Totoro)! A nice, light Miyazaki film.",10,0,0,22 July 2019
Spirited Away," Miyazaki's Masterpiece!
","But not my favorite film of his. Not to say that it's a bad film! Not at all! It's beautiful, creative, and absolutely deserved that Oscar win! However, there are a few films of Miyazaki's that I just like more. Not many, this would probably be my fourth favorite film of his, but sometimes I feel a little too much praise is placed on it.Like I was saying though, the film is still classic Miyazaki, with stellar animation and acting. This one also has a little more, 'thinking material,' I guess you could say. His earlier films weren't devoid of that, but scenes like the one on the train can really give one a lot to analyze. So that's something different.Like I said above, not bad by ANY means, but maybe a tad bit overrated. Maybe.",10,0,0,22 July 2019
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Why I love Miyazaki!
","When I rewatched this film a few weeks ago, I remembered why I love Miyazaki's films so much. This beautifully animated epic, (and I do mean an epic, in every sense of the word), is probably my favorite of all of Miyazaki's films. And it isn't even a Studio Ghibli film, technically. It's stunning animation was by a studio called 'Topcraft,' and they really knocked it out of the park.I should also mention the brilliant voice acting by Sumi Shimamoto. She voices the titular Nausicaä, (Who's my favorite Ghibli Girl), and she really nails every single line. In my opinion, her perfromance in this film, and as Kyoko in the 'Maison Ikkoku' anime are her two greatest vocal performances.Oh, and this film has my favorite musical score from any Miyazaki film. A must see, overall!",10,0,0,22 July 2019
Castle in the Sky," An excellent Action-Adventure film
","The first official Studio Ghibli work. And what a work! My friend bought me this, and when I was through watching it, I thanked him. Seriously. I was so grateful to have seen it. While not my favorite Miyazaki film, it's probably in my top 3.Of all the Japanese voice actors, Mayumi Tanaka, (The voice of Monkey D. Luffy from 'One Piece'), does great as the main boy, Pazu. In the English dub, I really enjoy Mark Hamill's role as Muska. He's always been great at doing villainous voices.I'm also continuously impressed by the animation in Miyazaki's early works. Disney, eat your heart out. Beautiful stuff, and really fun and exciting!",10,0,0,22 July 2019
Princess Mononoke," A return to epics
","Miyazaki makes his return to creating epics with this film. While I can't say I like it more than 'Nausicaä,' I can definitely understand why this film was as popular and successful as it was.Let me just say though, it's probably Miyazaki's darkest, and most pessimistic, film. Severed heads, severed limbs, and a surprising amount of blood amd gore are featured in the film. No problem with this really, but it can be shocking coming off films like, 'My Neighbor Totoro.'Miyazaki counters this pessimism with his usual happy ending though, and it makes great use of his two major themes. Love, and respect for nature. In fact, the respect for nature theme may come off as heavy-handed for some, but it never bothered me.The film also has a wonderful English dub. A classic for a reason! Check it out!",10,3,4,22 July 2019
