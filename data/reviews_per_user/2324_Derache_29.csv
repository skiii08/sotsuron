Gremlins," A perfect christmas movie
","This movie is unique. Imagine little furry animal toys terrorizing a whole entire city during Christmas, there is simply nothing that can or ever will be better for a Christmas movie. Its just a simple, yet unique concept for a horror movie.",8,1,2,31 December 2018
Antz," Better for an older audience.
","This is a very good and underrated film, unfortunately its only known as a ripoff of a Disney movie, a bugs life, however it is nothing like that, and it is way better. This film goes through many themes such as romance, depression, conformity, communism, war, corruption in politics, and many many more. However the animation is done very poorly. Overall the movie is a very good watch, and I would definitely recommend it.",8,0,0,30 August 2019
Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing, Truthful, and Scary
","It starts off showing a beautiful utopia in a world on drugs and centralised around drugs. However, as it slowly goes on, the love inside of it dies, the truth comes out, and it becomes ever more disturbing. It is disturbing and true on every level of the show.It shows failure in the system, in doctors, in people, in drugs, and in life for the elderly people.Personally it struck something that was almost too parallel to my life to explain, not my own experience, but rather something of someone I care for. I often chose to ignore the disturbing reality as it scares me, however, this movie just shoved the truth right down my throat and made me swallow it whole. This movie is one of the most mentally and socially disturbing movies I have ever seen.",9,1,1,19 February 2019
Fight Club," A great psychological film.
","This is a great psychological film around the basis of having multiple personalities and the view of being crazy, with no recollection of it. It also includes one of the best plot twists in all of movie history. The deceive use of horror and thrill in this movie leads it to be one of the best movies of all time.I rate it a 10/10.",10,0,0,28 December 2018
Fight Club," A great psychological movie
","This is like Grand Theft Auto, San Andreas but instead in movie form and for white people.WHO DOESN'T WANT TO START A FIGHT CLUB AIRTIGHT, ITS KINDA BEAUTIFUL. It takes the concept of a fight club and turns it right on its head with one of the best plot twists in all of movie history.I would recommend watching this movie multiple times, and looking at the many morals that it teaches.",10,0,0,28 December 2018
Train to Busan," Love and Death
","It's just an amazing film that shows the growth of love through experiences together. Not only does it have a good character story, but it also has a good plot and setting to go along with it. Definitely would recommend.",8,1,3,5 May 2019
Shaun of the Dead," A new age classic.
","With a great director, a great script, and great actors in this film, it was bound to create an amazing balance of comedy and emotions. This film has some of the best camera work I have seen, the dialogue sometimes hit really amazing, with only a few memorable weak points. Almost all the main actors convinced me that they were the the characters they possessed.A few key moments in the film hit really hard, and the symbolism and use of camerawork is so rare to find in film, no matter the time period.The only weak character was Ed, he lacked development whilst all the characters developed or fell to their tragic flaws. However Ed, he was just annoying through the whole film.The ending also wasn't satisfying, however it is meant to be a comedy, but it should have been more serious.",9,0,1,6 December 2019
12 Angry Men," Reflection and Character
","A true drama filled with mystery. It deals with morals, problems within the political system in which we stand on, whilst also dealing with the strengths. It tells many tales showing the emotions and lives that many people live, and why the think the way they do. This was one of the most intense drama's I have ever watched and I would recommend it to anyone.",10,0,0,29 December 2018
Hot Fuzz," An amazing comedy
","This is not just a good British comedy, this is a good comedy no matter where you are from. It is very well done, and its a very fun movie to watch with many cinematic devices that are creatively used to accelerate the show's comedy. It is ultimately a British take on American action films that is done in an amazing way.
You are immersed into the film while also at the same time able to take in the meta jokes without it disrupting the film.",9,1,1,5 May 2019
The Terminator," A great thriller and horror action.
",This is a classic film about the ability of humans to make quick and meaningful bonds whilst in unity of hatred for someone of something else. It has some of the best acting and best film direction in all of movies.This is clearly a classic and I would recommend all to watch it.,10,1,3,28 December 2018
Nightcrawler," A relate-able psychological crime film
","This movie was great. Jake Gyllanhaal was an amazing actor in this film, as he typically is. I believe this film is one of the best films of the 2010's and has an amazing aesthetic theme to it.However it is not the film itself or the action that makes it amazing, it's the well written main character that holds everything together to make this great film. He is a relate able character that proves the point that anyone can be rich if they truly desire. However, being able to not care for others, is definitely an advantage in life.I would put this on my must-watch list.",9,1,1,5 May 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Hell of a life
","This may feel weirdly paced at times and often random, but it overall was a good movie with a good story. Nothing that deserves 8 or above, but it still was good. It was way better than I expected it would have been",7,1,2,12 February 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Cringy and unaware
","The character was a mediocre mess.
The art style was decent, the characters were either undeveloped, unnecessary, or both, the plot was mediocre at best, and the soundtrack was misplaced and misused.I believe this movie is another hyped up nerd movie just like black panther.",5,10,40,6 January 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The start of the format
","This is the best sequel of all time. The bad becomes the good, and then morality and what it means to be human is questioned. Action in this movie is beautiful, as and so is the concepts behind it.
Its a robot man coming to kill you. What's scarier?",8,0,1,31 December 2018
Yesterday," Okay concept, cheezy movie
","So this movie really didn't have much to do with the Beatles, It was more of a background plot that was happening to progress the real story, which was a romance between a guy and a girl. Of course, the whole concept of everyone forgetting was cool, but most of the movie was obnoxious and filled with crappy jokes. The remade Beatles music was done very well, however I feel like the movie was preying on nostalgia and really just selling a mediocre love story. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. I would recommend against watching it.",5,26,45,5 September 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Made for nerds.
","Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war.",4,13,18,5 May 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Unpredictable and inspired
","This movie, was a wild ride were i couldn't predict anything about the plot, but yet it still managed to have a great ending. It had unique characters, presentation, and plot. I would highly recommend this movie to tarintino fans and everyone else. Its very similar to pull fiction.",8,10,17,1 August 2019
Aladdin," A really well done movie
","The actors were done very well, of course not everything was perfect, and it was mainly aimed towards a nostalgic remake for couples and family's. The CGI was very well done, and the story was very well told. Of course there was some flaws, but the prince and the queen were very good actors along with the genie (will smith) were very great performances.
I highly recommend watching it.",8,0,2,5 September 2019
A Clockwork Orange," The Best movie of all time
",A genius movie filled with so many plot lines and so many complex themes. It is time to question the nature of humans and all of your morals. Whilst also learning about this dystopia reality. I can not stress how amazing this movie really is.A true horror and a thriller.,10,1,1,28 December 2018
Limitless," An original sci-fi
","It's always an amazing sensation to find a solid sci-fi film that presents new ideas and concepts. Sci-fi is based around the idea of 'a mans life, but...' and this show does it really well. I enjoyed a ton of this movie, although it did have some major flaws, such as some elements, scenes, animation, and characters. Along with an un-satisfying, and rather cringe ending. However, this show was really well done, and I highly recommend you watch it.",8,1,1,7 December 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," A disapointment
",I found the first movie to be a quite unique and funny movie to watch. In fact even after many years I still remember it. However the second movie is nothing more than a lackluster and forced sequel. The characters and story are all very bad.,3,1,2,7 May 2019
The Da Vinci Code," Interesting Plot and Actors
","This was a pretty good movie that had a interesting and immerse plot to follow. I do enjoy the characters in this film. Both of the main actors did a great job at playing their roles. They both felt like they aesthetically fit into how they acted. Especially the main female. Something always felt innocent and mysterious with her very dark eyes, fair skin, and speech patterns.The story itself was a interesting plot to follow and had it's twists and turns. It wasn't anything super genius or anything but it was definitely a well put together story. However, the setting was definitely an interesting setting. They did a very good job of presenting Paris in this movie.I would highly recommend watching this unique movie.",8,1,1,5 May 2019
Joker," Super Overhyped and Bland
","As I saw the reviews and the trailer for the movie, I thought I was gonna be in for a good or at least decent movie, but I must say, this was a huge letdown. The whole movie felt like just a backstory movie, leaving everything hanging and not really elaborating on the character himself. The script was poorly written and to sum up the movie, I would say 'Who cares', and how does this effect my life. Though the action was pre tight.",5,3,21,11 October 2019
Halloween," Everybody dies in their nightmares.
","This is single handily the best horror movie of all time. The tension and suspense of this thriller leaves nothing to mystery yet leaves so much to think about. An innocent girl was stalked, terrorized, and murdered all because of a unlucky coincidence.
This was not some paranormal or supernatural monster, it was a mere human that was an extreme sociopath sadist who picked a random victim. The scariest part is that this does happen in real life, and can happen to anyone.",9,0,0,29 December 2018
Wonder Woman," Terrible on all fronts
","It has terrible action, a terrible story, terrible characters, and most of all, terrible CGI. There is nothing here that could even define why this is liked by people, or even why it should exist.",1,5,12,16 May 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Objective Reality, and perception.
","The silence of the lambs is about a man named Hannibal Lector. The thing that I find fascinating with the show, and why I rated it an 8, is that they show a completely objective reality of a man.He has strives for what most people want. Money and knowledge, or at least in the earlier stages in life. Hannibal turns out to be not much more than a genius with the same thought process of a young child.Overall, it was an amazing movie and would definitely recommend it.",8,0,0,28 December 2018
Vanilla Sky," A ride of all emotions
","This was probably the scariest movie that I have ever watched. There were points when I was shivering. However, this movie wasn't based off one simple emotion or narrative, this was narrative of a whole life. I was nearly crying in some spots, shivering from fear in others, romantically entranced by others. This Movie is one of the best movies that I have personally ever watched and I definitely recommend everyone watches this heavily unrated movie.",10,1,4,7 August 2019
True Romance," A romance like no other!
","This whole story didn't rely on troubles or some unknown thing to make it hard on them. It was smooth and cool romance between a man with extreme confidence and his beautiful girl. A complete dream, true romance.",9,1,2,14 August 2019
The Breakfast Club," A Dystopia Clone Reality
",This movie is actually secretly hiding and predicting the future whilst showing that everyone will be the exact same but with a different facade to hide who they truly are. They are all truly clones of a human being just with the same desires but with different ideas on how to get them based on the teaching that they have revived.,7,1,1,25 February 2019
