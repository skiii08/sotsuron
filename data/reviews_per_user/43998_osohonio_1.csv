Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Bad
","The fusion-ed story was not that convincing. It was an experience of watching some back to back trailers. Not even a single idea was clearly stated. In order to mix two different ideas, politics and horror, nothing extraordinary was there. It terms of developing the plot I found it hardly good enough. Visual effects were good. Actions from the very beginning of the film were good. Although most of them were in slow motion. But only this one side was not good enough. It gave me some thrill at the last few minutes. So I am giving it a five from my point of view. Though action lovers may find it somewhere between in good and bad, it will be just to say it bad from a general view.",5,1,2,29 October 2012
