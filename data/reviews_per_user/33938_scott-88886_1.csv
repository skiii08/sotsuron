Hereditary," Full of sang froid, this one will cut you to the quick
","Finally!!! A fully realised, beautifully executed chiller. It brings to mind those legacy pictures that would leave you looking over your shoulder 7 times on your way from the sofa to the bathroom.Less of a stone cold JUMP horror, this does for grief what Jaws did for paddling in the shallows at the beach. Incredible performances across the board (apart from Peter's wailing which reminded me of a spoiled toddler) this one will quite literally haunt. Points to for one truly jawdropping moment in the narrative.Finally, if you watch this with a soundbar or similar higher end audio equipment, it is a tour de force. Stunning sound design abounds.",9,1,3,21 June 2019
