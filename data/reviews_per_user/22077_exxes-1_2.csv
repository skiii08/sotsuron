Source Code," Great film for those who are spiritually aware and wished to watch continuation of Matrix
","This movie has a spiritual meaning which you can only understand if you read and educate yourself about quantum psychics before hand. The script is not a brainer and it is very simple. You will guess the next scene without any doubt. If you are looking to watch a cleverly made, Matrix like science fiction, do not bother to watch this movie. You will find it not an exciting and loaded with virtual effects.However if you are practicing quantum psychics and you want to grow with the message embedded within the movie, go for it. This movie is not for everyone. This is definitely not a film which can win Oscars. acting is not an extraordinary as the script does not require actors to push themselves more. I gave 7 because it was predictable.",7,2,4,22 April 2011
Midnight in Paris," Can't imagine this movie got so many good reviews
","After reading reviews here, I have decided to watch this movie in Barcelona. Although I really did not like the way trailer has been put together, still wanted to give it a shot. Headed to a local cinema showing it in original language. As the trailer was telling me like 'don't go don't waste your time and money', it was beyond belief that some people will rate this movie highly just because its an another 'master' !? piece from Woody Allen.First of all movie is not a romantic comedy, its not a science fiction, its not a drama, its not a romantic drama nor its a comedy. Its a very creative idea of time traveling put in a very boring interrelated patterns.Acting is horrible as well. It could have been a great Hollywood comedy if directed better with better comedy lines. There was a single line which I laughed about Valium. That was something which they could have used throughout the movie.If you are not into literature and art, do not waste your time.",2,42,82,4 June 2011
