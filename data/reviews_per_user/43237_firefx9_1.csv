United 93," possible spoiler
","I saw this movie and what I am noticing is ONLY the people who want to believe that 9/11 was all about terrorism from abroad are going to see this movie. The performances were well done. My problem is, after watching the full documentary where it is CLEAR that this plane never crashed and was found later in another airport...how can I watch this film and be moved when I know that somewhere out there those passengers are either still alive or were murdered? It is documented that this flight landed and did not crash. Why is no one speaking on it and why are all the posts that mention it deleted????? This is not cool whomever is behind it. This movie was okay...but the real story is more compelling. What happened to all of those passengers on this flight when it landed?",1,23,79,1 May 2006
