The Ring," Bring your defibrillator
","First of all, when this movie first started, I thought it was going to be another Scream movie.  All of the elements were there:  the bad acting, lame lines, and the cheesiness of the scene with the two girls just made me cringe.  Within minutes this movie rapidly showed its true nature.  DO NOT BE FOOLED! This movie is all bite and no bark.  Yes, it is formulaic and the acting is sub-par, but that does not mean this is not going to scare you witless.  Let me put it to you this way, when they show the tape for the first time, YOU WILL BE SCARED.  Even knowing that this would be the breaking point of the film, I was not ready for the tape.  The images on the tape are the essence of good horror: reality gone horribly wrong.  It has all the artistry of indie films and gothic horror the likes of which Poe and Lovecraft would be proud of.  The rest of the movie is just window dressing, but there is nothing wrong with that.  This movie shows us how the formula is supposed to work, and that is something worth seeing.",Null,0,0,4 December 2002
The Rookie," Has the feeling of a worn out, old baseball glove
","This film has a lame soundtrack, a silly plot, and the sort of preprogrammed ending that feels contrived.  Still, it is the kind of movie that you walk away from feeling as if it somehow summed up everything important in the world, as if baseball really were everything that mattered.  Can we forgive the film's simplistic story in light of the multitude of subtleties that are left unspoken? I believe we can.  This isn't the sort of tearjerker that will traumatize you for the rest of the evening.  This movie is just like a game of baseball on a balmy afternoon.",8,1,1,11 May 2002
We Were Soldiers," Fails even at being a bad movie
","I feel ashamed that I was suckered into seeing this garbage.  I am not one of those people that dismisses war movies, but this film is just an insult to our collective intelligence.  In my opinion, there are two types of war movies, ones that tell stories and ones that exist for the action.  Both can be quite good, as anyone that has seen Black Hawk Down can attest.  Where this movies fails is in its attempt to do both at once.  What results is a film that has a horrible plot and just plain boring violence.  So what if some soldiers die, all I was doing was looking at my watch. 
I must confess I have not read the book and know little about Vietnam or war in general.  What I do recognize however are unconvincing action sequences filtered so that no one storms out of the theatre.  If there was even the slightest attempt to do research into the weaponry and tactics in the actual battle, I would not have been so badly disapointed.  As it is, all I see are a bunch of actors pretending to react to special effects.  Also,  for a movie that places so much emphasis on the 'brotherhood' of soldiers,  there is remarkably little concern shown to racial stereotypes in its plot.  The vietnamese are little more than cannon fodder in this film, and there isn't even an attempt made to show the trappings of real people.In conclusion, I would like for people to really think the next time they see a war movie:  is this American flag here really saying something, or is it just a colorful piece of scenery used to prop up the semblance of a story?  Films can do better.",Null,1,3,19 March 2002
Final Destination 2," I guess even Death has some lousy days at the office
","*Spoiler Alert*  It must be hard to be death, having to constantly think up new creative ways to bump people off as grusomely as possible.  Honestly, I can't blame him for just causing things to explode at random to get things done faster.  I mean why go through the trouble of messing with free will when you can just have respirators unplug themselves or cause people to immolate themselves in a fit of stupidity.  Luckily, this film is only an hour and a half because most of the audience is dying to escape after the first ten minutes.  This movie is only good at curing insomnia.",Null,0,0,1 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Really good but it could have been great
","I liked this film a lot.  It has all the good elements of the original trilogy, and Lucas has managed to at least downplay Jar Jar and the Trade Federation so that it doesn't interfere with the story.  Sadly, the worst oversite, the need of a new director, has not been remedied.  All the elements are there; the actors are all in top form, the special effects are quite good, and the plot, well, that is why we keep coming back.  What this film needed was someone, other than Lucas, to bring it all together. Someone has to restrain Lucas from throwing in way too much computer animation than he knows what to do with.  Sure the droid/clone battle may be the coolest thing we have ever seen, but it is the failures that really stick in your mind.  The beginning of the 'coliseum' seen is one of them. This seemed to just scream fake to me.  Don't get me wrong; the movie holds water, and time only makes an audience more accepting of the problems. Still, in the end we wonder what could have been.",8,0,0,16 May 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Surprisingly good
","I've been a lukewarm fan of the terminator series.  I watched the two previous films before seeing T3, and it really struck me that these films are more about hardcore action then a believable plot.  Not so with this film.  They brought back much of the writing talent from the first Terminator and it definitely shows.  People may complain about the lack of blood in this film, but I think it adds a sense of reality and suspense that it would not have otherwise.  There are plenty of explosions and action for the less intelligent, but for once these have been put second to good science fiction.  I've seen many films that have not managed this mix well. This film pokes fun at its occasional cheesiness so that we know the writers are sure where it's going.  This film has a surprise ending which alone is worth the price of admission.",9,1,1,3 July 2003
The Pianist," Much like Chopin, this film is overrated
","Seeing as how popular culture has all but killed classical music, I am always interested in the public's reaction to a film like this.  I find that many people seem to like pieces that are short and don't involve too much patience to listen to, whether they are aware of it or not.  I think that these people will love this film because Chopin's glorified elevator music is prominantly featured.For those of us hoping for something a little more interesting, this film is pretty dull.  If Polanski had really wanted us to know what the concentration camps were like, he could have used any of a number of different 20th century composers, some of which actually lived in these camps.  As it is, this film fails to capture the imagination. It is just a series of deadpan reactions interspersed with action sequences of questionable accuracy.  By the end of the film Szpileman is just a grizzled looking vagrant to us; he doesn't bear the weight of his experience on his soul.  It's a valiant effort, but ultimately this film is just average.",Null,0,1,12 March 2003
8 Mile," Fairly Tame Stuff
","I'm not a big fan of Eminem or of gangsta' rap in general, but I wanted to see what this film was like.  It seems to me, from what little I could understand of the rap lyrics, that most of the films songs are little more than weak insults interspersed with the occasional curse.  I'm guessing the problem is that Eminem did not actually wright most of the film's music. Not that I encourage potty mouth lyrics, but most of what they say would even be permissible on television (shock!).  Without any sort of edge to its songs, this movie is just a tired rehash of better rags to riches stories. Honestly, go rent Scarface and you will see that that movie makes 8 Mile look like an episode of Barney and Friends.",Null,0,0,13 November 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," The Matrix Unloaded
","I would have said this movie is okay, but I have been given the equivalent of a slap in the face: no one gives me a 'To Be Continued' and expects the gloves to stay on.  I encourage everyone, be they man, woman, child, animal, vegetable, or mineral to spend their money elsewhere then on a movie ticket for this thing.  I expect 'To Be Continued' when I am watching some pointless sitcom on television, throwing this into a film is just wrong. Your time and money should be valuable enough to expect some sense of resolution after spending two hours with a film.  I don't care if a movie is two hours long or six hours long, I want to feel that I have accomplished something besides indebting myself another movie ticket to see the ending. This is a disgrace.  A hard wipe to the credits would have been a thousand times more tactful.That being said I must take a deep breath and tell you my other thoughts on this piece of work (It's a piece of something all right).  At best, this is just a screensaver of action sequences.  This would be okay if they did not pause every five seconds as if my computer were freezing up.  It's as if the filmmakers did not think we could understand a car being smashed without seeing it occur over about five minutes.  Action is action, and slow action is BOOOOOOOORRING.  The rest of the film is a feeble attempt to coble a story together.  You can throw in every word in the dictionary and use every trick of circular reasoning to try to make it seem intelligent, but no one is fooled: you could drive a truck through the plot holes in this movie. There are loose ends beyond count, and even one should be a  travesty.  I give this movie a to be continued.",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Spent a little too much time in the bathroom
","In light of all the reviews mooning over how great this movie is I would like to add my two cents.  I think the film is very good, just like the first movie, but it is not the greatest film ever made by any stretch of the imagination.  I realize many people see this as a kid's movie and thus being above criticism, but I actually think these movies were made for adults. How many kids under 10 do you know that can sit through three hours of movie?  It just seems to me, that when you see a film like Toy Story which says more in under 90 minutes then this movie does in three hours, you have to think about how it could have been better.  So much of the Potter films seems to rest on gimmicks: things that look really cool but ultimately serve as just backdrop.  Harry Potter has these amazing adventures without even the slightest amount of self-doubt.  This seems especially impressive when he confronts CG terrors that cause even adults to shiver.  Ultimately though there is no message that Harry Potter also feels fear and is therefore human.  I give this movie an A+ for direction, story, acting, and special effects.  For heart I give it an F.",Null,0,0,20 November 2002
Rosemary's Baby," Should be in the top 10 horror films
","I don't want to spend this review gushing about how good this film is and blah blah blah.  It is a masterpiece of cinema, bar none.  This movie is probably second only to the Exorcist because it is one of only a few films in the true gothic tradition.  Anyone that has read HP Lovecraft knows what I am talking about. Everything is designed just slightly askew, like the way the characters eat too fast or that bizarre accent of the lady next door. Nothing is as it seems, and that is the true beauty of it. 
My complaint is that films like this do not receive the respect they deserve.  In today's MTV culture anything that isn't exploding every five minutes is a sleeper.  What happened to the time when people had the patience to watch a film that had depth to it?  I realize that being in the top 30 of the IMDB ranking should be quite good, but why isn't it number 2? I enjoy comedy as much as the next person, but a film like Young Frankenstein does not deserve to be occupying spots in a serious genre. This film is like a painting by Picasso, and the rest are just comic books.",10,1,2,28 April 2002
Scream," Wow, this is a bad film
","I would like everyone that actually likes this film to consider this for a moment.  This movie is neather scary nor funny.  It lacks any of the energy of the films that it lists in its poorly written dialogue.  Please, do yourself a favour and rent a movie like the Exorcist and see what a horror movie should be.  No one should feel that by mocking the horror genre, Wes Craven has created a masterpiece.  This is an insult to our collective intelligence.",1,5,19,1 December 2001
Signs," Not Shyamalan's best work, but still a good movie
","This is one of those films that I don't like as much, primarily because I came in expecting it to be so much better.  I don't know what it is about the best horror films, but you almost have to go in with the right frame of mind.  Perhaps it was in the minute of the film I missed when I went to the bathroom in the middle, but the critical element that brings it all together just wasn't there for me.  I am a true fan of Shyamalan's work, but I just felt that this wasn't his best.  He excels so much at inserting the cereberal elements into the film that it should be great, but in the end it is the little things that destroy it.  I think perhaps the weakest element may have been Mel Gibson's acting.  Too many of his scenes in the film seem confused to be a coincidence.  Otherwise, the actors are great, especially Joaquin Pheonix.  I would recommend any fan of Shyamalan's other work to see the film, because I firmly believe that it can only get better from here.",Null,0,1,11 September 2002
