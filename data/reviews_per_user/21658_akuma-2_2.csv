The Rock," Action, suspense, this movie doesn't disappoint
","This movie although it has a weird storyline that has a twist at the end,doesn't fail to impress with its good acting,action suspense. Cage and Connery are a good team but typically in a movie are the only ones who survive out of the 10-20 who go in.Even after you've seen this movie you won't find it boring to see it again. Highly recommended",8,1,1,10 April 1999
Blade," Awesome fighting scenes
","Blade is a good movie but not that good.The special effects are good but real weird especially when the vampires explode.The story isn't groundbreaking but you don't come to see this movie for the story.What you come see this for are the stunning fight scenes they are some of the best I've ever seen,especially at the end.In the end Blade is worth getting out just for its action but it might be different to what you think it might be.",6,0,1,10 May 1999
