Walk the Line," Abseloutely fantastic, best film this year
","For the past two years, the academy awards for best actor and best actress have been dominated by performers seeking to portray real life characters. From 'Ray' to 'Capote', 'the Aviator' to 'Finding Neverland' it would seem that the biopic is well and truly on the up. As such, the arrival of yet another misty-eyed trawl through the early years of a musical legend, country crooner Johnny Cash, came as little surprise.Coincidentally, surprises are few and far between in the actual film. It is predictable, formulaic, clichéd and cheesy in all senses  blazing talent saved from drug hell by the love of good woman. Yet, despite that, it is ridiculously enjoyable (and I'm not even joaquing)! The film focuses on the earliest (and most interesting) parts of Johnny Cash's life, from the death of his brother to the infamous gig he played at Folsom prison in 1968. This allows them to really cash in on the palpable chemistry between Witherspoon and Phoenix, as they battle his drug addiction and their feelings for each other. In fact, their performances are without doubt the best part about this film. Even with his first-rate brooding bad boy of an on screen presence, Joaquin Phoenix is overshadowed by a magnificent Reese Witherspoon. Her reese-nt Oscar victory is much deserved for a truly stunning performance.What makes the performances even more commendable is that both Phoenix and Witherspoon sing their own songs, rather than relying on miming. This lends an authenticity to what is already a fantastic set of songs, giving the film a great buzz and atmosphere to it.",10,1,3,15 August 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Fantastic remake
","After a simply super Spring of Star Wars, Sin City and umm... Batman, I must confess that I feared the subsequent season would be unable to compete. And I feared I might be right until Tim Burton teamed up with Johnny Depp (who else!) to produce summerthing really special - a deliciously dark big screen remake of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.The tale is centred around Willy Wonka's mysterious chocolate factory which nobody has entered for years and which appear for all the world to be deserted. 'The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy'. That is until Mr Wonka decides he needs an heir and so opens his legendary doors for five lucky children. All the children are fantastically well acted given the tender years of the performers and 12-year-old Freddie Highmore, in particular, gives a superbly accomplished performance as young Charlie. But as heart-warming as Charlie's innate goodness is, and as amusing as Augustus Gloop's innate German-ness is; the real star of this show is Johnny Depp as the simultaneously creepy, hilarious, pitiful and peculiar Willy Wonka.One of the reasons he is Hollywood's hottest property is the deppth and versatility of his acting. He can change effortlessly from a swashbuckling rogue in 'Pirates of the Caribbean', a drug-dealing family man in 'Blow' and now this oddball chocolatier. There is more than a hint of Wacko Jacko about his childlike performance with that familiar nervous giggle and aura of naivety. Most of the film's comedy comes through him, and I often found myself chockling at lines like 'Everything in this room is edible. Even I'm edible. But that is called cannibalism, my dear children, and is in fact frowned upon in most societies.' And so on to the inevitable comparisons with the 1971 original. For me, Johnny Depp easily outstrips Gene Wilder in the lead role and screenwriter John August doesn't fall in to the trap of attempting to simply replicate the original. The addition of flashbacks to Wonka's troubled childhood is simply genius and as a whole, this 2005 version is without doubt new and improved. The visual effects and fine performances make for an almost flawless film with only two weaknesses. Firstly, the modern oompah loompahs just lacked the creepy humour of the old ones. But most importantly, Augustus Gloop did not get a large enough role  greedy, overweight Germans make good viewing!",9,0,3,19 January 2006
Green Street Hooligans," Disappointing glorification of football hooliganism
","Elijah Wood's two-year honeymoon period after Lord of the Rings has finally worn off. The baby-faced and huge-eyed 24-year-old returns to a lead role in this gritty study of football-related violence and really couldn't have been less suited to the role if he'd tried. He plays Matt, a young journalism student who moves to London after being expelled from Harvard. With no Gandalf to keep him on the straight and narrow, Wood falls in with a bad crowd - hooligans with a nasty hobbit of getting into booze-fuelled, adrenaline-pumping brawls after West Ham matches. As Matt moves deeper and deeper into the violent Green Street Elite, the tension builds, as other members turn against their new American comrade-in-arms.Ultimately however, despite it's potential, the film is a disappointment, a nil-nil draw. Charlie Hunman, who plays the gang's leader, has a cockney accent less convincing than Dick Van Dyke's in 'Mary Poppins' and Elijah Wood seems more suited to playing that practically perfect nanny than he is to being a blood thirsty thug. Like 'The Football Factory' before it, 'Green Street' seems to glorify, rather than condemn, mindless violence without any of the storyline or performances of Alan Clarke's 'The Firm', a much better take on working class football fanatics.",7,0,0,19 January 2006
