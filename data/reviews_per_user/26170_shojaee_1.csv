Scarface," Hitchcock and De Palma
","Always asked myself what`s fimiliar between hitchock and de palma and what are those 'things' de palma got from hithcock. wathcing movies like 'Mission Impossible' didnt give me the answer. but i found a good one in scarface. Remember that scence, tonny met his family for the first time? pay attention to his mother. how he acts and specially how he looks at tonny. Familiar? We`ve seen this special mother`s look in many of hitchcock film, as the ones i`ve got in mind: 'The Birds' and 'Notorious'.",9,0,1,19 February 2004
