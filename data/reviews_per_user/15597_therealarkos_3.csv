Blade Runner 2049," My first 3/10 review.
","The hype surrounding this film (especially from 'High Art' YouTube content creators such as YMS) is very much undeserved.
Because of it - 
'...Cementing itself as one of the best sequels of all time'
<ul><li>is quite objectively wrong.</li></ul>I do find myself stunned at how well some of the settings are blended with CGI, dazzling use of colour, and excellent set design.
But in retrospect, there is almost nothing else to commend. The dialogue is above average, considering its nature as a modern day sequel, and helps to build unique and interesting characters, but is then wasted with an atrocious, unbelievably awful ending. 
There is little to no action, which would help to reinforce stakes, so instead at no point are you remotely concerned for any of the main characters.Even as a thought provocative movie this fails on all fronts. The story is patchy at best and at points many options made by the characters felt unnecessary and unrelated to the situation at hand. Massive plot holes, such as there being numerous way for the vital information withheld to be leaked to the public, completely ruin anything - anything - of worth about this film on that front. It was a very unsatisfying conclusion to the franchise and at this point I almost want a sequel to fix the state of this series of films. Frankly embarrassing.",3,3,8,2 September 2018
Coraline," Well then.
","By far my favourite animated film, this movie caught me completely off guard with its unnerving and creatively unique turn towards the 3rd act.
I would highly recommend this film. It is dark yet intriguing, and really quite terrifying, all while establishing brilliant characters with understandable motivations.",9,0,1,18 August 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Could be significantly worse.
","Two things very quickly:
<ul><li>I am not an obsessive fanboy of this franchise</li><li>This movie is not as bad or good as people are saying</li></ul>IT IS A VERY AVERAGE MOVIE. There are some elements that seemed very consistent, given the characteristics of the other films in the franchise. Some scenes brilliantly utilize colour and very good shot composition. On the other hand, there are elements that break the universe and ruin a number of the movies prior to it.Example:
Is there always the risk of hitting natural satellites when entering hyperspace?
If so, Han, Luke, and the other characters aboard the Millennium Falcon in ep4 would all be dead about 45 minutes in.Personally:
The Canto Blight Subplot is hated, but it was at that point I found myself gaining interest. The force hologram makes sense if Luke was not able to get to Crait in time.",5,1,6,15 August 2018
