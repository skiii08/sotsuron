The New World," A unique story telling expirience
","Hello and welcome to my review on The New World. I watched this movie for a U.S History through film class and here are my thoughts on it. The filmmaker (Terrance Malick) tells the story of exploratory captain John Smith, and how he comes to meet the other main character Pocahontas, a native american girl living in America. John Smith runs into her when he gets lost on a trading exhibition to reestablish his position as captain. The natives want to kill him, but right before he's about to be killed, Pocahontas throws herself on him to save his life. He then spends time living among the natives (or naturals as they are called. This is something very important to know that will help you understand the film better). He learns their ways and culture and in return, he teaches her his ways and language. I won't spoil the rest, you have to watch and find out. For the most part, this film is pretty well executed. The framing is clean, the colors are distinct, and the camera quality is great (for 2005). There are some things that I raised an eyebrow to concerning this films historical accuracy. Number one, by the end of the film, Pocahontas is completely are nearly fluent in English. This is odd considering the fact that near the end of the film, John Rolfe uses some very sophisticated English when talking to Pocahontas. She somehow understands all of it, and the emotion behind the language.",9,2,2,30 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A hilarious bit of Nostalgia infused Marvel
","This movie had a certain 80's, neon, electronic style to it that is very close to how Guardians of the Galaxy is. It is full of funny jokes, good packed action sequences, and well lets face it, most serious moments get ruined by jokes. there is one exception to this and that would be when Odin passes on. It is a very heartfelt moment with Thor and Loki, because as much as they tease and hate each other, they don't want to see their father go. Other than that one scene, the rest of this movie is a comedic explosion of color.",8,3,5,18 September 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Best Buds, Partners, and Bank Robbers through and through
","Now I have watched this film before, but it doesn't change the fact at still how great it is! The story line and the dialogue is a huge part of this movie, and its probably one of its best features. There are so many funny and great lines in this movie, they add to the completion of the film so well.
Visuals are excellent for the time period. The film is good and colorful considering it was shot in 1969. The costumes, the settings, and the props are all great and add so much depth to the experience.
Considering all of these things put together, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a classic, and a great one at that! I strongly recommend you watch this",9,2,3,23 October 2018
Interstellar," A graceful duet of Sci-Fi and Reality
","Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. 
The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. 
The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. 
The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. 
Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. 
All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more.",10,2,3,18 September 2018
The Alamo," For Texas
","Now I have not seen the 1960 version of this film with John Wayne, so I will not try to compare them or tell you which one is better. This film is entertaining as it is. 
If you are bored and you scrolling through Netflix, and happen to stumble upon this film, sure you can watch it. But if your not a historian or a hard core american, you might not enjoy it all to well. But that being said, this film isn't all bad. 
John Lee Hancock's The Alamo is a loud mix of tender, tense, and battle torn scenes. You have a sense of understanding and connection with the characters. This is one of the films good qualities. Something this film doesn't accomplish well or even focus a lot on is picking out a main character. Depending on what part of the film your in, the focus can shift between Sam Houston to Davy Crockett to William Travis and then back to Houston. This can make it a tiny bit difficult to know who your supposed to be paying attention. Also there is a random young man in the Mexican army who they focus a good chunk of time on. Your never told his name, what he says, or even his role. Its not up until the very end when his role in the story comes. In the final battle among the confusion, he pulls his trigger, hitting the American general. After that scene, we never see this boy again. 
Overall however, even with the low points, this movie more than makes up for it in visuals, dialogue, and overall flow. There are points where you can't help but laugh and times when you just have to sit there in silence. The visuals are great and very accurate, from the clothing to the battles, to the overall style of the film. 
If you like being an American, or just want a good old battle, then this is definitely for you.",8,1,1,9 October 2018
The Lego Movie," The Lego film that needed to happen
","Now, I know this film has its annoying spots and very child oriented areas, but when it comes to Lego films of the past, this film is leagues ahead. Lego films in the past either weren't professionally made, or when they were made, the Lego bricks themselves would behave and act in ways that they can't in real life due to their physical mechanics. In past films, mini fig's would move in ways that would bend and melt the plastic, or have human like faces that would scare the crap out of you. Also bricks and mini fig's would be combined with real life environments. So for example you'd have Lego Anakin Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi in a cantina, but the cantina looks like it does in the film, not done in Lego. In The Lego Movie however, you can look at just about any scene or area, and you can create that with Lego in real life. For the most part as well, the physical mechancis of Lego are respected in this film too. In addition to the life like movement, with how good the animation was, your first time watching this film you have to ask yourself if its animated or actual stop motion. The animation is THAT detailed. As you go through and watch it, you'll find subtle things like fingerprints or scratches on mini figs, printing on bricks, even mold numbers on certain pieces. This attention to detail is what makes the Lego movie the Lego movie that everyone has wanted for so long.",10,1,1,1 October 2018
The Fast and the Furious," The start of it all
","Fast and Furious. The first one. This film came out a month before I was born, and I've only just watched now in 2018. Do I like it? Does it hold up? Let me explain.
Ever since I can remember, I've been into cars. Always have, always will be. Now, when Hollywood tries to make a film about car culture, did they get it right? Sort of.
This movie has so much good about it. The story is just solid. Car guys and girls just being themselves, sticking together. Lets you know a bit of what its like to have a crew. All the cars are iconic. Dom's Black Dodge Charger and Red Mazda RX-7, Brian's Orange Toyota Supra and Green Mitsubishi Eclipse. So many other cars that back in the day and even today look absurd with the styling and parts, but are classics because of the movies that made them. And this movie started all of it. You can't talk about tuner culture or drag racing or even Paul Walker without bringing this film up. This film had its rough spots, but those imperfections are what make this film so iconic and loved.
So, did Hollywood make a car film true to the culture? It's 50/50. They got the racing and the tuning and the whole feel of the scene, but also added in the heists and back turning that is so classic Hollywood. This film is classic, and still means something to me today.",10,1,1,19 November 2018
Wonder Woman," Why can't sniper guy shoot?
","When it comes to superhero movies, I will say that Marvel is a tiny bit better at making great superhero films compared to DC. BUT, considering that, Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero movies I've seen to date. Heres why.
Superhero films that contradict with actual world history don't typically please me, but this one was good. Gal Gadot did a fantastic job in this role. She pulls it off perfectly. All the other characters play their roles extremely well. Everything from the environment to the sets to the special effects to the costumes. It all contributes to the nice, appealing look of this superhero film. There are funny parts, and super intense parts.
My 2 nit picks with this film are that it seems General Ludendorff was the only German general with an actual German accent. Um, and the other one was that the filtering in this film seemed a bit over done in some areas. But overall great film!",10,2,2,15 November 2018
The Great Escape," A great classic
","Most people have never watched or even heard of this movie, but for those of you that have, lets all just sit back in silence for a few moments on how great it was.Alright now that thats done, I can review this. I only watched this very recently but even still after 55 years, it still holds up with its story and acting. The acting in this movie is fantastic. For the most part, the actors put as much emotion into the characters as possible, and it shows evident in how this film turned out. Even though it is based on real life events, it still is a masterpiece of cinema all the same. Steve McQueen's character is cocky and likable, while Richard Attenborough's character is stern and smart. Overall, this is a lovable classic of traditional storytelling.",10,2,2,18 September 2018
Cinderella Man," Crouch shot really man? You have to stoop that low?
","Cinderella Man is the story of James J. Braddock, an American boxer who looses his rise to fame at the beginning of the Great Depression. This movie has such a feeling and an emotion exerted from it that many films strive for but lack. The love between him and his wife and kids, between him and his coach. The ups and downs he and his friends and family face in this movie really show the feeling of the Great Depression.
When it comes down technically to this movie, it performs amazingly. The shots are layered and composed so well. The filtering and color balance of the shots creates a sort of world and atmosphere that pulls you, adding a layer on top of the story and acting. The casting as well was brilliant.Russel Crowe both in looks and acting pulls off an astounding performance as Braddock. Renee Zellwegger is a fitting role for Braddock's wife Mae. Crowe paired with the accent and style of Paul Giamatti make the team look like unstoppable underdogs.
This film tells a story filled of hope, emotions, and overall realism that is hard to achieve in cinema. If you watch this, it will pull at the heart strings, but in the best way possible.",10,1,1,4 December 2018
