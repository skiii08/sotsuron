Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I waited in line for this?
","**Spoilers, Maybe**When the only cool parts of the film is when the villian is onscreen (Dark Maul), you have a problem... ...Especially when you are rooting for the cool villian, more than the suppossed heroes...----------------------------------------------------------------------I expected more due to the overwhelming hype that surrounded this film...(actually, I found 'The Matrix' the best film of 1999)...",1,0,1,25 November 2001
Blade II," COOL!!!
","*SPOILERS, POSSIBLY*An acquaintance of mine complained that the original movie showed Blade as being too invulnerable....This one made him a bit more 'human'...(even having him involved in a short-lived romance with the beautiful vampire Nyssa)...The next one is to be directed by David S.Goyer who wrote the two Blade pictures...I'm looking forward to it..",10,2,4,25 March 2002
