Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," LOTS OF FUN
","The Phantom Menace is lots of fun.I had read a lot of negative reviews before.  I don't know what movie they were watching.  I had so much fun watching the movie.  I'm sure I'll watch it again...and again...and again...Some people are too critical.  Some movies make us laugh, others make us cry and still others are just fun.  Star Wars has never been anything more than that and this new episode definitely delivers.",Null,0,0,19 May 1999
