Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funniest movie ever !!!!
",I have to start out by saying that this is the funniest movie I have ever seen. From the start to the end I was on the floor laughing. I have watched this movie five times already and every time I watch it I am hysterical.He is a great actor to pull off what he did in this movie. I really can't even think if a funniest scene in this movie just because every scene was great. You have to have a good sense of humor to watch this movie.... If not then don't even bother wasting your time. If you think that there is a funnier movie out than this than please let me know I would love to see it. But again I really doubt that there is anything even possibly as funny as this movie is.,10,34,51,3 November 2007
