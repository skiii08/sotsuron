Lucky Number Slevin," Don't waste your money or time on this movie
","I watched this movie last night after reading seeing the high reviews it received here. However, the film was kind of confusing and done before, child comes back to take murdered parents revenge. The only good part of the film is the first 15 mins of the movie... It starts off really well than falls off completely when lucy lui, the grown child slevin come into the picture.. Anyway it was a waste of money and time even forwarded parts of the film. Overall 2 thumbs down.As I am forced to submit 10 lines of text, yeah the beginning of the film was really good, the whole hustle and shuffle that was going on was, good and getting an idea of what the movie may be about seemed as if the movie had major potential but it was boring and lucy lui and slevin's relationship ruined what could have been replaced with a greater plot..",2,6,14,15 October 2006
Knocked Up," Are viewers really sooooo dumb and lost...
",I gave this movie a 1 for the basic fact of it being empty and without substance. It is a film about a female who has a good job and is 'successful' who goes out after given a promotion and has sex with a fat ass at a club which she regrets but ends up having to live and falls in ?love with a fat overweight pot head. The male character has no character what so ever and the female in the film is sooo washed its not even funny. A dope fiend gets a girl pregnant and we are supposed to feel that the girl in the film is more special than the guy. I don't think so happens everyday. This movie is about Nothing! Films like this are enjoyed by people who don't have a brain and laugh at a person passing gas. Give me break.,1,46,85,8 June 2007
