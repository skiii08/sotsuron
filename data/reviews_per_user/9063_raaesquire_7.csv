Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," sub par
","i really enjoyed the phantom menace when i first saw it, way back in 1999. i was 12 years old, and of course at that time, star wars was my favorite film. however, there are differences between a film and a movie. this is just a big budget popcorn flick, and while george lucas has tried to make an attempt at telling the first three events of the star wars saga, it just doesn't work - on a technological scale and on a scale of substance. first off, the most obvious thing is that the film employs the usage of computerized special effects, which points out a horrible continuity gap between the new trilogy and the old one, even with minimal computerized effects added in those. as far as the acting is concerned, the only ones it seems to be natural for is liam neeson and ewan macgregor. i personally would not have had obi wan kenobi as a 'padawan learner' in this trilogy, but rather as a reckless jedi who is eager to train someone under his wing (think anakin in episode III). the writing just doesn't work, and the storyline is simply too damn long. and a trade war? what's that about? it is simply too complex at times. i also would have had anakin older, say between the ages of 16 and 18. the good thing about the original star wars movies was that they used adult actors to appeal to the kid in everyone. here, it isn't working; something is missing. one cannot help but feel cheated, as george lucas rereleased the original trilogy in 1997 not because it was the 20th anniversary of the original star wars, but because it was preparing for the release of the new movies. the new ones, as it seems, have simply tarnished my view on the originals, but you cannot blame george lucas at all. this is his story, and however he wants to tell it, he should just do it however he damn feels like it. but my suggestion is to get your hands on the original versions of the original trilogy, and eat those up. fast.",4,0,1,18 March 2006
Citizen Kane," Rosebud
","The greatest film of all time. Who ever knew that the greatest American film could be so... European? Rumor has it that Orson Welles saw Le Jour Se Leve, and the fotogenie of that film influenced him to adopt some of the camera techniques that were used for this landmark of cinema. It is infused with minimal comedy (seeing the young Kane starting a newspaper is perhaps the most lighthearted moment in the film), epic drama, detail, detail, detail, a powerful storyline and message (money doesn't buy happiness), brilliant writing, dialogue, camera work, and acting, especially on welles' part. the greatest thing about citizen kane? welles has given us the key to figuring out the enigma that is the title character through the revelation of rosebud. i had a huge grin on my face when this was pointed out to me in my film study class. However, we can sit here and praise Kane for all we want, but the point is that works of art such as this are being ignored by many people who are my age (19). many will opt for stoner flicks, cheap horror movies, and mind numbingly dull action movies. too many people are stuck in the star wars state of mind, and i've moved on beyond that. years ago. if people are serious about cinema, they'll take exactly two hours of their time to view citizen kane. you may not catch on at first, but with subsequent viewings, it flows much more easier. but this is merely a pipe dream of mine, but i'll give you my testament. i just decided to see citizen kane one day, because i felt it shouldn't be voted as the greatest film of all time. i was wrong - dead wrong.",10,0,1,18 March 2006
Crash," So this is what it's come down to.
","In 1994, there was a little film called Pulp Fiction which almost had the sort of concept. Within a 36-48 hour period, everyone's lives would collide. Maybe Pulp Fiction appealed more to pop culture interests, but Tarantino did the job effectively (as Pulp Fiction is the only film of his I genuinely like). Now, flash forward to 2005, and this concept, already explored 10 years ago, is the darling of critics. For what reason? Crash deals with prejudice they say. Wow. I guess To Kill A Mockingbird doesn't. The writing is poor, and the acting is simply lousy. At the beginning of the film, Don Cheadle says something about everyone's lives crashing together. No kidding. A white guy starts a verbal fight with a Muslim by calling him Osama. And really, when you see the film, the fight was instigated for no reason. Matt Dillon pulls over an African-American couple because the wife was performing fellatio on her husband? Who comes up with this stuff? Then, to make it worse, he feels her up. What is going on here? One of the most hysterical parts was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. The way they made it out to be was as if she died or something. Don't even get me started with the Muslim man 'encountering an angel' that he shot with blank bullets. I guess he'll be like Samuel L. in Pulp Fiction and try to find God. Or how about the hideous banter between Ludicrous and his partner? Again, Paul Haggis tried to make this look like Pulp Fiction. And I knew right from the get-go that Ludicrous' partner was Cheadle's brother, although there is no mention of this until the middle of the film. And what about the Chinese lady who got into the car accident with Don Cheadle's partner? It just doesn't add up. I know everyone on this website is going to chastise me for tearing this film to shreds, calling me 'an idiot' or I didn't see 'the significance' of it. This was not the best picture of 2005, as the Academy has once again stooped to a new low by picking this garbage over actual art.Best American Films of 2005: Good Night and Good Luck 8/10 Brokeback Mountain 8/10 Capote 8/10 The Squid And the Whale 7.5/10 and yes...

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," In defense of Attack of the Clones...
","i give it only has a 5/10. Why? The acting is very wooden, and of course the CGI was terrible. But, I can only deduct 3 stars because of this. Why? First off, acting was NEVER the strong point of Star Wars (Remember Princess Leia in the first one, talking in a British accent in a few scenes? Jesus!). The cast here is assembled of good actors. With the exception of Ewan McGregor and Ian McDirmid and Christopher Lee(Who pull their roles off brilliantly), Hayden Chistensen and Natalie Portman overacted to actually make the horrible script sound good. They tried to hard - if you saw them in other films they did, I think you'd get a different perspective on their acting. But it was the writing. As for the computer effects, well it looks too cartoonish in many places. Even Yoda's sword fight didn't impress me. So, what was good about this movie? Well, you do see traces of Vader every now and then. You see the Clone Wars unfold and the 'plans' for the Death Star. I give Attack of the Clones 7/10 because it must be deliberately weak to pave way for Revenge of the Sith, which I am sure will be far more superior to this one. You could only wish that George Lucas would have had a plot line that would have accommodated the more superior special effects of the original trilogy. That's right - I do believe the effects from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi are way better than these. Oh well, you can't win 'em all.",5,1,2,17 May 2005
Saw III," Crap is Crap is Crap
","Maybe it's just me, but the horror genre has no real artistic merit. The only horror films that matter are Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Rosemary's Baby, Night of the Living Dead, Psycho, The Exorcist, Halloween, and even Evil Dead (not the other two, it became a parody of itself like the other long winded franchises). Otherwise than that, how could anyone feel confident about the American cinema today after seeing garbage like this? I certainly can't, as Saw III (just like its predecessors, possibly the two worst films ever made) takes the title as worst film of 2006.The reason why the Saw franchise is considered great by the fans that believe in it because there is essentially no difficult content: there's blood, guts, and gore right in your face, plastic dialogue, screaming, yelling, and predictable plot twists explained at the end of the movie instead of having the viewer feel free to interpret things on his or her own. This is the sad status of mainstream Hollywood today: the executives notice a trend and exploit it. The horror genre was never good to begin with from its inception unlike the comedy genre, which was very intelligent in the beginning, but now we get films such as Employee of the Month with that jackass Dane Cook. An interesting film genre was exploited by the studios many years ago. Sure, they were in it for the money, but one little movie caused an uproar. It was called Citizen Kane, and it was a major player (not the only one) that kicked off the film noir genre. While film noir was not the most uplifting of genres, it had different narratives, was cleverly written (see no further than the Maltese Falcon or Sunset Blvd), and effectively reflected the mood of the times. So, I suppose the pointlessly bloody gorefest flicks with possessed children and stupid puppets in videos serves as expressionism of people's frustrations over America's status in the world? No, absolutely not. What 14 year old kid is going to think about this stuff when seeing Saw III? The only thing I was thinking about was how much money I wasted over seeing this crap. I could have seen a relatively unknown picture (with a lot of critical buzz) such as Brick or good mainstream fare (The Departed, even though it has the pretty faces of DiCaprio and Damon present).The sad thing is that Saw III will be so much of a rousing box office success this weekend that studio execs will be pressuring for a forth one, but real film fans know full well that 2 sequels to the original were definitely unnecessary.The only things that uplifted my spirits after seeing Saw III was that I will not have to see it again because it was so bad, Borat comes out next week, and that I went home and watched a real work of cinematic art entitled 'The 400 Blows' by Francois Truffaut. If you think Jigsaw teaches a valuable lesson to ungrateful people by torturing them, Francois Truffaut teaches a lesson 10000000000 times more worth the value: you don't want to be a punk kid wandering the streets of France without parents who don't love you.See that instead or any foreign film for that matter instead of Saw III.",1,6,15,29 October 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," The Best Picture of 2005
","While I rate Good Night, and Good Luck with an 8/10, that is because it is not perfect, nor were the excellent films (except for Crash) that were also nominated for best picture. Good Night and Good Luck is definitely an excellent educational piece for aspiring journalists and politicians. It is good to note that Murrow defied the advertisers and the executives by offering his opinion in an intelligent matter, unlike using 'comedy' or exploiting the woes of others (Michael Moore, the hacks at Fox News). Murrow had a sense of dignity about him, and was able to take down the ruthless McCarthy. If Murrow can use his wits to take down that jackass, any journalist can abandon dependence on technology's excesses to bring down the criminals that run this country today. But, we are fat and comfortable, as Mr. Murrow said.As for the film itself...It's not perfect. While I offer my Kudos to George Clooney for integrating actual footage of McCarthy and so forth, sometimes you can't help but feel such a method causes an uneven balance between the actors in the film and archival footage. But, this is only minor, as it is more effective than having actors play McCarthy and his cronies.The good parts obviously outweigh the minor problems: Straitharn should've been the best actor of 2005. The writing is top notch, as the length of the film is perfect to get an adequate message across. George Clooney did not deserve Best Director at the Academy Awards (as Ang Lee, a more experienced director, won this award), but watch out for him in the future. After seeing Good Night and Good Luck, it certainly seems bright.How Crash, with its horrible portrayal of race relations, won Best Picture over this, well I don't know.",8,0,0,4 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," meh
","revenge of the sith is the strongest installment of the final chapter of the star wars saga, but it just doesn't deliver everything i expected. given the negative reviews that were given to the phantom menace and attack of the clones, it seems that george lucas was more than ever trying to make a movie that would appease critics and critical fans alike. while acting is much stronger this time around, i felt the notion that natalie portman was simply useless in this one. and too, vader's turn to the dark side seems too swift. we could have seen more interaction between the chancellor and vader throughout clones and this one, but it just didn't happen. and more than ever, the battle scenes, especially the planet of mustaffar, just seemed like nicely computer generated sets, unlike the original trilogy, which took actual locations and limitations of technology, and made something great with them. well, that's it. the only time one can actually watch these is if you're watching all six star wars films together. but even then, i'd recommend the viewer to just watch nos. 4-6 then 1-3. it just seems better that way. i haven't turned my back on star wars, but this saga is something that has developed, along with my taste for movies. i saw the first movie 10 years ago as a young boy and fell in love with it. i went through a period of not watching many movies, star wars included. now, as a man, who has gotten back into cinema, i have a totally different perspective of the whole thing. over the last few years, i've opted for classic cinema, including old Hollywood and foreign films, the very ones that influenced lucas' creation. they clearly stand head and shoulders above this saga, as they all don't need any flashy special effects to advance a plot. it sounds sad, but that's the thing. star wars has made its mark, and now it is time to move on. all of you.",6,0,1,18 March 2006
