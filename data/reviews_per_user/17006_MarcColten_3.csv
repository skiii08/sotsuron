The Ring," Sorry, no sale (major spoilers)
","Although I am, generally, easily terrified this movie didn't do a thing for me.  My problems:  (1) Why did Watts' sister ask her to look into the death of her daughter whose heart 'just stopped beating' when we learn she looked like she'd been dead a month?  (2)  After they find the kid (which is supposed to exorcise the whole thing) her son says 'You weren't supposed to help her.'  Thanks kid, that's a great time to bring that up.  I hate kids in movies who make things worse when they could be helping.  (3) What were they supposed to do?  Was there a way to stop it? (4) I kind of get the 'making a copy spares you' thing - you're spared if you help the kid.  But why did the son ask what would happen to the person they showed it to?  Who said they have to show it to anyone?Of course they used the old horror film 'out' of alluding to things that, if told, wouldn't work.  Like (a) how did they actually manage to have Satan's child?  (b) If they did all those bad things to her - why did daddy survive? (c) With a whole island to do it in, why did mommy take her daughter all the way to another part of the state to dump her in the well?Sorry, just didn't work for me.",3,1,3,12 October 2003
Se7en," Very disappointing (some spoilers)
","I was very disappointed in this movie.  It's just another serial killer with too much time on his hands, tons of money, the ability to pass through walls and the ability to manipulate time, space and circumstance and no real reason for what he's doing.  I've often wondered about the serial killers in the movies, and this one baffled me.  In a world where you can go places and kill wholesale, this guy spent an entire year to kill one guy?  And how could the detectives be part of the plot?  How could he know who would be assigned or what their circumstances would be?  What if they took an extra three weeks to find his hidden clues?  Wouldn't that throw the whole thing off?  In the scene where they found his apartment and he fired at them and ran away (which was odd since they had no evidence on him) I got the feeling they were chasing the Phantom of the Opera.  As to the ending - I'd take the case any day.  No jury in the world would convict so it meant nothing.  I was expecting a darker ending.",Null,0,1,18 April 2002
Donnie Darko," Excellent mood but not much logic (SPOILERS)
","The film was very moody and offbeat, but had no internal logic.  Donnie is saved by Frank, who tells him to flood the school (which infuriates the school bully), to burn down the motivators house (which exposes his child porn ring), etc etc which leads to Frank's death.  So where is Frank coming from?  Not the future because he's dead (shot in the eye).  Not from the past (he doesn't have the wound he got in the future).  So what does any of it mean? Frank has no motive to save Donnie since it leads to his death. I understand why (if that's what we're being told) that Donnie chooses to go back and die - but only to save his girlfriend.  That could have been accomplished by not doing what Frank said.  BTW - in the 'improved' future - Donnie is dead and the child molestor is not caught.  Not much of an improvement.  And what's with the old lady?  Does her book add anything to the story - and what was the letter Donnie wrote to her?  Was that the letter she was expecting?  Everyone has done time travel and loops from the Twilight Zone, to Star Trek, to Babylon 5, and I think they did it better.I'll give it marks for effort but not for the result.",Null,0,0,18 January 2003
