Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Over-Hyped, Over-rated and done before
","I think the reason people are rating this film so high is that they think it is actually real. Well, it is not. This movie takes many of the ideas from Jackass, The Tom Green Show, Trigger-Happy TV, and every other reality-based shockumentary and tries to put it into legit movie form.Newsflash, this is not real. It is a movie. It was scripted, played out with actors. The plot is fake, the reactions you see people have to Borat are scripted and fake. The whole premise of this movie seems to be to rip on Jews to me. The only reason I gave it a 2, is due to some of the humor is funny, such as in the hotel room, however none of the principles in this movie are real, other than the nudity. This movie is not funnier than Jackass (and thats sad in itself) and contains nothing new that hasn't done before.",2,7,14,11 November 2006
Gravity," Cinematics alone don't make for a stellar movie
","I recently watched this with my fianc√©, due to its high rating we thought we would give it a shot, and I must say this movie, although it does have some cinematic beauty, has an awful storyline, sub-par acting at best, an it is a very boring movie.Clooney and Bullock are pretty vanilla in these roles, just about anyone could have pulled them off. I don't find either one of them turned in a performance that is anywhere near their best work.The story drags on and has very little action, other than spacewalking around and a lot of yelping by Bullock. I can't believe this movie is rated as high as it is, certainly it gains some marks for some beautiful shots, but the story is awful, and please tell me how the Chinese Space station didn't take any damage from the debris the first time around, yet the other space station was blown to bits.3/10 for beauty, mediocre acting, very poor stagnant story.",4,0,2,15 November 2013
Fight Club," Good idea, poor script
","A good idea, and good performance by Norton who is always solid, but this movie just contains too many inconsistencies and impossible acts that don't fit along with the plot.   Not one of Pitt's best performances, but if nothing else, watch it for the performance of Norton and the interesting but flawed storyline.",8,0,2,17 July 2000
Underworld," Compelling, Gripping
","Its been awhile since the latest installment of a vampire/werewolf movie has been attempted at the box office.  This one is surely one of the finest I have seen.  The movie centers around the ongoing war between vampire and lycans (werewolves) and persistent power struggle to terminate the members of the opposite bloodline.  Much unlike the user who reviewed this on the front page, I feel the storyline is very solid.  The main character is played by Kate Beckinsale, who does a very stoic and realistic portrayal of a vampire named Celine who fights to avenge the brutual slaying of her family by the lycans when she was young.    This movie is filled with action and there are VERY FEW moments when something isn't going on.  The mood set by the movie makes the war and its participants very believeable characters if you are able to let your mind free and try to imagine what it would feel like dealing with feelings that have lasted for thousands of years.  This movie is not about bloodsucking and killing of humans (although some humans do die, although more of a result of being caught up in the war) and lycans are more than just being that howl at the moon during a full moon. The storyline is very solid and even contains a few twists which go along with the plot very well.    One of the only flaws of this movie is that most characters are not developed to their potential, then again this movie is not about getting to know a character;s personality and background, etc..   There are a few characters that you dont really know what their role is, but overall this is an excellent movie.     For the type of movie this is, Underworld met and exceeded expectations. The writing is very solid and the special effects are very good.  Beckinsale adds a no-nonsense female role that plays the part well and really gives Carrie Ann Moss a run for her money in leather.  If you can stomach the blood and have an open mind, you should be able to appreciate this movie for what it is-- A top-notch look into the UNDERWORLD!! 9/10",9,0,0,22 September 2003
Pan's Labyrinth," Definitely not your typical Peter Pan of a movie...
","I saw this movie last week with my girlfriend. We are in the mid 20s age bracket and both enjoy thrillers, although I would classify this as more of a film-noireAfter that preface, let me say that I went into this movie with high expectations, having seen the hefty 8.5 score that it was given on this site. Well, the score was perhaps ballooned by the few scenes that are quite dramatic and vivid with the emotions that are going on and the violence. I didn't have any major qualms with the movie, although I surely would have liked to see the background developed more on the whole idea of just what the 'underworld' is comprised of and what the heck the thing in the buffet room was all about.The gripes I DO have with the movie include Mercedes towards the end running into the woods after stabbing the captain SEVERAL times with the knife. She runs for maybe 15 seconds, the guards see her, jump on horses and follow her into the woods, yet she seemingly makes it hundreds of yards into the woods- far enough to be saved by the group of rebels that just happen to spring out when she's about to get captured after being surrounded by the guards.Secondly, the captain himself. After taking a severe stabbing, he is able to meander about the complex, stitch himself up and is seemingly in good health until poisoned by Ofelia. Lastly, I HATED the ending, far too predictable, if you didn't see that coming you should remember the whole 'blood of the innocent' line that the faun tells Ofelia. Definitely not a bad movie, but it could have been so much better if the backgrounds were developed, and the last 2 tasks were a bit more encompassing. The whole ordeal with the 'baby-eater monster' in the buffet hall was cool cinematically, but very poor telling the viewing just what the heck the monster's deal is. 7/10, a solid movie, worth seeing, but somewhat overrated. No super-strong acting performances, all the leads were solid, but no one was knock em dead outstanding.",7,3,7,31 January 2007
Glory," intense
","Glory has a good storyline and flows well.  Good performances by Broderick and Freeman and the supporting actors (col. montgomerie, maj. Forbes) . I believe this was a good account of what black soldiers faced in the civil war. The scenery goes well with the movie and the main characters have good development.  The one thing I did like was the ending of the movie.  It makes no sense for one man to charge ahead and become swiss cheese. Still a solid 7/10",8,1,2,29 July 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Beautiful, well-thought out movie
","I want to keep this short and sweet.  I'll start off by giving credit to Wood as Baggins, McKellan as Gandalf and Mortensen as Aragorn, all three really brought their characters to life and seemed to be what I had in mind as I read the book.   The best part of the movie is probably the scenery and landscapes.  Very beautiful backdrops and imagery bring this film to life.  The Shire seems true to form, as well as Rivendell and my favorite- Lothlorien.   I only have a few gripes. First, being the involvement of Arwen in the movie, compared to the book.  Arwen is not introduced in the book until the council of Elrond, yet she is somehow at Weathertop taking part in the flight of Frodo from the Ringwraiths.  I also have a problem with the fight with the Uruk-Hai, and the events that take place concurrently.   In the book, Merry and Pippen do not meet up with Frodo in the battle by the river before he decides to leave the Fellowship. Also, Aragorn does not come in and slay Boromir's killer, nonetheless the movie does capture much of the book, such as Moria and Brie  ( No Tom Bombadil though )   Its a great movie, surely one to watch as soon as you can.  I wish they would have spent a little more time in the film with Moria, but it was still well done, and no doubt struck the creepiness and fear of the Balrog.   Overall, I'd rate this about a 9.6/10, surely one of the best films I have ever seen, and probably the best film ever done from book to the screen.",10,0,0,20 December 2001
Van Helsing," Meets expectations for the Genre it is targeted at
","In my opinion, Van Helsing is targeted at the X-Men Genre (being teens). While many adults can see the flaws of this movie, I think that many teens are going to really enjoy this one.  The action is non-stop and the computer generated images are pretty solid.  Ok, I agree with some of the comments that the acting is poor, it isnt great, but it is entertaining.   I was able to take my 21 year old girlfriend to this and she didnt complain one time during the movie.  This from a person who likes sappy movies from Legally Blonde to the Rugrats.  Although, not quite as good to me as Underworld, Van Helsing was able to deliver on the action goods as advertised in trailers on TV.  Jackman is decent as VanHelsing and Beckinsale is at least nice to look at.  The girl that play Mishkala ( I think her name is Josie something) was most impressive to me in her limited role- she reeked of evil and seduction.     So why not take your teens to see something that will at least entertain them for 2 hours.  There are a lot worse things they could see or be doing. For my 28 yr old perspective, some of the scenes are a bit unrealistic (see the stage coach scene and some of the parts near the end with beckinsale) but all in all I have to give this one a 7.",7,0,0,7 May 2004
Legends of the Fall," Powerful & Gripping
","As some of the other users, I too had preconceptions of this being just another teenie flick starring Pitt. This movie is much more than most people think..  I like to call it a tri-dimensional love story.  There are three stories going on at once; all of which are powerful. First, you have the relationship between three brothers and their father, which includes everything from sibling rivalry, parental favorites, and the bond between brothers. Next you have Tristan's (Pitt) search to find his soul as I interpret it.  To cease the fire that burns within himself and find his calling. Finally you have a sort of dual-pronged love epic that first involves the youngest brother Samuel, then moves to a rather interesting tale between Susanne, Alfred and Tristan.  There are some intersting but predictable turns in the plot, but it is all very powerful stuff. Topped off with a fairly good ending, this movie will cause watery eyes and sniffles, so tag along a box of kleenex, especially if your girlfriend is with ya :)    Super performances by Pitt and Ormond. 9 out of 10",9,4,7,19 July 2000
Million Dollar Baby," One dollar ending
","This movie is great, if not spectacular in the first half, only to be very slow and predictable in the second-half. I think where this movie makes it points (and thus the high rating) is from the acting performances by Eastwood and Swank who are solid. Swank does an excellent job in her portrayal of a boxer in her early 30s, who Eastwood takes on as a student. I have to mention what I didn't like about the movie, enough people told you about the good points by now.First off, there is no development of the characters Danger and Swaraylle (whatever the heck his name is, the black dude that freeman knocks out) they don't really serve a purpose other than comedic relief. The whole fight with Billie the Bear at the end is reeeediculous. OK, obviously they know she's a dirty fighter, they would have studied her at length before the fight.. So why the heck does Maggie turn her back on her, and even worse, WHERE IS THE REF?? At the very least, Billie The Bear would have been disqualified and fined, if not suspended by the WBF boxing commission. And the ending is too similar to what happened when Frankie was 'sub' manager for Scrap. They needed to come up with something else, its too darn predictable. The last hour of the movie is just unduely depressing.. They needed to take a different turn on the ending. Anyway, its right there with Butterfly Effect- great first half, lousy ending 5/10",6,0,2,9 November 2005
Downfall," solid
","this is a pretty solid film revolving around Hitler's last days. The is some pretty decent character development of some of the generals surrounding Hitler (no Rommel though :( ) and gives a good sense of the urgency that Hitler may have felt when Berlin was falling. Great performance by Granz as Hitler and the guy that played Goebbels also did a solid job. A pretty long movie, but if you are into WW2 history, it is very solid and worth watching, lots of scenes of gripping tension between Hitler and his Generals and it is nice to see someone interviewed that was actually there at the time (hitler's secretary, which the film opens up with). Good flick 8/10",8,1,3,18 October 2010
Signs," Ho-Hum ripoff of Independence Day meets Children of the Corn
","I expected a lot more from this movie then what I got.  You have a very weak ending to a cliche plot that is marred with the usual (let me stand in the living room and let the aliens break-in mentality)  Gibson fans will also be let down by what I feel is his worse acting job of his career. Gibson once again plays the guardian of a household (yes another Braveheart, The Patriot, role) in which his strong ideals and moral glue hold the family together through 'tough times' Without giving much away, don't expect any wonderful visual effects, or any deep thinking characters in this stroy.. There are many similarities to Independence Day and Children of the Corn, I counted at least 3 from ID and 2 from COC.  The reason I give this movie a 6 is the way the suspense flows well without having to constantly see an alien.. But the ending is a letdown and there are some flaws..  ** minor spoiler** - The Aliens can read minds  ( the end of the movie does not reflect this, ex- swing away.. - No one in their right mind isnt going to get some kind of weapon to fight the aliens off.. Instead you have both adults standing there waiting for the aliens to enter the house.. gimme a break! -  Asthma inhaler.. Ok if your kid has asthma, isnt this a top priority item?/ Instead lets just leave it upstairs so he can have an asthma attack.  Ok there are more, but I dont want to talk myself into giving this a 5.  You might as well watch it and see for yourself.. Girls that like to be a little scared but not have nightmares will like this movie more than guys in my opinion. 6/10",6,0,1,9 August 2002
The Ringer," Ring around the collar
","This was a terrible movie. Firstly, the plot is inane and a stretch. Knoxville agrees to throw the special olympics in order to raise money to pay for an operation to sew a friends fingers back on after a lawn mowing accident. Severed fingers lasting 2 weeks on ice? I don't think so.The acting in this movie is downright awful. The only decent performance comes from Jed, who played Glen, who did a decent job. The rest of the acting was so bad that they were outdone by the unexperience 'challanged/special' performers. Knoxville's character is not nearly as funny as you would think and the script is anything that a 13 yr old could draw up with his friends (albeit not as funny most likely). I really expected more from the production companies that did happy gilmore, but this was downright awful, and the last 30 minutes really want to make one puke, not to mention the plethora of plot holes. I give this a 3, mainly for the acting of the special guys and Jed.",3,1,6,24 December 2005
The Sixth Sense," Solid plot with great ending, but...
","This film contains a great combination of horror, mystery, drama, and sci-fi all conglomerated into the same film.  The premise of the story is that a young child played by Osment is able to see dead people as easy as you or I can see the living.  What do these 'dead people' want of him??  Dr Malcolm Crowe ( played by willis) offers his help to unlock the mystery.  **** Do not read this next paragraph if you don't want to learn of the ending**** Ok, this is a great film, no doubt about that.  The ending is one of the best as well.. But I bring attention to the fact that if Crowe is suppose to be dead all along yet HE DOESN'T KNOW HE IS DEAD, why don't we see crowe trying to interact with the living?????? He is suppose to be 'alive' yet wouldn't it seem a bit out of the ordinary if your wife never talks to you?? OR in the case of when he went to see Cole at his house, he is sitting with cole's mom--- wouldn't it seem feasible to want to strike up a discussing with the mother of a boy whom you are trying to solve his 'mental problems'???     I just find it hard to believe that a man would not try to communicate with anyone throughout the duration of the time he is examining Cole, beacause he is DEAD so therefore if he did, he would surely realize something is wrong, why would everyone ignore him? hmm     This is about the only point of the movie that keeps it from a 10 for me.  The plot is well-developed, and Willis does a good job portraying Crowe.   Osment is the real star of this movie though.  The kid puts on one heck of a performance!  You believe his pain, his fear, and want to see his problems resolved.   Also, I would have liked to see Cole help the ghosts in his house ( the wife and the kid with the bullet wound) and maybe tell the audience a little more about the backgrounds of the ghosts to add more of an eerie twist. But a solid movie nonetheless  8 out of 10 p.s. if you like this movie watch Jacob's Ladder, another psychological thriller with a litter darker theme",8,0,0,5 July 2000
Cube," A good idea, but...
","This is a weird one, but worth the $2 to see it.  You have an interesting idea of placing different individuals from all walks of like together in what turns out to be a type of Human-Rat Maze.What keeps this movie from being a 9 or a 10 is that the movie never really opens up on the fact of why the people that are in the movie were chosen, and how they got there.This movie will keep your interest until about 3/4 of the way through, when it starts to drag and the plot corrodes away to your basic 'bad guy'. 
If you like Sci-fi, film-noire types, give this one a look, its surely worth spending a couple bucks.6.8/10",8,4,5,23 June 2000
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Aa third dimension to vampire films - contains possible Spoiler
","This movie has something that all the stereotypical vamp films like From Dusk Till Dawn and Fright Night lack:  A sense of substinence of what life as a vampire may be more actually like if they were to be real...Louis ( Pitt) loses a recent bride and child and wants nothing more than to end his life.  Lestat (Cruise) decides to give him the choice to be a vampire.  Of course Louis accepts and begins his descent into the immortal but hellish life of a vampire.Most of the movie deals with the lifestyles of 3 vampires, including Claudia (By Dunst) and what it is like to be one (in the view of Rice's eyes).   This is much more than your seduce and suck flick.  There are feelings here between Louis and humankind, Lestat and Claudia.Check this one out if you are looking for an interesting, unique vampire movie.*** Possible Spoiler Below***The big flaw I see in this movie is that after the Death of Lestat, he is able to come back to life by supposedly eating alligators, snakes, lizards, etc.. but he was clearly dead so I really don't see how he could have.Also, later when Lestat returns for vengence upon Claudia, he seems to look rather rough ( from the blood of reptiles)  yet after his is burned and Louis and Claudia leave him, some 80 years or so pass and the next time we see lestat he is in his same state.   If he is alive and feeding for 80 years, would he not return to his regular form???  He chomps on Slater at the end and turns back to the ol Lestat after just one victim.. Doesn't make sense8 out of 10",8,1,2,12 July 2000
Her," snore fest
","This movie is very slow moving and has about as much action as a sloth in the afternoon. The principle of the movie is decent, but the execution is horrible and by the end of the film, if you hear Scarlet Johanssen's fake forced laugh anymore you want to hurl.There are so many stretches in physics that would have to happen to make this movie plausible that to me, it is more of a comedy than anything else. The implication that an operating system could write and update it's own code is a farce enough, but to give it a full range of human emotions and understanding of those emotions, especially right out of the box is as believable as Kindergarteners coming up with a cure for cancer.Phoenix does a decent job, but by the end of the movie, you kinda want him to go away or perish horribly. They would have been better off to cast Jim Carrey as Theodore.3/10",3,8,14,18 May 2014
