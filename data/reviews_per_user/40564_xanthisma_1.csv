It," A real horror movie
","I was never very impressed with the 1990 version of IT. While Tim Curry's Pennywise was creepy in his own way, he was never true nightmare material. This version is much scarier and more violent - a true horror movie. I jumped several times and had to turn away from the screen in a couple of places, and I am not easily scared (or so I tell myself). There were several bits of comic relief scattered in, even in the middle of really tense parts of the movie, so that your adrenaline wasn't engaged the ENTIRE time. The acting was phenomenal and believable for the most part, although a little over the top in a couple places with a couple of the kids, which is the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10. Otherwise, if you want to get the pants scared off of you, go see this movie!",9,15,36,6 September 2017
