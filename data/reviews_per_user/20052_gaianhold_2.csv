The Legend of Bagger Vance," Well worth the time to see
","I had heard  mixed reviews of this movie but being a duffer myself and because I like both Matt Damon and Will Smith, it seemed worth giving it a try and I'm glad I did. The plot was not as predictable as it might have been,in fact, it was quite poignant.  And, without giving away any plot details, there is great value in seeing this last movie performance of Jack Lemmon.",8,0,1,12 July 2001
Remember the Titans," Glad you decided to do another reality based story, Denzel
","After the movie about the fighter that Denzel Washington has recently starred in (and I'm ashamed to say I don't remember the name), I heard an interview wherein Denzel Washington said that he wasn't all that interested in doing another story based on a real life as his next movie.  And I can understand his concern, there is such a thing as type-casting.  But I, for one, am very glad that he changed his mind.  I'll see a Denzel Washington movie any day, but what his name brought me into this time was a story I might not otherwise not have been all that interested in.  I have to be in the mood to get into a sports movie - they can be very hackkneed - a good reason why I haven't seen the movie about that boxer.  I admit I might have been interested in a movie about a coach after Mike Krzyzewski proved himself so well this year (yes, I'm a Duke fan) and knowing that he's a great person with his players and in general. Still, I probably would have passed if not for Washington.  At any rate, this wasn't a movie just about a coach, even one that we should be proud of - it was also the story of his players.  It was just plain moving and we can thank Denzel Washington's fame for bringing it to the fore.",9,0,0,12 July 2001
