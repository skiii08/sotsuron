The Expendables 2," The best action movie I've seen in years.
","People who feared the fact that EXPENDABLES 2 would be PG-13 need not worry, the film is actually rated-R for enough action and testosterone to satisfy even the most hard to please action fanatic, from the first frame there's a whole lot of action served up in one large dose, it reminded me of when I first saw John Woo's HARD BOILED, I thought if a film starts off with this much action at the beginning, what kind of action can we expect towards the end? Believe me this film does not disappoint, there is action throughout and like I said it comes in large doses each time.There is also lots of humor, I found myself laughing at every joke and one liner that came out even Chuck Norris got the chance to tell one of his own jokes and it also shows that a smart car can be deadly in the hands of both Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.Plot wise the film is a whole lot better, there's better character development and the whole set of characters also start to grow on you after a while and Jean-Claude Van Damme is excellent as the villain as well as Scott Adkins who plays Van Damme's right hand man.Overall, action fans who have grown tired of the overly dramatic snooze fest that pass for action films these days should enjoy this action masterpiece immensely.The first film on IMDb I give 10 out of 10.",10,2,9,19 August 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Better than average game to film adaptation.
","The latest game to get the movie treatment, PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is probably one of the better game to film adaptations today and this is not about how it compares to the game, the game is a very action packed and very energetic game play experience, the film stays close to the story but what it does best is capture that same energetic feeling the game has.The characters are well cast and great performances are given all around and the extra dash of humor makes it that much more entertaining, as a film its a great action adventure story, compared to the game you'll find a few things done differently but that doesn't keep it from being a good film in the end.Also you can take comfort in knowing that Uwe Boll didn't get the chance to sink his teeth into this one but I would recommend he watch this to see what happens when you do a good job at making a movie, it might not be a bad idea he could take notes and actually learn something.",8,8,16,26 May 2010
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Good as an action film, not so good as a character story
","This film was not as much of character story as I thought it would be but it certainly wasn't a bad film, if seen as an action film its very entertaining, the action sequences feature big budget effects that for a change wasn't overdone, the effects added to the action without trying to be an overly spectacular visual effects feast which was actually really refreshing.The character story is not as deep or complex as I expected, everything was kept very simple such as where the film portrays Wolverine and Sabertooth as brothers but it doesn't really broaden out the relationship and the back story of wolverine is only about events that happen to him and doesn't really expand on the character story.However, this was good as an action film but disappointing for not really being much of a character story, I recommend it mainly for its entertainment value.",7,2,4,29 September 2009
The Expendables," It delivers all the goods of an all out action film.
","If you're looking for a complex plot or intelligent dialog or deep character development then you're barking up the wrong tree, if want a movie that delivers on its promise of insane gun fights, fist fights, knife fights, explosions and flying bodies then this most certainly is the film for you.At first I thought with the majority of the big name action stars all brought together for the first time, what could I expect from such a film? When I finally saw the film what I got was a film that was more action driven then plot driven, the pace was rather fast, it quickly sets up the plot, it keeps the character development simple and you don't need to put on you're thinking cap because the plot doesn't even try to be complex, it sets out to be a straight ahead all out action movie.The action scenes are insane to put it simple, they're all fast paced and really violent and just what the doctor would prescribe to any action fan.Overall, as an action film it doesn't disappoint, viewed as something else it obviously will and of course this is the third time that Jason Statham and Jet Li appeared in a film together, they previously appeared together in THE ONE and WAR, and this is the second film that Steve Austin and Terry Crews have appeared in together, they previously appeared together in THE LONGEST YARD and here's one that's not in the trivia section, this is the second film that DOLPH LUNDGREN and GARY DANIELS have appeared in together, they previously appeared together in a Sci-Fi movie called RETROGRADE.",8,2,4,15 October 2010
Pacific Rim," A film slightly better than what I expected
","Before watching PACIFIC RIM I noticed it had a lot of critics really hammered down on it and truth be told it really wasn't that bad. Then again I stopped listening to critics a long time ago. Although many would agree it could be somewhat overblown with special effects but it did have a decent plot. The acting wasn't the best but also not the worst. All the effects were very nicely done and the fight sequences were very engaging partly because the film established what was at stake before them.All in all, PACIFIC RIM isn't as bad as critics say it is in fact I think they might have been too harsh. The best way to see PACIFIC RIM is probably without expecting to much and to judge for yourself if you like it or not. For me it was good and better than expected and I would recommend it as a better alternative to a lot of other films out there.",7,9,13,29 November 2013
The Thing," Back to the days of early 80's monster horror.
","With all the fancy technology of today that are used to create all the special creature effects there are only a few films in my opinion that really have some cool special effects and the best part is all of them came out in the 80's, before the days of overused CGI.The films that stand out are A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, Clive Barker's HELLRAISER, Clive Barker's NIGHT BREED and John Carpenter's THE THING, now THE THING is the only one out of the bunch where I actually get grossed out when I looked at the creature effects, I mean as I'm writing this review this film is 29 years old and I've watched it again recently and the effects still gross me out, that's how well this film is made, put it back in the cinemas and it'll wipe the floor with every other new horror movie out there.The acting is outstanding, many of today's actors will struggle to match this caliber of performances and the plot is simple, very well paced and does a great job of creating a high sense of paranoia.Overall, its a classic worth revisiting.",8,1,2,2 August 2011
Tropic Thunder," This is a truly good comedy.
","With all negativity aside, I thought this was truly a good comedy, sure it was crude and offensive, but its not the first and definitely won't be the last, and I'll let in on a little secret, you get people complaining that this movie is offensive because it uses the word retard a lot for example, now take those very same people put them in a bar, give them enough booze, and then observe at how many times they use a few words over and over, my point is people sometime just look for an excuse to be full of it.The movie itself is funny as hell, and boast a lot of likable characters like Kirk Lazurus (Robert Downey Jr.), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and the dweeb of a director who fancies himself Oliver Stone (Steve Coogan), Just naming a few, and for Ben Stiller a guy I figured I don't like for some reason I can't place my finger on, did a great job as director, and Tom Cruise, this is probably the first time I've seen him change his appearance, I think, because every film I saw him in that I can remember, he pretty much looked the same, this time he actually has a bold head.Overall, go see this movie, and if you don't like it for some reason then too bad, just move on and find something else.",8,1,2,13 February 2009
District 9," A very unique Sci-Fi movie.
","What I expected from DISTRICT 9 was miles off, the film painted an interesting picture of aliens that have not invaded the U.S as you might expect but have invaded the city of Johannesburg in South Africa and have taken refuge in the city's slums.The film was different in terms of the setting, where instead of another major American city we have the capital of South Africa, where you get a completely different culture of people that are your typical South African and that along with the setting is what sets this film way apart from other Sci-Fi films.Being a resident of South Africa myself and I'm also familiar with a lot of South African films and actors, I have never seen any of the actors in this film before but they give stellar performances throughout.However, I have spoken to people that didn't like this film and I've spoken to people that did like it, which almost makes it difficult for me to recommend to others, I did like the film of course but my expectations were different, but overall I thought the direction was great the story was also great as well as the acting and the action scenes were thoroughly entertaining but if I was to recommend it I would say lower your expectations because this is the kind of film that will get mixed reactions, so it will be best to watch it with an open mind.",7,4,6,11 January 2010
Insidious," The first film in a long time that made me jump.
","I've seen a lot of horror films and many of them made jump almost out of my seat, most of them being well known classics and a few of them were not so well known, the last horror film to make me jump was before seeing INSIDIOUS was called WHISPER, I saw it three years ago.INSIDIOUS was a huge surprise for me, I just rented it at the rental shop and went to watch it without even checking whether it was R-rated or PG13 because I didn't really care at the time, however its not a gore fest or one of those annoying teen horror movies, its actually a really good scary haunted house horror, very well acted by the cast with Lin Shaye playing one of the most memorable characters in the film, brilliantly directed by James Wan and the script provided by Leigh Whannell makes a big effort to dodge all the obvious and annoying genre clichés.Overall, horror fans ought to be pleased with this film as it delivers enough scares and never really resorts to cheap thrills and to be honest after I watched the film I thought it was probably R-rated so to find out it was actually PG13 came as a surprise as I figured it could've been too intense for a low rating.",8,0,0,8 March 2012
I Am Legend," pretty much an empty shell
","I am Legend tells the story of Robert Neville (Will Smith) the last known survivor of a deadly plague that was created by a cancer cure that ended up killing of the world's population and turning a small portion of it into light phobic man eating zombies.It has ups and downs like a lot of films these days, Will Smith plays his role very convincingly, and an empty New York makes for an ideal setting and tone for the film.The down part about it is the second half and the cgi, the zombies (or whatever you want to call them) are completely done with cgi, which ended up looking rather silly than scary, the cgi was actually very pointless, using live actors with make up effects would have created more realistic creatures instead of the cartoon like zombies you get, and the second half of the story strayed a lot from character development to a pointless storyline that becomes very uninteresting, the very few action scenes in the film did very little to generate much excitement at all.I have not read the original book by Richard Matheson or seen the other two film adaptations but this film, aside from the performance by Will Smith and having the ideal setting and tone, is really nothing to be overly excited about, its pretty much an empty shell.",6,1,2,5 May 2008
The Hurt Locker," I finally saw THE HURT LOCKER and it wasn't that great.
","A congratulations to Kathryn Bigelow for being the first lady film director to win an Oscar for best director, although after I saw HURT LOCKER after waiting so long for it, I was surprised to discover that someone like me who doesn't know a lot about the military could actually notice something off about the way the army guys in this film operate and this is just my take I'm not a military expert.1. In the very first scene after the guy that disarms the bombs suits up and starts walking away, his team stays behind to cover him but at one point this guy is so far away from his team you don't see anyone covering him from anywhere and you can clearly see Arabs in close enough proximity to take the bomb guy out with a pistol.2. The scene where our lead character who replaces the bomb guy who was killed in the explosion before almost gets hit by a car is clearly an incident that could've been avoided, because you could see the car clearly speeding down the road and the soldiers who were there didn't even try to stop it because they just popped out after the car drove past even though they had enough time to react when the car came down the road, so our bomb guy is pretty much an open target every time he leaves he's team because all the soldiers are slow, lucky for him having a gun.3. The sniper scene everyone talks about, the fact that bomb experts suddenly became trained snipers was actually a load of bull, I didn't buy that for a second because I know that snipers and bomb experts are given different training.After all that the film was an absolute snooze fest, the plot didn't really go anywhere it just floated around and made 2 hours feel like 2 years, the only good things were the explosions and the acting was okay but for something that got the best picture award it was really not that good and is severely over hyped, it also doesn't hold a candle to your classic war films.With all due respect to Kathryn Bigelow, I thought that NEAR DARK, POINT BREAK and STRANGE DAYS were all good films but this one honestly wasn't.",4,2,4,5 January 2011
Clash of the Titans," Worth seeing as an action adventure, nothing more.
","This film may not be completely accurate when it comes to Greek mythology but this film does deliver if you want an enjoyable epic action adventure with better than average CG effects and action scenes that are fun to watch.The storyline is pretty straight forward, it has a reasonable amount of character development as well as great performances from the leading and supporting cast, the direction by Louis Leterrier (THE INCREDIBLE HULK & TRANSPORTER 2) is not completely rock solid but it is well done nonetheless.Overall, to me this was fun as an action adventure but if you're looking for something that is accurate in terms of Greek mythology this is not the film for you, also I only saw the 2D version so my opinion about this film's effects might differ a bit from others.",7,1,1,31 July 2010
The Dark Knight," You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
","I've never really been a die hard Batman fan, but one day my brother rented Batman Begins and I sat down and watched it since there was nothing better to do, during the course of the film I was intrigued by the deep character story and thought the film had a pretty cool build up that made the action scenes much more effective, so I can say I actually enjoyed it.The Dark Knight however, I went out the extra mile and actually bought it, and can safely say that I don't regret it, not one bit, the characters in this film were far more interesting and the cast did a formidable job, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the joker was for this film what Johnny Depp's portrayal of Jack Sparrow was for Pirates of the Caribbean, no one could have done it better, I'll also give similar props to Aaron Eckhart, who does an excellent playing Harvey Dent, his best bit of acting is when he makes the transition from Gotham's white knight to dangerous villain Harvey two face, I also like the fact that brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan incorporated a lot of irony and symbolism in to the story, for instance, Harvey is considered by Batman to be the symbol of hope hence symbolism, and later on after Harvey is seriously burned after an explosion, he then after realizing he's lost everything, sets of on a vengeful rampage and then becomes the villain two face, hence the quote earlier in the film made by Harvey himself, 'You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain' representing irony, and the way Alfred (Micheal Caine) was telling Bruce Wayne (Christain Bale) about how some people just want to watch the world burn, that could easily describe a real life terrorist if you give it some thought.Together with a great script from Jonathan and brother Christopher Nolan, and with a big cast that bring the characters to life, The Dark Knight stands out as 2008's film of the year, and Rest in peace Heath Ledger, the movie world won't be the same without you.",8,3,7,3 March 2009
Taken," Liam Neeson could give Steven Seagal a few acting tips.
","Once two American girls are kidnapped in France, a retired government agent and father of one of the kidnapped girls sets out to try and find them, wreaking havoc and taking care of anyone who tries to stop him.Taken is a fast paced action thriller that probably offers nothing new, but in very few of these action films do you get a lead actor that can portray a character that you actually end up cheering for, Liam Neeson plays the role of a man on a mission to rescue his daughter to perfection, he's intense and you can tell by the way he looks at a lot of the other characters that he'll ring their necks in a split second if they so much as look at him the wrong way, unlike other action stars like Steven Seagal for one, who is always so calm and collected and doesn't show the type of desperation of a man determined to find his daughter (watch Belly of the Beast if you want to know what I'm talking about) and whose characters are actually very uninteresting because he plays them exactly the same every time, I'd reckon that Liam Neeson could give Seagal a few acting tips and kick his ass with little effort.All in all, a good fast paced action thriller that delivers the goods, and is also carried with ease by Liam Neeson's excellent performance in the lead role.",8,1,2,25 February 2009
Avatar," A visual effects feast that is really a feast
","James Cameron returns to the director's chair to bring us AVATAR that rises above being just another special effects feast that just sets to show off its big budget and groundbreaking CGI, the difference between AVATAR and many other big budget effects films is that here the effects work in service to the story and showcasing a splendid vision of what Pandora really is, a mystical land of both beauty and danger and lifeforms never seen before.The storyline and performances are beyond reproach and the direction, well its James Cameron the guy brought us ALIENS, TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS, and TITANIC, could it be anything less than great? Overall, its a visual effects feast that is really a feast and must be seen to be truly appreciated.",9,8,17,20 December 2009
30 Days of Night," Good horror movie with good acting, just a bit slow
","30 Days of night was actually an OK film in my own opinion, the only flaw I found in it was that it felt a little long, the action scenes had a few moments, but the storyline seemed to fall flat in terms of new ideas, the vampires were definitely presented in a different way, but the overall storyline is just about a handful of people trying to survive 30 days of night being hunted by vampires, and thats pretty much it, no major character development and no complicated story that draws you in, its just straight forward and simple.I do disagree with reviews stating that the film had two weak leads, Josh Hartnett and Melissa Goerge's performances may not have carried the film but they did give good performances, considering I've always thought you can't really judge the acting in this type of film or any other horror film, because there are some good horror movies with relatively bad acting, and bad horror movies with actors you don't ever want to see again.Overall, good horror movie with good acting, just a bit slow.",6,0,2,15 March 2008
Centurion," A worth addition to its genre.
","I'm not going to add a plot synopsis, I hardly ever do so I'll cut to the review, CENTURION is an action adventure that combines great story telling with battle sequences that will give BRAVEHEART a run for its money, the performances by the cast are all excellent mainly because each actor fits his or part perfectly, you don't see that to often.With all that said this film doesn't fall into the same league as GLADIATOR or 300, but any fan of the genre would do well to see this, as you can tell straight from the start, its not aiming for any type of award, its aim is to just be a good movie but if you need further motivation to see this, its also directed by Neil Marshall whose credits include DOG SOLDIERS, THE DESCENT and DOOMSDAY.",7,3,7,10 December 2010
The Conjuring," A rare horror movie that earns its R-rated stripes on scares alone.
","In a time where horror movies are truly not so good anymore comes THE CONJURING. The first horror film in years that I could call a classic. It's also maybe a rare find, by that I mean it has to be the only R-rated movie that has the lowest body count as well as no sex, no gore and no swearing. It also thankfully doesn't fall into the annoying teen horror category. It features a group of characters you do start to care and feel for.Final Verdict, I have to give credit to James Wan and everyone involved,They've created a movie with a very dark and edgy atmosphere and for a horror film to be able to earn its R-rated stripes on scares alone is certainly a show of great film making talent. If you are looking for a true horror gem in a sea of many turds, THE CONJURING is without a doubt a film I can highly recommend.",9,1,1,9 June 2014
The Dark Knight Rises," A brilliant conclusion to Nolan's Batman trilogy.
","Christopher Nolan caps off his Batman trilogy with a brilliant third installment, although I have to mention I had to be in a mood to watch this film as it took a while to really get the main plot going. Don't get me wrong this film is brilliant, I loved it but it could've been trimmed in some areas as the film tended to be really slow at some points.The action scenes themselves were very well done and the acting was great all around. The actors who stand out the most are Micheal Cain who brings more to his character this time around and Tom Hardy whose performance makes Bane a great villain. Along with Anne Hathaway who is much better and sexier as Catwoman than Halle Berry.Overall. this final installment is brilliant even though it could've been a bit shorter.",7,0,6,2 January 2013
Pineapple Express," Its not a comedy classic, but its not that bad either
","Dale Denton witnesses a man he is supposed to serve with a court order murder another man and goes on the run with his drug dealer buddy Saul Silver.PINEAPPLE EXPRESS clearly won't go down in history as a comedy classic, even though I barely laughed it wasn't really a terrible film, it was sort fun to watch and the characters of Dale (Seth Rogen, KNOCKED UP) and Saul (James Franco, SPIDERMAN) I found rather likable, even that odd ball Red (Danny McBride, TROPIC THUNDER) was okay, my brother thought of it as one of those 'its so bad its good' films but for me personally, it wasn't really very funny but its also not a bad movie and you wouldn't waste your time by watching it, so whether your wondering if you want to watch it or not, I'd say watch it by all means, but if you ask me to recommend something, this wouldn't be my first choice.5 out of 10",5,2,6,19 February 2009
