Source Code," Terrific
","This is this years best sci/fi movie and one of this years best movies overall. The plot is completely believable, the Source Code that is. It is where a person is implanted into the thoughts of an already dead person for the last 8 minutes of their life in order to find out something of critical importance. In this case, it is to find an explosives expert who bombed a train killing everyone on board before they bomb another area in the epicenter of Chicago where millions of people reside.Jake Gyllenhaal is terrific as Capt. Colter Stevens, who's the man inside the Source Code trying to figure out who the killer is before he kills again. Michelle Monaghan is lovable as her character plays the 'love interest' in a way of Gyllenhaal. The rest of the cast is terrific as well as they all come together to make this story as believable as possible.Twists and turns throughout make you guess what could possibly happen next and most of the time, you guess wrong. Like who is the killer, where is the Source Code located, and is this even a legal or ethical process. The last one being a judgment call where the majority of movie watchers come to a one sided agreement.The only reason for the 9/10 instead of the 10/10 is because I didn't care for the ending. What transpired for me wasn't believable at all and kind-of deflated the process the movie took from believable sci/fi to fantasy. Usually I would drop a score tremendously for this but the rest of the movie was just too good to do it. Others loved the ending and you may as well.Give it a go and make the decision for yourself.",9,0,2,15 August 2011
Bridesmaids," Expected Many Laughs and Received None.
","Cast with possibly the two funniest actresses in the business today (Kristen Wiig and Rose Byrne)I expected nothing less than 'The Hangover' if not better with this all female cast. What I received was a flurry of burp, fart, vomit, diarrhea and semen jokes with no originality involved whatsoever which, most importantly, produced no laughs.Instead of laughing along with Wiig's character as the movie progresses, you undeniably can't. Almost everything she says just makes you cringe with awkwardness and sometimes even disgust as you eventually wonder if you're missing something funny that was just said or done. You didn't.If you're expecting to laugh as much as 'The Hangover' get ready to be sorely disappointed.",2,12,23,4 July 2011
Fast Five," Fast 5 Certainly is Fast
","With the exception of Paul Walker's (as usual) terrible acting, Fast 5 has everything an action movie strives for; believable acting, humor (mostly from Tyrese), explosions, sexy women (and men for the ladies out there), exotic cars, destruction, and most importantly, full-throttled action that its predecessors couldn't come close to matching.The setting in Rio really showcases how beautiful the city is with spectacular aerial views thrown in on occasion to highlight it. Fast 5 is definitely the best of the Fast and Furious franchise, and it really isn't even close.",9,2,3,5 July 2011
