Hereditary," Good movie EXCEPT for the last 10 minutes
","It's hard to rate this movie. The movie runs for 2 hours. The first 1 hour and 50 minutes was really good, I mean, REALLY good. About an hour in, I thought to myself, this is a really good movie, something really different than what we're used to, a horror movie that is not just about scaring its viewers. Good acting by Toni Collette, nice cinematography, good writing and directing, good buildup, unconventional scares, no jump scares at all. Because of that, I was hoping for the ending to be different, to match the buildup and setup it prepares the viewers. But I was let down.The last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie shows us nothing original, nothing you have never seen before in many horror movies. This kind of ending has been done to death for decades, I was sorely disappointed. The little 'twist' in the final moment seemed like something the writer had to come up with to make up for the weak third act.This movie reminds me of House of The Devil, another slow burner type of horror movie which was really, really good until they ruined it in the third act. What can I say, I guess coming up with a strong ending is really hard, especially for horror movies. Maybe that's why most prefer to play it safe and keep horror movies simple. Maybe 'simple' works better for horror movies anyway.",6,0,1,3 November 2018
BlacKkKlansman," A movie you have to like to not be called a racist?
","I'm not white or black, and I'm not American. I guess this allows me to see the film in a very neutral, unbiased perspective, and to judge it based on its own merits rather than the political issues surrounding it.When I watched the trailer, my impression was that the movie was going to be hilarious, probably a subtle, lighter take on a heavy subject, with a strong ending that sends the right message to the audience. That was my expectation of the movie. Since it also ended up as a nominee for Best Picture at the Oscar, I expected a really good, solid movie that deals with the subject of racism in a unique, creative way. Instead, what I got was a dragging movie full of cliches, uninspired dialogues, and in-your-face message before the credits rolled.I was left underwhelmed and very disappointed. Not only that the movie was such a drag, I didn't like how one-sided and stereotypical it was. I think the reason this is so highly rated is because people are so afraid of being labeled 'racist' for not liking the movie. That, and the political views that it projects, some people want their views to be validated. Pardon me, I'm a person of color and I didn't enjoy the movie.",5,25,45,1 March 2019
Bird Box," Why do some people want everything to be 'explained' to them all the time?
","How have human beings become this dumb? Seems like in this day and age, you can't make movies that don't show and explain everything anymore. People don't even trust their own imaginations/assumptions, or people just don't have imaginations anymore. One reviewer said 'If I wanted to imagine my own ending I'd just imagine the entire story!' except that he can't. You can't even use your brain to imagine an ending to a ridiculously simple movie, how can you imagine the entire story? Now, the movie itself, to me, was nothing to write home about. It's a post-apocalypse movie, post-apocalypse movies are like zombie movies, they are not to be taken seriously. They usually don't have sensible plot, they exist just for the sole purpose of entertainment (other than to make money of course), not awards season, and one viewing is enough. Just ignore the hype around this movie. Don't expect anything groundbreaking or original. Yes, some characters did do stupid things like characters in post-apocalypse/zombie/horror movies always do, but it's tolerable. If you can sit back and enjoy it for what it is, you might as well be entertained. I think if you watch it with this mindset you won't be disappointed UNLESS you are the type who want everything to be shown and explained to you all the time. In that case, no, you won't get an answer to where the young couple who ran away with the car ended up in, or whether they made it alive or not.",6,2,5,16 January 2020
Toy Story 4," I did not recognize THIS Buzz Lightyear at all!
","Toy Story 1,2, and 3 were great, probably better than great, they were all connected and solid. They had all the Pixar signatures in them: great animations, good character development, original script, character realism, animation realism, funny, and all around fun. But this.... this feels like a different movie than the other Toy Story franchise. I did not recognize the Buzz Lightyear in this movie AT ALL. Who is this Buzz? Buzz used to be very confident, he was second in command after Woody. Sure he was a delusional 'space ranger' when Andy first got him, but after all of that confusion was over, he became confident and calm. In Toy Story 4 he suddenly became as dumb as a rock. I thought that was Rex's personality? Maybe they got the characters mixed up, heaven knows. Even Rex now seems smarter than Buzz.And at times this feels more like a Disney movie rather than a Pixar movie. The animations of human characters in Toy Story 4 looked like animations of human characters in Frozen, they lacked realism at times. For example, when Bonnie woke up one morning, she did not act like how a child (or any human being) would act waking up and her hair clip was still nicely clipping her hair. Pixar used to care about all little details like this in all their previous films, which made them so great. So this is more like one step down for a Pixar film.And the story..... while I do feel that the premise is promising (Woody finding greater meaning of being a toy), the craft of the story is pretty weak. However, having said that, the ending was still pretty satisfying. Maybe that was the only thing that actually saved the movie. Though I would prefer a better exchange between Woody and Buzz at the end, I mean, they were best friends for a long time and they were not going to see each other ever again, I expected an exchange that would satisfy long time Toy Story fans, something to be remembered for a long time.",6,4,5,18 November 2019
A Quiet Place," This movie needs to be parodied asap!
","Let me start by saying that this movie is only for people with low IQ. It may sound harsh, but it's the truth. Suspension of disbelief could go so far until you realized you couldn't suspend your disbelief anymore. The movie is just trying to insult your intelligence. If there is another installment of the Scary Movie franchise, this movie should be high on the list to be parodied, I think the parody will be really funny, I could think of tons of ideas for a parody.The only reason I didn't give this movie 1 star is because I've seen much worse horror movies with similar theme in recent years (like Hush, oh boy..). Do NOT believe the high ratings and the glowing reviews, they're mostly fake and probably written by people involved in the movie. I was duped by those reviews, many others were duped by those reviews, don't let yourself be duped too!",2,0,2,14 August 2018
