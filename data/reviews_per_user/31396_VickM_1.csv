Black Swan," Good, but not enough to be 'great'
","OK, I can accept the fact that this had excellent acting and an excellent score, but why in the world is it on IMDb's top 250 # 48? Natalie Portman deserves the Oscar for her nearly perfect performance as the disturbed ballet dancer. I really thought it was even frightening to see her self-destruction for the 2 hours of the film, but I don't think this film should be in the position that it is in this moment. Better films this year include Social Network, Tangled, Toy Story 3 and Inception. It is a very dark film too, I don't recommend it for anyone who can't stand films with similar topics. Anyway, I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Good job, Natalie Portman.",7,2,5,7 January 2011
