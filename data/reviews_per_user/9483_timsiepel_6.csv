The King's Speech," pretty good BUT----
","No question this is a good movie; albeit a fairly minor one I think, about a footnote in history, and how a powerless figurehead king gained some respect at a critical period in not only his life, bu that of his country as well. My only beefs come from things I know as a physician. Firstly, I never heard anyone stutter the way Colin Firth does in this role. They usually sound a little more like Elmer Fudd, and we can certainly understand Colin not wanting to sound like Elmer, because that's comical, but then, how did you get 'Best Actor' when you didn't accurately portray what a stutterer really sounds like? Likewise for the competently played but one dimensional figure of the supportive wife, also nominated inexplicably for 'Best Actress'. My other 'doctor' type complaint concerns the death scene of George V. Hollywood just doesn't get death scenes; they have no idea what people look like when they die, how pale and gray and awful they look. The Hollywood death scenes always include some pink ruddy-looking chap trying to lie still with no expression on his face. It's just not like that!",7,0,3,13 March 2011
3:10 to Yuma," strong acting almost saves improbable plot
","In this morality of wishful thinking, hardened criminal Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) becomes so impressed by the decency of his captor, rancher Dan Evans (Christian Bale), that he decides to voluntarily assist him in his almost impossible task of delivering himself as prisoner to Yuma in time to catch the 3:10 train to prison, where he will face certain and well deserved execution. Strong directing and especially strong acting almost save this film from its improbable plot. The most ridiculous scenes I thought were in the final chase when the prisoner, leading the way to the train station, has to jump from one roof to another. Before he attempts the jump, he turns back to his captor and says, 'Can you make it?', as though, if one legged Dan can't do it, the 2 legged prisoner won't try it either! Heavens no, he might get away. Then , when Ben's devoted gang finally does rescue him, he shoots them all and jumps into the jail cell on the train! Even though Dan is already dead, it is still important to impress Dan's son, who appears at times to be wavering on the path of righteousness. Those of you who work as marshals, delivering prisoners to court and having to transport them on public conveyances, should not expect them to behave according to Mr Wades standards. Expect the worst instead, as a man's instinct for survival and freedom is more likely to overpower any passing affection for 14 yr old kids he met 2 days ago. It's hard to believe Elmore Leonard ever wrote a piece of crap like this, but it was in the 50's , and that's what was selling in those days. A man's got to eat. Harder still to believe is that many sophisticated reviewers like Roger Ebert thought this was a good movie.",Null,1,3,14 October 2007
Inglourious Basterds," wishful thinking
","In the years after the USA got its ass kicked in Vietnam, we were treated to a spate of movies in which white American commandos (Rambo etc) wreaked havoc on Asian enemies. How simple, I thought. If you can't win the war, just make a movie in which you won. So much easier! This piece is of the same genre. The actual history of Americans and American Jews WWII is somewhat spotty. The Americans turned away the MS St Louis in 1939, sending its cargo of desperate Jewish refugees back on their voyage of the damned, to be returned to Nazi dominated Germany.The Americans inexplicably failed to bomb the rail line to Auschwitz when they had complete control of the skies. When the Jews of Warsaw finally mounted a spirited resistance, the Americans and Brits refused to come to their aid. As for the Jews, they are still embarrassed by how docile they were in the face of Nazi aggression. The were led like sheep to the slaughter, and at the final execution they were executed by their own, Jewish capos who turned traitor to live a few more weeks. Much to be ashamed of, on both sides.Far better to make a movie in which we all behaved differently. In this one heroic Jewish commandos operate with impunity behind German lines, terrorizing the Wehmacht with American Indian tactics, then finally assassinating the entire German high command in a stroke of bold genius. If only that had happened. In fact the only serious attempt on Hitler's life came at the hands of Col von Stauffenburg, a German officer. Had he had the courage of a modern Arab suicide bomber, to stay with his bomb until it detonated, the war would have come to a much earlier and less bloody conclusion. There is a scene in the movie where the German high command is watching a propaganda movie and enjoying it thoroughly. The movie spoofs them, because it is not a very good movie. How many of the audience realized, that we were doing the same thing?The danger of this kind of movie, is that young viewers, unfamiliar with history, might mistake this fantasy for reality. Would that it were so, kids. Real history is a lot more messy.",Null,1,4,14 March 2010
Gone Girl," A real B movie!
","What makes a 'B' movie? And is a B movie still a B movie, if it has 'A' performances by first ranked actors? That is the question.It's hard to review this movie without including spoilers, because it is the end of the movie, indeed the last half of the movie, that is so poorly done. Let the viewer beware. If you don't mind contrived plots, jarringly inconsistent characterizations, and phony denouements, you may indeed like this movie. I even liked it, just like I enjoy some of the trashy B movies I may wander into on the TV at 3 am. We've all seen these movies. They favor a trick of plot at the end, something you never saw coming, if only because the actions are totally inconsistent with the character they had developed, and duped you into accepting. They favor gratuitous sex and violence, even if totally our of character, and unlikely to succeed in the real world we live in every day. They favor incredible (literally) twists of plot, innocent people being persecuted by bad people, who in the end turn out to be good, and the good people bad, or vice versa, or whatever. I enjoyed the movie. I'm just sorry I paid 10 bucks to see it in a theater. I could have waited a few years and seen it on TV. At 3 am.",4,9,21,19 October 2014
Les Mis√©rables," Good bye Javert
","The best part of this movie was when Javert jumped in the Seine, because I knew I wouldn't have to listen to Russell Crowe sing any more. Unfortunately, Hugh Jackman's character lived on, for another half hour. As someone who can't sing, I can sympathize with the plight of Mssrs Crowe and Jackman: How can one turn down all that money, despite the risk of permanently damaging one's career, and humiliating oneself in front of thousands of real singers! I suppose I too, would have humbled myself, and taken the job. Thankfully, I wasn't asked. It must be admitted that several of the supporting players, such as Amanda Seyfridd, did very well, and we thank them for that.",3,1,7,19 January 2013
Flight," Chickened out
","This is a pretty good movie, with a fatal flaw. First I want to tell you what I liked about it, then I want to show you what I think was its fatal flaw.First of all, I liked the characterization of an alcoholic. As a family physician and a suboxone prescriber, I have worked with a lot of drug addicts and alcoholics, and I found this movie to be one of the best portrayals of the struggles they face that I have seen. I liked the scene especially where he comes home and cleans out all the alcohol he has hidden; then, as soon as he is under more stress, he buys it all back. I like the way he got totally drunk the night before his big make or break hearing. That's what they do. (Even though it was a bit contrived; I have never seen anywhere near that amount of alcohol in a room fridge of a hotel; nor have I ever seen anyone leave a door open while closing the dead bolt; but whatever). Anyway, back to the praises, the writer here clearly knows his stuff and has been around drinkers; or maybe is one, I dunno.It must be acknowledged that this is a great performance by Denzel Washington. I have never seen him act like this. I didn't know he was capable of it. He too must have been around drinkers, and knows their ways. The facial expressions, the lies, everything. He has it down, and is pretty much in character most of the time.Now for what I think is the fatal flaw. OK, the thesis is that drinking and driving is bad, right, because it impairs our ability, and places ourselves and others at risk. This is accepted, and there is plenty of data to back this up. Motor vehicle fatalities are down as a result of stricter enforcement of DWI laws, etc. Except, drinkers know it ain't always so. In New York, for example, until very recently our limit was 0.12, and I many times drove over that. Today, if you are even at 0.09, you can become a felon. There is quite a difference in performance between someone who is used to drinking, and someone who is not. I have seen a man walking and conversing normally, who later had a 0.60 on a blood test! Kids have died from less than that.The movie seems to be making a case for this unpopular viewpoint when it has Whip, sporting a 0.25, do a super human flight maneuver that 10 expert pilots tried later (on a flight simulator) to equal, and could not, and thereby save a 100 lives, more or less. At this point, the movie seems to be making a powerful argument FOR drunk driving, or at least, drunk piloting of passenger jets with disabled elevators.Then the movie returns to its anti-alcoholism motif, as Whip slowly begins to fall apart, then in a heroic confession, owns up to it all and begins the painful process of taking responsibility and becoming rehabbed. This also didn't quite ring true; my alcoholics don't own up to anything unless they are absolutely forced, and he clearly still had an out here, and a rather easy one at that.Well, which is it writers? Is alcohol really that bad, and if so, why did you have Whip save the day with this expert feat of flying. while drunk? (would that be FWI?)Why this uncertainty, writers, that results in such a confused message? I don't know. But my thought is that a more real life scenario, in which Whip crashes the plane, and the autopsy shows that he was drunk and died in disgrace, must have been unacceptable for some reason. Or, alternatively the co pilot takes control, saves the day, and again Whip is hauled off in tears into disgrace. That too, must have been deemed unacceptable for some reason.I think that reason, for it having been written the way it was, is the phenomenon of THE STAR. Denzel Washington is a star, man, a celebrity, and a member of an historically denigrated minority. We can't have him playing a moral reprobate such as his character would have become, in either of the more realistic scenarios that I propose. Why, Hollywood could even have been accused of racism, having a drunken black pilot rescued by a sober white one, or killing all them white folks. An unacceptable bow to stereotypes! It couldn't be done.So instead we come up with this far fetched and contradictory business of a drunken black pilot outperforming 10 expert (?white) ones, then heroically turning himself in, saying 'Boys, even though I just showed that drunks CAN fly, I am not saying drunks SHOULD fly!', and going off nobly to prison, where he rehabilitates not only himself, but a bunch of others while he's there. And along the way, he also rescues a forlorn heroin addict that he happened to pick up looking for a little sex. The real villain of the plane crash? Those bad corporate guys, trying to make a little extra money by not doing the required maintenance. Oh, I should have guessed! Now that's a movie, and that's a star! Hollywood style. Don't make no sense, but it's good entertainment. And a great visual of a plane flying upside down.",Null,1,2,12 April 2013
