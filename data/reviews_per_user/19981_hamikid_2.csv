Antz," Creepy
",This movie is creepy af. The animation is style looks as tho a kid styled it. The scripting is seriously written by a 5 year old and I will not be sold on otherwise. I recommend this to Guantanamo Bay.,2,0,4,5 April 2019
Room," intense, heart warming, and very deliberate
","Room is by far one of the most intense movies I've seen in a while, the tension is everywhere and it honestly is frightining. There are also severalparts in which I almsot cried due to its heartwarming, Brie deffinetly deserved that Oscar, and the director and screen writer should also be excepionally regarded. I highly reccomend this film to anyone, but at the right moment.",10,0,1,19 February 2018
