The Blair Witch Project," You may want to bring an extra pair of undies...
","Its trailer was vague, its plot was strange, and its characters were unheard of.  After hearing much gossip and reading several reviews, 'The Blair Witch Project' seemed more and more intriguing to me.  I had to go out-of-town to see the film so I was very ready to see it.  When the movie came on...not a single credit...not a single note of music.  Just the title.  As the movie went on, the arguing and constant bickering did get a bit annoying.  But a single event caused the arguing to stop (I won't give it away to those who haven't seen it).  But, best of all, the end of the movie.  The conclusion of the movie truly scared me silly.  The confusion that occurs in the end, the madness in their minds...it amazed me.  The ending BLEW ME AWAY.  It was excellent.  So, all of you who haven't seen it yet, pay close attention, and prepare yourself for a brilliantly horrifying end.",10,1,2,2 August 1999
