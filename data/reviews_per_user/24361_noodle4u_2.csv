The Longest Yard," Give me my money back
","It's not all that funny, and it's not all that entertaining. Sorry, but this is one of those movies that has the potential to be great, and is turned into a simpleton's guide as to how not to make a comedy. Save the money and rent it...it's actually something I would rent, not having already seen it at the cinema, that being said, I once rented 'Bring It On.' It's really quite ashame because this is one of a long line a many movies based on the original, and all have the same premise...some different sports, and of all of them, this is by far the worst, with the best cast. I'm a huge fan of Sandler and Rock, and I would think that the combination would be amazing, only to be let down.",5,1,3,18 June 2005
Batman Begins," Better than that pants movie
","I thought that it was a decent movie, worthy of a trip to the theater. However, it does take a bit of time to really take Bale as Batman as actual fact, although I think he did a great job as the alter ego 'Bruce Wayne'. The movie seemed to drag a bit, and the action scenes were chalked full of so many cuts, that I almost threw-up a couple times. I think that what this movie lacked the most was a known villain. All and all, it's more of a let down due to the fact that there are quite a few good actors in this movie, and I guess I expected more. Dialogue is trite and at times corny, and comic relief seems labored. For a movie that claims to be a throw-back to the original Batman, it falls far short...although, if this becomes a new series, it will be better, which is the most visible problem This is a film that has followed some great, and some horrible movies of the same name and series. To say this one is along the same lines as Burton's 'Batman' of the early 90's is not so. I say start a new series using the new style and there might be a winner.",6,1,5,18 June 2005
