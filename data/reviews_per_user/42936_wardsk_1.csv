"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Fabulous darling!
",This is absolutely my favourite film.  Felicia is my favourite character. The songs are great you'll want to sing along.  It is just so very funny. I've never seen Guy Pearce look so good!  They all look fabulous and play their parts well.  A must see!!!,Null,1,3,6 December 2000
