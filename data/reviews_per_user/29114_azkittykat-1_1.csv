Captain Phillips," Great film---review by a normal person and not some film critic wannabe:)
","First of all, the telling of this 'based on a true story' film was excellent. Tom Hanks, as usual, was great. Love the new guy from Africa that played the main pirate was a tremendously great first time major film actor:) My husband and I don't really like most of the movies now days, they seem poorly scripted, a lot of times poorly acted and pretty 'meh' but this one kept us on the edge of our seats the entire time pretty much. Truly a great suspenseful film to watch and even if you know the story by reading the book, you still will like it:)Omg, they are making me put 10 lines to have this submitted, how stupid, huh? Lol, there goes 10:)",9,1,4,4 May 2014
