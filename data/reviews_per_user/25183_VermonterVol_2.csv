The Longest Yard," No Wonder Eddie Albert Just Kicked
","I would echo the sentiments of those who said this is a very pale imitation of the original. No wonder Eddie Albert died the day before its release. I didn't believe any of the actors because of the poor character development -- the dialog was extremely wooden, even from Cromwell, who can do much better. Sandler showed no emotion and gave the audience little reason to support of empathize with him. Rock does a good job ad-libbing through a poorly re-written script (the original screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn was great. He must be cringing through every minute watching this hash). I found myself for much of the movie comparing scenes, line delivery and dialog with the original. And nine times out of 10, the remake came up lacking. Sadly, Hollywood is not going to get the message we all want this poorly made film to deliver, because it will do extremely well at the box office thanks to the casting of Sandler, Nelly and the ex-jocks, bringing a built-in audience. Only source of enjoyment to me were the less obvious cameos, including Dan Patrick as the Miami traffic cop.",3,20,43,29 May 2005
Captain Marvel," Fun ride.
","I'd normally rate it an 8, but bumping it two to counter some of the misogynistic bullshiat here.",10,3,10,18 July 2019
