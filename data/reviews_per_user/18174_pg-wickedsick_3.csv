Lucky Number Slevin," very good
","I must admit,this was one of the very good surprises that I've had last year,I'm not a fan of Josh Hartnett (not even close),but I gotta say he did an awesome performance during the movie,and Bruce Willis...what can I say? simply one of the best in my opinion, the whole plot demands the need to see even more until the resolution. Very good movie for those who like to exercise their minds to solve the clues,find motivations,for those who simply like to see Bruce Willis in a less action-like role,but with pure 100% good acting,and why not? for those who like to laugh with Josh Hartness pure innocence and 'naifity', and Morgan Freeman...do I even need to say anything about this man? I don't think so,it's just a 'must see because I know this guy will fill out my soul', his incomparable style just gives an extra touch of class in the type of action - not brutal,but an 60's gangster type of action - and for those who love sweet Asian beauty's you have Lucy Liu,but honestly,a think she's a little apart from the kind of movie,now here's a movie where I would like to see Sandra Bullock,just to see if she's able to perform in an action like environment movie.",8,0,1,18 April 2007

","It wasn't good....It was great!!!! remarkable performances,Morgan Freeman at his best,simply brilliant!!! Gwyneth Paltrow doing a role like few women would have succeed in this type of movies,and Brad Pitt was pretty good too(despite not liking him...)I fell the need to glue my eyes to the screen,this movie filled me up right from the beginning!! fine acting,fine plot,great effects,the timeline sequence of every event was completely flawless,and why not? Everyone should learn something about their morals with this movie,even the more obvious lesson, being obsessive in order to avoid the seven sins may be a sin itself. And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...",9,1,2,19 April 2007
Casino Royale," I didn't like that
","what?? did I read well?? 7.9?? I mean,where's the criteria? This movie was a joke,every 007 fan is still taking pills because they've watched this!! The others 007s had style,charisma,glamour,the typical 'je ne sai quoi' of every James Bond that I've ever seen,even with the Bond girls,he knew how to conquer them...but when you watch Daniel Craig,the concept 'WHAM BAM THANK YOU MAM!!' rises to a new level!!! this guy ain't no gentleman,this is not his league,he has no 007 class material!!! With a much more serious analysis, I felt that this movie was completely different of those that I've used to see back in the old 007 days. It lacked of action, a little too predictable and the choice of the actor wasn't the appropriate one,but let's face it,we're in the XXI century and we must evolve in other directions...even with 007, but some things should never change, specially the charisma of the character,he didn't conquered me...This was a weak movie in my opinion,they should return to the old drawing board",3,8,13,18 April 2007
