Black Swan," Sex and Darkness
","I find it amusing and a little disturbing that sex is considered the dark side. It's such a dated western perception. Its about time to leave these old myths behind How can such a healthy desire, to find a good mate and have quality children, be 'dark'. This misbegotten 'christian' tradition is no help. Some day it would be nice to see a positive portrayal. Love and sexual desire that our grand daughters understand would not be confused by the perverted perceptions of society propagated by Hollywood and other 'creative' types.
