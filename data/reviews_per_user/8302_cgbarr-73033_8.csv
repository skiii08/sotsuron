The Perks of Being a Wallflower," First and Last Time I'll Watch This
","It's a great movie and story, but it is so sad and full of hopelessness that it's hard to enjoy. Although watching this was a memorable experience, I don't want to watch it again because I feel like crap now.",8,0,0,10 May 2020
127 Hours," Incredible Story, Terrible Movie
","The story itself is absolutely phenomenal- but the quality of the movie itself is awful. The editing was absolutely ridiculous, and the music was even worst; of course, you only have to watch the first five minutes to realize this. Would I recommend watching the movie? Probably not. Don't get me wrong, Aron Ralston's story is incredibly inspirational and amazing; but at the same time, this movie is crap. Sorry.",5,1,5,31 August 2019
Ready Player One," Quirky movie, but I would recommend watching it!
","This movie is full of all sorts of pop culture references that every generation can appreciate, while also staying relevant to the current gaming culture. So basically, my mom and I loved it, although I understood more Easter eggs than she knew were there. Although it was occasionally cheesy and maybe a bit too weird for some people, the movie was still very entertaining and funny. It was good enough for me to want to purchase it so I can watch it again.",8,0,2,1 September 2019
The Book Thief," It's good, but not the book
","It's a great quality movie, but it lacked some of the context that gave a lot of the scenes significance. In fact, some of the most powerful moments in the plot were missing entirely. In terms of quality, it's a fine movie. It simply lacked the emotional intensity that made The Book Thief one of the best stories I've ever read. And however much I love Geoffrey Rush, his version of Hans was not a very accurate or worthy one- that could have easily been the director's fault though. If you haven't read the book, not everything will make sense, but you might enjoy the movie nonetheless.",7,0,0,3 July 2020
Shutter Island," Good Movie
","Some parts are a little predictable or cheesy, but the ending was excellent nonetheless. If you like plots that feel like a puzzle, this is a great movie to watch!",8,1,2,4 October 2019
"Girl, Interrupted"," Good movie
","I liked this movie and have no complaints. The actors were fantastic, the plot was pretty good (although I read that it doesn't entirely match up with the book), and I was moved by several scenes.",8,2,2,11 November 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Phenomenal
","The Lord of the Rings is one of the most iconic, memorable movies in history, and it deserves a FAR BETTER overall rating than an 8.9.",10,4,5,13 September 2019
Hacksaw Ridge," Phenomenal
","Some people are complaining that this movie is a load of liberal bull crap, but I think they misunderstood. The main character is opposed to using weapons purely because he made an oath to God to specifically never use a gun. This was a religious decision. If he had predicted that he would end up on the battlefield, I think he may not have made this promise. Unfortunately, he couldn't take back his words.The story itself is incredibly inspiring. Andrew Garfield is an excellent actor, and I would recommend everyone to see this movie.",9,1,1,11 November 2019
