Hereditary," Not really worth your time
",While watching this movie I experienced a couple of moments that shocked me but was left feeling this movie was over hyped by media. The story line was all over the place and at parts was confusing. In conclusion I would spend 2 hours and 7 mins watching something else.,2,1,5,31 August 2018
