Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great!
","This isn't just a movie..this is part of history..Why you ask? This  is because this movie has mostly everything people want in a movie, no nudity nor swearing.  Which is great because most movies have swearing in it... The saber fighting scenes were intense that made me sit on the edge of my seat wanting more. This is a movie everyone has to see more than oncePeace Manny",10,0,0,23 May 1999
