First Man," I wanted to at least like it...
","Ok I'm only 3/4 the way thru, so maybe I'm jumping the gun, but doubtful...I love Clair, and Ryan is ok, but like the others said , it's really slow...reallllyyyy slow. I'm a patient person in regards to movies, but wake me up when this movie gets to the end . It's a part of history tho, so I shall muddle thru.",4,1,3,9 February 2019
Hereditary," Wellllll....
","Heavy sigh...well, was really eager to see this movie, and, seems if there are well known, popular actors in these films, they automatically get high ratings, guess I'm odd that way, don't always feel the two go hand in hand. Acting was good tho! The storyline..mehhh, seemed to go on forever before anything remotely interesting happened, and after what seemed like a 4 hr. Never ending story, I didn't get it.
 Did I mention the acting was really good ?",4,1,5,13 October 2018
The Big Lebowski," The Big Dissapoint
","45 mins into the movie , and haven't even cracked a smile. What a stale movie, it's as though they are trying so desperately to be funny, and it's falling flat, real flat. Expected much more from the cast too. Disappointed",2,2,9,7 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Thumbs up from this chick ..
","Loved a lot about this movie, the whole 60s SoCal thing, had me smiling, being a kid and living in California, loved seeing all the nostalgia. Was nice to see Leo and Brad, together, being funny, always liked Leo, now a Brad fan. It was a tad long, and at times seemed to go in too many directions, but all in all a cute little movie, and the
music was great!The end made me a little sad...what if...what if...",8,2,2,24 February 2020
Marriage Story," May hit a nerve...
","Reading negative reviews , and wondering if it may be because it didn't hit home, like it did for many of us, if you've ever been thru a divorce, especially with children, you may find this hits a nerve, it did with me. I found the acting superb, the chemistry between Johansson and Driver, very real.
Was nice to have a bit of comedy relief thrown in also. It dragged maybe 20 mins long, but all in all, very good",7,3,4,9 February 2020
