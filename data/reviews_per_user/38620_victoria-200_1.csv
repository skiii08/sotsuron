Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat - totally uninspiring.
","Although i had been warned this film wasn't particularly funny, i was looking forward to seeing it. So i was surprised that by 15mins in , i hadn't come close to laughing. In fact by the end of the film i had not laughed once and the person i was watching it with had left the room. I'm certainly not devoid of a sense of humour but i am absolutely baffled as to why people would find this funny. Is it because i'm female and this appeals to a man's sense of humour? The humour was crude and unsophisticated and the story was wearisome. I was totally bored and uninspired. I would love to know exactly why people found this funny, because i just don't get it.",1,64,128,4 June 2007
