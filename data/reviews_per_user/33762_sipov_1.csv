The Equalizer," cool,tense,interesting film
","This is a really cracking film. Not the run-of-the-mill action plot I was expecting, a very pleasant surprise. The main character developed quiet slowly and was worth the patience of the viewer. His back story was not laid out on a plate for you. Much was held back and only hinted at. A genuinely cool, reserved character in the old sense. This is very refreshing and proves that - it is as much what you leave out, as put in, that makes an interesting film. The main bad guy (dark hair) in the film was riveting and as sinister as he was interesting. You can see some plot areas coming, but, as ever, wanted to see HOW he was going to get out of this one. It doesn't disappoint.I couldn't help having a bit of a giggle to myself, that a good alternative title for the film would be 'Showdown at B&Q' ! ( in the UK ) This was only a small momentary laplse of reason on my part and in no way should detract from the serious nature and quality of the film.Again, another great film located in Boston ! I'm not sure why, but it has a different, dark side to it and seems a good backdrop for a thriller/ heist/ mob related film.As well as dealing with the everyday details of the main character, it also was'not afraid to expand out to the bigger picture, towards the end - always the sign, I think, of a good, well balanced film. More importantly, one which doesn't insult your intelligence, too much. A film that, I get the feeling, has learned from the mistakes and lessons of other films that I may have not seen. It jumps just that little bit ahead of what I was expecting. This gives it an interesting edge.A great, enjoyable film",8,1,7,28 September 2014
