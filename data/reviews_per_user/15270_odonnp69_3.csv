Alien 3," See the special edition
",If only the special edition had been released as the cinematic version in 1992.Its just a better version and fills in some of the story more.Wont spoil it but does have a different feel than the original and was more the story they wanted to tell.,9,1,1,2 March 2019
Alien," Never been bettered
","From start to finish u just wanted away from the alien.A great cast with a very claustrophobic atmosphere this is a classic.It spawned many sequels but other than aliens this was the best sci fi horror ever.Never did see it in the cinema which is a regret,it just should be watched enjoyed and passed on,this is real acid fi horror at its best.",10,0,1,9 February 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The saga begins
","With so many positive reviews I'm sure anyone still left,who hasn't seen the fellowship of the ring,will be online watching it soon.As a film it has no peers,all 3 films are different but need to be seen in chronological order to fully enjoy.The action is more bloody in 2 and 3 but the mines of moria is the scene stealer in the f.o.t.r. Never walked out a theatre so disappointed that I had to wait a year to see the sequel.Ive only once watched 1 and 2 back to back on the same day,it was a long day but watched every scene and was caught up in the whole adventure.",10,0,0,8 June 2019
