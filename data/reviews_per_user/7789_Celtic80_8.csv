Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great movie and good set up for the rest of the Star Wars Saga....
","First came the original Star Wars trilogy.  As of 1999, Star Wars is now a movie saga with The Phantom Menace.  This movie blew me away with it's special effects which, helped, not hindered the story like some critics say. The story was more complex than the rest of the saga and perhaps looks more creative, since George Lucas' vision could literally come to life with new CGI technology.The acting in The Phantom Menace is as good, if not better than The Empire Strikes Back.  Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman (a real babe...), Ian McDiarmid, Jake Lloyd, Ewan McGreggor, and Amhed Best (yes, I mean it) did excellent jobs of carrying their characters.  I found that the most fascinating characters were Darth Maul, Queen Padme Naberrie Amidala, and Darth Sidious. Nevertheless, all of the acting is top notch, thanks to a great cast.After hearing some early reviews (which I blatantly try to avoid...), I expected to see a sub-par Star Wars movie that I would still love, but the special effects would get in the way of character development and the story. Well, I should not have listened because that was all wrong.  Like the other movies, the special effects help tell a story that otherwise could not be told without them.  Part of the story telling is visual, not just brought along by the characters.  Although I agree that there isn't as much character development as the other Star Wars Movies, I know it is because The Phantom Menace is just a set up for the rest of the saga.  Whether it may or may not annoy some is not relevant.  The only thing I had a problem with is that the whole Star Wars universe, which has gotten so big and lifelike, felt a lot smaller, since it did not have the galactic events that happened in the other Star Wars movies.  However, my view on that is changing, after I have seen The Phantom Menace seven times.Now, Jar-Jar.  Like the Ewoks, he has gotten a hate cult.  Well, let those people hate him, because I don't.  I thought Jar-Jar was a worthy addition to the Star Wars universe, if a little hard to understand.  He was mainly made for the kids, but what made me like him is that he is totally different from everything else.  Oh, and on the charges of racism, Amhed Best is the one that really created Jar-Jar Binks' movement and accent (Boss Nass' sounded different from Jar-Jar's), and I don't think he had any racist thoughts when he created them, because he is black (I hate using that word to describe a person...people are people no matter what color they are, but I digress...).  I am sorry if I offend someone with my opinion.  I like Jar-Jar!This is a worthy addition to the Star Wars saga, and I think it is the best movie of the year, since I'm a Star Wars freak and I had a lot of fun in the theater seven times watching it. I can't wait for the next one damn it!  The soundtrack by John Williams is great, especially with Duel of Fates and Anakin's Theme.  If nothing else, see it for Natalie Portman.***** stars (out of *****).",10,3,6,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the most imaginative, if not best movies of '99
","Screw the critics, this movie kicks. Yes, it does have some awkward dialogue and acting, but I don't think even the old trilogy's dialogue and acting were the greatest strength of the movies (do normal people suddenly stand up and go into some sentimental soliloquy like most critically successful movies?). The best thing about the old trilogy and The Phantom Menace are imagination, setting, mysterious mythical history, good vs. evil (good triumphing over evil), cool machines, and masterful action.  Another thing was that I think people were expecting the old trilogy.  Well, get your heads out the clouds, its not the old trilogy.I have been a Star Wars fan for as long as I can remember. However, I am not a fanatic, since I do not collect SW toys, or even stood in line the first day. The main thing I like most is how creative the movies are, and how much creativity is put into the movies. Big L and the rest of the team (including Zahn and Kevin J Anderson, etc...) have created a living, breathing universe and spawned a psueudo-religion, as well as giving a couple of new and much needed fairy tales for our time. Now with all this digital technology, all the things that are in George Lucas' mind can be put into the movie. I think that is great, not an over use of digital technology.To close off my ranting (heh heh heh...)I have to say that I haven't had that much fun watching a movie in a long time, and if a movie can do that, TPM deserves to be on my best movie list. Go see it while it's still in the theaters! And about the whole Jar-Jar thing, lay off! I didn't really like Jar-Jar that much either, but come on! If people thought Jar-Jar was too childish, the website jarjarmustdie isn't any better. Actually, after seeing TPM 7 times, Jar-Jar starts to grow on you...",10,0,0,24 July 1999
The 13th Warrior," A fair movie... probably not as good as the book....
","I had heard much about Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton from a friend, and I thought that the previews for the 13th Warrior were cool. So today, I decided to go and see it. The 13th Warrior was not bad, but it was not a great movie. Some of the lines of dialogue were almost incomprehensible, most, of which I blame the theater for because they turned the soundtrack up to high. That is why I am not including it with criticism below.The 13th Warrior is based, somewhat loosely on the Eaters of the Dead. It is about an Arab poet named Ibn Fadlan who is banished from Bagdad because he got the good graces of the Caliphates wife. He is then sent as an ambassador to the barbaric North. On the way, he encounters Vikings. He spends some time with them, and then a messenger from up north sends a message that other Vikings have been attacked. From then, it is up to thirteen warriors to help. Ibn ends up being one of them. The attacks come from an ancient threat that the Vikings are not quite ready to face, and neither is Fadlan, for he is a poet, not a warrior.First, the good stuff: the premise of the story, adapted from the book, is very creative and intriguing. When I was able to understand the dialogue, the acting was good. The visuals of the movie, the landscapes, the battles, and one cool ocean voyage on a Viking ship are top notch. They carry most of the movie through. Lastly, with all of its faults, the movie is entertaining.Now the bad stuff: the editing in the movie left something to be desired. Scenes looked like they were transitioning too fast. Some of the scene changes were so fast that you could not grasp the meaning of the previous scene. Some of Banderas' dialogue was hard to understand because of his Arabian accent (he did too well of a jobÂ…). My last complaint is that the battle scenes were too dark and confusing to see what was going on. It was probably meant to be that way though.This movie is not the greatest ever made, but it is adequate and entertaining, if you have nothing else to do, see it in the theater. Otherwise, make sure you see as a rental. *** stars (out of *****).",Null,0,0,28 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A good movie, not one of the best ever made, but still Star Wars....
","A New Hope blew audiences away with original special effects and story telling.  The Empire Strikes Back blew audiences away again for doing the same thing at a superior level.  Return of the Jedi has come around to tie up all the loose ends the first two movies made.  The story, although similar to A New Hope, is not recycled.  The special effects are even better than Empire and they are the peak of that time.  The acting has stayed at the same level as Empire, which both are better than A New Hope.The acting in Return of the Jedi is about the same as Empire.  There aren't any real new changes except that Han Solo's character gets a bit softer as he realizes he does not need his gruff exterior among friends that love him. We also finally find out which side Lando is on.  However, the best addition and the best actor in Return of the Jedi is Ian McDiarmid, who plays the Emperor (aka Senator Palpatine, Darth Sidious).The story, while some say it is recycled from A New Hope (which it definitely is not), ties up loose ends.  The second Death Star is merely a backdrop for the main story of Vader and Luke.  In any case, the Death Star was already being built after the first one was destroyed, as a plan of the Emperors to destroy the Rebellion.  We get to see Luke, Chewie, Lando, and Leia go after Han Solo to rescue him.  Jabba the Hutt is wiped from the Universe, and they meet...the Ewoks....  I think the best plot in Jedi is the one with Luke, Vader, and the Emperor.  Luke tries to turn his father from the Dark Side and resist temptation from the Emperor.  It is the heart of the movie.Now, the Ewoks.  Like Jar-Jar, they have a hate cult.  Why?  I have never understood how people can have such a childish hate over fictional creatures.  They serve the purpose of the story.  The main reason is that the Ewoks overcoming the Empire's vast technology stretched believability. Maybe so, but hey, this is a sci-fi fantasy.  It was more fun to watch the Ewoks beat the crap out of the Stormtroopers.  Also, the Ewoks overcoming the Stormtroopers is more metaphorical.  Lucas always has a part in the Star Wars movies where technology fails, and it is up to the human (or alien) spirit to finish the job, not the technology (i.e., Luke when he destroyed the Death Star without a computer...).The ending of Jedi is the most rewarding of the trilogy, with a powerful and slam-bang ending to the best movie saga of all time.  Darth Vader becomes Anakin again, coming to his son's aid and destroying the Emperor, sacrificing his own life in the process.  There is just something rewarding seeing Anakin glimmer in the Force next to Yoda and Obi-Wan.  In all this is a good movie.  It is not the best Star Wars movie, but it is still Star Wars.  It still adds to the mythology, and therefore is a classic, Ewoks or no Ewoks.  However, I think the Jedi soundtrack is the best of the saga, so check it out.  See the whole trilogy! ***** stars (out of *****)",10,1,3,10 August 1999
Blade Runner," One of the great science fiction movies....
","Bladerunner starts out with a breathtaking scene that makes me cringe at the thought of our cities getting that bloated in the future. From this first scene, the whole movie sets up a great atmosphere that is not broken throughout the whole film. I sat enraptured, my eyes not moving from the screen for fear that I would miss something on screen. Okay, well, I admit that the first time I saw this movie I thought it was boring. Well, I was stupid and young. Now that it is out on DVD, I can enjoy it in all its film noir/sci-fi glory. By the way, this review is to the Director's Cut, which is the way it should be seen.It is 2019 and the technology of replicants has had some unexpected backfires. They look like humans; however, they are physically superior, if not mentally equal. A special police unit of Bladerunners has been created to combat this problem if they ever come to Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford), is a retired Bladerunner who is brought back to track down and 'retire' four replicants who sneaked into Earth. As he tracks the lead replicant (Rutger Hauer) and begins a love affair with a female experimental replicant, he begins to acquire clues that show him he may not be who he thinks he is..The acting in this movie is very good. Any movie with 'the man' Harrison Ford seems to be good. Most of the emotional qualities of the characters seem flat, but that is what I would expect from the future that they live in. Harrison Ford is great as the Bladerunner Deckard, and Sean Young does well by playing his love interest Rachael. But Rutger Hauer does a really great job as a replicant who is desperate to survive.Let me just say that the special effects for this movie are really realistic, and they help get the feeling of an overblown gothic 50's city. The rest of the movie really does seem like it is during the post WWII years, but in a science fiction future. This movie is original and has the same qualities that make movies like The Matrix great. Any lover of science fiction should like this movie, but I know that it is not everyone's cup of tea. It is violent and it is slow moving, but it is beautifully shot, each scene done with care. I recommend it, and it is one of my favorite science fiction movies. Make sure you see the director's cut, and not the other one, with the dumb producer/Hollywood movie ending.****1/2 stars (out of *****).",9,0,0,21 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Perhaps the greatest movie ever....
","When I was a sophomore in middle school, and Star Wars was still on modified to fit your screen, no THX mastered, VHS tape, I watched the Star Wars trilogy repeatedly.  Before then, I had never really been a Star Wars fan. I had only been old enough to see Return of the Jedi in a theater, and it really didn't catch on for me.  However, since my sophomore year I have been a fanatic.  Why?  Because Star Wars actually helped me through one of the more difficult parts of my life by giving me a positive message a feeling every time I viewed the trilogy.A New Hope, the first in the Star Wars saga, is perhaps the best of the trilogy (although I think Empire is a better motion picture) because it was a visionary breakthrough.  The kind of storytelling in A New Hope had never been seen before.  'I long time ago in a galaxy far, far away' has become our generation's 'once upon a time.' Star Wars really gave us a much-needed fairy tale (a sci-fi fairy tale).  The way the special effects were done was new, the kind of machinery and creatures had never really been thought of before.  All of this is layered in with a classic story of a simple boy who rescues a princess with the aid of a pirate and a wizard.  The Force, a sort of stand in for different religions became almost a religion of its own. George Lucas created a living, breathing universe while telling his story, giving others a chance to play around in it.  All of these traits give A New Hope the title of one of the greatest movies ever made.The acting in A New Hope is adequate.  I admit that some lines of dialogue are cheesy, but I have never encountered a movie that has had perfect dialogue.  Mark Hamill got better as time went on, but he did a good job as a wide eyed farm boy.  Harrison Ford did a good job as a nervous, but seemingly self-assured smuggler.  Carrie Fisher was good as a strong princess.  Alec Guinness, well, his acting is always excellent.  David Prowse and James Earl Jones create a menacing Darth Vader.  Other supporting characters also did a good job.However, I think the best parts of A New Hope come from the story, the aliens, the machines, special effects, and the music!  The special effects help tell the story in A New Hope, and they do the same thing in all the other Star Wars movies.  All of the machines and aliens were things that I had never seen before, yet seemed familiar.  They help to create the illusion of a living, breathing universe, with things happening elsewhere. Also, the music for A New Hope is top notch, and John Williams led me into the world of classical music.  If you can get the Star Wars: Special Edition soundtracks, do so and treat yourself!As a devoted fan to the Star Wars saga, I have read most of the books and comic books that have come out, I've played all the games, I have seen the Star Wars trilogy on the big screen, more times than I can count on VHS, and I have seen The Phantom Menace seven times!  Because I am such a fan, I probably will not see anything wrong with any of the stuff that comes out on Star Wars that some outsiders do.  However, I think A New Hope is the closest a movie can come to being perfect.  See it now, if you have already seen it a million times or if it is your first time.  ***** stars (out of *****.)",Null,0,0,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Also perhaps the greatest movie ever made....
","A New Hope set the standard in movie storytelling and special effects.  The Empire Strikes Back blows that away.  A New Hope and The Empire Strikes back, to me, are about equal in their greatness, but for different reasons. While A New Hope was great because it was the first that broke new ground, The Empire Strikes back is great because it broke new ground while having an almost entirely different story, mood, and flavor than it's predecessor.The acting in The Empire Strikes Back is superior to A New Hope.  Mark Hamill definitely got better at acting, and really got into his wide-eyed, impatient, trying to become a Jedi character.  Harrison Ford put more depth into Han Solo, making him more complex than just a shady smuggler.  Carrie Fisher gave a new dimension to Princess Leia by showing her attraction to Han Solo, and the way she shows it.  And of course, David Prowse/James E. Jones as Darth Vader, giving one of the most earth shattering revelations in a motion picture saga.  Anthony Daniels (who I forgot in my review of A New Hope) gives more comic relief to the movie with C-3PO.  An interesting new addition is Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissan.  As Solo gets more complex, we were given a new character who's shady background made for a shaky alliance with the other characters.  Also, who could forget Frank Oz puppeting Yoda, who has almost become a modern philosopher for our time.
The story and special effects of Empire blow away what A New Hope had already created as top notch.  The models are much more detailed a realistic and they serve the story even more.  I can remember as a kid being scared of the Imperial Probe Droid, which reminded me of a spider for some reason. The story is better with a darker mood.  Empire is really the heart of the story, going further into the mysteries of the Force and character development and backgrounds.  There is a sense of dread as Darth Vader talks to the Emperor, who is really orchestrating all of these events.  Also, Darth Vader's revelation at the end is shocking if you have never seen the movie before.The Empire Strikes back relied less on a large action scene and instead has many little ones with a great lightsaber duel at the end (although it is nothing compared to the lightsaber duel in The Phantom Menace).  Empire adds on to the modern mythology that A New Hope started and 'is' the best sequel ever.  I personally think it is the best out of all of the Star Wars movies, although it is hard to choose.  Go see it. ***** stars (out of *****).",10,0,0,10 August 1999
Contact," Among the best realistic science fiction films....
","In '97, I read the book, Contact (Sagan, 1985) and then saw the movie.  I was not disappointed, although the movie was so much different from the book, and I wished they could have put more elements from the book into the movie.  The acting is great, especially with Jodie Foster.  The special effects are not really that wowing and they are not meant to be, it is supposed to be realistic, and they achieved their goal.  As a fan of Carl Sagan, I think this movie did justice for him, although he did not live to see it.The acting is very strong, especially with Jodie Foster.  She did a good job of bringing Ellie's character to life.  Another important actor in the movie, Matthew McConaughey, also did a good job of bringing Palmer Joss to life.  The rest of the characters were rather shuffled to the background, except for two annoying ones (James Woods character and Tom Skerrit's).  You have to keep rewinding the parts with the Christian Fundie character.  He's funny.The story of the film is great, even if different from the book, and is a little slow at first, but then its not a sci-fi action flick.  Some people groaned at the ending, but this is not a movie that lets you see anything. It's most important messages are that all humans have are themselves, and I think more people need to realize that.I highly recommend this film, and again, try to get it on DVD. ****1/2 stars (out of *****).",9,1,3,13 August 1999
