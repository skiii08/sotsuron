Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," good film
",I just saw this film. Great movie. I'm 21 years old and I didn't really care if it was too cartoonish. I went in expecting it to be real bad but I was pleasantly surprised. The pod race was brilliant!,Null,0,0,13 June 1999
American Pie," A fun movie
","This movie is a load of laughs. I'm sorry, but to anyone who hated this movie, you were taking it too seriously or it just wasn't your cup of tea. I'm a 21 year old university student and I expected a fun movie and that's exactly what I got. In fact, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It's a gross-out film with a moral conscience, though it perhaps lays it on a tad too thick. I don't want to give away too much, but alot of the things that occur are just implausible and ridiculous. And that's why I found it a barrel of laughs. You'll find yourself laughing along with the characters, while some moments will make you squirm and force you to ask yourself, 'Did that ever happen to me?' It's a question many of us may not like the answer to. This is a fun film that I think should be seen by those who are out of school, rather than those still there. It's also good to see Eugene Levy again.",7,0,0,16 October 1999
The Sixth Sense," Very Good Film
","This is a very good movie. But it isn't great, or as good as people are raving about. It moves very slowly for most of the film, but that's to be expected from a character-driven film. I can't say much about the narrative...needless to say, this is one film you should see again as soon as possible. All the actors turned in realistic and heart-felt performances, especially the young boy. Here's something to ponder: Bruce Willis can actually act. Now THAT is scary.8/10",8,0,0,26 October 1999
