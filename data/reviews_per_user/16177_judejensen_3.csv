Scarface," Classic Gangster film
","'Scarface' is probably my favorite gangster movie, though I think 'The Godfather: Part 2' and 'Casino' are overall better films, I prefer 'Scarface' for nostalgic reasons. I first saw this movie when I rented it from my local Library when I was about 11 or 12 years old, I watched it, and I was blown away. Al Pacino plays a refugee from Cuba. He's struggling to earn money, so he starts selling drugs. He starts off as a pretty likeable character, but slowly turns into a monster. Though, he's not a complete monster, he refuses to blow up a car, because there are kids inside. You see a man rise to the top of the world, until his anger and lust for power are eventually his downfall. And who could forget about the shootout scene at the end? It includes probably the most famous movie quote of all time- 'Say Hello, To My Lil Friend!!!'",10,0,0,17 January 2019
Akira," Most iconic anime film of all-time
","Man oh man, is this film bad-ass. This movie is a masterpiece, its pure genius. The film is about Kaneda, the leader of a biker gang, in the 'future year of 2019'. After Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo is captured by the government, Kaneda attempts to rescue him...but after Tetsuo starts displaying strange powers, things take a decidedly strange turn. This is probably the most violent animated film I've ever seen, a mans guts spill out all over the street, a mans arm gets cut off, a man gets shot to shreds, and a guy gets his jaw shot off, it's insane. The movie starts off pretty normal, but things get really weird at the end. Its a movie that requires more than one viewing. Top notch animation,with over-the-top gore blend to create one of the most iconic animes of all-time.",10,0,1,26 January 2019
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Most Iconic stop-motion film of all-time
","'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is not my favorite Disney or Favorite Tim Burton film however, it's pretty damn close. This film is so nostalgic for me, and I felt this film deserved a spot on this list. This film is actually not directed by Tim Burton, it's directed by Henry Selick, who also did 'Coraline' and 'James and the Giant Peach'. Though, Tim Burton did create the entire story and all the characters. This movie has some of the greatest music ever put in a film, especially 'Jack's Lament', which is my favorite track. Danny Elfman voiced Jack's singing voice, but they had Chris Sarandon do the dialogue. The film is beautifully shot, and contains some very impressive stop-motion. Overall, 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is probably the most iconic stop-motion of all-time, and has some of the most iconic imagery ever put on film.",10,2,2,17 January 2019
