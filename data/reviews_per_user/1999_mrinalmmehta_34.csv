Ford v Ferrari," The perfect balance
","You know the best part of the whole movie? It's not Bale, Damon or the cars. They and the cars are already on the respected list. It's the 'background music'. Every time BGM began, it pumped me up. My adrenaline rush felt amazing. It makes any car/bike enthusiast, respect their ride. I had some good cars and I'm missing them all so much right now. Returning back home from the movie, the music in my car was all the way to the sky and I sat for another few mins in the car even after reaching my destination. This is what the movie did to me.Peace out!",9,21,40,16 November 2019
Captain Marvel," My Review!
","Captain Marvel is a whole new branch in the Marvel industry and not directly connected to Avengers characters, much like Deadpool, Guardians of the Galaxy etc. Brie Larson did a good Captain Marvel. Loved her expressions! Many good surprises throughout the movie (seasoning on a pizza, i would say). The story could have been sharpened here and there (many felt the same). At times, the CGI felt more animated than CGI. Samuel L. Jackson brought all the fun with him. Loved him in every Marvel movie. Not sure if this is a big screen movie. It wasn't a complete entertainer as other Marvel movies were.Peace out!",6,1,2,29 August 2019
Zootopia," My Review!
","A pretty interesting take on the animal kingdom. The detail to every animal type of how they might be, if they started living like humans is just worthy of an applaud. One does not require animal behaviour knowledge to understand. A movie well made for both kids and adults. My review might be going technical for an animated movie. ;P So, go watch. It won't be a waste of time, I guarantee that.Peace Out!",8,2,2,29 August 2019
Creed," My Review!
","If this was the last flick in it's series of our Italian Stallion, I with a heavy heart say, 'I couldn't have asked for a better one'. Michael B Jordan did a fabulous job being a 'Creed'. This guy has been earning respect in some of the Hollywood movies and the best in the TV series The Wire. When you watch a Rocky movie, it's all about feeling, motivation and all the good stuff that inspires you to do some hard work in real life. Words merely cannot describe the love that I've have for Sylvester Stallone. Rocky movies admirers, Pl. do not watch this movie at home and instead hit the big screens. If you don't, you're NOT a Rocky fan.Peace Out!",8,0,0,29 August 2019
Aquaman," My Review!
","Aquaman, Let me put it this way, Wonder Woman - Rank 1, Aquaman - Rank 2, Batman V Superman - 3, Man of Steel - 4 and Justice League - 5. So, now you know this is a must watch.The storyline is pretty much a copy/paste from the animated world. So much is predictable. The CGI is pretty good (the designer might have got lazy here and there). I was blown away at how they managed to do a few things (won't say, it's a spoiler) and fit it so well in the storyline.Jason Momoa This huge beast is the best thing there is in the movie. The underwater CGI version of him is 8/10. Amber Heard'' did a pretty good come back.DC has pretty good characters but screenplay-writers, not all are great. It is clearly visible that the pressure from Marvel has made them rush. This did not end well for rank 3 and 5. WonderWoman and Aquaman are the key reason why DC is still afloat. Maybe, this says, DC should have done what Marvel did, story out each character and then fit them like Avengers. Justice League is this case.Peace Out!",8,0,3,29 August 2019
Deadpool 2," My Review!
","There is one thing about a Deadpool movie, the story leaves no doubts once the movie is over. Like, 'so what happened to this or that?, what happens next etc?'. There is no confusion in the air. It's just simple action and comedy. But I gotta say, it's not as interesting as the first one. Much crowd was laughing over scenes that weren't funny at all. Maybe because they thought, 'hey, we are watching a Deadpool movie, it's funny by default'. Story needed much fine tuning. Josh Brolin is a much better Thanos than Cable. Ryan Reynolds, this guy, MUST NOT EVER DIE. He is pure GOLD.Peace Out!",6,0,1,29 August 2019
Doctor Strange," My Review!
","This might be the least exciting movie in the marvel universe. It should've had at least a 3hr runtime because its all sorcery, magical stuff which would take us some time to understand. Many would've or might want to see this one because the storyline continues along with all the other marvel movies or excited to see Cumberbatch in action. Mine was, more of Cumberbatch. The animated version (2007) was a lot better than 2016 one.Extremely excited where all the marvel movies are heading to. :DPeace Out!",7,1,1,29 August 2019
Interstellar," My Review!
","Please please please DO watch this movie. I really wish to say more but if I gave away even a single hint accidentally, you would kill me!Peace Out!",9,0,1,29 August 2019
American Sniper," My Review!
","This is the true story of Chris Kyle. Unbeatable sniper marksman with a confirmed 160 kills during Iraq war. A character well portrayed via Bradley Cooper. Man, he beefed up in this. Can definitely watch more than once.Peace Out!",9,41,63,29 August 2019
Ant-Man," My Review!
","Finally watched the much awaited movie. It's not exactly avenger-ish, but you'll be surprised how little things can hit in a big way. The scripting is slightly confusing when compared to the original animated version. Of course, copy pasting exactly would be a bad idea, since the animated movies, tv series are more dramatised. It's alright to have few alterations. The important thing is, storyline was good and also graphics was excellent, characters played nicely, a strong avenger was portrayed. So yeah, this was a FANTASTIC movie. Hit the screens guys, you'll love it. Awaiting Captain America: Civil War Too bad it's next year. :(Peace Out!",8,0,0,29 August 2019
Justice League," My Review!
","I think this movie was a bit rushed. Most of the story was predictable. Some scenes could have been fast forwarded and most of the scenes could have had a bit more story. Although, the story-line was good, the acting was great, it just missed some sort of garnishing.I watched this in-spite of negative or neutral reviews from most I know because, c'mon, this is Justice League, how could you not watch this? So, don't hang around much for reviews and go for it.Peace out.",6,0,4,29 August 2019
Dunkirk," My Review!
","The hands of a perfectionist, Christopher Nolan could only have pulled off an intense true story based movie. You know you have seen a gripping movie when your heartbeat skips again and again. Many might find this dragging but make no mistake, this is a glimpse of WW2 and what happened to the souls that were in Dunkirk. It's the most respectable movie of 2017, yet. I'll definitely watch it again.
--During an actual screening,
'We had a screening for the veterans that I had spoken to, their families. Honestly, never felt quite such pressure in a professional setting as standing in front of that audience and about to, you know, show our version of what they'd actually lived through,' Nolan said.When 97-year-old war veteran Ken Sturdy attended the premiere of Christopher Nolan's 'Dunkirk' it was as if he stepped inside of a time capsule. So captivated by the film's depiction and stunningly accurate cinematography, Sturdy found himself back in 1940 on that very same French beach where the battle took place. 'It didn't have a lot of dialogue. It didn't need any of the dialogue because it told the story visually and it was so real,' the emotional war veteran told Canada's Global News.Peace Out!",9,0,2,29 August 2019
Pearl Harbor," My Review!
","One of the best movies ever made. Every time I watch it, it touches my heart. A beautiful balance of love, friendship, patriotism. The actors/actresses, background music, sound effects. Love it all.Peace Out!",9,5,8,29 August 2019
Inside Out," My Review!
","Combining the brilliant minds of Disney & Pixar gives results like this one, I wish them all the success in bringing such beautiful movies in time to come. An interesting portray of how a human thinks and acts to surroundings right from birth. This is by far the most realistic approach of human nature via an animated movie. Many might not like the idea of watching an animated movie but if you'll just give it a shot, I bet you'll love it. It's WORTH IT.Peace Out!",9,1,2,29 August 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," My Review!
","This one is a 'kickass'. The one even the celebrities would line up to watch. It releases the inner child in you and let it, it feels good. ;) If you haven't seen Captain America series, Iron Man series, Thor series, Guardians of the Galaxy series, Avengers series, Black Panther, Doctor Strange, this movie is not going to make sense. Watch them all and then hit the BIG screen. :)Peace Out!",9,0,1,29 August 2019
The Theory of Everything," My Review!
","You know life is good when there are such beautiful movies. I've always assumed Stephen Hawking as a man who is really really serious in nature and goodness I was wrong. All those who're interested in knowing a bit about who he is, I reckon this movie would be the best way to describe him. Well played Eddie Redmayne. You won an Oscar, anything less, is injustice. Well directed, James Marsh.Peace Out!",9,0,1,29 August 2019
X-Men: Apocalypse," My Review!
","If I was to describe this movie in a single word, it would be 'Boring'. James McAvoy would be the only reason if this movie is going to be a hit. Apocalypse was such a goodie goodie villain. I'll be dumbstruck if it touches USD 1 billion as of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Some surprises here and there, but nothing new.Single X-men character focussed movies as Wolverine, Deadpool etc., would be the only way to save X-men characters from vanishing and probably join the Avengers. And also, If these X-men characters would generate thrill and excitement, maybe just maybe, X-men movies could plan on coming back. But for now, think they should take a backseat.Peace Out!",6,0,2,29 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," My Review!
","Being able to feel nostalgic is one of the best feeling there is. In this case, this movie. The story is a wonderful combination of everything that we have seen and today's generation graphics. It all blends so well. There are a lot of things that I miss from the original trilogy, but nevertheless, the actor's, the graphics, the sound effects have done a fantastic job of keeping the undying OST alive and all that comes along with it. ðŸ™‚Peace out!",7,2,21,29 August 2019
Jurassic World," My Review!
","This is a perfect example of an action adventure movie. Much better than it's predecessors. A new story, fresh out of the box in it's series. You might not feel the complete effect of the movie if not watched in theatre. This is a great watch for both Jurassic Park series followers and first timers. I'm definitely watching this again.P.S: Those who cannot handle few scary bloody scenes, pl. do not go for it. Noticed at least a few with kids leaving the movie half way.Peace Out!",9,0,1,29 August 2019
Uri: The Surgical Strike," My Review!
","URI The Surgical Strike India said, 'Enough is Enough'. The movie is based upon (no spoilers here), the return slap to Terrorism.This flick, what JOSH. Vicky Kaushal, his acting, KICKASS. The background music (throughout) pulls you right into the movie. Bollywood is developing a new recipe for it's movies which are more true events, story etc. based. This I respect (and love it). Please-please, do not make the mistake of watching it on tv, screening at home-theatre / society etc. You'll miss the strong, powerful vibes it gives.CGI - 7/10. This will take a bit of time. But we have come a long way. Things are definitely speeding up.Peace Out!",9,0,0,29 August 2019
Logan," My Review!
","Over the past few days, I've been seeing and commenting on Blogs about who could replace Hugh Jackman as 'The Wolverine'. With a pinch of Salt, I've been saying, 'Tom Hardy'. He has the physique, the acting abilities etc and then, I saw 'Logan'. Deep, emotional flick this. It is in no way a classic Wolverine movie. It's surpassed that. Hugh Jackman, the man, 'The Wolverine'. IRREPLACEABLE!!! Next is, the character 'Laura'. That kid, the depth in her eyes, spoke a lot. In many ways, she was over shadowing Hugh Jackman. Seriously, FOR REAL. At that moment, I was like, Tom hardy, respectfully can take a backseat and let 'Laura' take over as 'The Wolverine'.There are no end credit scenes in this movie. Many say, after the trailers and the movie begins, there is a pre-credit scene. I was right there sitting even before the trailers began and came across no credit scenes. I saw it online while typing this. Maybe it differs from Country to Country.Peace Out!",9,1,2,29 August 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," My Review!
","The movie is great for people who've a bit of experience of it's early cartoon characters. I tried explaining a few things to a few but then I was just sounding stupid. For people who haven't watched the cartoon series, don't let my comment on the same turn you off. The graphics are a kicker, the character's have played well, all round, great work. Worth a watch. I might watch it again.P.S: Personally, I liked Avengers (film) 1 more.Peace Out!",7,0,0,29 August 2019
Invictus," My Review!
","Such an inspiration. The role played as Nelson Mandela by Morgan Freeman was a beautiful one. Touched.

Edge of Tomorrow," My Review!
","Tom and Emily, that's a good combo. Though the whole of movie was lacking details of Alien existence, the suit they wearing, how and why it began etc. They do show a bit of details, but not enough. How they scored a 8.1 on imdb, no idea. Anyways, felt good to watch a sci-fi movie once a while.Peace Out!",6,0,1,29 August 2019
Kong: Skull Island," My Review!
","Why would someone make another King Kong movie? Sometimes, it's better to make once or max twice of the same character's story and let it be. If you make more, it doesn't turn out to be a movie anymore. It clearly looks like a competition of who's story, graphics, actors are better and we end up wasting time and money.The height of Kong, the way he walks make him look like a Bigfoot. Bigfoot(s) as the monster(s) on an unchartered Island would have made a better story. The graphics were more of the 90's. The storyline had so many goof ups that it was noticeable the very first time you see the movie. The 2005 King Kong movie, simply 'Wow'. IMDB agrees with me. This is what i would carry on as the story of King Kong and pray that another Kong movie is never made.It's watchable once or maybe not.Peace out!",5,0,3,29 August 2019
Black Panther," My Review!
","After months, i finally see a movie on the big screen. Maybe my first in 2018.Black Panther my favourite superhero on the big screen. Feels fantastic. The storyline is simple. Might be the most simplest Marvel story ever made. The energy of every character is truly beyond words. The tech, graphics, sound effects, ooo - I love the background songs / music. Many must have thought, who this 'Black Panther' is and where did he come from while watching Captain America: Civil War (2016 film). Now, this is your chance to understand the Wakandan's.Peace Out!",9,1,5,29 August 2019
Creed II," My Review!
","Creed 2 gives a punch better than its predecessor. This one has many real life based situations that blends in so nicely with a Boxing plot movie. When real-life based situations and/or true-life based story are shown, it (mostly) tends to slow the pace of the movie. But nevertheless, this is a heart touching movie and must be viewed only on the big screen. If you do miss it, do a Amazon Prime / Netflix etc. The boxing side of the movie is action-packed and lives upto the title of Rocky series. This flick has a direct connection to Rocky IV and it's connected well even-though the gap is approx. 33 years.Michael B Jordan has come up real fast in his career and is unstoppable. He nails every movie / tv series he has acted in. He is one the stars to whom I say, 'the future of Hollywood seems secure'. Sylvester Stallone must be proud that he has Michael carrying on the mantle.The contender debut in Hollywood is strong and I think he might have a few projects coming at him, soon.Peace Out!",7,0,1,29 August 2019
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," My Review!
","I'm not sure many are going to like this movie. The movie was too rushed. Background music, a bit too loud. Too dramatical. Originality of certain scenes made this movie too good to be true. I would certainly watch it again. But maybe skip a few scenes.Many general audience not knowing the character, Wonder Woman, will have a tough time figuring out her role. An individual movie will be helpful. Gal Gadot did a fine job as Diana Prince but as Wonder Woman, not so great. A bit more muscular female artist should've been picked.Superman, man I fall in love with this guy every time I see him. He looks exactly what the comics show us.Lex Luthor, I don't recall him being so small since the beginning of Superman comics. Not very impactive. I've huge respect for Jesse Eisenberg but as Lex Luthor, he did not fit the bill. Needs to be replaced with someone else, if I may be bold to say so.Batman, nailed it. He looked exactly the way BATMAN is suppose to be. Experienced, balanced as Bruce Wayne and Son of Gotham, not too gadgety, raw look, the anger, the calculated risks, determination etc. Even his bat mobile was spot on. He scored a point over Christian Bale from The Dark Knight series, I would say.PEACE OUT!",6,1,6,29 August 2019
Deadpool," My Review!
","I've absolutely no idea why the censor board have tagged this movie 'A' rated. There are certain 'A' words which are uncensored and certain beeped. If you're planning to show an 'A' rated movie and we know that it's 'A' rated and we are okay watching/listening then why censor the scenes, beep the words? It's just a poor poor way of making an amazing movie look dull.Anyways, this is a must watch. Ryan Reynolds beautiful beautiful actor. Thank goodness he is not a Green Lantern. Dead pool is way better. But beware guys, its an 'A' rated movie. ;)Peace Out!",9,0,1,29 August 2019
Kingsman: The Secret Service," My Review!
","Casting some of the drama / serious oscar winners, you automatically tend to think that it will be one of those serious super spy action flick. But, it gave a twist I never thought would be possible with the cast. This is by far one of the best comedy spy flicks ever made. Imagine all the serious actor's given a bit of humorous scripting to play with? Although, not sure if it deserved to be in the top 250 imdb best movies list. Anyways, I would definitely watch it again. :)Peace Out!",8,2,2,29 August 2019

","HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAFamily movie, Kid's and Adults laughed their guts out. lol.Peace Out!",8,0,0,29 August 2019
Spectre," My Review!
","This was a bit boring and an exciting movie. The uncommon background music in a James Bond movie was highly disturbing, throughout. The ladies were old and dull faced. Mind you, amazing actors. But it's losing it's grip. The bad guys acted amazing but had pretty slow and boring character roles. Overall, I didn't like it much but when kept the thrill we seek in a JB movie aside, this was fantastic. I know, I'm a bit this side and a bit the other. You'll understand if you've seen it or about to. :)Peace out!",7,0,0,29 August 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," My Review!
",This was definitely the best upgrade of the late 1980's Mad Max Trilogy. It's action filled with mild topping of comedy. It is definitely an A+. Highly recommended. Tom Hardy always reminds of the character Bane in The Dark Knight RisesPeace Out!,9,1,4,29 August 2019
The Martian," My Review!
","It takes a lot of theoretical knowledge to conceptualise a movie that's based on Mars and oh boy, they've nailed it (i think). The Combination of graphics, hard work and sheer acting experience of Matt Damon brought life to this beautiful movie, The Martian. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly insist you do. Most of the physics stuff might be a bit over the head, but the simplicity of words used in scripting might just give you a fair picture of what is going on.P.S
If you're planning to watch this one on TV or computer, probably not a good idea!Peace Out!",8,1,2,29 August 2019
