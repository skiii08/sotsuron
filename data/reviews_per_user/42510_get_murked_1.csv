Love and Death," Woody's Funniest... So Far
","I am seventeen years old and have seen about 25 of Woody Allen's films. Although I enjoy his most acclaimed works very much('Annie Hall', 'Manhattan') , I must say that the funniest I've seen so far is 'Love and Death.' From start to finish, this is Woody's funniest, mainly do to the great amount of historical jokes that take a few viewings to be absorbed completely.One of my favorite lines is when Woody and the rest of the Russian soldiers are on their way to the first battle and the topic of who should run the country comes up.After one man says that the Jewish should lead Russia, Allen says that he has no real problem with this, except for the fact that, 'I hear that their women don't believe in sex after marriage.' This is a truly underrated comedy classic. ****1/2 0f ******",Null,1,1,13 April 2004
