Scarface," Scarface: a movie about excess
","Having watched this movie several times before, I have admittedly dismissed it as a 'senseless action packed wanna-be gangster' action movie. I have come to realise that it really is much more than that. The theme of the movie is excess, which is brilliantly portrayed in many ways: the cinematography, acting and the clothes. What I missed when watching this previously was Tony Montana's attitude towards communism and how deliberate his quest for capitalism in form of the 'American Dream' despite a lack of understanding of either concept. What is commonly misunderstood in this 'rags to riches' movie is that the real capitalism is Tony working as a dishwasher, not a drug lord. Elvira, his wife, represents everything what Tony wants but cant have. Her indifference and dullness showcases how taking shortcuts to fortune will leave you feeling empty inside, as a 'loser, not a winner'. The protagonist, Tony Montana is a bullish, angry and hungry persona. Although we only see glimpses of his relationships, they really tell the whole story. His mother is ashamed of him whilst his sister becomes progressively resentful towards him. He knew this life would have a cost but he didn't think respect would be it. In my opinion, he is 'the bad guy' only because he is ashamed of how his family has isolated him. His loneliness translates into paranoia to protect his wealth, the last thing which he thinks people respect him for. He is well liked for 'telling it as it is', but that isn't enough on its own, as this is what got him killed in the end. What really resonated with me was the illusion of success that these drug lords think they possess; Tony constantly references his 'hard work' as if he really started as a dishwasher and worked his way up. The excess materialism is a result of chasing people's respect, but in the end nobody cares what you have, but how you got it. To summarise, Scarface is a clever movie teaching us that cutting corners will leave you empty, the real American dream is washing dishes forever and if momma ain't happy ain't nobody happy!",9,0,0,12 November 2017
