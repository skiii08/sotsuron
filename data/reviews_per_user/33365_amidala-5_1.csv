Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The critics are just jealous......
","First of all, I'm going to say right up front that I loved the movie. It was wonderfully done, and it provided a refreshing change from the other recent movies, which all seem to be mindlessly violent. And I will now reveal my opinion on a controversial subject that will probably earn hatred from others. I LOVED JAR JAR! Yes, Jar Jar, instead of being a racist stereotype, turned out to be a great character. My little sisters, ages 9 and 5, absolutely love him, as did I. All child-oriented characters, like Barney and such, get a bad rap because... they're cute. Now that's sad, that just because a character is made to appeal to children, adults ridicule it.That just goes to show that our society is going seriously downhill amid a torrent of adult themes. So, back to the movie, I thought the plot was nifty, as were the special effects. The only thing I have to disagree with is the portrayal of Anakin Skywalker by Jake Lloyd.It's not that Jake's not a great actor, it's just that he's too cute. Too sweet and innocent. Audiences, I think, are going to have a hard time accepting that this adorable angel with become the epitome of evil.Anakin should have been portrayed with more of that darker side, the flaw that will ultimatly lead him to the dark side.Altogether , though, it was great! I've seen it 3 times now, and each time I've left the movie theater in thrilled shock.The dual between the Jedi and Maul got me on the edge of my seat.The glimpses of Theed and the view from the Jedi Council were both breathtaking. The Midi-Chlorian concept, however, left my father and aunt, who are both cell biologists, speechless with laughter at what they thought was a ludicrous concept. I say, this is the best movie I've seen all year!",10,7,9,14 July 1999
