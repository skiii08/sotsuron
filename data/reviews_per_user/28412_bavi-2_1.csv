The Rock," Lots of A-Dime-A-Dozen Makeovers, Killed the Charm of this Magnificent Action Movie
","When I first saw 'The Rock' at the theaters, I said to myself, 'wow! that's one nasty movie' The action sequences were swirling, the dialogues were smart and sharp, and the soundtrack was a musical masterpiece! All those things went through my mind before I witnessed Nicolas Cage's post-'The Rock' career, which included really lousy films like 'Con Air' and 'Snake Eyes'... and that was the first time I saw John Spencer as Womack (sure, his various characters are'nt named 'Womack', but hell, he plays the same role over and over again!). the same goes for the rest of this film's supporting cast, which is reincarnating itslef in almost ever Jerry Bruckheimer productions. The editing, the dialogues, the characters, the soundtrack and sometimes even the plot appear in every single action movie that is out at the theaters today... 'The Rock' was so powerful at his time, that he stained the whole genre of action films, which makes these films, including 'The Rock' hard to watch these days, only four years after the premiere...",8,3,3,12 September 2000
