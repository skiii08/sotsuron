Despicable Me 2," Silly, funny, and always entertaining.
","A silly, funny and always entertaining movie with plenty of laughs and humorous moments. Takes a while to get going and the story's nothing special, but the characters, colourful graphics and minions make the film a joy to watch.",8,0,0,13 October 2018
The Avengers," A grand spectacle
","The grandeur of the spectacle and the fantastic special effects are worth it alone; this film is excellent in every way. It does take a while to get going, but the characters and story work well together and it manages to balance the egos, humour, action and human aspects of it excellently.",9,1,2,12 October 2018
Blade Runner 2049," Spectacular, but feels as though it's lacking something.
","A spectacular sci-fi tale with a strong atmosphere and commitment to its impressive artistic style and futuristic setting. The acting and story is good and will keep your interest, but the meandering pace and focus on style left it cold in parts. 
Some bits of the plot don't quite add up and it feels as though it's lacking something, as is the (almost) requirement to have pre-knowledge of the first film. I did like the characters and the topics the plot covers.",8,3,7,12 October 2018
First Man," A very human approach to the story behind one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind
","A very human approach to the story behind one of the greatest accomplishments of mankind, as it focuses almost exclusively on Neil Armstrong's journey. Strong acting and style throughout, as it is filmed with an old style and almost in a documentary format. Great use of effects and atmosphere when in the space capsules and on the Moon but because of the level of detail included, as it goes through the process and setbacks they encountered, it is a bit slow at times.",8,16,38,12 October 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Much better than the first Hulk, but never ascends to greatness.
","Good score, action scenes and slower, romantic scenes but as with any action monster movie, the special effects are the main attraction. The story didn't play out as I expected, the Hulk seemed too cartoony in bits, and some parts were laugh out loud bad. Although a sequel, watching the poorer original not required to fully enjoy it.",8,2,4,13 October 2018
Iron Man 3," More about the human than the superhero, but entertaining and thrilling throughout
","More about the human than the superhero, the film is entertaining throughout with a barmy plot that has plenty of tongue in cheek moments, and plenty of explosive action scenes. No truly great moments stand out and Stark is as arrogant as ever, but it thrills and entertains right to the credits.",8,1,1,12 October 2018
It," A modern masterpiece of storytelling
","A modern masterpiece of storytelling with a great 80's setting, atmosphere and use of musical pieces. Strong acting and characters who develop through the great story of giving in to and overcoming their fears. Plenty of creepy horror, iconic and shocking scenes, and a good balance of frights based on real-world and imaginary threats. Top special effects and disturbing imagery which taps into the character's emotions and themes of the time.",9,0,1,12 October 2018
John Wick," A rather boring action revenge movie with minimal plot and a 'matter of fact' presentation
",". The sophisticated style and exclusive hidden world is used well and Reeves suits the lead role, but the action scenes are repetitive and uninspired, and overall, the film doesn't really engage.",4,2,4,17 May 2019
Rocketman," Elton John's biopic in musical form, the story of which came across as a little bit clichÃ©.
","Although there's plenty of great music, upbeat numbers and entertaining dance routines, there's also a fair bit of emotional trauma and drama, making the presentation tonally all over the place. Great performances from Edgerton and Bell throughout, but it left me feeling cold in the end.",6,0,1,22 September 2019
A Star Is Born," Thoroughly enjoyable.
","A modern take on a classic story which is still magnificent to experience today. Cooper and Gaga get to show off all of their singing, acting and directing talents to great effect, with great songs, strong acting and real screen presence. The story has plenty of romance, drama and excitement as well as being funny and emotional at times, but because of the snappy editing and lots of musical performances, it does feel like a 'behind the scenes on tour' film at times.",8,2,7,28 September 2018
The Maze Runner," Promising concept, but ultimately a let down.
","Although the concept is promising, the plot feels cobbled together and the explanations it gives simply don't satisfy the audience's curiosity. Some of the acting is good and shows real emotion, but the characters and their traits are typical and predictable. The monster chase and action scenes look good due to the special effects rather than the dark and shaky camera work that is employed.",5,0,0,12 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Another great entry into the Star Wars franchise
","Although the plot is familiar, takes a while to get going and ends rather abruptly, the rest of the film more than makes up for it with great special effects, attention to detail, and plenty of sci-fi action scenes. Strong acting and the new set of characters keep it fresh whilst trying to show a slightly different side to the saga.",8,1,3,13 October 2018
Captain Marvel," Another good addition to the Marvel movie roster, but it won't blow you away.
","The plot has a good pace and structure to it, with enough depth to keep you interested, and also has a good amount of light hearted and emotional moments. The action scenes and special effects are great and it has a really good 90's nostalgic setting, but some of the acting is a bit flat and there isn't a real sense of danger, as the villains have a lesser role to play.",7,1,4,8 March 2019
Us," Modern horror just isn't scary.
","A more intelligently made slasher movie, although the big reveal doesn't make a bit of sense. It's quite artistic in presentation and the acting's good, but there's never any sense of fear or horror, and it's very slow in the beginning in setting the scene. It kept my interest, but the story just wasn't that good.",5,5,10,22 March 2019
Knives Out," Marvelous, wonderful, quirky, funny, superb. A real gem of a movie.
","A wonderful murder mystery whodunit with a great plot which has plenty of good twists and turns that will keep you guessing right up until the end. The writing is funny and quirky, the acting and cast performances are great, and although it does labour the explanation phase a bit, it's a marvelous production overall.",9,2,8,30 November 2019
Aquaman," Probably the worst superhero film I've seen in a long while.
","The film is formulaic and derivative with few redeeming features. The plot is weak, predictable and dull with no sense of threat, and the few moments of awe or surprise are fleeting. There's a variety of settings and scenes, but they all end in the same way. The special effects are mostly sub-par, and the costumes look cheap and tacky. The acting is good, but there's no real character development and the forced humour is awful.",3,35,74,15 December 2018
Deadpool 2," An entertaining if somewhat disappointing sequel.
","There's plenty of visually great action scenes and there's plenty of quips and jokes, but a lot of these are forced and the plot is all over the place tonally. The new characters are ok, but water down the experience and although it may be Deadpool's style, the language and carnage seemed to be done just for the sake of it a few times. Still a good movie, but the best has gone before, and recycling something that was fresh and fun doesn't always work second time around.",6,0,2,28 September 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," A different approach to the recent superhero genre, focusing on comedy and comic book style action and banter.
","The plot doesn't flow particularly well and although the cast and acting are good, the new characters are hit and miss, much like the large number of jokes. Most of the jokes are forced and detract from the events in the plot, but some of the comical scenes are great. The action scenes look superb, as do the 2 very different settings, but overall, the film never truly hooked me.",6,2,4,12 October 2018
Ready Player One," Superb fun
","A superb family action adventure movie full of spectacular special effects and tons of video game and pop culture references. Exciting and thrilling, but also heartwarming and comical thanks to the great cast, likeable characters and moral messages. Entertaining throughout, the plot initially seems a bit simple as it follows video game logic, but there's a lot more to it and with something always going on, it's never boring. It's not perfect - the villain is a bit of a letdown and it drags a bit at the end, but it is a visual treat and relatively topical with the ever growing and ever-changing gamer culture.",10,1,4,28 September 2018
Moana," A superb Disney animation with a strong story, great songs and plenty of good jokes.
","Colourful and imaginative in its wonderful cultural setting with a great cast of characters, it has enough self-awareness to keep things relevant whilst still maintaining the traditional Disney format. A bit repetitive in the songs and moral messages, but otherwise great.",9,0,2,22 September 2019
BlacKkKlansman," Timely, relevant, humorous and sickening.
","A timely and relevant true story which although long and meandering, makes plenty of good points along the way. The film shows both sides of the conflict and how many people can approach the same problem from different ways with varying levels of success. It manages to contain both humorous and sickening scenes, but thanks to the great acting and cast of characters, stays entertaining throughout. I felt the ending was a bit underwhelming, although the modern day real life footage was chilling to see.",7,2,7,27 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun, entertaining and funny.
","A fun and entertaining film full of jokes, a great character development arc, and realistic (but still comic book) villain. Top special effects with exciting action scenes throughout with a plot which has a good balance of personal involvement and superhero antics. Good acting and the continuous referrals to the Avengers series works well, but the range of new characters vary in suitability, and the plot is a bit too straightforward overall.",9,0,2,12 October 2018
Suicide Squad," Not that fun or enjoyable to watch.
","With a weak, cobbled together story and a slow, by the numbers start, this film just isn't that fun or enjoyable to watch, although there are some good moments and ideas. The two main Squad members (Deadshot & Harley Quinn) are great to watch thanks to the strong characterisation and acting, but the rest of the characters feel underdeveloped and in some cases, completely unnecessary. There is good use of popular music in some of the scenes, but this becomes tiresome by the end of the film. The special effects are good, but many of the action scenes are too dark and this obscures the action.",3,0,0,13 October 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Another entertaining superhero outing with a great cast of characters and excellent special effects.
","The plot gets too muddled up by trying to be both relevant to modern audiences and true to its own lore, but the balance of action and the few light moments keep it enjoyable and well-paced.",8,0,0,12 October 2018
Doctor Strange," Visually spectacular, strong acting, and a good plot.
","Visually spectacular throughout with fantastic, colourful and imaginative special effect sequences and fight scenes which are both acrobatic and full of illusionary effects. Strong acting and a good plot which is evenly paced, but the characters and story felt too typical and familiar. Plenty of light touches and thrilling scenes keep it enjoyable, but the big villain at the end was very bland, and the love story felt too underdeveloped.",8,2,2,12 October 2018
Interstellar," Epic and spectacular, but with major plot mis-steps.
","An epic and spectacular journey that after its slow start allows the audience to marvel at the wonder and awe-inspiring aspects of space exploration. However, the plot missteps significantly in the second half before losing itself almost entirely to cater for a nice and tidy Hollywood happy ending. The strong acting and characters deliver enough science and human interest to keep the audience involved, but ultimately, the film runs on too long and doesn't spend enough time up in space.",7,0,0,13 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Good, but too similar to previous films in the saga.
","A good sci-fi action adventure movie but still too similar to what has gone before and for a finale, I was expecting it to be more epic. The story flits between various locations quickly and is often followed by action scenes which means there's always something to watch and be entertained by, but the plot itself is rather light. More depth to the locations and characters would have been nice, but there are just enough reveals and new aspects to keep you interested. The acting, special effects and action scenes are good but not spectacular, and although the iconic music's still there, the imagery and impact of the struggle wasn't this time around.",7,1,4,23 December 2019
Ant-Man," A formulaic and entertaining superhero movie that lacks the spectacular set pieces of the other Marvel blockbusters
","A formulaic and entertaining superhero movie that lacks the spectacular set pieces of the other Marvel blockbusters, and focuses too much on tying it into the Avengers movies instead of letting it stand by itself. Lighter and comical in tone, it manages to lack substance whilst it rushes through the origin and future of the character. Good acting, but the characters are dull and the villain is woefully underutilised.",6,1,2,12 October 2018
21 Jump Street," Good fun and funny too.
","Entertainingly fun and funny with a good cast, great acting and a good story. The relationship between the stars really works and the light hearted hijinks make it difficult not to enjoy their escapades. Not that original, but well put together and the comedy and jokes are great.",8,0,0,31 March 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Good
","A good 'feel-good' superhero movie with a retro style which knows not to take itself too seriously, and when to pile on the strong comic book action. The montages and silliness of certain scenes only slightly hamper the good story and acting, allowing the adventure, explosions, and one-liners to keep you entertained and cheery to the end.",8,1,2,12 October 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," A great performance, but not a great biopic.
","There's a lot of great elements in this film - the music, the performances, the acting, and the creativity and showmanship of Queen and Freddie Mercury is spectacular. It's entertaining throughout and held my interest as I learnt some new and interesting facts behind their biggest hits. However, as a biopic, it's not so great, as it skips over a lot of the other albums and the story ends at the Live Aid performance. It also doesn't really say or show you anything new about Freddie's life or the other members of Queen.",7,2,7,26 October 2018
Justice League," A solid performance that does well with each of the new characters it introduces.
","The action scenes are impressive to watch and the film successfully balances the lighter side of superheroes with the darker tone and setting of the series. The main villain is a bit bland, the characters could have been more developed and the one liners were pretty awful, but it stays entertaining throughout and never gets too bogged down in lore or meaningless action scenes.",7,3,4,13 October 2018
Man of Steel," Very dramatic and destructive with a much darker, more serious tone
","Although the film is slightly too long, it is still an epic and emotional tale of Superman realising his destiny, telling a familiar yet different story to the previous films. The music and special effects are fantastic, but the characters and style make it feel very familiar to recent blockbusters.",8,2,3,13 October 2018
The Revenant," A great film spoiled by being far too long for its straightforward story of survival and revenge.
","The film is brutal in its depiction of the harsh climate and savagery of man, but could have done with some scene setting or explanation of the era. Good usage of scenery and special effects, and strong acting throughout.",8,1,3,13 October 2018
Split," Creepy and disturbing, but doesn't quite manage to build the tension effectively.
","A creepy and disturbing horror movie with dark sub-plots and an interesting study into multiple personality disorder, but it doesn't quite manage to build up the tension effectively. McAvoy is truly great as the lead role in his variety of guises, but I wish we had seen a greater range of personalities. Strong acting, but the plot is nothing special and it lacks a memorable or shocking finale.",7,0,1,12 October 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," An intense and colourful adventure featuring a fresh-ish take on a classic character.
","It's basically like watching a comic come to life on the big screen - superb animation, over the top action scenes, zany characters and comic book style and humour. However, with so much going on, lots of psychedelic colours and flashing lights combined with a 3D effect, it was a bit too much at times. The story is good and although different, still quite familiar and a bit too long and heavy handed with the morals. I would have liked to see more of the other Spiders and more of the other villains.",8,5,41,9 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A great spy adventure
","A great spy adventure with lots of thrilling stunts and set pieces, novel gadgets and an interesting plot full of misdirection. Entertaining throughout thanks to its top stunts, well placed comical moments, strong characters and throw backs to the source material. Some parts are too cliché and it does slow down too much when there isn't excitement on screen, but it's still a lot of fun.",9,1,1,12 October 2018
Dunkirk," Gripping and powerful
","A gripping and powerful depiction of survival and overcoming adversity on a grand scale when everything is at its worst. Realistic and authentic action scenes with haunting images that tell more than lengthy dialogue ever could. The musical score is used to great effect, building up the suspense and tension during the calm and the storm. Great acting and a good balance of different perspectives, showing the heroism of those involved right up to the film's emotional ending.",10,1,2,13 October 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man," Not really amazing, but a good alternative interpretation of the Spider-Man story
","Not really amazing, but a good alternative interpretation of the Spider-Man story which is different enough to remain interesting. Having a greater focus on science and teen angst makes it awkward to watch in parts, but the top special effects, excellent set pieces, and emotional investment of the characters is well worth it.",8,1,1,13 October 2018
X-Men: Days of Future Past," As expected, another great performance filled with top stars, fantastic special effects, and a fitting atmosphere.
","Although it goes a bit overboard in the final act, the story is more emotionally invested than usual whilst still being comic book like in nature and scale. The top cast of big stars perform their roles well and the superb special effects keep the action flowing and the film entertaining throughout.",9,0,0,13 October 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Good, entertaining fun.
","Suffers from too many heroes and is slow to start, but it keeps the right balance of light hearted action and emotional stakes of the franchise. This is mostly thanks to the characters, their individual reasons for being involved, and their well-suited actors. Top notch special effects and exciting scenes abound, but the story seems repetitive to the previous instalments at times.",8,0,1,12 October 2018
Yesterday," A funny and feel good 'what if' story, if lacking in originality and real magic.
","A good 'what if' story filled with plenty of great music, although it doesn't really explore the premise beyond the basics. It's funny and feel good at times as it explores the ups and downs of trying to make it in the music business and the relationship development is good because of the strong acting from the leads. Not as original or funny as it could have been, and some of the supporting cast and cameos felt a bit too much, but enjoyable nonetheless.",8,1,3,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," An epic and emotional end to a fantastic saga of superheroes.
","Funny, emotional, surprising, and worth the wait. The 3 hours flew by, and i enjoyed every minute of it. More nostalgic than i was expecting, but great nonetheless.",10,0,4,1 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Still great and enjoyable, but has lost some of it's magic over time.
","A more emotional and poignant adventure featuring everyone's favorite toys which, although still very entertaining, isn't as much fun. There are funny moments and the action and animation is always superb, but it doesn't have the same style or magic of the other films in the series. Overall, it feels as though it was made for adults who grew up with the series rather than children, but with a slightly more modern take on the humour.",8,1,4,21 June 2019
Batman Begins," Too many special effects and not enough story or acting.
","Let's hope The Dark Knight relies more on story, acting and 'Darkness' than special effects like this one!",8,0,2,13 October 2018
Non-Stop," A really enjoyable action thriller
","A really enjoyable action thriller with good special effects and acting, but is cheesy in parts, and the convoluted sequence of events and justification for the hijacking could have been much better. More should have been done to increase the tension in the (potentially) claustrophobic setting instead of just focusing on the flawed hero.",8,1,1,13 October 2018
The Favourite," A quirky and peculiar presentation, with some very artistic moments and some very bizarre moments.
","Strong acting from the leads as they suffer tragedy and frivolity, although the story isn't that great overall. Great use of the expensive historical setting, with extravagance always on show, and the music manages to be both beautiful and haunting.",7,2,3,4 January 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," A perfect popcorn movie
","A perfect popcorn movie - sit back, put the brain into neutral and enjoy the rollercoaster of spectacular set pieces in exotic locales. The story is old and weak, and the characters don't have much depth, but there are plenty of light moments and a nail-biting finale.",8,3,4,12 October 2018
It Follows," It takes a special kind of talent to make a movie about a terrifying and malevolent supernatural force boring, but this manages to.
","The concept is good - the constant fear and unease of something that's always out to get you, something which can strike at any time, but in this case, it doesn't hold up to any scrutiny or make a very engaging film. It does have an interesting and artistic camera style and setting, which builds up an uneasy atmosphere, but it's never scary or tense. The acting and character's aren't great, the creature itself isn't menacing, and the basic story and slow pace just makes it boring.",2,3,4,3 March 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off
","An epic undertaking on a massive scale that definitely pays off - it successfully combines each of the characters (and their franchises) together well, weaving them into a new story which they can all (almost equally) partake in. Visually it is superb with excellent special effects and settings throughout, and there is the right amount of humour spread across the characters. The plot transitions from the different group of heroes well, and manages to balance the story with the action - the slower, emotional scenes often have the same impact as the large scale and explosive actions scenes. However, the same criticisms of the Marvel series of movies are still there - the heroes are thrown about seemingly to no consequence, the plot just trundles along at times with little respite, and some of the fight scenes are so quick so you can't see the action.",9,0,1,28 September 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Brilliantly made, but takes a long time to get where its going.
","An overly indulgent love letter to the late 60's American movie business that takes a long time to get going, but is worth it in the end. Meticulously crafted in setting and style with great acting and a good cast of characters, it held my interest throughout, although I was wondering what the point of it was for a long time. Cleverly put together with plenty of colour and good music and although the ending was funny, it does feel rather unnecessary.",9,2,4,16 August 2019
Django Unchained," Stylish, bloody and violent
","Stylish, bloody and violent, it's Tarantino's style through and through, with a relatively straightforward story of love and triumph over slavery. It feels too long in parts and is too 'black and white' in parts, but the larger than life characters and stylish exits make it humorous and entertaining.",9,1,4,13 October 2018
Get Out," A serviceable and entertaining horror film
","A serviceable and entertaining horror film with some sinister moments and some funny moments. Very predictable story and events, as the almost immediate awkwardness from the characters gives a lot of the mystery away, but there are still some good clues and a tidy, if somewhat convenient, ending. I think it should have done more with the imagery, psychological mind games and potentially deep-rooted racism aspects of the plot.",6,0,1,12 October 2018
Aladdin," Just as enjoyable, fun and entertaining as the original
","Enjoyable, fun and entertaining throughout with some great songs, great special effects, good acting and a classic story which moves at the right pace. Although it's pretty much a blow by blow remake of the original, there are some new songs and modern additions which work well and although it all ends a bit too neatly, it is a superb production.",9,21,71,23 May 2019
The Lion King," The best looking Disney remake to date, but definitely not the best remake.
","The power ballads lack power, the lion characters all look too similar, and the singing and talking animals are jarring. It lacks fun when it should be funny, and the story isn't that great either. It's a visual teat from start to finish, but you're probably better off watching the original for the best experience.",5,0,2,21 July 2019
A Quiet Place," Tense and shocking
","Tense and shocking with a story that doesn't hold its punches and doesn't go on for too long. The great creature effects and use of sound add to the horror and the emotional bond between the family members seems genuine. There are a few little inconsistencies and the lack of explanation is annoying, but otherwise, it's a great film.",9,2,4,28 September 2018
Unknown," The Bourne Identity, but with Liam Neeson
","The Bourne Identity, but with Liam Neeson being the hard hitting amnesiac assassin... again. A boring story due to being unbelievable, predictable and slow paced, but solid acting and well put together action scenes and localisation. Nothing new, but entertaining with some exciting scenes.",Null,1,2,13 October 2018
X-Men: Apocalypse," Too long in parts, but it all comes together well to an epic and entertaining superhero movie.
","The plot isn't up to much as it focuses on destruction rather than reason, and the setting isn't as strong as it should have been. Although the special effects look good, the film relies too much on them towards the end, but the wide range of well-acted characters keep you involved.",7,0,3,12 October 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Entertaining and comical, but doesn't tie up all the story threads well.
","Lots of threads that don't quite all come together completely, but still manage to make an entertaining superhero action move with great cartoony special effects and comical tone and themes from the comic. The film does labour on the love story and the characters are stereotypical without much depth given to them. It tries not to repeat the elements from the previous films too heavily, but doesn't stand out as a great film, although parts of it are very good.",7,0,1,13 October 2018
1917," Definitely worth watching, but felt too staged and with not enough urgency.
","It has great presentation values and it succeeds as a moving tribute to the men who fought in the Great War, but as a movie, it doesn't really excel. There are many things I liked about it, such as the tension at the start, the depiction of life in the trenches, the artistic way the horrors of war are presented, the fact you're never quite sure what's going on in the bigger picture and it really does emphasize the pointlessness of the whole concept of war. However, the actual events that occur along the way feel too staged and don't flow into each other very well, and everything just kind of happens with little fuss. The acting and the music is good and the focus on the human side is more grounded because of the destruction, but I never felt the urgency, which is after all, the main plotline.",6,3,8,10 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," It's a good film, but as it's very predictable and formulaic, I never really found it exciting or awe-inspiring.
","Sure the locations and the cute little characters have changed but the tempo of the plot and the concepts are all so similar to what has gone before. The music, presentation and special effects are great, but the lightsabre battle was lacking and some of the acting and dialogue was weak. Too long too.",5,2,9,13 October 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Refreshingly wonderful
","It's refreshing to see a Superhero movie where you don't know the plot or the characters, and although this is still standard Superhero fare, it is light, jovial and imaginative, just like a comic should be. The setting is full of wonder, larger than life characters and consequences on an epic scale. The film has some funny moments, lots of spectacular, colourful special effects and riveting action scenes. Entertaining throughout, but due to the quick pacing and so much going on, a lot of the aspects are touched on without much depth.",9,0,1,12 October 2018
Ip Man," Top quality martial arts and a powerful story to boot.
","A powerful story about loss, loyalty and top quality martial arts. The first act is funny but very jarring when it moves into the main part of the film which is more morose and serious. The acting quality varies, but the fight scenes are great, although some of the sound effects when they do some of the moves feel unnecessary. For a biography it skips over a lot of his life, but I guess that will be covered in the other films.",8,0,0,20 March 2020
Logan," A darker superhero story that pays off.
","A darker and more personal take on the X-Men universe, with a strong setting and dystopian atmosphere showing how times have changed. The action scenes are fast paced, bloody and brutal, but the story isn't that great and the supporting cast vary in quality. A moving and fitting ending with great leads who show real human emotion and struggle in strife.",8,3,5,12 October 2018
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Great action scenes and spectacular special effects with a strong cast of characters
","Great action scenes and spectacular special effects with a strong cast of characters and actors who manage to show both the superhero and human sides to their characters. The plot is typically extravagant, but fits in nicely to the greater plot arc, and the comedic one liners are used well. Although different enough, it does become quite samey, especially when compared to the Avengers' previous outing.",8,2,2,12 October 2018
Hotel Transylvania," Silly and goofy with a zany cast of characters and fast paced comic carnage.
","Dracula's a bit too over the top and some of the jokes don't work, but the basic story has a good moral message and the film is never boring. There's a wide selection of monsters, but not much is done with their mythology and I didn't like the ending at all or the techno/pop music finale.",6,0,0,4 April 2020
The Dark Knight," Well worth seeing multiple times.
","This film goes from good to great to excellent! It truly meets the hype, with a shocking storyline, a fantastic, crazy Joker, and more than enough great stunts and special effects. A much darker film than 'Begins', it is very violent with disturbing images, and at over 2 1/2 hours long, is not really suitable for children under 12. Also, some of the gadgets are illogical, Batman's voice seemed daft, and I am unsure about the ending.",10,0,1,13 October 2018
Midsommar," Artistic, memorable & shocking, but too similar to other films of the genre.
","A memorable and sometimes shocking experience which is very artistic in style and presentation with lots of colour and powerful sounds. The story means it has more than a few similarities to other films of the genre, but has a fresh approach to them thanks to the Swedish setting and folklore. It's not as horrific as it could have been, having a constantly unsettling feeling throughout instead, but the emotional acting and subject matter more than make up for it.",8,3,6,7 July 2019
Taken," A man on a mission
","Taken is a very brutal film with a lot of action and combat sequences. Initially, I thought the action was a bad move, but apart from towards the end when it gets a bit silly, is almost Bourne-esque and Bondian in style and quality. Simple acting and a simple story carried out in a gritty way by Neeson continue the excellence, and apart from the very happy ending, is a great film all round.",9,1,1,13 October 2018
Sicario," Slow burning, but very intense with shocking scenes, brutal violence and profound realisations.
","Great acting with an authentic, realistic style and setting which slowly reveals the story to you and lets you draw your own conclusions on whether the actions performed on both sides of the conflict are justifiable.",9,0,0,12 October 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not as good as Vol 1, but still good and full of adventure and fun.
","Not as good as the first one as it lacks the freshness and originality, but still a good film full of adventure and fun. Although the special effects and character effects are superb throughout, the film relies too heavily on them, leaving an underwhelming story and the emotional turmoil of the characters at odds with the more light-hearted setting. Comical in parts, but not that funny and not as memorable or exciting as it could have been.",7,0,1,12 October 2018
Zombieland," A student's view of a zombie apocalypse
","A student's view of a zombie apocalypse - funny, quirky, and ultimately about sex. There are some great funny moments and characters that grow on you, and enough fighting to keep it interesting, but the zombie survival techniques, emotional scenes and too much tongue in cheek spoil the atmosphere a bit, as does the lack of story. Great finale.",7,1,2,18 October 2019
Joker," An enthralling tragic comedy.
","An impressive origin story of the Joker which will really make you empathise with the character. Superb acting, great music and a strong, balanced plot which successfully builds up the tension for the predictably shocking grand finale. The story is tragic, darkly comical, and stylishly put together, although they could have done more to make the city feel like Gotham.",9,1,3,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Not a horror film, but a good film nonetheless.
","Thematically it's still a horror film, with fear-inducing topics, gore, shadowy beings, distorted realities and distressing scenarios straight out of twisted nightmares but practically, it's an action adventure film with an overreliance on CGI monsters to provide the scares. It's still a good film with a good story and a good cast of characters who show development and the monsters do look truly grotesque, both in appearance and the way they move, but it's never scary. The finale also drags on a bit too long but otherwise, it's a solid film.",7,0,0,28 September 2019
12 Strong," Overall, the film is too 'Hollywood' in its presentation to have any impact or credibility, even though it is based on true events.
","A typical American war film with typical American heroics, characters, military tactics, heavy handed morals, winning against overwhelming odds and over the top explosions and combat scenes. The action scenes are well put together and the setting is used well, but the story is too fragmented and the relationship between the American Captain and the Afghan warlord could have been developed more.",4,0,1,28 September 2018
The Secret Life of Pets," An amusing and entertaining diversion with great animation and snappy pacing.
","Although it doesn't quite have the same magic as some other animated films, it's still fun to watch and has a likeable and varied cast of characters.",7,0,0,24 May 2019
Arrival," A more intelligent and realistic sci-fi thriller
","A more intelligent and realistic sci-fi thriller, but the slow, drawn out pace and anticlimactic ending makes it difficult to recommend outright. Powerful and emotional at times thanks to the strong acting and orchestral pieces. The story/mystery keeps your interest, but some drama or suspense would have made it more interesting to watch.",7,0,4,13 October 2018
Parasite," Great and different
","A great film that really has a bit of everything in it. It starts off funny as they infiltrate the household before turning into a thoughtful look at the gap between the richest and poorest in society, and ultimately ends up as a bloodbath and rather sad. The social commentary is topical, the plot has some good surprises along the way, and the arty style and use of music makes it a very interesting film to watch.",8,12,17,25 January 2020
Wonder Woman," It's got everything you want and would expect in a superhero movie, but it's just not very good.
","Gadot is a great Wonder Woman who looks the part and plays the role very well, and the iconic set pieces combined with the music are marvellous. The special effects and slow motion action scenes look impressive and the scenes on the Greek island at the start of the movie are stunning. However, the majority of the plot is weak, the villains are terrible, and the final fight was boring to watch. The acting and supporting cast were ok, but felt unnecessary as they didn't really do much. Overall, I found it a slog to get through.",5,1,5,13 October 2018
Despicable Me," Great
","A classic cartoon comedy with the right amount of silliness, comedy, story and character development. Although the minions steal the show with their cuteness and wacky activities, the other supporting characters are well used. Looks great, and sounds great too.",9,0,0,13 October 2018
Taken 2," Completely unremarkable with a few daft moments and a lack of thrills.
","A completely unremarkable action thriller with a predictable plot, mediocre acting, and standard special effects. Nothing stands out, apart from a few daft moments and a lack of thrills.",3,1,1,13 October 2018
The Wolverine," aka The Wolverine's Adventures in Japan
","Good coverage of Japanese traditions and the action scenes are well put together, but the story is predictable and dull in parts. The more serious tone works well, and the new characters and villains fill their roles whilst allowing Logan to develop more as a character.",7,0,0,13 October 2018
The Dark Knight Rises," Not very dark or Gothic, but a spectacular ending to the franchise.
","Not very dark or Gothic and goes on for far too long, but a spectacular ending to the franchise with great special effects and combat scenes. The balance of emotional and atmospheric scenes build suspense to the climax, but as the story loses focus, it loses pace. Tons of character cameos keep it interesting to the end, but it had too much Blake and not enough focus on the villains.",8,0,1,13 October 2018
Black Panther," Not your standard Marvel movie.
","A less typical Marvel superhero movie which has great special effects, a superb African culture and setting, and a more human story. The story is good, with some surprises and a balanced mix of action, character development, and humour, but it does drag on at times and has a few holes. The wide range of characters each have their own appeal and show a much more human side to the proceedings, but none really stood out and the villains were disappointing in their simplistic desires. The special effects and fight scenes are great, being fast paced, energetic and not overly destructive, but as with most Marvel movies, the hero is too indestructible and as a consequence, any threat to him never seems real.",8,0,3,28 September 2018
Iron Man," Very good, but not that memorable.
","I guess we really like watching 'Clash of the Titans' movies, what with Transformers, this and the Incredible Hulk all in recent memory. Overall, a very good film with great special effects, but isn't that memorable by the end. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which improves the outlandish characters and comic book plot.",8,0,0,12 October 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good, dark and gritty.
","Dark and gritty and a masterpiece of artistic imagery which constantly refers back to the theme of light vs darkness. Although there is always something going on which keeps you entertained, it runs for too long building up to the fight scenes and tries to fit too much in, especially when it wastes time telling the Batman origin story yet again. Good casting of characters and the special effects are bombastic in scale, but neither the plot nor action scenes flow smoothly and the overall setting strays too far from its 'comic book' source.",7,1,2,13 October 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Definitely worth a watch with a great performance from the lead actor.
","Although the subject matter won't be to everyone's taste, this coming of age drama with humourous moments gives a realistic and bleak depiction of both the fanaticism and anti-hate ideas in Germany during the end of World War II. It's very smart about what it achieves, but I would have liked to see more humour and outlandishness as it is a bit slow in parts. Great acting from Jojo as the lead and strong performances from the rest of the cast, and good use of music too.",7,1,2,3 January 2020
Thor: The Dark World," Another entertaining superhero film
","Another entertaining superhero film with a good balance of light humour and action, never taking itself too seriously. The simple formulaic plot and some of the special effects could have been better. Good cast and acting within their limited extent; shame that superhero fatigue is beginning to set in...",7,2,3,12 October 2018
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Like seeing an old friend, Star Wars is back on the big screen where it belongs.
","Although this film has a LOT of throwbacks to the original trilogy in its settings, scenes and characters, they all work well together and make a solid story, complimented by the great acting from lesser known stars. Great action scenes and special effects, and the story sets up enough promise to be interesting in the next film.",9,1,30,13 October 2018
What We Do in the Shadows," A quirky, funny and fresh take on vampires.
","Very quirky and funny with an oddball cast of characters and interesting taste in music. It works quite well as a spoof documentary, and the simple yet effective special effects compliment the style. None of the ideas are truly original and it does run low on ideas towards the end, but it's still a fun and fresh take on vampires.",8,0,0,18 June 2019
Deadpool," Different, humorous and wickedly adult.
","A different kind of superhero movie, with a very irreverent lead character who is excellently portrayed by Reynolds. Although the plot is formulaic, the film is different enough in style to stand out and has plenty of well put together action scenes which are entertaining to watch. Humorous throughout with lots of in-jokes, mature jokes, immature jokes and references to the Marvel franchise, but it's not always as funny as it thinks it is.",8,0,0,12 October 2018
John Wick: Chapter 2," Enjoyable and daft, but fun with stylish and smart action scenes.
","There's a daftness about the whole premise (especially when played completely straight), but this doesn't stop you from enjoying this action packed revenge thriller. A very clichÃ© plot and characters, but the action scenes are very well put together, and the settings used are very stylish and smart. Entertaining and exciting, but also a bit too daft at times.",7,0,1,17 May 2019
Minions," Bright and colourful, but not that funny.
","Bright and colourful with a few funny moments, but hardly any jokes that will make you laugh out loud. The main trio (and their tribe) are comical and fun to watch, but the story is nothing special and the other characters are boring or underdeveloped. Lots of British culture and 60's references, but there should have been more gags in the other time periods.",6,0,0,14 October 2018
Incredibles 2," Fantastic fun and entertaining throughout
","Fantastic fun and entertaining throughout with fast paced action scenes, plenty of jokes, and superbly stylish animation. The story is good, although it could have been better, but it manages to deal with its modern issues well and in a relevant way. Great range of characters and plenty of memorable moments, overall a very enjoyable film.",9,1,2,28 September 2018
Mad Max: Fury Road," A superb action film which has fantastic special effects and action scenes throughout.
","The vision of this post-apocalyptic setting is very detailed and feels authentic, with a range of disfigured characters, beautiful maidens, and a world that looks and feels as though it has died. The music is great and well used, adding a bit of tongue-in-cheek to the proceedings. Although there isn't much to the plot and the dialogue is minimal, this adds to the strong atmosphere; everything is just a little bit mad. It also does become a bit repetitive, and it lacks some of the impact of the original Mad Max film, but still a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film.",9,0,1,13 October 2018
The Martian," A superb film showcasing both the beauty of the universe and the ingenuity and survivability of mankind.
","Entertaining throughout due to the interesting subject matter, the light hearted approach, and great acting from the cast, especially Damon. Gets a bit too unbelievable towards the end, but still gripping to watch, with fantastic special effects.",10,0,1,13 October 2018
