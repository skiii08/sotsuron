The Blair Witch Project," Well done.
","I enjoy movies. I really enjoyed this one. As for the people who thought it was the worst movie they have ever seen, I get the impression they add a new 'worst' or 'best' to their list on a weekly basis. Lose the hyperbole. As for the people who complain about the swearing...I guess Richard Pryor and Lenny Bruce were terrible comedians in their view. I had heard the ending didn't make sense or live up to expectations. I found the opposite to be true. The ending makes sense if you paid attention to the myths mentioned in the beginning of the film, and the suddeness and finality of it were fantastic. To the people who claim they could go out and shoot a better movie with their video camera in two days, just shut up. If you could, you wouldn't be talking about it, you would have done it already. The other irritating comment I hear is 'well, I knew it was fake.' So what. Sure it would have been even more effective if the viewer thought it was a real documentary. That being said, almost every other feature film made is fiction. Would you watch silence of the lambs and comment 'I knew it was Anthony Hopkins, the actor...there is no real Hannibal Lector.'  At the end of the day, two student directors came up with a good idea, filmed it with no budget, and ended up with a fresh, interesting film. Hats off.",Null,0,1,23 October 1999
