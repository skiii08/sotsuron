Raiders of the Lost Ark," Really don't see what all the hype is about
","Been meaning to see this film for about twenty years and finally made time for it. What a disappointment. Its just wilfully stupid all the way through, the 'plot' was thought out in the length of the average bowel movement and makes absolutely no sense. Nazis are digging for an artefact, Indiana has to stop them finding it. In reality they were looking in the wrong place and he actually found it for them. But then he manages to steal it back. Then they manage to steal it back and it kills them all anyway, and somehow he is the celebated hero who somehow accomplished something? Take him out of the equation and either the Nazis would have never found the artefact or they would have found it and all died exactly as happened. Wtf who thinks that is a plot?! Every scene was absurd and not thought through. Ridiculous coincidences outside of the usual allowed formulaic action move tropes, like 1000s of people at the dig site and no one keeping watch at night, not one person is awake? Was that a submarine or wasn't it? If it was why didn't it go underwater while he was riding on the top on a long journey? And why was no one up there with him? And the ark melts everyone who looks at it but because he kept his eyes closed he was safe, but the rope binding them conveniently burnt off anyway? Also, this one is inconsequential but annoying, she beat the guy at the drinking game because he passed out on his last drink, but he was just a turn ahead and she never finished that round either so why did she win? The movie was just mind numbing and tedious and seemed to treat the viewer as having half a brain cell. Worse than the worst of Hollywood dreck, why does it have such a following?",3,5,10,24 February 2020
