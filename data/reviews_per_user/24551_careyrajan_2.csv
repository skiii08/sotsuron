Rockstar," Ranbir Kapoor and A.R Rahman Steal the show
","First of all i went to watch the movie with lots of negative reviews coming from social networks. After I watched the movie i was shocked how this movie failed to impress that bunch of audience.Literally Ranbir kapoor outdid himself, he has acted superbly in the movie. Be it the struggling wanna be singer , who doesn't know the difference between a real broken heart and a fake love , or be it the singer star JORDAN who doesn't care a bit about the media , or never hesitate to point a middle finger to you.Movie starts and ends in same place, there are lots of flashback and abrupt pace changes in the movie, Imtiaz Ali lost marks due to some mismanagement of screenplay in second half. The movie ends with an open ending..and is up to the audience to decide what do they want to conclude.Rahman has done a fantastic job, the way he has maintained the rhythm throughout the movie is excellent, his music plays a key role in 'Sadda Haq' sequence which surely gonna blow you away..and yes its during this song, you will get the real meaning of the 'eco friendly' line...Nargis Fakri was a letdown, he got one of the best roles to start her career, she acted badly. Overall rockstar will leave you with a heavy heart, and a hangover of Ranbir's Performance.",8,0,0,17 November 2011
