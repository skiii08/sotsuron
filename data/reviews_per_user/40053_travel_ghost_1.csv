Marie Antoinette," Not quite...
","I can't seem to shake off the notion that the rock/modern music incorporated in a period film was a total rip-off from the likes of 'A Knight's Tale.' As with Sophia Coppola's style of film-making, this film is riddled with inconsistencies, and useless shots which, if not included in the final cut, may have saved the audience from the agony of sitting through two hours of general monotony. Not even the likes of Steve Coogan can bring this this film up. Honestly, I've never seen this director come out with anything substantial. (Lost in Translation? Please... that too was a fluke.) Yes, she has good command of the terms and processes of making a film, but somehow doesn't hold her own in terms of the actual execution. But then again, everyone is a critic. But this criticism comes from someone who can always see some form of saving grace in any film, n matter how horrible. What saves this film then? The production design, and that's why it scored a 4 in my book. One final note, daddy won't be proud...",4,0,0,19 March 2007
