The Blair Witch Project," The scariest/Creepiest movie I have seen in a long time!
","Holy christ, this has to be the creepiest movie you will see for a long time!! After about the first 30min your heart will be pumping and you will be out of breath. It grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go til the very end. Great acting and awesome filming. Definitely worth seeing!",9,1,2,24 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Sluggish at first, but well worth the wait.
","I just got back from a showing of this movie and I have to say it had an excellent ending. It started off okay but then seemed to slow to a crawl. It seemed to sort of hit a bump and they were just randomly tossing scenes at you to past the time, but after seeing the ending I'd had to say it is well worth the wait. The thrills were done well too. It wasn't constant or over bearing, just at the right moments. I certainly wouldn't call this a roller coaster thrill ride, but you will feel greatly rewarded at the end.",Null,0,0,31 July 1999
