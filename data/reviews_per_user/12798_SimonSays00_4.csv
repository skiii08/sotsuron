The Ring," Not Scary....
","I can't really take scary movies. They don't even have to be scary.. I've never been one for 'haunting' movies either. After I saw 'The Sixth Sense,' I had trouble sleeping for over a month (utterly pathetic, I know). I thought it was really ironic, then, that everyone found 'The Ring' to be soooo frightening. Maybe it is just because I had expected it to be sooo scary that I worked myself up for something extraordinarily 'scary', but when I saw it.. I was left thinking, 'well that was kinda stupid...' I mean the movie was entertaining, and sure, it was suspenseful.. but come on .... a girl walking out of a TV? Really now... 'The Ring' is a good movie and it's pretty clever, but for me it didn't really do it. Didn't have the effect on me that it seemed to on everyone else... kinda like 'The Blair Witch Project' .. that wasn't as scary as it was out to be either....",7,1,2,4 March 2004
Monster," Loved It!!
","I thought this was a phenomenal, very moving, very powerful movie! Definitely not for the easily disturbed. Perhaps also uneasy to watch for those (especially women) who are overly sensitive to material dealing with sexual abuse. I was very impressed with Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. I had never seen such extraordinary work from Theron, and frankly, had no idea she was capable of it. Although certainly fabricated from the true relationship, I totally bought into Theron and Ricci's relationship and really felt for the characters. After seeing this movie I went into depth researching the real Aileen Wuornos. Though I am not convinced with the accuracy of the movie (though it's important to note that I'd question the accuracy of any movie based on a real life event), I am convinced that this is one of the better films I've seen in quite some time! However, I can totally see where many may disagree with me on this. Because the movie touches such sensitive themes, I feel the movie is really a hit-or-miss. You'll either love it or hate it or be indifferent to it, but I doubt there will be many who just simply 'liked' or 'disliked' it. My personal consensus: 'GREAT MOVIE!'",9,0,1,29 February 2004
Mulholland Drive," CRAZY!
","This movie is great! It can be interpreted in so many different ways, and you can't see it too many times! It's really interesting to see how everyone interprets the movie differently. I'm curious as to what the movie is supposed to be about!!! It's worth watching!",9,1,1,18 November 2001
