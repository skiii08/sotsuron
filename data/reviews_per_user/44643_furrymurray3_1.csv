Scarface," top 5 movies ever
","In my opinion, and in many of my peers, this is one of the best movies ever made. It is better than 'the Godfather' for a few simple reasons: first of all, in one single movie, you see the start of a character, the raise to power and the downfall. Secondly, you get to see the transformation of more than one character and in several relationships, just as between Tony and Sosa, and Manny and Gina.However, like every movie it has some flaws. For example, it never tells you why Tony is so protective over his sister, or why his mom has so many problems with him. It also does not tell the true past of Tony Montana, only with a few glimpses here and there.This movie is also the most quotable ever made. From everything from 'say hello to my little friend' to 'move you white piece of bread,' you enjoy it from start to finish.9/10. Hands down, one of the greatest movies ever.",9,0,1,15 January 2006
