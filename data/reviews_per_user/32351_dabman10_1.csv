The Longest Yard," Another 'You can do it!' movie
","Thanks to Bigalow's bomb, let's hope that's the last time we'll hear it.Adam Sandler, playing as himself, gets drunk and gets into an unbelievable car chase. Though he appears to be a skinny white man, we assume he is a football player for the sake of the story. He arrives in a Texas prison and the following precedes: 1) In an unusual plot twist, Chris Rock, playing as himself, makes fun of black and white people. 2) Some old guy shows up and decides he's not important in the movie, so he never develops his character and remains on the sidelines. 3) Sandler helps a black guy advertise Mcdonald's to other black people. White posers want to be black so they dig the mcmarketing as well. 4) Chris Rock gets what's coming and becomes the black guy who dies first. The evildoer got him by putting napalm in a radio or something. Sorry for the spoiler. 5) Sandler scores the winning touchdown, ensuring that the movie is finally over and we can all use the toilet.To football fans: Females rated this movie one point higher on IMDb than males did. This should tell you how good of a football movie it was.",1,4,9,24 September 2005
