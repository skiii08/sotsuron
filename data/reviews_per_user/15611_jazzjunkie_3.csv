50 First Dates," great movie about love
",This is a really good movie to bond with your G F or your Wife  or other . I think it is a serious 'chick flick' if you want to call it that.  It is about a guy so determined to win the girl of his dreams that he has to first win her over every day.  then he has made this VHS tape to show her what her life is like and remind that they are in love but she breaks it off and things go down hill from there but the good guy wins as always.  Of course. I dont pay attention to plot development or directing style or plot lines and how the writer messed up or the director did not do something that only some one in directing school or in show business would worry about.  I just watch the movie and either enjoy or complain about it. I think it is worth the money spent and time invested in watching it.,8,0,0,2 September 2004
American Pie," Strange Movie
","This was a VHS rental,  it was a strange movie but a good way some of the scenes were weird like to sock on his ????  and trying to hump the pie  to see what IT would feel like.  If I recall right they all seemed to end up with decent dates.  I will have to watch '2' just to see the next one before I watch Am Wedding.  but most likely wont see it again.",6,0,0,4 August 2003
Mulholland Drive," Nice street Strange Movie
",I thought I was going bonkers    why couldn't I figure out this movie?? Then I read a couple of newsgroup reviews and figured it out ...It was the movie not me...   It had a plot that was hard to follow you had a very hard time trying to figure out what was a real scene and what was fantasy or what someone was dreaming...It went along fairly well from the beginning since I had no clue of what to come ...Then it started with the twists and turns in the storyline and got confusing as to who was what ...first she was Betty then she was Diane but Diane was dead or someone was dead in that apt..and then mystery woman was Rita then she was camila but camila was shown as blonde and ann miller was the apt mgr not the directors Mother... Oh well like one reviewer said just go with ....  so I've seen it but probably won't ever get it again   one time was confusing enough...,4,2,6,29 August 2004
