Hereditary," OK - But not as good as I was expecting.....
","Good-ish film. Did watch until the end, but I feel it fell a bit short based on all the hype about it.
Wished I'd waited until it was free to watch, rather than paying for it.
Was okay but doesn't make it onto my 'would watch again' list.....",5,0,0,6 January 2019
The Shape of Water," I was rather disappointed.
","Was okay, but I was rather disappointed with this one.
I usually really enjoy Guillermo del Toro films but this one did not hit the mark in my eyes.
A lot of hype for not very much really. I paid for the film as the expectation was, that it was going to be really good.
Wished I had waited for it to be included in my viewing package.",5,2,5,6 January 2019
