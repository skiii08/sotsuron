E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," amazing
",This movie changed the business of film making forever.  I find it amazing that it is ranked so low by imdb's users.  I believe that on its historic impact on the business alone it should be in the top twenty.  The only reason I can see it being this low is because Speilberg has kept such a tight reign on the availability of it.  It is the least exploited film of all time.  Most blockbusters are totally over exposed and he didn't let that happen to E.T. thus if your younger than 21 there is a good possibility that you never saw it.,10,1,2,28 June 2002
Jaws," The best movie ever made
","There was never a movie before, and there has never been a movie since that impacted the psyche of people around the world the way that Jaws did. Till this date you can't help but be a bit apprehensive about entering the crests of an ocean break.  You start hearing the deep grumble of the two note score of Jaws approaching.  It is a shame that it has been cheapened by being overplayed on TNT.Jaws is Speilberg's best film by far.  He had to push his creative genius to its edge because unlike his films now, he didn't have a bottomless pile of cash to dip into.  He made you love his characters. It's also beautifully shot.  The shot of Brody sitting on the beach as the Kittner boy is eaten with the camera dollying in and the lens being widened out is used all the time now thanks to this move.Brody, Hooper, and Quint also give us one of the most interesting mismatches of characters ever to grace the screen.  The scene at night in the boat after they've attached the first barrel is the kind of scene that all film makers should be trying to duplicate.  The USS Indianapolis monologue is the kind of speech every actor dreams that a writer could plop in their mouth.
In order to truly see if what I say is true, that Jaws is the best film ever,  ask yourself this one question.  Does anybody look at the ocean the same way they did before 1975.",10,2,4,28 June 2002
