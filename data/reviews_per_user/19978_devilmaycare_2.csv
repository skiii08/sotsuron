Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," .......pretty awful
","if you love the 'star wars' universe, or you're into the special effects and laser light shows...then look no further and dive right in. those looking for good acting, dialog, a meaningful story........who the heck wrote this script anyway? i live in 'bizarro world' ,where tons and tons of people love this calculated crap. owes ALL its fame and fortune to the original trilogy (which is showing its age also). not the worst ever, just a stale trifle with bombastic puffery........lets see, ten lines, this is the frigging last time. when did IMDb get so.......cubicle?k , then,how about some more crap, IMDb? sheesh, when you're done you're done........",4,0,1,1 February 2007
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," average, 6.0
","unlike most of the media critics reviews i have read, i thought this was not as good as the first one, although i thought the first one was just decent. maybe the dvd version will be better, most people who have seen the first movie on dvd say it is more ' filled out.'POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:this movie was divided into three plotlines, only one of which i found half interesting. the ents and merry and pippen: very disappointing. gollum and frodo and samwise: filler. the riders of rohan and the rest of the fellowship: lots of potential and held my interest but never really fulfilled its promise, although some scenes were nice.the fellowship- 6.5 stars the two towers- 5.9 starshopefully the last one will bring it all off as i loved the books and hope for the best.",Null,0,0,5 January 2003
