Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the greatest family adventures of the 90's
","The phantom menace was one of the most innocent films of the star wars saga and most child-like as in this one we see kids for the first time in these films along with a character, Jar Jar that can sure give children across the world a new favorite character. But don't get me wrong, this was a great film for adults too.Some people seem to get extremely negative about this film as it is very different to the older ones and not as good. But if it isn't as good as the older ones doesn't make it bad but a lot of people over hype it just like they did when the old films were done up. Who cares if greedo shot first? This is how sensitive people get to these movies, if one thing is different, its bad but it REALLY isn't.To me this is very similar to the first film but has a very different story. It is great fun to watch this film and it is just non-stop the whole way through, this really is a great adventure film.",8,1,2,29 April 2007
Inception," The greatest film i have ever seen
","This is the film i have been waiting for to blow me away. No film in history has really hit me this hard before. From the director of some other favorite films of mine such as Memento, The Prestige and the new Batman films has made something beyond his previous works.Some great performances here such as Leonardo Dicaprio who plays the Extractor, a man who intercepts other people's dreams to access their minds. The storyline to this movie will have you in pieces by the end. It offers both intellectual and emotional entertainment unlike anything made before. The visuals and visual storytelling here is magnificent as well, being one of the few major films that overuse CGI. Is it a technology filmmakers can sit on their ass with or is it a real artistic tool?I hope from this film that it can influence more of the industry to give us more originality because ultimately, a horrible sequel or remake can make a lot of money but will you be paying for it in 50 years time over this?",10,2,5,24 July 2010
