Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Fantastically Addictive and great plot. Guilty Pleasure!
","Although some say that the plot and story line of this movie is very unrealistic and poorly thought about, i completely disagree. This movie has taken a well known piece of American history and added a fantasy twist. The directors have tried to give you the feel off an alternate world with alternate history, and any good fantasy film tends to do this. Yes there are a lot of CGI effects and action scenes, but it is the type of movie that benefited from that. I myself do not watch fantasy or period/history films, but this surprised me. Acting could be judged at times, but for an actor who has been in very few films their were times when Benjamin Walker showed real star quality. Definitely worth a watch and i will be purchasing this film on DVD as a guilty pleasure.",10,10,18,22 June 2012
