Walk the Line," Cash vs Ray, Booze vs Heroin, guts vs soul
","When I was a boy I visited a friend in Germany whose father had the unsettling name of Adolf. He spoke very little English and he used to sit in his great-chair and listen to Johnny Cash, hour after hour. The music never grabbed me, but it sure grabbed him, seven thousand miles away in another land. So when the film came out I was overjoyed. Finally a chance to solve the mystery of why Cash was so appealing. I felt like I was about to be initiated into a secret society. Nobody would go with me so I went alone. I wore black.I can't help but compare this musician biopic to last year's Ray. I loved Ray so very much as a film. His music was more my speed than country but the film too was a warm and loving portrayal of a man who absolutely adored his music. Ray was a musical genius, a kind soul, someone I would be friends with if I had the chance. I wasn't half way through Walk the Line when I knew, Cash was no Ray. He was angry, depressed, violent, disrespectful, and destructive. But he didn't have a fraction of the talent that Ray had to redeem himself with: Cash was not a musical genius. He just had balls. And both Cash and Ray were haunted by their childhood, and they were both addicts. But Cash was addicted to the far less exotic booze and pills rather than Ray's pot and opium. Ray was high but Cash was always low.Walk the Line was a hard film to watch although in the end I wanted the singer to find success or at least love. This was a mean guy that I shouldn't care about or invest in, but I did, so that much of the film worked. I don't think I'll listen to his music, but I understand better whey Adolf did.",7,1,3,10 December 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," A fantasy world that is not so dark and dismal
","I entered the theater a little worried. I began reading CS Lewis when I was 12 and I had already read the first book to my 6 year old daughter so the cat was out of the bag on Christian morality in our world of myths of legends (as well as a good dose of pagan nature worship). But I was unsettled by some of the reports on the news about how the Christian right had been targeted by Disney for this film and that it managed to get a PG rating (putting it somewhere in between 'Because of Win Dixie' and 'Racing Stripes'). So, I feared that my beloved books would be zealously Chistianized for the sake of the massive Evangelical movement in this country and its many many dollars. To my delight, I found the same wonderful level of Chistian sentiment in the film that are in the books. Nothing offensive (to me at least), no dogma, no lectures, no secret Jesus messages beyond the original ones that Lewis included. And as I breathed a sigh of relief that this wasn't another 'Vegi-Tales' the film washed over me like a bath of fantasy come to life. The mythical creatures were delightful and the world of Narnia was worth saving. And I loved Lucy (but I never felt much for Peter or Susan, not in the film, not in the books).After having watched The Lord of the Rings many times and even the Harry Potter films way more than I needed to I was beginning to grow weary of the fantasy world that was once wonderful, now a dark and forbidding place filled with evil. Peter Jackson's love affair with Orcs, demons and the Dark Lord is forgivable (because Tolkien was obsessed with it too, although Tolkien also created a Middle Earth that was so beautiful and ancient and amazing that you wanted to go there, to live there, but who would really want to live in Jackson's Middle Earth, full of ghosts and loneliness and decay). But Narnia managed to have the villainy without creating a hopeless world of darkness. Again, it felt like the books. And I didn't miss the blood and the slime that Narnia could have had. For me it was a real success.Now, let's hope that they are quickly shooting the next few books so that they can catch these kids before they get too old.",9,4,5,12 December 2005
War of the Worlds," cruel and angry
","Tom Cruise usually lights up the screen for me (Last Samurai, The Firm, Far and Away) and his choice of characters is usually sympathetic. But his character in Spielberg's War of the Worlds was simply unappealing and even repugnant at times. It's too bad because the Spielberg/Cruise machine has the money and the man power to do just about anything they want to on screen. Even thought this made a heck of a lot of money it was far less successful than the original black and white version of the book, or even the 2005 version by David Latt, 'HG Wells War of the Worlds'. The main character in that had more heart and held more sympathy than Cruise even came close to in the Spielberg epic.",4,1,1,14 December 2005
