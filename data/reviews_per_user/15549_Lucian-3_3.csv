The Blair Witch Project," A great film that makes a sad comment on modern film-goers
","As excellent as The Blair Witch Project is I am saddened by those who fail to appreciate it.  The era of postmodern film has gone on so long that audience members have lost the ability to empathize with characters on screen.  Movie makers have made their self-referential little jokes and reminded movie goers 'it's just a movie' for so long now that people forget how to look at a movie as if it were real event.  BWP's attempt to create a hyper-realistic movie experience is sabotaged by those who choose to deride the film (out loud, in the theatre) simply because they have been so conditioned by CGI, soundtracks and big name stars they're no longer capable, or perhaps are afraid, to have a genuine emotional experience at a film.",9,0,0,4 August 1999
The 13th Warrior," Ah Beowulf
","Nice to see classic literature as the basis for a new movie.This was no artistic masterpiece but it was a good portrayal of the Norse culture, no big horned hats, no brutes wandering about looking like refugees from those Wunderbar ads they made in the 70's and have, inexplicably, put back on the air now.I really liked the cast. Banderas did a fine job. Not entirely believeable but not a fantasy movie.  And the scene of him learning their language was an excellent piece of film-making.",7,0,0,26 October 1999
Cast Away," A film that falls somewhat short of its lofty goals
","My trip to my small hometown of Peterborough, Ontario included a visit to their new Galaxy Theatre. I must say I am impressed. In a city of 65,000 to see a theatre that would be at home in a major centre was quite a surprise.
On the schedule for the night was Cast Away. One of the saddest lessons I learned was that importing a high class theatre does not guarentee a high class audience. My enjoyment of the film was harmed immensely by chatty idiots all around me. To quote Max Eilerson (from the criminally short-lived Babylon 5: Crusade series) 'I hate it when I go the movies with kids in the audience, because there's always someone there that tells me I can't kill them when they get loud. Now who makes up these rules anyway?'
With that out of my system I'll move on to describe the film. First will come my spoiler free review and some spoiler notes will be at the bottom. You have been warned. Cast Away dares a great deal. Only the attachment of big names like Hanks and Zemeckis could have gotten this movie made. And, to be certain, Hanks is amazing and should be considered the Oscar frontrunner as of now. His performance is very believable and the lengths he went to for the role should be given credit by many in the Academy. Cast Away is based on a book and, before seeing the film, I read a review speculating the film would shy away from many of the darker aspects of the storyline. It doesn't. However, there is so much story to cover here that much of it has to be told in shorthand. This is not a film that spoon feeds its audience everything they need to know. You are expected to be able to fill in a lot of gaps yourself. It's refreshing to be treated as a thinking, perceiving being for a change (though judging from the comments of idiots around me they weren't up to the task; I guess I won't recommend the film to idiots which should only serve to enhance the moviegoing experience of others) but the gaps in narrative can be jarring at times.
Still if the greatest fault of the film is that its reach exceeds its grasp that is only because it has reached very far. And a film that dares and falls short is far more satisfying to watch than a formulaic film that touches all the bases in a routine home run. I give Cast Away an 8 out of 10.",8,0,0,30 December 2000
