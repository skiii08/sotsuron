Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Big Hype = Big Let Down
","Yeah, I've seen it.  The biggest movie of the summer, billed as possibly the biggest movie of all time.  If this movie dethrones Titanic it will be a crying shame.  There are just too many special effects, so much to where it is more of a cartoon than a movie.  The characters were not interesting. The Darth Maul character was almost pointless.  He barely said two words. He doesn't even hold a candle to Vader. This movie will make George Lucas an even bigger fortune, not because of what it is, but because of what the original series was.",7,0,1,14 June 1999
