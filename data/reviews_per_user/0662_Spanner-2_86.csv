First Man," Impressive historical film
","A very effective film, recreating the events leading up to the first moon landing. Using some refreshingly old school vfx techniques and some creative production design the film really puts you in the cockpit of the capsule and onto the lunar surface with Ryan Gosling. Gosling is terrific in this role, as Neil Armstrong as well.",9,24,58,8 October 2018
The Legend of Bagger Vance," Solid and entertaining
","This golf fantasy was directed by Robert Redford,with his typical eye for detail and works for the most part, though if you dislike golf it may not be to your tastes. Matt Damon is a young man who was once the greatest golfer in all of Savannah, but after a stint in World War Ihe vanished into the wilds of depression, leaving his wife (a mesmerizing asalways Charlize Theron) behind. Several years later, Theron is throwing a golf tournament to try to save her late father's golf resort, and she invites tworeal life golfing legends to participate. Of course the towns people of Savannah want a local boy in the match and soon enough they hunt down Damon and talk him into participating. Of course he must recapture his long lost love of the game,in which he is aided by mysterious golfing guru Will Smith (a more subdued and effective role than usual for him). The time and place are captured quite nicely and I appreciated the fact that the other golfers weren't turned intovillains as a lesser film might have done; this film is basically Damon trying to win out over his own personal demons rather than having an external foe.Solid performances abound in a very effective film that's only flaw is its propensity to perhaps take itself a tad too seriously.

Miracle," Entertaining sports movie
",Rousing sports film about the 1980 U.S. Hockey team features some nicely shot game footage and a solid performance from Kurt Russell as the driven coach. Suffers from some formula moments and a clunky subplot with Russell's wife (Patricia Clarkson) but otherwise a fine piece of entertainment. GRADE: B,8,4,6,11 February 2004
Ali," Will Smith is great, film has flaws
","A fairly good film with actor Will Smith gamely taking on the role of  the most charismatic boxer in history. Smith is quite good in the role, practicaly disappearing into the part. The film itself is sort of a 'greatest hits' package that faithfully recreates important moments in the history of Ali but never quite gets below the surface to let you know what makes this guy tick, a flaw that keeps the film from being what it could have been. GRADE: B+",7,0,1,28 December 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Good film, but not as good as it could be
","This period film has Leonardo DiCaprio as a real life con man who pretends to be a airpline pilot, lawyer and doctor by watching tv shows and impersonating the characters. DiCaprio was born to play this part and pulls it off quite well, with the right mix of charm and youthful exuberance. Tom Hanks as the FBI Agent on his trail is somewhat less effective but aquits himself ok. This Steven Spielberg film works fairly well, but doesnt quite connect as it should as we never really get inside the head of the protagonist to know what makes him tick, sure his adventures are fun to watch but we dont care about him as much as we should. GRADE: B+",7,0,0,1 January 2003
The Ring," Disturbing but excellent
",An effective remake of a Japanese horror film. This film stars Naomi Watts as  a reporter who starts investigating a mysterious videotape that causes people to die one week after they watch it. The film keeps the suspense up throughout due to an excellent performance from Watts in the lead and some solid atmospheric sets and cinematography. You'll be on the edge of your seat throughout and then jolted once more with the shocking twist ending.. This one definitely gets reccomended. GRADE: A-,9,0,0,5 November 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Remains a sci-fi classic
","The reissue of this film holds up fairly well despite some amusing early 80s references that are good for a few laughs and somewhat date the film.  The added couple of minor scenes arent too distracting and the spruced up effects are good.. only quibble is that the removal of the handguns of the guards (and replacing them with walkie-talkies) looks kinda silly as cops are holding radios as if they were guns... Still, the film mostly still works though its a tad slow by todays standards. Still, remains an effective film with good performances and a nice moving storyline. GRADE: A-",7,0,0,25 March 2002
Minority Report," Excellent
","An impressive film, perhaps the most complete film Steven Spielberg has directed in quite some time. Tom Cruise (in an effective performance) stars as a pre-crime cop assigned to stopping crimes before they occur.. until he is fingered and must go on the run from his own policeforce. A fascinating and well thought out look at a possible future world realized thru impressive visual effects and solid production design.. the story keeps you involved and guessing, though the revelation of the eventual bad guy is not as much of a surprise as it could have been.. The acting is good all around, with solid supporting turns from a top notch crew of character actors.. I thought this one was quite good. GRADE: A",9,0,0,1 July 2002
Training Day," Washington is excellent, ending is awful
",Denzell Washington and Ethan Hawke are terrific in this cop drama about a rookie cop who finds out his mentor is crooked. The film is excellent for the first two thirds beforing veering way off course in a rather preposterous conclusion that almost wrecks  the good that comes before. Still worth watcing just for the terrific performance by Washington. GRADE: B,7,1,11,21 October 2001
A Star Is Born," Good acting and production
","This one benefits from some strong central acting performances, solid direction and some good original songs. While the overall storyline is very familiar and the story beats expected, the performers do a very good job of hitting the right notes and they have a good chemistry with each other that makes it work.",8,1,5,8 October 2018
Erin Brockovich," Surprisingly good
","Another film i managed to watch at long last. I was pleasantly surprised with this film, starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney. Both of them are excellent, as the white trash woman with an attitude and the small time lawyer who wind up winning a big lawsuit against a giant utility company. GRADE: A",9,1,1,30 January 2001
Meet the Parents," Mildly Amusing Comedy
","A mildly amusing comedy with Ben Stiller as a young man who is brought home to meet his girlfriends family before asking her to marry him. Robert DeNiro as her slightly paranoid father is a real hoot here and the film, though rather predictable, does have several funny moments. GRADE: B",8,0,0,29 October 2000
Unbreakable," Good but not Willis is weak
","UNBREAKABLE [Touchstone]: An interesting follow-up film from the writer-director of the 'Sixth Sense.' This one has Bruce Willis (in another zombie like performance) as a man who survives a train crash and is pursued by comic book collector Samuel L. Jackson, who tries to convince Willis that he is, in fact, a super hero. The storyline is actualy fascinating and it does have a nice twist at the end. Alass, Willis complete lack of emotional depth here hurts the film somewhat. GRADE: B",8,1,1,1 December 2000
Monster," Great performances, bleak film
","Intense film that starts Charlize Theron (who just won a Golden Globe for this role) as a prostitute turned serial killer... A somewhat bleak film, but Charlize is terrific. She completly disappears into her role.. sure it took a beat or two to accept the normally flawless actress looking so unappealing.. but you quickly get into the character and forget her appearance. Christina Ricci  plays her young lover... and does a good job also, but this is Charlize's movie. GRADE: A-",8,0,0,26 January 2004
The Rookie," Passable sports film
","This effort is based on the true story of Jim  Morris, a high school science teacher/baseball coach, who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his life-long dream of playing in the majors.  Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sports films, plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the real-world events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays. The first half of the film, dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players (all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School) is less effective and probably a bit too long. Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without. However, it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason. GRADE: B-",7,1,1,1 April 2002
Captain Marvel," Fun entertaining Marvel film
","I rather enjoyed the latest Marvel Cinematic Universe film. Brie Larson is a welcome addition to the roster and she does a good job with this character. The film has some standard origin movie motifs but the winning cast, which also includes Samuel L. Jackson's venerable Nick Fury and Jude Law, helps a lot. The film is set in the 90s and the vfx work to make Sam Jackson look younger are truly terrific. While the ending becomes a bit of a CGI mess like many of these films do, the character work and story keep the story involving. Looking forward to the continuation in the next Avengers film.",8,5,11,11 March 2019
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Entertaining but light
","An entertaining comedy/action film that keeps you entertained even if you barely remember it later.  Johnny Depp hams it up as the deposed pirate and Orlando Bloom gets to act heroic but the performances are mostly over the top mugging.. still the action is entertaining enough and it keeps your attention from wandering into the numerous plot holes.. As films based on DIsneyland attractions go, this one is an improvement over 'The Country Bears' and is somewhat entertaining, despite the various flaws. GRADE: B",6,0,1,22 July 2003
Billy Elliot," Dull
","While technically sound, I found this tale rather uninteresting.  The poor kid wants to be a ballerina.. good for him.. unfortunately I really didn't care much. The film itself is well made, but the storyline simply didn't interest me. GRADE: B-",3,3,15,30 January 2001
Finding Nemo," Entertaining film for the family
","The latest effort from Pixar Studios has its charming moments and the typical top flight animation one has come to  expect from these guys.. and I enjoyed this story of the fish searching for his missing son more than the overrated 'Monsters, Inc.' A fun film for the family, though this one doesnt break new ground or really stand out afterwards. GRADE: B+",8,0,0,17 June 2003
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Formula hokum
","A fair romantic comedy with Kate Hudson as a collumnist for some cheasy girls mag who has to find a guy and get him to dump her in 10 days by doing the obnoxious things that girls do (her words, not mine). Of course she chooses Matthew McConaughey who plays an obnoxious advertising guy who has just made a bet to find a girl and make her fall in love with him in 10 days. It's a battle of the wills in this silly piece of hookum. Hudson is cute and perky even when she's being crazy and McConaughey is such a cocky womanizer that you find yourself thinking that she could do so much better.. when they inevitably do get together at the end, in one of those cheesy and done a zillion times movie endings that I'm getting sick of.. Still, as pleasant enough time waster of  a romantic comedy its ok.. though the ending coulda been somewhat more creative. GRADE: C",5,1,2,10 February 2003
The Others," Excellent
","I finaly got a chance to catch this highly touted ghost story starring Nicole Kidman and it exceeded my expectations. The performances, especially Kidman's are top notch and the story keeps you guessing.. I thought i had it all figured out but they still through some last minute curves at me that I wasn't expecting.Top notch filmmaking with only a few minor plot holes to keep the grade down. GRADE: A-",9,0,0,4 February 2002
Troy," A mixed bag
","Big budget epic from Wolfgang Peterson ('The perfect Storm') that translates the Greek tale of the Trojan War into a Hollywood Action film. And the battles are in fact, terrific. Some great fight scenes make the film really kick at times... which is good cause when the fighting stops and the dialogue creeps in.. things go mediocre pretty fast. Brad Pitt plays Achilles, but he seems to be channeling Fabio in his performance.. all preening and posing.. with the most leaden line reads in the whole cast. Pitt seems very uninterested in his work, he has done much better stuff before, but here he is so leaden and dull that you want him to get killed off almost at once.. Eric Bana, who was dreadful in 'The Hulk' plays Hector, the Trojan hero.. and he probably comes off best in the film. Bana is the only actor in the film who gives a watchable performance.. He radiates the charisma that a leader of his stature should have, and when he is on screen the character scenes work.. Unfortunately, too much time is taken up with Pitt's weirdly homoerotic relationship with his cousin and assorted other dumb plots. Orlando Bloom does what he can with the character of Paris, kindof a playboy prince who starts the conflict by stealing the Queen of Sparta (a bland Diane Krueger) and then becomes a sniveling wimp till the end.. but its such an unglamorous part that you feel sorry for him.. Sean Bean shows up as Odysseus, but his character is given short shrift, odd for such an important figure in Greek Mythology. Again, the film is watchable and even enjoyable because of some great battles and Bana's work... but tune out quickly whenever Pitt starts talking to anyone... his dialogue is terrible and his performance so wooden you could splinter it... GRADE: C+",4,1,6,17 May 2004
Insomnia," good suspense film
","This film, from director Chirstopher Nolan ('Memento') follows burned out veteran L.A. cop Al Pacino as he travels to Alaska with his partner (Martin Donovan) to help a green local cop (an effectuve Hilary Swank) solve a murder case. More about Pacino's dealing with his inner demons than with investigating the crime, the identity of the killer is never really a secret.. the acting is excellent from all involved, especialy Pacino and Swank. Robin Williams, in a key role, also makes an impression but not quite as strong of one. Nolan's direction keeps things involving, though his pacing at times is lagging. Still, a worthwhile effort. GRADE: B+",8,0,0,28 May 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," Good fx, bad characters
","The end of the world is approaching in director Roland Emmerich's latest big budget disaster movie. In this film, scientist Dennis Quaid's predictions of global warming spurring a new ice age are ignored until it happens and half of the U.S. is destroyed.. Emmerich again displays his nack for big budget destruction, with some impressive visual effects sequences showing Los Angeles and New York City being destroyed.. Unfortunately for the film and the audience, the 'human element' which the story relies on doesn't work quite as well with indie film actor Jake Gyllenhall seemingly at a loss while trying vainly to play Quaid's son... trapped in the New York Library with his fetching would be girlfriend (Emmy Rossum, who gets to look pretty but not much else). Sela Ward shows up as Quaids wife, and gets to take care of a sick cancer patient in the most pointless and exploitive subplot in the film. Basicaly for an action movie, there isn't much action.. No one really does anything about the impending disaster, they mostly react when it occurs.. I got a bit bored between scenes of destruction... even having the president and vice-president be such comical parodies of our current administration didn't quite work for me, much as I enjoy a good anti-Bush joke as much as the next guy.. Anyways, as a cautionary tale.. OK.. the fx are good... too bad the story doesn't really work. GRADE: C-",6,0,0,7 June 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A complete mess of a movie.
","This film, the third in the trilogy, is definitely the weakest. Now I was not a huge fan of it's predecessors, but part 3 is just such a mess that I was often left completely bewildered by the storyline. Characters come and go with no explanation for who they are or what their connection to other characters are... the whole storyline with the woman that has to be released or whatever made no sense and had no big payoff at the end since she basicaly just disappears! The sudden decision by Orlando Bloom that he needs to get married during the big fight seemed to be just to create some comic moments because there was no chemistry at all between him and the girl in the film.. they really seemed to dislike each other for much of the film... Really I could not even figure out why the pirate group didn't kill Bloom since he kept double crossing them repeatedly during the film, his motivations remained unclear the entire time and the 'ending' didn't do anything to help with that.The only thing at all good about this film were the effects, which of course were excellent.. so if you want to sit through a 2 1/2 hour film for the chance to exclaim 'wow... cool effects' then go right ahead.. but after half an hour of that.. it just gets dull and repetitive...I'm giving it a 4 out of 10... for the effects and sound design mostly... everything else is terrible.",4,3,7,29 May 2007
We Were Soldiers," Excellent war movie
","This war movie features Mel Gibson in a true story about the early days of the Vietnam war. This film works primarily because the story is compelling and Gibson as the commander of this group of soldiers is excellent, you truly feel that he is a leader. Some truly horrific warfare of course takes up most of the film, but the film does also let you spend some time with the wives back home (Madeline Stowe and 'Felicity' vet Keri Russell are the only recognizable ones) so you can get some sense of what they go through as well.. the film also shows a few scenes of the Vietcong commanders and treats them as real people rather than the charactures that so often end up in American war movies.  Chris Klein, however,  is somewhat miscast as a young soldier, just as he was miscast as an action hero in 'Rollerball..' he really should stick to comedies like the 'American Pie' movies that made him famous. But aside from that one casting misfire, the film itself is excellent in it's portrayl of a battle most of us probably don't know anout. GRADE: A-",9,0,1,4 March 2002
BlacKkKlansman," Interesting and informative
",This film kept my attention due to an interesting subject matter and a good cast.. I'm not particularly a fan of Spike Lee's work but this one was rather good. I don't think it needed the ending tag that ties it to Trump and Charlottesville but I understand why it was done that way.,9,4,9,10 January 2019
Final Destination 2," Bad acting, silly ending hurt decent sequel
","The first 'Final Destination' film was entertaining and creative as a group of students tried to outwit death... now comes the sequel.. is it as good as the original? No.. not even close. Is it entertaining in it's own right? Yes, to a point. The lead character this time is played by A.J. Cook, a young actress who seems to be popping up in many of these thriller films these days. She plays Kimberly, a girl who has a vision that forshadows a freeway crash that kills herself and many others. She blocks traffic and saves a handfull of people, while others die in the gruesome tragedy. And this movie does not skimp on the violence or gore like many other films these days do. The death scenes in this one are quite gruesome. Of course death starts picking off the survivors in freak accidents and Kimberly goes off to find the only survivivng character from the first film (Ali Larter, looking like she's phoning this one in after cashing what was probably a decent size check for a fairly small part). The film is entertaining on its own face, but does have problems. The conections to the first film are tenuous and seem forced and rather silly and the acting (with the exception of Cook, who does a servicable job) is bad, even by these films standards. The story has enough twists and turns and false scares to provide a decent ride, though understanding all the hookum about death and how to trick him is rather mind boggling, the ending is as silly as can be.  Still, its entertaining enough and has some cool effects and gore scenes so that the less discriminating horror fans should enjoy it. GRADE: C",7,0,0,3 February 2003
Blade II," Campy Trash
","This is the second film with Wesley Snipes as the half vampire superhero dude who this time has to team up with some nasty vampires to fight some even nastier creatures that are killing them. The storyline is pretty silly and played exclusively for camp value.. some gruesome blood and gore ensues durring a film that seems to be living for creating cool carnage scenes. And that it does do fairly effectively, I just wish they had a bit more story or that Snipes didn't seem to be just hamming it up the whole movie. GRADE: C-",5,1,5,25 March 2002
Elf," Fun movie
","In this xmas themed comedy, Will Ferrell plays a man raised as an elf who travels to New York to find his biological father.  As silly as that sounds, this is actualy a pretty funny and amusing film that works because of Ferrell's conviction in the role and some funny bits of stunt casting including James Caan as the daddy, Bob Newhart as head elf and Ed Asner as Santa!  A funny film that the kids will love and you will actualy enjoy. GRADE: B+",9,0,1,10 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Entertaing space adventure
","The latest chapter of the 'Star Wars' saga is a definite improvement over episode 1.The action sequences are impressive, the story has more depth and the villains, particularly Christopher Lee as Dooku and Temuera Morrison as Jango Fett, are well played and acted, Ewan McGregor, somewhat stiff last time out, really delivers a solid and well realized performance as Obi-Wan. While a lot of the early reviews have panned the love story and the performances of Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen, I would tend  to disgree,, yea they arent as good as some of the elders, but they are ok and the romance (while perhaps taking up a bit oo much screen time) is properly handled as a kindof corny flirtation between two teenagers who are both somewhat full of themselves. While the film does have its flaws (some slow sections towards the middle, some shaky character animation) on the whole it work as part of the 'Star Wars' epic and is an entertaining rollercoaster ride on its own. And if you are paying attention to all the undertones if what is really happening beneath the surface, its almost a greek tragedy. I do definitely reccomend the movie. GRADE: B+",9,0,2,20 May 2002
The Bourne Identity," Good entertainment
","This thriller, based on the book by Robert Ludlam and the TV Movie starring Richard Chamberlain, features Matt Damon as an amnesiac who cant figure out why everyone wants to kill him or why he is so good at killing others. The story is involving and moves along at a nice clip. The supporting cast, featuring Chris Cooper (as a CIA Agent) and Franka Potente (as the love interest) is  good, though Julia Stiles (usualy an effective young actress) weirdly turns up in a minor role. Damon is good for the most part, though he is never entirely believable in this role.. still that doesnt stop the film from being very entertaining and action packed. GRADE: B+",8,0,1,17 June 2002
The Italian Job," Fun heist picture
","An entertaining remake of a 1969 film.. While nothing new or ground breaking the film features a likeable ensemble cast (Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron, Ed Norton, Seth Green, etal.) and some fun heist scenes.. and a really entertaining chase scene in downtown Los Angeles. Just harmless formula fun. GRADE: B",8,0,3,28 May 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Epic
","An epic film masterfully produced.. this is how big films should be. Breathtaking production design, appealing casting and characterizations and a dynamite story all roled into one. Perhaps the best film of the year, this tale based on the story by J.R.R. Tolkien is just the first part of a trilogy that will be released every xmas. Hopefully the next installments can live up to the standard set by the original. GRADE: A",10,0,0,28 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," An improvement over the second
","The trilogy concludes in this film, coming out only a few months after part 2 hit theatres with a thud. As for the concluding chapter, it's hard to review without revealing spoilers.. but it was at least better than the dreadfull part 2. Now the first half hour - 45 minutes of this one is dreadfully borring and similar to what was wrong with 'Reloaded'.. leaden dialouge, lack of story momentum..etc.. However the mid-section of the film, featuring the battle for Zion was terrific.. very exciting action sequence that woke me up and kept me interested for most of the rest of the movie. Alass, the climatic showdown with Smith at the end was a bit of a letdown in that it was abunch of supposedly cool fx shots with no emotional weight to them.. and the actual ending of the film just was such a 'what the heck' moment that it really left you wondering what the whole point was. Keanu Reeves is the lead character again, but he remains unable to deliver a convincing line read, and much of his dialouge, especially at the ending, is incredibly corny. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishbourne in this chapter get left pretty much on the sidelines and dont get to do much.. the visuals take center stage in this chapter.. though Jada Pinkett Smith is the only supporting player to come off pretty good. On the whole, it was a hit and miss affair that is an improvement over the inept part 2 but nowhere near as good as the original. Still, for technical merit, and the one terrific fight scene, I'll give it a decent grade here. GRADE: B+",7,3,5,10 November 2003
Cast Away," Hanks delivers
","A compelling central performance from Tom Hanks carries this familiar material about a man stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash. Half the film is all Hanks alone, talking to a volleyball... and yet it never gets boring. That certainly is a testament to his performance. The harrowing plane crash sequence may keep you out of the airwaves for a while though. GRADE: A",9,0,0,2 January 2001
Lilo & Stitch," Entertaining animated fable
","An entertaining animated offering from the folks at disney. This one features a crazy space mutation that crashes in hawaii and winds up being taken in (and mistaken for a dog) by a young hawaiian girl. While not overly original, this one gets points for capturing the lifestyles of hawaii fairly well and for being mostly entertaining. GRADE: B+",9,1,1,1 July 2002
Cold Mountain," Solid epic filmmaking
","Sprawling historical epic based on a book. This tale has Nicole Kidman and Jude Law as people who meet cute, kiss and then he goes off to fight in the Civil War and she sits around and longs for him for most of the rest of the movie. Sounds pretty soapy, but the film is actualy quite good.. owing to the strong acting by Kidman, Law, Renee Zellweger (as a woman who helps Kidman on the farm) and a solid group of supporting players in minor roles (including Natalie Portman, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and many others). The production is also top notch, with good cinematography, production design and all other elements. Keeps you involved and interested. A solidly produced epic. GRADE: A-",8,1,1,5 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Entertaining summer sequel
","It's been many years since Arnold Schwarzenegger last donned the trademark leather jacket in T2 and with James Cameron not involved there was reason for trepidation but the franchise is back in fine form under director Jonathan Mostow ('U-571'). Another Arnie robot is sent back in time once more to protect John Connor (Nick Stahl, wisely replacing Eddie Furlong in the part) and his potential love interest (Claire Danes in her first action part). Coming back to try to kill them is the T-X (model babe Kristianna Loken). This film features some great action sequences that blow away anything done in the overhyped 'Matrix' sequel and it's good to see Arnold back in fine form in the role he was meant to play. The 'message' of the film seems to be 'you can't escape your destiny' and it attempts to answer the questions posed in the previous films about wether or not you can truely change the future by traveling back in time. The performances are good from the cast, the direction is solid and the stunt work outstanding.  I do have a couple of quibbles with the ending, but I can't really get into that without giving away key plot points.. so I'll leave it at this.. this film is a heckof a good time and certainly better than a few of the other over hyped films that we have seen lately. GRADE: A-",9,1,1,8 July 2003
"I, Robot"," Too familiar
","This film, very loosely based on the Isaac Asimov book, has Will Smith as a police officer in the future trying to unravel the truth behind the death of a scientist who invented robotics (James Cromwell). A robot emerges as the prime suspect, something no one else will believe... and Smith winds up on the outs with his bosses... This is all pretty familiar material, owing more to 'Blade Runner' and 'RoboCop' than it does to the source material. Still, Smith is an engaging personality and the film has some fun action sequences, though the animation of the CG robots is very hit and miss. All in all though, its a very forgetable film that seems cobbled together from parts of other, better, movies. GRADE: C+",5,0,0,27 July 2004
Save the Last Dance," Appealing if somewhat formulaic tale
",An appealing if somewhat formulaic tale with dance prodigy Julia Stiles having to relocate to an inner city school after the death of her mother. She has her interest in dance rekindled thru a romance with urban youth Sean Patrick Thomas. An affecting love story that handled the interracial and interclass elements quite nicely. The stars have an appealing chemistry that helps the film mostly overcome the somewhat predictable elements of the plotline. GRADE: B,Null,0,0,22 January 2001
Spider-Man," Excellent comic book film
","This film, based on the comic books, is absolutely one of the best film versions of a comic book superhero. Sam Raimi's style and his casting choices match the tone of the early Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comics perfectly. Tobey Maguire is an excellent choice to play gawky teenager Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as the 'crush' next door is also a perfect casting choice. I'm a little less enthusiastic about Willem Dafoe's stint as the lunatic Green Goblin, but it works well enough to give Spidey a foe worth facing. The script follows the comic book origin story fairly closely, and certainly more closely than most other comics to film adaptions. While the effects work is somewhat shaky at times, it still works because we are, after all, looking at a big screen comic book. Definitely a fun film that is worth viewing. GRADE: A-",9,0,0,6 May 2002
Collateral," Good except for the ending
","Michael Mann's latest thriller has Tom Cruise cast as a hitman who rides along in Jamie Foxx's cab on his way to comit his murders. The film relies primarily on the personalities of its two leads and their interaction. And in the scenes between Cruise and Foxx the film is very good. The two of them play their parts well and have a nice dynamic that makes their conversations interesting. The film is also shot very stylishly, making good use of digital video... The film is very good up until the ending, which takes several wrong turns into 'Die Hard' territory with a silly cat and mouse bit in a highrise. Until then I was completly in the film. Jada Pinkett Smith shows up in a completly unbelievable performance as well, the films other weak point. Still, on the whole a fairly effective thriller featuring two solid lead performances. GRADE: B+",8,1,2,31 August 2004
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," A bit of a mishmash
","The third film in the Harry Potter film series, based on the book series, this time with a new director on board... with mixed results. While the first two films were visualy stunning I had found them to be a tad on the dull side with too much of the books adapted and too many somewhat dull scenes.. however this one seems to have gone the opposite route..  this film seems somewhat rushed, as though we are missing storylines.. things seemed to move too fast to have much of an impact and many of the characters, particularly the adult ones, seemed to filter in and out with little development.. Someone who missed the first two chapters and then checked in for this one would be completly lost. Not that this one is without its merits, the kid actors are developing into decent thespians and growing with their roles, and I did apreciate the slightly darker tone that this version took.. but the storyline just seemed to lurch along too much without satisfying resolutions.. they really need to kinda split the difference on the next installment.

Ocean's Eleven," Ok
","This film, a remake of the 60's era Rat Pat movie, features George Clooney as the leader of a gang of thieves trying to rip of an impenitrible vault in a vegas casino. Clooney is well cast in this role and his supporting players of Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and others are also good. As caper films go, this one is effective and keeps you entertaining most of the way thru, though i do feel that the tag at the end was unnecessary and a bit of a miscalculation. GRADE: B",7,0,1,17 December 2001
Spirited Away," Technicaly good but kinda slow
","Finaly caught this Oscar nominated film last week on videotape.. This one was nominated for Best Animated film, and is considered by many to be the favorite.. However, I was less impressed. The animation is pretty good and the story is interesting but I just wasnt all that entertained by it, finding it to be pretty slow for much of the run of the film. A technicaly impressive work, but just not really my cup of tea. GRADE: B",6,1,7,17 March 2003
Hardball," Familiar storyline, weak performance by Keanu
","This drama has down on his luck compulsive gambler Keanu Reaves having to take over a rag tag inner city baseball team. Half inspirational inner city drama, half `Bad News Bears' remake. Though based on a true story, the terrain is familiar and Keanu seems to be sleepwalking through the assignment. GRADE: C",6,1,2,7 October 2001
Resident Evil," Entertaining thrill ride
","This film, based on the popular video game, has a group of soldiers battling zombies in some kind of futuristic science lab underground.. the layout of the place was never really clear to me. However, the film is very entertaining even as it plays up the cliches of the zombie genre.  Milla Jovovich comes off well as an amnesiac who joins the soldiers as they fight the zombies, and she turns out to be a formidible fighter, even though she spends most of the film semi-naked... but hey.. works for me... The film is an entertaining thrill ride that plays like a live action video game but if you go in expecting that, you get what you wanted. GRADE: B",8,2,4,20 March 2002
The Butterfly Effect," Plot holes mar thriller
","This thriller stars 'It Boy' Ashton Kutcher as a man who has had many blackouts durring his life... and when he reads his journal he is somehow able to return to the periods where his blackouts occured and re-write history.. sending him back to the present, with everything changed. An interesting premise that doesnt really work because of some serious logic flaws.. Once he first changes an event way in the past, other events later in his life should no longer have happened.. yet they still exist in his journal and he can still return to them.. The internal logic of the film breaks down at that point.. still Amy Smart as his childhood friend/love interest does a very good job with her role which changes from suicidal to bubbly sorority girl to prostitute... all depending on what changes occur in the past.. A bit of a misfire, but an interesting one. GRADE: C-",5,0,3,26 January 2004
Remember the Titans," Splendid performance by Denzel
",A rousing true story with Denzel Washington taking over as coach of a newly integrated southern High School Football team and leading them on to glory. While somewhat formulaic in the sports movie milieu it is still a entertaining film that features yet another outstanding performance from the almost always outstanding Washington. GRADE: B+,8,1,2,29 October 2000
Blue Crush," Fun
","An entertaining formula film about a surfer girl in Hawaii (the photogenic Kate Bosworth) who is about to enter a  big surfing competition when she falls for an NFL Quarterback in the islands for the Pro Bowl (Matt Davis). As light hearted fluff goes, this one works. The love story is formula but the two leads have the requisite chemistry on screen to make it appealing and the rest of the performers are game. The surfing scenes are great, some truly breathtaking cinematography here that captures some great angles of the action.. really awesome stuff from the camera team and the stunt team of real professional surfers. A fun time at the movies for the days when you are looking for something light and breezy. GRADE: B",7,0,0,19 August 2002
The Pianist," Top flight production
","This film has received many Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, so I finally caught it on tape this weekend and have now seen all the Oscar nominees in the major categories. A tale of a Jewish pianist in Poland during World War II and how he deals with the Nazi prosecution and stays out of the concentration camps. While the film doesn't break any new ground on fairly familiar subject matter, it benefits strongly from Adrien Brody's excellent work in the title role, making you identify and root for his character as he hides from the Nazi's and tries to survive till the war ends. A solid supporting cast and excellent production values also make this a worthwhile film to see.. even though it is often bleak and depressing. GRADE: A-",9,0,2,10 March 2003
Seabiscuit," Good historical film
","An effective historical tale about the race horse SeaBiscuit, features solid work by veteran actors Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper as well as a solid turn by Tobey Maguire.. While slightly overlong (I think they could easily have trimmed down the opening historical stuff considerably) the film is involving and well made.. You are always interested in the characters and what is happening. Definitely good filmmaking here. GRADE: A-",8,0,0,5 August 2003
28 Days Later...," good arty zombie film
","Danny Boyle directed this shot on DV zombie film as though it were an art film... The Digital Video look works for the most part, creating kindof a reality TV look that sortof works.. though some of the out of focus video stuff is kinda hard to watch.. Still the story, about a man who wakes up from a coma to discover most of London has been wiped out by a plague that has turned the survivors into zombies.. is actualy pretty good.. The mostly unknown performers are capable and the suspense builds properly, as main characters become zombiefied without notice...  The second half, where the leads wind up hanging out withsome surviving (and possibly mad) military troops isnt quite as good and I was disapointed by the ending.. but the film is certainly a worthwhile experiment worth checking out. GRADE: B+",8,0,1,22 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Impressive achievement
","Ang Lee returns to his roots with this tale about a stolen sword and clashing loyalties among a group of swordfighters. In Mandarin Chinese with English subtitles, but that isn't as hard to follow as might be usual. The film is mostly about overly stylized fight sequences similar to those from 'The Matrix' and it delivers in that respect, though the action never seems at all realistic or plausible. Some surprisingly effective moments between the actors hold things together and the direction is flawless. Overall a fairly impressive achievement. GRADE: A-",9,0,0,2 January 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent continuation of the saga
","The continuation of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy is even more impressive than the first outing. The technical achievements remain spellbinding and the performances crisp. Minus the exposition of the first film, this one gets down to business from the getgo and keeps the pace going for most of the film. A few of the subplots do tend to drag a bit, but the big battle scenes are absolutely fantastic and the film is a major accomplishment. Too bad we have to wait a year for the conclusion of the saga. GRADE: A",9,0,0,1 January 2003
School of Rock," Film works despite it's star
","Finaly caught this film at a discount theatre over the weekend and was amazed to learn that Jack Black got a Golden Globe nomination for this performance.. Basicaly he plays himself.. an obnoxious wannabe rocker... only this time he cons himself to a job as a school teacher at some anonymous prep school and teaches the kids to be a rock band. Black himself is so anoying that you want to throw stuff at him after about 10 minutes of his antics.. but the film works inspite of him. The kids are really the heart of the film and they are very good, the story has some nice moments and works pretty well.. just wish Black wasn't so dispicable. GRADE: B-",5,2,4,31 December 2003
Coyote Ugly," Fun fun film
","A fun film from the Jerry Bruckheimer factory, this one has Piper Perabo (last seen in 'Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle') as a small town girl who travels to the big city of New York as an aspiring songwriter with stage fright and winds up working at the title bar, a place where supermodels dance on the bar and spray beer at the customers (and each other)... What can you really say about this film? It's story is essentially the standard small town girl makes good in the big city fable... but heck.. I really liked this movie anyways.. One of those guilty pleasure kinda things. :) GRADE: A-",10,1,2,29 October 2000
K-19: The Widowmaker," ok
","An aging and weathered looking Harrison Ford stars in this true life story as a hard ass Russian sub captain who takes over an experimental submarine from Liam Neeson and leads an expidition that gets everyone in trouble. As submarine movies go, this one is ok though we have seen many of the sequences before in better movies. The acting of Ford and Neeson is good, and certainly the film is watchable but, despite the 'true' story aspect, it definitely has a been there done that look. GRADE: B-",6,0,0,23 July 2002
Men in Black II," Galactic Misfire
","This film is loaded with silly effects sequences designed to appeal to fans of the over-rated original and it might please the less discriminating of them. But on the whole the film lacks a coherent plot and is mostly a vehicle for effects. Will Smith still offers up a smattering of wisecracks but seems more restrained this time, as if told not to upstage the effects and Tommy Lee Jones is practicaly sleepwalking this time around, without the charisma he showed in part one. A galactic misfire. GRADE: D",3,0,0,11 July 2002
Mulholland Drive," Excellent but weird
","If you are a fan of David Lynch's past works, this one defnitely fits into the same stylish realm. Full of mysterious people and situations, and all the usual bizare assortment of seemingly unconnected weirdness.. this is Lynch at his best. If you like everything to make perfect sense, skip this one, but if you like to be challenged, go see this one. GRADE: A",10,1,1,21 October 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Terrific blood bath
","Hard to review what is essentialy only half a movie since the incomplete storyline is hard to really understand.. but if you ignore things like logic and character development, and just want to enjoy some well choreographed mayhem... well this is your movie. The action scenes, which involve Uma Thurman slicing and diceing herway thru Lucy Liu and Vivicka A. Fox (among others) are top notch. Not for the squemish as blood and body parts are plentiful here.. still Tarantino here does relish his chance for cinematic bloodshead that rivals any bloodbath films of recent vintage. GRADE: B+",9,0,1,20 October 2003
Black Hawk Down," Excellent war film.
","This film, about a failed military activity in Somalia is an excellent film. From the moment the fighting starts, about a half hour into the film until the end of the movie the film doesnt let up.. you really feel the harrowing horrors of this sort of warfare. People die, things blow up and the film, with the constantly moving camera gets you right into the middle of it so that you as the viewer feel like you are right their in the bombed out cities with the actors. ThCast is made up primarily of solid performers who are recognizable but not stars whose pressence would detract from the story.. Definitely one of the years better films. GRADE: A",10,0,0,9 January 2002
The Last Samurai," Top flight production
","Period adventure tale starring Tom Cruise as a Civil War vet who travels to Japan to teach the Imperal Army modern warfare so they can fight the Samurai.. of course he soon gets captured by the Samurai and begind to apreciate their way of life. A splendidly produced epic with top flight production values. Ken Watanabe as the Samurai leader is excellent and Cruise does his best with a cliched role... While the story has some holes and the ending is a tad unrealistic, the battles are great and it certainly keeps you interested throughout. GRADE: A-",9,0,0,17 December 2003
From Hell," Stylish thriller
","A stylish take on the 'Jack the Ripper' storyline with drug addicted Inspector Johnny Depp attempting to find out who is murdering the prostitutes before they finish off the object of his affection, Heather Graham. While the identity of the killer is not really hard to figure out in this one, Depp's performance and the atmospheric touches added by directors Albert & Alan Hughes make this one fairly watchable. GRADE: B",8,0,1,29 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Good but slightly too long
","This tale, based on the popular book series, is a real accomplishment from a technical standpoint but might seem somewhat tedious to non fans of the book. Tech achievements are all excellent and the cast, both young and old, aquit themselves very well. While the film does have some outstanding sequences that keep your attention, at 2 1/2 hours the film does run a good half hour too long and often bogs down in some less than captivating sequences that slow the story down. Fans have told me that these will pay off in the sequels, but as a vieweing experience on its own, the film is just a tad too long. GRADE: B",5,0,1,9 December 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," Effects good, but characters bland
","This much anticipated sequel is somewhat of a disapointment. Weighted down with endlessly dull speechifying and political debate in the first half and overly choreographed fight scenes in the second. While many of the effects are impressive (that freeway chase is pretty cool) they lack a sense of danger since Keanu's character is now an impervious superman. The human element is also absent as the characters are all so bland that they lack any human emotion, there is zero chemistry between Keanu and Carrie Ann Moss.. a real detriment to the story.. Hopefully the concluding chapter in the winter will be more involving... Still it gets a decent grade due to impressive technical efforts and Hugo Weaving's entertaining work as Smith.. GRADE: B",6,0,0,28 May 2003
Mystic River," Excellent acting, solid film
","Another bleak drama.. this one has Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins as childhood friends who are drawn back together when Penn's daughter is kidnapped. Excellent performances all around in this film from director Clint Eastwood. The story is somewhat depressing but the actors are all so good that you really get into their characters and the storyline. GRADE: A-",8,0,0,26 January 2004
A Beautiful Mind," Crowe gives the performance of his career
","This film, from director Ron Howard, is about real life math genius John Nash (expertly played by Russell Crowe) and his decent into paranoid-schizophrenia. The film works primarily because it comes at us from Nash's point of view so we as the audience are equally shocked to discover that characters that we had seen him interacting with are nothing more than figments of his imagination. Crowe is brilliant in this part, really making what could be an overdone role in the hands of a lesser actor, in to something quite compelling. Jennifer Connelly as his long suffering wife also delivers the performance of her career. GRADE: A",8,0,2,28 December 2001
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Overlong but fun
","The second film in this film series has the same general strengths and weaknesses of the original.. The production design and effects are excellent and the cast is uniformaly good. However the storyline and film itself is overly padded and slow paced... a flaw of trying to adapt too much of the book. While this one is less padded than the original, lacking so much of the expositionary stuff, it could still have used some judicial cutting, losing a good half hour of the running time from this 2 hour and 45 minute film would have helped tighten things up enormously. Still, the film does have its entertaining moments and the young cast is getting better with each entry.It's also a hoot to see Kenneth Brannah hamming it up as one of the instructors. GRADE: B",6,0,0,25 November 2002
Ice Age," Hit and miss animation
","This animated film has it's fun moments, mostly those involving the little squirrel and his acorn, but too often falls into cliches and actually gets kinda dull for stretches, owing to the lack of interest in the lead characters. The animation is good, but not up to the level of films like 'Monsters, Inc.' or 'Shrek.'  A hit and miss effort. GRADE: C+",6,1,2,20 March 2002
The Terminal," Hanks makes so-so film worthwhile
","This film has Tom Hanks as an Eastern European visitor to New York who winds up having to live in the Airport Terminal for months due to a revolution in his homeland causing his visa to be cancelled. While the premise is far fetched and Stanley Tucci as his nemesis, head of airport security, is somewhat unbelievable.. Hanks performance is good enough to make most of the film watchable. His interactions with the airport employees and his day to day life becomes quite fascinating. Hanks charisma mostly keeps you envolved, though his flirtation with a stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones doesnt really work very well.. A hit and miss film that is worth checking out cause of Hanks. GRADE: B",7,10,20,23 June 2004
Vanilla Sky," Good but weird
","This film, directed by Cameron Crowe, features Tom Cruise in a challenging role as a cocky rich publisher who gets disfigured in a car crash that kills his sometime lover (Cameron Diaz). After that he slowly starts losing touch with reality in a confusing storyline that eventualy comes together at the end. Cruise is actualy quite good in the film, playing someone who can no longer rely on his looks and charm to get by.. Diaz in a smaller role in also good and Penelope Cruz as the object of Cruise affections for much of the film makes a fairly good impression as well.. though the story keeps shifting and turning, it does eventualy come together in a fairly interesting though out-there way. GRADE: B+",8,0,0,17 December 2001
Creed II," Solid franchise effort
","While not as good as the previous film, this one is still worth a viewing. Picking up the threads left by Creed this one is basically a sequel to Rocky IV... bringing back Dolph Lundgren, who looks terrific, as Ivan Drago who has trained his son for a shot at Creed's title. This one hits all the right beats. Stallone is still terrific in a role he has now played EIGHT (!) times, Michael B. Jordan is good as Creed and Lundgren provides more depth than he did in the original as the disgraced former boxer who is living a second chance through his son. Brigitte Nielsen even pops up in a couple of scenes, reprising her role as Drago's now ex-wife. The film hits all the predictable franchise notes but they still work.. and when the iconic Rocky theme pops up during the climatic fight scene it still stirs the heart strings. Tessa Thompson is under utilized in this one and some of the mid section drags but I liked the movie anyway.",8,3,9,22 November 2018
The Emperor's New Groove," Sillier and slighter than usual, but fun
",Sillier and slighter than your usual Disney animated fare.. this effort has a cocky young Emperor (voiced by the smarmy David Spade) getting turned into a llama by his devious advisor (voiced by the entertaining Eartha Kitt). Not much depth here but it won't bore you and it's light fun for the kids when not much of that is out right now. GRADE: B,7,0,0,2 January 2001
Bruce Almighty," Funny if predictible comedy
","Fairly funny Jim Carrey vehicle that has him as a News reporter who temporarily gets the power of God and wrecks havoc.  Carrey is back in familiar ground here and looks to be having a good time, and Jennifer Aniston as his put  upon girlfriend is also charming and affecting. The story is predictible to the extreme but the cast (including Morgan Freeman as 'God') is great and makes the film worth catching. GRADE: B",8,0,0,28 May 2003
Signs," Very good until the ending.
","This latest thriller is from director M. Night Shyalmanan and has many of his trademark touches. This story is basicaly 'Independance Day' old from the perspective of an isolated farmhouse.. you get all the old standby alien invasion angles, but you are so cut off from the main story and forced to focus on this one family that it gets scarier by implication. The atmospheric touches and the total absence of underscore for much of the film add to the fear and suspense factor that ratchets up till the end of the world scenerio plays itself out. Mel Gibson as an emotionaly damaged former preacher and father of two young children is good in an underplayed role as is Joaquin Phoenix as his former minor-league ballplayer brother. The film is good for long stretches before finaly falling apart at the end and failing to live up to it's expectations. GRADE: B",7,1,4,12 August 2002
Identity," Terrible ending spoils film
","This suspense thriller stars Jon Cusack, Ray Liotta and assorted others as strangers with an unlikely connection that all get stranded at an isolated motel durring a rainstorm... and get killed off one by one.. Technicaly this film looks great and carries the suspense quite well.. That is until an utterly preposterous twist near the ending that renders everything that follows utterly meaningless. I HATED the ending of this film with such a passion that it spoiled the fact that I had really enjoyed the film up untill that point. GRADE: D",5,3,7,30 April 2003
X2: X-Men United," Entertaining super hero film
","An entertaining super hero action film, that I enjoyed more than the original. Basicaly the plot has a sinister figure in the U.S. Government manipulating the President to try to wipe out the mutants once and for all... so they launch an assault on the X-Mansion and the X-Men wind up having to scatter and try to fight back. All the actors from the original film return and are joined here by a few other X-Men that have been brought in from the comics. A fairly faithfull rendition of the comic book storylines featuring decent acting and entertaining fight scenes (something lacking from the original). Halle Berry and Famke Janssen have more to do this time, Anna Paquin has less.. but the focus remains on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Patrick Stewart's Professor X. Still, it was vastly entertaining.. better than the original. GRADE: B+",8,0,0,15 May 2003
Amélie," Creative and amusing
","I was somewhat skeptical about attending this film due to my dislike of foreign films, however my friend Dawn Brooks dragged me along to see this one and I was pleasantly surprised. Therefore she made me promise to mention her in my review. As to the film itself, it's an entertaining if somewhat offbeat tale about a young woman's life that kept me entertained enough that i wasn't overly bothered by the subtitles. The lead actress is quite good and the film itself is very creative and often quite funny.  GRADE: A-",9,0,1,9 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Terrific conclusion to epic trilogy
","The concluding chapter in Peter Jackson's epic trilogy... this one continues the excellent production values and lush storytelling of the previous installments and wraps things up quite nicely... a shame really that the series has to end here.. the actors have really gotten into their parts by this time and the performances, particularly by Sean Astin are top flight... some terrific battles towards the end highlight the drama as well.. Not much to complain about, if i must quibble the ending tends to drag a tad.. still terrific filmmaking. GRADE: A",9,0,0,31 December 2003
Thirteen Days," compelling dramatization of the events of the Cuban Missile crisis
","A compelling dramatization of the events of the Cuban Missile crisis told thru the eyes of JFK's advisor Kenneth O'Donnell (Kevin Costner, making an attempt at a Boston Irish accent that doesn't always work). Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK really steal the show here with stellar performances that get you inside these two complicated men. Director Ronald Donaldson keeps the pace moving and the tension high and you can feel what it must have been like inside the white house at this crucial juncture of history. Minor quibble, a few unnecessary scenes of Kevin Costner with his family don't work and only serve to slow the story down. That's just a minor flaw though, the film is very effective. GRADE: A-",10,0,0,2 January 2001
Honey," Silly formula claptrap
","A formula yarn with Jessica Alba (of TV's 'Dark Angel') as a young girl in Brooklyn whose goal is to have an inner city dance studio... she winds up being a music video dancer and then a choreographer seemingly overnight due to a sudden friendship with a sleazy video producer... and then she winds up having to put on a show with the neighborhood kids to get the dance studio... About as formula as you can get... but watchable because of Alba's genuine likeability.. Still, pretty silly stuff. GRADE: C-",4,0,2,17 December 2003
Gangs of New York," Great period film
","This period piece is set durring gang conflicts in New York city durring the period of the Civil War. Director Martin Scorsese and his production team have done a wonderful job with the period florishes, creating a film that is great to look at. Daniel Day-Lewis as the 'bad guy' of the piece chews the scenery a bit much but is still good in his role and Leonardo DiCaprio as the young hood trying to take him down is also good. Cameron Diaz in kindof a thankless role as a woman whom has been involved with both men, does her best with an underwritten part. This film also features some tremendous fight scenes and is a very solid production that works very well. GRADE: A",10,0,0,1 January 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," Solid suspense film
","A sequel to 'The Bourne Identity' and also based on the stories by Robert Ludlum , this film brings back Matt Damon as the former CIA assasin with only vague memories of his past. In this effort, he returns from seclusion after he is framed for the murder of some government agents. The film is not quite as good as the first, lacking the originality of the original as well as the mystery elements.. However Damon remains quite good in this role and gets some able supporting work from Brian Cox and Joan Allen as competing government agents. Julia Stiles, who has a brief role in the previous film, has a more substantial role here.. but doesnt really register. Some of the editing of the action sequences was a little distracting, but overall it was a rather enjoyable film.GRADE: B+",7,0,2,27 July 2004
Rock Star," Predictible but ok story
",An ok story about a Heavy Metal fan (Mark Wahlberg) who amazingly gets to take over as lead singer of his favorite band. Pretty standard formula stuff here that hits all the predictible bases. Benefits from solid performance from Wahlberg. The funniest moment is an outtake durring the closing credits where the audio playback people played one of Wahlberg's old 'Marky Mark' songs and everyone cracks up. GRADE: C+,7,0,2,21 October 2001
