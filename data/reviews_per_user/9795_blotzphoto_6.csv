Aquaman," Best movie in the DCEU.
","Now, may be one of the best movies of 2018, but did have a thing with the 'Black Manta' thing. The action is amazing, the effects were great, this was a fun time. Black Manta just didn't work out, now not the worst, but he had less screen time and it feels weird how that Black Manta didn't win again aquaman, when he has way more power.
