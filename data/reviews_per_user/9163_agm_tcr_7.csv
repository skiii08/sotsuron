Ford v Ferrari," Racing with a soul
","As a Ferrari fan I was pleasantly on the side of a Ford driver, all because of the soul Christian Bale was able to portrayed as Ken Miles, a sports car racing engineer who's hart was beaten in unison with an engine of a race car. Aside of the fact that he lose several kg for the role, but being a method actor it cling a viewer to the screen. Excitement and rage can be feel in every scene. The passion take us to the circuit and made us push the accelerator. What I miss is the surprise of the plot since I knew the story. The cast is brilliant, and finally in one Americans movie I have the pleasure to see casted Italians brilliants actor for the roles of the Ferrari Team, speaking perfect Italian, as oppose as being disappointed when they cannot.

Bohemian Rhapsody," Queen let themselves die by limited Freddy
","I waited for this for very long, and then I waited until the last note and the first light.
Yes, I wanted to jump up and down at the power of Malek portrait of Freddy larger than life stage craft. Yes I crying at the intensity of how Malek stole the soul of Freddy.
But I still waited for what the Queen hide about Freddy.
Someone said is because is Bohemia Rhapsody that represent them, No the song was written music and lyric by Freddy who direct them into it.
Someone said was portrait the Queen as whole. No, the Queen were Freddy Mercury.
That's what has being missing, Freddy Mercury was larger then life showman, artist, voice, talented musician, and this piece is missing in the movie.
The Queen effort to be bigger than that reduce their value as a band support of such an icon!
But the movie is very much worth, and shouldn't be dismiss. The directing is brilliant, the picture is art, the editing is a masterpiece. Those effort should get at least some nomination as well as the great talent of Malek. The casting is superior.I rated Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) 8/10 #IMDb",8,0,0,2 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Wild West with a twist
","Tarantino violence is cathartic. The sort of scene, that after a very tense period, made the viewer jumping up and punching fends the air. The horror of the action and consequences is empowered under Tarantino, who do not direct, but choreographs a dance of flash, knifes, bloods, flames.
Margot Robbie beautifully interprets Sharon Tate in her short Hollywood life, wife of a controversial Director Roman Polanski, a young actress at the start of her career, who was consider a sweet lovely person by all in Hollywood, and was tragically killed along with some guess, in her 9th month of pregnancy, in a brutal gruesome attack in her house, by drug addict of a Satanist cult.
Partial of Tate story evolved and cross the acting career of a struggle actor, portraits skilfully by Leonardo Di Caprio, and his stage stunt, magically performed by the consumed acting of Brad Pitt, who unsurprisingly made so easy every scene he play. The three stories cross while the audience are all rapt by every frame, trying to find Tarantino personal addition that are part of his cinematographic style and signature. Tarantino and the cast gave 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' so much more, taking highly skilled cast across a changeover of a cinema era. The movie have already won golden globe awards and is on his way to get very deserved academy awards within the 10 nomination.

Joker," It's a joke? No! So why are you laughing?
","Why the Joker? Everybody collaborate excellently to give a past to one of the most loved villan, The Joker! The brilliant idea of the screenplay take the soul of one of millions, in a society, which try to grin the poor soul already down, in the huge injustice society machine, and the director and cast unfolded violently but poetically in front of our eyes his transformation in every sequences in a heartless criminal, ladies and gentlemen The Joker, mastered by the fine acting of Joaquin Phoenix.

Jojo Rabbit," Under a regime everybody act
","When I approached to see it I was feeling cranky that I had to stomach another Hitler movie, which it is, but it's also a parodie, the hero is a 10 year old boy who's character is brilliantly portrayed by Roman Griffin Davis, who try to deal with his nazi brainwashed being and love. You cannot laugh never at this kind of parodies, after all is another story, probably true, but you can smile and in the end feel relieved. Good cast, it give a glimpse in the world of general psychopathy of a nation under regime, where everybody has to act the role or being killed, but most of all, when children are used to destroy as weapon, the director master the absurdity of the horror into a fine amusement, Hopefully to let hatred knows how good a satire they can be.
And after all is a story that, despite being another hazy regime story, must be told, again, especially now.",7,0,1,14 January 2020
