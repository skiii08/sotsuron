Alien 3," Disappointing
","It's a shame they ruined the Alien movie franchise with this third installment. The direction and photography is good (David Fincher), but everything else is pretty awful. Killing all the characters from Aliens, even Ripley, kills the movie for me. The first two had amazing characters, this movie replaces them with undeveloped, bland prisoners whose main contribution is to beef up the language rating and serve as cannon fodder for the alien. The only characters that stand out are killed off too early. And what's the point of this story anyhow? The plot is much like the plot of the first movie, the scenes with the alien are not scary and there is no suspense, thanks to the lack of characters the audience cares about.Overall this movie was a major disappointment, it not only failed to live up to the high standards of its predecessors, but it paved the way for a further decline of this once promising franchise.",Null,431,451,10 June 2008
