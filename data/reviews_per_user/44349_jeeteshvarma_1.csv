","Action scenes and climax was awesome.that too in 3D cant express in words..... Really superb. 3D effects are SO enjoyable. All avengers characters showed very neatly and given importance too each one excellently.they made the importance of every avenger in fighting sequences. Direction and screenplay was mind-blowing. Story also well prepared that creating the importance of each avenger. Hulk smashing, iron man flying, Thor strengths,captain America stunts and protecting, hawk eye arrow shooting, black widow fighting skills are excellent.And mixing up of comedy scenes and dialogs in action also great fully enjoyable..... Don't miss it. The Avengers assemble. Totally the movie will give full excitement and heart full enjoyment",10,3,8,29 April 2012
