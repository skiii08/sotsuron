Blade Runner 2049," Sucked the big one. WAY, WAY, WAY over-hyped.
","A whole lot of nothing. For the most part it looked like something a STONER (Yes I am old) put together in his garage while doing what a STONER does best. For me it didn't get interesting until about an hour and a half into the movie and by then it didn't really matter anymore anyway. It doesn't do the original justice at all. Save your money, see the original and maybe, just maybe in another 35 years somebody will make a sequel worth spending your hard earned money on.",2,10,20,28 October 2017
