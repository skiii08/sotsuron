10 Cloverfield Lane," Absolutely awesome!
","I have just finished watching this movie and I'm completely freaking out! I think I will need several days to assimilate all what I watched on it. I don't know where I should start but the only word that comes to mind right now is wow! wow! wow! Story, characters, direction, the whole film is a f***ing masterpiece! Totally unexpected, everything will change in the story and you will hooked on it immediately. I have been watching a lot of movies lately and of course, I have never watched anything like this in my entire life. Regarding the acting I don't know who is the best one in the performance. Both, John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are absolutely impressive so I will only do it... clap! clap! clap!Nothing more to say... just run to the movies and watch it!",9,1,4,14 May 2016
Fury," Fury: An unexpected and dramatic war movie
","One of the latest films that Hollywood released during the last year was Fury. This movie is about five American soldiers who fight during the World War Second against the Nazi regimen with a tank called Fury. This movie was the first war movie that Brad Pitt starred in after Inglorious Bastards thus the expectation created about his performance was more than justified. As far as I am concerned, his actuation is pretty satisfactory as usual. With regard to the movie itself, it cannot be considered only as another war movie because it has been produced under a completely different point of view. As many other war movies, it contains enough violence and strong scenes for war filmgoers but considering others aspect, it is not the typical American movie in which Americans always win. Among all the violent scenes mentioned before, there is an extra space for dramatic situations and hilarious moments that provoke a deep contrast between fun and war. This contrast can be appreciated in the magical touch that Brad Pitt gives in the production. The only thing that spectators might miss in the movie is the lack of a good soundtrack and that is what makes the difference between a good movie and a masterpiece. To sum up, I have no hesitation to recommend you this remarkable film. It deserves each pound you have paid for watching it.",9,5,11,1 August 2015
Inside Out," INSIDE OUT: What an original and impressive movie.
","At first sight, I thought this movie was going to be another animation movie like thousands of them but I was completely wrong. What such a fantastic and original movie!I had to take a little time to get used to each character and their personality. At first, I didn't know what character was talking about, but after that brief moment you'll hooked on the movie.The plot is about the thoughts and feelings which are inside of the mind of a little 12 years old girl and how these feelings are represented by each one of the characters that appears in the story: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear. Each one of these characters has been pretty well represented and characterised being so easy to identify yourself with one of them. You will love it!The story will take you into different stages, involving each character mentioned above. The movie has everything and you will feel that anger, joy, fear, sadness and disgust of the little girl and her feelings. My recommendation is preparing some Kleenex for the final part of the movie. You will probably need it. It is difficult for me to express what this movie represents. It is completely different to other animation films. Just run to watch it. It deserves each minute. Looking forward to watching the second part of Inside Out! I really hope Walt Disney is working on it!",9,6,31,5 October 2015
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The hobbit: A truly unexpected movie
","Pretty good movie. I'm not fan of these kinds of fantastic movies at all and I have not read the book of J.R.Tolkien but I should say that this is a good one. Characters very well defined, marvelous scenes and landscapes and a plot in which you will easily keep focused on. And of course, superb special effects. It can be a little bit hard to get used of the names and nomenclature of all the fantastic creatures of the movie, but once the movie goes on you will not be worried about that anymore. Without any hesitation I strongly recommend watching it. Let's see weather the second part of The Hobbit is as good as this one or not.",8,0,2,21 July 2015
Ex Machina," Ex Machina: The unexpected AI movie
","I really don't know how to classify this film. It's a totally surprising movie with an unexpected end. The plot is about a code programmer (Caleb) who wins a programme competition and is invited to spend some days with his CEO (Nathan) at a far house located in a place only accessible by helicopter. Being there he realized that his CEO is carrying out a series of tests with robots which have an impressive and unbelievable artificial intelligence. This fact provokes that the boy end up having a real feeling with such a beautiful robot girl (Ava). Step by step those feelings start to confuse the boy more and more that makes the boy to think about if he is in reality a human being or robot. With regard to the production of the movie, it can be said that is very well filmed and it has something else that don't have others. It has overwhelming and thought-provoking scenes. You will end up thinking about if it is possible the current AI may achieve those high levels that provokes in you such confusion. What make this film so interesting it the fact that there are not many similar movies to this one. Others AI movies are presented in a completely different way. To sum up, this movie couldn't be considered as a masterpiece, but with no hesitation, it should be a 'must' in your next films to watch. It's hard to put some adjectives but undoubtedly unexpected is the word which fits best.",8,1,4,25 July 2015
Prisoners," Prisoners or how to feel a real desperation
","What such an impressive and emotional movie. Everything in the film is completely outstanding. We can start with the casting of actors in which the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal as Detective Loki is marvelous and finishing with an extraordinary Hugh Jackman as Keller Dover, father of one of the kidnapped girls. I feel that I'm in debt with this character because it is one of the best acting I've ever seen on the big screen. His desperation for finding his daughter is so real that you will feel the tension during the whole film. According to what I've read Hugh Jackman even spent several nights without sleeping in order to make that impression during the shooting of the film. On the other hand, the plot cannot be more interesting and intriguing so you will see yourself trying to figure out who is the responsible of the disappearance of the little girls. Despite kidnapping of kids in Hollywood movies are pretty common, the production and direction of Prisoners is completely different. I don't usually give points easily on this website but I will do an exception with this one because I ended up totally impressed and open-mouthed. I gave nine points without any kind of hesitation. I'm looking forward to watching the next part of Prisoners because the ending of the film lead to believe that there will be a second part. I strongly recommend you to watch it. It deserves every minute.",9,1,2,17 October 2015
The Martian," The Martian. In the middle of disappointing and enjoyable movie.
","The expectations and the critics for this were being extremely high thus I decided to go to the movies in order to check if the movie lives up to those expectations. I even opted for watching it in 3D. The result, I cannot be more disappointed. I cannot say that it is a bad movie in the terms of a boring film or something like that, because is not. However, there are too many unbelievable scenes. I don't want to specify one to one but for example, the latest ones when Matt Damon seems Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story... what the F***! The movie is even enjoyable, I don't have any objections to that and it even liked me but there too many 'but'. I have the sensation that this movie could have reached the honorable term of masterpiece without those 'but'. It's a shame and I feel disappointed for that. To sum up, if you want to spend a good time I recommend watching it but having in mind that the movie is more close to the comedy gender rather than sci-fi.",6,1,4,18 October 2015
