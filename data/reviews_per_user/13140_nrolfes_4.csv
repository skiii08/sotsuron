The Blair Witch Project," Scarier Than Any Splatter Movie Could Ever Be!
","I went to see this movie without knowing very much about it. When it started I first was pretty bored: Why the hell did I spent my money on that? But then the film started to work on my psyche. By the end I was glued to my seat, cold showers running down my back. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT accomplishes all that without fancy special effects. In fact, you don't get to see anything scarier that an out-of-focus shot of blood stained teeth, and sometimes the screen simply goes blank for half a minute leaving only sound. The horror of the movie is created within your mind. And that's why it runs deeper than any violent splatter movie could ever do. The unknown actors do a fine job and attribute greatly to the believability of the film, which never would have worked starring Brad Pitt, for example. Go see for yourself.",10,1,2,6 February 2000
The Blair Witch Project," Shivers Down Your Spine
","More than any splatter movie this film sends ice cold shivers down your spine. It does so by not showing any on screen violence, without fancy special effects, and by keeping the screen dark and the pictures out of focus for several minutes, never leaving its mockumentary style. I loved it.",10,1,2,1 December 1999
When Harry Met Sally...," A Modern Classic
","What's a perfect comedy? - It should be funny, of course, but it should also be sad at moments, it should be romantic, and it should have something to say about life and people.'When Harry Met Sally...' has it all: You can roll on the floor laughing, when Sally (Meg Ryan) fakes her orgasm at the restaurant. You can cry, when Harry (Billy Crystal) walks the streets of New York City on New Year's Eve feeling lonely and finally realising that he's in love with Sally. Romance is all around, when the documentary couples tell their stories of how they met. And isn't it true that love and sex always come in the way in a friendly relationship between men and women?This is one of my all time favourite movies. I must have seen it al least ten times, and I still enjoy it.",10,0,1,2 December 1999
The Matrix," Best Thriller Of 1999
","The mind-bending special effects alone make this movie worth watching. Just as Industrial Lights and Magic changed the visual concept of sci-fi movies with the Star Wars trilogy, THE MATRIX adds Bullet Time, a stunning new way to move the perspective of the camera during a slow motion or time compression or even a still frame shot, to film making. Above that THE MATRIX is an action packed thriller starring that captures you from the very first scene and keeps you glued to your seat until the end. I predict that it will reap quite a few Oscars at the next Academy Awards.",10,0,0,1 January 2000
