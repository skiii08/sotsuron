The Rock," Bang average
","I will take the unusual route of cutting and pasting someone who likes the movie, 'This movie is a great movie with great acting, a great plot, and great... well everything. If you want a movie that will keep you on the edge of your feet and will keep you entertained for two hours then choose the Rock. Not only is it action packed but it also has an excellent plot which lots of action movies need. Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage were great!!! ' Great plot, great script, great acting, sorry no, this is a film which tries to by a modern Indiana Jones set in Alcatraz in fact they borrow Indiana Jones's dad Sean Connery {why do they have him in this film born in Glasgow when he was born in Edinburgh?} , what is missing decent script, any emotional connection to the characters. The action scenes are set plays heavily cut, the film simply filled time.",3,1,5,15 September 2014
In Bruges," Brilliant
","I will kick of the review by quoting another reviewer a bad review to illustrate that some people simply do not know what they are talking about, 'One thing I am really sick of in English-language movies (not only this one) is all these Continental European supporting characters with absolutely flawless English, in this case Colin Farrell's enormously annoying Belgian love interest. Not only do they never make any mistakes, they speak the language so brilliantly that they can hold their own in witty conversations with native speakers, firing from a sparkling repartee that includes puns on English words that I assume wouldn't work in their own language. How about making a movie for a change in which Belgians, Germans, Italians, etc. speak English the way they really do, i.e. BADLY? Of course, no explanation is ever given why they speak English so well. Usually one of the native-speaker characters just makes a stupid surprised face and says something like 'Wow, your English is really good', and that's that. On to the next pun.' In Europe they often do speak flawless English often better than the British, this film is simply wonderful on so many levels, great script, brilliant acting. Colin Farrell deserves every accolade for his role, I would encourage anyone to watch this wonderful film.",10,1,2,18 November 2016
Argo," OK its not that accurate
","If we park the liberties taken with actual historical events and some reviews on this site read more like a doctorate on American foreign policy than a review on the film. So lets leave the fact the Canadians not the CIA were the driving force and the British embassy actually sheltered the escapees, what do we have as a film? This did the one thing I want on a Saturday night it was entertaining, good story line, the actors carry the story convincingly, good pace and a sharp as a tack script, my favourite line is 'at least they will be confused when their torturing you' I know some people are hung up on it not being historically correct but I love Blade Runner and it bears little resembles to Phillip K Dick's novel Do Androids dream of electric sheep which I also love, both stand as works in their own right I believe this film stands as a work in its own right. Go and enjoy.",7,0,2,19 March 2013
"I Love You, Man"," Bang average and not that funny.
","Story written by John Hamburg & Larry Levin about Billy no mates, I think he is called John Rudd,attempt to find a best man for his wedding. Enter Jason Segal as his new mate and hilarity takes place or should have with a decent script. Not the worst film in the world but instantly forgettable. The lead character is simply annoying and who in their right minds trawls the internet looking for friends? The problem is the characters and their motivations are so unlike real life to make it neither fish nor fowl, a pretty unfunny comedy. The only redeeming feature is the gorgeous Jamie Pressley from My Name is Earl now that is funny.",4,0,2,17 December 2014
Concussion," Enjoyed
","Having suffered 'London is fallen' recently, any film will resemble Citizen Kane. This film had good acting a serious topic and thankfully no people shouting and blowing up things. It tackles the problem of repeated blows to the head experienced in the NFL and the NFL trying to suppress the science, I am not sure why it took so long to realise having your brain rattled around on a constant basis would not be good for you, . What is good the acting Will Smith is excellent and the support cast contribute, it is a bit plodding and a bit disjointed but overall not too bad, could have been edited a little better to make it sharper and with better continuity.",6,1,4,20 November 2016
Black Mass," Makes you love films again.
","I would love to sit the makers of all the god awful films I have endured in the last few years, the film I got up and stormed out to find myself in the rain in my garden in the rain and thinking I would rather stand in the cold rain than watch the rest of the film. This film has everything these films miss, beautiful photography, great acting, good pace, excellent script. This is a true story of one of South Boston's most wanted criminal, this is a version of events, some question whether it is entirely factual, it really does not matter, treat yourself enjoy this wonderful film, Johhny Depp is brilliant, he does not go overboard but the menace is bubbling away.",10,0,5,25 March 2016
Interstellar," Good not great
","I love Sci-Fi movies but I like them believable if that is not a total oxymoron, so this was right up my street, what did I like, the start of the film was brilliant of an Earth ravished by failing crops and people battling against this plight and still carrying on a day to day existence, I think there was a movie in this alone. I enjoyed the cinematography the sound track and interesting story which at times gave a serious nod to Space Oddity. I also feel there is a movie to be made about when we contact an alien race without them wanting to conquer Earth about how we cope if things we believe in are shown to be false. Back to the movie what did I dislike, Matthew McConaughey mumbling his way through the movie maybe it's my English ears but I usually have the sound at 15-20 for a movie to try to decipher what he was saying we had the sound racked up to 80 so I guess the sound quality did not transfer to the small screen. The story I think was a bit to convoluted but overall a decent film if not a great film.",7,0,2,19 April 2015
Bird Box," Very enjoyable but why do people think this is a horror movie
","Enjoyed the film great acting, moody quite a view plot holes, running through a wood with two children blindfolded? the creature, creatures can not enter houses a bit like vampires having to be invited into the house. No one at any point discusses what the creatures are or their origin. Despite this a movie with a story and ending, people are complaining about the lack of ending think we have a sequel.",8,1,4,1 January 2019
Jackie," Boring
","It must take some doing the assassination of JFK and reduce to the level of boredom the viewer has to endure for one and a half hours. I really struggled to find a reason the film was made it just seemed to drift along and then end, my wife asked 'Is that it?' sadly yes. I think Natalie Portman did an OK job with a awful script and the soundtrack was too loud and dreary. I am trying to understand what they wanted to convey, was it that Jackie was pretty much self absorbed? The whole thing just plods along a bit like the scene were she plods through the Arlington cemetery mud. They also missed the moving scene were the son salutes the coffin, this film unfortunately is not worth your wasted time watching it.",3,1,3,3 December 2017
22 Jump Street," Boring
","This is a really boring movie, we watched it at home and after about 10 minutes started to talk through it, I never watched Jump21 street so I guess I missed out on some of the in jokes. Reading other reviews apparently this is a verbatim reproduction of the first film. I laughed once or twice but then again I laugh more at what people say at work. Plot seems a bit stretched and for unfunny lines we will shout them because that makes it funny. I except films and the actions of the actors will not be a mirror of real life as they would be even more boring as films but this seems to an absurd concept, I am from England so don't have a full knowledge of the American education system but sending what appears to be two blokes in their 30's back to school to be undercover police just does not work and then so fat small one copping off with a fit college girl is even more odd. Tatum Channing spends the film looking being bored or hacked off. This is one boring, unfunny movie.",2,1,3,26 December 2014
Ex Machina," Claustrophobic
","Really enjoyed this film the acting is tremendous and is held together by a wonderful performance by Alicia Vikander. A lot of reviewers have compared this to Blade Runner, the difference is that Blade Runner is more an action film while this is a more a film on reaction. What makes us human? what is artificial intelligence, there is only 4 main protagonists and each holds their own, the ending is good and thought provoking. Not a lot of films leave you thinking or leave an emotion, this is one of them with its unremitting claustrophobia, there are plot holes, but show me a film were everyone acts with perfect logic. Films of people watching TV sitting with a beer are not that entertaining.",8,0,2,26 December 2015
The Witch," Not a horror.
","This film has a lot going for it, excellent acting, some beautiful cinematography, this showed the vastness of the 17th century wilderness and the claustrophobic living conditions. I think films set in this time frame work better as it was a time when gods and devils seemed real to the uneducated people of the time. I did not find this a horror movie but did find it disturbing, some of claimed it is anti religious which it is to a degree showing the nonsense of inherited sin and the tosh of needing someone to redeem these sins. The film is based in 17th century America and the early Puritans, one family is forced out and sets up a house in the wilderness. I am not sure the film needed a demonic element but could have stood alone as a film showing religious hysteria prevalent at the time.",7,3,6,29 January 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Why?
","So lets tackle the elephant in the room, here we have aliens who can turn back time on Earth, so if they do that on Earth they must do the same for every planet in our solar system and the sun, also everything in our galaxy and universe. These creatures were called gods in biblical times, so these masters of space and time have angry steel wool balls as foot soldiers? What I enjoyed in the movie, the landing on the beach which showed the chaos and carnage with a nod to several D-day movies, good action scenes, good special effects. What did I not enjoy, Tom Cruise who I always think beneath his bonhomie exterior has some thing icy at his core seems pretty bored by it all, I appreciate he has to give the appearance of tedium as each day is repeated but he displays all his emotional acting skills from A to B. I have rarely observed such a lack of chemistry between the leading man and woman as displayed in this movie. I enjoy science fiction but I like it a bit more believable if that is not an oxymoron, this movie is simply so unbelievable it struggles to keep attention between set piece action scenes, not a horrendous movie but not that good.",5,1,6,23 March 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Laugh out loud
","Never realised it was three hours and got to bed at 2.00pm but it was worth it, everything I enjoy in a film, intelligent script good pace, a story line and best is DiCaprio. For the film he must make himself likable which given the character who is a drug fuelled, thief and misogynist takes some doing but he pulls it off. The other characters, Jonah Hill, really excellent as his sidekick while Matthew McConaughey is mesmerising and the stunning Margot Robbie is fantastic.The story, the down fall of a corrupt stockbroker and the hedonistic lifestyle. This film has laugh out loud moments. Treat yourself and watch.",9,1,2,19 October 2014
