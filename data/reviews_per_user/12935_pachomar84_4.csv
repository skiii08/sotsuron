Your Name.," One of the best stories you will ever watch
","I watched this movie when it was released on Netflix mostly because of all the reviews praising so much. I didn't knew the director, studio or whoever was involved.
From the first minutes, I became amazed on such a fresh and original 'situation' (not gonna reveal spoilers), but the premise was good enough to make a decent, funny anime. Yet, when the movie goes on, you are presented with a way more complex, intriguing, breath taking moments, not to mention the last 20 minutes, which literally will have your heart pounding and probably crying
The characters are extremely well developed, the scenarios are excellently drawn, animated, the soundtrack for the most comic/dramatic events...everything is just excellent. 
This movie will probably become a cult on its own, I still can't believe that such a good story was told in less than two hours, I've seen animes of 25 or so episodes that are not even close",10,2,4,5 January 2018
Hereditary," EXTREMELY Overrated (summarized plot, spoilers galore)
","Ok, so I was so looking forward to watch this, since the critics in Sundance called it 'The Excorcist' of our era, so much people rated it like the best horror movie in years, an so on. So, I watched with really high expectative. Here's what I saw:
<ul><li>We have a family of mother, father, son and daughter, who start the movie in the grandma's funeral</li><li>Grandma liked to do small models of houses, rooms, people and stuff (or did she? it's not completely clear, but it's the only reason that would explain the movie title, since that's the only thing the mom has in common with the grandma)</li><li>We are introduced to the weird looking daughter, who likes to chop dead pigeon's head (only one, not like she had a collection or something)</li><li>Weird daughter doesn't have friends, she sleeps in a tree-house for some reason, and has a couple of visions of her dead grandma (nothing really scary, just some kind of light that hints?</li><li>The son wants to go to a high-school party and mom forces him to take the daughter, you know, cuz she doesn't have friends and doesn't want his son to drink</li><li>Son doesn't drink but gets high, and the daughter eats some chocolate cake that creates an allergic reaction (daughter is allergic to peanuts)</li><li>Son, high af, rushes her to the hospital we guess, instead of calling 911. Daughter is choking in the back seat so she opens the window to breathe and, in a very 'unpredictable' way, the son has to avoid a crash, accidentally making the girl lose her head against a pole (this one was a bit surprising, I thought the girl would have a bit more protagonism seeing the trailers)</li><li>Mom grieves her daughter and goes to a group therapy to cope with it, where she meets a nice lady who lost a son and a grandson</li><li>Said nice lady tells the mom she went to a medium and could talk to her grandson. She invites mom to her house and demonstrate that it is true (using a glass and a chalkboard)</li><li>Mom tries to contact the dead daughter, with her husband and son, and succeeds, but daughter's spirit seems to be kinda pissed (a glass is break during the medium session, so we guess)</li><li>Dunno if it's relevant, but mom sleep-walks, and we are told that once she woke up having his son covered in gas and her having a light up match in the past (ok?)</li><li>Son starts having hallucinations, not creepy ones (he sees himself into a glass smiling at himself. The most serious one has him half body paralyzed in his class and smashing his face on the table)</li><li>Mom hears sounds and goes to the attic, only to find a body, which she presumes to be the grandma (it has no head so we don't know). She asks her husband to go check it. Honestly the husband is the only real character we see in the movie 'Why didn't you call the police?' he asks, and mom sets him on fire (?)</li><li>Previously, mom found a photo album of her mother (grandma) in which the nice lady who thought her to contact the death shows up (was she a ghost?, she knew her from before?, what were they up to?)</li><li>The only 'mystery' is when the mom finds a page on one of grandma's books talking about 'a demon who has to posses a male body', cuz the demon is male....)</li><li>After mom sets husband on fire, she goes after her son, who's still confused (as we all are I guess) of wtf is happening. He hides himself in the attic until mom appears hanging in front of him while stabbing herself to death</li><li>Son leaves the house and goes to the tree-house were the dead sister used to sleep. He finds himself with bodies with their heads covered up by bags, and a voice saying he's the incarnation of the demon they were waiting for (apparently, the dead sister was the first incarnation, but since she was female, she had to die)</li><li>Son, confused af, is being praised from the bodies, still with heads covered by bags, celebrating for the 'incarnation'</li><li>Camera goes away showing the scene as if it is some kind of closure, and credits roll</li></ul>Honestly, this is the longest review I ever wrote, but I feels that the disappointment I felt after watching this deserved it. Who in hell is saying this is the new 'Excorcist'? It doesn't have the horror, the tension, the disturbing scenes (the most disturbing I saw was the 3 seconds of the dead sister's head on the road covered by ants, and it wasn't as disturbing as seeing the possessed girl using a crucifix on her 'private parts', scene that still haunts me nowadays). Honestly, this movie tried to do a lot and didn't really delivered on anything. I guess that if a horror movie doesn't rely on jumpscares nowadays its supposed to be good, but this wasn't the case. I hope this review helps other viewers",1,3,9,6 July 2018
Bird Box," A two hour build up with an very poor ending
","Ok, so I'm not gonna jump in the 'it's a ripoff from 'A quiet place', even though the setup is VERY similar and, even if this is based on a much older book, the timing to release a movie like this doesn't feel like a coincidence. Anyway....
I think the most unsatisfying things of this movie are:
A) We never get to see the 'creatures', I know it's part of the mystery and stuff, but at least we could have a quick glance by the end of the movie of something....al we see is leaves rising from the ground (and some drawing from one of the characters who actually saw them)
B) Most of the characters are cliche and don't really matter except from the protagonist couple. We are presented with like 10 people from who the whole importance is that one of them is also pregnant (boy, I wonder who are the two children with Sandra Bullock back to '5 years later' when the film starts
C) The ending. So they reach this blind people school, ok cool, blind people are immune to the creatures, so they are gonna stick there forever? is that the happy ending? will they have enough supplies for all the people forever in this house in the middle of nowhere? This feels like a really loose end, kinda like the author didn't know how to conclude the story
If you have to choose, watch 'A quiet place', similar premise, but much better achieved, better monster (yes, we get to see them) and the acting overall is much better",2,13,26,24 December 2018
Call Me by Your Name," Maybe I'm missing info from the book?
","Ok, honestly, I just watched this movie with really high spectations because of the comments, the nominations and such. I gotta say, it's far from being as good as people say
First, let me start with Oliver. I know Armie Hammer had a contract that limited the sex scenes, but did he also include he would play a poor believable closeted gay? His scenes with Elio don't seem to have any spark at all (from his side, the kid playing Elio makes a wonderful job). Also, how am I supposed to believe a guy obviously in his 30's is playing a 24 year old?. As much as I find him handsome and a decent actor (I only seen him in 'The man from U.N.C.L.E'), he didn't live up to his role
Chalamet and his parents are other story. You can see and almost feel what Elio is going through, and for the year it's supposed to be (80's) his parent are quite open minded.
Now the ending, spoilers start here...Oliver call the family after gone for months for Hanuka, only to give Elio the wonderful news he's engaged, but, oh yeah, he 'remembers everything'...how lovely...Then we get to see Elio crying in front of the fire while the credits role...Oliver fell as a selfish and cruel character in my opinion at this point. I'm not saying he should have stayed and get married ('they' are too young for that), but dissapearing and only calling in Hanuka to destroy Elio's heart only seems like a cruel move. It would have been better if he just stayed gone
Sad, I was actually expecting a good gay themed movie, but I didn't feel the chemistry between them that much. Hammer really doesn't fit in this role at all and ruins everything it could have made the movie amazing",3,21,62,15 February 2018
