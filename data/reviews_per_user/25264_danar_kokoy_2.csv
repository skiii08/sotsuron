Sucker Punch," It was exactly what i expected!!!
","when I read some of the reviews on the net I was a bit disappointed , But MAN they got it all wrong. If you like Special effects take a BIG step towards Awesomeness then you should definitely watch this movie !! don't listen to the critics because they always have a change of hearts, For example when the Shining from Jack Nickelson came out it was panned by critics what guess what !! 15 years later they say that it is a Cult Classic!! Or when Empire strike's back came out they said that it wasn't a good movie but 10 years later they say ITS THE BEST SW MOVIE !! So like i said don't listen to them watch the trailer and you will know what to expect. Because really you know that the story isn't that good but damn the rest is Awesome !!Thank u Mr. Snyder and i can't wait to see SUPERMAN!!",6,8,19,26 March 2011
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," If you think Transformers 2 was the worst well..... Guess again!
","Okay when I saw the trailer I thought this looks awesome damn! I even read some reviews stating that this is the best transformers movie so far.. Man what were they wrong ,damn! 1)first let me say the CGI is awesome all 6 point I gave to this movie is because of the CGI, 2)Acting: if it weren't for Shia this movie would suck so badly acting wise GOD I was irritated by the girl Carty, totally no emotions what so ever ! I thought MR Bay there are thousands actresses that are hotter and more talented than this girl so WHY!!! And they didn't even told why Sam dumped his last girlfriend where he was risking his life for 2 time .. Very stupid..4)And the military is even more stupid! There is a moment where the commander says guys are we going to do this or what and A afro-American guys who we don't know nothing about what so ever ! Randomly says yeah cap I'm in .. I really thought is this a parody of south park or family guy?Or at one moment the city is been taking over and you see everybody yelling and screaming outside and you then the scene is inside A building and you see these people doing they're daily work I was like WTF!! We are been slaved and all you do is ow well I need my payment to survive.. 5) The robots: why i earth can't they make each robot unique even after 2 movies they could not make the robot so unique that when you see them battle you could tell who is who and what they were doing.. And all good robots have unique colors but the bad ones were all gray and looking mad all the time at one point you see A predator.. Talking about originality..And how are these robots conceived or what so ever? Why does old prime look like A old man if robots can't age facially ? And A planet what is made of only metal can't be named A planet but A big ass spaceship 6) This movie is as much of A sequel to transformers 2 as that dark knight is to batman and robin. In the second movie they say that the decepticons were on earth thousands of years ago but in this movies it says only since the 60's ?? Wtf?? 7) It was 2half hours but it felt like 6 hours OMG ! I almost fell A sleep! This was my first time this has happened to me ! Even DBevolution did'nt do this to me! And MRBAY!!! Learn to cut your scene because going from A sci fi scene to A teenager scene was so bad and irritating!! All you do is recycle the humor and dialog!",6,2,6,28 August 2011
