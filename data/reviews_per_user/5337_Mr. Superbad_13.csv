Alien 3," the complete opposite of Aliens
","Which is a reason why this movie is hated so much. Even though Alien 3 is much closer to the intent of the original movie. Aliens turned Alien into a neat action/sci-fi flick with a bunch of simple characters and moronic catch-phrases, and Alien 3 takes it to the opposite extreme. It's a dark thriller, not an action flick.Unfortunately it suffers from some big drawbacks. The sound mix is awful. For Example when Ripley is whispering you can barely make out what she's saying, so you turn the sound up and that's when a large explosion goes off and blows out your speakers. The effects hold up rather poorly. Also, every time they build up a character they kill them 5 minutes later. Leaving you with a bunch of characters you don't really care about.There are some great moments in this movie, and the cinematography is great, but it could have been so much better. Fincher said it was only 25% of what he wanted, and it shows. Maybe if the studio hadn't screwed around with the script and the editing, trying to dumb down the movie, this could have been great. Unfortunatley it's not, and is just slightly above average.",Null,28,47,22 October 1999
Fight Club," Brilliant...
","This movie is not for everyone, but it's definitely a masterpiece. I can't wait for more from David Fincher. If anyone tells you this is promoting fascism, or violence, they have completely missed the point. If showing an army of dimwitted drones being self-destructive counts as promoting fascism, I don't know how you could discourage it. The violence is portrayed in such a brutal way that you practically feel every blow. Every time someone gets their head pounded into the pavement you feel it. This movie is painful to watch, but well worth it.If you wait to see this on video, you will deeply regret it. I haven't seen a movie put together with so much care in a long time, if ever. Instant classic.",10,0,1,15 October 1999
Full Metal Jacket," Not enough kind words...
","The first half is great, and the second half... just as great. It changes tone halfway through the movie and that's what I love about it. It's like two movies in one. The first half about the brutality of training, and the second half about the absurdity of the vietnam war. All shot without the need or use of jungle warfare scenes. It also has some of the most memorable dialogue ever written. A classic.",10,0,0,10 October 1999
Being John Malkovich," ...
","What can I say? An original, weird, and funny comedy. All the characters that seem to be innocent and nice turn out to be evil and self-serving. All of them. The only good people in this movie are Charlie Sheen and Malkovich himself. That's probably the best thing about the movie.  I would have liked to see the chimp go inside the portal, but that's the only thing I would have changed. Brilliant. If you haven't seen it, go see it.",Null,0,0,30 May 2000
Dark City," It's just so... so... boring...
","There is just so much wrong with this movie that I don't see how people can like it so much. First there is the constant chase music playing in the background. It just doesn't let up. It's even in the boring dialogue scenes where it just doesn't belong. Some character could be asking to pass the mustard and there would be chase music playing. Why did they do this? It doesn't make the movie any more exciting, just annoying.The movie looks neat, and there are some good chase sequences, but that's about all it adds up to. If you find 'dude... what if.. like... my reality... may not be actual REALITY!!!' plotlines deep and meaningful, then you should find this movie deep and meaningful. I don't, and was just bored thoroughly during almost all of the movie.",4,7,14,24 October 1999
Aliens," Not as great as I was lead to believe...
","The whole first hour could have been cut down to about 15 minutes and not have lost anything. Why? Because nothing happens. Nothing. We get the plot set up and are introduced to a bunch of 2 dimensional macho marines, and that's it. It didn't need to take an hour to present this. It didn't establish a mood, all it did was make me wonder why they are wasting my time like this. I also thought the introduction of Newt was a pretty lame attempt to get me to care about the story. I'm glad she died in the third movie after seeing this. 'They mostly come out at night... mostly...' What a joke.Now, after about the hour and a half mark things actually start to get interesting, and from there on out it's a pretty cool movie. Even though the whole ending battle was forced and shouldn't have happened at all if Ripley didn't take pot-shots at the queens eggs (even thought they would have died anyway), It was still a pretty good ending.BTW, I saw the 168 minute directors cut, which may be why I think it drags for so long at the beginning.",6,1,6,8 January 2000
The Game," Amazing film that will leave some people cold.
","I love this movie, and have seen it several times. The first time you see the movie through Van Orton's eyes. The next time you watch the film you see it from CRS's view. This, to me, makes it great. Upon repeated viewing's I realized just how clever this film is. It seems, though, that some people who watch this just won't pick up on a few things, and be left in the dark.For instance, even though you might not react the same way that Van Orton acts, it doesn't matter because The Game is designed around him. They studied him for a whole day with comprehensive psychological exams, and probably learned a whole lot more from his brother. That way they know what he will most likely do, and have several safety nets in place if he doesn't. Magicians and Mentalists use these kind of techniques all the time in their shows.If you focus too much on what you would do during the movie, it might effect your enjoyment of it, and might make you miss the whole point of the movie altogether. This movie is amazing.****SPOILER WARNING****The only problem I had with this is the end. No, it's not that I wanted him to die. In fact I think it would have ruined the movie if he had died. To think that CRS could manipulate him so completely up to that point and then... whoops he's dead.. would have been a cop-out. No, the only problem I had was that if he had strayed to a few feet to the left when he went through the glass he would have hit a cross beam. The movie could have turned into a black comedy very easily. That's my one and only complaint.******END SPOILER******",9,0,0,19 October 1999
Total Recall," Is it real, or is it memorex?
","Eye-ball popping, ultra-violence, mutants, a giant homing device being pulled out through the nose, an exploding head, a three breasted hooker, a midget hooker firing a machinegun, some great one-liners, more eyeball popping, a great plot, and in the end it's up to you to decide if what you saw was real, or fantasy. What a great movie!",9,0,1,21 December 1999
Signs," A pretentious Outer Limits episode
","It had good acting, some genuinely scary moments, and some funny moments, but overall it just ends up being a well-polished turd. It also features the dumbest aliens to ever master interstellar travel depicted on screen. 'Hmm, we are allergic to water, so lets invade a planet covered by the substance, in dew-covered fields, and kidnap people who are made primarily of the stuff! Yeah, and lets not wear any protective gear at all! Brilliant plan! Oh no, they turned on the sprinklers! Retreat, retreat!' But since that apparently wasn't the real focus of the story (they only devoted about 90% of the movie building up that aspect, after all) The real story is about how a reverend deals with the invasion and gets his superficial faith back because of all the stupid coincidences helped him save his family, or something. It's not that the aliens border on being retarded, it must have been a higher power, yeah, that's the ticket.",4,1,1,8 August 2002
The Matrix," Slick, good action, but the story is pretty lame.
","The action sequences are great, and the overall movie is entertaining, but the plot is lame. It's entertaining enough for me to not care about the plot holes, or the uneven performances, however. Imaginative, but flawed.",7,0,0,10 October 1999
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Wonderful!
","If you like melodramatic tripe. I saw this years ago, and thought it was so-so. Saw it again last night and it blew me away at how awful the whole movie is. So while I was watching it, i was trying to figure out just what makes this so awful. Is it the actors? Well.. no.. brad pit can act, just watch seven, fight club, 12 monkeys, or true romance... and he's the center of the movie. Is it the director? Well.. no.. there are plenty of well shot and memorable scenes. I believe it all comes down to the source material. The dialogue is so cheesy, often to the point of being downright idiotic, that there is no way you can present it with out being completely awful. I'm sorry, but it's Anne Rice's fault. I believe a more appropriate title for this movie would be 'Brad Pitt's Flowing Locks', since that's what it seems to be centered on. This movie went through me like a pane of glass, to paraphrase a line from the movie. Truly awful.",4,1,8,16 June 2000
Windtalkers," Unfairly maligned
","First of all, most of the armchair historians who criticize this movie based on historical inaccuracies don't know what they are talking about.Yes, some Japanese did carry katanas and used them on the battlefield. Yes, the US troops did use flamethrowers as depicted in the movie. Yes, there were racists back in the 40's. Yes, contrary to what the military would like to portray, the code-talkers who were guarded thought it was understood that they were to be killed rather than captured (And this is perfectly understandable considering what the Japanese did to POW's, so I don't know why they are protesting it). Yes, the Japanese did insane  charges that left them with enormous casualties. Yes, in the real battle the number of Japanese to American casualties was heavily lopsided in favor of the Americans because of said tactics. And yes, contrary to what some have said, there are plenty of American casualties depicted in the movie. How some reviewers missed them, I don't know. Is the movie 100% accurate? No. Neither is any war movie ever made. The explosions were a bit too much, Joe has a few too many bullets in each clip, and there should have been more air support, but so what? If that sort of thing bothers you enough to take you out of a movie, find a hobby. This movie had good acting and characters I actually cared about, and actually did have character development and a plot. Obviously it didn't work for some people, but it hit the right chords with me.Is it perfect? Not really. It's pretty damn good, though, and so far it has been the best movie I've seen this year. I thought it was so good that I keep checking in to see how people are responding to it two months after seeing it. It's just unfortunate that people have been burned out on too many recent and well-done war movies to give this one a chance. Hopefully, people will discover how good this movie is on video.",8,0,0,8 August 2002
Gladiator," amazing
","Let me say that I saw this in an old theater with natural reverb, that was freezing the whole time. I've noticed Ridley Scott movies have a slightly muddy soundtrack. It's hard to describe, but it's noticeably when you view them. The natural reverb of the theater made it difficult to understand some of the movie, but I still found myself enjoying this movie.
Fuzzy, muddy, indistinct? I don't think so. Practically every scene in this film is beautifully shot, and looks like it could be turned into a painting. From the contrast of fire against the dark woods in the beginning, to the fights in the Coliseum , this film looks amazing. The cgi people weren't going for stark realism, but a very stylized look and I believe it works. If you look at the Coliseum the first row of people is real, and the second is cgi, and for the life of me I couldn't tell the difference. Since everyone seems intent on comparing this to Braveheart, I'll do the same. To put it simply, it makes Braveheart's cinematography look amateurish by comparison.
On top of the amazing cinematography, you have a completely immersive score. I never found it cheesy or manipulative, and I HATE manipulative scores (for example: Braveheart). What can I say about the story? It's a simple revenge story, but that really doesn't matter because the execution is so masterful. It's about death and redemption. My only complaint is that it seemed like some of the plot was cut out to make this more of a summer movie. I'm sure the dvd will fix the situation, though. Is this completely historically accurate? Of course not, and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a fictional tale, told in a historical setting. Demanding 100% historical accuracy from a movie that doesn't claim to be historically accurate is absurd and unfair.Overall, though, I don't really care what other people think about this movie. To me it is a work of art.",8,0,0,22 May 2000
