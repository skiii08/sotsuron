Vertigo," Storytelling issues prevent this from being a truly good film
","This film has two major flaws, both story-related.The first issue is that right in the beginning of the film, and then later again, it smears on you a sudden thick layer of awkward exposition, like a cheap Japanese anime. This should not be in a professional piece of work like this.The second issue is that, as with all Hitchcock's movies I have seen so far, the story relies on one of the characters to be an idiot in order to work. The premise is that a detective affected by vertigo is asked by his old pal to solve a mystery around his wife's strange behavior and as you watch the events play out it becomes apparent fairly quickly that the main character is being played. It is obvious, and it should be particularly obvious to a detective, but the movie pretends like it is not.And so, as I kept watching the film I suddenly caught myself mentally hurrying it up. Yes, I get it, the main character is obsessed and is being played. Come on, get to it already, get to the reveal. As the movie was drawing out the inevitable, the famous Hitchcock's tension was starting to wear out its welcome, as the dialogue and the music were getting increasingly teary-eyed.And then, at around the 1:40 mark the story takes a nose dive. Instead of revealing the truth at the end of the film, it spills the beans right then by means of a second awkward exposition where the main twist if the film is simply shown to the audience in a flashback and then explained through the thoughts of one of the characters. Look, movie, I know I was mentally hurrying you up, but I did not mean for you to prematurely unload in the most unsatisfactory manner. What a letdown! The very ending is a bit problematic as well. It feels like the writer did not know for sure what to do with the two main characters after all the cards were on the table. The way the story is completed feels odd and somewhat rushed.It is a real shame because the performances are good. The main character played by James Stewart has a charm about him. The famous Hitchcock's tension is there. There are some special effects used including animation, which looked cool. Even the story at face value is quite interesting, but unfortunately it is also noticeably flawed.",6,3,5,22 July 2015
The Sound of Music," A surprisingly deep and thorough creation
","If you haven't watched this film yet, you may have seen the scene of a woman running through the fields. You may know it's a musical. But did you know Sound of Music is partly about Austrian nationalism against Nazis? How about that it is based on a real family? This movie is quite an interesting ride. Besides the quality of cinematography and acting, there are two things that set this musical apart from other films: one is, of course, its iconic catchy songs and the other is its surprising depth.As for the songs, you may find yourself humming just moments after they are finished, before the movie is even over. They do not overpower your brain but there are definitely some musical hooks involved in the melodies. The songs are quite different from one another, in style and rhythm. Perhaps one weakness is that all the songs are happy songs and the movie struggles adapting its happy music to the more serious moments in the film.The movie does this trick where the characters sing the same song twice (at least) but the second time they sing it in a different situation, modifying the meaning of the song or adding more meaning. While the effect of this is quite good, the change is only a minor one in the meaning and not the mood, because most of the songs are too happy to make any change to the mood made. And even to change the meaning, the creators end up needing to modify the song. Only one song, Edelweiss, ends up sounding completely different when played the second time and without any modification to it.As for the depth of the film, it is felt in a number of spots: in the slowly emerging nationalistic sub-story, in the psychological situation of the main male character, in the subtle humour and children's commentary.If you have only seen little bits of this movie and its title you can be forgiven for thinking that it is just a sappy love story in a form of a musical, and for the first half of the film it is kind of heading that way, but it turns out to be much more than that.I don't like musicals, but even I cannot deny the greatness and quality of the Sound of Music.",8,2,9,20 December 2014
Skyfall," Almost great
","Skyfall is one of the better action movies out there.I suppose I could end my review there, but that would not be enough of a reason for me to be here. I would like to issue an open complaint in a form of a question: why do even good action movies insist on introducing a few lines of stupid dialogue and preposterous plot points? Surely someone has to read the script once it is done and approve it, and then approve the movie itself once that is done. What is the problem of the man or woman producer who watches how when something occurs in the movie one of the character has an annoying tendency to describe the event out-loud and the producer, upon seeing this, does not go: 'no wait, that has to come out coz that just sounds f&*$ing retarted. It looks fake and stretched.'? Somehow, no memory of such action-movie annoyances rises when recalling the good old James Bond featuring Roger Moore, so when did it start creeping in? Skyfall does not have too many of such moments but enough to be distracting.It is good to see an action movie not involve the story of a nuclear bomb threat, but Skyfall's story is not exactly original either. We have yet another vengeful operative wreaking havoc upon the agency and Mr. Bond is up against both the villain and father time, both of whom have been moving on leaving Mr. Bond behind at a disadvantage.The whole thing moves like a James Bond flick and makes sense as a whole, but if you did try to actually think Skyfall through scene by scene, the flow looks a bit bumpy and common sense questions can be raised quickly - obviously something that must never be done when watching an action movie.There is not much to say of the acting, other than that Javier Bardem was brought on board as the villain and Javier to Skyfall is what Anthony Hopkins was to the Silence Of The Lambs, i.e. a good villain like that makes half the movie.The action scenes are greatly choreographed and filmed, having a modern touch without relying too much on computer effects.",7,1,6,7 December 2012
Casablanca," Good. That is all.
","Casablanca is a difficult movie to review because there is nothing particularly wrong with it, but also nothing particularly excellent. It is more about whether or not you like its style.Its style is very misty-eyed. The insisting violin vibrato in the high register tries to cut into your heart, as the main hero talks harshly to the damsel, but inside we all know that in actuality he really loves her. This film can be impersonated by a lady who sighs as she holds her wrist against her forehead in a gesture of fainting.Is it cheesy though? Well, no, it does not go that far. It stays tasteful and professional, but its style is very clearly defined and may not appeal to all.The undertones of the story are about a refugee crisis and anti-Nazi resistance, but the movie is really about the relationship and conversations between the main characters, and to its credit those interactions are good.Humfrey Boghart is not my favorite actor. He is the poster child of the over-stylised acting that was so persistent in the first part of the 20th century, but this is probably one of his best roles. The most interesting is probably Claude Rains who plays an opportunistic French officer.It is competently made but there is nothing that strikes as particularly special about this film. There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching a good quality film, but all the hype that goes as far as perceiving this film as the best ever made is really unnecessary.",8,1,3,13 December 2014
In Bruges," Sure is an interesting production, but not a comedy
","I was interested because the description in one or another source stated this was a comedy and with Collin Farrel I saw that having food potential. In Bruges turned out to be an interesting production indeed, but it sure did not turn out to be a comedy. A layer of occasional irony only overlays the localized slow paced grunge of troubled minds stuck in the cold grey Bruges and their relationship.The film successfully manages to turn an otherwise slow and uneventful setting into an interesting and, in today's Hollywood infected world, a refreshing play, basing itself largely on the interaction between the few players who star in it, more than on the story or anything else. It's little gloomy quirks and twists make it a memorable movie, still mentioned in the office years after its release, but don't expect a 'hitman' movie going into it, as it is nothing like it.",7,0,5,28 April 2012
Chinatown," Very smooth, well made film
","It is not that Chinatown is really excelling at something, but more that it doesn't have any big flaws.Chinatown is a 'film noir' from the 70s about an early 20th century private investigator working a case. Played by Jack Nicholson, this fellow has a passion for finding out the truth regardless of the circumstances and he gets a bit too involved in a case.The film has a really good flow, almost too perfect, with a slowly growing tension until the end. Nothing feels awkward or out of place.The two main actors, Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway, are high caliber actors who do exactly what the film requires them to, but also none of the other actors mess up their roles. Even a kid who shows up in the movie for about 20 seconds is good at what he does.The music has a jazzy feel to it, but is filled with instrument effects that are integrated very effectively with the events in the film.There is nothing wrong with the camera work either. Good shot composition. Nothing brilliant or innovative though.But, if I had to nitpick, there are some issues with the story and its characters. The bad guy is not well outlined. His motivations and logic remain a bit obscure by the end of the movie.The plot overall is not always unclear. The general lines are clear enough but some details may escape you. This is a problem with detective stories in general, when the story goes down one path then down another and introduces minor characters that disappear only to reappear half a movie later and you are left with questions like 'Wait, so who killed that other girl and did she know that other guy?'.Also, for such a steady rise in the storyline, it ends very abruptly with a few of the issues still unresolved, though the abrupt end does fit the story of Jack Nicholson's character.Overall, this is a very clean and well put together film, but at the end of it I did not cheer or cry or change my mind about something. Chinatown excels only at being a very solid film.",8,0,1,29 November 2014
Lone Survivor," A realistic high quality action flick with a lack of depth
","Holy sh*t......You get so many action movies nowadays following familiar formulas that when you watch one of them you know that just when the good guy is about to get overcome by the enemy, the backup arrives and helps him. The formula desensitizes you.But when a movie is based on a real story, the good guys sometimes do not come. They do not come in an hour; they do not come in a day; and if they come, they are not invincible. Real problems do not follow formulas. Real life is sobering in its beauty and its horror.Lone Survivor does not have a very original or interesting premise for an action movie. A squad of US navy SEALs is dispatched on an assassination mission. Things do not go as planned.However, the quality of the cinematography, solid acting and good action is what makes this such a great film.Out of all the actors getting to play a part not one is bad. Not one fakes it. It feels that everyone is trying to do their best.The film is also gorgeous. It didn't have to be. It is. The Afghanistan these guys are in is fake because the entire movie was shot in the United States, but it looks authentic and breathtaking.The action is raw and graphic. Not in a guts-on-the-floor kind of way, but falling-down-a-cliff-side kind of way. Again, you can feel that the people have tried to do a good job. You know how just much they tried? Broken ribs and punctured lungs were involved in the making of this movie.If there is one problem I have with the film is that it has a self-imposing limit to how big or interesting it can be. It is a story about one military operation and nothing else. No background stories for the characters, no side events, and barely any relationship development. I remember as a kid I was really fascinated by the military ops and wrote a story, as good as I could, about an imaginary mission. Even as I was writing it, I realised that it can never be truly interesting to read because the range of the story is too small. And this film is like that. What's worse, the title of this film gives away the ending. It is basically a giant spoiler.But it is a testament to the movie's quality that, even though the movie gives almost no background information to the characters, it still managed to really make me care about them. Even with weights on its legs, the film still manages to make such an interesting run.",9,67,103,7 June 2014
The Big Lebowski," Has character
","Ehm...they did not finish the story.Were we not supposed to notice or were we not supposed to care? Towards the end Big Lebowski had about 5 or 6 story threads going, but left 2 of them untied at the end, one of which was a relatively major one. There is unexplained plot point or two. All in all, the story ends up being kind of disappointing.Then again, the story is not very important because this movie is all about the characters. The Dude and Walter Sobchak, the main characters played by Jeff Bridges and John Goodman respectively are awesome and memorable creations. Yes, Steve Buscemi is there too, but he doesn't do a lot. All of the characters in this film are eccentric. On the one hand, that is what gives this movie its colour, but on the other hand, this approach to character creation feels a step below simply having good believable people who are different from one another in a subtle but perceivable way. You and I, we too could come up with some crazy personalities that would as a result be memorable: we can create a guy who makes racist jokes every time he appears on screen and smokes a whole lot so we will make him have two or three cigarettes in his moth at all times. Making ridiculous characters is easy and lazy. And while the Dude and Walter ultimately do work as characters, some of the others in this movie do not.There are a few funny moments in this film, but there are equally few jokes that fail. The dialogue can be pretty good, pretty stupid and sometimes both at the same time.The film has a number of interesting looking scenes, mostly when the main character is knocked out or drugged. The music covers the visuals with a layer of rock, complementary to the Dude's and Walter's 60s persona. It is safe to say that the film goes for a specific style and nails it. It is only unfortunate that it is a bit more style than substance.Big Lebowski is like the weird friend in your party who is awkward and sometimes ruins things, but he has in time grown on you and you know that the party just wouldn't be the same without him. In that aspect he is very much like the main characters of this film.",7,2,3,21 December 2014
Fury," A solid war movie without much substance
","There is a part of the movie where the heroes come up against overwhelming odds and the leader decides to stay and tells his men to go but the men go, 'Nah, we stay with you' as the emotional music plays in the background. Checkbox checked.Besides this cliché and a few others about how bad war is, there is unfortunately not a whole lot to this movie. 'What is this movie about?' someone will ask. 'About a tank crew,' I would answer. 'What does that crew do?' 'They kill a bunch of Germans.' The sacrifice made by the main characters does not feel like it's for something. Many of the events and much of the dialogue feel forced, like the movie is looking for something of substance to add or make things seem more awesome than they are.The good part about this film is how well it is made overall. The camera work is solid. You can tell what's going on and there are plenty of epic shots. The music is epic too. It has that classic instruments foundation but it is layered with good atmospheric effects. The action feels weighty, despite the battles being fairly small scale. There is at least one really cool tank fight.The acting is good. Of course, with Brad Pit at the lead you pretty much guaranteed a solid performance but his support crew area all doing a good job as well. The Mexican character played by Michael Peña is funny but not so funny as to be overbearing. As with the rest of the movie, unfortunately there is nothing special about these guys. The naive noobie gunner at the center of the film is a walking stereotype of that type of character. The others are kind of blank. There is a scene that feels like it serves to give more background to the rest of the tank crew but it does not deliver a whole lot.Is it a very realistic war film? Well it has a scene or two that treat the enemy with a lot of respect and show the dirt of war, but the film can't help but revert to the super hero Americans theme we have grown sick of.Maybe in the end we need more movies that aren't about something. Meaningful epic movies have in themselves become a cliché. This film flows logically, looks good and doesn't overstay its welcome. If you are interested in World War II or in tanks then this is a must see.",7,2,5,19 June 2016
Fight Club," 'We just had a near-life experience'
","Edward Norton plays an emotionally troubled guy with insomnia, who is also the narrator of the film telling his own story. It is difficult to talk about the story because everything is so good that talking about anything feels like a spoiler. One thing for sure, the story is intelligent, entertaining and connects with the audience on both intellectual and animalistic levels. The believability of the plot does go down a little towards the end of the film, but who cares? The message of this movie is most interesting. It is not a new message but it is given a while new life in this movie. The first half of the film seems to show one point of view, a fairly popular point of view in the modern world, but it is later contradicted by the results of the main character's action.Even little bits in this movie can be brilliant, in fact, especially the little bits. You blink too long and you miss them, though the movie does a real good job at keeping your attention so you should not miss things too easily. Prepare to have your eyes glued to the screen in a semi-voluntary manner.The film looks amazing. It has a gritty and wonderfully disturbing look to it. There is a texture to everything. Even the people's clothes, it seems, were picked to invoke a specific feeling of texture.A lot of the film was shot at night in the city or in locations that are dimly lit and the film uses all those night lights to great atmospheric effect. So the movie, despite being gritty and textury, also ends up being really colorful. There are also some computer generated effects but they are used sparingly and to great effect, bending the viewer's mind.The dialogue is edible. If for nothing else, this what you come for. Every line is sharp and sober and hangs on to your brain with a steel hook. It really pays to see this movie somewhere where you can stop and rewind it because, like with its cinematography, the lines do not stay for long and you may miss something tasty.This is probably also Brad Pit's best role. The guy has never disappointed, but this looks like his masterpiece, like he is working his hardest and having the greatest fun doing it. Edward Norton has always had a docile delivery so he complements the insane Brad Pit very well.Perhaps my one problem is Helena Bonham Carter. It is not even her acting, which is quite good. It is the look. It is a mystery why that actress has to have the same appearance in every movie and in real life: The kooky Tim Burtonesque black-clad emo chick with wavy messy hairJust...paint the hair redor blueanything! The things is, it must be admitted that her look fits her role in this movie very well, so there is that.Also, it may be useful to point out, as the title of the movie very explicitly suggests, this movie is largely male oriented. Its bluntness, its grossness, its violence, most of its actors and even its themes are catered to guys.Fight Club is a movie for the history books. It is quite hardcore and definitely male oriented, which may limit its audience, but it is also brilliant in so many ways. Fight Club is quite possibly the most entertaining movie of all time.",9,0,2,14 December 2014
Citizen Kane," Interesting film, but perhaps a tad overrated
","Not bad. Not bad at all.But I cannot tell when this movie is failing and when it is just being purposefully stylistic and I am being an ignorant peasant. There is a number of times when a character makes a joke and others start laughing heartily...and it's not funny, and...I think it is meant to be not funny, but then again I am not sure. Other times the movie is quite funny with barely any effort.Actors overact, and it seems they are doing so on purpose, in the style of the that time. And yet other times the acting is quite modern and realistic.Then there is that fake looking old man's face mask that the main actor wears in the entire second half of the movie. If you think old man makeup looks bad in today's movies, try a 40s movie.And yet again, overall the visuals are quite good. The effects are interesting. It feels like the makers really tried to come up with new stuff. There are a lot of dissolves between shots and camera is flying through things. The film has a dream-like aesthetic.The plot is quite good, but is the movie teaching me lessons about life or is it being preachy and pretentious? Perhaps both? Overall, the movie is quite charming and well-acted. I just can't understand where its brilliance ends and its flaws begin.",7,0,1,17 November 2014
The Birth of a Nation," Good structure and epic feel, but too egotistical
","The Birth of a Nation is about the life and interaction between two families, one from the Confederate South and one from the Union North, before during and after the US Civil War. The story is quite strong. It has a clear structure and you get to know and perhaps even care about the main characters. It has its ups and downs, with a really intense action scene towards the end of the film. It is pretty good.However the largest problem is with the storyline. Look, it is nice that this movie stands for something, even if that something is resistance to abolitionism. Nowadays, politically castrated movies try to appeal to everyone and their messages are soft if and thin. You may disagree with the themes in the Birth of a Nation, but at least it has guts. Unfortunately, it has a bit too much guts, and its guts do not mix well with what this movie tries to be.The movie states in multiple title cards that it is presenting a historical account of events and indeed does so sometimes, even citing historical sources, but at the same time it leans so heavily to the pro-confederate and racist side that it undermines itself. Especially in the 2nd part of the film you can imagine the hatred seep from the person who wrote the screenplay. Did you know that during the reconstruction era in the South the inferior blacks just completely degraded the poor poor whites, depriving them of their rights. Gosh, now I know.If you want to make an exciting movie with clear heroes and villains, as is the case with this movie, stop inserting political commentary and claims to historical accuracy.The acting is quite good. There were a few surprising reactions (house burning down and one of the distraught residents suddenly smiles) but overall quite good. Of course, since it is a silent film, the acting has to be exaggerated to compensate for the lack of talking, but it can be surprisingly subtle in places.One of the controversial aspects of the film are all the actors in black-face makeup. It is however not the racist aspect of it that troubles this reviewer, but the distraction and confusion it causes as well as the unfortunate conclusions that could be drawn. It is simply distracting to see white actors play brown people, and because the movie is relatively dark and only has one colour, it can be hard sometimes to discern who is supposed to have dark skin until the movie tells you. This is especially true of the main mulatto villain who, at most, looks like he has a light tan. A few times the makers only bothered to paint the head of the white actor and left the rest of the body as is.The film does on occasion show black actors in the background, so why could the creator not find some more? Today, Hollywood apparently has no trouble finding Arabic characters to play terrorists in pro-Western action movies, where they get killed by their hundreds, so why did this movie have trouble finding black actors? There are three most obvious possibilities: the makers were too lazy to find more black talent, too racist to put black people even in minor roles, in which case they chose their pride over film quality, or too afraid that the audiences would not accept so many blacks in the movie. So which is it, laziness, arrogance or cowardice? None of the three makes a good artist.As this is a silent film, it uses title cards to clarify the events and it was pleasant to see that written dialogue was used very sparingly. Usually, in silent films, you get a shot of a person talking and then a title card states what the character is saying, but in this movie you mostly get a brief description of the scene that is about to follow and from then on you are on your own. So credit is due to the movie for being able to make the story so clear with just these short descriptions.Since this is a silent film, the music plays a big role. This film had its orchestral music custom made for it and it is some of the better neoclassical chamber music. Clearly, there are some existing melodies used this film, but they are woven together with original music to create one score that makes sense as a whole. The violins take a dramatic lead role and engrave themselves into your brain, remaining there even after the film is over.Birth of a Nation features good cinematography for the time. For one, the film is not purely black and white. It is monochrome, but the base color changes depending on the mood and location. Also, there are some interesting special effects used like burning cutouts of building shapes superimposed onto the film with running people, in order to imitate a burning town. It actually looks better than some of the modern CGI effects. The one things that this movie overuses is smoke. It covers up so much that you cannot tell what is going on, which is possible what the creator was going for in order to simulate chaos. Speaking of chaos, there are also some impressive large battles involving what must be at least a hundred people.In short, Birth of a Nation has a number of pretty good qualities. It has a clear story, good structure, good actors, some impressive large scale scenes and special effects. However, its cultural aspect causes its weaknesses, not because of the racist material, but because of how the movie handles itself.",7,0,0,1 December 2014
World War Z," Good action with strong performance but not much story
","You know what, I think the name might be the problem. What do you expect from 'World War Z'? What the hell are you supposed to expect? I asked my partner, 'Do you want to watch World War Z with me?' She went, 'Nooo,' because she was convinced this was a war movie. The truth is that this is a much better movie than its title. The plot is not particularly original. Brad Pitt + worldwide zombie epidemic. That's the plot. Oh yes, stuff happens alright, but very little of it is noteworthy. What this movie is really about is the spectacle. The action is well spread throughout the movie, and when it kicks in, it is intense. The camera work is nice and varied, from chaotic close-ups of wrestling zombies to those expensive overhead flying shots. There are a lot of different locations and faces and guns and chaos and zombies, oh my, are there a lot of zombies. You get a feeling this movie tries to be epic and it mostly succeeds.There are quite a few actors that make an appearance and all contribute a good performance. It's a shame the contributions are short. It is mostly Brad Pit carrying the film on his shoulders, and I suppose if you are paying a guy like him then of course you want to give him a lot of screen time, but it is a shame that none of the other people stick around for long enough to make us remember them. They show up out of nowhere and disappear into the background. There is a somewhat memorable Israili woman that serves as main character's partner while Brad's wife character is not around, but that is about it.The main problem is still the plot. I suppose it is hard to make a disaster or horror movie that does not have plot problems. It is not just that the outline is simplistic. The narrative in World War Z is a bumpy ride with convenient events and nonsensical science. It feels like the world, the laws of physics and the entire space–time continuum revolve around the superman Brad Pit as it suits his cause. On the bright side, the plot is not predictable. Quite a few things happen that I did not see coming.Despite the problems with the plot, it is still a great action spectacle though and definitely worth seeing.",7,1,2,17 April 2014
Argo," Good.
","Argo is a good movie, but it is a question whether or not Argo harbors anything special.This is a movie about a Canado-American mission to exfiltrate 6 US embassy workers during the Iranian hostage crisis of 1979. It is a somewhat original subject matter, but there has already been a direct-to-TV movie about it.The performances are good but none stand out, except perhaps for John Goodman who appears in the movie only for a short time. The dialogue is solid too and has a few humorous phrases, but not brilliant in any particular way.Cinematography is also good. The makers nail the late 70s aesthetic, like haircuts and glasses and cars.The camera work is solid and it seems designed to increase the feeling that the viewer is there, with a lot of close ups and slight shaking caused by camera being held in the hands a lot. Shots of things quickly passing by make you feel anxious like one of the hiding embassy workers. It successfully creates the tension, which is what this movie is all about.The same tension is unfortunately damaged for anyone who knows the history of the Iranian hostage crisis and therefore knows how the movie ends. There is a part of the movie when the whole operation is called off. Oh no! How will they ever?..Oh, right...It is like the movies invites viewers who are politically interested enough to watch a political thriller like this one but not interested enough to have checked the history of the event. It would be better if these story was completely fictional so that the tension could have remained undisturbed by reality.This is ironic because the movie takes a number of freedoms with the actual story, like giving most of the credit to the Americans for the mission, which actually makes the movie part fiction. Should have gone all the way...Having said that, it is a testament to this movie's quality that the movie still manages to make the story interesting and tense enough.The biggest surprise of this film is perhaps that such a good movie could be directed and acted by Ben Affleck, who had left a bad impression in some people's minds with some of his previous acting jobs, but this surprise alone does not merit a great movie.Argo is then a fairly tense, well paced and well directed film. That is all.",7,1,2,31 December 2014
Star Trek Into Darkness," Greatly overrated but good looking and the action is nice
","Ugh...The dialogue sucks. It has a ton of needless exposition and introduction. It is sometimes out of sync with what is going on, badly timed, odd, often nonsensical. Random example: there is a scene when Zulu is making a threat as part of the plan and his colleague Leonard says, 'Remind me never to p*ss you off'. That sentence is not applicable here because Zulu is executing a plan Leonard is partaking in. That sort of odd thing keeps breaking the immersion. I am surprised that so many people did not notice or did not have a problem with the wording in this movie.The screenplay has a few arguably useless scenes, but the situation improves as the movie picks up pace. Oh, it still very much has plot holes, but the film starts moving fast enough that you do not think about them too much. The best times are when the action kicks in. It is exciting and the new generation of computer effects look great, even when real items are placed against the computer generated ones, which in so many other movies makes the CGI look fake by contrast. Some of the more distracting scenes in the movie are that ones that involve fan-pondering because it is unnecessary and just does not work. A good movie reference is dropped discretely, perhaps as part of the background, and not as whole phrases or scenes taken from the old Star Trek movies. That just fits awkwardly. Though If you haven't seen the old Star Trek movies, this probably won't bother you.As for the actors, Chris Pine as main protagonist is rather generic. Yes, he expresses emotions when he is supposed to, but it doesn't feel like he has a distinct character, not even the one that the exposition of the movie keeps insisting he has. Simon Pegg makes for an excellent Scotty though. I'm glad he gets a lot of screen time here. Also, Benedict Cumberbatch does an excellent Hannibal Lector impression. If only the stuff he had to say was a little smarter then he could have totally pulled it off. To compensate for the less than great dialogue, he kicks ass physically. In fact, considering his coolness and considering his motivations, the movie does a bad job at making him appear evil. But I guess a good villain needs believable relatable motivations. As for the females, it feels like they are mostly there for mandatory eye candy. At least the film knows its audience. While the script is questionable, I do really like the art style and sound design of this film. The clean cool look of bright buildings and textured uniforms contrasts against the old stone and dark fiery destruction. Yes, there are too many lens flares, as many have pointed out, but it fits the style of the film and was not distracting to me.In short, Into Darkness is good looking, has great action but the drama in between the action is lacking quality. For the first time I really feel like IMDb should have a score available between 6 and 7.",7,0,2,3 May 2014
Ted," It's OK, but should have gone further away from 'standard'
","Ted's an odd movie, which is a good thing. Seth MacFarlane brings his style onto the big screen and it is a welcome refreshment. Unfortunately, it is not odd enough.It feels like the script of the movie was written by two people. The one who wrote the funny stuff is good, although the jokes do have a Family Guy feel about them so if you do not find that funny thenyou're wrong obviously. But then it is like there is a second guy who wrote the emotional part of the story and that guy is not as good. The really serious dialogue, that is mostly in the 2nd part of the film, can be terrible. Every now and then there was a line so cliché and bland that my brain could not believe that the makers were just going to leave it like that and I kept expecting a follow-up statement or a punchline of some sort from the character, but it never came. And it does not help that it is difficult to take anything seriously that involves a talking teddy bear.It was also weird to feel like a psychic, as the plot was becoming increasingly predictable. As a whole, I would not call the plot to be stereotypical, in fact the concept is quite fresh, but in many parts it was easy to guess what was going to happen next.That said, the actors do their job OK, Giovanni Ribisi especially awesome as the creepy villain; the movie is funny and for most part quite smart; and it has Mila Kunis in it.",7,0,0,14 February 2014
Oldboy," Well that was different...
","Oldboy is a really interesting and messed up movie. You may need to be a right kind of person (or perhaps a wrong kind of person) to watch it. It is not going to be for everyone's tastes, which is all the more surprising just how well it has been received.This film was really something else. Something I have not seen before.The scenes in this movie catch you off guard, with your mental pants down. You think you are about to see something but then it surprises you ahead of time with a close up of something else. Your mind is hopelessly out-gunned. And there you sit, with your mouth open wondering what the next scene may bring next or what other camera angle they will invent. Just remember to breath in between the scenes. And it is awesome.You may have seen graphic movies before, movies that pour gore and yelling all over you like a big electric saw. Oldboy is less like a saw and more like a scalpel or needle piercing the skin.Having said that, Oldboy tries a bit too hard. It becomes obvious that it tries to shock you with a new image or thought or sick twist.It goes a bit over the top in certain parts, sometimes breaking a mostly serious and realistic tone with a more extreme cartoony style, which is not surprising considering its manga roots.Towards the end of the film, when some key things get revealed, the explanation is a bit contrived, deus-ex-machina-ish if you will. You have to buy into the movie wholly to buy what the story sells.The music was very interesting and noticeable. There was a fight scene and you get a minimalistic track of a lonely trumpet and beats. And it totally works, making a scenes take on a wholly different tone than you would expect.If you can stomach its style, Oldboy is a movie that needs to be seen once in a lifetime. It was a mind-bending experience.",8,1,4,19 December 2014
L.A. Confidential," One of the most entertaining movies ever
","This movie got genuine laughs out of me a few times and it is not even a comedy.Essentially, LA Confidential is a movie belonging to 3 men and 1 woman: Kevin Spacey, Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe and Kim Basinger. Kim has been praised and nominated for her role, but frankly, she is the least interesting of the four, at least to this reviewer. Her role is one: tragic composure. Guy is the lead role, Russell is a force of nature and Kevin Spacey is charming and brilliant as usual. The latter is known for playing bad guys but he is even more adorable in good roles and is the number one reason for seeing this movie. His performance is so great I could eat it all right up.The music score, as in so many detective stories, is jazz tinted with the occasional lonely trumpet insisting this is a 40s detective film noir. That is a bit cliché but the movie does change it up and it is not overly insistent.The dialogue is a bit too good to the point of fake, like real movie dialogue. It can get quite fast and smart, which means it lacks the natural stupid that can be found in real conversations. And the spicy dialogue makes another problem more apparent: actors are hard to understand. There is a lot of mumbling, under the breath speaking or speaking with a cigarette in the mouth.The biggest issue though is probably with the story. Like many detective stories tend to do, it has too many turns, requiring more attention than the aforementioned mumbling speech will allow. And when you find out what the motive is.meh, an old story.Despite the issues with the story, this film flows so well and is so well acted that everything else is just dust in the wind. It shouldn't be as good as it is, but it is.",8,0,2,23 November 2014
Moana," Great looking and good characters and that's about it
","Some time has passed since my viewing of this movie and the first thing that comes to mind, when I think about it, is the scene in which Moana goes to the shoreline of the island where she lives and the first song plays. Watching this scene on a big TV in HD makes your jaw drop, as you are mesmerized by all the pretty colours. As with many recent Pixar animations, the creators go out of their way to make everything as colourful as possible, to the point that certain neon-lit magical creatures and scenes feel like they were created solely for the purpose of allowing creators the freedom of using extreme colours that you would not otherwise encounter in a realistic setting. This is not a complaint, at least not on its own. The net result is that the movie does look gorgeous. However, this observation takes the shape of a minor complaint when you take into account just how standard the other aspects of the movie are. At that point, the excessive visuals and style start looking more like a set of jingling keys, distracting the viewer from the fact that the rest of the movie is just ok.Moana has interesting characters, with Moana herself not being one of them. The demigod Maui's dominating arrogance is a refreshing trait for a main character, his animating tattoos are funny (although this again is more of a visual aspect rather than a character trait), his backstory is interesting and his arch is subtle. The giant crab is fun, even though he is not on screen for long. The acting and dialogue are good, though not groundbreaking.However, the plot is just a rehash of the same old story: a young character feels the drive to cross a boundary, set by his or her guardians. The young character then disobeys and gets in trouble, but ultimately overcomes, learning about self in the process and usually learning to be more responsible. There is an interesting little twist at the end, which puts Maui's character in an even more interesting light but that's about it.Moana has no major flaws and it's a pleasant watch from beginning to end, but I do contest the apparent tendency of some people to treat this movie as a God that needs to be worshiped.",7,3,4,2 March 2018
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A unique creation
","What I find awesome about this film is that it is first and foremost a pretty cool action and drama movie. I am going to look for more Kubrik's war movies because the scenes of the fighting between troops looked like camera footage from an actual war. The situation inside the warplanes is also shot seriously. Also, despite the occasional comedic situation, the characters are playing it relatively straight throughout most of the film and you can sense some real tension in what happens to them.This relatively serious approach makes humor all the more striking, like when the tune of 'The ants go marching' starts playing. Dr. Strangelove is not really a comedy in the standard understanding. There are no punchlines. The humor instead comes from the overall silliness of the situation and the 'jokes' are subtle. It is still a really interesting thing to see.The only thing is that the scenes showing the planes flying are surprisingly really bad. I know they can do better. I have seen Russians make war movies immediately after the war that had better looking flying planes. It's so bad in fact that I think it was done on purpose.Anyway, I really recommend this one. It holds the test of time quite well and its underlying messages are still relevant as they are more about people in general than about the nuclear scare of the cold war. It has good high level cast (of its time) and well done, Kubrick, RIP.",8,0,3,30 March 2014
Fast & Furious 6," A well shot, fun, ridiculous, dumb action movie
","So let me ask you a question. Say, a man had been doing dangerous criminal activities in the past. Having managed to survive and even earn some money, he now has a wife and a young child. An old acquaintance shows up and entices the man to go back to doing dangerous work. What would be the man's reaction and what would be his wife's reaction? If you answered something like, 'the man would decline and the wife would get furious and probably start yelling', then you are a sane human living in the real world. And if so, I cannot see how this movie would not irritate you, at least a little, unless you are able to entirely let go of reason for the sake of enjoying action. As for this reviewer, I am no longer able to let go of common sense as much as so many movies ask me to.This is film where a British policeman shoots a submachine gun from the open window of his car on a busy street; where families and good lives are being abandoned for the sake of a questionable plot; where pretty girls are running around with guns and driving fast cars; where everyone talks cool but dumb.The movie throws character development and story introduction right out of the window and makes whatever shortcuts it needs to make to get you to the speeding cars as soon as possible.Well, at least it's efficient at getting you what you are expecting from this movie. Because what Fast and Furious does well is action racing. There is a good variety of vehicles racing, getting smashed and doing the smashing. And all that action is really well shot. The cuts between the shots are fast but not erratic. The shots are made from interesting angles, often from the bystander's perspective. There are also quite a few fight scenes and those are well choreographed and well shot as well. In fact there are usually several fights scenes happening at the same time and you can tell who is punching whom, where and how. You see stunt people doing actual work.Having said that, even though the story only exists to get you from one action scene to the next and it is not very logical, you do understand what is going on. And as the movies progressed I found something strange was beginning to happen. It was getting continuously better and better and better. The plot mattered less and less and the situation at hand and the relationship between the characters mattered more and more, so that the stupid receded and the good had come to the foreground. The plot raised its ugly head a couple of times again towards the end though.The acting from the leads, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, and Michelle Rodriguez hold up this film. Diesel and Rodriguez still have chemistry. If anything, these people gotten better at doing the Fast and Furious stuff. Dwayne Johnson as the lawman is also really good. In fact, with Vin's and Paul's characters always being so serious and playing the same old puppy-eyed good guys, Dwayne's character brings much needed fun to the movie. And his appearance really fits the fast muscle cars.The character of the British villain played by Luke Evans does not have much flavor besides 'eeeevil', but having said that, he does his job at appearing to be really cold and calculating.The rest of the crew though are not as good, though neither are the things they are given to say. The side characters are really at their best when they shut up and fight. The dialogue is kind of dumb containing a lot of short shallow one-liners. Interestingly though, the better dialogue is saved for the team of the British villain. In fact I wish those guys got more screen time.In conclusion, a lot of REALLY dumb plot points but all together a fun action movie.P.S. Somewhere in Spain there is a military base that has a runway that goes the entire circumference of the Earth.",6,3,5,6 July 2014
Alien," Simply a great film
","There is so much great about Alien that it is hard to know where to start. Let us start with the title screen. Against the background of outer space the word Alien is very slowly formed, setting right from the start the tense pacing of the film.The film is about a crew of a spaceship dealing with a hostile alien encounter. The movie is actually built on a relatively cliché horror movie formula. However, it does that formula very well and layers some really interesting material on top of it, which makes this movie unique. For example like many other horror movies, it resorts to a lot of jump scares, which may be a cheap tactic, but the jump scares are done well. The movie also follows the formula of separating a group of people and killing them one by one, but the way this plays out and the reasons for the separations feel fairly sensible.Not everything in the storyline makes sense and it is not a perfectly smooth ride, but the blemishes are very insignificant.Furthermore, Alien is one of the most original looking films and its looks hold up well even today. The mock up models of the main space ship unfortunately look like plastic. The inside of the ship on the other hand looks awesome. The light off-white design of living quarters mixed with dark industrial corridors looks very nice. The old CRT computer screens and the mechanical keyboards do look outdated but, not only do they fit well with the overall design, the austere small screens with their static and few colors also add to the overall creepiness and claustrophobic mechanic feel of the environment. The alien designs were done by the wonderfully insane H. R. Giger. His designs are very unique and nightmarish but at the same time believable and natural looking. When you see an alien move inside an egg it looks very real. The alien mechanics and designs are sexualized. One of the writers for the movie claimed that the story symbolizes rape. I do not know just how consciously the male writers were integrating that subject matter into the film, but if you look at the design and at H.R. Geiger's work on which the alien design was based, there are very clearly human sexual organs involved. Sadly, the technological limitations mean that while the design of the creatures is cool, when those creatures move, it looks bad and in some cases unintentionally funny.And the sound design, oh the sound design is responsible for about 40% of the creepiness factor of this film. Chilly space-music with little to no rhythm is mixed with various sound effects that are not always caused by anything specific on screen but that nonetheless integrate themselves into the visuals very nicely.All the Little bits contribute to this movie's unforgettable atmosphere. There is a brief scene where the characters just quickly go over the composition of the alien planet before they go outside. Was the scene really necessary? No, but is a great way to establish atmosphere. The distorted shaky images of the helmet cams, the cramped conditions and the creepy sound effects combine to make a most intense film.The actor performances feel very real. It is believable right from the start that the crew members are people who have been working together before. In fact, I read that the director actually made the actors spend time together so that when filming started they would be well acquainted. However, a minor complaint is appropriate about the lack of shock or surprise in the crew members when some of the messed up events take place. Sigourney Weaver plays the part of the intelligent strong woman officer who tries to stay calm and stay in control of the situation. She was an important ingredient in this film. She made it into every subsequent Alien movie and for a good reason. My favorite actor besides Sigourney is Yaphet Kotto as one of the mechanics. He feels the most natural, like an actual worker of the ship.This film is not perfection. Not all of the scenes may be strictly necessary and not everything looks timeless and not all dialogue has a purpose and the performances are not Oscar worthy, but taken as a whole, Alien is such an interesting and effective film that it can be rightfully called one of the best movies of all time.",9,1,3,28 December 2014
Suicide Squad," A mess but not as bad as people make it out to be
","This movie is a mess. It had a troubled production. Scenes have been cut and re-cut and then re-cut again. The story structure is not great and the exposition is nauseatingly blunt. The movie just writes parts of the story on the screen and then characters occasionally just explain what's happening or who someone is.And it is insultingly dumb, in every meaning of this word. I do not even know where best to begin. The movie is about a gang of people, most of whom don't have superpowers, fighting an incredible magic evil, but the movie also establishes that superman exists, so that makes no sense. The movie shows a bunch of pillars get destroyed in a subway but in one of the following scenes the same columns are only damaged. People will constantly blurt out unnecessary exposition or explanations, as if this movie was for mentally disabled. A screen in a government control room at one point shows the destruction of satellites and remote facilities from perfect angles, as if there are cameramen at each location filming at just the right moment.However, the actors all do a good job, including the ones you wouldn't think were good actors. The strange look of the new Joker doesn't work for The Joker, just like everyone thought it wouldn't, but it does fit this specific character in this specific movie. The story, although simple and poorly put together, does make some basic sense. The movie looks cool.It is essentially a dumb super-hero movie with style. It is harmless enough to run at an evening party.",6,0,0,8 January 2017
Battleship Potemkin," An epic but overrated propaganda
","When you read that Battleship Potemkin is a propaganda movie, please be aware that this does not mean that the movie just has a revolutionary tone to it or a message, like Birth of a Nation. No, it really literally is a propaganda film where one side is getting viciously vilified, the other side is wholly righteous and victimized and there is a very clear motivational message told to the viewer.This is different from a normal heroic movie where there is a clear villain and a clear protagonist. Such exaggeration of characters in a normal film is for the viewer's benefit because the viewer gets more enthralled in the characters actions and more entertained when they succeed. In propaganda films it is not for the viewer's benefit and you can feel that! Propaganda films feel preachy and pushy as their purpose is not entertainment, even though they may be entertaining in the process. Such films therefore have a disgusting core, and unfortunately, for all its epic feel, Battleship Potemkin is no different.Besides that, when this film tries to convince the viewer it on occasion misses its mark or is hilariously corny. A grown man gets slapped on the back a couple of times in his sleep and that gets him crying. It just feels awkward, like the movie is trying to look for trouble everywhere, clutching at straws.Other times it just does not explain things well. There is a scene where the men look at an officer with contempt but does not give a reason for it, until later I realised that it was because the sailors were refusing to eat.Visually Battleship Potemkin is very impressive. It is very good at conveying its propaganda with simple to understand messages and symbolism. It is also good at creating tension, surprise, atmosphere and just showing off some pretty maritime scenery. There are a few interesting special effects and cool camera movements during the famous stairway sequence.However, as already mentioned, the events are not always shown clearly and it goes overboard with the its propaganda scenery to the extreme. There are other oddities too, like a gun clearly not pointing at a person and yet the person falls to the ground anyway after the gun is fired. There are also a number of scenes that drag on for a too long with nothing important happening, and that in a movie that is only about an hour long. If you cut out all the unnecessary bits the movie would probably not be more than 30 minutes. It only has 3 events to show (though the film divides them into 5 parts).The best thing about this film was the music. It was not just providing the mood but also the sound effects for what was happening on screen, which was not a standard thing for silent movies at the time, and the music managed to do so without losing its flow and without stopping being music, so that if you remove the movie, the orchestral music is still really interesting. It has a bombastic modern feel to it of a Hans Zimmer composition but a timeless sensibility of the classical music.Now, to take that support away a little, if you see the modern version of the movie you will likely get the remastered version of the soundtrack, and no doubt the original quality would have been lower.The most pleasant thing about this film is its presentation, consisting of an epic and lively soundtrack and visuals. But its story is presented awkwardly, with the political pushing being uncomfortably obvious and other awkwardness in the scenes. This film has plenty of sins.",6,0,0,13 December 2014
Taxi Driver," This movie has one of the longest run ups of any story.
","The problem is one of two things: either the first half of the film is meant as a setup for the 2nd half, in which case that is way too long, or the first half of the film is actually meant to be an active participant, in which case it fails. it has a cohesive structure. It has events. It has characters. It has music. But what is the point? Oftentimes it seems there isn't one and it takes a long time for something meaty to arrive. And even the movie's ending is not a full stop.The film consists of a series of events in the life of a cab driver. Unfortunately, a lot of them are not interesting, even though on paper they should be. Scenes with little content last a good long while and then end in some awkward situation because the main character is mentally and socially unstable. Those scenes are reminiscent of movies like the Midnight Cowboy, an Oscar-awarded movie I would rather go to a dentist than watch.The film shows the various dirt you see in a city at night, but you can probably see it better yourself if you hang around the streets or watch a documentary. There are a few situations that are interesting, but every time they are followed up by a long nothing. If the long pauses are meant to create tension or accentuate the descent into madness, they fail, creating awkwardness instead. It would appear that the director asks the viewer to do the work and fill in a lot of the blanks instead of doing the effort himself and putting in the sufficient energy.As Taxi Driver enters its 2nd half, the cerebral content and the tension start seeping in and it gets more and more interesting, but you have to wait almost an hour to arrive at this point. It takes TWO THIRDS of the movie before Jodie Foster's character shows up. The pay-off in the 2nd half of the film feels worth it and the movie makes sense in the end, but it requires a ton of patience from the viewer. It is like a good joke that takes an hour to get to the punch line.The acting is good as you would expect from Robbert De Niro, but it is also appropriate for the role, which means it is subdued and realistic to the point of boredom. Again, as with the story, there are good moments, most of them in the second half. The camera-work is simple but also brilliant in its simplicity. When the camera movies, there is a real sense of purpose and weight.The ending is an interesting choice. Without spoiling too much, the problem is that mental sickness doesn't just end with a happy ending, so it is strange to see a rather positive open ending.Bottom line, this is not a movie for me, but the quality is there if you have the patience.",6,1,5,17 August 2015
The Godfather: Part II," Getting a bit overly dramatic, but still really good
","The problem with Godfather II is that it goes a bit too far for the sake of false drama. It is like a kid who gets hit by a parent, cries and as he is crying he keeps thinking about how sad his life is and how everyone would feel sorry once he is dead, and the kid keeps getting a kick out of this self-made drama.Without spoiling much, the main protagonist, crime boss Michael Corleone, eventually starts making moves that feel unnecessary, unless you view them as a means by the writers of the story to create more crime drama.The story of Godfather II has some weak and some strong points. If you retrace the steps of the storyline after you finish watching the film, they are not necessarily illogical but they do sit kind of loose in the plot. These plot points feel more like vehicles for specific dramatic scenes than a natural story. On the other hand, the story does provide some great historical perspective on the history of the mafia and also general commentary on certain social aspects of life.Everything else about this film was pretty good. It is understandable how this film reached its position as one of the top films of the last century.The acting is top notch. In fact, it is what serves as the main course and the desert. You do not go to Godfather movies for action; you go to them for the interaction between all these great actors. These shots are up close and personal, with strong dramatic shadows on characters' faces. The experience is sort of like eating a good steak, no salt or pepper needed.",8,2,4,15 November 2014
Fargo," Warm & Cold
","Fargo is a good movie with a specific style but it will undoubtedly leave a few viewers disappointed. There are principally 3 faults with the movie, all 3 of which are story related:1. Fargo opens with the following text: ' THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.'This is a lie. Definitely in the way this sentence comes over, this is a lie. It becomes evident as you watch the events unfold that they are not a realistic retelling of any specific crime story. The text comes right at the beginning and, as such, sticks in your memory. The directors knowingly put this into the movie and it feels insulting.2. Unresolved plot lines. The main plot is that a guy is conducting several different kinds of illicit activities because he desperately and urgently needs a lot of money. It is never explained why. Sorry, but letting the viewer out of the most important question in the story is both cruel and unprofessional. There is also another more minor point that never gets resolved though the resolution is hinted at.3. The general lack of impact. Despite some fairly violent events occurring, this movie feels very low key and rather slow. It is part of its style and seems to have purpose, but you must be aware that this movie takes its time and for some that time may not amount to that much in the end, especially considering points 1 and 2. When the film ended, it felt more like I just saw an episode of a show rather than an entire movie.Despite these flaws, the story is interesting. It was fun to see the continuously worsening situation of the criminals and the calm and appealing investigation by the protagonist.The movie has a particular style in both the visual presentation and story. The events take place in the winter in the north of the US and the outside is a world of desaturated cold white. It is starkly contrasted by the warm cozy lives of the common people inside the warm houses, with the warm food and the warm friendly feelings. This is also contrasted with the cold dealings of the criminals and their world of misery.At first it feels at first like the world of those criminals is full of intrigue while the life of the main protagonist Marge is mundane and small, but as the movie progresses, the proceedings of the criminals become full of misery and very petty in comparison with the apparently small lives of others. Fargo feels at times warm and cuddly, other times cold and disturbing.Fargo has a unique soundtrack. It is built on a slow tune of strings, a lot of it in medium to lower register, with slow and deep base drum beats in the background and some high pitch percussion. It has a folksy and meditative feel to it. When some sort of action happens, the music either goes quiet or continues with a grave tension but never becomes fast. It sounds quite different from your average movie soundtrack.The performances are great, all of them. William H. Macy plays the desperate car salesman and this guy makes his character looks so skittish, with his nervous smile and the shaking head and the stuttering. He does a near flawless job. Frances McDormand, as the protagonist policewoman received the many nominations for her performance. She has previously played a mom and the role of a homely family woman suits her well and she does indeed deliver a very pleasant humorous performance. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are the criminals, as is often the case and they are fun too. Peter is a guy who is just naturally extremely unnerving. In this movie he does not talk much or move his facial features. His lifeless expression and composure are just naturally terrifying and the scary impression he gives gets completely justified when he suddenly does something really violent.There is a small complaint about the dialogue. While it is generally entertaining , there seems to be a strange mockery going on as the characters keep saying 'ya' a lot, which is 'yeah' spoken in the northern accent. I cannot figure out if this is supposed to be joke or just poking fun at the Northerners, but it does get annoying after a while.Fargo feels different than your average film. It is a bit slow but it is a sweet coherent and interesting movie. This movie makes you feel warm inside, despite its violent content.",8,1,2,26 December 2014
Léon: The Professional," Weak dialogue sometimes,an awesome film otherwise
","Let us talk about the elephant in the room: the 13 year-old Natalie Portman as Mathilda...with that choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. I suppose it was OK for me to drool over her because I myself was about the same age as her when the movie first came out and yes, my eyes were eating the screen when she was on it. The creators knew very well what they were doing with the subject matter because they emphasize that stuff and make it part of the plot, especially in the extended addition of the movie. In the end they do keep it clean. In fact, while parts of the movie go to lengths in order to sexualize the situation, the other parts go equally far in order to keep the material palatable. For example, the main premise of the story is that Mathilda ends up living with and developing an affection for Leon the hit-man, played by Jean Reno. However, Leon's character is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life, which evens out the psychological levels of these two characters and makes the relationship more innocent and acceptable. Luc Besson's obsession is with showing distressed but strong hot women with guns that get thrown into the men's world. This creates a contrast like when a woman poses on a bike contrasting tender flesh against masculine machine. And Leon is perhaps the best of Luc's female experiments. In the movie 'La Femme Nikita' it was a woman but she was at least a grown woman. In a movie like 'Lucy' the character quickly becomes completely overpowered and the vulnerability factor is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters - you cannot get any more of a contrast than that. Sadly some of the effect is lost due to the way Mathilda ends up being portrayed. This character as well as her relation to the world around her are interesting. Her interactions and chemistry with Leon are also interesting. The performance put Natalie Portman into the spotlight as an actress, but her dialogue is not great.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the dialogue. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic cheesy action-movie dialogue, pointing out the obvious and not giving the viewer anything deep to think about. It sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy, perhaps for a comic book. Matilda's character suffers most of all because she sounds nothing like a kid of her age would sound (which I suppose is a problem more movies suffer from). Just take the title of the film, which is a typical example of this movie's writing. There is nothing wrong with just 'Leon', since that is a main character's name. But the full title of the film is 'Leon: the Professional'. 'The professional' is just such a cheesy thing to put in the title, like something from a teenager's comic book or an 80s B action movie. The acting is great though. My favorite and never disappointing is Gary Oldman as the main baddie. It feels like this guy puts all of himself behind this performance. There are scenes in this film that make you wonder how close he came damaging his vocal chords or dangerously increasing his blood pressure. One could say that his performance gets very close to overacting, but he totally pulls it off. This is one of his best performances.The movie looks phenomenal. It has peculiar grungy look. When I was younger watching this movie dubbed in my language it left an impression in my memory that it took place somewhere in Europe even though it is supposed to be New York. People's sweating faces and the cramped apartments with their run down dirty walls combined with Jean Reno's French accent and shot in a warm sepia tone give this film a foreign look. Its looks have characterThe soundtrack of this film mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric hums. Those violins give weight to the torment and I swear I could feel the heat getting heavier. If we want to find another problem with the film we have to go back to the girl. Look, for men who are not parents the whole age limit thing is bullsh*t, whether they would like to admit it or not, and by default guys are basically dogs, so parading a 12 / 13 year old girl in a choker is a cheap trick for a movie maker. Arguably, Leon is an exploitation movie. It just happens to be a very good one, but I feel like our guard is down when reviewing this film due to our mind having been affected by the material. It is like Nabokov's Lolita. Suuure you are reading the book just for its literary qualityThis may calculate in your consideration when deciding which version of the movie to watch. The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny. The short version is cleaner but far less emotionally loaded, cutting out one especially important heart to heart scene.Leon is a little silly and exploitative but it is one of the best thrillers and one of Luc Besson's best work.",8,2,2,6 February 2015
Oblivion," A deceptive experience
","The moment this movie signaled a sharp downhill turn for me was when two people were fighting over a gun and the gun accidentally went off, while another person was observing the fight from relatively far away. Instantly, this made me think of a trope that a number of action movies from the 90s and 80s used, in which a stray gunshot like this would accidentally hit someone important to the main hero, but my mind pushed that memory away, as I was sure that this smart movie would not stoop so low as to use such a cliché. Sure enough, a moment later it was revealed that the observer got shot. Even worse, this person was apparently unaware of getting shot at first, which also happens in action movies sometimes, but makes little sense in a situation like this.The clean bright look of the machines, the architecture and characters' wardrobes, as well as a potent sci-fi soundtrack, make you feel like you are watching something original and intelligent, but as the movie progresses, you may realise that this is a Frankenstein's monster, patched together from a number of other older movies and games (Portal specifically), wrapped in a fresh package.On top of that, as the story progresses, it raises a few important questions that never get answered, thereby creating plot holes that make the plot feel unrealistic and dumb. And while this is not a very wordy movie, much of the dialogue that's there is not great. There is a lot of exposition through talking instead of showing and there are meaningless one-liners that are only there because they sound cool.Therefore, Oblivion goes from a seemingly interesting promise to an increasingly disappointing dumb action movie. It does look good all the way through and there are a few cool sci- fi turns, so at least there is that.",6,2,3,5 March 2017
Bohemian Rhapsody," The story is a missed opportunity and lowers the overall value
","The main show here is Malek. This movie is his masterpiece. His energetic antics on stage, his accent, his prosthetic buck teeth and his tragic tension bring Freddie Mercury to life. He is the most interesting thing in this movie, as he should be. The second most interesting thing is everyone else's performance, especially Ben Hardy's, playing Roger Taylor.The last thing that stands out is the historical polish. The 70's and 80's are faithfully recreated, along with all the Freddie's funky clothes. The flying camera shots of the giant crowd at the Live Aid concert are impressive. This is all somewhat expected, considering the film's high budget.But that is where the interesting things end, unfortunately. All the other aspects of the film are good, but to me, nothing else stands out enough to justify the standing ovation that this movie seems to be receiving from the public.The story, in particular, is one big missed opportunity. It would have been interesting to see Freddie's development as a singer in his younger days, perhaps his flight from his country of birth. There is none of that. Once Freddie meets the band, he is already the perfect singer. From then on, it's a steady rise upward and the film ends at the top of Queen's fame. There is drama towards the end, but that drama is touched upon lightly and treated like a nuisance in an otherwise awesome hall of awesomeness.One of the more interesting historical moments with regard to Queen was the release of the fatalistic song The Show Must Go On right in the middle of the rumours about the singer's health. None of that either. That songs gets played during the credits.The part of the story about the break-up of the band feels like it's been taken out of a cheesy kids' movie about a teenage band and the dialogue is appropriately cheesy.In short, this film is about great performances and it is a nice audio-visual treat for those who are interested in the band. Malek's performance is well worth the price of admission. There is, however, little else of note.",7,2,3,20 November 2018
North by Northwest," Awesome.
","There is one problem with this movie: the plot. It is too convenient and far-fetched. Characters are a little too stupid for the sake of the plot, mostly the main character, whenever it suits the movie. There is a scene where the main character gets attacked in a manner that would fit a James Bond film but this particular occasion does not call at all for such an attack, except for the show of course.Some movies like L.A. Confidential have too many minor layers that may end up losing the viewer, while this film goes the opposite direction, as far as to make its characters clarify out loud what had just occurred when it is not at all necessary.However, you will not care about the contrivance issue because the general structure of the film is so nice, it is so well shot and the performances are so great that the rest does not matter.The tension can be cut with a knife, and once it starts, it continues with barely a break until the end. Even though the movie can be a bit predictable, you cannot wait to see what happens next anyway.This is one of the more original and better looking movies. There are neat little tricks Hitchcock with the camera that keep surprising and this is all done in the 1950s may I remind. The mood of location is conveyed with excellency, like showing the vast middle-of-nowhere by shooting from a hight with a good long perspective.Perhaps a minor note, but this film also has quite a few good looking night scenes for the time. Many of the movies of this era use the day-for-night technique where the scene is shot in the daylight and then darkened in post-processing, which always looks really fake. North by Northwest does this much better, through a variety of techniques.Perhaps one visual issue is that it tends to use a lot of matte paintings to fill out the background and unfortunately some of them are quite noticeable.A brief word on the music: it goes a long way to help the movie feel tense. You hear those careful brass tunes pulsating and keeping the pressure at the surface.In addition this film has good actors all round, especially the villains, who aren't full of anger or fake laughter like in so many films, but polite, intelligent and sharp looking. Especially the young Martin Landau has a brilliant expression on his face, which can turn very devious while hardly changing at all.North by Northwest is, despite its plot issues, a very very good movie. This is the sort of film that makes a person want to find and watch every Hitchcock movie there is out there.",9,1,4,12 December 2014
Coriolanus," Quality manageable Shakespeare movie
","I don't like Shakespeare.I tried him on multiple occasions and in multiple forms and by now I could write an essay on all the reasons why.However, Coriolanus the movie, is very palatable and the lack of popularity this movie has puzzles me as much as the popularity that Shakespeare has.There are some familiar core problems. Some of the dialogue is poetic nonsense, for which you have to pause and rewind so as to try grasp for some meaning. There are some issues with the story as the wordy dialogues sometimes ignore to explain some basic story aspects, motivations or fail to concentrate on the plot making the movie feel on the slow side. Again, not sure that is the movie's fault rather than Shakespeare's (or the source Shakespeare ripped off). For example, the two main men of this film state that they want to be together and then repeatedly say that they hate each other, with no clear explanation for either of those polar opposite attitudes.The general dialogue is nonetheless understandable so that one can follow it. It is helped by the good acting of everyone involved. Ralph Fiennes in the main role portrays the Roman general Coriolanus with his overly proud screws loose. His eyes alone could cut you. Good casting there.The main hook of the movie is that the it is Shakespeare in modern times where Rome is shown in the style of a Western country while the Volsci neighbors are shown in the cultural style of the Balkans. This is not completely novel but it works well and the cultural styles are portrayed well, interesting to look at. There is a lot of hand held camera (but not shaky cam) and it makes things look more gritty and personal. Good cinematography overall, though the real action is not well shot as the cuts are too fast..The overall plot is interesting. There are no real villains, which is always refreshing. There is no cheesy love interest or a hero. The movie instead explores the clash between patriotism, personal pride and duty to your people. It is an off-beat story.With so many movies being a copy of the same 4-chord pop song formula, this Shakespeare based film is like a breath of fresh air. And on top of that, it is well-acted and for most part well shot.",8,0,2,10 July 2015
Aliens," Still one of the best action movies of all times
","I need to get a little personal here to properly explain the situation.Aliens, has long been one of my favorite movies, and ever since I was a kid, it held preference over its predecessor, Alien. I recognized that the first film was an high quality product, but it was scary and there were not nearly enough explosions. Its sequel, on the other hand, contained much of the aesthetic and story of the first film but was encased in a much more palatable (for a kid at least) action movie skin. However, as an adult, having watched the two movies back to back I see that both movies are showing some unfortunate seams, but those seams are bigger on the 2nd film.The tension in the first film was palpable right from the beginning. Aliens feels much more relaxed. In part, this is because the said Aliens are much more vulnerable this time around, but there are other reasons that are sadly a symptom of a reduction in quality. For example, the first film had creepy sound effects mixed in with the space music that made the exploration really tense. Aliens does not have that, or at least very little.Right at the beginning, something bad happens but then the character just wakes up and it turns out to be a dream. You know, if I saw some movie do that trick for the first time I would have called it a smart trick, but since so many thrillers started doing the waking up from a bad dream trick, it has become a hated cliché.The writing is of mixed quality. Most of the lines uttered by the marines in the first half of the film are bad. I understand that the creators were trying to make the marines out as macho grunts but what they ended up with are exaggerated gestures and cheesy meaningless lines made out of messed up army lingo, like when 'fire in the hole' is meant literally. The thing is, even the dumb dialogue contributes to the overall atmosphere and some of the lines have become iconic quotes.The characters are fun and memorable. Little bits, some of them silly, can be great. A guy wakes up from hibernation and his first action is to put a cigar in his mouth. Sigourney Weaver is back of course as the strong female lead. She is strong but vulnerable, which is a popular hero type because a character like that is relatable. Paul Reiser is really good. His character is realistic and the way it is revealed over the course of the film feels natural. A little adorable girl Newt is played by Carrie Henn. Newt is cute kid but the quality of her acting varies. Either way she does not talk a lot. Aliens is one of Bill Paxton's most famous movie's. He overacts a bit, but remains very entertaining. Nobody in this film is bad.The music is not as tense and integrated with the film as in the first film but nonetheless the film does have really iconic action music formed around the core of army snare drums and metallic percussion.The design of the humans world has been improved over the first film. The colony buildings and the various machines look really cool. It highly recommended that you watch directors' cut to not miss out on any of that. Yes, small CRT screens look outdated by their size and static just adds to the creepy atmosphere. The Aliens look quite good. Their movements are a little clunky, but on the upside no CGI was used to put the on screen and film cuts are done professionally to make aliens as realistic as possible. This helps the movie to age well.There are still visual issues though. There are a number of scenes where mock up models are superimposed onto a different background, possibly using green-screen, and it does not look that good. There is an outline visible around the objects and it simply looks odd. Strangely enough, the first film did not have this problem nearly as much as it did not try to add so many effects with moving vehicles.Aliens has some of the most quoted memorable lines but also a whole lot of weak ones. The music is pretty cool. The action is good too but there is not as much tension. Despite the flaws, the atmosphere and the characters are so good that Aliens can rightfully be called one of the best action movies of all times as well as one of the best sci-fi movies.",8,2,5,3 January 2015
Spirited Away," Captivating and pretty
","Spirited Away was the strangest acid trip I ever had.Hayao Miyazaki is the master of the gorgeous and lively animation with a kooky side and Spirited Away is arguably his magnum opus. As such it is also the kookiest.The story is a little hard to describe. The basic premise is that a girl gets stuck in the spirit world, but the larger part of the rest of the story can be described as 'random stuff happens'. Or sometimes the problem is that for a while not much happens while the mood or tension is being set. This is not necessarily a problem. The story is an experience of exploration and discovery of the world and of the girl's character and that experience is really good.Also, I may be reading more into this film than there is but there seems to be something more in Spirited Away besides the events at hand. Certain images and characters appear to comment on or be inspired by real life, perhaps specifically of contemporary Japan. There is a ghost character that eventually starts talking with an old person's voice and really wants to be with the little girl, gets offensive and invasive but then explains that he is just really lonely....I don't know.As the movie was drawing to a close, though, the story started getting wrapped up rather unnaturally. It felt sappy, which is fine for the kids but may be a bit harder to swallow for adults.There are also some issues with the characters. They are interesting but their behavior changes suddenly, as well as the attitude of other characters towards them. This is possible to attribute to the fact that the characters are spirits, but they behave consistently otherwise so the occasional sudden shift is weird.Visually...well, visually is what this anime is all about. Miyazaki's style of drawing is a matter of taste, but it can be argued that it is not particular sexy or detailed. The eyes are round, the mouths are simple. However the movement and the colors are great. The animation is very lively. Miyazaki achieves this in part by adding little details, little extra movements that are not necessary but add realism, like someone stumbling briefly. Effort is made to animate the main character's movements that show fear and hesitation, which again gives more life.Spirited Away is every trippy beautiful experience that requires some patience on the part of the viewer, since actual plot points are somewhat vague, few and far between.",8,0,1,22 December 2014
Legends of the Fall," A collection of pretty videos of good actors
","This film occasionally shows up on TV. I didn't want to go to sleep and there was nothing else to kill time with so I watched it. Seemed to be going somewhere - was slowly shaping up to be a heavy drama...but then it went somewhere else...and then somewhere else. It kept going and every time I thought it was about to end...it kept going. I eventually tuned out and changed the channel, watched another movie, perhaps a show or two, then went to exile for 25 years, went into cryostasis as societies of the world collapsed and mountains were eroded by wind. Then I returned, found the old TV, turned it on and...the bloody movie was still going! And after it was finally done, with a somewhat anti-climactic finale, I could not for the life of me tell you what this movie was about. It went here and it went there. It went everywhere. In the end, it is a movie about a father and sons living a life in the first part of the 20th century. Well that is fine and all, but why is it worth making a movie about? What saves this movie: characters. Brad Pit and Anthony Hopkins can combine powers to make even the worst turd look like gold. And these two actors really shine in this movie and manage to grab your attention for a while, but even they cannot do it forever and sooner or later you are returned to the void that is the story of this movie.Yes certain scenes are really good and carry weight, but you need a good glue to bind the pretty pictures together. You need to keep the show moving. A book with great drawings still needs the words in between the drawings to be good.The movie wears a veneer of art and I have a sneaky suspicion that this is why the movie is so overrated: as it pretends to be smart and artistic, some people are pretending to like it so as not to appear stupid or shallow.In short: good actors, good scenery, but a long and flat story.",5,1,2,30 January 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fun action and characters at the cost of common sense
","Desolation of Smaug has the job of convincing audiences that this new Tolkien trilogy is worthy of their attention, after a somewhat dragged out and toned down first part.This time the action has been boosted. Introduction of elven characters, especially the return of Legolas, is essentially the introduction of acrobatic super-warriors, but the dwarfs also do more fighting this time around and even the hobbit has turned into a fighter. And as the title suggests we also finally brush up with our dragon Smaug.The actors are more fleshed out. While most of the dwarfs remain nameless background characters, at least a few of them get developed a bit more and get their own scenes. It's nice to see more variety in the type of characters and Benedict Cumberbatch makes for a great evil dragon.Maybe it is just me getting increasingly higher standards, but while the action is nice, the script of Desolation of Smaug really starts to get on the nerves towards the 2nd half of the movie. Characters say and do whatever serves the story at that particular time. It's contrived and obvious. It is clear that the animators wanted to create particular scenes or special effects, and the characters act as set pieces in those scenes, whether it makes sense for them to be or not.The increased action, however nice, causes a problem for the story that I fear many people do not think about. For example, the whole point of the hobbits is that little and seemingly weak creatures can overcome huge challenges through bravery and perseverance....not through becoming sword wielding spider fighters like Bilbo did at one point. That's missing the point! The movie does have charm and it is fun to see known characters mess around gorgeous environments, as long as you are able to suspend your disbelief.",7,2,4,21 April 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Entertaining but not without flaw
","You know, as ridiculous as the first Misison Impossible was, it maintained one foot in seriousness at all times. Ghost Protocol on the other hand sometimes acts like a parody of itself, of spy movies in general. The first 10 Minutes in particular gave a wrong impression of the rest of the film.As I was watching the first scene, I thought that it was going to be revealed that this is all a movie set and the guy running is an actor and then the scene will segue its way to the real action and the real main character. I was especially convinced of this when at the end of the scene there was a smart phone with a full-screen picture of a woman with the word 'ASSASSIN' typed over it in huge font, all caps. I thought someone will now say 'Cut!' and later the real characters will drive through the set because they are in a high speed chase through the city or something. But NO! The first scene was part of the movie! These were actual characters we are supposed to believe in! .........Hahahahaha! The movie does this a number of times, but thankfully most of the humour is intentional, though there may be just a little too much of it. One of the main characters is played by Simon Pegg who is a comedy actor and he acts as a comedy relief character in this, but he is also very much in the foreground taking up just as much time as Tom Cruise's main character. It doesn't hurt the movie, it's just a different tone than the one I expect from these films.The main premise is a most cliché and unimaginative ever. Something nuclear weapons, crazy bad guy. In fact, anytime any subplots or background story raised their heads, any time the film tried to be emotional, it was a letdown. But who cares? It's not important. Everything plot related is just an excuse for a particular scene and those scenes are well worth it.The movie looks really impressive. The technology used by the spies looked very cool, as it usually does in Mission Impossible movies. The action and the locations where the action takes place are diverse, from Russian basements to Middle Eastern skyscrapers. Acrobatics are great and Tom Cruise looks in good shape performing them.Tom Cruise gives it their best as usual. A cool addition to the cast is the Russian actor Andrei Mashkov, who I am really glad is still active in movies, but the movie did not give him much to do and he could have just as easily been cut out altogether. The bad guy is a real disappointment though. There is no strong villain involved, just a guy who appears on screen every now and then, doing his villain stuff, only saying a word or two.MI Ghost Protocol is a technically very effective action movie, but shallowness of story, a weak villain and a few corny scenes prevent it from reaching higher. If you are in it for good action and nothing else though then it comes highly recommended.",7,0,2,22 June 2014
Lawrence of Arabia," Epic visual experience. A few minor story issues.
","It took me about five minutes of screen time to realize that was going to like this movie. Key behind that realisation is the introduction of the main character of the film. Peter O'Toole plays an intelligent and cheeky Thomas Lawrence 'Lawrence of Arabia' with an exquisitely charming arrogance.Lawrence of Arabia is a phenomenal looking film. The scenes contract and grow. A small speckle of a man on horizon with quiet music in the background grows into a riding warrior with a roar of the main theme. It is amazing in how many different ways the film manages to show the majestic desert. And although having a large quantity of actors is not a merit, it sure does make an impression when a few hundred of them charge on horseback. This film can fill a person with wanderlust.Music plays a very important part in the presentation of the visuals and the makers were clearly quite proud of the orchestral compositions. The theme of Lawrence of Arabia is instantly recognizable. Unfortunately, the main hook of the theme does overstay its welcome as it comes back at the slightest opportunity, albeit in different form.If there is one word for this film it is 'epic'. it is so in every way. In way of story, the Arab uprising during World War I was of importance to its outcome and subsequent history. In way of visuals, the large battles and the massive desert capture the mind. In way of characters, flamboyant historical leaders. This film is so epic it is one of those movies that has an overture,and an intermission with an entr'acte.A cool thing about Lawrence of Arabia is how relevant it still is. 'So long as the Arabs fight tribe against tribe,' he said, 'so long will they be a little people, a silly people'. No offense to the Arab readers, but those who know something about the current state of affairs know how much this still applies. The general themes in the film are timeless, much like the deserts.So is it perfect? No, it has a number of unnatural moments in its story. There is a character in this film who is shown to be a cold and unpleasant person, but over a fairly short period of time he is suddenly transformed into a good guy and the protagonist goes from hating him to being friendly. The way Lawrence persuades another hostile characters to join him later on also still puzzles me.This film thoroughly rubs the spirit of Thomas Lawrence. The man is portrayed as half god, almost always right and successful. 'The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away' is actually a plot point in this movie. The main character does get humbled, but only for a short time. I understand that the character thinks much of himself but the movie clearly agrees with him.This handling of character is not necessarily a flaw in itself but it adds to the aforementioned unnatural feel this movie sometimes has. Also, as you may imagine, the God comparison may be somewhat offensive to religious people. There is a central theme in this movie in which the Muslims keep indicating that 'it was written' referring to predestination belief that appears in both Muslim and Christian faiths, but Lawrence keeps indicating and proving through his acts that nothing is written for him, and convincing those around him it seems. Lawrence indirectly compares himself to Moses and his servants tell him 'it shall be so, Lord' as he wears white robes. Meanwhile, one of the Arab chieftains is shown to be greedy and the Arabs are shown to be barbaric.Nevertheless, Lawrence of Arabia is one of the most interesting films of all time. It is pretty and smart and makes you wonder about it after you are done watching it.",8,0,1,4 December 2014
City of God," ...
","In City of God, the brilliance in movie making is rivaled only by the brutality.It seems every technique known to man has been utilised in making film, which makes it feel like a masterpiece in the original medieval sense of that word. In particular, there is a lot of hand held camera and quite close up shots, which make sense and make the film really tangible and personal.The writing is brilliant. A kid asks another kid what his name is during a brawl and the narrator uses that opportunity to tell the audience his name. A lot of smart little things like that, but the story itself also has a good structure and smart turns. I watched a whole lot of Oscar-winning Hollywood movies and they have just been dwarfed by this Brazilian one, but this crime drama is a really heavy movie to sit through. There is some really really messed up stuff here. Be warned. And in that regard, I have been a little bit sceptical about how believable the extreme villainy of some of the kids in this movie is (and characters in general), but after reading and seeing some of the recent events in the world, I guess I have to adjust my views of reality.This film puts me in a strange position. On the one hand I cannot deny the brilliance of the film. One the other hand, from the entertainment perspective, the film left me feeling kind of uncomfortable.",9,1,3,15 July 2016
Frozen," Quality Disney production, maybe a little too much singing
","I cannot decide what my problem is with this film. I narrowed it down to 2 possibilities: either 1) there is too much singing and silliness or 2) I am just not 10 years old anymore. I guess it is mostly the latter.Those who have not seen Frozen probably probably still heard about 'Let it go', a song from the movie that went viral on social media. It is a good song and Frozen has several of them, all of which are nice but which, in my opinion, belong on an separately sold album. They are essentially all standalone songs and they take up half of the movie. I don't remember Alladin or Beauty and the Beast being so singy. Frozen is just short of being a musical and I do not like musicals.The basic story is about a Nordic princess with ice superpowers that end up causing her and her kingdom a lot of trouble as she struggles to control those powers.What is nice about the plot is that it is not obvious or overly simplistic and the final moral message goes just a bit off the beaten path. The whole thing has a certain welcome asymmetry about it. It borrows somewhat from the Snow Queen fairytale, which was itself not your standard story.Nothing special about the acting though. It is all good, but a few months after seeing the movie, the only memorable character is the comic relief snowman, Olaf, played by Josh Gad. The rest of the characters are a bit generic. Of course the two male and the two female leads are going to be pretty, their voices smooth and their bodies shaped according to the old-fashioned Disney standards for protagonists. The most memorable thing about them is the singing.The art is good, probably because it paces itself and knows when to strike the viewer with the money shot in order the make the largest impression. The thing about snow though is that it does not need a lot of texture or color. Of course it poses its own challenges when you have to animate its movement and that is done well.Frozen is a solid production, but it is not revolutionary.",7,3,6,8 March 2014
Ghost Rider," Did not hate it
","Is this movie memorable? Apart from the flaming scull, no. Is it a great movie? No. Was Underworld a great movie? Not really, no. Was Resident Evil? No. They are not bad movies, but they are no works of art either. They are quick dark superhero B-movies meant to appeal to the emo 13 year-old boys of the new generation, so I do not think it is fair to hold Ghost Rider to a different standard.The main issues with the movie are: 1. A weak villain. Wes Bentley was not bad but he was more like a villain's henchman rather than the villain himself.2. Nicolas Cage's acting did not fit the movie. He played it straight. He was acting a poor tormented man, taking his stuff way too seriously. Why would the makers go with that approach? The premise of the movie clearly required goofiness, which Cage could have totally provided. That is what you hire the guy for and yet his potential was not used.3. The story...I can't remember any of it. The script as a whole was a bit of a mess. Something about the deal with the devil and the flaming scull. That is all.But the movie also has a few good things in it: 1. The Ghost Rider. The action parts with the Ghost Rider were a lot of fun. He looks great. I never got tired of that flaming skeleton on a bike. Yes, of course it's just CGI, but it still looked awesome. There was a scene where he rides on the side of a building. It was ridiculous and great. I generally just liked the the art in this movie.2. The sound design. The roaring engine of the bike, the dark music, the metal chain smacking around. I really liked the cling clang sound mood that this movie had.All in all, I do not know what people expected this would be. It's a B action movie with little to no story in it. Just go with it.",6,1,1,16 September 2014
Hellboy," A celebration of visuals with a layer of stupid
","This film is held up by pillars of style. It is a bag of cool camera shots and ideas for cool scenes (something its sequel would expand upon). On their own, these shots are great, containing a wonderful integration of color themes, shot composition, make up and interesting props. Even the outdated CGI doesn't look too bad, mostly because the digital effects are properly mixed in with practical effects. But the bindings that tie these cool shots together into an actual story are of poor quality and I found myself constantly trying to ignore the annoying nonsense in between the good stuff...in vain. Here is an example. A monster jumps through the front of a moving subway train and out of the other end, as it tries to run away from Hellboy. Hellboy, however, gets dragged under the said train for a while and then gets left on the ground. However, in the next shot, the monster is standing directly above Hellboy, looking around. This kind of nonsense is non-stop, permeating the movie from beginning to end, and it is very distracting.Hellboy is one of Ron Pearlman's better roles, despite the fact that his face is under a layer of make-up and his lines mostly consist of monotone gruffs. Jeffrey Tambor's and Doug Jones' characters provide a good colorful counterbalance to the said gruffness of the main character. However, everybody's lackluster dialogue complements the aforementioned flawed storytelling and together they keep this movie below its potential.I am glad the makers fixed a lot of the problems in the sequel. This first film is still worth watching though, even if only for the charm.",6,1,1,7 March 2018
The Mist," Lot's of mist but no fire...
","Let's get something straight first: The Mist is supposed to be a horror movie. Horror movies are supposed to keep you thrilled. With that in mind, I believe the makers of The Mist didn't do a splendid job, as this movie wastes way too much precious filming tape on all the wrong things.The storyline is not complicated. We're introduced into a small town that is being swallowed in thick mist after a storm the night before. People who get exposed to the outside get killed by strange life forms, and in these circumstances a group of people is locked inside a convenience store puzzled as to what they should do next.It takes forever before the real action starts, about a half of the movie in fact. On its own this fact isn't necessarily a mood killer. A long and scary run up can be a good thing, but the first 50 minutes of this long (app 2 hours) movie you will spend on listening to the somewhat empty chat between the different characters. Here's another problem that is within a problem. Conversation can be interesting even if lasts 50 minutes, but the conversation in The Mist isn't going anywhere. It consists out of cheesy and rather stupid dialogue. The actors do a fine job, but the script fails them. Much of the attention is given to a psychotic religious woman who keeps saying the same thing about the doomsday over and over. At some point what the characters say and do starts to irritate. After watching this movie one might get an impression that the majority of humans are complete morons with a single digit IQ, primitive superstitions, no will power and no logic. Of course that's true to some degree (definately in a horror movie), but the movie basically makes fun out of people and religion.The Mist is mostly about the interactions between the survivors. The mysterious disaster at hand is given very little attention, which I should admit is quite realistic. The main characters do not try to solve the epic problem that they do not understand, and are instead concerned with their own safe being only. There are quite a few surprises in the plot, including a very unconventional ending. The movie keeps enforcing a very depressive mood.The action itself is pretty interesting. Good special effects and design give the 'bad guys' a very distinct look. Interaction with the non-virtual world is realistic. The camera work is solid. The idea of a thick mist is a nice one, as the mist substitutes for the night time and the unknown in general.The VerdictIf you get through the first half of the movie without falling a sleep, you will be up for a cool encounter. The stupidity doesn't however stop once the action starts. This still is an interesting flick to see.",6,1,4,8 December 2007
I Am Legend," A movie that manages to keep your mouth open until the end credits start rolling
","I am legend is a new look at and apocalyptic epidemic. In the sense of the plot it most closely resembles the still fresh in memory flick: 28 Days Later. In the sense of the quality of the execution it is far better than anything of its kind.The story follows Robert, a scientist who is, apparently, the only human who remained unaffected by a horrible pandemic that slithered across the world a few years ago. Robert attempts to survive, and at the same time, do something about the situation.I Am Legend is one of those movies that can serve as the learning material for young directors. It's a masterpiece in its original sense: a professional product that incorporates the best of each acquired skill.It starts with Will Smith, who is the first sign of the high aim of this production. Since throughout about 90% of the movie the attention is centered on one man, it makes sense to pick carefully, and Will does deliver.The picture is nicely built. Transitions, like the ones with flashbacks, are particularly notable. There are moments when the camera follows the character around and shakes naturally; there are special angles and zoom-ins.Special effects are used but not abused. The abandoned city, monsters and explosions are there in the necessary amount and give the movie a distinct flavor.The sound is one of the most notable things about the movie. It plays a large role in scene transitions and the music really pumps up the excitement of each scene.I Am Legend is a must see, as an important moment in filming history. It's not quite epic, but it's something that works in every aspect.",8,1,2,27 December 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," Cringeworthy
","What the heck happened? I guess kids took over. That's what happened.The obvious and brainless dialogue, nonsensical plot points, scenes that exist for no other reason than to exist, and thick exposition read out loud, covered by thick layer of CGI. It all makes me think that this film was constructed in a lab to appeal to kids who don't know any better. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw cartoony drawings of pirate Jack Sparrow as if they were leaflets at the Disney park.The thing is, I am not sure it works for kids either, because there is metric ton of poorly weaved story beats that a kid would probably not care about. Some plot points appear to require you to have prior knowledge of previous movies, which makes things even more confusing. If you're going to make a movie that appeals only to kids, what's the point of adding complexity.I don't know what I expected. I guess I expected that Javier Bardem and Johnny Depp are worth something, and they are at times, but the rest of the movie isn't and the two actors cannot save it. Even though Depp is doing his old tired act he's become known for, it's still entertaining at times. Whenever Bardem is on screen, that's when the movie captures your attention. The dialogue doesn't become any smarter, but somehow he is able to sell it well. But then the guy goes away for a while, and everything goes right back to suck kingdom.This movie is an exceedingly dumb CGI fest and it's not for adults. May I suggest finding a youtube supercut of all the scenes with Bardem in it.",5,1,1,26 May 2019
Brave," Overestimated a bit but solid
","Let us get it out of the way first: the animation looks awesome. The atmosphere, the design, the movements - it all looks great and it is a shame we do not see more of it.The characters are also great at their base value - distinct, likable and cute.A good foundation has been set However, the hype for Brave actually seems to have carried it higher then it would have flown otherwise, on its own wings.In true 21st century fashion, the story concentrates around a teenager girl who is rebellious and stronger than her society sees her or wants her to be. Several chieftains' sons compete in a tournament with her marriage as prise but, as the trailers showed you, she enters the tournament to compete for her own hand. You know what, let us just write 'feminist' on her back, put her in pants and call it a day.Without giving too much away, the rest of the story is bland and cliché, or rather a combination of clichés. It's not entirely predictable, but just because you mix the clichés up doesn't mean that the product is going to be original, people! Having said that, the reason why Brave is not predictable is also not positive: it tends to have a problem with the flow. Like a malfunctioning gearbox it switches to strange gears at wrong times. I also did not like the logic that the film imposes on the viewer, especially in its ending, which feels rushed, as if the producer came into the room of the developers and said 'Ok that's enough messing around, finish it off now!' and so they did.The bottom line: while the animation and characters are good, the story is bland, strange and comes off as preachy without having a message to preach. Having seen it some time ago, I cannot remember much about Brave beyond its pretty colors. There is nothing strikingly bad about it so what it is is average.",6,0,2,9 February 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," A few problematic scenes but a really fun ride
","I don't think there is much of a point of telling you that this movie is good. A seemingly endless amount of positive reviews speaks for itself. The movie surpassed $200M in box office revenues. However, perhaps we all got a little carried away in our communal cheering. This movie is not without sins.I continue to lack understanding for the argument that action movies do not have to adhere to realism. I do not see the need for the sacrifice. Towards the end of the movie I lost count how many times this flick broke the laws of physics and I felt it did not have to. According to this film, being encased in a ball of wooden branches makes you survive a crash. Come on! Sometimes one is able to suspend disbelief, but sometimes the violation of truth pulls you right out of the movie. Suddenly you are just an ape wearing 3d glasses and starring at a large screen.The other issue with the movie is a number of movie clichés. Maybe this says more about the number of movies we, the public, have been spoiled with over the years, but throughout this film I saw scenes from Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and Serenity. Sometimes, either during or shortly after such a cliché, the movie would acknowledge it with a joke or a little twist, but if it is so self-aware then why did it not avoid such scenes in the first place? I mean here was the one chance to be different. The movie has a talking raccoon in it and yet the makers still decided to stick to formula. I don't get it.The plot resembles Serenity quite a bit. A crew of rogues with a spaceship, who do not all like one another, are thrown by fate into a situation that eventually turns them into heroes. And I am sure Serenity probably took it from somewhere else. Again, come up with some new stuff, people.Another issue is that some characters change their motivations mid-movie without there being a discernible character arc justifying the change. The main male protagonist is portrayed as a scoundrel for the first 80% of the movie and then suddenly he is convincing others to be altruistic, including those who were already established to be more so than him. That felt forced and contrived, like the makers remembered that they had to wrap this movie up so they started cutting corners.In fact, with the story containing so many different characters and motivations, this movie really could have used another 30 minutes or so of screen time. The backstory is explained in about 30 seconds and if you didn't pay attention, too bad. Here's a bad guy, he looks evil; moving on.As already mentioned, the movie is good. The visuals are pretty. It manages to be funny, which often does not work out in action movies. But it is unfortunate that it feels the need to trod in formula. I hope that next time, in the inevitable sequel, Gunn just takes a left and doesn't look back.",8,1,3,18 August 2014
Black Hawk Down," Good action and not much else.
","There is a certain infamous stereotype about American action movies in general and war movies in particular, in which a white main character guns down a legion of faceless incompetent enemies, usually of non-white ethnicity. An additional part to this stereotype is the propagation of some message to give our heroes some great cause as an excuse to kill a bunch of people. Black Hawk Down has good action and presentation but it is also a text book example of such a stereotypical movie. I am not complaining, but it seems the movie claims to being something more than it is and hence a deliberation is in order.The movie opens with a message about some local Somali warlord using hunger as a terror tool (Somali Civil War from 1990s), but the struggle of the local people and the mission at hand is just an excuse for our gun toting heroes to shoot some stuff. Once introduced, the plot has little to no significance. The rest of the film comprises of situations in which the US soldiers find themselves and the related firefights.There is a scene in this film where the US folks are surrounded by a group of Africans and these folks are jumping backward and forward, angry and loud. They are made to look like a bunch of incoherent gorillas or pack of hungry rabid dogs.The movie looks very cool. Helicopters land almost on your head with various cool angles and viewpoints, like the overhead satellite view. Smoke and dirty texture come at you through the screen. There are enough cool firefights and rocket launches.The presentation is very effective in large part due to the music. Behind it is the Hollywood's top man Hans Zimmer. The action music has Arabic influence but also has some Western distorted guitar mixed in. It is good and could be subsequently recognized in other people's video projects. However it is the involvement of other artists that makes the music special. The sorrowful singing of Baaba Maal, Denez Prigent and Lisa Gerard cuts into your soul.There is a load of high grade actors in this film, which seems to be in line with other big war movie productions like the Thin Red Line and Saving Private Ryan, which shows this movie's aim despite it not having the same epic setting. The value of this choice can be put into questions when these guys spend so much of the movie's time covered in helmets, goggles and dust that makes them difficult to recognize.Black Hawk Down is pretty good action movie. As long as you do not expect it to be more than a good male-dominated gun fight, it should not hurt to see.",8,1,2,26 December 2014
The Dark Knight," The ultimate superhero movie?
","This is going to be a little personal.Batman was my favorite superhero when I was a kid. He is one of the few superheroes that do not owe their powers to some pseudo-scientific event, which means that he is a believable superhero. Also he is dark, which I could identify with. The only problem I thought was that the movies were not serious enough. A lot of whimsical silliness.I stopped caring about superheroes as an adult but then eventually I decided to give The Dark Knight a watch.If I was still a kid, this would have been the movie that would make me as excited as a schoolgirl who was just asked out by the lead singer of her favorite boy-band.The Batman in this one is dark and serious, and so is the entire tone of the movie. Batman's car is not some glowing rocket but a concept military vehicle that looks like a stealth jet. The explosions and fights look great. This whole film is a dark sexy stealth jet.The acting is the next big reason to see the movie. Christian Bale as Batman is rather boring, which was especially shocking when I found just how much energy and range he can produce in his other movies. However, Batman is supposed to be that way - he is a dark background upon which other characters are painted and those other characters are really good.I am not going to stay on Gary Oldman or Morgan Freeman for long. These guys are established as really good actors and they do what they need to.The Joker. So, this is another thing I have to get personal about. I have had some psychological issues. The psychiatrist helped me a little, but...anyway, what's important is that Joker's motivations and philosophy presented throughout this movie echoed within me with scary realism. Not only that but I would argue that the Joker is right.Played by Heath Ledger, the Joker is probably the best villain of all times. So much so that I wonder if the actor had some demons inside him which he called upon for this role.The Dark Knight is the best Batman movie and probably the best super hero movie. That is all.",8,2,6,23 January 2015
Blood Diamond," Good, but can't decide if it wants to be serious or not
","Blood Diamond is about a quick little diamond smuggler partnering with a local black man, with the former looking to get rich and the latter looking to save his family.Movie has good camera work. Action is not too shaky and you can tell what is going on. And of course the beauty of Africa is guaranteed...as well as its wonderful civilian ugliness. You can tell the movie uses some CGI special effects on occasion but it does so sparingly enough. it looks OK.Sound is good too. You get the local folk music, local French speaking rappers and on occasion some orchestral music. It sets a good atmosphere and is not overbearing.Di Caprio's acting is not pleasant, but that is probably the point since he is playing a sleazy white guy. Sometimes he is convincing. Sometimes not so much.Blood Diamond is not a bad movie overall, but there is something off about its nature and I am going to try and pinpoint it for you.There is this one shot, a brief scene, that encompasses much that is wrong with the movie. A female character is sorrowfully looking at a refugee camp as the movie is convincing you how bad the situation is, but at the same time her shirt is unbuttoned just far enough for you to see her side-boob. She is standing there in the foreground together with the main protagonist, a blond white guy. Their black companion who's been searching for his family, is in the background and out of focus.The movie shows how bad the civil violence is, but at the same time the main protagonist is a white guy who, of course, happens to be an ex-soldier and who can gun down faceless black men like chewing bubblegum....and he is of course given a photogenic white love interest, because even though the story does not call for it, that is what all action and adventure movies from Hollywood gotta do, right? This movie has a hard time breathing life into its imagery and its message because it insists of retaining elements of a cliché western action movie. I am trying to avoid writing major spoilers here, but once you watch about ten minutes of this film, you can pretty much predict the rest of it by yourself. The creators did not go as far as was needed because they were probably afraid to lose Western audiences.And so, the story does not flow well, making strange choices, making some choices that belong in a movie that is serious about its material and choices that belong in a lighthearted action flick.But...It is entertaining. If you want a well put together action movie with an exotic tint, this will do.",7,1,1,26 November 2014
Singin' in the Rain," A bit of a mess.
","Every now and then comes along a movie so iconic, everyone knows its name, even if they haven't seen it. And sometimes the hype greatly overstates the value. Singin' in the Rain has its good moments but it is also a mess of a movie.The main romance in the film came out of nowhere. It has that age old cliché where two people do not like each other at first but then fall in love, except the cliché is done badly. The dislike is very sudden, feels very forced to the point that it seemed like the main female character could not act. After the initial dislike there is no natural progression to a warmer relationship. It just becomes a fact at one point so the romance also feels very sudden and forced.The story as a whole has a disorienting structure, getting interrupted by parts that do not belong.The film is saturated with little jokes and slapstick and almost none of that stuff is funny! After a while the dumb forced humour becomes painful. There is a character played by Donald O'Connor whose mission it is to be a harlequin that got high on speed. He has a good delivery and can be funny but he also overdoes the whole clown business to the point of his character becoming annoying.The actors are definitely capable when they want to be, they sing very well and they dance well too. But those 3 aspects (acting, singing and dancing) are not tied together well. Look, if you wanted to make some random songs, make an album and put it on a record. If you are making a film with a story then it has to make sense and the songs in it have to be related. That is not the case here.On top of that, the songs are not all good either. There are two songs, Singin' in the Rain and Good Morning (to a lesser degree), that are discernibly interesting. The rest are average, some with primitive rhymes and of questionable purpose in the movie. There is one song that starts for no apparent reason and is not about anything, with its few lyrics being nonsensical babble. It is several minutes of your life you will never get back. The song could have been cut out of the film and it would have lost NOTHING.Moreover, the music is constantly being interrupted either for a change in tune or for another scene or for a dancing part. I like tap dancing too but quitting and interrupting the music into which your brain is trying to tune feels horrible, like getting mentally slapped. These dancing parts are not brief pauses either; they last a while and they too get interrupted by slapstick or other dancing scenes. What a mess.As the movie was drawing to a close I was bored and tired of it (my partner tuned out after just 10 minutes). And that is despite the fact that certain parts of this film are bouncing of the wall hyperactive. The music is good, the acting is good, but the structure is wrong. Next time someone asks me to watch this movie, they will need to get me high first, because clearly that is what the makers were when they made it.",6,16,27,23 December 2014
Avatar," A new bar has been set
","James Cameron must have woken up one morning and got a revelation. An angel must have come to him and said: 'You have to use your power to create something unprecedented, something that will shake the very foundation of human psyche'. And so the idea for Avatar was born. Either that or James simply watched 'FernGully: The Last Rainforest' and then decided to redo it in 3D.Utilizing the full potential of the 3D technology with what must have been a massive budget, as well as catching the actors on a good year, the creators of Avatar have set a new bar for movies to come.The special effects are of course central to the film. There is hardly a frame where they are not present. The graphics astonish thanks to the realistic and high quality animation. Realistic movement in characters grabs even more of the viewer's attention thanks to all the freaky colours and lighting. Since the setting is an alien planet, the graphic artists had the freedom of creating beauty that does not exist down here at Earth.All the actors were believable and well articulated. Perhaps this was done not without the assistance of computer graphics. Is that cheating? Hard to say, when your jaw is on the floor. Not to mention that some, like Giovanni Ribisi - plays the bad corporate - did not get any help from the special effects and yet performed outstandingly.So have we hit perfection? Well...no. The story and its participants were getting progressively less mysterious and more cliché. Towards the end of the movie, the Na'vi alien people were less like aliens and more like a conglomeration of African, Jamaican and Arabic tribesmen, right down to what they were wearing, the noises they were making and their dialogue. The leader of the Na'vi is actually played by the Native American actor, Wes Studi, for crying out loud.Also, the whole hippie go-green hype (oil and mining companies - very bad, we get it already) may have been a little too obvious here. If you're going to create something so creative, why stop half way? After all, the concept itself is not particularly original. A little more brain and mystery would really have brought this creation further.The trip Avatar takes you on is well worth the money you will pay for watching it at a theater. Separately, some things can be criticized, but together, the experience is amazing and should not be missed, no matter what your taste in movies is. Avatar is entertainment at its 2009-best.",9,5,11,22 December 2009
Sicario," Tense
","Thanks partially to some of the best ever use of acoustic bass, this movie is very tense. The camera shots feel epic and the acting is excellent, or at the very least eccentrically entertaining.The only real issue I had is with the story. Towards the end, it stopped making sense. I went to wiki to look up whatever I missed and, no, it still doesn't quite make sense. It is a strange blemish on an otherwise well-executed movie.This is also not a very purposeful movie. A lot of shots are there to build atmosphere and not to tell a story. There is no big lesson or message in the end. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but some people like movies driven by intelligent message.",8,0,0,30 November 2016
Jack Reacher," Really interesting film with a wide mood range
","The last movie I saw before this one happened to be Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol and the problem I had with that film is that it was kind of dumb. The center was on the awesome action scenes and everything else was filler. Jack Reacher on the other hand may not necessarily be a super smart movie, but I was surprised to find in it a relatively interesting and intelligible detective story instead of an over the top action movie I would normally expect Tom Cruise to star in.The main issue I have with this film is the dialogue. Some phrasing sounded artificial, cartoony even, like something someone wrote for an episode of CSI rather than something a real person would actually say. I think that might have been intentional. Sometimes it would fit the stylistic approach of a comic book that this movie was slowly beginning to take as it was progressing.Either way, the rest of the screenplay was quite good. The story was not predictable and it grew at just the right pace. The movie had a low-key small-scale provincial feel to it, which I at first found disappointing, but this small scale gives the story room to grow, twist and turn and so it does. Some things you can see coming but others not. There are a few scenes in the film that, for just a second, deliberately make you presume the wrong thing. I have not seen a good detective story in a while and this is definitely one.Tom Cruise plays Jack Reacher, a guy who comes in when a murder suspect asks for him by name, and Jack is an interesting character to base a movie around. Jack knows what he is doing; he is intelligent and has some fighting skills thrown in for good measure. However, he is not invincible and does make mistakes. Also, his moral fiber is a little twisted. This brings realism to his character. Also the character is not revealed all at once but slowly, as the movie progresses.The story lost me a little with some of its weird decisions and a few unanswered plot questions, but overall I really liked the mixed tone of the movie.It has different vibes flowing through its veins. It has some really dark streaks but also some comedy, sudden slapstick comedy even. It has action and car chases but also some slower investigation work. The music at times sounds like it's from an adventure movie. It is an interesting chameleon.Also unusual are the morals this movie wears. I already mentioned the somewhat dark main character, and there are a few dubious decisions this character makes, which other good characters then accept. At the same time the bad guys are not vilified to the extreme and some people you expected to get punished do not get punished. I am not complaining. I loved it.In another movie, such a wide palette of tones, characters and morals would not have worked and the film would have felt all over the place and disjointed but in this film it works. This was a dark yet fun movie and different from anything I can recall seeing in the last few years.",8,4,6,28 June 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Goofy, entertaining, lacks power in the ending.
","There are guidelines against stating the score in the body of your review, but given the Imdb's inflexibility, I have to say that Guardians 2 is possibly the most 6.5-star movie I've ever watched. I remember how I complained about the ending to first Guardians movie having unrealistic physics. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 lets you know right away that it throws the physics out of the window, which frees you from having to worry about pesky things like realism and this creative choice appears to have been right one.In combination with an overwhelming amount of colourful CG, the flexible physics at times made me feel like I was watching another Shrek animation, and it was not annoying like it should have been.Compared to the first movie, the sequel turns up the goofiness knob quite a bit, and with it, also the funny knob. This movie is a comedy above anything else and that's where it shines. All you need is fun characters played by interesting actors, just doing their shtick.Perhaps the most notable thing about the movie is that it doesn't have a strong central storyline. There is a main villain, but he and his plan do not really enter the movie until about half way. Instead, this movie has 4 or 5 stories and themes running through it almost side by side, which is completely fine and does not feel disjointed.Unfortunately, the film went downhill for me in the second half, as prolonged action sequences were making increasingly less sense and the humour was replaced by conflict and forced drama. Also, if you think about this movie's value in the future, it's hard to ignore the amount of CGI used to make it and how bad it may look to the human eye 10 years from now. The costumes and character design are nice, but they are drowned out by fake explosions and monsters.In short, this movie is at its strongest in its middle section, when it is having fun and doesn't think too hard about anything. The last third of the movie starts losing momentum and entertainment value.",7,0,0,9 August 2018
The Godfather: Part III," Underwhelming but not bad
","I can see why.I can see why some people who watched the first 2 movies were severely disappointed after seeing this one.Watching this third movie right after the first two felt like somebody had dug up bits and pieces of Godfather I and II at some archaeological site and then tried to create the third movie based on the style of the found artifacts. All the aging actors are now trying to remember whom they were playing in the original movies and the director is standing in the corner trying to remember how to direct and the writers got pens in their mouth and their eyes on the ceiling trying to recall how the story ended.While the 2nd Godfather film had flown almost seamlessly out of the first, much about this third film is different. The tone has changed, with Al Pacino as Michael Corleone giving a much more subdued and humorous performance with those rising eyebrows that started dominating his later career. The people act contrary to their characters established by the first two movies. They try to make the gangster Michael Corleone some sort of anti-hero in this one, which is missing the point of the series.But at the same time the creators expect you to have watched the first two, because right from the start references are made to characters from the first two films without much explanation.Al Pacino is still good. But some of the other people are not as good. There is a certain Sofia Coppola who plays Corleone's daughter. Maybe the problem is that English was not her native language or she just had a bad year, but this lady really phones in her performance. Something goes wrong in the intonation at the end of every sentence she utters. And it doesn't help when the text she is given is not very good.In fact, the movie takes a number of dips in the quality of the dialogue. I got flashbacks about Star Wars prequels while listening to some of it. It is trying to be dramatic or poetic but often comes off as fake. It's not all bad though.The story centers on one of Corleone relatives played by Andy Garcia and that guy is always good, especially in gangster roles.Godfather III has its good and its bad times. It is unfortunately overshadowed by the greatness of its predecessors. Therefore, the best I can suggest is to for the viewers to do the same as what the movies did: watch the first and the second movie and then wait a while. Watch the third movie a few weeks or even years later. That way the contrast will not be as startling.",7,1,2,16 November 2014
Rosemary's Baby," Not a scary movie
","Suspense and subtlety. These are this movie's main strengths. It's carrying this tray full of glasses slowly and carefully. Everything is carefully constructed as the movie keeps the viewer on top of the story with little hints. There are no loud screams or startling sounds. The movie continues to carry this tray until the end and then...it just drops and smashes everything onto the ground with its comically ridiculous ending. What the heck, movie?!Although this movie is in many ways a prototype for the modern horror movies, it is in many ways the opposite of those movies, as it is not a horror movie. It is not even a thriller. Instead, it is a mystical psychological drama and it is a very slow- cooking one at that. This can mean that for many who are expecting to get excited, this movie will be quite boring. My girlfriend quit it half way out of boredom, and I understand where she was coming from.At least we had a few laughs about how bad some of the acting was. The writing for the dialogue was rather poor as well.This is not a great movie. It is nice to see something that attempts to approach the occult material with subtlety, but it is still poorly acted and not particularly interesting. And as I mentioned, that ending is f- ing horrible.",5,5,10,30 June 2017
All Quiet on the Western Front," Effective but with many flaws
","All Quiet on the Western Front has been hallmarked as one of the best and most important movies of the 20th century. However, despite this being an influential culturally important film, there are a number of problems with it that have to be addressed without influence from the film's popularity.The story has a well-paced traditional progression of the teenagers happily enlisting for war, then experiencing it and changing through it. It is interesting, even if you already know more or less what is going to happen, considering the subject matter. The movie proclaims at the beginning that it is not meant to show an adventure because war is no adventure, but it does have a very adventuresque and epic feel to it.Unfortunately, the writing and the way this film is directed make it feel very unnatural at times. There are times when the characters do not talk like real people would and their acting is very artificial, like 'I am acting now'. Actors either overact or underact. Some scenes last shorter than it feels they should.There is a short scene where a guy looks sad, the other guy says 'Oh come on' and the first guy smiles. Of course, that is how humans work. There was a moment when during a battle someone exclaimed out loud 'This is terrible' and it was hard not to laugh at a line like this.It is entirely possible that this is a style of dialogue that was chosen purposefully, but that does not make it any better. As a result of the lack of believability it is hard to get engrossed in the film.Yet again there are also a good deal of well-acted, heart-felt performances, especially towards the 2nd half of the film. Louis Wolheim and Lew Ayres play the two most prominent roles and are good charming actors. Lew, has a lot of subtle but deep expression in his face.However, the overall problem with the characters is that they are hardly introduced. We know almost nothing about them. The story centers the characters played by Lew and Louis and therefore, simply as a result of them being a lot on screen, you get to know their characters and recognize their faces, but everyone else is just the same. When these other people inevitably start dying you hardly notice. The movie tries to make a big deal out of one of the deaths but I could not even remember the guy's name.It is an impressive looking film, with good night scenes and explosions. It must have, at least for a while, have been the record holder for the most explosions in a movie. It is grim and good at delivering tension when it wants to. There are some really effective scenes that convey the tragically ironic nature of trench warfare.However, in the visual department there are also some problems. You know how in the older days there were not many special effects for people getting shot. Well that is fine, but when soldiers are pretending to throw grenades and there is clearly nothing being thrown, you must admit that is weird. You are telling me you could afford all those giant explosions but not some cheap props to use as grenades? At another time, an actor plays dead but you can see him breath. The director could have ordered the camera further back; could have only shown the face; could have made the actor stop breathing and make only short takes. Why keep a shot with a clear mistake in it? It can only be presumed, that just as with the unnatural dialogue, the makers see the message as the important thing and do not care about the details, but that is poor choice because the details do get noticed and they do detract from the realism and therefore from the belief.The film has good sound effects for explosions and gunfire. Interesting choice is that there is no music, apart from what you hear during the credits, but then perhaps music would be antagonistic to the message of the film. The silence and special effects are used to a good effect and do not need music for more dramatisation.All quiet on the western front is a valiant effort, and definitely memorable, but has quite a few flaws. It is well shot and has many cool looking moments, but some of its effects are surprisingly poor. It has good actors but a lack of realism that makes it feel sanitised.",7,0,3,15 December 2014
Sausage Party," Test your friends
","It feels like this movie was designed as a test for the purpose of finding out more about the people you know. Make them watch this movie and then ask them about it afterwards. If someone starts talking about how it's too offensive or doesn't find it at least somewhat funny. Well, that's how you know who you want to hang out with. It is funny to see how the reviews for this movie fluctuate so much, and that is not a coincidence.The plot feels loose. Seems like it was never very important. The makers had a few scenes or dirty jokes they wanted to make and they loosely wrapped them together with a single premise: what if food products didn't know what happens to them after a human buys them. Mostly, this movie is a vulgar racist d*ck joke, and what sells the said d*ck joke is the creative animation and good delivery.The humour is a bit hit and miss, yes, that is true. Mostly it's blunt. The largest part of the entertainment value is in the degree of the vulgarity and bluntness. If you do not think that this extreme can be funny on its own then this is movie is probably not for you (and I'm sorry, but we can't be friends).Is this movie worth watching more than once? No. Is it funny? In the case of this movie, it really depends on your sense of humour.By the way, I don't understand how The Interview got the same score as this movie. Both are Seth Rogan joints, but this can actually be funny and timeless, while that other movie was an dated unfunny pop-culture mess.",8,2,4,14 November 2016
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Deeper and better than may at first appear
","This is an awesome film.I am not sure I will find many words to express this, but this film is really special and plays out in a manner I did not expect it to.Contrary to almost every other World War II movie, there is an uncanny realism and variation to everything, especially the people.This is probably because it is not a movie about the war or being in a prison camp, despite that being the background for it.This movie is about the characters and what drives them. And to show that properly you get some superb acting.I was a bit disappointed by the excessive use of the forever fake-looking day-for-night technique (though it was more day-for-dusk). It must have been a bane of movies back then like CGI is today. Other than that the movie looked pretty good.Nice film, holds up well and so highly recommended.",9,0,1,10 November 2014
Downfall," Surprisingly interesting with so little happening
","You must have heard the synopsis already: The movie takes place during the last few days of the fall of Berlin and concentrates on the people in and around the Hitler's bunker.This is not the most exciting premise, but the setting is no doubt a small treasure chest for drama. Do the makers dig into that treasure chest? Yes, they do. The cast, consisting mostly of actors not well known outside of Germany, does an excellent job with the roles, especially Bruno Ganz as Hitler.Hitler switches between hope, delusion, anger and despair as his staff hopelessly tries to find some clarity and a future in the man who clearly can no longer be of any use to them.The suffering outside the bunker and the ever encroaching action of war are faded into the background to give more attention to the relationship between the largely isolated people inside, who are trying to cling to the system that is no longer there or come to terms with the truth that is upon them.The humanity that these German actors have been able to give to their characters is palpable in each gaze, word and grimace and it is understandable why this movie got so much criticism. Instead of portraying the situation in the Anglo-American politically correct terms and separating the good guys from the bad guys, the makers have instead portrayed everyone as real humans (which I noticed is common in German films). They even ensured a good physical resemblance of the people being portrayed. This is refreshingly sober and reminds of Stalingrad (directed by Joseph Vilsmaier) - another good German war drama. Der Untergang feels like the most realistic portrayal of the situation in question.Unfortunately, I can't say I will remember much about this movie beyond a few of its characters. For many people this will be enough, but for this reviewer the experience of being stuck in a room with a bunch of officers who for several days cannot make up their mind on what to do is...a little pointless.",8,0,2,13 December 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most entertaining films ever
","Leonardo DiCaprio is just getting better and better. This guy is like an oil reservoir that that turns out to be bigger and bigger.Leonardo plays Jordan Belfort, a stock market trader who becomes more and more corrupt as his debauched lifestyle is spiraling out of control and it is exceptionally enjoyable to watch this guy's depraved antics and listen to his commentary.Leonardo definitely makes this movie, but the other players are pretty awesome too. The fat and skittish Jonah Hill is hilarious. Jon Bernthal wears an awesome mustache as one of Leonardo's criminal friends and he is not in the movie nearly enough. Margot Robbie who plays Leonadro's new wife is actually a good actress and there is depth to her character but it looks like the movie is well aware of what her role is in this movie: eye candy.The writing is absolutely amazing both in terms of humour and the portraying of the selfishness and pride of the main character. The dialogue is pretty good but the humour is in the acting and the visual presentation rather than just jokes.This movie looks good, in part due to all the sides of the rich life, including all the boobs, but also due to how the scenes are structured, the cuts and flash backs.The crazy does get a little old. This movie has many inventive and fun looking scenes, but the over-saturated gang-bang drug-induced scenes get old after the third time you see them and lose their effect. Also, seeing how much drugs the main character takes, it is clear that this film takes creative license with the realities of drug abuse.I do not have a whole lot to say about this film because I was having too much fun watching Leonardo Di'Caprio chew this movie to analyze the details. Wolf of Wall Street is one of the most entertaining films ever.",8,0,3,3 January 2015
Hancock," Weird...good weird or bad weird? Up to you
","Either the directors or the script writers must've been high when they were creating this one. I wish to be able to fill the ten lines that are required for submitting a review, but after that first line, anything else seems to be redundant.Throughout the movie one has to mentally ask himself 'what?' several times. Perhaps if you put the story on paper it wouldn't read too bad, but the execution thereof seems to be a little trickier. A question arises whether some scenes and lines were really necessary. Surely there's something more useful to be said and shown at that time. The plot is not complicated but nonetheless twisted, and at every turn the inertia wants you to go one way, but the movie has already decided to go the other. Because of all the turns even the acting of the high rollers comes under strain.Perhaps it would have been wise to split the movie in two and make two separate parts, with the first one only concentrating on Hancock's journey from a bum to a superhero. It would've been a good movie and much easier to stomach.In any case, what no one can take away from Hancock is that it's a fresh drink of water in the long line of cliché superhero formulas. It's hard to predict what happens next. And with that freshness you still get a good amount of laughs and special effects.",6,3,5,24 September 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Good looking and well acted mess
","There are a number of aspects in any movie and all of those aspects have to be at a certain level in order to make a good film. One important component fails and the movie fails. In the Hobbit 3 the acting is professional and the visuals have been polished to sparkle but it is the poor lazy writing concealed beneath the flashy outside that fails.Obviously the movie is not welcoming to new-comers. You have to have seen the previous Hobbit movies to understand this one (and frankly you have to see the Lord of the Rings movies in order to appreciate The Hobbit movies). People do not seem to mind and that is fine, but in that case I want one movie ticket for all of The Hobbit movies, please. If I paid to see a movie, I would like to walk out of The Hobbit 2 and go into The Hobbit 3 with the same ticket because it is the same movie.Not only is the Hobbit 3 simply a foundationless continuation of the last movie, but it feels like the ending to the Hobbit 2 that has been cut off and stretched out into a full film because rich directors need to eat too, I suppose.The plot revolves around the dwarfs being hauled up in their recaptured mountain fortress full of riches as several parties of Middle Earth converge on the mountain, while the dwarf king has to deal with an onset of madness. However, do not take the word 'plot' to heart because there isn't really a plot here. There isn't an original solid story that can stand on its own.The main premise is that the king becomes greedy as he desperately seeks the jewel Arkenstone and wants to protect his gold. If it sounds familiar it is because it is the same bloody premise as in the Lord of the Rings! A desirable macguffin 'insert item name here' that corrupts you. Why did the story need to be recycled? The script feels bloated. A fight happens, and another two fights are happening at the same time. They keep on happening and happening, and the fight will seemingly come to a conclusion, but no, it changes gear and we are back in the same fight again but from a different angle. As was the case with the Lord of the Rings, the movie refuses to end on moments that feel more than appropriate to end on, except unlike Lord of the Rings the movie is not nearly good enough to outstay its welcome like that.The eagles! Let us talk about those friggin eagles. When the giant eagles first appeared in Lord of the Rings helping a hero out of a corner, like the very definition of 'deus ex machina', it could have been forgiven or perhaps even explained, but after the mistake was pointed out and made fun of by the public Jackson continued to put those eagles into the story. He is insulting the viewer's intelligence and the viewer is letting him.But I am glad the eagles were added to this movie because it gives a perfect example of what is wrong with the story of this film: stuff just happens. It does not feel like there is one single thread of events connected by reason but rather several loosely connected cgi scenes.There is no logic for the mind to grasp because you know that in this cgi-fest physics need not apply and anything could happen for no particular reason because the makers can write anything and animate anything to fill out the movie, and so they do.Imagine if instead of a song that has a specific mood, an intro, a chorus, verses and an outro what you got was a solo played by a robot consisting of just running up and down the scale really fast, then a few random chords from the scale, then another solo and everything is played dramatically. Yes, it may all be in the same key, but it is still sh*t.Plot lines are left open. Something happens to one of the main characters that completely changes his behavior from then on and it is never explained. It just happened, deal with it. The above-mentioned Arkenstone gets completely forgotten towards the 2nd half of the film, and in fact, so does the whole mountain that all the fighting was about.Every character is so cookie-cutter simple. The dialogue in this movie is not all bad but it certainly can take deep dives. People keep narrating what we can see perfectly well by ourselves. If you actually think about what is being said, much of it is drama for drama's sake, empty but epic-sounding over-the-top dialogue sold to the viewer by professional tradesmen that are these actors.The thing that angers me the most is that people eat this movie right up. Mr. Jackson and his team woos the viewers with an expensive magical exterior and earns gazillions of dollars.Maybe it is just that all of the weaknesses of all The Lord of the Rings movies are suddenly reaching me at once. If you enjoy this film, great. In fact, I suspect that boys will like it since it has a lot of action, simple characters and simple events. It is definitely advisable to watch right after the first two films so that its lack of independence is not as jarring.Empty dialogue, ridiculous plot points, abandoned plot points, plot holes and in fact a giant hole where the plot should be. If you respect movies, do not watch this one because it does not respect you back. The Hobbit 3 is a very well shot and well-acted BAD movie.",5,3,8,18 February 2015
Platoon," Holy sh*t....
","This is the most tangible movie I have ever laid my eyes on. I could almost smell the crap from the latrines and the sweat-soaked clothes on the soldiers.It also one of the most tense movies I have seen. It has a lot of quiet times when people are just waiting or walking around and those moments are no less tense than the action filled ones.The action....well it is not really what this movie is about and I have seen better but it is still quite good. You will get your load of explosions.It is hard to talk about the story as there isn't really one. The movie is generally about people's characters coming out over the course of their time in the Vietnam war and the way those characters change, interact and clash.To make that non-story story work, there is whole star cast. Willem Dafoe and Tom Berenger are the two strongest roles. Some of the acting can be a little cheesy, but this was probably Tom's best role ever.The only problem I have is with the main protagonist, Charlie Sheen. His acting and his narration feel forced. I am not surprised that he would later start playing in comedy spoofs of action movies because that is how a lot of his acting felt like in this one. I expected him to loose it and suddenly start laughing.Platoon is one of the best if not the best war movies of all time.",9,2,3,24 November 2014
The Deer Hunter," Good atmosphere but rather inefficient
","This film takes a reeeeeeeeeealy long time setting up its atmosphere and characters, an entire first hour in fact and then some. I found many scenes to serve no other purpose but that. The atmosphere is important to the film and it is created well, but the movie may lose your attention a few times in the process. There is not much symbolism or story or tension inserted into all those extra scenes; not much for the mind to chew on.The film is about the life of several people from a blue-collar immigrant community before during and after the Vietnam war.It is a fairly heavy and gloomy film. Even when the characters are laughing and having fun, you feel the sobering weight of their lives. The soundtrack blasts Russian choir in the mountains. There are a lot of twilight and night scenes.The film has one of the better performances from Christopher Walken and John Savage. The latter is a bit boring in the beginning but really stops you in your tracks later in the movie. Robert De Niro shines in the lead role as usual, but that is not a surprise. On the other hand, I think Meryl Streep is much better than given credit to. She has a very natural delivery. Robert de Niro is good but he is still acting. Meryl is like a real human being filmed with a home camera.Deer Hunter has good actors, good acoustic soundtrack, good atmosphere and some strong story moments, but it also has too many empty scenes. It is a bit like really good jam spread too thinly over the bread. If the makers just really wanted for the film to be 3 hours long, they could have concentrated a bit more on the life of those characters left behind in the US during the war, who instead get completely forgotten while the 3 main characters are off at war.Nevertheless, this epic feels solid enough and is worth your time. I personally do not even mind the window dressing because the film still works. It is more of an issue from a technical point of view that could have been avoided.",7,0,1,28 November 2014
The Matrix," Cool looking but highly overrated film
","This movie looks cool.I think I could end the review there. I should end the review there if I want it to stay really positive about the film. That is what this movie is about: its looks.This is a movie that either invented or perfected bullet time, which is actually two effects in one: the effect of bullets flowing through the air in slow motion leaving trails behind them and the filming of an object that is frozen in place by using several still cameras and digital motion compensation. The green computer code (digital rain) has become a signature Matrix effect as well as the effect of showing a 3D image in Matrix code. The black longcoat outfits, which by the way is a look that I had invented for myself long before this movie was created (maybe that is what bothers me the most about it), have become universally associated with that movie. Just say the 'Matrix outfit' and people know.The action is jaw dropping and the acrobatic scenes with guns and martial arts are superbly choreographed.This film can have all the Oscars for its visuals but this can never fix the fact that the story is garbage.Now, the way the events are structured is fine and the movie is actually really good at keeping tension. It is quite mysterious and awesome until the premise is revealed. Everything that happens after that moment and everything that happened before it stops making sense. I do not want to spoil anything, but your enjoyment of the film from that moment on is entirely dependent on your ability to let go of thinking. This ability is granted to many people because of how awesome the visuals and audio presentatoin is, but that persentation eventually ends and common sense kicks you in the head...well, at least it should have.How is the acting? I will tell you when I see more of it, because for most of the movie the characters are walking around with no expressions on their faces and lines are spoken calmly. Isn't that convenient. Not only that, but their eyes, the most expressive part of a human face, are covered with sunglasses. Those f$&*%(g sunglasses, man! All these people are wearing sunglasses when there is no sun...like at night...indoors.This film has indeed entered the depth of popular culture. A near infinite amounts of spoof videos and cartoons have been made and many would call that an ultimate compliment, and to some degree it is a complement, at least a complement to the film's visual presentation.But upon closer examination, I have never heard any of the quotes from this film be used with respect like something from the Godfather movies would be. It is fun to make fun of the film's silly writing.The bottom line is that this film was visually innovative and unique, and because that was its whole gimmick right from the start, it deserves praise. However, the acting and the underlying story in this film are terrible. Additionally, various people started attributing some sort of philosophy to this movie that is not there. There have even been books written on the subject. This makes either the movie or the people doing the attributing very pretentious. I would like to believe it is the latter and that Matrix is a show that is meant to be admired for what it is: a flashy cool action scene.",7,2,7,23 January 2015
Deadpool," Good movie made for fans who can overlook imperfections
","There are many problems with this move, especially if all the jokes that didn't hit are allowed to be counted as separate problems.Look, comedy is hard. Action comedy is especially hard, and Deadpool is a dark comedy comic book hero. It should not be surprising that the movie based on him can be pretty stupid at times. Some jokes are genuinely funny, but a lot of them are just dumb. Of course, if you are the kind of person who thinks, 'So what? Dumb can be good,' then this argument has not much of a leg to stand on.However, while the quality of the humour is in the eye of the beholder, its life expectancy can be judged more harshly because a lot of the humour is pop-culture topical, referencing various celebrities or obscure movies, which means that this movie is not going to be nearly as enjoyable a few years from now. Even now it can be sometimes hard to perceive for those who are not into superhero movies.It is not only the humour but the whole movie feels that way: like it will not be relevant or remembered a couple of years from now. It does things like introduce the X-men academy and characters from the X-men universe without explanation because it expects you to know those things, which in turn makes the movie feel like a stop gap between some two other bigger superhero movies.Then there are some standard superhero movie plot oddities. Why does Deadpool put so much effort in trying to avoid bullets, considering his superpower? How did one of the characters who is not a superhero, manage to survive what should clearly be a fatal fall? Do we really need another 'I got your girl' villain? All of this does not break the movie though because Deadpool is still a good movie, all things considered. I found it to be less enjoyable for the comedy and more for being a pretty good standard super hero movie. The acting is good if you do not mind Ryan Reynolds' delivery; The chemistry between characters is good; The villain is very shallow but surprisingly charismatic; and the action looks cool.Could it be better? Yes, the jokes could be less corny, the camera work during the action could be clearer, the fighting choreography could be less bland and less reliant on CG, some of the plot points could be less cliché, but as it is, Deadpool is still worth a watch, and worth making a sequel to.",7,2,11,14 February 2016
Cube," A different horror movie, but still has horror movie flaws
","Cube is something odd. You can say different things about it, but one thing for sure, it is different from other horror movies that came before it. Oh sure, the idea of putting people into a situation where they start getting killed one by one as they try to find a way to save themselves from a mysterious danger is not new, and there are other horror movie clichÃ©s here too, but there is enough difference to separate this from other horror films.Cube can strike one as both dumb and smart.It is about a group of people stuck inside a deadly puzzle. The way the story is handled in terms of the puzzle progression and the 'solutions' to the puzzle is pretty interesting. The way the characters develop is interesting.However, the dialogue takes a dip in quality. It is not very original and just does not flow very well. It is horror movie writing, that is to say, not good.Visually, the movie is most distinguishable. The whole thing takes place inside the cube puzzle, which looks remarkable and gives the film a most alien look. This must have been money saving as well, because all you really need is 2 cubes and a few colorful lamps to light them.The film also uses some CGI, which is absolutely terrible most of the time, but was probably impressive when this movie first came out.The cameraman has a tendency to use angled or angling close ups of people's faces, which in combination with the bulging eyes of the actor Maurice Dean Wint further contributes to the alien look that this film has.I want to give this film a higher praise but some of the acting and the dialogue was irritating. It is however one of the better horror movies out there and definitely one of the more original looking ones.",6,0,0,6 December 2014
The Thin Red Line," A bit too long and artsy, but has a lot of good
","I think The Thin Red Line is not as good as it believes itself to be. I feel that it believes it is a war movie to end all war movies. It has a message, action, top actors, orchestral music and more than 2.5 hours worth of screen time. Look at it, sitting all puffed up over there.And you know what, to some degree, by virtue of it aiming really high and being confident, it does achieve some level of quality.For one, it looks good. One of the recurring themes of the movie is the glory of nature's world compared to the smallness of men's world and you get to see some pretty scenery in the pacific, sometimes in slow motion...in high def and wide screen.As already mentioned, it has a good cast too. Nick Nolte, Sean Penn, Woody Harrelson, Cusack, Chaplin, Travolta, Cloony. Can't spit without hitting a star. And the stars do what they are good at. No bad performances in this movie that I can think of. In fact, we did not need all these guys to make the movie good. This is where it starts to try too hard.Unfortunately, in its arrogance it gets a little too far up its own behind and becomes boring and pretentious.There is a lot poetic prose being narrated by various soldiers during the slower moments. Now, I know there are going to be people out there praising this narration even though I also know they probably do not understand it.These slower moments of reflection do serve a good cause. They put you into a trance so that when something actually happens, it makes a bigger splash. It is like quieter moments in music to contrast with the louder ones. However, some of them drag on for longer than needed. I found my mind wondering off a few times. And the poetic stuff works sometimes but sometimes comes off as preachy and pretentious.The Thin Red Line is a movie that tries too hard, but that does not stop it from being good. It is just a shame that you could cut an hour of this movie and it would not lose much. After the movie ended I felt sleepy, and it was not because it drained me with its intense action, I can tell you that for sure.",7,4,7,21 November 2014
Her," Beautiful and well acted but kind of empty
","I'm going to start with my main problem with this film. This problem will probably not bother that many people as it is specific to my character, but... This film is about a man starting a relationship with a fully humanised artificial intelligence and I did not believe in it one bit. If I cannot believe in something that is central to a film then that pretty much ruins it for me.In 2001 A Space Odyssey I believed in the artificial intelligence called HAL and I still do. For a time of interstellar travel HAL's vocal expression and capabilities seemed appropriate. However, in Her we are clearly presented with a not too distant future and we are supposed to believe that in that not too distant future people will have an OS that is so fluent in all human emotions and communication capabilities that it acts and sounds just like. I'm sorry, no. Certains scenes of interaction between the AI and the main character just outright made me laugh because it seemed so ridiculous.I mean it is just Scarlett Johansson talking to Joaquin Phoenix off-screen. They ask the audience to pretend that the voice is coming from the AI. This is just lazy to me. I know that this complaint is not important in view of the general message(s) of this movie, but it is still too central to ignore.The movie is probably the most beautiful one I have ever seen, at least in recent memory. It has this light and bright style that makes you want to breath it in like fresh air. The camera often uses narrow depth of field with a gorgeous bokeh effect in the background. Great shots and color, which...unfortunately kept making me think that I was watching a commercial for a phone or a camera. I guess that says more about the style of those commercials than about this movie, but I thought I'd mention it.In terms of the acting, this is very much a movie of Joaquin Phoenix's face (as the poster suggests). There are a lot of up-close shots and the answer to whether or not Joaquin can carry an entire movie centered on his character from up-close is of course yes. This actor was made for emotional roles like this one and has proved himself in the past.I cannot praise this film as much as some critics did. The movie clocks at over 2 hours and not much happens during that time. It is a loose deliberation on love but not much else, but the cinematography is awesome.",7,2,5,28 June 2014
The Nice Guys," Nice, guys
","The Nice Guys is a pilot episode to a good 90's TV show that never happened. It's also the Thursday evening 90's action movie, which you watch in parts as you flip between the channels on your TV because you can't decide if you want to watch this movie, the show on National Geographic or The Peacekeeper that's just starting.It is a polished buddy cop action movie with excellent performances from most actors. The little girl who plays the daughter of one of the detectives is adorable. The costumes look good. The camera work is clean, without shaky cam, and the action is appropriately dumb, as it tries to imitate the bad action movies of the 80s and 90s. However, beyond the basic quality, there is not much to this movie. There is no major depth to any of the characters; there is no central respectable bad guy; the script is not that smart (appropriately of course, as far as 90's action movies go); and there is no big twist. The story is a murder investigation.I liked the film and I want to see more of these guys. It's time for a good buddy-cop show. But as a one-off, this is somewhat unremarkable.",7,0,1,8 July 2017
Gladiator," A very solid movie all-round
","What is cool about Gladiator (besides a whole lot of things) is that it should not offend pro- or anti-Romans. There have been a number of big movies, almost since the beginning of movies, that put Rome into the evil category. This choice echoes from the popular anti-Imperial culture of the 20th and 21st century that favors freedom over unity and order. Sorry, I will stop if that sounds preachy, but the point is: Gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals.Gladiator is not the most historically accurate film. After all, they put a whole lot of story conveniently into the events for which there are very few sources for reference. And of course the armor is not going to be perfectly accurate, and of course everything is pumped up. But it actually does a great deal right and looks genuine. The politics get smart toward the middle of the film. This film has depth, though it is not hard to understand.Disguised under all the pomp and depth there is hidden a fairly typical formula for an action movie with a good and a bad guy, a family member in danger, a personal loss, a cheesy honor speech, and of course a mano-a-mano fight, but it is hidden and packaged very well.Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus is not the protagonist but is arguably the main character of the film. The 'evil' in his character is so refined, deep, believable and even relatable. The cowardice is palpable. He feels like a complex character that creates a good contrast to Russel Crowe's Gladiator, the simpleton soldier with his honor, love and anger issues. Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner was also really good and expressive.The camera work is excellent. The busy sets are filled with good lighting and shots are properly populated, with good atmosphere from all the various fires, mist and snow. Computer generated effects are unfortunately used quite a bit, as the makers would have had a hard time showing the Roman scale without it and yes, some of these effects look dated, but those shots are not shown for long and overall it works.The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is actually not the best if you listen to it on its own but works really well in this movie, especially in battles. It brings the necessary gravity to everything. Speaking of listening to the soundtrack on its own, do try 'The Might of Rome' when visiting a large city - awesome. Lisa Gerrard brought her voice which is a great recognizable emotional deep contralto, though her main presence in this movie is saved for the credits.The movie is totally rewatchable, and in fact, the second time may reveal many new nuances in the dialogue you may have missed the first time, especially if you are watching the extended addition (which you should). As time passed after its release, this movie was increasingly becoming a hype. Internet memes were being made from it. People kept asking me to make Maximus' armor for a game. This plebeian hype made me increasingly dislike this film by extension, but the fact is that this is a very well-made enjoyable movie.",9,1,2,31 January 2015
Born on the Fourth of July," Well structured but rather cheesy anti-war movie
","Born on the Fourth of July is one of the more cheesier movies out there. In the beginning there is a line a mother says to her boy with a crazy smile as they are watching TV: 'I had a dream, Ronnie, the other night, that you were speaking to a large crowd just like himjust like him, and you were saying great things'! And in the background a wondrous orchestral theme is playing. Now that particular line does pay off eventually, but large parts of the movie are like that: artificial and full of pomp and cheese, all for the sake of the message.That music keeps on coming back and it is always either the adventurous tune from every children's adventure movie ever or else the saddest tragedy tune. It really affects the mood of the movie and is one of the few movie scores that is persistently noticeable. This music on its own is good but in the film it is a major contributor to that cheesy feeling as it helps push the anti-war meaning.It is as if a hippie tried to do an anti-war movie and tried to stay respectful and tasteful. He thinks he is but he still can't help but push his point through in every scene.This brings me to another issue related to its pushy point: the issue with content variety. Of course a movie should have a point, but everything in this movie is about 'war is bad'. We see the young hero of the film being a promising young man and the rest of the film we spend watching the negative effects of war on him. Almost everything is related to that. Just pick a scene. Is war still bad? Yup, it is still bad. And how about this scene, what is the mood of this scene? War is bad. Even in the beginning, before the main character experiences war, the obvious music and themes remind you that war will be bad. It is only towards the end of the movie that something more positive and meaningful starts coming through but this is a long movie and you have to wait a while for that pay-off.This movie makes me appreciate The Thin Red Line more. That is another movie with an anti-war message but it is much more subtle. Born on the Fourth of July, just like its title, is not.Having said that, there is a point and a good structure to support it. Things seeded earlier in the story grow fruits later on. The progression in the main character and the change in his beliefs feels realistic and well-spread over the course of the film. There is also a good side to the movie being obvious, namely that it is clear and easy to grasp. Raw and dirty scenes may be forced in the viewer's face, but on the other hand the movie has interesting raw and dirty scenes that give the film texture.On top of that, the movie has a good cast of many familiar faces appearing in different parts of the film. Tom Cruise in the main role gives it his best as he usually does. It would have been cooler if Willem Dafoe stayed for longer in the movie than he did but maybe then he would have chewed the scenery too much and outweigh the film.Generally, the movie seems to get better as it progresses because the good structure starts becoming more and more apparent and the ideas start paying off, but I wish it was not so pushy.",7,1,2,17 July 2015
Princess Mononoke," A great epic with a few loose ends
","Princes Mononoke is one of Hayao Miyazaki's high profile creations relatively well known in the West, which is not surprising considering its reserved adult tone and the down-to-earth ecological themes that should resonate with the Western audiences. Still, it is a complex epic with a high artistic level and it has a knack for holding the viewer's attention from start till finish.The film tells a story of a conflict between the forest Gods and humans into which the human protagonist is pulled as he comes searching for a cure for his worsening affliction. Although, it has a hippie tint to it, the story is not forcing any opinions and the characters are realistic with appealing personalities.The Japanese acting and its English dubbing are both notable. The makers tried to ensure a high quality conversion into English and even the songs are beautifully sung in English by Sasha Lazard. The English acting however isstrange. A lot of it is bizarrely devoid of emotion, far more than the original material, which is already relatively tame by Japanese animation standards. This is especially true for the main hero's dialogue.This detached English performance keeps coming back throughout the film in various characters and therefore seems to be intentional but it does not appear to be in key with the tone of the movie and, at some points, sounds out of sync with the emotions being portrayed by the characters' faces. As mentioned, the Japanese performance can also be very calm at times, but that calmness serves a purpose to underline someone's character or a particular situation and feels appropriate. The English monotony often does not.With some of the characters the English dub does feel weightier, most notably with the animals, but despite the efforts of such notables as Gillian Anderson the Japanese version still feels far superior.The personalities are all interesting, but the main character is a little unreal. He is a young person who is introduced to a new environment, but whenever it suits the movie, he somehow knows what is going on and what to do, with copious amounts of confidence and better than the characters who have been living at the location for a long time. It feels like the animators cut a few corners with his character not to make the already long movie even longer.The animation is awesome. Myazako is really all about that word, 'animation'. Everything feels alive. This life comes from a high attention to detail. Small and sometimes subtle movements breathe life into the side characters, some of whom will only occupy the screen for a few seconds , but they pass that life on to the rest of the film. These little imaginative details keep the viewer interested and drawn in.The high budget for the film shows in these details and in the fluidity of the animation. There are noticeably many frames of animation, not all the time but there where it matters. The visual transitions are also great, like the change from dry to rainy weather or from living to dead plants. These are made especially effective by sparing use of colour. Bright saturated colour in this film appears to be used primarily for contrast to indicate life or magic.The orchestral soundtrack complements the mood well most of the time, with an occasional recurrence of minimalistic taiko drums for extra contrast. I did notice a few scenes where the mellow music did not fit in with the action, but I know this is more to do with the Japanese cultural outlook on such type of action scenes.What is really good with both the music and other sound effects is that they are used sparingly and stop when appropriate. The lack of sound is used very effectively.If there is one point of contention it is the ending. It feels rushed. Once the movie comes to its conclusion you might realise that the motivations of different characters have not been fully explained. Considering how major the decisions they make are, it would really help to explain things in more detail. The last few events in the film and their consequences are also unclear. At this point the dialogue starts going off the track as well. One of the characters who failed at what he tried to achieve just happily accepts the outcome. The main hero starts uttering empty pretentiousness. Yet another character is just forgotten. Most of the issues the characters had do not get resolved. No lessons learned. The last few minutes of the film just feel mangled up and cut short.I feel the memory of this film in the fans may be a tad rose-coloured, but apart from a few story issues, Princess Mononoke is one of the greatest things you can see on the screen. The interesting details and good contrast in sound and visuals keep the viewer engaged. I want to say this film is what Ferngully should have been, but I feel like I am insulting Princess Mononoke by putting those two in the same sentence.",8,0,1,21 December 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," A recipe that is messed up on a few crucial points
","If your expectation when going to see this movie is to meet a relative of Hannibal Lector, the calm and all knowing master, you will be somewhat disappointed.Law Abiding Citizen is a concept that just begs to speak to the primal feeling of hatred within many of us towards the big bad government man. In this instance it is one angry mastermind whom we get to see take it out on the system. You could do much with this concept. You do need some intelligent complexity to tickle the viewer's brain throughout such a film, but the base for success is already there. Sadly, this one got messed up.The story is has a few unpredictable turns, but unpredictable is not a good thing if the twists and turns do not lead to anything satisfying. The makers do not go through with the whole genius-criminal concept like, for example, in Silence of the Lambs or Saw. Neither do they go through with a brilliant-detective concept. The movie ends up being somewhere in the middle or nowhere at all and the ending ends up being a total letdown.The talking doesn't make things any better. Most of the dialogue between the two main characters, the district attorney and the angry guy, could be taken away and it would make no difference whatsoever. The two are talking intensely, and you may for a while think that you do not understand whose point is more just and what that point is, but do not worry - if you're not understanding it's because there is no clear point, moral or other - just English words said in a thrilled tone and repeated at the next encounter. This is why, although the acting presented is solid, the characters are a little dead, and they make the story a little dead, which in turn makes the movie a little dead. I remember Hannibal Lector, I remember Norman Bates, but I already forgot the the name of the bad guy from this movie.If the characters aren't particularly interesting then you tend to look for something else. So what else is there? This is a thriller with not many special effects, so the action is not the center piece. The thrills do work, even if due to the viewer's confusion rather than anything else. Also, one result of the shallow main characters is that the rest of the cast gets more spotlight, which they take gracefully.Law Abiding Citizen is not bad - it's bi-curious. It doesn't quite know what it wants to be. In a way, that fact mixed with a healthy dose of violence keeps you closer to the edge of your chair. However, the expectation for a satisfying (or unsatisfying) release never gets justified – the pretty silver bowl is empty.",6,0,0,5 February 2010
