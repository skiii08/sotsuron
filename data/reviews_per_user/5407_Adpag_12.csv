Minority Report," Chronic
","An interesting story, for which credit goes to Mr Dick, but the main flaw for me was the running time. It just seemed to go on and on. And on. And at times it just looked a little too contrived, as if the production designers wanted to fit in too much gimmickry. I can't see Cruise and co 'conducting' images by waving their hands all over the place, and waiting for wooden balls to be etched, when the same effect could have been achieved more efficiently by a mouse and a monitor. That may sound trivial, but the need for speed is clearly demonstrated in the opening sequence where a crime of passion is prevented by a mere second.That said, it isn't too bad on the whole - it should have been much better though, given the heavyweight talented involved.",Null,0,0,3 January 2003
Hotel Rwanda," So-so
","It seems that the more shocking and tragic the events that a film is based on, the easier it is to go completely gaga and convince yourself that the film is good.This film isn't bad. The events it portrays truly are a black mark in the history books, and it does well in not sensationalising what happened. On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened. Consequently there was virtually no dramatic impact in it for me. As I said, it wasn't bad - neither was it particularly good. The script and acting were acceptable, but I wouldn't give it any more praise than that.",5,5,12,22 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Attack of Director Sitting on Laurels
","When I first saw this on theatrical release I thought yes, it's better that Phantom Menace, perhaps it's a return to form. A second viewing on DVD soon changed that. I wanted it to be up to the standard of the original trilogy, but sadly it isn't. Take out Yoda's finest moment and there's precious little left.The script is poor - hard to believe that there are big-budget films from respected directors that still have the lines 'i've got a bad feeling about this'. The special effects are (mostly) as good as you'd expect but since you can see brilliant effects in a typical 20-second TV commercial these days, that isn't enough. The acting is variable - Ewan MacGregor is a fine actor but in this, as in Episode 1, he is just miscast and wooden. But perhaps the real kiss of death is Hayden Christensen as Anakin. The character is supposed to be undergoing the inner turmoil that will eventually see him turning to the dark side, but he comes across as a whining teenage brat who'd be more at home in a TV soap. I never thought I'd find myself doing this in a Star Wars film, but in the 'getting it on' scenes between him and Portman, I had to fast forward. I just couldn't stand it.And finally - I may be missing something fundamental, but I cannot help but wonder why none of the clones actually look like the original they were cloned from. Give up now George, or at least hand over the reins to somebody else for Episode 3.",Null,0,1,27 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Virtually spot-on
","This film has had a ridiculous amount of superlatives heaped upon it, and for once they are justified. You don't need to have read the books to enjoy it, but it helps. With such a landmark source material, everyone is going to have their own idea of what it should look like, and I think Peter Jackson and his crew must have read my mind.Like many, I am sure, I had misgivings when I heard of the project. Too often a good book is translated to screen and ruined in the process, and in these days of over-reliance on computer FX that feat is even easier to accomplish. This is not the case here; although it could not really have been attempted without the technical wizardry available today, the effects never look 'tacked on' and blend comfortably with the natural location filming.The casting was inspired - a few well-known actors, but no huge star names to potentially sink the project. In fact the performances in general were far better than one could rightfully expect in what is, on one level, basically a fairy story. If I had to pick one for special note it would have to be Ian McKellen as Gandalf; he is one of the best stage and film actors alive today, period, and there are moments of sheer brilliance - in fact if I had to pick a single moment from the film it would be the look on Gandalf's face when, at the council of Elrond, Frodo volunteers to take the ring to Mordor. I don't think I've ever seen such a mix of emotions put into a single expression, and the impact of that one shot is absolutely tremendous.If I have one criticism, it's that I felt the sequence in Lothlorien seemed too short, but given the running time of the theatrical release it's understandable - there is simply too much to fit in. The DVD extended edition has additional footage here and, for me, it was much better. In fact all the additional footage added to the experience, rather than merely being padding. We can only be thankful that Jackson resisted pressure to condense the whole trilogy into one film, and I get the feeling that, excellent though this is, things are going to get better.",Null,0,0,4 January 2003
Armageddon," Armageddin' out of this cinema
","Being a big movie fan, I'll even watch bad ones...but I came the closest I've ever come to walking out when I paid to see this one.The trailer had me drooling - yes, even after thirty years of cinema-going I'm still taken in. When I saw the finished product I realised why the trailer looked good; it had no dialogue in it. There's a fine line between a good no-brainer action film, and a film that requires a lobotomy before viewing. Guess which side of the line this one falls on.",Null,1,3,31 December 2002
Spirited Away," Masterpiece
","(Original subtitled version reviewed)Proof, as though it were needed, that the far-and-away best animators are in Japan. This is a magical story, and a true family film; and by that I don't mean a sickly-sweet singalong, which is what Disney would have produced.I'm a recent convert to Japanese animation, for the same reason (ignorance) that still turns many people off it. For too long I thought that anime films were full of rampaging robots and huge masses of tentacles bent on nothing but rape and destruction. Admittedly there are plenty like that (some of them good) but there's much more to the genre. I've since discovered that anything from Miyazaki's Studio Ghibli leaves most other animated films way behind, and this, the most recent, is probably the best.",Null,0,1,3 January 2003
Pearl Harbor," I hope Rolf Harris got the royalties
","I've been waiting for years for someone to make a movie based on the Rolf Harris song 'Two Little Boys'. Actually, I haven't at all - but this is what this rubbish is. Of course it's spectacular, with an inflated budget frittered on this historical event, you know it's not going to be anything else... and unfortunately, it isn't any thing else.Admittedly the biggest box-office receipts for Hollywood product come from home ground, but please - scenes in which American actors (and in this case one of the cheesiest) weep over the Stars and Stripes are impossible to swallow for the rest of the world.",Null,0,1,31 December 2002
Resident Evil," Will they ever learn?
","I cannot understand why film makers take a source material that they think will make a good film, then take out everything that made it good in the first place. For the uninitiated, the original RE video game was a smash hit because it featured, for the most part, a lone character in a genuinely spooky mansion never knowing what unspeakable horror was round the next corner; it also had creepily atmospheric music and unfortunate voice acting. Sadly, the only element that has been retained for the film version is the last.Writer-director Anderson must take the blame, and one can only assume that a) he never actually saw the game; and b) he is so out of touch that he thinks if you like video games and horror, you must be a young, male, heavy metal fan. This mess begins and ends with lame attempts to have a not particularly talented supermodel appear on screen wearing as few clothes as possible. In between is the aforementioned metal cacophony, bad acting and uninspiring special effects. The tension that brought the game to life is completely lacking; the action is rarely involving; and the (very) occasional shock is not enough to compensate for the unintentional hilarity of Jovovich, clad in a fashion disaster, turning into an acrobat and wrenching zombie necks with her thighs.The scariest thing about it is that the sequel, as far as I know, is already in production - but if you avoid the bargain bins at your local rental outlet, you may be lucky and miss it altogether.",Null,0,0,21 December 2002
Meet the Fockers," As funny as cancer
","I never thought I'd see the day when the words 'Robert De Niro' would guarantee one thing only - you are about to watch a bad movie. To be fair though, the blame is not really his. Meet the Parents had the occasional funny part, and they were all in the trailer.Humour is completely absent from this. I wasn't expecting much, and was still gravely disappointed. Everyone in the cast deserves better material. The sight of De Niro in a strap-on breast feeding device is a truly sad sight and an indication of how low his career has sunk. The only unfunnier things on display here are Hoffman and Streisand. Their characters are simply embarrassing. I admit to being unable to watch the whole film, so if it picked up towards the end I would give it more than one point. But it was the longest 54 minutes of my life.",1,4,5,23 June 2005
Driven," Change one letter for a 1-word review...
",...and you get drivel.Truly abysmal. Fails on every single level. Never has motor racing been portrayed as such a deadly dull sport. The script and characters are so wafer-thin as to be non-existent; the direction and editing make the racing look as much fun as a terminal disease; to describe the soundtrack as a tinny racket would be uncharitable to tinny rackets worldwide; the special effects are hilarious (you will laugh out loud at some of the crashes and racing manoeuvres); and ultimately it will only be remembered as the film that inflicted the unearthly monstrosity that is Burt Reynolds' latest facelift on the undeserving world.,Null,1,2,12 July 2002
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," Believe (most of) the hype
","I didn't find Hedwig as hysterically funny as most of the reviews I'd read had led me to believe it was, but it is bitingly funny none the less. It's gritty, emotional (in a real rather than sentimental sense) and peppered with moments of wicked humour courtesy of the ongoing narration by the central character, a virtual one-man tour de force by John Cameron Mitchell. Although the music is essential to the story I did find that there was perhaps too much of it  but this could be because much of it is (presumably intentionally) awful.Destined to be a late-night favourite at cult screenings, partly because of the singalong nature of the songs, with lyrics appearing on screen at one point. Fans of the Rocky Horror Picture Show will lap it up, but you don't have to like that overrated, odious piece of celluloid claptrap to enjoy the fabulous Hedwig.",Null,0,1,10 September 2002
The Great Raid," Dull
","One of the dullest films I've seen in some time. There is no single thing to recommend it. The script is uninspiring; the cast range from the adequate (Fiennes, Csokas)) through the bad (Franco, Nielsen) to the truly atrocious (Bratt, giving a performance of such stupendous badness it's difficult not to fall asleep when he opens his mouth). The director would appear to have done nothing more than say 'okay, stand there and say your lines'. It does liven up when the 'great raid' actually occurs, but that is over 90 minutes in. The music is the generic, ponderous drone you would expect to hear on this type of flag-waver.A chore to watch, and it's a shame that the events that inspired it weren't better represented.",2,3,10,18 August 2006
