The Lobster," Obviously polarising
","It's interesting to read the wildly differing reviews. There's no doubt it's a challenging film, but it's definitely worth watching, if only for the remarkable cast. It's a very absurd but oddly accurate reflection on how society views relationships. There are also some wonderful lines, such as : 'if you find yourself arguing a lot, then children will be assigned to you' and 'There's blood and biscuits everywhere'.It left me thinking for a long time. I have a friend that had a series of failed, rapid relationships but when she started a relationship with a rugby player she complained that she'd have to learn about rugby. I remember pointing out to her that she always changed and attempted to fit into boyfriends ideas of their perfect woman, but she was adamant that this was the route to a perfect relationship. I also have family members that have had children in a vein attempt to save their marriage. I think it's a perfect film",8,3,4,20 December 2019
Jojo Rabbit," Beautiful reflection on today's issues
","I am an ardent fan of anyone who is prepared to hold a mirror up to racism, cruelty and persecution and harpoon these subjects with humour and ridicule. There is a rise in incidents of racism and intolerance and the president has raised the 'respectability' of such behaviour. Jojo rabbit challenges so much of this using a gentle and absurdist satire. I know some critics think it doesn't go far enough, as in with The Producers (springtime for hitler), but I feel it does make some highly relevant points. Johanson is a joy as jojos courageous and resilient mother trying to show her son a different path than the hitler worshipping blind faith that jojo exhibits. The relationship between jojo and his best friend is incredibly sweet and touching, but it's jojos relationship with his imaginary friend hitler that is hilarious and at times difficult to watch, but provides some simple but compelling messages. It's definitely worth watching.",8,0,1,4 January 2020
