E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," re: One of the Films of the 1980's
","Possibly the only other film film apart from this to make me shed tears at a Cinema was the 'Green Mile'. This is an excellent film that can be watched by everyone, or anyone. It even better for those that expected to be given to watch a typical a sci-fi movie. Many people who 'hate' sci-fi movies will get the shock of their lives after seeing this.The genuine 'Love' for ET by the Children, at times seems as if they were not acting, but it was for real.One of the films of the 1980's.I recently watched another Sci-Fi classic recently. Its called 'The Day the Earth Stood still'; and once again it shows that Sci-fi movies can go beyond their 'special effects and blast them high' approach. Films such as these show true emotions; or mainly just make us think that much deeper on how to live our lives.One of the great films of my generation. Yet people will not give credit to films like this, or the Green Mile. These films should be in the top 50 films for all time. Not struggling to get in there!A film that will make you smile, cry and the smile again.A must watch film, if you haven't seen it. And if you have, Watch it again soon.... And then marvel how good it was/is.",10,2,4,19 August 2006
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," re: Can we see in the follow up to this film - Darth Maul?
","Just recently finished watching Rogue one. And I have to say it was not bad. Not bad at all. Took its time to get going with the introductions of the characters as such. But once it did - we had a good film on its hand....(Spoiler Alert - if you are going to read further into this post!!)Loved the inception of Tarkin and Princess Lea in the film - well done!However, I wondered if we are going to move on with this - if we could see the build up of Darth Maul in his earlier days etc, in regards to his meanings to the Star Wars Story... Maybe he meets up with Vadar etc, etc along the way.????Would anyone else like to see more of Darth Maul?????",9,6,13,16 December 2016
Spider-Man 2," re: Near Perfect
","I have only just watch this movie. And its one of those movies that makes you look at yourself. Its thats good. The Cgi effects aren't over the top, its well integrated within this movie. I like this movie better then the first movie, as the story is even stronger.It gave us the chance to see what being a superhero really must be like. Everything is put on hold for Spiderman.I think Spiderman is the real reason why Marvel Comics enjoyed so much success. But I still like the X-men.The are different plots and lines within the movie that make it worth while watching throughout the film.Mary Jane - and her agonising choice between her choice and Peter Parker.Peter Parker and his relationship with his boss, Mr Jonah Jameson.The flash back conversation between Peter Parker and his Uncle.His relationship between Peter Parker and his best friend.A real good movie, that really shows how Peter Parker came over many of the hurdles mentioned above.The action is first class as well. I think that the best shots are still with him Webslinging his way throughout New York. It looks fantastic.Please let have Spiderman 8. Please don't finish off this wonderful Superhero character....If you read the stories of Spiderman you will realise that he has many, many stories that can be used......If you are reading this Hollywood take note.This is one of the finest Superhero movies ever made. Well Done Hollywood.Carl Brown - Ipswich, England carl@garage-music.com",10,4,5,7 October 2005
I Am Legend," re: Not a bad movie ..indeed
","I feel that Will Smith did a great job here with his character. He looked the part. He made you feel at times what it would like to be alone - supposedly in New York.I just wish the script writers could have been more bolder. For instance when they introduced Anna and her child to the plot. Maybe the could have written into the story a flash back of how she survived. And how she came to save Robert Neville, when he was about to lose his life.Maybe, they could have written into the plot things like. The stench of the place. All those dead bodies, bad food going off, etc....They could have made it even more realistic by showing us eve more New Reels. People fighting for petrol. People fighting each other maybe to be allowed to go into home made bunkers, etc, etc. So don't blame Will Smith for their mistakes on that score. OK? Also I felt that the film could have been made longer. 1 X Hour and 40 minutes is far too short for a film like this. Scriptwriters come on! I still would love to see a Sequel to this film. I still think that we haven't seen the best of this film. A sequel might quench our thirst.After all that though. The film had breath taking views of New York. Also I loved the 'Fear' that Will Smith showed when he went after the dog that was chasing the deer into that building.I like the fact that Will Smith, lost it when he was re-quoting the entire scene of Sherk. 'You not very good with people now are you?' , says Anna, when she see's Will losing it.I liked the deer scene at the start of the movie. Looking for fresh meat! Great add to the story. Also the fact that we got shown that he was guzamped by the Lion.He's about to shot the deer himself, and yet the Lion got there first!I liked this movie. It was a lot better movie then a lot that came out in 2007, I can tell you. Just sit back and think, and I am sure that you will agree with that.",9,1,3,29 December 2007
Man on Fire," re: Excellent movie
","I am not really a fan of Modern day movies. However, I loved this film. I especially liked the characters - Denzel Washington as Creasy Dakota Fanning as Pita. Radha Mitchell as Lisa also deserves special praises as well.The characters mentioned above seemed to play against each other so well. It would have been even better if they would have allowed a 'Love interest' to develop between 'Creasey and Lisa' to even make the character have an even more emotional tie in with Pita.This film reminded me of one the greatest movies ever made. And that is 'Shane', that starred Alan Ladd. I believe it was made in 1953. But this movie is much more violent and upto date so to speak.The character chemistry between Denzel Washington as Creasy Dakota Fanning as Pita is wonderful, and even more lines and scenes between them should have been allowed.This film started slowly, but boy it did it build. In the end 'Rooting' for the leading character (* Then you know you have a good movie!)In older style movies you used to get this all the time. Or am I looking at things with rose speckled glasses?????Brilliant movie, and on that will become touted a classic in years to come. Trust me. If you can't get by the violent parts of the film. You see what I mean...Boy can Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning 'act'..One that you should have in your DVD collection. Trust me its good...Do you agree???Carl Brown Ipswich, England",10,1,3,20 November 2005
The Green Mile," re: Wonderful Film - that is always talked about even to this day!
","A truly wonderful Film. Its on par with another classic - The Shawshank Redemption.I just can't believe how this is not in the top ten movies of this website.Please, please, please consider making a Green Mile 2.. please! It gives any one an Understanding how we humans can be so cruel to each other. Then so loving to each other the next.Everyone who sees this movie will never forget it. All the characters are memorable. Even down to the mouse! But John Coffrey character is so good that it will be remembered as one of Hollywoods greatest ever characters. On par with characters such as -'The man with No name', 'The Terminator', 'Darth Vader', 'Cool Hand Luke', 'Atticus Finch', 'Dirty Harry', 'Forrest Grump', etc ,etc you get my drift....Carl Brown - Ipswich, England carl@garage-music.com",10,0,1,17 March 2005
