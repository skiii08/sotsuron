Blade Runner 2049," A masterclass on how to honour a classic movie
","Arrival was my favourite movie last year, now this: Dennis Villeneuve became one of the best active directors in my opinion (with Danny Boyle, PT Anderson, Christopher Nolan).The casting on this movie is just perfect, especially when it comes to the women, such strong characters. Ana de Armas, on this, rivals Gal Gadot as the most beautiful human face in cinema right now.If you have big expectations for this, don't worry: they will be fulfilled.",10,3,12,5 October 2017
