Iron Man 3," Only True Fans Will Understand, Shane
","May or may not contain spoilers.Overall, I thought it was brilliantly made, but only the ones that have followed Iron Man since early in the comics will understand the hidden messages encountered.For example, who would have thought about the shrapnel-necklace he gave to Pepper in the end?Who would have thought about Yinsen's importance in the opening-scene? Who would have thought about the Chinese doctor mentioned in the first Iron Man movie later appeared in this one?Who would have thought about the song in the opening scene could mean so much? Who would have thought it had something to do with every single action in this movie; and who would have thought the reason he threw the arc reactor into the ocean would have something to do with it?Who would have noticed the message it brought to us about living in the shadow of your fear? Only the ones that look for it. The mortals, the averages, the normal people, the ones who merely stay after the credits -- they will never find it.",10,5,11,11 May 2013
Man of Steel," Disappointment of the year
","I bring you; three stars out of ten possible -- and DC brings us; the worst disappointment of the year. As the owner of a comic book store, it is not disproportionate to say, I love comics. This movie does not live up to any of them. Not even the worst ones.I expected nothing (as a customer advised me to), yet I was still very disappointed. Without spoiling anything, I do believe I can tell you, there will be pointless action scenes and bad intros. They could have made this movie SO MUCH better, in every possible way. Instead, they made it almost as bad as the previous Superman movies. Not even Hans Zimmer could save this movie (and trust me, his music has saved a lot of movies from the abyss).To sum the foregoing, VERY. DISAPPOINTING. Jeff Albertson",1,3,8,24 June 2013
Evil Dead," Worst. Movie. Ever
","Do I really need to say anything else? I felt like I was watching a comedy, except they didn't get the jokes right.The characters were incredibly dumb, they were so dumb I'd be able to slap them in the face and their reaction would have been to jump out of a window and set fire to themselves for absolutely no reason.The screenplay was absolutely terrible and they were constantly stating the obvious. This movie was so bad, I actually decided to submit a review for it. Something I wouldn't otherwise do unless the movie was either fantastic or as dumb as a box of rocks.",1,47,95,11 May 2013
