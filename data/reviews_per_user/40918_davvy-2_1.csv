The Blair Witch Project," whoa...
","this movie is very original. it captures the true essence of frustration and desperation of the three filmmakers. i found it slightly boring, and then later on i still felt a little bored, yet at the same time tensed up, wondering what the next few minutes will bring...very chilling at the end, but i ended up saying 'huh?' right after it was over. it leaves you confused and asking for more, but that was most probably intentional. recommended if you want a taste of a movie different from all the rest.",8,0,0,8 August 1999
