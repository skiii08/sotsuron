Casablanca," boring
","This movie is so boring. It's a bad movie. 20 minutes into the movie and I already wanted to turn it off because it was so bad. The only reason it's a classic and people like it so much is because it has Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart, it's about nazis, and it has the line 'Here's looking at you kid' which is so lame. I like old movies but not this one.",Null,0,1,2 November 2001
X-Men," Cool movie
","I thought this movie was very cool. The special effects were nice. Hugh Jackman as Logan was cool. I loved this movie. If you haven't seen this movie before, see it. If you have, see it again. I give it 10/10. I thought this movie was really good. It's got humor, action, and a little bit of sadness in it. this movie does not disappoint.",7,0,0,22 May 2001
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," whoa....
","Wow, I went into this movie thinking it would be okay but I was sorely mistaken. This movie was incredibly boring, oh my gosh. About an hour into and I really really wanted to leave, or at least fall asleep. I thought all the other movies were just fine but this was just bad. Even the scene between Yoda and the bad guy was just dumb. I also think they shouldn't have had the love thing going on 'cuz that just seemed like it took away from the movie.",Null,8,15,19 March 2003
The Mummy Returns," This movie rules
","This movie is totally cool. It is better than the first one. I loved this movie. It's got everything you want. You have got to see this movie. If you have seen it before, see it again. This movie rules. From the beginning to the end it is good. If you like movies that start good and end good, see this movie. 10 out of 10.",6,0,0,4 May 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," good
","I am a fan of the books but at first i didn't think the movie would be very good but after i watched the movie I thought it was good. The quidditch match was pretty cool. Hagrid's 'I shouldn't have told you that' was funny. Even if you don't read the books, you should watch the movie.",6,0,1,17 November 2001
Signs," great
","**possible spoilers**This movie was a freaky movie. It gave me chills and tingles. Everytime something jumped out, part of the theater jumped and screamed.I thought all the actors did a fantastic job and it's good to see they didn't use all the blood and gore like some movies did with aliens. I liked how they used the news to show us the little spots in the sky and to show the alien. It used a lot more suspense. See this movie because it's great.",8,0,1,6 August 2002
