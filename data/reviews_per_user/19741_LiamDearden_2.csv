Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," The Funniest Film of the Year!
","I managed to acquire some special screening tickets for this film and I went along with a few friends to one of the last screenings before the film was released to the public. I had watched the 'Ali G Show' which first featured Sasha Baron Cohen as 'Borat' and found that hilarious... the TV series was no match for the film! I had never laughed all the way through a film before watching 'Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'. Borat is recruited by the Kazakhstan government to make a documentary about American (The greatest nation on earth according to Borat) life to help improve his home land. Borat begins his journey in New York through to California meeting real people and putting them through awkward situations, although some situations and meetings are staged, nevertheless it is still incredibly funny! The film contains racism, foul language, prejudice and nudity all blended in to 1 hour and 25 minutes of controversy. Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is well worth a watch and gains a huge 10 out of 10 in my opinion, but be warned this film is not for the easily offended!",10,6,29,24 October 2006
Stranger Than Fiction," Expected More Comedy From Will Farrell
","I knew nothing much about this film, only what I had seen on the trailer and that the cast included Will Farrell. I immediately assumed this was a comedy, yet I found it to be more of an 'easy' watching romance film with a few laughable parts. Enjoyable, but a little disappointing as I went in expecting the usual from Will Farrell, a comedy. I managed to get hold of some advanced screening tickets free of charge to see 'Stranger Than Fiction' so I can't really complain!Plot Summary: Karen Effiel is an author writing her latest novel about an isolated man named Harold Crick. What she doesn't know is that her fictionalised character is real. The real Harold Crick is an IRS agent who has lived a dull existence and one day begins to hear Karen's voice as she narrates what she puts on paper to what Harold has and is doing. Because of this Harold enlists the help of a literary professor to find out what is happening and ends up changing things about his life including beginning a relationship with his IRS client, a government-hating bakery owner named Ana Pascal. Harold, however, finds trouble when he hears that Karen plans to kill him.",7,0,2,30 November 2006
