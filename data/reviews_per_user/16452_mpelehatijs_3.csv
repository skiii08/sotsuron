First Man," Made up story
",How can they count it as a bio pic of they can't prove that USA been to moon ? They don't even go to space because shuttle project was closed. Movie is good but should be classed as fantasy. Enjoy all,1,1,12,6 October 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," So random
","Tarantino is a genius, top 5 for sure. But unfortunately this time it was so random. But the ending was damn fantastic. Hey in 10 years it might become a classic, but for now it's just 2.5 hrs of random moments.",3,4,9,25 August 2019
Get Out," Funny and original story
","It's funny and ridiculous, but original. Truly American story but I would say fantastic for a European. Hot stuff. If u want to have a good night - go for it!!!!",9,0,5,19 October 2019
