Casablanca," One of the two greatest American films
","'Casablanca' is unquestionably one of the two greatest American films. Everything about it (except possibly the special effects) is either perfect or so close it doesn't even matter. I'm writing this having just gone to see it with my sweetie at a packed-house Valentine's Day showing in a restored classic movie palace. If you ever have the chance to see a beautiful print of this film on a really big screen in such a venue, with an audience totally in love with it, DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT pass up the opportunity! When people used to refer to the 'silver screen,' it's this movie and a few others that they were talking about--it literally shimmers like finely wrought silver.Oh yes, the other greatest American film? 'Citizen Kane,' and for many of the same reasons. Interesting that these two films were made almost at the same time, 'CK' being released in 1941 and 'Casablanca' in 1942.",10,6,9,10 February 2007
