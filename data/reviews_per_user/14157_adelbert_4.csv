Requiem for a Dream," A Credo for Reality
","Requiem for a dream: a beautiful name for a film, wherein people are driven, like lunatics, to their little, only for a moment, suspension of the unbearable lightness of their incredible desires just as Stanley Kubrick showed us in A Clockwork Orange. A requiem for all those who purchase the candles for hope in a world where immediately satisfaction is like a candle in the church of their dreams, followed by a requiem: let us not forget them who showed us the credo of reality.",8,0,0,28 July 2002
Memento," Memento, Remember, thou Lenard that thou forget
","Memento Remember thou, Lenard that thou  will not forget that thou forget. Memento Lenard that thou will learn every second something to forget: your identity now and here. Remember thou that thou have to reinvent your own life for a couple of seconds. That thou only known what thou were. That thou only can reconstruct your own past by living backwards. Remember thou that thou forgot to kill the right person, although thou are not a killer. Thou had already done it. Thou have every day the occasion to be another men. Memento that thou are living in an eternal now. Don't forget it. There is no past, nor now, nor future. There is just some now to write it on your body: your past, now and future, your help. I will not forget you. Nor you nor this memorable film that show the disaster of loosing your memory. To know and see that other people can do what they will. Timeless. The eternal now.  Memento it.",7,0,3,28 July 2002
Lost in Translation," Totally lost?
","Where  is the human person who is smoking his sigarette? There in the street on the LED panels of an another car. He is hiding his own face with his hat in the hope that nobody has seen him, only a 'translation' of wat he perhaps could be: an ordinary person, watching his TV, looking  his digital clock, because time is here also translated in the time of ohthers: their 'own' time. Deep packed in there loss; there, are only their 'hypocritical' answers following the rules of etiquette (and money) without a personal meaning. Translation is here not a communicating with a an other person, trough an interpreter, but a betrayal  where verbal and nonverbal communication is constantly contradicting each other. The hell, here, everthing is not what it looks, etc.",9,0,1,25 April 2004
Eyes Wide Shut," Unbelievable 'fairy tale' about jealousy
","When you want to know what a little word can do, then you have understood the word jealousy. It's a pity that the film has been seen as a sex film. Indeed there is but it's all functional. What n a word, said, Shakespeare: in the film you can see with close eyes what a word can do.",9,0,1,13 July 2002
