Marie Antoinette," I loved it.
","I thought this movie was amazing. Honestly, at first, I didn't like the use of modern music and I kept saying 'Why didn't they use period appropriate music?' But much to my shock, it grew on me to the point of obsession. Now, I can't imagine the movie without it. The movie is beautifully filmed, exquisitely costumed and simply, a feast for the eyes. I cannot wait to see it again - I am sure there is much I missed the first time. I am not a Kirsten Dunst fan per se, but to me, she IS Marie Antoinette. She showed us the young and vulnerable side of the Queen that is often overlooked in the history books. Do yourself a favor ... see this film.",Null,4,8,20 October 2006
