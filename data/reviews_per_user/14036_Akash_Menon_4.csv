Hereditary," *Cluck*
","Rating: 9In the coming years, Hereditary will belong to the Hall Of Fame of Horror movies. Ari Aster's breakthrough with this movie show's his take on the horror genre.The Good - Acting. I would consider this movie to be Collette's best. The movie should be appreciated for the acting, the soundtrack Stetson implores, the cinematography and the outright occultism practice.The Bad - I know there would not be any sequel coming off, but I desperately want more of this film.While watching this movie please watch it not for the jumpscares but for the art behind it. The main focus of this movie is on tragedy and occultism. I cannot delve deeper into making you watch this, but I am sure the feeling you would be left with are chills and creeps.",9,0,0,9 April 2020
1917," A Visual Treat!
","The movie no doubt deserves the Oscar it received for Best Cinematography, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Mixing. The camera movement in this movie is first-rate.The Good - I loved the visuals in the movie. The actors put up a great performance too. The narrative of the story was gripping. It keeps you on your seat till the end. Moreover something that caught me off-guard was the cameos!The Bad - I could only cringe at the moments when the lead was making stupid decisions. The movie could have ended quite early but they had put in drama to increase the running time.I would not say this movie is a must-watch but it is definitely a good movie. I appreciate the cinematography for this movie. A tip - Please watch the movie on a big screen, the visuals are so similar to Dunkirk. And watch out for the cameos!",8,0,3,13 April 2020
Midsommar," A straight slasher movie about a Swedish Cult!
","Rating: 7The title is the best summary I can put up for the movie. I cannot describe this movie in a better sense for I myself couldn't understand the motive behind it. After producing a movie like Hereditary, I believe Aster failed to shine on this one. The only reason I am giving it a 7 is because of it's outstanding visuals. I like art-movies which have beautiful visuals and this does not sway from the trend. The theme of the film also revolves around manipulation. It shows how cults tend to manipulate the weak by seducing them in showing the world their way.The Good - The cinematography and the acting. I appreciate the visuals, the vividness and the brilliant acting put up by Florence Pugh. I also like the fact how some scenes turn out to be outright hilarious, disturbing and sad.The Bad - Although Pugh's acting was great her character was whining at every moment in the film. I don't know whether to sympathize with the character or just be depressed by it. The movie involves grotesque rituals which will either be comical or disturbing to you.I could find symbolism in the movie and I wouldn't point it out as I would like for you to see it. The movie is for the people who appreciate experimental, art-movies. If you want to watch a horror movie for jumpscares, this movie is not for you.",7,2,7,10 April 2020
Rear Window," 'An Idle Mind Is The Devil's Plaything'
","A straightforward, well laid out, gripping plot. It is a classic Hitchcock film which ranks up in terms of acting, sound, cinematography and the storyline.The Good - The movie is a work of art. It emphasizes on the theme of voyeurism. It shows how curiosity can lead to unimaginable things. The plot is straightforward and the movie builds up the suspense right to the end. All the actors and actresses have shown immense devotion to their roles which marks them in the Hall Of Fame.The Bad - I cannot sense the flaws in the movie. The movie is diamond. It was released at the time cinema was developing. Auteurs like Hitchcock make this movie an impeccable piece of art which thrills the audience in their seats.Rear Window is a must *watch* however don't be misled by the voyeurism it portrays. As the famous saying goes 'Curiosity killed the cat' :)",8,1,1,9 April 2020
