The Sound of Music," A loaf of Wonder Bread!
","Hey, its not Lost Horizon!The Sound of Music is a colorful bloated bland musical that Julie Andrews does not really fit. I was never convinced she was a nun, or wanted to be a nun; she was just Julie Andrews pretending to want to be a nun.I don't know my history very well, but this was probably made after she lost the role of Elisa Dolittle in the movie version of My Fair Lady. I think she was still miffed.The movie is OK, its like a big loaf of white bread that has no texture. But it could be worse; we could have Ross Hunter and Burt Bacharach and a troop of truly no talent people banging around the stage dodging polar bears and ferns at the top of the world! The Sound of Music is a good movie for insomniacs.",4,2,12,4 June 2014
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Antidote to Fanaticism
","Perhaps to really appreciate this film you have to have a knowledge of history; it is not just sophomoric humor, it is humor based in the historical milieu of the time.Judea was, as always happens in the Middle East (it must be something in the water), fighting both outside invaders and inside itself, between Jewish factions. The 'Judean People's Front', 'The People's Front of Judea' and all the rest were real,though not in actual name. One truth of history is that a foreign power is able to conquer new territory by exploiting the infighting that is often there. Romans didn't have to resort to the tactics of the present day CIA and infiltrate factions to incite civil war; the nations in those days were already doing that. Hence the reference in the scene, 'What have the Romans ever done for us?', 'Well, they brought peace, no one else could have with this lot!'It is a paradox that the Romans, through conquering, brought peace. That was the great power of the Roman Empire. They were in the right place at the right time.'Life of Brian' made me appreciate Jesus. This film world was probably more on the mark than we think. After all, who really did say that Jesus did all the miraculous things others said? His later followers.I believe Jesus was a human being who did change the world with his message of peace and love; the fact that he was a man makes it all the more miraculous. After all, Gods can do that miracle stuff; it's their job. But this lone man, Jesus, brought the message of love and peace to the world; what we do with that message is up to us. Christianity used to be based on the concept of 'following Jesus', living according to his teachings. Today, the Christian concept seems to be standing in front of Jesus with your hand out saying, 'Hey, Dude, I believe in all that stuff, whatever you said; now give me salvation.' It is the Idiot's Guide to Salvation.This movie is about the beginning of such hypocrisy; the factions with their shoes and gourds and condemnation of each other. Jesus did his thing; they made it what it is today, and poor Brian was caught in the middle.This is a wonderful film. I agree that to appreciate it fully, one has to know that it is based in truth. All great humor has a serious foundation. To view 'Life of Brian' only as a comedy makes it seem perhaps shallow. It is not.",Null,2,6,18 July 2011
