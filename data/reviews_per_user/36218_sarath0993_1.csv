The Expendables 2," Amazing
","Its continuation of Expendables 1 and 2. It has many different characters..Though many characters are included in this part seems good.But definitely we will miss Lee Christmas's action and JetliHope they will give unique role to everyone like Expendables 1.. Because so many didn't like many roles in this movie,so if it was like 1st part then It could reach more success.The most awesomeness part in this movie is its climax. Looking forward for Next one in series..Great acting by Sylvester Stallone at this age..He is just awesome",8,0,0,26 August 2014
