The Avengers," Predictable story, visual masterpiece
","I was drawn into watching this movie by the promising graphics more than anything else. I'm not a comic book aficionado in the least, so I went into the movie without any of that background knowledge. Nor did I need it, as I soon found out. There's enough back story inserted to get folks through & the back story of the characters isn't really integral to the story, I thought.The plot was VERY predictable. There was nothing new or original about it. Can easily see where the story is heading and pretty easy to guess how it will end. So, in that regard, I'd give the movie a 1 out of 10.Where this film shines -- and is downright amazing -- are the majority of the graphics. Fantastically intricate CGI work! From that aspect, I'd give the movie a 9 out of 10.So, basically, this is a great one if you're looking for mindless entertainment as the story line isn't a challenge to follow. Definitely a feast for the eyes!",Null,5,10,30 September 2012
The Hunger Games," Watchable, but not great
","I'll preface the review with the fact that I did not read the book(s) it was based on. While, an avid reader, it's normally not the type of book I'd pick up with any great interest. However, the movie trailer got my attention as did the premise behind it. Not having heard of the book(s), it struck me as a more unique and interesting story than the usual fare offered in movies these days.The movie wasn't terrible. It has issues, though. Without nitpicking at the little things, the biggest short-coming is the lack of character development. It's hard to get emotionally invested in any of them because there's very little effort made (or maybe just very little success) to give the characters any real depth or characteristics that a viewer can really identify with. There are just too many holes in the story.... How the world got where it got and so on...So, in short.... The movie was watchable, but it obviously fell very short of what it could have been. I really feel that they should've gone with better, more extensively detail in their adaptation of the book and taken the R-rating that would obviously have come with it. The teenage drama they tried to make believable just didn't work given the context (even their version of it) and the lack of character development.While I can't call this type of movie 'entertainment' given the context, it does make one think and question the depths of depravity people can fall to.... Is such a world so far-fetched? Might not be...",Null,0,2,30 September 2012
The Revenant," Gory and booooooring!
","One goes to the movies, usually, to be entertained & escape reality... This movie was so gory and graphic that it provided neither an escape from reality nor entertainment. Some of the scenes are stomach turning. The plot is predictable which makes the drawn out length of this horrible movie completely pointless -- the story could've been told in 30 mins. (tops). The acting was pretty mediocre .... Not much acting to be done aside from dragging oneself along on the ground and breathing heavy through half the movie.I honestly couldn't see any reason for the high rating this movie has on this site nor understand the whole Oscar 'buzz' over it... Truly one of the worst movies I've seen in a while.To sum up... Don't waste your time. Or if you choose to waste it, make sure you're not eating while you watch... UGH!I'd give this long-winded bit of trash a negative rating if possible.",Null,11,21,3 February 2016
Drive," Why is this POS getting such rave reviews!?!?
","Alright, I've seen some bad movies in my day, but this one may well be one of THE worst. The plot is terrible, the acting pathetic, casting roles don't fit the actors cast.... The list just goes on an on. I just don't see what in the world people who gave it good reviews saw... Stunt driving? Give me a break! For a movie about a 'driver' there is very little stunt driving to be seen. The driving shown in the trailer is the best you're gonna get for that. The rest of the movie moves along at a gawd awful, painfully slow pace. It's bad enough the plot plodded along like a slug in the desert at high noon, but they added the additional insult of slowing down the frame rates in about half the movie. The blood and gore was completely unnecessary and nauseatingly graphic. Character development is pretty much non-existent. The main character played by R. Gosling dragged along like a manic-depressive & had no real identity.All in all, terrible movie!! 2hrs. that felt like 8.",Null,29,61,29 September 2011
The Lion King," More About the Eye Candy
","Unfortunately, this remake is more about the eye candy than the original story... That said, the CGI is amazing! I'd watch it again for that alone.... I don't agree that all the heart and soul of the story has been stripped away, but those who REALLY liked the cartoon versions of TLK for the story aren't likely to like this remake of the movie. For fans of CGI and those who want to be wowed by the visuals in a movie, will at the very least like this movie for that....To sum up, the loyal fans of TLK should probably stay away from this one.... CGI lovers, enjoy =)",Null,1,2,12 October 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Terrible!
","Big name, big budget, big actors, terrible movie! The other movies in the series were very good in my opinion.... And then the crap hit the fan with this latest installment. First of all, it's not Bourne without M. Damon -- he's the face of the franchise, he wasn't killed off, there's no reason for making a sequel without him (and if he doesn't want to be in another Bourne movie, then there doesn't need to BE another Bourne movie). Second, the acting was pretty bad in this new installment. The actors aren't necessarily bad themselves generally, but they really didn't fit these roles. Third, the camera work is atrocious to say the least! Most of the action scenes were simply unwatchable! To sum up, this sequel is an insult to the rest of the Bourne series. It didn't add anything to the original 3 movies before it. If you don't want to ruin the Bourne movies for yourself, skip this one.As a standalone (with a diff't title), it might've (though not likely) been a decent movie, but as a follow-up to the Bourne trilogy it absolutely bombed.",Null,2,7,24 December 2012
Super 8," Why is this getting such great reviews?
","*** Might Contain Spoilers ***I don't understand how such a horrible movie is getting rave reviews here. The acting was terrible, the camera work even worse. The plot? Please... It's like another attempt as E.T. but this one came up way short. The story is completely unoriginal. The scenes of things blowing up and car wrecks were well done, but, come on, take a train head on and survive? Ridiculous... I was completely bored. Just seemed like the whole movie was pieced together by kids trying to make a movie, quite frankly. The movements of the creature were jerky and poorly rendered. The creature's existence on Earth was never really explained.Yeah, things go flying through the air and the train wreck looks great in 3D, but that's about where the good moments end with this movie. Honestly feel that the trailer was better than the whole movie.Don't waste your time...",Null,62,107,17 June 2011
The Wolf of Wall Street," Don't Get It...
","... boggles my mind why this crappy movie is hailed as such a work of art. It's a terrible movie. Virtually a work of pornography, really... Filth, drug use, irresponsible behavior and all of it a pack of lies. May be based on some true story somewhere, but it certainly doesn't mirror any semblance of reality anywhere.The acting... Yeah it's great when the script is crap and the actors just have to pretend to hump like rabbits and get high left, right and sideways. Doesn't take much acting skill to pull of a porno.Horrible waste of time movie! Something is definitely wrong in Hollywood when this type of crap is lauded as a great award worthy movie. Should be ashamed of themselves, honestly...",Null,12,20,26 February 2014
