The Hangover," Cliché Galore
","I do not understand why this movie was so overrated. It is loaded with cliché after cliché. Bachelor party at Las Vegas, check. Fat retarded cousin who's also a math genius that can count cards and beat Vegas, check. Got married with a hooker in Vegas and woke up without remembering it, check. Tiger locked up in hotel room, check. Stole a police car, check. A small Asian guy in the trunk, check. P* ssed off the head of mafia/gang/triad, check. Cameo appearance of Mike Tyson, check. Get punched by Mike Tyson, check. I bet the director also had some midgets and she-males in it before cutting it out. Just wait for the extended version. It's basically a tribute to all the bad comedies in the history of Hollywood. If you find peeing in Mike Tyson's pool is funny, this movie is for you. The humor is just very juvenile. The target audience is North American Male, preferably a meat head, between the age of 17 to 35. It is not very offensive by any means, it is just not too creative. If you think bizarre is creative, then it is very creative because it is loaded with bizarre incidences that needs no explanation other than some alcohol and some drug. I hope young kids don't think drug is so much fun after seeing this movie. It somewhat glorifies drug use in a goofy way. Yeah, see all the fun experience we had and we ended up just fine!",3,10,20,14 September 2009
Cloverfield," An audio and visual assault
","Making a movie is definitely a team project, which involves a group of talented professionals spending considerable amount of time and money in shooting, editing and post production finishing, presumably test viewing of something that theoretically, should at least turn out to be reasonably acceptable judging by common sense of an average person. It is exactly this nature of movie making that makes me the more bewildered and dumbfounded whenever I witness something that's truly awful. Unfortunately, this movie turn out to be one of them.The whole movie is made from the perspective of a rather loud and dimwitted individual defies all common sense, shakes and bumps his handycam throughout 10 hours of ordeal of his friends trying to survive an apocalyptic event. During the 2 hours sitting, I've been constantly asking myself, why hadn't anyone who participated in the making of this movie tried to ask this one simple question: isn't it more plausible for him to ditch the camera and run for his life? Why on earth did he keep recording instead of offering a helping hand like a normal human being when his friends needed his help the most.Common sense aside, the viewing experience is crude and downright torturing. It is actually physically nauseating. I kept wishing that the cam is just a deploy before the real movie begins. I was wrong. By the end of the movie, which is one of those wtf ending, I felt violently ill.I understand the intention of the director, which is trying to make this movie appear to be as real as possible. It turned out to be a really cheap trick and gets so obvious and old 30 minutes into the movie. How can you convince your audience the experience is real when the very gimmick to draw your audience in totally unreal at the same time. A real person would have put down the damn camera as soon as the hell broke loose. Instead, the guy kept shooting and mouthing and yelling and violently shaking the camera for 2 hours.There're just so many this type of movie out there nowadays. So the director choose to do something different, which is understandable. But he ultimately failed when he decided to put all of his eggs in this one shaky basket. He bet the whole movie on the 'Blair Witch Project' inspiration. I know the comparison had probably been made by others already. They are not the same. The difference is: it works well for Blair Witch Project, it totally failed for this movie. Blair witch project had a purpose of filming through the handycam. This movie had no purpose and it's very unappropriated for the guy to keep shooting the cam under this circumstances.",1,18,36,19 January 2008
Knowing," 5 star for being different
","Hollywood has been teasing with 'The End of the World' for decades, none had the heart to actually do it, until this film came along.Nicolas Cage is A depressed 'non believing' MIT professor who lost his faith on causality due to untimely death of his wife. To him, everything in universe is random and meaningless. Things pretty much just happen without any meaningful connection with each other. He walks around like a zombie Oblivious of the fact that everything in life is actually pre-determined, until one day his son received a piece of paper full of mad scribbles from 50 years ago. The scribbles are numbers, predicting events before they actually unfold, down to exactly when, where and how many.Interesting concept, if it is used in a meaningful way. In this case, it made me felt like a prop to fill the giant gap between the melodramatic beginning and the explosive end. There are two ways to interpret this strange phenomenon: 1. Life is indeed pre-determined and pretty much there's nothing you can do about it. 2. Life is not pre-determined but those aliens somehow can know the future. (this sounds really bogus and illogical). The more proper interpretation is that everything is pre-determined. Well, ponder that for a moment tell me if it's not equally bogus. No offense to the religious folks but do you really believe that God pre-determined the existence and the conduct of Adolf Hitler as well? What for? This film got itself in the same trap of those pre-deterministic religions.The center piece of this story is a piece of paper with numbers written on it. What exactly is the meaning of this information? Is it a warning? What is a warning good for if you can not benefit from it? Warning: you will all die and there's nothing you can do about it. Great! Thanks for having me running around getting all hot and bothered for this eventual and inevitable death. The time might be better spend on tea and biscuit! Aside from the giant plot hole and quite literally WTF center concept, Nicolas Cage is actually quite good and convincing. The kids on the other hand, turned into one of those emotionless aliens before departing earth and humanity. Can you at least wait a few years and let them grow into it? Also, what's up with the rocks? I hope it will be explained in the director cut edition.",5,1,3,13 April 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," A mild case of Benjamin Button
","Watching Benjamin Button's life unfolding on screen is like watching a reverse process of sunset. Wouldn't that be 'sunrise'? You may ask. No, it is not sunrise, it is a reverse sunset. What exactly does it mean then? That's the question that got me scratching my head upon the moment the credit started rolling on the screen.Mystically affected by a giant clock that was built by an agonizing father who wish to turn back time so his son would not have died in WWI, Benjamin was born with a rare condition. He was born a dying old man who would then grow younger and younger everyday. Does this unique ability offer Benjamin any special perspective on life? Well, one can not really tell as Benjamin pretty much lived the same way like you and me, except the apparent anomaly noted above. His uniqueness or weirdness was rather well accepted by everyone he encountered. People treated him absolutely like any other human being, sometime even better. Following the same line of complaint, everybody got along surprisingly well from early 20's all the way to present time. Consider the racial tension, war time and economical depressions throughout the era, the movie's fairy tale like peaceful setting makes me feel rather disconnected from the time and space it was trying to depict.In the early part of this film, looking oddly like a well behaved and well dressed Gollum, our Benjamin mostly sit quietly an observer. He's more like a senile old man than a reckless child with an old man's body. He pretty much persisted in that way throughout the rest of the film, never angry, never overly joyful, and never showed any true anguish, conflicts or depression, nor did he showed any fear. He pretty much accept life with a tired smile and life pretty much treated him the same way. Such complacency nullified any dramatic undertone that the director may try to paint.The second part of the movie was driven by the love story between Benjamin and his childhood friend Daisy. Though know her since very young age, Benjamin's life was pretty much parallel to her until they collide in midpoint, at conveniently ripe age for love.Now, the story of Benjamin's life was told by the narratives from hospital bed ridden old Daisy and her daughter's reading of Benjamin's dairy. I don't know why director chose to tell the story this way. It never added anything to the story. As matter of fact, it completely ruined any surprises and fail to draw emotional response from viewer by way of the unknown twist and turns of the love story. Because from the very early on, we already know that this old woman is Daisy who must be a significant part of Benjamin's life, they must have fallen love with each other and they must have spent big chunk of their lives together. This really had taken away the effect of the love story between the two on audiences.After the high point of the relationship between Benjamin and daisy, the movie pretty much proceed like a receding tide, there are some spots of minor waves here and there, but mostly, Benjamin fades into obscurity.This movie, like Benjamin's eventful yet oddly emotionally bland life, can be likened to a peaceful sunset in reverse. It is not quite a sunrise, because though Benjamin grows younger, he ages mentally pretty much the same way like rest of us. This special gift of reverse aging doesn't seem to award him any special wisdom nor give him any dramatically different perspectives on life. His life is pretty much void of any conflicts. Things come and go quietly. Nothing on the screen really stirs up a big storm though Benjamin had been through plenty of storms throughout his life and eventually came out all unharmed and hardly even bothered. Because of this, I considered the movie somewhat a disappointment because the it failed to fulfill the potential of the unconventional premise of the source material.There are few points to note, though they are never really fully fleshed out. Benjamin seems to have a very keen sense of the causal effects of time and events. At certain key points of movie, he's able to reconstruct a seemingly random event from the perspective of an agnostic determinism. Upon investigating a little deeper, I realize that Benjamin, though age reversely, did not actually live life reversely. Therefore, the perspective came rather unnaturally, forced and out of place, especially the sequence proceeding the third encounter with Daisy. (I shall not spoil any plot).From the technical point of view, this movie deserves a sound applause. From the music score, set design, special effects and the cinematic, they are all well polished and skillfully executed. The make ups and the facial special effects is extremely well done consider that this movie would not be possible at all without it. The facial special effects can be a little distracting from time to time, but it is still among the best I've seen in Hollywood.Overall, it is one of the better movies in 2008 though failed to fulfill its full potential.",6,0,3,31 December 2008
Into the Wild," Away from life, into the wild
","Enlightenment comes from experiencing. If you never had anything, how can you ever give up anything? I recently watched a movie that tells a totally opposite story. It was about a young Tibetan monk who walked away from the life of detachment and lived for a while like a normal person, fell in love, got married and had children ... until one day, he walked away again, back to the life of detachment and seclusion. On the contrary, Into the wild tells a story about a young man who try to run away from civilization and be alone with the nature.Deep in the core of these two opposite stories lies the same bare naked truth of humanity. There are something one can never seem to escape no matter where you are and what kind of life you are living.Here's our young hero, torn and tired of the inconsistency, viciousness and lies of his parents and the toll that it's taking on his conscience, decided to just walk away, far far away from everything as humanly as possible. He took on a symbolic journey to seek the absolute truth that's free from the contamination of human touch. He walked 'Into the wild' with all of his arrogance and earnest, equipped with nothing but his stubborn grip and fascination on a place called Alaska, where true meaning of life can be found.On some level, it reminded me of my younger self, and all the anguish and suffocation I experienced after the teen years. The time when we were old enough to supposedly bear the burden of decision making yet not quite experienced enough to weigh in all the choices. The time when life was all of a sudden upon us.On a very personal level, quite strangely, this movie hit me hardest not with its depiction of the wild but the depiction of human interaction. To me, that's where it truly shines brightly, so brightly that it washed out the dark and lonely hours of 'Into the wild'.This is not the kind of movie that gives you any closure. There's no triumph nor enlightenment. It present a slice of life as it is, charming and flawed like the main character. Contrast to young McCandless' bleak and cynical world view, you will only remember his bright and innocent smile, the warm sparkles in his eyes, the brief yet achingly beautiful moments of human interaction that he often abruptly run away from.You may not necessarily learn anything from the main character, but you will definitely draw something truly valuable from his experience. Somewhere in a dark and obscure corner of the earth, there's a Chris McCandless lay underneath the stars, gazing on its vast tranquility, dreaming of his Alaska. For me, Chris McCandless didn't go 'Into the Wild', he went into himself, searching for an idea, a moment of pure authenticity, something that had eluded him.",9,0,1,11 February 2008
Taken," Explosive Liam Neeson with a justifiable cause to kill
","This movie has pretty much caught everyone by surprise as it was released months later in North America in low key after being released in Europe in 2008.There are few things that made this movie really enjoyable and stand above the rest of Hollywood's action flicks. The lead actor, Liam Neeson, has such a overwhelming presence on screen. He commands attention and respect with such authenticity. Contrast to other younger Hollywood pretty boys, he's what you would call a real man. In this case, he a father who's on a mission to bring back his daughter from the hands of smugglers. He's confident, extremely motivated, skillful and brutally straight to the point. The no nonsense take on screenplay, directing and acting has really impacted me like a punch right on the nose. There's no fancy bullet time tricks and high flying kicks, every hit is simple, effective, and cut right to the bone.Being directed and written by Europeans also gives us a different perspective in portraying the European underground crime world. The underlying tone was pretty dark and desperate, pit the lone Liam Neeson against the world of evil. The grittiness of the reality helps intensify the emotion and make the bloody revenge more satisfying. This is not Guy Ritchie's British crime drama which was trifled with smart mouthing and comical coincidences. This is life or death, all or nothing. Bring back home my daughter, or die without ever seeing her again. On top of all these, this movie also has a break neck pacing. It draws you in right from the start and won't let go. It could be one of those rare movies that can be just as entertaining watching it the second time.Go watch this movie, and have a good time.",9,0,0,17 February 2009
The Happening," It's actually the best M. Night Shyamalan's movie so far
","It's actually one M. Night Shyamalan's movie that has a relevant meaning. Unlike many of those who hated this movie, I'm actually not Mr Night's fan. I mildly enjoyed 6th sense but generally found all of his other movies pretentious and heavy handed, except this one. This is his only movie so far that doesn't have a twist ending, which is a good thing! This time, Mr. Night doesn't mind showing you the blood and gore, which really took me by surprise. The visual horror is a double edged sword. It can be funny to watch, which may take away some seriousness of the subject. It also takes away the subtlety. Once you see it happening in front of your eyes, you are somewhat desensitized.Though there are no plot twist, I am still quite intrigued and involved through the whole time. I'm literally glued to the screen, anticipating and guessing what will happen next. The pacing is effective and dialogue are simple and down to earth. It makes you feel those characters are more real. Regardless if the characters are likable or not, you still care what's happening on the screen and how the story unfold.Some people complain that the characters have no depth. Here's the thing about the movies that are depicting catastrophic event: because of the time span are usually limited to few hours or a few days in these type of movies, there's very little room for character development. Therefore, the director would usually tell a bigger story through the characters, not so much about the characters. I really don't care that much about any one individual in the story about extinction of human race. I'm more concerned about how story unfolds through character's eyes.Some people also attempt to analyze and criticize the science behind the story. Well, here's what I'm going to say to that: unless you are a real biologist, don't bother trying to criticize the plot because you only come off sounding really stupid and ignorant. Nobody can yet explain some of the plant behaviors and we are only finding out more and more unexplainable things about plants recently.It is definitely quite different from all of his previous movies, yet, you feel the similar tension build up. There are some flaws here and there, but generally speaking, it is a very entertaining experience without the pressure of pulling off some unbelievable plot twist. Therefore, I enjoyed it much much more than his other movies.Another thing I really liked about this movie is that you can find humor in the most unexpected situation. The over the top gore and hysteria at certain moments really comes off rather comical. I'm not sure if they are intended or not, but they let you peer inside human psyche in a very bizarre way. I won't give out too much details in case you haven't seen the movie. All in all, it's surprisingly good, engaging and entertaining. The character may not have witty dialogs or use fancy word play, but who really give a fly pig about fancy word play? If you want unrealistically pretentious fancy word play, go watch a sitcom, in which every single word uttered is carefully crafted to make you go: yeah, that's really smart and funny and inventive. People in real life don't talk like that.",8,2,10,6 July 2008
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Michael Bay is a scam artist who ought to be tested for substance abuse
","I got the impression that Michael Bay did not actually do much directing in this movie. He was actually sitting at home and getting high the whole time while some computer geeks working feverishly on the special effects. There is no sign of a written script. Dialogues seems to be made up on the spot. Throw in some stock military footage of jet fighters and helicopters taking off and flying around, and some crazy editing of random shots of actors confused facial expression, running around in slow motion, yelling at each other in nonsensical gibberish, you have the movie! The editing and camera crew ought to be lined up and tested for substance abuse. No sober person could come up with this jumbo heap of mental diarrhea.There is a strange consistency in Michael Bay's work. It has the look and feel of a US army's recruiting commercial. He is one of those current generation directors who make the whole movie looks like an ad campaign. The style works for ad campaign because the audience get an vague impression of what is going on but to find out what is really going on, they will have to go to the store and buy the product. It does not work for the movie because here, the movie IS the product. Michael Bay's character are also very loud and hyper. Come to think of it, I think they should send the whole film crew for drug testing, especially the director himself.Also, I sense some cynical sarcasm in this sequel. It is so bad that it seems to be some sort of self deprecating parody. It is like Michael Bay is trying to paint a cartoon picture of himself that exaggerates all of his flaws. You know the kind of pictures in Mad Magazine. It is a pretty expensive joke consider the budget of this movie. But then again, like the title suggested, Michael probably scammed all those money away because this movie, though looks like very expensive on the surface, can probably be made with much less money consider 95% of the screen time are filled with computer generated effects. He could have out sourced the special effects to India or China, where mad 3d animation genius are working for peanuts. Hence my accusation of him being a scam artist.My dad, being an old man from Asia, had never heard of Michael Bay before. He watched the movie for a bit and asked me if the movie was directed by a lunatic. He was very serious and sincere when he asked that question. I couldn't help and started laughing hysterically, while my poor dad looking at me, truly scared and concerned.",4,1,6,29 September 2009
There Will Be Blood," Admired by the feeble minded, hyped by the spineless
","To be honest, this movie deserves more than a one star, but I gave it one star anyways as I see more than what's wrong with this movie but pop culture in general in today's world.This is a movie that's solely about a man's obsession, to the point of perversion.The director used a very simple trick. He created a monster that defies all valid social context but somehow thrived and survived against all odds. The movie's minimalistic presentation gives an impression of authenticity and realism, yet you have a character that's unrealistic to a comical extend.There's this man who hate, distrust and despise everyone, yet he confront them constantly as he wishes to prove and validate something he believes to be non existence to begin with. From there, all manners of confusion and oddity arise. A man who had everything easily obtainable yet often frustrated and angry as if life has been depriving him of opportunities. Talking about not making sense! He's more cynical than the Satan himself. Thank God that he's been occupied by all these oil business. Otherwise, he would make a perfect serial killer.The first 30 minutes have no dialogs. We are presented with this character that comes off as very little human like, and he persisted to be that way through out the whole film. Once he started talking, he's all of a sudden a man of great persuasion skills, oozes with will power and determination, and some kind of unapologetic charisma. He's an opportunist, cold and calculated. Yet he comes off to be extremely emotional and are set off by the slightest detection of insincerity. When you fuse all these contradictory personalities into one man, you would end up with a Picasso piece, a monstrosity of a character that's devoid of any real human qualities that you can relate to. For those who can't see through all these trickery are easily taken by the bold style and brute force. For me, it's a disaster.The music is as nonsensical, menacing and crude as the character. It is there to built tension when there's actually little or nothing happening on the screen, just like the scrutinizing cold stare of Daniel Day Lewis, it offends and provokes with little or no reason.The whole thing may very well work for those who are easily manipulated, as it can be witnessed here. Beyond the facade of cinematic trickeries that feeds off the fear and bewilderment of audience, there's nothing of substance here. Same can be said about 'No Country For Old Man'. It is a trend of directory style that's heavy on niche trickery, very little on character development. Because they believe that you don't need to understand the character, you just to be overwhelmed by it. It is indeed becoming a trend, spreading at an alarming rate. Before long, the screen will be filled with psychopath with very little human like qualities. I fear the worst, when those characters are to be admired and imitated by the feeble minded, and hyped by the spineless.",1,76,153,1 March 2008
Arrival," Sad reminder of the lack of true classics in this generation
","What's good about this movie: The strongest point of this movie is the well-developed emotional arch for the female lead, which makes a rather nonsensical plot line somewhat relatable at least on the emotional level. Now on to the bad: The idea of friendly and benevolent alien face off with idiotic, paranoid and violent human is nothing new. Also, as some may have already mentioned, many of the plot details are laughable at best and rather insultingly nonsensical at worst. Crossing of barrier of space-time continuum, traveling billions light years to earth, an alien technology so advanced that they can defy the law of gravity and suspend aircrafts the size of a big island in midair, yet somehow, all the greatest minds and biggest decision makers on earth believe that such advanced being can be deterred by bullets, bombs and explosives. More unbelievably, even with the tightest security control, some idiotic crew members somehow managed to sneak in a c4 explosive and hopefully blow the aliens away with a single C4. Near the end, soldiers can just ride up in 4x4s like whole bunch of cow boys and spray bullets at the alien air crafts while the Colonel sit in the room like a dumb ass without any control over the situation. The whole movie is a smear campaign of China and Russia. It just feeds right into American's fear of the rising Chinese power. Somehow Chinese are scarier than the aliens, even though they are just fellow human beings. Communicating with Chinese or Russian somehow proved to be more difficult than communicating with aliens. What a load of bullock. Yeah, China is going to destroy earth, but alien saves the day. The fear and alienation of Chinese presented in this movie borderline racism. But don't worry, one single phone call to the Chinese General and some whisper of his wife's dying words will change everything and finally we accomplished the ever elusive world peace! Hurray! Except the two main leads: The scientist guy and the linguistics girl, every single human character in this movie come off like stupid arrogant ass and a disaster waiting to happen. Nobody seems to possess a single ounce of sense. And why bring a bird into the aircraft? If you want to test the air, shouldn't you let the bird in 'before' human?",2,8,17,20 January 2017
Atonement," Meaningless, purposeless and utterly ridiculous
","The whole story evolves around a freakish petty little lie of a jealous, cowardly and spoiled 13 year old girl that costed 2 people's happiness. The end. I'm not sure if I'm watching the same movie that got everybody praising about. There's no bigger meaning, no redemption, no resolution, no moral high ground and certainly no atonement! Instead, it made me feel rather cheap and ridiculous. The character is rather spiteful and cowardly as she eventually admitted in the end.I really don't mind watching a movie that reveals the ugly side of humanity, as long as it's done in a honest and proper way. The problem with this movie is that the story and character is so petty, but the music score and cinemaphotography makes you feel like you are watching an epic tale. It ended up rather strange and disconnected.It is the epitome of English hypocrisy: Petty, dishonest, self indulgent and meaningless. The whole thing has nothing to do with the Second world war. It was thrown in there in a desperate attempt to rub a little bit meaningfulness off the war. But since the premise is so petty, ugly, meaningless and unnecessary, it appears rather awkward. Everything is cheapened, incuding the war. I would rather go to the extend that it perverted the sacrifice of those who died fighthing the war. Remember, the whole story centers around a jealous 13 year old girl who try to destroy the man she couldn't get because he loves her sister. It is eventually a rather perverted little drama that built off such petty intention. It never reached any moral high ground.",1,23,47,24 February 2008
