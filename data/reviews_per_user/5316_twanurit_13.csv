The Sound of Music," Musical Masterpiece
","I can not add much to all the other praiseworthy comments, except to point out Eleanor Parker's (The Baroness) subtle performance. In reaction scenes at the party, she appears convincingly distracted, since she saw her fiancee, The Captain (Christopher Plummer) dancing warmly with the nanny Maria (Julie Andrews). The sultry character is commonly labelled the villainess, but she traveled all the way from Vienna to marry her beau, only to be pushed aside by a (younger) charmer; of course the Captain was a willing participant, too. Acting, script, direction, score, photography still exemplary.",9,3,10,22 November 2002
Lifeboat," See It for Tallulah
","Ms. Bankhead's performance is amazing in this compelling film. In the first scene we are shown astounding destruction at sea from a capsized ship until the camera pans over to a lifeboat where the lone, well-coiffured, mink-draped, all made-up Tallulah is sitting, cross-legged, smoking a cigarette. Then we are shown a close-up of her leg. There's a run in her stocking! She looks more annoyed at that than all the carnage surrounding her! Later on, with more survivors on board and in danger of starving, she worries about how she looks and applies more lipstick! Oh Darling! This is classic cinema and one of the few films of this great lady (she was mostly on stage). John Hodiak (very handsome) is her enemy (at first), while Walter Slezak, Hume Cronin, William Bendix and the others ably support. An astonishing Alfred Hitchcock film.",8,64,85,23 June 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Tacky
","200 years beyond 'Alien 3' (1992) scientists have cloned the DNA of Ripley to create an Alien/Human hybrid (Sigourney Weaver). What was a competent end to a thrilling trilogy has over-extended into a mishmash of one-liners and grotesque situations. Weaver, who sported 4 hairstyles from the 4 pictures, here perpetually damp-haired, is exceptional, as usual. Wynona Ryder, pert and small-boned, is mis-cast as a heroic type; other characters are either obnoxious or undeveloped. The Alien costumes, almost black, are ferocious and look great, except for the underwater sequences. There, they are CGI-created, and look cartoony and lack weight and enough blackness. The film's best sequence is an emotional one, with Weaver finding the lab of previous failed dead clone experiments of herself, culminating in the discovery of a live one. The new monster creation at the end looks like an albino Barney the dinosaur. And the climax takes the first two films' endings to despicable extremes, cruel and bloody.",5,0,0,22 November 2002
Brokeback Mountain," Like Nothing You've Ever Seen Before
","I saw it 2 weeks ago, and still can't get it out of my head. I can't add much to the other superlative reviews on this site except to say that Ang Lee is my favorite director and expect the unexpected in this deeply moving, beautifully performed, amazingly photographed, lovingly scored, perfectly scripted picture. In an early scene, Jack is in the foreground, while Ennis is have half-naked in the background and I said to my companion, he's going turn left to look at him. It didn't happen. That's the mark of a brilliant director (even other fine directors would have Jake glance over). Other untraditional sequences include Ennis' retching at summer's end, the reunion scene, Jack's truck breakdown, Ennis' emotional upheaval in a late fishing trip, and the final sequences that are beyond heart-wrenching. Hope it wins more and more awards.",10,13,15,25 December 2005
Insomnia," I Couldn't Sleep After This One
","This is a riveting, un-nerving, atmospheric psychological crime drama with 3 Academy-Award winners in the leads. They can count on three more nominations early next year from the Academy. Al Pacino is superlative as a detective arriving from Los Angeles to help a murder investigation in a desolate town of Alaska. Pacino's character has many hidden secrets, which would account for his haggard appearance, which worsens after a ghastly accident. Robin Williams is exceptional as a suspect, wisely underplaying the loner role, instead of resorting to over-the-top cliches. And Hillary Swank is ideal as a rookie detective. The Alaskan scenery is a character within itself, alternately beautiful and unsettling. A chase scene over floating logs will leave you breathless; supporting cast is excellent. While the ending may be a bit 'Hollywood-ish', it hardly detracts from this mesmerizing, thought-provoking near-classic.",9,0,0,3 June 2002
Milk," San Francisco Story....
","....that will resonate with the world. Sean Penn channels Harvey Milk beautifully and charismatically starting from 1970 all the way through 1978. Early black-and-white (actual) scenes of police carting out gay bar patrons to jail set the tone for director Gus Van Sant's best work. It's the seamless branching of archival 1970s footage with new photography that truly takes you back over 30 years to a different time and place, lovingly realized here. We see a brief early shot of Dianne Feinstein announce shocking news, as well as Anita Bryant's continued pitch to take away gay rights. Can't add much to the other reviewers comments on the superb supporting cast, but I was really taken by Diego Luna as one of Milk's last lovers, Jack Lira. Of Mexican heritage, he was beaten by his father, and Luna transcends with a mighty characterization of insecurities, heartbreak and devastation. Last part of the film becomes increasingly nerve-wracking and ultimately extremely moving, even to the end credits with the cast/real counterpart images and captions, set to an evocative musical score. A thought-provoking piece that will haunt you for many days.",10,5,12,13 December 2008
Alien," Unbearable Tension
","I was a teen-ager when I first saw this picture back in theaters in 1979. When I got out, my legs were shaking. That hadn't happened to me since I had seen a re-issue of 'Psycho' (1960) in a drive-in. 'Alien' was inspired by a 1958 B & W mini-classic 'It! the Terror From Beyond Space!' The film's terror follows a scene where an astronaut (John Hurt) is infected with an alien organism after a crew of 7 touch down on a planet to investigate a distress signal. What follows will take your breath away, (and leave your eyes semi-closed) with shocking, supremely suspenseful set-pieces, marvelous Ridley Scott direction, authentic-appearing sets, eerie music, an ever-evolving, terrifying Alien costume and superb ensemble playing by the rest of the cast: Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, Ian Holm, Harry Dean Stanton, and Yaphet Kotto.  Followed by three decreasingly effective sequels (so far).",10,0,1,13 June 2001
Pitch Black," Dank, Rank Sci-Fi
","This tale of futuristic space travelers crash-landing on a planet and battling vicious beasts that are afraid of light suffers from undeveloped characters, phony special effects and enough plot holes to fill a spacial black hole. Vin Diesel, while a good actor, reads with a too-sophisticated Greenwich village New York theater background that belies his character's psychopathic origins. Radha Mitchell makes no impression as the spaceship's gutsy female captain. Cole Hauser over-acts outrageously as a bounty hunter. The computer-driven special effects are, as usual, cartoon-ish and unbelievable. One character escapes from a cave with a can of worms, literally, (or florescent slugs) which the monsters resist. Other characters are so disposible we feel nothing when they are banished. To see how this type of film is done most competently, see the 'Alien' series.",6,1,2,30 March 2001
North by Northwest," Conventional thriller with one or two grand set-pieces
","Sandwiched between the sublime 'Vertigo'(1958) and trend-setting 'Psycho'(1960), this thriller obviously pales in comparison. Cary Grant is good as the man caught up in all sorts of mishaps. Eva Marie Saint can not capture the grace, beauty and wit of the magnificent Grace Kelly, and was not the first choice for this role, perceived by MGM as not right for the role. They were right. The actress never really caught on in films, even with the 'On the Waterfront' support Oscar. The 'crop-duster' scene is the major highlight, a magnificently created work of art. The climax on Mount Rushmore is fairly exciting, but ends abruptly. This just doesn't cut it, somehow, especially compared with Hitch's other extraordinary classics.",Null,0,0,13 September 2000
American Beauty," Not Up to 'Ordinary People'
","This is a well-photographed, uniformly grandly acted dark view of suburban life, yet we know how it will end by the opening prologue. Bad mistake. It's a film that won't wear well through the years, not really one to see again and again. See the 1980 'Ordinary People', which is extraordinary through its subdued way of building up to an emotional climax. There's nothing gruesome and obvious about it.",Null,0,0,25 September 2000
Shrek," A Narrative of Torture
","A cute gingerbread man's legs are severed. An innocent frog and snake are blown up like balloons, tied, then set free, to (presumably) gradually die. A would-be king is eaten alive by a dragon. Rats are roasted on a barbecue pit. This is NOT for children, and barely for adults, all leading to a predictable conclusion. The film would be lucky to get one nomination from the Academy (for visual effects). 'Shrek' is drek.",6,0,0,26 November 2001
Ben-Hur," Intelligent, Beautiful Spectacle
","The film won 11 Academy Awards, and deserved all of them, plus more. The script and Stephen Boyd (who wasn't even nominated) should have won. Actually everyone in the cast is superb. Boyd gives the performance of a lifetime and makes a magnificent adversary, for Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston). Their early scenes, scripted by Gore Vidal, exhibit a most settle homo-erotic behavior, featuring Boyd's eye glances, a 'toast' scene where they wrap their arms around each other, culminating in a scene of two arrows (that they both shot) in a wall as phallic symbols. Later the relationship sours, Heston is a slave who becomes a hero, but his mother and sister are in prison, and he returns to see Boyd, now living with a blonde hunk (no female in sight). A towering chariot race ensues, ending their relationship, but sending Ben-Hur on a mission to locate his family, now in a leper colony. Haya Harareet glides in and out as a lovely potential love interest, but special mention must be made of Martha Scott, riveting as the mother, and Cathy O'Donnell, a sweet treasure as the daughter. Any doubts about Heston's acting abilities are forever erased with his sensitive, gripping portrayal of a man who finds Christ. And it is very touching that he's not looking for love, but his beloved family. A stirring masterwork, beautifully scored by Miklos Rozsa, wonderfully directed by William Wyler and co-starring stalwarts Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Sam Jaffe. Probably the best of all the Biblical adventures.",9,1,3,30 March 2001
Signs," A Middling Philosophical Drama
","Yes, the film uses a science-fiction angle as a background story to a widowed minister (well-played by Mel Gibson) who loses his faith, but hopefully re-gains it in the end. No one would probably see a film like this unless there were some aliens involved. The director M. Night Shyamalan cast himself, not too convincingly, in a key role, while Joaquin Phoenix is simply too young to be Gibson's brother, but Cherry Jones is excellent as the town sheriff. Effective elements of producer Val Lewton's 1940s films, 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968) and 'Blair Witch Project' (1999) are utilized here, creating effective suspense and eeriness. The aliens' invasion is very low-key, with a most unsatisfying denouement for their demise. Well-shot, scored and directed, it just doesn't soar.",5,1,1,21 September 2002
