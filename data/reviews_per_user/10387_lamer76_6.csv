Walk the Line," Disappointing and shallow
","Walk the Line is one of those movies that almost everyone likes. So I get labeled as 'harsh' and difficult to please. Well, maybe I am but the thing is I do understand why this film was successful and why people enjoyed it. Technically, there's nothing to criticize. Witherspoon as June Carter is riveting, giving the southern twang an endearing quality. The music is definitely entertaining. I have to admit that scene with Cash and Carter singing a duet of 'Time's a-Wasting' is quite memorable. But for me, that's just not enough.This is a movie about the life of a legendary musician, Johnny Cash, played not-so-brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix. Cash's brother dies in an accident at the beginning, and Mr. Cash senior, who favoured the brother, seemed to blame Johnny for his death. A music lover since childhood, Cash struggles to make a career for himself as a songwriter and performer. He's controversial, messed up and in love with Carter. This is enough to describe the remainder of the movie.Now I don't know much about Johnny Cash and his music, but I can't claim I learned any more after watching Walk the Line. Call me difficult but when I see a biographical film, I expect the makers to put in some effort in trying to understand and portray the different dimensions of the personality in question. All I got was that his brother died, his daddy didn't love him and Carter was the only thing keeping him going. I'm just not convinced that this formed the essence of Johnny Cash and his music.And by the way, I don't know why this is a taboo in Hollywood, but I am brave enough to say it: Joaquin Phoenix is not a good actor. Let's face it.",3,5,10,22 May 2006
Mission: Impossible III," I hope Lost doesn't unfold as this one did.
","Although I haven't been to the theatre for a while, I was more than willing to make an exception for M:I III for two reasons. Call me a teenager but I'm a sucker for Cruise on the big screen. Second, and more important, I was dying to see what the creator of my favourite new show Lost can do in Hollywood. Anyone who can come up with such a creative and gripping series is sure to dazzle in the theatre. So I went...And god how I wish I'd stayed in...The only impossible mission I could find was to transform such a lousy under-developed script into something even remotely entertaining. What's with the latest fad of starting the movie with the scene before the last? Quite simply, it made the first hour meaningless, because we knew the bad guy would eventually escape, that he'd get hold of Hunt's (Cruise) girl and threaten to shoot her (if not indeed shoot her!) if the whereabouts of the 'Rabbit's Foot' is not revealed. Granted the scene is intense and well made, but it is one of the rare good scenes in the movie.So Ethan Hunt is now in love and getting married to super hot nurse Julia (Monaghan  from Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). He no longer works in the field and is instead training agents. Julia thinks he works for the department of transportation but starts to feel something's off when he keeps going away on conferences for a 'few days'. Hunt has actually taken on an assignment to track down agent Lindsey Farrell (Russell) who has been kidnapped by super evil Owen Davian, played eeringly well by Hoffman (from Capote). In fact, Davian is so evil that he places a nitroglycerin capsule inside a person's brain through the nose and activates it once they escape. A few minutes later, the capsule explodes and the victim dies immediately, like a robot that has been turned off. That was probably the only cool gadget in the entire movie. Well OK the other cool gadget was Cruise in a priest's cassock as he sneaks into the Vatican and does his stuff. Nice touch.But seriously, the plot line is thin with hardly any action sequences worth enduring the cheesy scenes for. One memorable one I'd like to share is when Agent Declan (Meyers) and Agent Zhen (Maggie Q) are in the car waiting for Hunt to come out of a building. Zhen starts whispering something and Declan asks her what it was. 'It's just a little prayer that I used to say to get my cat to come home.' A very serious straight-faced Declan replies 'Can you teach it to me?' If that's not vomit-inducing cheese I don't know what is.Anyway, if this movie is any indication of how Lost is going to unfold, then I don't know if I'm gonna be able to watch Season 3... Who am I kidding? I know I will.",4,0,1,23 May 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Brilliant cast, epic love story
","Love is all about the moment, the time spent together, the when and the where. Brokeback Mountain is the setting of that moment, one they could never get back. The rest of their lives is just centered around the memory of Brokeback Mountain, never amounting to much because they got stuck in that time. I'm a sucker for a good gay love story and this film moved me from minute one.Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) are two gay cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963 while working as shepherds on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. Needless to say, their relationship is taboo and they end up leading separate lives, each married and living far apart. They never forget each other and occasionally meet up on 'fishing trips', desperately trying to recapture the time they had together when they first met. Time takes its toll, and the love they felt becomes a burden on both.With a brilliant cast, this epic love story will affect even those most opposed to homosexuality. It's not about gay love. It's about forbidden love. And it is in this love that Lee was able to merge the beauty of midland America with the beauty of a passion that inevitably turns into pain. You can't help but feel it. I know I did.",9,16,18,22 May 2006
Capote," Capote is played fabulously by Hoffman. A must see.
","When Gerlad Clarke was writing Truman Capote's biography, the latter told him 'I won't respect you unless you tell the whole truth'. And in Capote, the biographer, scriptwriter and director have tried to do exactly that. The movie spans five years of the author's life, when he was writing his book, In Cold Blood, about the murder of an affluent Kansas family in 1961. The book probably made him the most famous writer in the US.The investigation into the murder takes a backseat to a thorough examination of Capote's character. Was he a parasitic writer who would do anything to get his story or was he striving for a higher cause? Did 'In Cold Blood' refer to the murder or to the writer's actions? After each scene, you find yourself changing your mind either way. Capote makes you believe that whatever he was doing had to be done for a reason that will be revealed later. Though it is never revealed, the actions cannot be condemned.The movie is superbly written, giving not three, but four dimensions to Truman Capote, who was played fabulously by Hoffman. It's a must see.",9,0,0,22 May 2006
Munich," Spielberg was brave to do this one.
","Writing a review of Munich independent of my personal experience during the war proved a difficult task. After all, I did have nightmares of Israeli operatives targeting all my family members ruthlessly and without any remorse the night I saw it. This says something though, that the movie got to me and for that, I have to give Spielberg credit. I also have to give him credit for being courageous enough to do it. Despite my countless reservations on his so-called objectivity, he did criticize the Israeli revenge policy, advocating the premise that violence only begets violence.The movie recounts the events of Operation Bayonet, the Mossad's retaliation to the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. On the surface, it is an action-packed thriller with good guys and bad guys. The good guys are Israeli agents who speak English to each other while the bad guys are overweight Arabs who only speak in a language the average American will not understand without subtitles (which were not always provided for some reason). But Spielberg manages to sneak in a few scenes that instill doubt in both the viewer and the agents (at least some of them) that maybe the unquestionable morality of the operation is in fact questionable.Munich is highly entertaining, despite its long runtime. It has its cheesy moments but also its confrontational and thought-provoking ones. Although I was expecting a movie that is highly biased  don't get me wrong, it is biased  I felt it sent a strong message to Israelis and to the rest of the world. The best way to describe it is in Carl's (Hinds) words: 'I knew guys like you in the army. You do any terrifying thing you're asked to do, but you have to do it running. You think you can outrun your fears, your doubts. The only thing that really scares you guys is stillness.'",8,5,7,23 May 2006
V for Vendetta," Fun to watch, but nothing more.
","You have to give it to the Wachowski brothers (the writers); they do know how to entertain. But shallow entertainment is all you get out of this completely naive portrayal of totalitarian Britain post-9/11, post-bird flu, post-disintegration of America, post-closure of all underground stations in London. The country is now ruled by a dictator (Hurt) whose only source of power is numbing people with fear of basically everything around them. And for some reason, it seems that the only form of evil government to be found is an exact replica of the Nazi regime. If only the brothers could open their eyes just a little bit, they can see the making of totalitarian governments that abuse people's fears for individual gains all around them.The movie tells the story of assimilated Evey (Portman) who encounters the masked and courageous V (Weaving) when he rescues her from a fate worse than death. V is actually a 'terrorist' who blows things up, among other atrocities, in order to wake the people of Britain from their slumber and remind them that their government is meant to serve them and not the other way round. Evey slowly unlocks the secrets of this mysterious man, uncovering corruption and unspeakable acts that consequently expose her real self.Although Weaving and Fry (as Dietrich) give charming performances, I am still baffled by the choice of Natalie Portman as Evey. Even if the casting director was forced to put in an American actress in order to boost box office returns, couldn't she at least have picked someone who can speak with a British accent? Anyway the movie is actually fun to watch. Just don't expect anything more out of it.",6,1,3,2 June 2006
