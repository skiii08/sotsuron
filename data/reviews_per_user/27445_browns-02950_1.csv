The Finest Hours," It is awful at every level
",This is a disaster movie and I mean a disaster of a movie. A true story is ruined by bad direction at every level. The cast do their best the but the director has the touch of a person wearing boxing gloves. Continuity is amazingly awful too; when you get wet in a storm it's unusual to get dry.,1,0,0,13 January 2020
