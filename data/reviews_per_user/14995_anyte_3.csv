The Blair Witch Project," Why did I bother?
","May I just say that I do NOT recommend this movie.  The jerky hand-held camera being carried through the woods by running people made me feel nauseous.  I left the theatre after the first half-hour or so because I felt ill.  After the end credits began rolling I went into the bathroom at the theatre only to hear a girl vomiting. I wasn't the only one unable to enjoy the film, I guess.  The plot wasn't too bad, the idea of it was rather interesting but very Very poorly executed.  Speaking of executed, I'd rather spend a month camped out in the woods outside of Burkittsville, Maryland than see this movie again.",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
Top Secret!," Loving it.
","More intelligent than most of today's low-brow humor, this 1984 'cult classic' is as original as a spoof can be.  Top Secret is a great comedy mostly because it doesn't take its jokes too seriously.  This movie makes the most out of making fun of stereotypical war-time romance films.",Null,0,1,13 August 1999
Tombstone," Tombstone is good.
",History??? We don't need no stinkin' history!  This movie was excellent not for it's historical accuracy but for an entertaining experience with good acting by all. Especially note worthy was Val Kilmer as the drunken Doc Holliday.,10,16,22,23 August 1998
