Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This scapegoat of a movie definitely needs more appreciation.
","I loved this movie as a kid. I still love it at age 21. Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you.",9,137,193,31 December 2015
Chicken Run," Better than it should be.
","Chicken run really has what could have been a very corny, immature, and, possibly, tasteless premise, and easily have just been a very stupid, loud, colourful mess that shuts kids up. Actually, this film doesn't settle for that, it actually has a lot of intelligence, charm, subtlety, legitimately emotional scenes, and could even be quite morbid at times. This film is one I recommend to all ages. Fans of POW movies can get a kick from it, kids can enjoy it, as can anyone else. The plot is very erratic, but in a good way and keeps you guessing, until it leads to a climax you certainly won't see coming. Idealistic and natural hatched lead hen ginger, her intelligent, scatterbrained, and slightly insane Scottish assistant Mac, wise old veteran rooster fowler, muscular, loudmouthed, and cantankerous bunty, and endearingly ignorant babs hatch feckless scheme after feckless scheme, in a bid to liberate the farm's vast chicken flock. However, ginger and the gang are stopped at every turn by the callous and tyrannical Willard tweedy, and his pair of attack dogs. The farm is low on funds, and any hen who cannot produce eggs is decapitated, and eaten by the two farmers. However, a rooster, known as rocky the Rhode island red, who is capable of flight, crashed into the farm one fateful night, and has to take time to heal his broken wing, while, after threatening to return him to circus he came from by ginger, is forced against his will into verbally teaching the hens to fly. He agrees, yet harbours a dark secret. To worsen matters, the head of the farm, the highly-ambitious and Sociopathic melisha tweedy, Willard's domineering and business-minded wife, has lofty aspirations of becoming a wealthy pie-manufacturer, and without a shred of empathy, intends on turning the entire flock into pie filler. Time is ticking, and the hens MUST learn to fly, before their goose is cooked. Assisting them are two hilarious rats, nick and fetcher. Nick is intelligent and suave, fetcher is slightly unhinged and mentally distant, yet they eagerly help the hens, in exchange for seed, and if they are expected to work Harder than usual, then they demand eggs. The characters all have depth, quirks, and it is shown through their actions, not just sitting around and blabbing exposition. The animation is very aesthetic, allowing for a lot of well- timed slapstick and hilarious eggs-xpressions.",10,0,0,25 June 2017
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," too self-absorbed to connect to an audience.
","This is the worst star wars movie, and this is coming from a prequel sympathiser.The phantom menace is so bad its good, and to those of us who overlook its flaws, it is a cute, fun movie with one or two spectacular scenes. However, the attack of the clones is a long, tedious and boring movie. The dialog from anakin is absurdly weird and random. Also, anakin is creepy in this movie. He is like a deranged stalker. However, i won't lie, there are 5 good scenes in this movie, the beginning with the hover car chase, that led to the funny bar scene. anakin meeting his mom is genuinely heartwarming. and the funny and scary scene in the droid factory. and also there's a cool scene where anakin, padame, and obi-wan are made to fight 3 monsters, and it leads to a cool climatic battle.",4,1,8,9 January 2016
Clash of the Titans," Clash of the freethinkers.
","This movie is interesting. It diverges far from it's source materiel, and takes a radically different route. It ditches the whole believe and follow your parents faith, and instead toys around with some deeper concepts. Enter Perseus. Perseus has led a hard life, his adoptive family have struggled to catch enough fish to eat, and storms regularly claim people's lives. When Perseus loses his family to a storm, his disappointment for the gods becomes hatred. King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia's army finds him and brings him to their city. There, the populace has become heathens, resenting their gods and defacing the temples and statues that are devoted to them. The queen claims her daughter is prettier and more attractive than the goddess Aphrodite. Zeus's brother, the embodiment of evil and Greek equivalent to Satan, the misanthropic hades, is given permission to spread mayhem with his pet, the kracken,an immense beast with virtually no shortcomings, by Zeus, as punishment for humanity's defiance. However, if Andromeda is fed to the kracken, the monster will become pacified, and refrain from exterminating the human race. Perseus realizes that Zeus is his father, who impregnated a human. His biological mother was killed by her human husband, but not before giving birth to Perseus. Questing across the lands in a bid to find the means to defeat the kracken, Perseus frequently is offered help from his heavenly parent, yet refuses his pity. He much prefers justice and care for his fellow humans, and would rather die among them than live forever in heaven. Throughout his quest, battling many nightmarish creatures, he barely scrapes through, yet never asks for any help from the gods. His morality was above the gods who created him, and their threats and the massacres they carry out on humans never intimidate him into submitting to them. It is only later in the movie does Zeus soften up, and Perseus admit he loves him, but he never allows himself to mould his own morality around Zeus, or depend on him as a guide. Perseus doesn't even need the threat of hell and reward of mount Olympus, or heaven, to dictate who he his. He sticks to his own morality, and aspires to help his fellow humans, whether the gods approve or not. He is even offered advantages from Zeus, that would rise him above the mortal humans, yet he refuses them. This movie definitely paints freethinking in a positive light. Without needing faith, Perseus remained kind, caring, tough, brave, and well-rounded. He still learned to love the gods, and respect them, but never relied on or allowed them to dictate him. Interesting ideas stemmed from this movie. Gods being reliant on, and friendly with the very demon who punishes defiant humans, and the fact gods need prayers to survive, or they die, are not to be overlooked. Religious and atheistic people should definitely gives this one a watch.",7,1,1,3 April 2017
Jurassic World," The most action-packed entry in the series, but far less intelligent.
","OK, this movie is in the right for calling itself Jurassic world and not Jurassic park, as its tone is very different. Unlike the quiet, thoughtful, and suspense filled park series, Jurassic world is a break-neck paced action film, and the sense of wonder is also glossed over.The emotional scenes are forced, there is a rushed romance, and a shoe-horned in divorce for the mandatory children in the move.(this movie didn't really need kids in it.) It is an amazing spectacle, that has a few thrown in, rushed through 'clever' moments, and exposition, but once that's out of the way, it plunges into insane, almost cartoon-like action, with poorly rendered dinosaurs doing over-the-top-things. The effects are weird, the cgi looking real in some shots and fake in others, and the dinosaur character models look odd, as all the dinosaurs have big feet, big heads, and just look like 3-d cartoons, especially in the case of the tyrannosaurs. The only time they look real is when the brontosaurus dies as they used a robotic dinosaur. In its credit, there are some cool concepts in this movie, such as dinosaurs imprinting on people, and the new attraction, a genetically engineered hybrid created to boost popularity, has an interesting back-story, although once it breaks loose it just behaves like a generic movie monster and attacks everything in sight. It is also a nerdy nit-pick of mine, but the dinosaurs, from a scientific point of view are all hideous, deformed monstrosities, especially in the case of the small meat-eating dinosaurs which we now know possessed feathers, and had inward facing palms, not loose zombie hands.But in this movies credit, it does state the cloned dinosaurs are mixed with other animals DNA making them look different, but it would have been cooler if the park cloned purer dinosaurs resembling the real deal.But all in all, this movie is good fun, the dinosaurs have a lot of personality, are still sweet and likable, Chris Pratt is affable, Claire is basically bones from bones. The climax, which i won't give away, is amazingly over-the-top.",7,16,35,6 January 2016
