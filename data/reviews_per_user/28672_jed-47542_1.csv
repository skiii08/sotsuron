Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A bit of a disappointment
","I must say this movie was a bit of a disappointment right after coming off from seeing the original trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi). This movie did not contain enough action and was a bit more of an adventure type. In my opinion, this is by far the worst Star Wars film of all six. The character Jar Jar Binks was a little bit funny at first, but after a while he just got annoying. He was supposed to be like the new Chewbacca character which everyone was supposed to like, but that was obviously a failure. The only memorable part of the movie, in my opinion, was the lightsaber duel in the end. The movie over all seemed too childish.",5,1,4,15 May 2015
