Captain Phillips," Top draw movie, ace performances, a little more Africa back story might have helped.
","This is a very good movie. 'Movie' enough that it's enjoyable from a movie-lover's perspective, and realistic enough that you feel you've seen a fair representation of events, as much as any movie can give. Thankfully avoids the gratuitous or bloody violence that afflicts so many modern pictures, while leaving you in no doubt about the potential for extreme violence that the characters have.Tom Hanks again? Yes, but he tones down much of his characteristic affability, and is very believable as the captain of the cargo ship. (As with George Clooney in The Perfect Storm, Hanks happened to bare a strong likeness to the real captain of the ship, so was pretty much ideal.)The plot is closely based on a real hijacking of a large cargo ship off the Somali coast in 2009, and the key role of the Captain in manipulating the hard-bitten hijackers and get his ship, his crew and himself to safety ... however, events spiral out of control, thwarting both his and the hijacker's best laid plans, and other forces appear on the scene to raise the stakes even higher. It's hard to say too much without edging into spoiler territory, so if you don't know anything about the actual hijacking, I'd suggest not finding anything out beforehand to get the most from the movie, but even if you do, you won't be disappointed.The whole cast gives a pretty flawless performance, somewhere between United 93 and Zero Dark Thirty in tone. Barkhad Abdi as the cool, dedicated and desperate pirate leader is mesmerizing, and is a sure Oscar tip. The American crew give such a polished, realistic performance that you can't help placing yourself in the situation, and wondering what you'd be doing or thinking.The film is well paced, the two hours passing easily, with no spurious padding. It's simply a good movie - not a great one, but good.I say not 'great', simply because while it entertains, thrills and informs (to an extent), it didn't leaved me 'moved' afterward. I'd have personally liked to have seen more of the hijackers' back stories. I've had a number of good friends from related backgrounds (not Somalia, but Nigeria, rural Zimbabwe and township South Africa), and I think their first reaction would be, 'It's good, nice to see some realism about what some people have to cope with, but we're not all hijackers you know!'.So, to sum up: top draw movie, ace performances, a little more Africa back story might have helped.",8,0,1,3 December 2013
Lone Survivor," Brutal, realistic, drama-documentary on the reality of war in Afghanistan.
","This is a dramatization of a US mission to kill a Taliban activist in 2005, in which the four man team experience the extremes of warfare, and at the end there is a 'lone survivor'. Mixed in with this, is the experience of one of the team in a Pashtun village, where he is inexplicably sheltered from his Taliban pursuers. Can't elaborate any more without giving away some of the plot.As a war movie, it's pretty accurate-looking, although many moments are distinctly 'Hollywoodized' (particularly one of the death scenes), and the movie makers love of glamorizing explosions is often present.There is an excess of glib chat between soldiers - there would have been no harm to the accuracy of the movie in toning this down, it didn't tell me anything about the characters or plot. Mark Wahlberg's closing line, obviously something significant, was incomprehensible to me.There's a lot of padding at the beginning and end of the movie, with shots of service personnel training and other matter, which was repetitive and didn't add to the product as a movie or documentary. Also a lot of slow-motion and intrusive music score, particularly in the earlier part of the movie.So, a lot of criticism from me, but ... eight out of ten all the same, less one point because of the uneven production issues mentioned above. It's quite good, and leaves one thinking a little. Lone Survivor takes a step further than the much hyped Zero Dark Thirty, by recognizing the role of the people whose home actually is Afghanstan. This is done in a simplistic way, but then this is really a movie about soldiers doing their stuff, and how they cope (or don't) when things go wrong. Grim, but with a thankful message of hope in human nature by the end. Would have loved to have given it eight (although certainly not nine), but it's just a bit to ragged and uneven in places.",7,0,2,7 February 2014
Argo," Formulaic and historically inaccurate
","A reasonably competent movies from a technical point of view, but in other respects very misleading.What I liked was Ben's restrained performance as the CIA field operative, and fun to see John Goodman in a straight role, but everything else was a bit lacking. Iran is an extraordinary, culturally rich and diverse country, but it is portrayed as populated entirely by thugs and fundamentalists, with the rest of the population invisible or cowering victims. I'm not being an apologist for a state with poor human rights and a dictatorial government - but it is not what is portrayed in this movie.The basic fact that for a short period several American consulate workers were in hiding and were flown out under fake identities is true, but a lot is missed out. They first hid in the British consulate, but were moved to Canada House on British advice (as best as I can glean from various Internet sources), and the whole operation was a joint venture between at least three countries. What we get is a 'Yankwash.'The film-makers have said that people forget that 'this is a movie', and deliberate latitude and creativity is necessary for entertainment purposes to make it watchable and engaging. Okay, so if that is the case then what is left is formulaic: bad guys do something bad - maverick individual comes up with a daring plan - plan almost fails at the last minute - car chase - everyone alright now!I'm sorry, but I just don't buy the excuses. This is a lazy way of film- making. The more accurate story could have been well told - with acceptable dramatic liberties such as condensing number of characters, timescales and even adding the (actually never happened) car-chasing-a- jumbo-jet-bit as they finally flee - without having to rewrite history t a degree that becomes offensive.So, averagely enjoyable if it was fiction and a polished production from a acting and technical point of view, but a desperately inaccurate pastiche of what really happened - a great shame as the real story would have been just as good, if not better for being real.",2,301,405,9 December 2012
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Good in parts, but overblown CGI effects and lack of empathy ruins it.
","It had good parts. I enjoyed Martin Freeman's performance in the earlier part of the movie, and the earlier part of the movie in general - because it did play to human interest, but this rapidly evaporated.CGI very much took over as the movie went on, and on an overwhelming scale. It's like watch an action movie with lots of explosions - after so many one ceases to care any more. There was also a lack of reality (yes, I know it is fantasy!). If a character can harmed by a sword cut then they definitely wouldn't survive multiple falls down cliff faces and into bottomless chasms.On many occasions the CGI just didn't look right. Gollum, when he appeared, reminded me more of a TV commercial character in the way every second was filled with a movement or facial expression. Likewise with some other characters. 10/10 for effort - this is close to as good as it gets - there is just far, far too much. The canvas is very overworked.Lastly, too much dialog. Characters rarely stopped jabbering, and it didn't do anything for me in adding enjoyment or plot development.Sorry, but I just didn't buy this. To balance things out, not a 'bad' movie - I'd happily watch it again, perhaps two or three times, but ultimately forgettable. My wife, incidentally, liked it, and the twelve year old neighbors daughter we took loved it!",3,4,9,10 January 2013
Frozen," Fun(ish), forgettable, Disney fantasy. Won't bore you, but won't change your life!
","This is Disney at it's simplest and surest - a plain and fun fantasy about a princess with magical powers, a handsome prince, a couple of goofy characters to provide regular light relief, and a couple of really mean villeins, of course.Very 'Disney' in it's values - the family is no. 1, good people are beautiful and young, bad people typically ugly, old and have eastern European accents, animals are cute. Actually, the film does break a couple of these rules, but one is very conscious that this is Disneytopia, right down to the emotional manipulation and total lack of depth to any character. Yes, I know it's a kids movie, but all the same ...Pros: passes the time and gives some smiles, although no big laughs for the adults, or for the children really.Cons: animation is a little lacking - TV rather than big-screen quality much of the time. Also, there is a LOT of singing, and nothing particularly memorable! (E.g., 'Something, something ... let's build a snowman, ... something.') I'd have preferred a bit more goofing around with the fun characters.Overall: my wife and I saw it on a Sunday evening with a lot of young children in the cinema - not a lot of reaction from them, while it held the attention, would have like to have heard more laughter. Definitely a middling 7/10 from me. Spend an afternoon at the mall for the same (or less) amount of money and have more fun.",7,5,9,8 December 2013
Lincoln," Thoughtful drama with stunning performances - utterly believable
","I really enjoyed this movie. I knew nothing about it beforehand, not even who directed it, and failed to recognize Daniel Day Lewis as the lead actor. It came across as an excellently-scripted period political drama, and left me feeling that I had seen something special.Surprised to discover that I had watched a Spielberg movie. It didn't have what I'd describe as the usual Spielberg schmaltzy pathos and fall-back on playing emotional games with the audience.As a biographical work I think it is good, painting a portrait of the man by focusing on his thoughts and action in a short period of time, rather than trying to tell his life story.I don't know if the facts of Lincoln's manipulation of political events is correct, but the spirit of the film seems true to the little I know of Lincoln from his own writings.The beginning of the movie isn't great in my opinion - too dependent on trying to immediately impress the audience I felt - and it then changes tack into complex political discussion. Don't give up to early, as it does drag at times. It all comes together later on and gives a real feel for what the characters must have experienced in real events.Good movie. Lost a point for its uneven beginning, otherwise can't really fault it.",8,1,2,31 December 2012
Zero Dark Thirty," Polished production, very watchable out of curiosity, but ultimately dull and vacuous.
","Three out of ten might seem a bit mean, but it reflects my overall view after watching the movie twice. I just found it left a vacuum. The narrative tension was weak, and dependent on spaghetti western tactics of having a few gunshots or explosions every now and then to keep the audience interested. Jessica was entertainingly intense, but the rest of the ensemble gave middling, safe performances.Bigelow directs well, but only in the sense of giving a professional, technically polished production. Where's the emotion and human involvement? It'll keep you watching and you won't be bored, but I suspect this will rapidly fade in movie-goer consciousness once the hype dies down.",3,15,32,31 January 2013
Thirteen Days," Good TV drama with well-directed dramatic tension and some fine performances ... and Kevin Cosner
","A good movie, with some excellent performances. Bruce Greenwood is utterly believable as President Kennedy and was a bit of inspired casting, and Steven Culp makes an excellent Bobby Kennedy. The latter's performance deserves special mention, I feel, as Culp is otherwise a relative unknown, someone who has a long list of walk on parts in numerous TV series from The Cosby Show to Grey's Anatomy, yet is not exactly a familiar name or face.As a drama it is enjoyable to follow and achieves real dramatic tension during critical moments, which is a tricky act to pull off in any story when one already knows the end (if not, Google 'Cuban Missile Crisis'!)I was not left with an impression of having watched a high end movie, it left more of an impression of a high quality TV drama-documentary. In short I liked it! It kept my attention all the way through, and I'm someone who easily loses interest if I feel the quality of a movie is becoming suspect, or it is simply boringly told.Kevin Costner ... his performance is good, I suppose, but ... what is it about the man? Towards the end of the movie I get the feeling he's trying to steal the show. He simply a presidential adviser, but as the political tensions escalate I feel Cosner is forgetting that the movie is not about him, but about Kennedy, nucleur missiles and a key moment in world diplomatic history. He should stayed in the background and trusted the abilities of Greenwood, etc. to carry the drama to its conclusion.Or maybe this criticism should really be directed at the writers or director. However, maybe I'm overdoing the criticism. Costner's a big name. If he'd been an unknown in his first movie I'd be praising he to the heavens.All-in-all a movie I'd recommend to a friend as a memorable drama which will leave a good impression and even educate one a little bit.",7,0,1,18 February 2013
