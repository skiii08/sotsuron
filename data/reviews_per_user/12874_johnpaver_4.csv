The Blair Witch Project," Yawn.
","This film is not even slightly scary. It's not even slightly interesting. From the reaction of everybody else in the cinema, I was not alone in finding this film to be a complete waste of two hours and Â£4.50.Do yourself a favour and avoid it!",1,15,29,28 June 2002
Independence Day," This is the worst film I've ever seen. Avoid it!
","The basic plot (Martians invade the Earth) is as old as the hills and was much better done in the 50's film 'War of the Worlds' and the more recent 'Mars Attacks'. Other than this, 'Independence Day' has no plot.It has very little else. There is no plot development, no character development, no tension, nothing! I was hoping that the Martians would win in the first 10 minutes so that this appalling film would end.Alas, this is a very long and boring film. What it does have in abundance is very bad acting and awful dialogue. See 'Mars Attacks' instead!",1,5,9,30 December 2001
Pi," Good but not original.
","The plot is not as original as many reviewers seem to think. After 10 minutes I found myself wondering if the screenplay had been based loosely on Umberto Eco's 'Foucault's Pendulum' (which was published around 1990). As the film went on I became more and more convinced I was right.Anyway, this is an interesting film but not to most people's taste I suspect (if you like crap such as 'Independence Day' and buddy cop films then give 'Pi' a miss!). I did find the use of monochrome film very pretentious!
I wouldn't call this 'Sci-Fi' but then that's not the film's fault.If you enjoyed this film then I recommend you read 'Foucault's Pendulum'.9/10 including 2 bonus points for not being predictable boring crap like 99.999% of the rubbish Hollywood churns out.",9,0,1,24 February 2002
Where Eagles Dare," Superb Action Entertainment
","I feel that a large number of reviewers are completely missing the purpose of this film.Why do we watch films? Because we want to be entertained!Does it matter if several thousand heavily armed German soldiers cannot shoot the side of a barn? Who cares if helicopters hadn't been invented? Does it really matter that Richard Burton has a bottomless bag of explosives and barely flinches when he gets shot? (I laughed until it hurt when he merely wrapped a hankie round his hand and carried on as if nothing had happened!).This film sets out to entertain and it succeeds brilliantly. The music is superb and the acting is appropriately hammy (especially from the Gestapo officer complete with comedy accent).I have yet to see a film which is remotely realistic and I'd like to keep it that way!10 out of 10.
Also recommended: 'Fear Is The Key'; 'Book of Life', and 'Sons of the Desert'.",10,3,4,19 January 2002
