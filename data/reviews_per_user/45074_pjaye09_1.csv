Sucker Punch," A Visual Masterclass
","- I love Zack Snyder's work; it is purely a sensory experience. He's heard about acting & understands that the characters in his pieces need to pull funny faces as they deliver their lines, but has never let it get in the way of his vision. For some people that's a bad thing, they however do not appreciate that as an art form cinema has room his acting light style & is enriched by it.If I was to compare his work to a style of painting it would be the Baroque with its rich pallet & lavish use of contrast, but that comparison is not a good one. Firstly he puts more depth & perspective into his frames than most 3D films can manage. He then rounds out his digital labours with a perfect union of sound & movement. I would, as a side note, suggest that Mr Snyder spend a little time with a mental health professional who specialises in the area of non- consensual lovemaking, because after playing out his guilt laden rape fantasies to the public in Three films now, they don't seem to be in any way resolved.Now for the future, I say bring on Superman. Though I would give a little warning to the poor actress being lined up to play Lois Lane as it's far more likely that Zacky boys General Zod's idea of putting her in peril will be cornering her in a dark alley & bashing her back doors in!",8,1,5,2 April 2011
