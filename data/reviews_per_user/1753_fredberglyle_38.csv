Despicable Me 2," Quite un-DESPICABLE in some aspects.
","This is the third movie I watched with my little niece (after TS 3 and Barbie). Gru is back with his little girls and the minions to entertain us again. Only this time as a hero and a kind hearted father. Good job by the animation department to provide eye-popping visuals with lots of colorful characters and none could match the minions (my niece enjoyed them too well). The movements of all characters are detailed enough. I loved the orange haired Lucy and El Macho. I couldn't resist my laughter at the scene in which El Macho fakes death. There's a whole lot of comic elements in the movie. The villain's characterization was bad, imo. I hated the minions appearing very frequently and not all scenes of them are lols as in the first. They get annoying after sometime (for adults at least). The script could've been a little better at least with the villain.",6,0,0,12 November 2013
Captain Phillips," Captain Philips takes the front seat at the academy
","The movie features true events occurred in 2009 in a Cargo ship. Tom Hanks plays the role of Cap. Philips and no one needs a mention about his acting. The other actor named Berkhad Abdi plays a villain in this movie and by God he is superb (Oscar deserving) and times felt like me going into the theater screen to kill 'm (lol). There is a hijacking segment in the movie first-half which was thrilling (a nail biter). The second half was too thrilling as the first but was more predictable. The technical departments like sound and editing are way too good with a well written screenplay (Oscar deserving again). The bottom line : A Saturday night watch with family (No sex/nudity, little violence).",7,3,6,18 January 2014
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," A well crafted coming-of-age drama by 'Chobosky'...
","Just seen this very good movie and I know its very late. Couldn't get it out of my head. IMO, a well scripted drama, inspired from novel. The movie features three main teen characters, but it isn't an ordinary teen movie. 'Charlie' character reminds me of the young man from 'ordinary people (1980)', which also features three main characters but not teens. The songs (OSTs) from the movie are cool too. A Special mention to 'Come on Eileen' ('OMG, they are playing good music... living room routine') and 'heroes' make the viewers to enjoy the movie better. Sad thing that this movie didn't fall upon the eyes of the academy. STILL IT IS INFINITE!",8,0,0,20 July 2013
Gravity," GRAVITY - Castaway in space
","The technicality is terrific. A visual treat from space with a sound department deserving an Oscar. Awesome cinematography that could take viewing to a new level with absolutely no cuts. Nice direction with just two lead characters throughout the entire film.Seriously was shocked to be listed among the top Oscar nominees and could possibly bag many. It was because the movie story was a direct-lift from Castaway except for the fact that the protagonist is lost in space instead of an island. A very shallow script that no one could possibly discuss after viewing. Also the movie has too many sci errors like the oxygen levels in a suite (see it you'll understand).Pros - Special Effects, sound, Camera-work. Cons - Predictable after the first 20 minutes, clichÃ©s and errors, hollow script.",7,1,4,1 March 2014
The Hunger Games," THE HUNGER GAMES - Loosing game
",The movie idea was great and the screenplay could be very far better. The idea is basically a copy of a 1987's Arnold's English movie and another foreign movie. There were some exciting movie sets which is one positive for this film and the other being the acting (esp. Jennifer). The CGI shots were not upto the standards. There were few movies I couldn't cherish because of shaky camera and this is no exception and at one point I forwarded the action scenes. I had a headache after watching this one and the plot was totally non-practical.The bottom line : Highly predictable action flick aimed utmost for teen-agers.,5,1,3,29 May 2014
Ted," TED - Rated R-aunchy R-acist R-idiculous guy
","The movie is comedy/fantasy. Still it is highly un-recommended for children because of lots of profane comedy phrases. Seth Mc Farlane, 'family guy' guy stole the acting (for Ted character) show. Yet his direction falls short, imo. I give my stars for the music department and the songs were cool. Parts of the movie were boring and few jokes were offensive (like beating a Jewish kid and blaming Indians for 9/11). The animation department worked well with Ted's animation. The emotions/ sentiments were ultra-reduced, which actually spoiled the movie's soul (i.e.. there wasn't even a full emotional scene between main characters that lasted over a minute). The movie was totally unexpected from Mc Farlane. I expected less vulgar, less boring and decent comedy.",5,1,2,1 April 2014
The Others," THE OTHERS gave me chills...
","Fear of dark is typical in horror flicks, but here its fear of light for Anne & Nicholas. In fact there is a peculiar condition for children in this film (Anne & Nicholas), that they are photosensitive. This is one of those movies which the viewers must never know the suspense/spoilers for thrills. So before you watch this, don't read any reviews with spoilers. The movie is a horror/thriller so its meant to be scary but didn't scare me. The sounds (sound effects) gave me jerk for I've watched it with surround sounds late at night. Just like a typical suspense movie, it can be watched once as the second time you wouldn't. Except for frightening scenes the movie has no sexuality nor profanity nor violence. The bottom line : Another good film to watch on a stormy night all alone with good sound effects and big screen (without reading spoilers and unless you have a weak heart to withstand horror)",7,1,3,25 May 2014
Zodiac," ZODIAC - riveting 'mega'-serial killer
","A mega-serial killer because of the years he(Zodiac) escaped from the cops, the topic was hot for many years and for the length of the movie (nearly 3 hours). Yes, I feel the movie got a bit long. Still liked it for the fact that I've seen some real unsolved case taken as movie for the first time. The murder scene at a public park was my favorite as it was so so real and riveting. The issue I had is the script doesn't properly connect Zodiac and the main characters psychologically and so felt boring at parts. Must admit that I had huge hopes for the director who gave movies like Fight Club and Seven and this falls short. The movie is recommended for those interested in serial killer movies with lot of free time to watch.",7,1,1,22 May 2014
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag' runs for bollywood's Gold
","One of the best Indian biopic and a movie to remember the Flying Sikh. Times in the movie felt like I'm seeing Hollywood stuff. A very motivational movie. Director who gave blockbuster RDB has done a good job again. Shankar Ehsaan's music was fine. Australian country song in Punjabi style and the inspirational score of 'Thu hai aag Milka' are such a treat to the ears. Actors did a fine job. Farhan was superb and almost looked transformed himself into the character. Sonam had too little role to offer.In spite of all positives, the film contains a lot of fictional elements along with facts (e.g..., a guy breaking some record with wounded feet and other guy drinking 2 cans of ghee and doing 100 push-ups. which is typical bollywoodish and unreal). The bottom-line is: Apart from few fictional scenes ,a must watch for all Indians (PG for below 12 years) as it is motivational and reminds us of our country's greatest athlete.",8,0,0,13 November 2013
Pacific Rim," Beneath Pacific rests our greatest enemy.
","A visual treat, I must say and a fairly good movie. Seriously I expected something bigger from the director who made me believe that fairy tales could be serious in Pan's Labyrinth. The movie certainly is bigger technically but falls behind novelty. Everybody has known transformers, battleship etc.., and not again with this combats. I've seen these animated combats way before in 1998 when I played metal fatigue game. Actors did a fair job sailing along the script and I disagree with the other reviewer who was telling that actors were bad. The first 10 minutes was excellent and I felt like 'm gonna see something like District 9 but the movie lost pace in the middle and got highly predictable (something like a lunch with a good soup and a bad main course). The bottom line is that the movie is visually appealing with nicely written dialogs to match but falls behind any new essence.",7,5,7,31 October 2013
American Hustle," American HUSTLE - Not much excitement because of too many inspirations
","A fine plot set in 1970s. To add more of the 70s mood, the director drew his inspiration from Scorsese, and Christian Bale copied De Niro. There are 10 nominations for the film at the academy on Sunday in which 4 nominations for the actors who did main characters. Being a huge fan of 70s-80s movies I personally felt the flavor of films like Godfather, The Sting and of course The Goodfellas (almost a re-take on its screenplay). It was entertaining to listen to songs like Yellow brick road by Sir. Elton, I feel love by Donna, Live and let die etc. in number of scenes.The bottom line a great half fiction/half fact movie to watch (Not with Kids due to s**ualty/nudity and drug use) with shortcomings of its own.",7,0,3,1 March 2014
The Godfather: Part II," Best Se(pre)quel movie ever
","'Its like sayin' that you have the recipe of Coca-Cola but you wouldn't make another bottle' Mario Puzo said this when Francis Coppola refused to make this movie. The initial scene in this movie was inspired by many movies, which I'd refuse to disclose to avoid spoilers. Even these days we find a Part -2 of a movie would feature a similar screenplay but this isn't the case in Godfather 2 movie. It is both a sequel and a prequel of the first . It shows what happens before Godfather part-1 and what happens after. Robert Niro's role as the vibrant young Vito matches Brando's' Don Vito in the first. I would suggest the movie lovers to watch after GF part 1 so as to understand the characters better . Also I highly recommend to watch both completes this epic.",9,1,4,28 July 2013
Rush," Adrenaline RUSH: Apt Formula
","Racy fast screenplay like an F1 car. Couldn't believe that I've watched a 2 hour long movie. One of the strongest contenders for movie awards. The two main characters were represented superbly by Hemsworth and Bruhl (esp. I cherished their voices and slang). Academy is too bad of not nominating Bruhl for his role in the movie for he was superb.Professional egotism, rivalry and F1 races are nothing short of reality in this. Period tones, fashions and sfx are mind-blowing. The only problem in the whole movie could be with sport violence and few sex/ nude scenes. This movie did teach me two things and they are: good rivals could become good friends and good rivalry in profession help us to improve our career.",8,2,2,23 January 2014
Burn After Reading," Don't 'Burn After Reading'...
","OK, the Coen brothers have given another black comedy with great characters definitely. But come on, how different is this movie from their former movies? The same old game with humor elements in it like Lebowski, Intolerable cruelty etc. still couldn't get anywhere near Lebowski because of poor characterization, in my humble opinion. No character is typically likable in this. The positives in this movie would include dark humor esp by Clooney but still not enough laughs. The bottom line is -- worth watching once but don't even think of burning a disk/ getting a copy after renting this movie. You may even hate Coen brothers after watching this one.",5,0,1,11 August 2013
Man of Steel," Steel galvanized by Snyder and Nolan is too rusty
","The movie Man of Steel is an action packed super-hero movie and is better than superman returns. The visuals are just superb esp. the fight between Gn. Zod and the hero. The characterization is too serious I feel. Also not much humor content in the movie but I don't think anyone would want humor in a movie like this. The first hour gives the viewers something like a Nolan's touch with graphic display of the director and I pretty well enjoyed it. I have been watching Super man movies, cartoons and reading comics since the year I was born. This movie contradicts almost everything with what I've seen or read. Like superman getting his people killed while he could've taken the villain to a no man's land, a new meaning to letter S, him trusting a total stranger's words as his father and this list goes on. The worst part is that he sees one of the family member dying in a hurricane and does nothing.",6,0,4,5 November 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," THE GIRL WITH DRAGON Tattoo seduced me
","I've heard from sources that a person cannot resist three things and one of them is 'attraction to opposite sex'. The girl with Dragon tattoo (ie.. Rooney Mara) attracts the viewers and no wonder she received Oscar for it. I enjoyed the way she acted as a shy, yet as a bold girl with a disturbed mind and also a smart and intelligent detective. Another feature I loved is the cinematography, the Sweedish winter is such a sight and of course the scenic beauty of the same. Daniel Craig was good too in his role of Mikhel and I enjoyed Plummer and Skarsgard in their roles as well.Now the cons of the movie. The only problem is the 'Remake' factor. If you've watched the original movie then you may hate it. The original Sweedish movie is too perfect to be remade. Naomi may be far better than Mara but you must appreciate the efforts of Mara for her role.",7,3,5,25 May 2014
The Machinist," THE MACHINIST is/makes you sleepless
","I felt like a 21st century revisit to my all-time favorite thriller film director Hitchcock's Psycho, Vertigo etc. Christian Bale was awesome in the film with a skinny appearance that puts you spellbound. He plays the lead character who suffers from insomnia. I found extremely disturbing seeing him in this state. I must credit the movie makers for the wonderful dark setting to the movie. The movie is so upsetting (because of tragic theme) so not recommended for the commercial movie goers and surly not for younger audiences. I loved the way the suspense unfolds at the movie end. Must admit that I watched it at night and was sleepless just like the machinist in this film, so be warned.I'd recommend the film to serious movie watchers who are interested to see a character development and appreciates the dark setting to a thriller movie.",7,0,0,8 May 2014
The Lego Movie," THE LEGO MOVIE – goofy for kids and nostalgic for adults
","I remember playing with brick toys in childhood days. We make different shapes with it, starting from a toy-bird to a building or an airplane. All the animated characters in the movie are based on these brick toys made by the company. The imagination level of this movie-maker is way up high and I couldn't resist humor in some scenes. There are number of memorable characters such as good-cop/bad-cop, wild-style, Vitruvius, Unikitty and 'special'. The batman, superman, Gandalf, Green lantern and Dumberldore were cool too. No wonder the movie got award for best innovative advertising for its cool. The movie features very mild crude jokes that may just require PG. The coolest thing about the movie is the message – Having free will.",8,0,1,2 August 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Join DALLAS BUYER's CLUB for McCon & Leto
","Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto gave phenomenal performances that'd already fetched various awards for this movie. They might just fetch a double Oscar this coming week (Matt must win an Oscar at least for his 40 pound weight loss and 'I like your style, doc'). . I must add the credit to the camera person which adds right essence to the movie (esp. the butterfly scene).The script could have been elaborated considering the movie theme with some of the finest acting by the players. It also looses pace near the climax drifting towards politics. The bottom line : RESTRICTED for KIDS due to Nudity, abusive phrases and excessive drug use. A must view for all mature audience to watch the two lead actors.",7,0,2,24 February 2014
Underground," Was a different experience watchin' UNDERGROUND
","Kusturica takes his imagination to the brink, by giving the audience a dark- humor at the WWII. No wonder the movie had won the Palme D'or at Cannes. I didn't have the knowledge of the history or the political piece in the movie but still the story is screen played in a very different, still understandable manner. Felt boring at parts like the song and long-dance sequence and that comedy slap-sticks parts within. Still must admit that i broke to laugh at other parts and music was a treat. An emotional ending with a tint of obscure comedy does give a perfect cover to the script. I loved the liner which translates to 'No war is a war until a brother kills a brother' towards the movie end. The bottom line : A different kind of crude humor (slightly boring at parts), wickedly satirical, emotional movie.",8,2,4,22 March 2014
Mamma Mia!," MAMMA MIA - Thank ABBA for the music
","When I was young, my parents told me that they need Abba's songs to be played to feed me all three times a day. I'm still a big fan of Abba. The movie features 22 songs of Abba. Few of my favorite songs weren't there but still this movie features many others. Thanks to the actors Meryl, Brosnan, Firth and Stellan who re-sung these classic songs. Meryl was particularly good in that and I felt the voice of an Abba within her (my opinion). The movie was very joyful from start to finish and made my mind relaxed because of the magic of Abba. The movie location in Greece was like a summer fantasy.If you're watching it as a serious movie watcher then you may have these problems. One with women (of all ages) screaming in a number of scenes. Brosnan could've worked on his voice better and so many actors' voices. The plot line without such great songs would be certainly be horrible. The songs could have been choreographed better. Having such great actors, the script could've been far better.",6,1,1,13 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," HOBBIT DOS: Desolation of the novel, yet feast upon CGI
","Nothing short of a good visual treat with impressive movie set-design again from the director who brought one of the finest trilogy with the crew of over 800 in LOTR-ROTK. Initially it was said that Guillermo del Toro would direct this movie. But finally it came to Peter Jackson. A decent story, yet deviated too much from the novel and since its neither the first nor the final part of the trilogy, there ain't expectation of an ending to the story. There are too much action scenes and times I felt like the team aimed to show off their CGI stuffs and for the Video game consoles.My review for this movie is that it is adventurous with awesome camera work with CGI but too much deviated from the novel. My stars are just for the special effects and the actors and not for story.",6,4,5,25 March 2014
Before Sunset," watch BEFORE SUNSET(s)...
","'As we grow old we appreciate things more' is one of the movie's dialogs. I'm starting to like this trilogy since 'before sunrise' (which I saw many years back). The first part of the story is about two people who just meet on a train in Vienna. They meet after 10 years in a Paris library in this movie. Some profane lines in between, as the movie is wholly a conversation between two opposite sex adults. I felt there wasn't much of back-ground music in this. Still there are number of songs which are nice. The movie too gets boring after a while, still happy it is just for 80 minutes. The bottom line : Like a typical adult male fantasy to meet a nice girl traveling, still I feel a tiny-bit yawning.",7,0,0,10 April 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Grand Budapest Hotel owned by Ralph Fiennes
","There is a major degree of uniqueness with exotic visuals in the presentation of this movie. Makeup and costumes were way too fine. Tilda's makeup as an old woman was my favorite. There are loads of black humor. The cast is rich with big names ( such as William Dafoe, Adrian Brody, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Murray Abby etc) and Ralph Fiennes owned the movie show. He was fine with comedy and most of the part he reminded me of Steve Martin from Pink Panther.The negatives: The major problem that any non -European (like me) would face watching the movie is the sarcasm-comedy which are traditional French or Italian mostly. Few explicit comic scenes deserved laughs but others were rotten. The music could've been better.The movie-theme reminded me of the Grand Hotel movie in 1931.",7,2,4,28 June 2014
Revolutionary Road," REVOLUTIONARY ROAD is too submissive
",Fine acting by Leonard d' Capri and Kate Winslet that deserved applause in most scenes. Kate definitely deserved the Golden Globe. Good 1950s setup by the movie team and made me remember some good-old black and white movies of that time. The movie was realistic. I don't personally find enough revolution on the road taken by the director for this romance-drama. No definite plot for this movie something like 'sex' followed by 'smoking' followed by 'swearing' followed by 'drinking' followed by 'hate' followed by 'despair' etc. . Dialogue was much painful but hidden with some good delivery by the lead stars.,5,1,2,7 August 2013
Frozen," FROZEN at the music and animation
","Highly recommended for kids. 'Let it Go' song makers should be awarded an Oscar. Stood frozen watching the movie because of the stunning visuals and sets. Brave's princess Merida is shown as doll. Rapunzel and Flynn (from Wreck it Ralph!) too make cameos. An enjoyable movie for a man of my age too (I'm 30). The story is decent, filled with comical elements and emotions to my taste.The movie is highly predictable (quite common for a Disney cartoon or any) and was messy at some parts. Haven't seen the snow queen movie (which was the movie's prime inspiration), yet I could predict what could happen next in the movie. In spite of these shortcomings , I feel this movie is Oscar deserving for bringing back the long-lost Disney's classic and the song. If you are a Disney's admirer then Watch it now esp. with the kids.Let it Go... Let it Go... Let the soothing music and classy animation freeze you for one and half hours...",7,2,4,27 February 2014
P.S. I Love You," P.S I Love the movie
","Fell in love with the movie that brings you the harsh reality of life. Before watching the movie I personally didn't like the lead casts but the on screen chemistry between Swank and Butler is good. The soundtrack is cool. A special mention to 'Fairytale of New York' song played at the start (Lyrics not suitable for children). Even though the movie carried some comic scenes, it is sentimental in most parts which are lovable, in my opinion. It is difficult to see characters in Hollywood like Holly who is a loyal wife to Gerry. The conversation between the mother and the daughter at the end is my favorite part. Must appreciate the camera shots in Ireland and were good. The bottom line : many of you who read the review may not agree with my ratings but this one is heartwarming and you can watch it once with your loved ones.",7,1,1,21 August 2013
Evil Dead," Evil Dead - The most hilariously funny film you will ever experience
","I watched last night because of the tag-line 'The most terrifying film you will ever experience' and was rather upset with its genre. A comedy would be apt. Not one scene scared me. Sure the movie is filled with ultra-violence and lot of blood flows, which I believe is not that necessary. The story is as old as the sky and the original one by Rami is a classic horror. Don't know if I'm the only one who felt laughing to most scenes (esp. in the scene where a man slips on a severed tongue and falls head-down upon a WC). The bottom line is that this movie is one of the most hilariously funny film I've ever seen till today. I truly agree with the review the other reviewer has given -- 'If you get a chance to kill the director then do so'",3,2,7,23 September 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Fine One and half hour stay at Hotel Transylvania
","The plot is unique that shows Count Dracula as the hero and humans bad. Reminds me of very few movies like Ferngully and Cannibal Holocaust that too shows humans as villains. Movie brought a good message and quite decent for children to view. Great voice by the characters and fine visuals throughout the movie. The Character designs were so good with good animation that could make children scream 'awwo!' at the monsters. The bottom line is that, except from being predictable and it must be for children, I enjoyed watching all other aspects of the movie with my 3 year old niece and it did bring out the child within me.",7,1,4,4 February 2014
Departures," Departures
","The film on Japanese traditions and rituals followed on a funeral serves as a timeless classic. The lead actor looks adorable. All characters are lovable. Music is heavenly and takes you into a deep love for the movie. Three B's (Bach, Beethovan, Brahms) add three B's (Beauty, Brain,Brawn) to the music. No wonder academy has picked the movie. The only problem is that the movie became predictable after one hour, after he picks the job. Also it is a bit unrealistic for a musician who just lost his job, to stay with a funeral job and not look for a music job. Apart from these super-realism still I love this move which doesn't get too melodramatic in sentimental parts with a fine coating of comedy at the beginning.",8,0,0,11 April 2014
12 Years a Slave," 12 YEARS A SLAVE - master at the academy
","The movie which won Oscar for the best picture, is certainly the best picture for the year. Having watched all the nominated movies for Best director category, the academy should've given award to Steve McQueen too for this emotional pre-Civil war movie, IMO. Still the academy awarded the movie for the awesome screenplay. Lupita (the girl who won Oscar for the supporting actress), was too good esp. with the sobbing and torture scenes (made me cry almost). I detested Tarantino's Django, but now I feel like I may like it after seeing this.Somehow I could relate this movie to an Indian (Tamil language) movie named Paradisi released in earlier 2013. Both of these movies deals with slavery and the protagonist falling into it (not by his own will). In Both, the protagonist is separated from his wife and children without their knowledge. Since I am an Indian and have seen the regional movie before this. So I couldn't give it a full 10/10.Bottom line : A must-see movie. Not for kids for torture and nude scenes. Not for sensitive audiences too.",8,4,7,3 March 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," THE WOLF OF WALL STREET - A Scorseseian product like Goodfellas and Casino
","The movie breaks the record for number of f-words (506 in number). So true you can expect for a Scorsese's movie. Leonard gives the best performance in his career. Matt Mc and Dujardin are brief and are superb. Jonah Hill was very good. This 3 hour movie is filled with so much energy and comedy dialogs (of course with profanity). As other Scorsese's films, there is a whole lot of description on drugs. There were three major comedy scenes that were hilarious. Few others were forced. Pros : Strong acting, direction and screenplay. Cons : Too much xxx orgy, excessive drugs and profanity. Some bad humor.In short, the movie is recommended for fans of Scorsese. For others: don't waste your time on this!!",8,2,3,26 March 2014
Thor: The Dark World," THOR is powerless at the dark world
","Okay, so another Marvel comic flick. The sequel of 2011 Thor movie and the avengers. Would serve as a prequel to next Avengers movie. A super-hero movie about the demi-god, his brother Loki, his father Odin and the Asgardians. And yes, the audience get to see Jane (played by Portman), doctor Selvig and friends from London. The movie contains lot of special effects that are good esp. the fight scene at the climax. Loki was better among the main characters in this movie, while others here are bad. The villain Kurse was cool. All the other characters are so much under-developed and superficial. The script could've been way better. The teleport scene was a disappointment. Except for CGI, I disliked the entire movie. Still watchable just once, if you are a die-hard marvel comic fan.",5,0,0,13 April 2014
Pitch Perfect," PITCH PERFECT music is a-ca-dorable but movie a-ca-in't
","An aca-musical treat to the ears. A whole list of acapellas made from songs like Don't you forget, the sign , eternal flame, Spin my head, S&M, Like a Virgin, just the way you are, price tag etc.. Apart from these I was jubilant to listen to acapellas of 500 miles and Final Countdown. 'Cups' song took me spellbound. Among the actors I pick Fat Amy's Character, who hit the correct aca-note every time on screen. On the aca-negative part, I couldn't believe myself of viewing the movie for a-ca-lmost 2 hours because of aca-amazing songs but still sucked at multiple aca-levels. Comical elements are rusted and seen many time before in earlier movies. I hated the makeup, they were too unreal and all female actors looked like Barbie dolls. Still, bet the music is a treasure for musical lovers.",6,0,2,27 November 2013
Her," I watched HER... I loved HER...
","Love with an OS sounds insane but love itself is a socially accepted insanity. Those were the words the director said through this movie. The screenplay is an Oscar winning formula (glad if the Oscar will be given to Spike Jonze, this Sunday). The director shown a lot of empty streets and the protagonist being lonely in most parts of the movie, just so the viewers get into the movie's tone. The music is soothing and special mention to the memorable 'moon song'. This emotional romance between the man and machine was well supported by good art-direction and set design. The movie kept me interesting in most parts yet there were few monotonous ones too. The cyber-s** scenes was my only disliking part. The movie contains profane phrases and one nude scene. The bottom line : Do watch HER. You'll like HER.",8,0,1,26 February 2014
The Wedding Singer," Songs, comedy and Buscemi saves the wedding singer
",A good movie to watch with a girlfriend. Drew Barrymore is cute looking and the on screen chemistry between Sandler and her is good. Sandler was funny in this he takes us back to 80's and is one of his best. His incredible take on Madonna's Holiday song is a lol.The movie features lot of 80's sound-tracks that are pleasing to the ears and makes you to watch again and again. Boy George's with a fetish for 'Do You Really Want To Hurt Me' never fails to make the viewers laugh. The plot is original and straight.My favorite part is the first 10 minutes where you have the amazing title song and the famous Buscemi's scene ('Hey you're d wedding singer... wahoo!').,6,3,6,11 October 2013
Goodfellas," GOODFELLAS make a memorable Gangster movie
","If there is a movie with 'goodfellas' like De Niro and Pesci directed by Scorsese then you shouldn't miss out. This with the Godfather movie were two best gangster movies of all times and they both are based on Sicilian-Americans. The iconic Italinan-kind-of-narrative-screenplay does the trick for Scorsese again. The characters Jimmy, Henry,Tommy and Paulie are memorable and defined perfectly by the director. Joe Pesci was the best among in this movie as he is funny and short-tempered at the same time and no wonder academy recognized his performance. The script was like a double-edged sword that made this movie so memorable.",10,1,2,31 May 2014
The Godfather," THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies...
","THE GODFATHER of all Gangster movies is an understatement for the line 'THE GODFATHER of all movies'. You won't miss any element of a great movie in this. Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.",10,2,5,22 July 2013
