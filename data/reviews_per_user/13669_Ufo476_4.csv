Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I couldn't believe they made it this good!
","When the original trilogy came out, it totally amazed me. Although I didn't find everything perfect- certain things could have evolved differently etc, these movies got imprinted in me and my imagination. They were bright, innovative, artistic, had an atmosphere of devoutness and awe, and in a lot of ways represented things scarce in our world: Beauty, innocence, clear distinction between 'good' and 'evil', along an entire versatile universe, likable characters, imaginative scenery, compelling and tense story and a lot more. In some ways, I think, they inspired me as a person- and this capability, to inspire beyond simply entertaining, is a trait of many great movies arguably but rarely accomplished by SF! In any case, they were a point of reference to me- an almost perfect sample of fantasy/science fiction. Thankfully, a lot of people in the world felt the same!However, when episode I came out I was reluctant to see it. A lot of films which are produced considerably after their original (sequels, prequels, remakes etc), have a tendency to loose their innocence or their spirit, to become more vulgar, commercial, more standardized, more 'common' than their original counterparts and since 'Star Wars' still held an iconic place in my imagination, I didn't want anything to spoil the image I had of them! Gratefully, when I actually did see 'episode 1', I found out it had retained exactly its initial brightness, beauty and spirit! The fact it was created by George Lucas, whose life is connected to 'Star Wars', is obviously related! JL handled the task of creating the saga's prequel while maintaining its feel with the utmost care- and it paid off! Because without loosing the original atmosphere, it delivers a compelling story that lays the ground for everything to follow. The backbone of course is the fight for freedom of an innocent planet against a greedy federation, similar although in scale to the future battle of the entire galaxy (every major process has a start!), but if you look closely, the events there (SPOILERS: especially concerning 'Palpatine') have an absolute connection to the route to 'Empire'. In effect, continuity is the stronger card of this movie. What happens here fits perfectly with what will come! Unlike other franchises like Star Trek and Xmen, with tons of plot-holes between prequels and sequels, things here actually make sense! For instance, the Senate is corrupt and run from bureaucrats - and reasonably so, you can't go from a galactic Democracy to a dictatorship so shortly if the whole system isn't corrupt! The Jedis are the noble, kind, and generous peacekeepers we envision but hardly see in the original trilogy- and what a contentment it was to see them in their prime! And above all, all the main characters are likable! Queen Amidala (which Portman plays like she was born for it) is caring, courageous, idealist, unselfish- everything you would want her character to be (how on earth Anakin slips to the dark side with her as wife?), Jale Loyd is amazing as a selfless, loving little boy with tremendous talents and aspiration- nothing saying 'dark' to him yet, Neeson delivers a strong lead as the wise, noble master Jedi always in control, and Binks is a fun and sympathetic character, not at all annoying to watch! All the other actors (McGregor, Pernilla, McDiarmid, Park = Darth Mall, Terence Stamp etc) deliver solid performances too and play brilliantly their role. Overall the acting is great, and as for the lack of heartbreaking moments, expected for instance when Anakin parts from his mother, lets just remember that this is 'Star Wars' and DOES NOT want to make us depressed!So, all in all, this is a wonderful movie and deserves our appreciation. It may not reach the height of the original trilogy, but this is to be expected as this episode concerns the beginning of events, in a seemingly peaceful period before major wars, and everything happens in smaller scale! Nevertheless, there is plenty of action, agony and remarkable special effects to go around, although occasionally the action seems to stall a little. Of course, this is a fantasy movie, so a lot of things don't follow strict reason (like the republic allowing unjustified planet invasions, and how it tolerates slavery), but all these fell within the spirit of the 'Star Wars' world. Besides if everything worked fine, no Sith could take over the entire galaxy!Having said the above, I have to say that, besides recently reseeing this film, one main reason I decided to write a review now, is my anger with all the negative criticism this movie has received! This movie was realized by people like George Lucas who both love and respect the original films, and you can see this throughout. In fact, its 100% ''Star Wars'' material! Having watched also extracts about how it was produced, how enormously hard work it took, the scrutiny given for every detail and how innovative it was in some fields (like pioneering digital technology that would become the canon later), one cannot but refute as unjustified and unacceptable this blind rejection, coming from people who sit in the comfort of their chair and just like to be mean! But then again, its a mean world altogether, so...To wrap this up, this was an excellent effort who deserves appraisal, not only from 'Star Wars' funs but from anyone who appreciates good movies! And as we know, the new trilogy's 2 other movies turned out to be just fine too! I hope this new installment, that now comes out from Disney, will manage not to spoil this magnificent Universe so many people love!",8,3,7,15 November 2015
Star Trek," What an utter piece of cr...
","This is my first review, and although it may seem spiteful, I believe it is well justified!Warning! Major spoilers ahead.Well, that was a very good movie for people who are dazzled with sounds and lights- ah, and the brain-dead. But for people who think, that movie was insulting! Lets forget it pays no respect to the original series or its spirit, nor for the details of the original timeline' s character lives. Lets also ignore it presents Kirk like a promiscuous, snorty, arrogant 'rebel without a cause' guy (which is SO old)! (Arguably there are relevances with the original C. Kirk, but the new version doesn't have his insight or gentleness, and is a lot more superficial). So lets concentrate on everything else.I firmly believe that, although not enough by itself, nothing can substitute a good storyline- neither acting, nor special effects, not flashy characters. So lets go for the major holes:1. Major spaceships traveling to past through black holes. Anyone heard of tidal waves who would tear the ship apart?2. Black holes are all about mass. Super dense mass. You can't make a black hole out of ANY kind of liquid- substanced red matter just by exposing it to thin air (or thin Universe vacuum!). And even if you could, it would take a black hole the mass of Earth (which would have approx 2cm event horizon) weeks to consume a planet like Earth, not minutes!! And if you want to use THAT as a weapon, you just throw it to the surface- the planet's gravity would absorb it to the core! You don't need a super drill at all!3.Super novas threaten their immediately nearby neighborhood, not the Galaxy (nor even hypernovas!), unless they emit a gamma-ray burst, and then only the star systems located in the direction of the gamma-ray cone. And of course they don't destroy planets outside their solar system! Anyway, where did that blast took place anyway? If it did outside the Romulan system, races that move faster than light would have all the time to take any action necessary (the blast waves can only travel so fast..). If it was the Romulan star that exploded, well, a race with warp capabilities should have read the signs in their sun like, ehm.. a few million years ago! So, totally unrealistic!4. Besides all these major holes, its the storyline I detested the most. The entire Vulcan planet, home of the most advanced race in Star Trek Universe, and 6 billion Vulcans were gone? How can you like anything with such depressive plot in it? Would we like the movie if Kirk, Spock and the whole Enterprise were gone? No? OK, but the demise of an entire planet (the Vulcans no-less) simply pass by? (unless they go back in time in another movie and fix that)! Total loss...There were so many other things that didn't make sense in this movie. There was no reasonable rank development for the main characters. Kirk jumps from cadet to captain and all the other crew members reach their final ranks in Enterprise from cadets in the blink of an eye? A huge spaceship severely threatens major planets (Vulcan, Earth) and there are NO spaceships in reserve to stop it at all? In any planet? AND NOT AT ALL AIRFORCE OR GROUND-KEEPING FORCES? Was there any background to Niro at all? And didn't the Vulcan be the original homeworld of the Romulans? So he essentially destroyed his initial homeworld? And what happened to the... thousands of the crew that a ship so big as the Romulan should have? And what was that completely silly story between Spock and Uhura?? How did that relate to any of the original character's characters? And what relation existed between the flamboyant new Uhura and the sweet girl that sang ballads in TOS?All in all, that movie was a rip- off for money, designed to capitalize on the Star Trek franchise but only got at superficial level. It massively insults our intelligence, both in terms of plot and of science and common sense. They forgotten there is a SCIENCE in science fiction- otherwise its simply fairy tale. This movie is addressed only to people who don't think- and the sad part is that they are so many, that this became an instant hit! Now, the old series often neglected scientific facts as well- its why I never became a huge fun, but at least it had cool story lines and excellent character development. None of these redeeming features are present here, and this is 2010's, not the sixty's- the world has moved since then. But we get the science fiction we deserve.I so hope they will do something within the Babylon 5 Universe, anything! We need this!Four/10 stars in respect to the decent efforts of all the actors, the tight plot (with all its flaws), very nice special effects, and overall a good adventure who keeps the interest going. Ah, and the presence of Leonard Nimoy- although he shouldn't have endorsed that movie! However, if they make a series out of this, I won't be watching. I would prefer to see the TOS instead.",4,9,12,25 September 2012
Incendies," So outrageous it becomes blatantly funny!
","I never thought it possible that a film with such heavy subject would have me laughing at the end! But thats exactly what happened. After depicting all the clichés that there are about the wars at the middle East (for most of the time, so efficiently and subtly that the movie went quiet well up to a point), and after having us convinced we are actually seeing a really good movie, it drops a twist so 'over the top ' that instead of delving us in shock, it just leave us there standing like in WTF happened now?MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD......So, the mother had an illegitimate child that was taken away from her (after the killing of her boyfriend by her family) ,who was then captured and trained from an opposite group, who was then later captured and imprisoned from the original group, and then in the blink of an eye changes his loyalties, becomes a tormentor, ends up raping his own mother, and the later, after encountering her son/rapist completely accidentally in the other edge of the world, collapses and dies but arranges to sent her offsprings to find their brother/dad for closure! (which she still loves of course!) Sorry, this is so extreme that it no longer seems horrible or serve us to transmit the dismals of war, it just becomes plainly laughable. If you ever saw a movie that tries so hard to make a point that it TOTALLY misses it, then that movie was it!In the background of course, there are masterfully presented descriptions of the horrors of war, especially civil war, which every nation who has been through this process knows how worst is from 'normal' wars, but again everything is given with such extremity, crazy coincidences and the like that you can only accept it if you take them for their symbolic meaning. Unfortunately, the end is so extremely absurd that simply ruins the strength of the movie. Everyone knows what happens in wars. Sorry, such crazy development doesn't happen even in them.The saddest part is how many people embraced that movie, showing beyond a doubt how accurate the story about the naked king (H.C. Andersen) still stands today, both among the critics and the common people. But then again, there is no surprise there!In conclusion if you want to see a 'punch in the gut' about such subjects, see 'Whistleblower' (or Hotel Rwanda and the like), who truly deliver. This one is betrayed by the fact that it simply tries too much, and hence looses the realism that would give the movie its strength. Oh well, next time...",5,24,51,29 July 2014
Call Me by Your Name," Just another movie to promote Depravity, Vulgarity and Perversion
","(Maybe only minor spoilers)I had no intention to see this movie at all, but I fast-forwarded most of it to be able to write an impartial review. And I literally coulnd't believe my eyes. This is a completely vulgar movie designed to do only one thing: To promote immorality and perversion as if they are the most natural thing, in order to contribute in the complete extinction of whatever morals have been left in Western societies. Without getting into any details, it features the love and sexual experiences of a teen with both a girl and an older man. It includes lots of sex scenes, especially homosexual ones, and a lot of other vulgar scenes,(like the peach scene) along with the admittingly beautiful scenery, and is run by a superficial 'intellectual' vibe in order to seem smarter and pass its central message with more ease. And the central message is the absolute acceptance of immorality, promiscuity and perversion (the last scene with the father's dialogue has to be seen to be believed) All these in a nice rapping, but not much else.It is literally inconceivable how degenerate our societies have become for such a movie not only to be able to be produced, not only to be higly appreciated by the as-known-to all deeply corrupted Hollywood, to the point where is nominated for Oscars, but mostly to be welcomed or accepted as a nice movie by the majority of society and to receive such good reviews here. It's past the point of shame. There are really no excuses for a movie who endorses promiscutity and perversion so openly as this one (and with no less than a teen boy as its subject). I am writting this review to state that not all people are completely stunned and some of us still remember the difference between right and wrong, and we will try to wake up others.Besides the above elements, the movie does feature some beatifull scenery and some nice archaeological info (for which the two stars). But that's just a nice wrapping, as I said. In all, this is a disgraceful movie with no other merits at all, and the fact it knows such promotion is almost impossible to believe, but as I said, it simply underscores how perverted our societies have become- and perhaps, how hard we shall have to fight to restore some of our values if we ever decide to wake up...",2,11,51,18 February 2018
