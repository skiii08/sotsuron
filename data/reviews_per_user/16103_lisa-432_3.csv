The Ring," FINALLY!! Brilliant and dark!!
","Just when I thought that the talent for 'seeing' horror had died with Stanley Kubrick along comes Gore Verbinski and brings it back to refreshing life! At first I was skeptical about the teen element being involved (usually a cymbal crashing cue for long holds on tight shirts, tons of unnecessary screaming--not to mention screaming while 'running' in high heels, and the most unabashed use of one-liners dredged up from every horror flick since the 70's), but thankfully that wasn't the case at all. The Ring was a truly edgy experience! The sound effects alone had me twitching, and I LOVED the puzzle of the video, its solution, and of course Samara's special effects most of all. The cinematography also gets an A+, beautiful work!As far as the acting, Brian Cox was OUTSTANDING (as usual); Naomi Watts was really believable (especially as an angry/frazzled single mom); Martin Henderson was INCREDIBLY hot.Now I realize that the only reason this film exists at all is because of the Japanese original (and of course the book) but what I don't understand is how anybody even thought that the original was 'scary/terrifying/astonishing/blah blahblah'. There weren't any special effects except for those annoying close ups and the screen changing colors (which is sooooo late 60's Hammer I can't even begin to go there). Sudako's 'death face' had me on the floor laughing every time. If I'm watching a horror movie that is supposed to be legendary for scares, then I want to be scared; If I want to be stupidly amused I'll watch Freddy, Jason and Michael. I LOVE films that have plots that make you think and Japan has a ton of them, especially in horror, they're just not directed in a way that I find terrifying. Now the Japanese manga (comic books) based on The Ring series, THOSE are scary.The American version of The Ring is creepy as hell, and far above its original source.",10,1,2,21 January 2005
Jarhead," 'Welcome to The Suck'...yeah, no kidding.
","I have to admit I was really pumped to see this film: the trailer was strong, the score was powerful and inspiring, the cinematography was gorgeous; it was a perfect set up for a satisfying kind of war film experience.So...what the hell? Being the wife of a Desert Storm vet (Navy-- go Bunker Hill), I was interested in getting someone else's perspective of the war, and I'd have to say that if my husband told me a story as boring and as impossibly inaccurate as this one, I would have thought that he went AWOL before he was shipped off and just made it up from there.And even THAT would have been a better story than this.So we have a very clever point of view meet-and-greet with Anthony Swofford and get an appropriately small idea of why he joined the Marines (and due to what he's come from I don't blame him).We follow him through boot-camp (in which the style and build up screams Full Metal Jacket, but unfortunately without the stylistic intensity and wit of R. Lee Ermey), and hop into the war, and that, my friends, is where you are truly experiencing The Suck.***SPOILER ALERT*** These guys spend 98% of their time babysitting sand, the other 2% shaking their asses at each other or faking orgies to embarrass their Staff Sgt. And while I have NO problem appreciating exactly how effective boot camp exercise is on the male body, I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't get shot for frat-boy behavior in a wartime situation.Oh and Marine officers don't preform 'blue' stand-up: like a roomful of shouting Marines 'makes his d*** wiggle'. That kind of comedy you get from the drill instructors NOT high ranking officers.Anyway, in the war film tradition you have: conflict with those in charge, one or two comrades around you, as well as conflicts in adapting to the foreign environment and...well...a bit of shooting of the bad guys here and there, topped off with a coming-of-age perspective. Now I understand that it was a new idea to have a war film where they are nowhere near shooting range of the enemy, and to highlight Swofford's frustration considering they've all been wound up to kill something since they entered boot camp, but does the audience REALLY need to be dragged through it too? And even that might have been bearable if I felt that Swofford had come out of it a changed man--he seems as emotionally dead and lost at the end as he was in the beginning.What, the whole message of the film was 'Never get your hopes up?' or 'You can't always get what you want?' People can get that message loud and clear everyday at any drive thru, so when you're talking about war something way more profound than that needs to come across before the final credits roll.***END Of SPOILER*** But I will say that the 'video from home' scene was a brilliant surprise.Personally I find the whole thing offensive to the honor of The Corps. Marines always, always, always embody the strength, sacrifice and Don't Tread On Me pride of the US in reality as well as in film. They are in there to make the enemy 'come correct'. That's why they're first in and last out in the real world. When you want areas guarded you call the Army, when you want s*** handled you call the Marines. That's what they love, that's why they're there and that's why they're the basis of war films. To show them without this kind of power or at least an attempt to grab it kills their entire legendary essence in that moment. And while I'll never lose respect for them as a force, I hate the idea of a film presenting them as though they didn't deserve to be called heroes or that they're egomanical frauds.I will give credit to Sam Mendes for his fabulous eye--the scope of the desert was phenomenal; the main actors were perfect choices: Jake Gyllenhaal gives us some very realistic moments of rage; I thought Jamie Foxx was under-used as a our Marine Lifer but had right attitude for it.Basically, if you want to develop the 1000-yard stare this is a great starting point.",2,3,5,10 March 2006
War of the Worlds," Well....(shrug)
","I just watched WOTW last night, and Spielberg does his job of completely drawing you into what you're looking at (I checked the tree tops first-thing when I came out of Jurassic Park), I loved the CGI, the cast chosen and of course the action involved and was totally ready to give it a 10 all the way, but then I started reading the other reviews for the film here, and had to actually reconsider what was so great about it.I have NEVER had to do that with a Spielberg movie--he gives us a fun or incredible story, great characters and side-kicks, and I'm either leaving the theater extremely satisfied or (in the case of Shindler's List & The Color Purple) mopping my face. I always fall into a Spielberg movie ready to go and believe whatever he throws at me because it's always something that's going to work itself out perfectly or justly by the end credits. It's always flawless or fun.And I DID feel okay about WOTW at the end (not wildly excited, but I knew I wouldn't lose any sleep over it), but the reviewers here made me realize quite a bit that was off, blatantly sloppy or something in between.And I'd like to give my husband credit for wrapping up Tom's character, and I guess the movie itself, in one sentence: 'Tom likes to run around and look at stuff.' Yep, that covers everybody in the film. (except the daughter...she just likes to play Mother Figure and guilt people into hearing her) I find it bizarre as well as sad that that's all there was to him, although I must confess I thought the car scene when he's trying to calmly argue with his shrieking daughter was a class act...and that of course HAD to be acting, because it seems that there isn't a parent alive that wouldn't start rummaging around for something on the dashboard to swat her with by then.But the daughter was interesting for an old soul, and Mom wasn't used enough, the son felt more like a hangnail than an actual family member (he could have been out of the script entirely and it wouldn't have changed anything, except that maybe the daughter might have been the one scrambling to see the show on the hill (as if the screaming, the military, smoking inferno and general chaos didn't give enough of a clue). And I was rather ticked that sonny boy showed up in Boston, I think that because they didn't suffer a personal loss makes it as UN-Spielberg as it can get. And the fact that Mom floated down the stairs of a mint-condition brownstone was exceedingly annoying!! That, and I couldn't stand the idea that these aliens would actually take the time to look in the basement of one house...would they seriously do that with each one? Don't think so.Basically the reviewer 'Ali_Catterall' nailed the flaws perfectly, and with just the right amount of venom. LOL (Titled: 'No one would have believed/ 28 June 2005). Check it out, it's absolutely hysterical! Basically, if you're only into visuals, this is a fantastic film and you'll get an eye-full, but if you're going for a cohesive storyline and reasonable motivation, I'm afraid you'll have to look elsewhere.",3,2,3,10 July 2005
