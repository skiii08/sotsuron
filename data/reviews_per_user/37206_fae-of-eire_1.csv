Sucker Punch," Disappointing to say the least.
","Fifteen minutes in I could only just barely discern a plot line, but had no idea who the characters were, nor was I given any reason to care about them beyond the most superficial insinuation of highly sexualized vulnerability. The film is essentially a high-budget and spectacularly shallow music video. Hard to judge the performances as there is little story or real dialogue beyond all the posing & choreography; sort of a pity given the leads (Browning, Malone, and Cornish) who have had strong performances in their past. The production and art design stand out... as do the costumes... The steam-punk/sci-fi/fantasy theme is visually interesting, and vaguely entertaining at best. A faintly misogynistic Alice in Wonderland by way of Heavy Metal 2000. Mostly a bore.",4,4,10,25 June 2011
