Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Barat is Porno Garbage
","Borat meets former Congressman Bob Barr and serves him cheese, saying it's a traditional gift in Kazakhstan. Barr swallows it then Borat tells him it's made from his wife's breast milk. Ha ha ha. You see, Barr is ridiculed because he accepted a friendship offering from Borat when everyone knows smart people always know to first ask if cheese they're given is made of the giver's wife's breast milk or not. Is that funny? Then, with Alan Keyes, he describes how he and a gay had sex with a plastic fist in a shower. Yeah, funny stuff.Debbie Schlussel says the movie should really be called 'Sascha's Big Fart on Middle America.' Midwesterners at a rodeo are depicted as anti-Muslim racists, bigots, and dummies. They're supposed to be the bad ones for booing Borat when he purposely perverts the American National Anthem and says 'We support your War OF Terror.' A Southern Evangelical Church finds a down-and-out-on-his-luck Borat asleep in the sidewalk in front. They kindly take him in and even give him a bus ride on his way to California. Despite their kindness, he ridicules them, showing them speaking in tongues and trying to make them look bad. Uproarious. Kind, generous people are so gullible! Equally disturbing was Borat's sojourn to a Southern mansion where he is invited to dinner. First, he meets with an etiquette teacher. He shows her a picture of his alleged son. Most of the picture is of the son's large penis. That's funny? Maybe, if you're five or a drunk at the frat house. When he goes to dinner, Borat intimates to one of the husbands at the dinner table that his wife is ugly. After using the bathroom, he brings a white bag filled with his feces to the dinner table. Ha ha ha.Racism against Blacks is funny so Borat uses a fat, Black prostitute (overflowing out of her skimpy sequined tube top), whom Cohen invites to the home while the dinner is going on. She's, by the way, the major Black person in the movie (there are brief scene with Keyes and some inner city Black kids).'Borat' hitches a ride with some Southern frat boys, who make indefensible anti-Semitic comments. They're hardly representative of America, where anti-Semitism is at one of the world's lowest levels, but the film implies they are. In Cohen's own native Britain, anti-Semitism is practically the national theology (second to Islamism).Much has been made of Borat's attacks on Jews. But we laugh at those because it's implicit that comedian Cohen is making fun of the anti-Semite he's playing. That's not the problem. It's that he celebrates attacking Americans.Cohen--who proudly proclaims that he's a Jew--has no problem savaging American Christians, Southerners, rodeo fans, and others who are kind and generous to this odd foreigner they believe is truly in need of help.If that causes anyone be anti-Semitic, who could blame them...Borat's a piece of garbge.",1,24,51,6 November 2006
