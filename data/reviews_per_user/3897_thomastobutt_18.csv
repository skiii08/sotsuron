The Incredible Hulk," UNIQUE MCU FILM, COULD OF BEEN BETTER!
","Comparing 'The Incredible Hulk' to other MCU films, it doesn't quite feel part of the same universe, unlike most fans of the MCU, I actually found this film really interesting and a fun one to go back and watch. The recast of Bruce Banner from Edward Norton to Mark Ruffalo in later films is a main reason why it feels so separate from the MCU, the only real connection is General Ross and Tony Stark in the after credit scene. The Hulk CGI looks a bit outdated but I guess nobody's perfect.",6,0,0,27 November 2019
Iron Man 3," GOOD MOVIE RUINED BY PLOT TWIST!
","I personally enjoyed a large portion of this film, it was at the point where the MCU started to felt like it had a massive future ahead. The villain, Aldrich Killian followed the same path as Syndrome from The Incredibles, the fan of the big super hero who grows up to become his villain, I didn't find him that interesting, I was more interested in the dark, terrifying Mandarin, who was shaping up to be one of the MCU's best villains. The twist at the end
where 'The Mandarin' was revealed to be an actor called Trevor was a huge
disappointment.",7,0,1,27 November 2019
It," GREAT BILL SKARSGARD!!!
","Where most horror films fail is where they chuck in an extreme change of sound and make something jump onto the screen and rely on that for the whole film, It does include those jump scares but earns them from a good story and compelling acting. The kids in this film all represent certain types of people in society and all feel accurate and realistic. Bill Skarsgard's performance as Pennywise is something special. A lot of the creepy aspects of Pennywise, the laugh, eye movement, smile, voice was all from Skarsgard with no special effects or anything.I must say, when the members of the Losers Club encounter their individual fears, a lot of the creatures look silly and fake, for me personally the only scenes that scared me were the ones featuring Pennywise.This film doesn't give many jump scares compared to other horror films, but does give you a good story and a creepy villain.",7,1,2,14 December 2019
Captain Marvel," Poor 1st Half but redeemed by 2nd half
","I'm a huge Marvel fan and saw this film the day it came out in the UK with my friends who are also big marvel fans, the first half of the film I thought wasn't even a mediocre Marvel film and the humour wasn't funny that much, however in the second half a lot improved. There are plot twists which made the film more exciting and interesting and the humour and storyline in general just got better. I do believe that the dialogue was very bland and that Brie Larson had a lot of 1-liners, I think it turned into an average film, redeemed by the second half and the hole it fills from previous Marvel films........ oh and exciting post credit scenes ;)To round it all off, one of the best moments from the film is the Marvel intro where they normally have the it flashing through MCU characters on the marvel logo, but this time it was filled with Stan Lee cameos",6,1,2,9 March 2019
Knives Out," GREAT FUN AND MYSTERY!
","This film became very attractive before release as soon as they announced the cast, and it did not disappoint. The cast make the characters very likable and the film wouldn't be as good without them.The first half of this film appears to be a classic murder mystery, but then it takes a big twist. Because of this twist we are lead to believe that the majority of the movie, there is no murderer. But then takes another turn and it turns out there is. Coming to the conclusion of the movie when revealing the killer, multiple twists happen again.You are lead to doubt yourself the whole movie as it could take a turn at any moment, which makes it so entertaining. It did not feel like a normal murder mystery.",8,0,2,12 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," WAY TOO MUCH IS HAPPENING!
","The Rise of Skywalker follows on from The Last Jedi, a film which left many disappointed. When following on from a disappointed film, mending the mistakes is often what drags the film down. The final entry in the Skywalker saga feels like its own spin off story including the main characters. As said in the headline, there is way too many things happening within this film, therefore feels very rushed and crammed.The Star Wars universe is one of the most fun environments to see on screen, so that does not disappoint and it was fun to see all the different types of terrain on all the different planets that are visited throughout the film.The film itself was pretty enjoyable, however it doesn't feel like it has concluded a saga which has been going on for 40+ years.",7,1,3,23 December 2019
Ant-Man," EXTREMELY UNDERRATED FILM!
","As said in the title, this film is extremely underrated in my opinion, it may have to do with the smaller stakes amongst such big films in the MCU. Paul Rudd was made for this role (unless the role was quite literally made for him) and he has great chemistry with the actors around him. This films great comic relief through character such as Luis or through the increase/decrease of objects like the 'Thomas the Tank Engine' train set fight scene at the end.The film is very refreshing and entertaining, definitely worth the watch. Also there's a cool cameo from the Falcon which just reminds you that is part of the MCU.",8,2,2,27 November 2019
Nightcrawler," GREAT STORY, GREAT MOVIE, GREAT GYLLENHAAL!
","This is the movie which truly discovered Jake Gyllenhaal's talent, from the very beginning you could tell that his character, Louis Bloom, was mad but due to the compelling story and suspense it slowly slips your mind, however outbreaks of anger towards his partner Rick (Riz Ahmed) or his love interest Nina Romina (Rene Russo) reminds you of his madness which is where everything about his success in this job role clicks into place, with Lou sabotaging Rick at the end being the final nail in the coffin. Displayed in the opening scene and his interrogation, Lou Bloom is a very calm and persuasive person.Very underrated film, a true piece of beauty in the thriller genre from Dan Gilroy.",9,2,3,27 November 2019
Man of Steel," SOLID INTRO TO THE DCEU!
","Just like Iron Man with the MCU, Man of Steel delivers a good starting point for the DCEU. It doesn't instantly want to make it clear that is part of a shared universe which is where Iron Man succeeded, only focusing on the hero who's name is in the title.Man of Steel is an interesting origin story of Superman as Earth truly sees him in the spotlight but it can feel quite boring in parts throughout the movie.",7,1,1,28 November 2019
Avengers: Endgame," FAVOURITE FILM OF MY LIFE!
","I saw this film 4 times in cinema, that just says how good it is. I am a huge MCU fan but even for someone isn't as big of a fan, you can still see how this is a special movie, no wonder it is the highest grossing movie of all time so far.Where Avengers: Infinity War left off, the remaining Avengers are left crushed, grasping onto any possible idea of trying to bring their friends, families and others back from their decimation.For me, this is the most unique film in the whole franchise because it deals with problems that hasn't been seen in the MCU before. All hope was lost, Thanos was killed after the remaining Avengers found out he destroyed the Infinity Stones.The amount of foreshadowing, call backs and references in this three hour long ride was outstanding with some of the most epic scenes ever seen on screen. Captain America wielding Mjolnir had everyone jumping in their seats, the portals sequence had everyone screaming along with the famous line 'AVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!'. To top it all off, all those emotions were crushed when Tony Stark saved the universe at the cost of his life.Many opportunities for future MCU films have been opened up from this film and many people need some time off to process this masterpiece.",9,1,6,27 November 2019
Saving Private Ryan," LIFE CHANGING!
","Surely this has to be the best war film of all time!Saving Private Ryan portrays the invasion of Normandy through American, Captain Miller and troops point of view. Not only does this film have tense and amazing footage, but it also makes you feel the pain that all the soldiers are experiencing, that of which not many films can perfect.This classic is so realistic that army veterans have suffered PTSD from watching this film.",9,0,0,28 November 2019
Avengers: Age of Ultron," MEDIOCRE MOVIE, SPADER IS BRILLIANT!
","This MCU did what I thought was impossible, it made the most forgetful Avengers film ever, it is such a mediocre film. It had some great moments, like the Avengers party, the Hulk vs Hulkbuster scene and even James Spader as Ultron was perfection.You don't feel that this film is a high stakes Avengers film, but in fact it is. The whole sequence at Hawkeye's house ruined the momentum and the tone of the whole film just felt a little off.",7,0,0,27 November 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," ENTERTAINING BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST, SOLID SEQUEL
","Just like Guardians of the Galaxy, this film is fun and refreshing, however a large portion of the middle section of the film, where Quill, Gamora, Drax and Mantis are on Ego's planet is very boring and lacks anything interesting. A lot of the humour isn't as funny compared to the first film (besides Drax) and seems like that they feel all the humour would land because of the first film.I personally think that Yondu was the star of the show, how far his character arc developed over two films was quite amazing and turned him into a character loved by most. He will be missed.",7,0,0,27 November 2019
Thor," QUITE BORING, NECESSARY INTRODUCTION TO THOR!
","The first MCU film to introduce us to an unearthly plain has some interesting moments but is mostly quite boring. This film is directed by Kenneth Branagh, who is best known for directing movies from Shakespeare's work, so when in Asgard you get this royal tone but as soon as Thor arrives on Earth, the tone completely changes and becomes uninteresting. Chemistry between characters sorely lacks and the only main character you really seem to like a fair
amount is Loki.",6,0,0,27 November 2019
Joker," WELL TOLD COMPELLING DARK STORY!
","Coming into this film, the majority of people knew what the result of Arthur Fleck would be by the end of the film, despite their being no mystery to it, it doesn't prevent the ending from being shocking and compelling.The audience is fully aware that Arthur will turn evil but from what we see in the film, what he goes through and how society treats him, you kind of support him and want him to pursue his beliefs. In the long run when he finally feels free, it makes you feel happy for him.Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal as the Joker is Oscar-worthy, as he perfectly describes his descent into madness.",9,1,3,24 December 2019
Iron Man," WHAT AN INTRODUCTION TO THE MCU!!!
","Going into this film, many people were skeptical about Robert Downey Jr portraying one of the most famous comic book heroes due to previous drug problems, oh how wrong they were proven. Downey Jr instantly portrays a comic book accurate persona of Tony Stark which carries on during his tenure in the MCU.This movies storyline is pretty simple but the execution of it is a masterpiece, at the time no one knew that this would be part of an intertwined universe. Couldn't of started on a better note than this.",8,1,2,27 November 2019
Jojo Rabbit," REFRESHING FILM!
","This comedy/drama of World War II is very refreshing with a great film debut from young Roman Griffin Davis as Jojo, a young boy striving to be a Nazi.Taika Waititi, who both directs and plays a imaginary friend to Jojo version of Hitler, adds an distinct and independent feel to all the films he's involved in (eg. Thor: Ragnarok).Not only does this film have compelling characters, but it also has a large amount of comedy which is all very enjoyable and not lame. I haven't felt like this about many films but Jojo Rabbit compelled me for the whole duration of the film witnessing its funny humour and very deep moments with his mother. A very beautiful and refreshing film!",9,1,3,14 December 2019
Thor: The Dark World," DULL, BORING, WORST MCU FILM SO FAR!
","Boring, dull and forgettable. This film does not feel like it has any importance at all, it feels like it is just another solo hero film which will not affect the future of the cinematic universe that it's in, however this film introduces the audience to the Aether, also known as the Reality Stone, which is one of six Infinity Stones which is a main part of the MCU. Malekith, the villain of this film, is only remembered for being the most forgetful villain of the whole MCU. The film itself doesn't have any 'really bad/embarrassing moments', it
just doesn't have any 'good moments'.",6,0,0,27 November 2019
