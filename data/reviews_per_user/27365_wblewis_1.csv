The Ring," The funniest horror movie I've ever seen.
","I saw the movie last night. I logged on IMDB this morning to see if anyone felt like they wasted their time like I did. It seems everyone here loved it, though I can't see why.I agree with the folks who say it is well filmed. 'Crisp and clean' one user says. I even liked most of the special effects. The best effect coming at the end of the movie when the male hero is watching the TV at his apartment on his seventh day. (I'm trying not to give things away)
But, if it weren't for being able to watch and hear the audience's reactions, I would fell like I completely wasted my time. The outbursts of laughter and comments that were made were the only things that made watching this film even remotely entertaining.I guess I came from the 'old days' of scary movies that feature characters like Jason, Micheal Myers, and Leatherface. I don't get off on the gore but rather the suspense. This movie had neither.All in all, IT SUCKED. Maybe two stars for technical quality, but that's it.",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
