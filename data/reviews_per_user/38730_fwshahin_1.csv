The Ring," Best scary movie in PG-13 category
","I am a serious movie watcher who likes to see movies like PULP FICTION, MEMENTO. I am not really a horror movie fan cause the horror movies released after '90 are all full of nudity , blood and gore.They always forgot to include the main part Horror.I went see this movie cause my friends took me too see it. What can i say? After a long time i had a hard time to sleep for a movie. I gave it an 8 because it has everything to scare the s**t out of you. Specially the last ten minutes!!! Whoof........ the plot is kind of unsolved in the movie, you have to watch it a couple of times to figure it out (check the IMDB message board for THE RING, you will know why)but damn......i dont have much words to explain it. Those who think you have a lion heart watch the movie at a silent night ALONE. If the last scene of the movie still doesn't scare you then i guess you dont even have a heart. For others DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT. You might give yourself a mini heart attack. So if you wanna get a scary movie  for a Haloween night this is the pick for you. Enjoy (& scare).",8,0,0,3 November 2002
