The Avengers," awful boredom
","movie is only and only for ages between 6-16. anyone with any expectation from cinema should skip this one. a movie for video game addcits. no clear plot. everything is foreseeable. nothing new. just piled on to make a difference. too much of mediocre ends up creating something less then mediocre. pity the time and the money i spent on this usual Hollywood garbage. i think people should wait for it to come on TV. not even worth the DVD or bluray. everyone here with a positive comment has a fantasy world where, super heros are logical. if the movie was shorter maybe i could let myself go, but it is tooooo long brother. telling you skip this one and thank me later.",1,37,121,5 May 2012
21 Jump Street," nothing interesting or new
","nothing new. nothing interesting. the same old jokes same old theme. you know the end from the beginning, so why add action adventure theme to it... if it is just a comedy then have something original. try to remember all those dumb cop comedies. there really is nothing more here. Ä± don't know who gives ratings to these movies at IMDb but something is really wrong if this movie is getting almost 8 out of 10 stars. yes the formerly fat funny dude is now thin funny, but his only capacity is to look dumb and streotypy. thats it. if you want comedy see the British version of death at a funeral. anything comes out of Hollywood is a massive failure.",3,19,40,3 May 2012
