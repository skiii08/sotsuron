The Blair Witch Project," This movie is a real horror
","What a great premise for an independent film.  Too bad it was so poorly executed.  I found myself looking at my watch and wondering how much longer I would have to sit there until something scary happened.  Nothing scary ever happened.  The Blair Witch Project is boring, annoying, but definitely not scary - not the least little bit.  I left the theater wishing I hadn't spent the money for the ticket.The whining of our three lost heros is the dominant feature of the movie. With all the bickering and arguing, I figure that the folks who like this movie are professional wrestling fans who enjoy Jerry Springer.  The only redeeming value of this film is the very last shot.It's hard to imagine how this film could have garnered so much acclaim.This movie is a stinky dog.",1,0,2,28 August 1999
