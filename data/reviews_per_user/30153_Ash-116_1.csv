Vertigo," the master's best
","For me Vertigo will always be hitchcock's best. It has all his trademarks, his avant garde photography and his beautiful lighting. What makes the film excel above the rest is the plot and the acting. Vertigo isn't over-blown. It isn't about world espionage or psychotic killers or deadly birds and wheel-chair bound voyeurs- its as if Hitchcock became reserved, mature. People who find it boring or slow just cant get over the childish stories they're used to hear in Hitchcock movies. In this one we get the real stuff- not psychology as an excuse for a murder story but a murder story told as an excuse to a moving story of one very broken man's obsession (the WONDERFUL James Stewart, who's every face gesture can stand for a thousand words in this film) and his object of affection- the beautiful Kim Novak. Watch this one- it will change you.",10,2,4,21 September 1999
