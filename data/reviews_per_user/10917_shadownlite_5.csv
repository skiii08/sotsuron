The Ring," Waste Of Time
","I won't give away any of the plot, if you can say this film has a plot which is a stretch. I will just give my reaction to the film.I was told by many people how impressive and scary this film was. I avoided it for 3 years because I am not a fan of horror films. I borrowed this film yesterday because I was curious why people where so into this film.I spent the whole time heckling it and making snarky comments about it because it was not even the slightest bit scary. It was just a movie with a barely there plot line with lots of lame, random images that were suppose to be freaky. I was able to sit through the whole thing and instead of feeling scared, had to resist the urge to laugh all the way through.The only freaky thing was the little kid. He was definitely a piece of work and needed therapy even before viewing the videotape.I think my brother, who joined me in heckling the film (and he is a horror film lover) summed it up best when he said: 'I guess the point of the movie is VHS is evil so watch DVDs.' *Thumbs WAY Down*",1,0,2,15 April 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Disjointed and Lame
","I admit to not being a Harry Potter fan but I have seen the other two movies, and found them enjoyable so went to see the new film today.My main problem with the movie is it is so disjointed. It doesn't have a good, steady flow to storyline and jumps around way too much. You never get to see anything in the film play out from beginning to end....you suddenly join the action in progress or jump out of the action right in the middle and are suddenly at the end. I found that extremely annoying and it really hurt the film. Shoe me the whole Quiddich match...don't just join it in progress and stop it when Harry falls without showing how everyone reacted to Harry's fall. Things like this just ruined the flow and made it seem like there were huge plot holes in the film.They also didn't explain things fully in the film. They left out key parts of the book...like why the map was so important...and then would give you a rushed explanation later through character dialogue. If they had explained the map earlier, as well as the adult characters relationships to one another through their history, all the adult characters wouldn't have had to spout, in rapid fire delivery, loads of dialogue to explain their relationships with one another in the Shreiking Shack. Which left many adults in the movie theatre actually saying out loud, 'What the hell?' and looking confused. If I hadn't read the book I would have been very confused as well which is a problem, you shouldn't have to read the book to enjoy the film. You should be able to at least get an idea of what is going on so you can enjoy it without prior knowledge of the story. Malfoy got very little screen time this time around and I seem to remember him having a lot more to do with the story in the book. The way that this movie made the relationship to Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione and Malfoy look pathetic. It truly made it look like the three were bullying Malfoy and not the other way around. This is not a good thing and I really feel it did his character a dis-service. He doesn't seem as menacing now and you actually start to feel a bit sorry for him because he appears so picked on.I did like the way it showed the surroundings of Hogwarts. The hillsides, lakes, and forests were stunning though, I kept expecting to hear the 'The King from the Golden Hall', complete with Norwegian fiddle, from the LOTR soundtrack to start playing as the camera swept over the hillsides and forests or orcs to attack them in the forest. I think the director did steal a bit of the countryside idea from LOTR. It was nice to finally see the surroundings of the school because it explained what was so special about it.I also liked the transitions that showed the passing of time. It was done in a really nice way...the owl flying into snowflakes which turn to snow covering the ground....the tree losing one leaf and then suddenly dropping them all. That was well done.The kids playing Potter, Hermione, and Ron are starting to really relax in their roles and grow a little as actors. Especially Daniel Radcliff. I think that they should try to keep the kids in the roles they have as long as they can because it would be a bit jarring to have to recast them. I know that they are quickly growing up so this may be impossible.The Dementors were cool and would appear very scary to small children. The effect of 'sucking the soul' out of people that they do would also scare small children a lot so it really surprised me that many adults brought their small children to this film. The Dementors and the werewolf would definitely not be good for small children to watch and may give them nightmares. It will be interesting to see where this series goes and how the, even longer, next book will be brought to film. Hopefully, it will not be as disjointed as this one.",2,8,15,7 June 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," Glad I Waited For It To Come Out On Video
","I have the original, The Matrix, listed as one of my favorite films of all time. I was excited to hear the squels were coming out. Then, on release my friends who saw the Matrix:Reloaded told me what a middle of the road movie it was. So, I pocketed my $9.50 and waited for the video release.I was so glad I did! Matrix:Reloaded is boring, full of plotholes, and inane. It was like watching one long videogame without much plot and I am sorry..I didn't rent a videogame...I rented a movie! I didn't buy the 'love' between Trinty and Neo. They seemed bored with each other and the sex scene...well Trinty looked less than into Neo during it. So, when he brings her back after she is shot...I just yelled 'PLEASE!!!!' I mean he saves Trinty, who seems bored with him,  over saving Zion...what a LAMER!
I also thought the scene where Neo flew and the shipmate (sorry forgot his name) said 'He is doing the Superman thing' was beyond stupid. What? Neo flies now? Ummm yeah.The only sequence I enjoyed was the chase on the freeway. That was very impressive and made me watch the video twice...well this scene and my next head scratching moment.That moment would be....where the hell did 'The Kid' come from and how doe she know Neo...I don't remember Neo saving him in the first Matrix movie so why does this kid say he did? What the hell happens to the spoon the kid gives Neo to give to the Oracle? I never saw him give it to her? Did he lie to the Kid about giving it to her?This film needed a lot of work to make it able to stand out there on it's own. I thought it just had a syndicated scifi-show feeling and the 'To Be Continued' at the end stamped the feeling deep into my soul.I am now leery of watching Matrix: Revolutions....because I now it will tarnish the first movies greatness even further. I think the first movie should have been the only movie. Then we could have all imagined what happened....or at least the film-makers should have done a better job with the storyline instead of making it a long, boring, videogame.",2,0,0,20 November 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Excellent
","I saw Return of the King on opening day and have to say that it was worth the buying the tickets in advance and waiting to get in for a good seat.It was full of drama, humor, action, emotion, and the most impressive battle scenes I have seen in recent time. I sat awestruck for 3 1/2 hours not once wishing for it to end and feelings ad when it did. take in with just one sitting. I was a little surprised that a lot of the film was of actions that took place in the Two Towers book of the trilogy...but they included just enough of the Return of the King book to be satisfying to this fan.
I am planning to see Return of the King again and take more of it in because there is so much happening in the book and it is impossible to take in with just one viewing.Bravo Peter Jackson!",10,0,0,19 December 2003
Gangs of New York," Waste Of Time
","'Gangs of New York' wasted my time as I viewed it. It was long, slow, and had little of interest in it. I had rented it with the hopes that a lot of action and a good storyline would be contained within the movie. Sadly, it let me down.I should have known it would be a yawner when the starting fight bored me. All slow motion, fake looking blood, and not at all exciting. It proved to be a movie that had a lot of drag to it and I find my mind wandering at times and myself just taking in the whole look of the film, the sets, the clothing, the background players, ect.I also should have been prepared when I saw the first error in the movie right at the beginning of the film! The cut on 'Priest' Vallon's face kept changing sides on his face and appearing/disappearing. I noticed it on the first viewing so I know that it is obvious. If the first minutes contain an error like that, that is so noticable, then it shows that the movie will not be that great. It shows some slackness on the moviemaker's side when this sort of thing happens.The acting was decent...I just wish the actors where in a better movie than this. Cameron Diaz really stands out in my mind because she did a very good performance in this film...and she was hardly recognizable as the blonde, peppy, bubblehead she usually plays in films.I did like the look of 'Old New York' and the clothing. It's just too bad the story is not as good as the whole 'look' of the movie. I am glad I waited for it to come out on video/DVD to see because I would have felt I had wasted money if I had gone to see it in the theatre. It was a true waste of my time.",4,2,8,10 July 2003
