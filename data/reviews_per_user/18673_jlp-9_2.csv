The Blair Witch Project," Apparently I missed something
","Apparently I missed something, because I thought the movie stunk. Scary? Nope. Suspenseful? Nope. Disappointing? Yup. The beginning drags, the middle is good for a couple giggles and the ending starts to get scary, and then boom, the ending credits are rolling. The cinema verite makes for a different approach, but overall, the movie lacks the horror that makes up its hype. Who do I contact for a refund?",Null,0,1,31 July 1999
Mystic River," Awesome!
","Wow, just got home from watching this. Very intense, amazing twists. Sean Penn continues to amaze me with his acting skills. The whole cast was fantastic. Lots of applause from the audience at the end. Walked out of there feeling rather disturbed. And as a Boston girl, it was great to see the familiar scenery.",10,1,2,8 October 2003
