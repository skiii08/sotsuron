The Ring," OMFG, this is scary!
","5*/5*The Ring is without question the scariest, most suspenseful and haunting film i have ever seen. But in a good way, luckily.I saw this film with a friend, at 01-03 am, on a winternight where the wind was blowing like crazy - all the ingredients to make this movie even more scary then it was build up to. All through the picture we just shouted 'OMFG, this is some scary s*it certainly is... I told one of my friends about it and she had to tell me to stop because the images she imagined was freaking her out. Pretty impressive, i must say.But anyways, i can highly recommend this film - even though it's not for people who aren't into horrormovies, or doesn't like psychological suspense.
Rent it, buy it, go to the theatres, whatever - just make sure you get to see this fantastic movie.",7,1,1,8 April 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Stop complaining!
","I can't state that this 3rd and last part of The Matrix trilogy is a brilliant piece of cinematic art. But it isn't your typical Hollywood blockbuster, and although - compared to The Matrix, you might say that Revolutions isn't exactly what you'd expect, but then; what did you expect?To create the second sequel to such a revolutionary masterpiece as the 1st one was, is merely impossible - but I believe that the Wachowski's has done what's humanly possible.The special effects, CGI, and scenario is even more impressive in Revolutions, and to make radical changes, just for the audiences crave for something new and surprising wouldn't be a good move. There is no question, that this can't be disappointing. So what is? I'll tell you what is:Nothing. Maybe one could have written the script differently, deleted some unnecessary scenes or changed the dialog for the better. But a lot of people went to Reloaded, and will go to Revolutions and demand the impossible. A movie as surprising, and mind-blowing as The Matrix was. It CAN'T be done!The only advice I can bring you, if you haven't seen this film, is to expect nothing, instead of everything. Because if you do demand everything, you'll be really unhappy with the result. Nothing is perfect, and although we want it to be, The Matrix trilogy isn't anyway.But go see it, 'cause it's awesome. 8.5/10",8,0,0,5 November 2003
