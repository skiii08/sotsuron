Conquest 1453," Crap
","In my whole life I haven't seen such a bad, quasi-historical movie. Even Spartacus series is good in comparison with this movie. Lot of Turkish propaganda and cheap moments. All of Turks are good. Yeah right. Constantine XI who was an exemplar of a good, Christian ruler, whose self-sacrifice was well noticed is shown as clown. The City or should I say Constantinople is shown as a town of prosperity like it was in VI century during Justinian. Also Urban was forced to work for Byzantines and was saved by the Turks ?!? Nope. Sultan Mehmed II was an intelligent man, a scholar and not some religious freak. And there is more and more flaws, that were probably made on purpose by the director and script writer. This movie is only good for avoiding and nothing more. One word - BULLSHIT!!!",1,6,12,22 May 2013
