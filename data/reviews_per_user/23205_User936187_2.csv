The Ring," Seven Days And You Will Die.
","A tape of something so strange and so disturbed was in the hands of some teenagers; Katie and her friends. After watching it, stunned by what they saw, they received a phone call saying they will die in exactly seven days. Believing the tape was some sort of twisted joke, they shrugged of the feeling and lived life as usual. But a week passed since they watched the video and all four ended up with the same fate: dead. Katie's mother, confused and shaken by the loss of her daughter, asked Rachel, her sister, to find out what really happen to their troubled girl.Now determined to solve the mystery of Katie's death, Rachel finds herself and her son, Hayden with the same fate as her niece. Can she save her life and Aidan's as well? Directed by Gore Verbinski, The Ring gives a fairly decent work of art. I applaud Gore for directing the effect of viewers sensing that they're not alone anymore from start to finish. However, I find the tape (The Death Tape, as I nicknamed it.) disturbing. It was some of the images of the finger and the suicidal horse that made me feel unusual, almost at the point of being uncomfortable.The cast was also very well picked. Naomi Watts, who played Rachel, gives a performance that will surely give her more success in her career. But what was more surprising was the work of little David Dorfman who played Aidan. He gave some excellent acting skills in The Ring. The girl who haunts the tape (Daveigh Chase who acts as Samara) gave a frightening job as well.The Ring was, I thought, more of a thrill then a horror movie, but it does frighten well. But I heed a warning to those who want to rent 'The Ring'. If you're easily disgusted, then I suggest you pick another movie to watch. To those who ignored my warning, however, will surely be pleased that they did, because it really is a one of a kind movie. I give 'The Ring' a two thumbs up well done.",7,0,0,31 December 2007
Dawn of the Dead," Wow. This movie was outrageous.
","I don't find gory movies very good. But I will make an exception for Dawn of the Dead. I recently watched it, and I just have to say that it's amazingly scary! It starts off with Ana...(a nurse from a local hospital)...waking up to one of her neighbors attacking her husband, (Luis). Not knowing what to expect, she tries her best to keep him alive. But too late, her husband was infected. He became a part of 'them'. Pratically a zombie, trying to eat humans alive! Ana panicked, and went to the bathroom to hide herself from being hurt. She tried to calm herself from what just happened. Her own husband trying to attack! Being as calm and collected as she can...went and open the door-BAM! Luis's head pops up! He twist and turned...trying to get a taste of his once called wife. Ana, on the other hand, was shocked! Her heart racing, and pounding to get outside. She ran for her car...and saw something horrifying. All hell break lose; her neighbors were all infected... I can't tell you everything that happens, but you will enjoy this movie like I did.When you watch at least 15 minutes of it...your hand will start to tremble. You get shivers and goosebumps. I guarantee you.",8,3,5,14 August 2007
