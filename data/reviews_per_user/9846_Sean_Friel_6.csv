Insidious: Chapter 2," A less scary improvement from the original instalment
","Any plot holes left by Insidious have been brilliantly addressed in the interesting sequel.The film picks up from where the first one left of. After the Lambert's son is rescued from another realm they mistakenly think they are safe from the evil forces that once haunted them.The film doesn't provide the same scares that the 2011 title provided but fills the holes that were previous left.The writing for the film is fascinating. Followers of the last film should be able to enjoy this film as it is far less frustrating.As a stand alone film Insidious: Chapter 2 may not work as the plots is complex thus you must watch the first film for the second to work.Patrick Wilson's performance as the father of the family Josh must be noted. He more than amends himself for his less than impressive performance in the previous film.Insidious: Chapter 2 is certainly fun film that will be better appreciated by horror enthusiasts. However, due to less scares casual audiences may disrespected by casual audiences.Another victory by director James Wan.",7,1,2,19 April 2020
Insidious," A bog standard horror with its fair share of fun jump scares
","Insidious, follows the story of a family who have recently moved into a new home. Their eldest son falls into a coma and with that a number of paranormal occurrences follow.The film is certainly fun. Its use of a number of different scary demons will definitely cause you to feel uneasy.Rose Byrne's role as the mother is very well executed and appears to be a natural one. Byrne's caring nature will have audiences sympathising at her situation as the family's life is thrown into turmoil.Patrick Wilson, who by observation appears to be in every other recent horror film made stars as the father in the film. Wilson's performance is unconvincing at best. You get a sense he is uncomfortable in the role which takes away from the film.There is a lot to be desired with the plot. The unoriginal approach to a haunted house and a possessed child story is one replicated far too often. The story is all over the place. It feels as if the writers have sacrificed continuity for jump scares which comes across as lazy.The idea of sleep paralysis in the film is something that personally sparked an interest. An interesting subject with little understanding the horror of sleep paralysis is very real. I'll give credit to the writers for that decision.Side characters, a lovable psychic and her comical geeky assistants do offer up a few unnecessary laughs. These characters do add to what is an non-debatable mediocre film.Insidious although poor in execution is what it is. A silly horror film that will appeal to mainstream audiences has been understandably popular. I'd certainly say it's worth the watch especially with a group as it will definitely provide a night of entertainment.Although not a classic of the genre, Insidious will certainly cement its place as a horror that will always be brought up in discussion.",5,0,0,19 April 2020
A Quiet Place," Brilliant in all elements
","John Krasinski's directorial debut A Quiet Place is an instant horror classic.The film follows a young family as they try to survive in a society that is riddled with mysterious creatures. The creatures hunt using a super heightened sense of sound rendering the family practically mute.The film is really quite captivating from the get with one of the most shocking openings to a film I've ever seen.Real life couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski who star as the parents put on flawless performances. Blunt's strong motherly instincts are beautiful. Krasinski nails the performance of a father who will do anything for his family.Millicent Simmonds, a real life deaf actress plays the role of the daughter in the film. Simmonds' performance is unbelievable, she will deserves universal acclaim. One must give Krasinski a nod for casting the young actress in a role that only someone with her disability would deserve.Plot holes can be dug throughout the film but personally hasn't spoiled the film one bit for me.With a sequel that as due to release in the April of 2020 you need to watch the first instalment sooner rater than later.Krasinski has surely set the bar for horrors to follow since.",9,0,0,19 April 2020
Rosemary's Baby," A horror trailblazer
","Rosemary's baby is a piece of cinema.The film chronicles the story of a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult wants to take her baby for use in their rituals. Rosemary's Baby deals with themes related to paranoia, women's liberation, Christianity (Catholicism), and the occult.For all that can be said about director Roman Polanski's character, his fantastic film making ability is undeniable.The acting throughout the film is first class. Mia Farrow who plays Rosemary Woodhouse is brilliant. She was able to showcase her demise so genuinely and as an audience we get a real feel for the fear she is experiencing.Ruth Gordon must also receive credit in her performance as Minnie Castevet. Minnie is a character that many audiences have probably came across in their life time but that does not make us feel any easier about her strangeness.The story throughout film is quite gripping. You are constantly questioning the fate of Rosemary. Is she insane or is there a plot to capture her baby, is her husband vying against her or disillusioned to the whole situation.Visually the film is unbelievable. Dare I say, Rosemary's baby is visually perfect. The interior of the apartment and the Gothic New York are a real treat on the eye.The film may escape the understanding of casual audiences. The film simply requires patience for full enjoyment. Its slow build is one that is greatly underappreciated, especially in the horror genre.Rosemary's baby is simply a huge milestone in the history of cinema. One would cause themselves an injustice to miss this horror masterpiece.",9,2,2,22 April 2020
The Silence of the Lambs," A MUST SEE
","I'll be honest, the story of an FBI agent interviewing a serial killer in attempt to figure out the identity of another serial killer was one that hardly excited me.For years I had heard nothing but positives about this film. Claims that it was one of the best thrillers/horrors ever made just seemed a little far fetched to me.After forcing myself to put this Jonathan Demme film on I must say it certainly exceeded expectations.The film is certainly a masterpiece in every conceivable way.The acting is first class. Sir Anthony Hopkins' performance as Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter is truly haunting. His demeanour throughout is terrifying.Jodie Foster is brilliant as Clarice Straling. Her performance as a strong powerful woman in a mans world is one before its time. Her role is one that would surely still have relevance in today's climate.Visual the film is beautiful. In an age full of CGI and Marvel films one such as The Silence of the Lambs is sorely missed. An over reliance on new technology has taken away the beauty of film making. A cliche but none the less they don't make film like this anymore.winer of 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay, speaks for itself.The Silence of the Lambs is essential viewing. I do not believe there is a person alive who would not appreciate this legend of cinema in some way or form.A film of perfect proportions.",9,0,0,20 April 2020
Mother!," Polarisingly puzzling
","This film... this film... just.. this film.Directed by Darren Aronofsky, known for films Noah (2014) , The Wrestler (2009) and Black Swan (2010), Mother is really quite something.An acclaimed poet Him (Javier Bardem) struggles with writers block whilst his younger wife, Mother (Jennifer Lawrence), spends her time renovating their Victorian home. When a fan known as Man (Ed Harris) shows up along with his family things start to go very wrong.The film is very hard to follow and after viewing you will certainly be dumbfounded. Although confusing, Mother is a very good film.The film draws narratives used in the bible. Mother represents supposedly represents Mother Earth, Him represents God. The family that visits the couple represent Adam and Eve while their two sons represent Cain and Abel. The setting of the film is said to represent the garden of Eden, whilst Jesus of Nazareth and communion is represented.In essence the film is about what people will do for the approval of God and the destruction it causes.With knowledge of what the film is really about it become much more bearable. In that sense the film is very clever and I think most viewers will be able to appreciate it.Mother is definite recommendation of mine. As a horror it has its fair share of logical scares that would make it fun for most audiences.Mother certainly does what it's meant to do.",9,0,2,27 April 2020
