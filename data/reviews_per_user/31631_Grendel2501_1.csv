Skyfall," Bond Revisited
","A little bit of old, with a lot of the new and current, and a splash of reinvention splashed in. This film was perhaps a Bond film that stands alone in it's scope, cinematography, acting and story. What is the best Bond film of all time will always be debated, but it's hard to deny how entertaining this installment was. You can clearly see how Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight heavily influenced Sam Mendes' direction on Skyfall. I love how he brought in Bond elements of films past and reset the landscape of the story going forward. Moreover, I love how we get a peak into Bond's back story, which really helps to give the character more development and depth. Most of all, Javier Bardem absolutely kills it as a villain. Definitely worth the coin.",8,2,11,7 November 2012
