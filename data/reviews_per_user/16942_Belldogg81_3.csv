Ford v Ferrari," Cor Blimey, what a Picture!
","The story of Carroll Shelby and Ken Miles gets the Hollywood treatment in this nostalgic look at the motor racing scene of the 60's. It also succeeds in harking back to the kind of films Hollywood doesn't make any more.Although this is in many ways a standard three act rise, fall and rise again narrative it's elevated by the excellent central and supporting performances. Damon is on top form as the bullish and ambitious good ol' boy Shelby. Compensating for his own enforced retirement as a driver by building up a successful race car construction company.Bale, as ever, gives a memorable portrayal as the flawed genius Ken Miles. Quick tempered but never nasty, a loveable rogue and family man whose own driving career could clearly have been one of true greatness if not for his inability to compromise or bite his tongue.The two leads rock and roll throughout proceedings, quick to clash but quick to make up again and once on board with the Ford motor company (who are desperate to end Ferrari's dominance of the Le Mans) the film really cooks.The Ford suits are played fairly stereotypically but Josh Lucas is the film's real hissable villain. Playing the smarmy exec role to perfection.Events play out much as you would expect but no less entertaining for it. Even the somewhat cliched speeches and corny English asides (all English people love cups of tea and say Cor Blimey!) Don't detract from the thrills.The racing scenes are noisy and muscular, visceral in the same way as Ron Howard's Rush and put you right in the driving seat. And the final race is the highlight. Here the story even manages a slight twist I didn't see coming and stops the film veering into well worn ground.Top notch stuff, well worth watching.",8,2,2,16 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Where was Jar Jar?
","The difficulty of relaunching the franchise in the hulking shadow of the carefully planned and continuity driven MCU is no more apparent than in this entry to the Star Wars series.What began with the crowd pleasing if somewhat New Hope retread of The Force Awakens, before the divisive but entirely welcome change of approach with The Last Jedi is capped off with a retrograde and overall deeply disappointing finale.Given the response to The Last Jedi which although flawed breathed much new life and bold ideas into the standard Star Wars formula I still found myself grimacing at the sheer amount of fanboy appeasement on display.Ironically despite the wailing from the type of people who gleefully enter Jedi as their religion on any census or application form they get their hands on, they have been strangely silent on this films biggest slap in the face to the Star Wars legacy.That occurs in the first five minutes when the return of Emperor Palpatine is confirmed. For any fans of the original films the moment of Darth Vader 'killing' Palpatine is the culmination of the story's heart and truth. That Luke was able to redeem his father from the dark side is the emotional anchor of this universe. It is ruled null and void in what is the film's most misguided plot point. Obviously the film needed a big bad and Snoke had been killed in TLJ but for me the film never recovers from it. Also the wafer thin explanation for his existence (cloning??) Is laughable and poses way more questions than it answers.In addition we have the awkward use of Carrie Fisher for whom some scenes work and some don't. Understandable somewhat obviously but surely a more heroic send off could've been written. There is an endless parade of greatest hits which the film seems built around serving rather than they serving it. Lando, Luke (disavowing his entire TLJ arc more or less) as well as smaller nods to previous films.It's not all bad Rey and Kylo have some of their best moments despite some clunky dialogue and Poe gets a bit more to do but there never feels like any real danger and the film never really sizzles like the last two did in places.The lack of stakes is again clearly so to not annoy anyone which means Chewy is only thought to have died but comes back, C3P0 permanent memory wipe is undone, Rey dies then doesn't, Kylo does, then doesn't, then does (also who knew the force could be sucked out like some kind of Sith Dyson?)There are some great moments for sure but they are few and far, far between.A sad end to a great franchise.",5,7,11,12 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Die Arbeit von Taika wird dich zum Lachen und Weinen bringen.
","In a solid year for films, particularly those at the business end of the awards season Jojo Rabbit stands out a mile. Mining the most horrific period in modern history for laughs is not to be attempted lightly. This film however manages to combine genuine belly laughs and consistent chuckles with real heart. For this alone it deserves all the praise it has received.It splices the emotion of Spielberg (without the schmaltz), the slapstick of Python (without the real silliness) and the off beat characterisation of the Coen Brothers and filters it all through Waititi's unique comedic voice.Anyone who has followed Waititi's career as I have from Flight of the Conchords through to Hunt for the Wilderpeople and Thor Ragnarok will see elements of all of these laced subtlety and more overtly through Jojo. Hunt for the Wilderpeople is probably the closest thing to a companion piece in that they are both driven by a child navigating a grown ups world and both deliver laughs and tears.If you've seen the trailer or know a little of the film then the story is basically one of Jojo, a passionate Hitler Youth member who in the absence of siblings and a father imagines himself none other than Der Fuhrer as a friend.He is of course played by the director Taiki Waititi in what can only be described a a unique take on history's worst human. The interplay between him and Jojo (played brilliantly by Roman Griffin Davis in incredibly his first film role) propels the first act as Jojo seeks to become the very model of the HitlerJugend. Bright eyed, inmocent, cherubic and full of zest he fantasies in his bedroom of glory while dressed in his uniform as any young boy the world over would do dressed as their favourite sports star or singer.We soon meet Sam Rockwell as the youth camp captain. As always he delivers, bringing a little of his character in Billboards to what is essentially the shell of a once proud Nazi no longer able to take part in combat due to an injury. He is a shambling, drunken but still wily man who manages to dole out advice to our young protagonist even though you are aware he is maybe not entirely on board with the party line.Scarlett Joahnsson plays Jojo's Mother and is utterly charming as a single parent trying to keep her child a child while keeping him safe. She is playful, tough and teaches Jojo that there's more to life than Hitler and the war. She also has her secrets which give the film it's weight and most heartbreaking scene.The real centerpiece of the film though is the relationship between Jojo and Elsa (another brilliant performance from a young actress I first seen in Leave no Trace and again excels here). Her discovery by Jojo begins to really anchor the direction of the film and is deftly played by the director as initial fear and horror are soon turned into curiosity and friendship. Much to the chagrin of Jojo's imaginary friend. (Worth noting at this point that Jojo's only real friend up to this point is Yoki who is a relentlessly optimistic delight and delivers much of the film's comic relief, even when things get really heavy).As Jojo and Elsa's relationship blooms the spectre of the war machine's most insidious parts are never too far away and it is not long before an impromptu home inspection from the local Gestapo takes place.Despite being played largely for laughs at the start it becomes genuinely tense as Thomasin McKenzie playing Elsa conveys all the inner turmoil and resilience as expertly as an actress far beyond her years. The scene drips in Pathos but as is the genius of Waititi, things are never allowed to get too heavy and we are soon chuckling again thanks to Stephen Merchant and his band of hapless goons.The film begins to draw to a close as Jojo is left bereft and begins to lose what's left of his faith in the war. He resolves to protect his Jewish stowaway at all costs. As the Red army encircle the city and break through the last of the defences the final scene plays out like an old fashioned farce with young and old alike strapped with guns and bombs they can barely carry never mind operate. In actuality anyone with a cursory knowledge of Berlin's last stand will know this isn't as ridiculous as it seems.Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf finally realises his heroic potential as the survivors (Jojo included) are rounded up by the Red Army. He knowingly creates a skirmish with Jojo which he knows will set Jojo free but result in his death. It's played brilliantly and Jojo is free to return home to his beloved Elsa.Torn between telling her the truth and risk her exercising her new freedom and telling her a lie to keep her close, his inner conflict is there for all to see. He ultimately does the right thing and they step outside together for the first time in a new Germany and much changed world. This however is not before a final reckoning between Jojo and the ghost of his imaginary friend. Hardened by what he has been through and completely enchanted by Elsa, he delivers the film's final hilarious, punch the air moment.If this does not win best picture it will not be a major surprise given the Academy's form for playing it safe with the Oscar's. But make no mistake, in years to come this will be the one people will say should have won.A triumph, Heil Waititi!!!",9,1,3,14 January 2020
