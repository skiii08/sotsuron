Requiem for a Dream," Absent: most things that make film great!
","While it is possible to see why some viewers like this movie, I have to side with those who do not. There are some fine filmic/technical aspects to the movie, and some moments of good acting, too. But the lack of imagination and nuance is numbing. All the actions and motivations are predictable, and everything the film does hits the audience with a ton of bricks, and then another ton and another and another. Only a very sheltered grade school kid could not see the plot coming for miles and miles. In the end, there was no art here, just a black hole, perhaps instructive for some, but not for others.",3,11,23,14 February 2002
