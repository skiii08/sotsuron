Black Swan," Like it
","I give this movie an 8. It was awesome and had me focused on the movie the entire time. I give it an 8 because the movie was somewhat confusing if you don't realize half of everything is based on what she is thinking. I watched it twice and I am going to watch it again. Great acting and great picture quality. The movie is not as predictable as one would imagine, and I am very good at predicting the outcome of movies. My only regret is that I wish I had went to the theater to see it, I would definitely pay the 9.25 they charge to watch this movie on the big screen with the surround sound! I would recommend it to someone looking for a suspenseful movie.",8,0,1,28 February 2011
