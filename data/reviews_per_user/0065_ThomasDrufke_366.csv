Ford v Ferrari," The Rare Crowd Pleasing Oscar Film
","Often times this time of year it's tough to find a crowd pleasing film. The blockbusters are rare and the Oscar movies are everywhere, albeit typically a 'downer' or more 'thought-provoking' than something you're on the edge of your seat for. Ford v Ferrari certainly accomplishes the latter with two winning performances, sharp direction from James Mangold, and a cheer worthy true story to base it around. Heck, this movie even had some laugh out loud humor, something Christian Bale's filmography isn't full of. I would love to see him try straight comedy at some point. In all, Mangold has another win on his hands with one of the best films of the year. Here's hoping it's honored during awards season!8.9/10",8,3,6,21 November 2019
The Benchwarmers," Typical Dugan & Sandler Led Comedy
","There comes a point when the humor in mindless comedies become painfully unfunny and borderline offensive. Benchwarmers just about gives us the worst of its leads who do absolutely nothing to liven the brutally horrendous script.I enjoy a good laugh every now and then, especially when the humor is witty and unforced. But Benchwarmers proves why I stay away from seeking out the silly comedies that Adam Sandler has built his career around. Sandler doesn't star, but his buddies Rob Schneider, David Spader, and Jon Heder do; while frequent Sandler collaborator, Dennis Dugan, directs.I can't sit here and waste my time for paragraphs ripping apart a film I clearly didn't care for, but since it has a cult following, I might as well share my thoughts. There's no denying Dugan has an audience for these ridiculous comedies, but I'm not one of them. I'm not a fan of the way he balances his entire film on tasteless jokes and dialogue that treats its viewer as unintelligent. Sure, there are a few laughs, but they come and go fast.The Benchwarmers attempts to have an important message about bullying and I commend a comedy for trying to have a message at all. But the film probably ended up offending more people than it helped. It's a film that people praise for its quotable lines and hilarious side characters, but neither can save the unintelligent feeling I got throughout the 80-minute runtime.-Lazy and silly script-Failed attempt at sending a message-Offensive3.0/10",3,0,1,17 August 2016
Blade Runner 2049," Still Not Grasping the Love For these Movies
","Having not been a fan of the original, I went into 2049 with an open mind. I was hoping to have a truly epic sci-fi experience that honors the original but also stands on its own. While 2049 does that, it still isn't resonating with me the way I think it does with most people.I honestly can't pinpoint the reason why I'm not connecting to these films. Great performances, beautiful cinematography, visceral action (in the limited action sequences), and a director at the top of his game, and I'm still not connecting the dots as to why these movies are viewed with such high regard. Granted, Roger Deakins' cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Gosling, Ford, and the rest of the ensemble all fit perfectly with their characters (see - Jared Leto for example). Villeneuve proposes some fantastic story beats that definitely separate this film thematically from the original (which was a worry I had), and yet I'm still not all the way there.I think the thing that kills me with both films is the pacing. It's not like I haven't seen science fiction films with slow pacing that I liked. Heck, Villeneuve made a great one just last year with Arrival. But there's something about how slow these films play and the material that drives them just doesn't resonate with me. Whether it's the overabundance of A.I driven sci-fi features that I've seen before these movies, the bleak tone, or the fact that I just don't really care whether or not Rick Deckard is a replicant or not, Blade Runner just isn't for me.With that said, I can always appreciate when a film is sharply put together. Just because I'm not a fan of the material, doesn't mean I can't see when a film is something special in the technical way. If there was ever a guy who should win the Oscar for cinematography, it's Roger Deakins. The man has gone on long enough without a statue. And there's nothing I can knock too much about Villeneuve's directing, even with an incredibly slow burn way of telling a story. I thought Gosling and Ford played well off each other, and gave some of the more emotional turns I've seen from either of them in quite some time. And the eerie but lively score from Ben Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer are among this year's best.However overall, I can't see myself sitting down for a second viewing. I'm perfectly content with letting other people enjoy this series. I won't blame anyone for calling this or the original a classic. But I'll pass.7.1/10",7,5,12,8 October 2017
First Man," Disappointing
","Coming off of one of the most colorful and exuberant films of the last decade with La La Land, Damien Chazelle made a grim, colorless, and just plain dull film with First Man. It's not that the trailers ever wowed me or got me super excited, but I was certainly looking forward to seeing his follow up to one of my favorite films of all time. And heck, he even brought La La Land alum Ryan Gosling along with him. The problem with First Man has nothing to do with the whole American Flag controversy that people are complaining about, nor the tone really. It's more so the fact that this script is without life or energy. It trudges along from an amazing visual sequence to the next and the pacing is just tough to get through. It's also unfortunate that the characters are not likable at all and I found it difficult to connect to Gosling's performance as Neil Armstrong. I admittedly learned a lot and the story is undeniably fascinating, but I definitely could have used a more broad scope to the movie, instead of just Armstrong and the U.S. I get that's not the story they were telling, but I felt there was something missing.6.6/10",6,1,3,21 October 2018
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," If We Burn, You Burn With Us
","Coming off one of the greatest sequels ever made it was going to be hard to wow us as much as Catching Fire did. With that being said Mockingjay Part 1 succeeds in a lot of areas. Sure many people will get bored or try and compare it to the previous installments. But the key here is that this film is very different. Don't expect to see any Hunger Games, because it's all about the rebellion. And there is quite a build up involved with part 1. I thought even though it's not entirely necessary to split the movie in two parts, I can see where it may pay off once we see the final film.Jennifer Lawrence is golden once again as Panem's symbol of hope and rebellion. She always brings her A game but she is given even more to do in this film. Her ability to showcase every type of emotion and make it feel real to us is incredible. I will say I could have cared less for either Peeta or Gale in the first two films, but Lawrence finally sold me on the relationship between those characters. Several times throughout the film I found my heart pounding and on the edge of my seat. Much credit goes to Francis Lawrence for solidifying this franchise as one of the most intense in Hollywood.Much of what makes this franchise so great is the cast. And everyone gives a great performance. Donald Sutherland gives another chilling performance. While Harrelson, Tucci, Hoffman, Banks, and even newcomers Moore and Ali are great. All of them have their fair share of memorable scenes and that will only get better in the next film.I didn't find some of the propaganda bits to work as well as they should have. With that being said, when they nail it they nail it. Back at district 8 was one of the most emotional scenes of the film, and every aspect of scene was perfect. Even Liam Hemsworth was great. I found it hard to pick apart things about the film I didn't like. It's a slow burn for sure, but like I said there are some incredible scenes in Mockingjay. I really do think when we see the final product it will all go better as one.The ending was meticulously directed. Peeta's rescue scene was among some of the most intense filmmaking I have seen all year. It even reminded me a little bit of dare I say Zero Dark Thirty in that I honestly felt like my heart was beating out of my chest and hitting the person in front of me. It's hard to do that in a film. I actually had goosebumps 3 different times. I'm not even a die hard Hunger Games fan either. I can just appreciate great filmmaking. Again, I understand people's complaints right now, I just think it will pay off next November. I will say I hope to see much more of Natalie Dormer and Jena Malone in part 2. We didn't get to see much of Malone and Dormer was one of the best parts of part 1. Although it's relatively action-less, the character drama was enough to win me over and be just as excited for next year when this epic trilogy wraps up.+Lawrence shows her chops once again +Supporting cast stands out+Francis Lawrence incredible directing +Especially in the last 20 minutes +Goosebumps throughout +Get's me more excited for the (hopefully) battle filled finale -Slow moving at times -Some propaganda bits underwhelming 8.7/10",8,14,44,21 November 2014
Vertigo," Karma, Deception, and Obsession.
","Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo. An impressive tale about obsession.In honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday, I decided to re-watch Vertigo and reevaluate just how well it holds up upon repeated viewings. There's nothing quite like the shock of watching it for the first time, but I had a chance to dig my teeth into the legendary performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak while being dazzled by Hitchcock's meticulously crafted story.One of the most impressive aspects about Vertigo is that it's clearly framed as a story about someone with Vertigo dealing with a peculiar case, but really, it's about obsession, and a man digging just a little bit too deep into a case. A theme that Christopher Nolan seemed to take into his film, Memento, in 2000. Vastly different stories, but similar execution from the director's chair.An easy way to identify a film's tone is through the score, and Hitchcock always seemed to get the best out of the legend, Bernard Herrmann. His score here is both haunting and alluring. I love the way he balanced the score with the uncomfortable feeling we get as an audience watching Stewart's character obsess, along with the noir- ish love story that forms as well.Amidst Hitchcock's mind boggling story are a few darn good performances by Stewart and Novak. Stewart, typically known strictly in likable protagonist roles, finds himself in a more complex and even unlikable alley. There's certainly times where the lines between protagonist and antagonist are blurred, but Stewart does a great job at rounding out his character. Novak, on the other-hand, plays a more mysterious role but nonetheless just as significant. Aside from the characters in Psycho, Novak may have had the most difficult time portraying just who Hitchcock desired for this role. If there was ever a Hitchcock blonde who deserved a Best Actress Oscar, I think it was Novak.Overall, Vertigo holds up just as well as the first time I watched it, and perhaps even better in some aspects. There's a reason this film is at the top of so many greatest films of all time lists.+Hitchcock's colorful direction+Stewart and Novak were at the top of their game+Herrmann's score+Themes still hold up10/10",10,4,6,13 August 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Lacks the Heart of the Original Trilogy
","After the original trilogy, there wasn't much story left to tell with Will and Elizabeth, so Disney wished to continue the franchise putting a heavier focus on Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. On Stranger Tides featured Sparrow at the center of everything, which can be a good and bad thing.I don't necessarily think it was the best idea to make Sparrow the only character with significant depth, but I also don't think having the story involve mermaids and an overly powerful supernatural villain either. The Pirates films at their best when the stakes are high but are also grounded with some realism. One of the reasons At World's End is a much better film is because there are stakes in that film. William's sacrifice feels earned because we've been with these characters for a few films. I never connected to anyone in On Stranger Tides because the writing never makes a considerable effort to flesh out the characters. The efforts that are made aren't very committed.As a standalone sequel, which is essentially what this film is, On Stranger Tides is far from awful. It has plenty of fun swashbuckling action scenes that the franchise has always presented. Ian McShane is pretty good as Blackbeard, though he doesn't really compare to anything Bill Nighy or Geoffrey Rush did in the original trilogy. But the film itself presents a far goofier tone than any of those films. Sparrow is even more over the top (believe it or not) and thus removing any human connection to the characters.I think it's best to treat this entry as a distant cousin people choose not to acknowledge at a party, because it has next to nothing to do with any of the other films (even the most recent film, Dead Men Tell No Tales). There are flashes of the Pirates we know and love but it's nowhere near as grandiose or as magical as its predecessors.+Flashes of greatness-Forgettable-Characters are getting a little too over the top5.6/10",5,0,0,27 May 2017
Howl's Moving Castle," Sweet and Charming Fantasy Adventure
","It's these types of movies that really define the fantasy genre. There's something about an animated movie that dives into your imagination that is more fascinating than actual people in a movie. Miyazaki is most definitely one of the most visually stunning directors that always seems to find the balance between great character development and large fantasy spectacle.It's loads of fun and in my opinion easier to understand than Spirited Away. Perhaps it was because it wasn't my first time seeing Miyazaki's work this time around. To me this film feels a lot like the classic tale of Beauty and the Beast. A man/creature who was put under a long spell ends up meeting the love of his life and they fight to try and resolve the everlasting issue. Although this time, the girl also has a spell placed upon her. There are great supporting characters as well, the turnip and the Calcifer are funny and sweet as helpers to Sophie along her journey.The American voices were solid and I think everyone fit their character except for perhaps Christian Bale as Howl. Bale is one of my favorite actors but his deep and grim voice didn't particularly fit with the self indulgent Howl. Other than that it's a great journey and a memorable one. Although I think the film would have benefited from about a 15 min less runtime.9.0/10",9,0,1,29 April 2014
Alien 3," Tries Hard to Kill the Franchise
","(Special Edition – Assembly Cut 2003)Alien 3 is one of those situations where the quality of the film we got is no one and everyone's fault. With a young and inexperienced David Fincher, an actress making demands, a script that was being written on the fly, and a less than compromising studio, Alien 3 is about as disappointing of an end to a trilogy as I can remember. Alien and Aliens are two entirely different films that provide tension in different ways. Alien relies on our fear of the unknown, while Aliens is a relentless action film that never lets down its guard. Alien 3 once again changes up the formula, but is inferior in every way. Slow, brooding, and lacking any excitement or tension provided from the first two makes this film only watchable because of Ellen Ripley. But even that feels tarnished due to Sigourney Weaver demanding Ripley to not hold any guns, which in turn meant the entire prison she's trapped in seem illogical. Let me get this straight, we're on a prison filled with murderers and rapists, and the guards don't have any weapons to use if things go bad? But really the problem with Alien 3 is just that there were way too many cooks in the kitchen. It seems like everyone involved had their own agenda and vision for how the story should pan out. What we got was a messy script, an uneven tone, and unfinished CGI/visual effects. Not to mention the fact that some of our favorite characters from Aliens were swept away to either glorified cameos or killed off unceremoniously. The entire production of this film was an absolute disaster. Sadly, it's hard not to think of how this film impacts some people's viewings of the first two masterpieces.There's always something to be said for taking a film series in a new direction, and Alien 3 attempts to do that with Ripley's unique relationship to the Xenomorph. But if you're going to do that, don't compromise the story or tarnish the spirit of the films that came before just to get what you want out of a threequel. In my mind, this series ends after Alien and Aliens, and begins with Prometheus. Including Alien 3 and Resurrection in the discussion is off the table. Heck, David Fincher himself has disowned the film that he directed.+The attempt at changing the feel of the third film-Messy-Poorly written-Too many cooks in the kitchen5.0/10",5,0,3,18 May 2017
Mission: Impossible III," Another twisted but better executed Mission Impossible movie
","It's definitely the best film adaptation of the Mission Impossible series yet. With JJ Abrams at the helm, you know you will get a well executed explosion type action thriller, but he also helps give us more character development than any MI movie has given us. He also gave us the best villain yet in Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Owen Davian. From the opening scene he shows us just how terrifying he can be. This movie also gave us a love interest that we can actually care about. In an action spy thriller, it's the best love interest we have had since Eva Green in Casino Royale. At times it has too many twists and turns for my liking, but the end result paid off. I was glad to see that they kept the mask pulling to a minimum this go around.It's a hugely entertaining movie and it manages to support character based drama while still staying true to the Ethan Hunt crazy stunts and the absolutely impossible missions. Hoffman is the best part of the movie, but I think Cruise gives a fantastic performance, and possibly his best spy role yet. Michelle Monaghan was also great and I cant forget to mention the great supporting cast, including that small Aaron Paul cameo. I really think the story was also the best yet for MI, but still disappointing that we never get to find out what this Rabbit Foot thing is.I think the MI franchise is heading in the right direction. I will watch Ghost Protocol soon and I am ecstatic for MI 5 next year. As long as these movies don't go too crazy like MI 2, where the masks are absolutely overused, then they will continue to make loads of money and please audiences.+Hoffman runs the film +Only a few mask pulls +better character drama then previously seen -maybe a few too many twists 8.2/10",8,1,1,3 June 2014
Your Name.," A Timeless Romance
","Your Name is yet another example of an animated film being able to transcend the typical boundaries of the genre. Just as Pixar has done several times over, Your Name constructs a gorgeous looking 90 minutes of animation, all while making a movie that can be enjoyed by children and adults. The best part is that this film goes way more layers deep than any romantic animation film I have seen, at least in quite some time. It deal with themes of death, freewill, and how time is not exactly something you can explain so easily. At its best, Your Name is a romantic thriller with deep visuals and ideas, with just the perfect amount of everything to please several parties.9.6/10",9,0,1,29 September 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Unsettling, Thrilling, and Surprising
","While I didn't see the original Cloverfield until relatively recently, I understand that it had one of the most inventive and memorable marketing campaigns of this generation. 10 Cloverfield Lane decided to do a similar thing but this time have the plot of the film stay under wraps besides a few minor details in trailers. It was one of the few times I can remember where I went into a movie knowing borderline nothing. For the day and age we live in now where trailers spoil more than half the film? That was refreshing to say the least.I'm going to try and keep the details of the plot to a minimum as I dissect this unsettling thriller. The first film is very much an adventure horror film. It really perfected the found footage take on making a film and may be the last great one we have had (besides Chronicle). 10 Cloverfield Lane is much more in the mystery vain than anything else. We follow Michelle, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, as she finds herself locked up in a cell with a few other people played by John Goodman and John Gallagher Jr without any knowledge of what's going on outside this place.If you were looking for a direct sequel to Cloverfield, this film may disappoint you. There are very little links at all to the first film, but it turned out for the better. For the most part, I didn't want to see any direct links to the first film, I was so invested in what was going on between the 3 characters back at this supposed safe house. John Goodman is very good as Howard, and that's all I'll say because you can't really say anything else without spoiling anything.The real highlight of the film comes from Winstead's strong performance. I've seen her in a few things but none that really blew me away. She was astounding as Michelle and yet another example of a capable and strong female character, something Hollywood should keep up. Bear McCreary's haunting score fits perfectly within the tone and it hits at just the right time with the film's up and down pacing. If I had an issue with the film, it would in fact be pacing. This film starts out fast but it does slow down for a long time before a thrilling final 30 minutes or so.For a first time directing, I was very impressed with Dan Trachtenberg's work here. He captured the feel of the first movie and put his own stamp on it at the same time. The minimal marketing is something I would like to see more of in Hollywood as it proved to be very effective. J.J. Abrams, you have done it again.+Tension+Mysterious plot and characters+Marketing+Score+Winstead and Goodman kill it-Pacing issues at times8.2/10",8,8,17,11 March 2016
The Finest Hours," All Life is Precious
","Now, that's what I call a good film. It may still be January, but The Finest Hours definitely doesn't feel like a film that came out in the midst of Hollywood's dumping ground month. It's directed by Craig Gillespie and stars Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, Holliday Grainger, and Eric Bana. It tells the story of one of the most daring and dangerous U.S. Coast Guard missions in history as Bernie Webber, played by Pine, led a crew aboard a motor boat to save the survivors of the splitting of the SS Pendleton.First off, it's unbelievable that this is even a true story. I constantly thought to myself throughout the film that there's no way they actually get through this alive. It's even more amazing when you see the real life pictures and records of the events in the closing credits. It's also one of those films that makes you enjoy your time away from the storms on water and appreciate every second on land. But besides the remarkable story, I got sucked in with the acting of Pine, Affleck, and Grainger. Grainger plays Pine's love interest back home in Massachusetts and at times the screen time on her can become distracting. Grainger was good in the role, but the time spent on the motor boat and Affleck's crew on the ship was much more intriguing.Another understandable complaint this film has been getting is its noticeable CGI. When you compare it to films like Life of Pi, Interstellar, or even Titanic from 20 years ago, it doesn't even come close to holding its own against those. But with its lower budget and poignant story, I think you can forgive some of its more obviously green screen moments. The film does have plenty of 'true story clichés' used to bring our emotions to the breaking point, but I never felt like they over did it. I was so enthralled with what was happening that when the film does get to its emotional climax, I had to hold back tears. That's a tribute to Gillespie's direction and the incredible score by the newly Oscar nominated, Carter Burwell.+Unbelievable story+Great lead performances+Timely score-Some CGI overstayed its welcome-Some cuts back to Grainger's character weren't necessary7.7/10",7,13,24,30 January 2016
The Equalizer," Guts Over Fear
","At 60 years old, Denzel Washington is still one of the best action stars on the planet. Can we get a Denzel vs Liam Neeson film already? Or perhaps even a team up film? I believe they are both in their 60's now so the clock is ticking. The Equalizer is a pure action film. Much like Taken, the story takes a bit of a backseat to the insane action sequences. But when you get a film as entertaining as this one, that's quite alright.Washington plays a retired agent of some sorts, who swears to not go back to his old roots and stay clean. It all changes when he sees Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a teenage prostitute, being abused. The premise is very similar to Taken, but I think the payoff for this film isn't as high as Taken. Moretz slips out of the film for the better part of 2 hours. It becomes more of a revenge film without exemplifying the reason behind the revenge well enough. I will say that the action is twice as good, but also over-the-top, as Taken. Robert (Washington) kills people in the most unnecessarily strange ways, but it's awesome. It has all the clichés of a action thriller, but yet it works. It also helps that every explosion Robert walks away from there's a great score to compliment it.The film is pretty long for not having a lot of depth to the story, but it still has a great amount of re-watchability. There aren't many memorable characters or even people you care about, besides Denzel. If they end up making a franchise out of it, I hope they add depth to the characters and bulk up the supporting cast.+Ridiculously fun action +Denzel is still a bada** +Catchy music/score-Seen the story before -No depth to the characters 7.7/10",7,1,2,26 January 2015
Skyfall," Business And Pleasure
","Skyfall was really a perfect storm for a Bond film. You have one of the best theme songs in the series' history with Adele's Skyfall, strong female characters led by the expanded presence of Judi Dench's M, and one of the best villains with Javier Bardem's Silva. I may like Casino Royale a little bit more, but it switches on a day to day basis. The important thing is that Skyfall isn't just a great Bond film, it's a great film.Right from the electrifying opening pre credits sequence it's clear we are in for a ride. It's also clear that this film will focus on M and Bond's relationship which has been so well documented in this series of films. I love that M tells Naomie Harris as Moneypenny/Eve to take the shot even though she doesn't have a clear shot. Then seeing her reaction and emotions unfold as she believes Bond to be dead. It's been clear ever since Casino Royale and through his rogue adventures in Quantum that she has a fondness and a soft spot for James. In many ways Skyfall completes the Bond origin story into the Bond we have known throughout the years to be. This film is absolutely a deviation from the typical formulaic process to Bond though. But trust me, it was a good change.Bardem as Silva showed shades of Loki and Joker in that he's always one more step ahead of MI6. He's also going after them instead of them going after him for most of the film, and in particular, he wants M. I genuinely believe Silva belongs up there with the best of the Bond villains. There's just so much emotional undertone mixed with a strange sense of humor that fits so well opposite Bond. To go along with that, I think Skyfall is probably the most emotional Bond film to date. There is a real sense of heart to this movie that most of the other entries don't have. What's more impressive is that there is still the fantastic action that we love from the series to go along with the heart and terrific character writing. This film is definitely not for every Bond fan, in fact I don't think hardcore fans would find this to be as good as the casual fan. Even though I consider myself one of those hardcore fans, I can acknowledge the deviations the film took. For one, Bond doesn't sleep with every flipping lady in the film, and two the villain doesn't have global aspirations. But that's why the film works so well, it's so fresh and exhilarating. Something I hope the franchise continues to be. Wow, and that concludes my 2 month long Bond marathon in preparation for Spectre. Here's hoping it's good!+Fantastic villain+Changed up the formula+Focused on the Bond & M relationship+Theme song+Brillaint action9.5/10",9,3,8,6 November 2015
Iron Man 3," Demons
","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Whereas the first two Iron Man films become better with repeated viewings, I think Iron Man 3 is far less re-watchable. Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the handful of defenders for the film, but the third entry just doesn't have the same spark as the first two films do. Shane Black takes the film in a much darker direction. That's fine, especially considering what Stark went through during the events of Avengers, but I think there was something missing in Iron Man 3, and I think the tone has a lot to do with that.Considering the film begins with the Eiffel 65 classic Blue (da ba dee), Iron Man 3 is a bit of a departure from the previous Iron Man films. Disappointingly, the film also doesn't contain any AC/DC songs or Ramin Djawadi's score. It does however, supply a memorable score from Brian Tyler. Besides that, all of the actors are back and the cast welcomes in Rebecca Hall, Guy Pearce, and Ben Kingsley in pivotal roles. Tony and Pepper are now living together *happily* with Happy and Rhodey not too far away.I understand people wanted the film to take a different approach after the mixed response to Iron Man 2, but this film was missing Jon Favreau's touch. Not only did he not come back to direct the film, but Happy only gets a few scenes as he's hospitalized for the majority of the run time. Don Cheadle has more action, but Tony Stark in Tennessee for the entire second act, I felt like I needed more Rhodey as well. If anything else, the problem with Iron Man 3 is the writing. Downey and Paltrow still have magnetic chemistry, but everything else feels different from the previous entries.That brings me to the infamous Mandarin reveal. I actually don't have as much of an issue with the direction they took Kingsley's character as everyone else does. With that said, I can't say I wasn't at least a little disappointed that there was no real presence of the ten rings or anything that felt all that threatening. I'm glad they decided to have a villain not in an Iron Man type suit to give Tony something different to fight, but as great as Guy Pearce is in other films, he just didn't do it for me as Aldrich Killian.There is definitely something to the argument that this film needed more Iron Man. Ty Simpkins plays Stark's tech sidekick back in Tennessee, and he's good, but I would have liked to see a little bit more Iron Man screen time. But the counter argument to that would be that Tony Stark is just as entertaining as the metal head himself. And that the insomniac Stark they were going for, kind of makes sense. The central theme of 'demons' was an interesting take and probably the most necessary one at that particular stage in the universe. I can appreciate the gutsiness by the filmmakers to approach the character in this way, if only The Incredibles hadn't really done the exact same premise 9 years prior.Overall, I really like Iron Man 3. It's a much different take on Tony Stark and it was the next logical step for the Marvel Universe. I just wish the writing had been more in the vein of the first two Iron Man's and not strayed too far away from what we love so much about this character.+Insomniac Stark+Fully functional Pepper & Tony+Tyler's score+Cheadle gets more action-Different approach to the villains didn't pay off-Needed a bit more humor7.8/10",7,0,1,1 May 2016
Deepwater Horizon," An Emotional Thrill Ride
","Deepwater Horizon is the first of two Peter Berg directed films this year, and if Patriots Day is anywhere near as good as this film we could be looking at quite a few nominations for Berg come February.Deepwater Horizon tells the story of the crew members of the rig of the same name in April 2010, when the largest oil spill in U.S. history began. Berg is always a guy to count on with this type of harrowing true story. He has the skills of an action film director while also having the delicate hand for an emotionally powerful touch. And much like the recently released 'Sully', this film is a strong tale about the power of the human spirit.Putting Battleship aside, Berg has always had a knack for directing high intensity sequences of trauma and thrills. Even taking that note into a smaller scale with Friday Night Lights, Berg is great at managing to balance intensity and emotion. Deepwater Horizon is perhaps his biggest scale film thus far, but it's also incredibly personal as well. It stars Mark Wahlberg, Kurt Russell, Gina Rodriguez, and Kate Hudson. All of them get the opportunity to act in small intimate moments as well as physically demanding scenes. Usually, it's those small moments that bring the emotions out of me, and that was Kate Hudson here. I feel like she hasn't gotten a lot to do since her breakout with Almost Famous, but this may be the best she's been since. She plays Wahlberg's wife, and it's simply her reactions to the devastation on the oil rig while she's at home, that really got to me. Powerful stuff.With all that said, sometimes the high octane thrills feel to be heightened just for heightening certain situations. Berg never loses sight of the end goal here, but some 'action'-ish scenes are almost a little too much, considering how contained this story feels. It doesn't take you out of the film, but you will feel like it could have been handled differently.Like Berg's previous film, Lone Survivor, it does a nice job of honoring those who died at the rig and the families severely affected by the tragedy. It's a powerful film with gripping performances from Hudson and the rest of the cast that will likely lead it right into the awards season come winter time.+Berg's delicate touch+Hudson+Devastating-Some heightened moments8.6/10",8,38,63,30 September 2016
Resident Evil: Afterlife," What is Even Going on at This Point?
","They call these films video game adaptations for a reason. They are meant to be adaptations and not just another installation into that franchise. 'Afterlife' feels way more like video game on screen than it does a film by itself.The film begins with CGI filled action sequenced that is flooded with unnecessary slow motion camera work. It's filmed in 3D, so I guess Paul W.S. Anderson was really wanted to exploit that version of the medium and give the audience it's most visceral film to date in the franchise. While there are some moments of brilliant B-movie fun, 'Afterlife' is just more of the same. And sadly it feels like some scenes are ripped right from the video games without any extra CGI or effects done.As if you weren't already tired of the Umbrella Corp being at the forefront of each and every one of these films, they once again make their unwelcomed presence felt. Minus Dr. Isaacs and now adding pretty much the exact same character in Albert Wesker, the Umbrella Corp doesn't do anything they haven't already done in the series. Seriously, in every film Umbrella spies on Alice & company, attempt to take her down, and have a big confrontation towards the end. Besides a rotating supporting cast, the films are all structured the same way. There's a real lack of creativity here.There's one clear reason why these films are made. Money. The filmmakers know how to produce these features and get people to spend their hard-earned cash on them. I enjoy a silly action adventure as much as the next guy, but there needs to be a little more effort put forth before I can actually certify these as guilty pleasure movies. As of now, they're mindless blood & guts action-horror films. However, the way this movie ends got me undeniably a little bit excited to sit down and watch the next one.+Some fun action scenes-But mostly too CGI filled for my liking-Same old story over and over again4.5/10",4,0,4,4 February 2017
It," Blending Horror and a Heartfelt Story
","I always find it difficult to get scared when a horror film stays strictly in the supernatural realm. Luckily, 'It' blends a freaky supernatural-like villain in Pennywise the clown, mixed with some seriously psychological thrills that the Loser Club goes through. Perfectly balancing some thought provoking horror with a heartfelt story, 'It' delivers on almost every level, and gives us one of the best Stephen King adaptations of all time.I've said it before and I'll say it again, the most important thing in a film is the story and the script that services that story. It all starts with the character, and the characters here are written so well, particularly in the loser's club. When you're making a coming of age film, it's very easy to fall into the trap of clichéd Hollywood high school talk between young kids hanging out, which to be completely honest, is the easiest way to lose an audience. However, 'It' plays it far more realistic. Of course, that could backfire, but the interplay between the various kids in this film makes for some hilarious moments. And that's the main reason why the scares later in the movie work so well.I bought into all of the relationships and therefore, worried for the characters when Pennywise does his tormenting. His tormenting, by the way, is downright terrifying. Not necessarily jump-out-of-your-seat scary like some horror films, but visually striking for the audience, and scarring for the characters involved. I'm not going to have nightmares, but living through the characters makes for a terrifying experience nonetheless. Speaking of Pennywise, he does some pretty messed up things to the kids in this movie, and in order to be that satisfying with the scares, you needed that R rating. There are quite a few scenes that I won't be able to get out of my head because they were so dang visually unique. I should give a few words to recognize the director, Andy Muschietti, who has done a little directing before this, but nothing as mainstream as 'It'. I'll definitely be on the look-out for his work now, and hopefully he hops on board to direct chapter 2 as well, because his work here is truly impressive. Managing to direct teenage actors to the likeness that he did, making an iconic character come to life as well as he did with Pennywise, and balancing horror and a heartfelt story are all incredibly difficult but yet he made them look so easy. So great directing, visually distinct style, rapid pace, well-written characters, and one terrifying clown makes for one of the best horror films of the last few years. 'It' is absolutely tremendous.9.5/10",9,4,11,9 September 2017
Hereditary," Unsettling But Far From 'Scary'
","After much scrutiny came down on A24 for releasing the 'misleading' 'It Comes Out at Night' last year, another critically acclaimed horror film hit theaters, 'Hereditary'. This one, about an extremely unlucky or perhaps cursed family, which life unravels for after the grandmother passes away. In many ways, Hereditary is a strikingly bold drama with fantastic performances. However, in others, it's a disappointingly un-scary horror. I fall somewhere in between these two fronts. The performances are definitely something to behold, particularly Toni Collette, who very well may have given an Oscar worthy turn as a loving but troubled mother of two, as well as Alex Wolff's haunting turn as her son. This movie contains perhaps a few of the most unsettling things I have ever seen on screen, including a prolonged scene involving a car and Alex Wolff that has to be the most impressive scene without any dialogue I've seen in 2018. But with all that said, the movie turns into something in the 3rd act that I hoped the film was going to avoid but ended up falling right into. Of course, a director and writer's vision should go where they want it to go, and A24 has always done a great job of providing the filmmakers with the path to execute their specific vision. But I was really wanting the film to go a certain way, and when it didn't and took (in my opinion, a more predictable and cliched approach), I was disappointed. Sometimes all it takes is a film to separate from your expectations for it to bum you out. Hereditary is a well-made film with some real horror and Oscar worthy performances, but it's moreso a drama that dips into cliched horror towards the end of the movie. I hate comparing two completely different movies, but The Witch is a far better option.7.0/10",7,1,2,21 June 2018
Lifeboat," Under the Radar Thriller
","Lifeboat is one of the few Hitchock films that has just flown under the radar for a long time that I finally just decided to sit down and watch it. And honestly, it's a film that has flown under the radar for decades, probably due to the success of his later films. It manages to present interesting racial and societal stereotypes in a refreshing way, something that in 1944, was highly controversial. But luckily, for the most part Lifeboat doesn't let stereotypes drive the plot. It tells a story full of twists and turns, all told on one small boat after a deadly shipwreck. Great performances and a tight direction from Hitchcock give the film a ton of life (pun intended), and still relevant to this day.7.3/10",7,0,0,9 July 2018
Training Day," Haunting tale
","Impression- This is a very well written film about a man who is taken under the wings of a sketchy and untrustworthy cop. I really enjoyed the dynamic between Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington, and I'm glad they both got nominations for their work here. After seeing Hawke in the 'Before' trilogy I know he can do dramatic roles and it goes without saying that Washington can act. The only thing I was worried about was that this movie may have that over the top action like some movies similar to this do. I was not disappointed.Praise- Its a high octane thrill ride from the beginning till end. I cant say I didn't predict Washington setting Hawke up, but its still for the most part un-expecting and very interesting. It was one of the first times Washington played a complete bad-ass on screen, and he played it well. I totally bought into Hawke's character being frightened by Washington and him daring to do all the crazy stuff that he is 'supposedly required to do'. There were also some great cameos by great actors playing small roles. Tom Berenger and Eva Mendes are barely present, but their presence is felt. This movie also has a high re-watch-ability factor. Particularly for the banter that goes on between the lead characters.Complaints- To be honest I felt that some things were unrealistic. Such as the bullets in Alonzo's car. You mean to tell me that nobody at the crime scene happened to notice the bullets in the rear view windshield? I also find it hard to believe that for over 10 years this man got away with going outside the law to put away criminals. But it is a movie, so anyway....Good movie overall with a memorable dynamic between the leads. Very pleased with the outcome.8.3/10",8,1,1,28 March 2014
John Wick," I'm Thinking I'm Back
","John Wick is one of those few movies a year that seemed like it would be absolutely terrible, but when you finally sit down and watch it, turns out to be incredible. Not only is it one of the most fun films of the year, but it's so much different than the action films we have today. It doesn't try to be inventive or over-the-top, it just plays to it's strengths.I have never been a huge fan of Keanu Reeves. Even in The Matrix, which is a great film, his acting falls pretty flat to me. He hasn't showed me anything that can make him a true thespian on screen. But as John Wick, he's perfect. The role doesn't call for anything more than just being a likable bada**. Wick is a man dealing with the death of his wife and retirement of his past associations with assassins of sort. He finally feels like he get's closure with his wife and then it's all ripped away from him by the very gangsters he was once affiliated with. He goes on an absolute killing rampage. To say the body count adds up is an understatement. Wick goes to great lengths to find the people who took everything from him, but it's not exactly easy for him. Being someone who just came out of retirement means you may be a little rusty, well Wick is definitely that. That's one of the many things I appreciated about this film. It never seemed like he was blowing through these guys without danger. Sure he effortlessly kills plenty, but he also struggles with a few as well.Killing a cute little dog would tick off anyone, so I don't blame the character for being mad, but I'm not sure there needed to be this many deaths. There are plenty of innocent security guards who die at the hands of Wick. At times, it just felt like a little too much for a revenge film. But I really loved all of John's interactions with people from his past. They all seem to be as surprised that Wick is killing again, as we are that this film turned out to be good. I thought it was a nice touch that the police officer simply let the fact that there were a bunch of dead people in Wick's apartment, go. Alfie Allen plays the main villain, and it seemed as though his storyline is very similar to that of Game of Thrones. He's constantly under-appreciated and so he wants to prove himself, but ends up doing something terribly stupid. It was also nice to see Bridget Regan from Agent Carter briefly pop up.But besides the fact that the script was pretty weak and the body count was pretty high, the film is just awesome. The 'Drive' sounding music and score to go along with the breathtaking action sequences made for one helluva ride. Keanu Reeves should stick to these less demanding and fun action roles. Just don't try and do too much.+Stunts & action +Score/soundtrack +Reeves makes it believable+Villains aren't stupid -Body count -Weak script 8.4/10",8,39,62,24 February 2015
Chinatown," As Little As Possible
","I have really been on my film noir game as of late. Although Chinatown isn't technically film noir, it's most definitely neo noir. It possesses the same sort of qualities as a great 40's film noir just with color and updated issues. Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway star as a private investigator and a recent widow respectively. Of course, the two cross paths and form an unlikely bond over a recent tragedy. But as always with noir films, there's so much more to the plot that unravels.I will say for the most of the film I felt like I needed more of a back-story with Nicholson's character Jake Gittes, but after watching the film as a whole, I definitely think it worked. The point is you don't need to know exactly what went down in Chinatown years before. You just need to know there's a history there. Nicholson brings an incredible amount of experience but also relatability to Jake. He's the kind of guy that you don't necessarily agree with the things he does but you end up rooting for him anyway. Dunaway on the other hand plays Evelyn much more guarded. There was a point in the film where she said 'lets just drop the whole thing' where I knew there was much more to her character. Isn't there always with female characters in noir's? The film deals with plenty of controversial subjects that are still prevalent now. Adultery, rape, and even a little bit of abuse. I never thought the film exploited these issues or glorified it, but it was definitely noticeable. But for the most part, it worked to the film's climatic advantage. I did have a problem with Jerry Goldsmith's score though. Goldsmith, who is one of the greatest composers of all time, seemed to struggle with consistency. It went in and out with loud and intense moments but then wasn't noticeable for several scenes at a time. I just found it to be distracting. But of course the most famous part of Chinatown is the ending. Which turned out to be one of the more shocking endings I have seen in a long time. An ending that definitely saved the film for me.+Nicholson & Dunaway's performance +Mysterious characters +Ending+Script -Score 8.8/10",8,0,1,30 March 2015
Rocketman," The Movie this Summer Needs
","At this point, I can't really imagine this movie starring Tom Hardy, who was originally attached years ago. In many ways, it feels like Taron Egerton was born to play Elton John. In fact, some may say, myself included, that this is a better performance than Rami Malek gave as Freddie Mercury last year (also partially directed by Dexter Fletcher). Egerton sings and dances on his own and commits to this completely fantastical rendition of the acclaimed singer/songwriter. Although, in many ways it follows the same beats as a cliched music biopic, when it breaks out into song and Egerton spends time breaking down the character emotionally, 'Rocketman' entertains like no other. This is the type of summer movie we needed this year.8.3/10",8,2,4,19 June 2019
A Star Is Born," 'Talent's everywhere, but having something to say and a way to say it, that's a whole other bag'
","The 4th rendition of the classic 'A Star is Born' story is perhaps the best and most realistic take on celebrity, addiction, relationships, and what it means to be a star in world of Hollywood. Essentially what became Bradley Cooper's baby, working on it for years, the 2018 version of A Star is Born is nothing short of magnificent. Written, produced, directed, and starring Cooper (who may very well get an Oscar nomination for all 4 of those), this is the sort of movie that defines you and I think it will with Cooper. It's a great script and it's well produced, but the real accomplishment here is with his directing and acting, and specifically his acting. I've never seen Cooper give a better performance than he does here, and as of now, he should win the Oscar. I have yet to see several movies up for the race this year, but I was blown away by the depths of his performance as Jackson Maine, the alcoholic and aging singer who discovers Ally's (Gaga's) talent in singing. The strength of the movie (as in the original 1937 version) lies with the chemistry between Gaga and Cooper. They are perfect together in this movie. Whether it's having a drink at a bar where Cooper touches Gaga's nose (yes, that happens and it's completely normal), walking around in a supermarket, or just sitting and talking, their relationship feels real with emotional weight and gravitas. These aren't characters, they are real people. Watching that unfold and unravel at times is where the magic in this movie is felt the most. Oh and the songs are great. Just catchy enough where I want to replay them, but not catchy enough to be annoying and overplayed on the radio. This was a true cinematic feat from Cooper and I sure hope it makes some serious noise come Oscar season.9.5/10",9,2,5,10 October 2018
Gravity," Best space film i've seen.
","I will be the first to admit that the first trailer I saw for Gravity (I believe during Man of Steel) I was not impressed. In fact I was turned off and told my friends 'how can this be a good movie, the whole movie was in space, people won't be able to relate to these characters. Even after seeing the second trailer and finding out it was only 90 minutes long didn't help to convince me. What sold me was when James Cameron said 'its the best space film ever made!'. When the man who did Aliens and Avatar, two of the biggest sci-fi movies ever says that, you know this movie is nothing short of fantastic. It was, there isn't a lot you should know going into the movie other than the special effects are impeccable. SEE IT IN 3D!! I don't see many movies in 3D because I believe unlike most people, it actually takes away from the experience. But this movie is a true spectacle, not many movies about choosing life or accepting death can be great in only 90 minutes. This is the best feature film in 2013 so far and should win a few Oscars. Sandra Bullock is good as 'stone' in a role that was originally offered to Marion Cotillard. And Clooney is in his comfort zone as 'kowalski'. There really isn't any other cast members in the movie, so enjoy the ride as it is, a true cinema masterpiece. This is what films can be, and should be for years to come. Bullock goes through many ups and downs in this movie and all I can say is that the trailers don't show you all you will get. Yes it's all in space, but it rightfully is. The long scenes are what really show how great the cinematography is. Most importantly the first scene shows how great CGI is now. Sitting with a crowd in which there are so many scenes with each person shaking their head and jumping out of their seat at the screen show how much emotional pull this movie can have on people even with a simple script. 10/10 best film of the year.",10,4,6,4 October 2013
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Still Holds Up
","I don't think I was of the right age to appreciate Monty Python and the Holy Grail when I first watched it. It takes a certain kind of mindset to be ready for the extravagant humor that these guys bring, and boy was I ready this time for Life of Brian. Insane, irreverent, and offensive humor are just sprinkles on top of this wonderfully ridiculous adventure comedy. Heck, this is a spoof of a biblical film with a spaceship that pops in for about 30 seconds, a stoning scene that just keeps getting funnier and funnier, and a joke about male genitalia that somehow holds up 40 something years later. This is one of the funniest films of all time.9.5/10",9,2,4,24 August 2019
Wind River," What a Start For Taylor Sheridan
","Crime dramas have always been one of my favorite genres of filmmaking, especially the ones that take themselves seriously and pose interesting questions about life. Wind River takes the genre up in the cold, snowy tundra of the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. Gritty, brutal, and well-timed action, Wind River builds a simply structured crime film into an important conversation about missing persons with a great storyteller and one great cast.Coming from writing the likes of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Taylor Sheridan is really making a career for himself. It's hard to imagine it's the same guy who made those short acting cameos in Veronica Mars back in the day, but Sheridan is separating himself from the pack in terms of his writing skills. I won't say that Wind River reaches the heights that either of his other two writing efforts did, but the sheer power of the subject matter of this film may take this film into Oscar season.Jeremy Renner stars as Corey Lambert, a man with a tragic past, teams with Jane Banner (an FBI agent played by Elizabeth Olsen) to solve a murder. It's easy to label Banner as the 'out of place woman who needs the help of a hardened man', because it can appear that way at first glance. But I'll view it as two people who cross paths with each other and end up working together to better their current situations. It also doesn't hurt that both Renner and Olsen have pre- established chemistry from the Marvel films, and dynamite together on screen.However, I do believe that Sheridan could have done a slightly better job of directing the tone of Wind River. There were times where it seemed the actors were giving endearing performances and monologues, only to be sometimes interrupted by a subtle joke or a lighthearted comment. I think that just a minor change in direction of his actors would have changed those moments for the better. With that said, Sheridan's brutal touch of action when the film calls for it is impressive to say the least. It's those moments that helps put a realistic layer to Wind River.Overall, Wind River is a grounded but moving take on murder, rape, and missing persons cases. Solid performances, sharp script, and nuanced storytelling, Wind River is a fascinating crime drama.8.0/10",8,102,132,19 August 2017
Erin Brockovich," 'I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it. '
","Erin Brockovich is one of those films that without it's star, it wouldn't nearly be as good. In fact I would go as far as saying without Julia Roberts as Erin Brockovich this film just doesn't work. Sure the character and Robert's portrayal can be a bit over dramatic at times, but Roberts presence is felt every time she graces the screen.Julia Roberts is widely known as one of the biggest movie stars of all time, and probably the most popular female of the last 30 years. But she's no slum acting wise. She garnered her Oscar win for this role, and rightfully so. She has some all-time great scenes, and I mean all-time great scenes. She is great at giving us dramatic moments with a bit of comedy mixed in. Her numbers moment with Aaron Eckhart was hilarious and her 'presents' speech to the lawyers was just as entertaining. Albert Finney had great chemistry with Roberts and gave just as great of a performance, but that's typical for Finney.With as much as the film focuses on Brockovich's devotion to giving her children the best possible life, I didn't particularly find the relationship fulfilling. I don't blame Eckhart for leaving for awhile either, sure she helped hundreds of people but her family was in need of a mother and she wasn't there for them. Whether or not that was put in the movie for dramatic purposes or not, who knows. There are quite a few really emotional moments that may or may not evoke tears. But it's a tribute to the performances and quality of directing that Soderbergh gave us.+Robert's Oscar winning performance +Albert Finney's understated performance +Legitimately emotional +Iconic scenes....numbers numbers numbers -Family relationship 8.0/10",8,0,0,18 November 2014
Unbreakable," Before It's Time
","Perhaps seeing this after 2017's Split removed some of the intended impact of that films surprise ending, but I'll always contend that Split wasn't a good film before that twist anyway.But in terms of Unbreakable, it turned out to be a decent film after all. If you remove the obviously pretentious (and frustratingly unnecessary) camera movements, then you have a fascinating and original character study that just so happens to feel like a comic book film. It's slow building and dated in some areas but the concepts that M. Night proposes are interesting, especially in the eyes of a 2000 era filmmaker. You know, before the golden age of superhero films.I liked it more than I thought, it's just too bad the other two films in the series didn't hit the highs that Unbreakable did.7.4/10",7,0,0,31 January 2019
Star Trek," Star Trek Reinvigorated
","Plenty Star Trek super fans stand by the notion that the rebooted/re-imagination that J.J. Abrams brought us in 2009 should not be considered canon or even a part of the franchise. I tend to believe Abrams did right by the franchise's history and pathed the correct way to take the series.That's not to say the film doesn't ask its audience to take some leaps of faith, they certainly do. Beginning with an entirely new cast of actors playing iconic characters. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto, Zoe Saldana, Karl Urban, John Cho, Simon Pegg, and the late Anton Yelchin surrounded the film with impressive young talent. Luckily, they all fit right in with the actors who previously played the crew of the Starship Enterprise, while also bringing a fresh new face to the front of the franchise.Much like 2015's The Force Awakens, J.J. Abrams took a relatively simple and safe approach to revamping the series with Star Trek. Take the villain for example, Nero, he's a vengeful leader of a race who demands payback against those who wronged him. In this case those people are one, in Spock. Though Eric Bana is unrecognizable and quite good as Nero, he's sort of an antagonist doing antagonistic things just so that Kirk and Spock can have something to overcome.As it is a re-imagining of sorts for the crew, we get to see Spock, Kirk, and even Uhura in places we've never seen them, both physically and emotionally. I particularly enjoyed the much more involved Uhura, though I'm not sure she needed to have a romantic relationship with Spock. But it does also provide us with a more unplugged version of Spock, though obviously still emotionally guarded. In all, the characters still feel like the same old Enterprise characters from the old films and series, just with a fresh spin. And that's okay Trek fans.Of course, there are quite a few gaps in the storytelling. After a highly emotional beginning with a great expanded cameo from Chris Hemsworth (up and comer at the time), I don't think the film ever reaches those gut punching heights, so from that angle, the film doesn't necessarily succeed. At other times, events happen that aren't explained well enough and warrant perhaps too much suspension of disbelief. With that said, once Leonard Nimoy steps into the film, everything begins to make a bit more sense and the entire film takes a leap forward in quality as well. It just takes a little bit to get to that point. This Star Trek reboot is far from perfect, but it's certainly nowhere near the 'dismal' quality some 'Trekkies' deem it.+The Kirk and Spock relationship is the krux of the story+Uhura's role amped up+J.J. reinvigorated the series-Some conveniences-Never hits the emotional heights of the first segment8.0/10",8,1,3,20 July 2016
Fury," It's Called War
","Even though Fury is not based off of any source material, it had it's moment of reality mixed in with many far-fetched moments. It's a highly entertaining World War II drama that although can be exaggerated, turned out to be a very solid film. The cover presents a quote that it's the best war film since Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. That's a lot to live up to, especially in an age where we feel like we have seen all types of war films. Fury takes a different approach to the genre. It follows a crew of men who strictly work in tanks. Not only do you get a feel for the comradery that exists between soldiers, but you get a sense of the extreme conditions and hardships these men went through on a day to day basis.The acting is really solid across the board. Brad Pitt is great as usual, but the real praise goes to Logan Lerman and Shia LaBeouf. These young actors surprisingly hold their own next to Pitt, Pena, and Bernthal. I was really impressed with David Ayer's script, especially the scenes involving the whole crew in the tank. There are moments of weakness though. Including some inconsistencies with Pitt's character, Wardaddy. At times he is completely against killing women and children, the next he is yelling at Lerman for sparing the lives of Nazi children. Or even the fact that it doesn't make much sense why Lerman was put into this situation in the first place. It was just mentioned as a 'mistake'. There is also a lack of female characters, besides one elongated dinner scene. It makes me wonder about Ayer's writing for Suicide Squad. Especially as DC's most famous female super-villain, Harley Quinn, is in his hands.The production design looks great. The filmmakers really give you a feel of what Germany looked and felt like in the 1940's. With that being said, for some reason the bullets special effects really bothered me. They looked green and red at times, reminding me of a Star Wars film. It's a small complaint that is likely nitpicking, but if it's noticeable it's worth mentioning. Steven Price's score is noticeably his style, which worked both for and against him. His score went from being awkwardly unfit for WWII, to being emotionally powerful. But this all leads to the terrific finale. If you didn't care for the first 3/4 of the film, they make a point for you to care about the ending. Once again, a few far-fetched moments don't go unnoticed, but it's still an enjoyable film.+Lerman & LeBeouf +Production design +Ayer's script +Finale -Character inconsistencies -Special effects iffy 7.1/10",7,0,4,2 February 2015
As Good as It Gets," Not Overstating It
","There are some films that just wouldn't be the same without it's lead actors, well As Good as it Gets is one of those films. Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both won Oscars for Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly respectively. Udall should be a very unlikable character for all the offensive and despicable things he does, but it's because of Nicholson's charm and charisma that makes you root for him. Hunt does the same with single mother who just wants to provide for her sick son. It's an unlikely combination but one that turns into one of the sweetest romantic comedies of all time.The story is somewhat like Gran Torino in that it's a man who that finds everyone and everything around him to be annoying. Udall is racist, sexist, homophobic, and also has OCD. Of course, there's a lot more to Melvin than seen on the outside. He just has a difficult time showing how much he cares. Some of the sweetest and most satisfying moments of the film involve him complimenting the people he had spent the entire film hating. Greg Kinnear plays Simon, his gay neighbor, and has his fair share of quarrels with Melvin. It's really not till the road trip between Carol, Melvin, and Simon that the three really find their groove. It's three people all with problems but they each find a way to help one another. Sometimes they don't even realize what they're doing is helping but eventually they get there.As Good as it Gets is a bittersweet film about acceptance and dealing with your own problems with the help of others. The performances, script, Hans Zimmer's score, and directing are very good. It's one of Jack Nicholson's best.+Lead performances +Score +Bittersweet story +Ending 9.2/10",9,1,1,3 April 2015
Darkest Hour," We Shall Never Surrender
","Oscar season is always a fun time to review movies. More often than not, you'll be able to talk about a great movie with many award caliber aspects. In many ways it has surpassed 'blockbuster-summer-season', partially because blockbusters are more spread out now, but there's nothing like being able to go see this many different great films in the theater in consecutive days. Darkest Hour is another film in 2017 that will surely be talked about on March 4th, and probably for one specific reason, Gary Oldman.Darkest Hour is a solid film all around, and there's nothing inherently wrong about it, but Oldman's performance stands far above anything else that you could say he overshadows his own film. Maybe that's because I'm just so excited that he may finally get his time to shine on an Oscar stage after being overlooked countless times, or maybe it's because a lot of the material in Darkest Hour tends to lean in the area of political conversation. Naturally a film about Winston Churchill will deal with politics, strategy, and patriotism, which is always difficult to encapsulate on screen without boring audiences. Luckily, Darkest Hour handles that side of things relatively well. Granted, there are some moments I did feel my interest drifting a little bit, but Oldman's performance is easily the most engaging part.The supporting actors are also impressive in their own right. Stephen Dillane, Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, and Ronald Pickup all play solid counterparts to Oldman's churchill. What helped them is not being very well known actors and hence being able to disappear into their respective roles. Whereas Oldman, who is iconic in his own right, is challenged with becoming someone who most everyone knows about in a very famous prime minister to England at the heart of World War II. It's not exactly a task just any actor can do, and Oldman does it to perfection.As I mentioned above, Darkest Hour isn't necessarily a movie I'll ever re-watch and one could make the argument it's a very formulaic biopic. Be that as it may, there's more than enough that comes from the performances of Oldman and the supporting roster that elevates the film to an Oscar conversation.7.7/10",7,1,6,22 December 2017
Monster," Humanizing a Killer
","One of the hardest things to do is made a typically unsympathetic character sympathetic. Monster deals with a famous serial killer from the early 1990's who believed she was killing for good reasons. Finding a way to write a direct such a character so that the audience doesn't automatically despise your lead is a difficult thing to do. Patty Jenkins and Charlize Theron found a way to do just that with Aileen Wuornos. The story deals with Aileen, who has had a rough life to say the least. She's been a prostitute since an early teen, physically abused by her family, and has been homeless for years ever since being kicked out of her home. Just by hearing that, there's at least some sense of pity I feel for her. This all leads to her meeting Selby Wall (based on Tyria Moore). The film portrays both of them at a rough patch in their life, which makes it all the more timely that they meet each other. After a relatively sweet romance for the first 40 minutes of the film, Aileen begins her crime spree. We may never know exactly how it all went down, but if she originally killed first victim because he was raping her and likely going to murder her, then I can feel a lot of sympathy towards her. As I said, Jenkins makes a choice to present Aileen as a victim herself, but that changes about halfway through. But I really appreciate the balance Jenkins gives to the crimes. They aren't faceless crimes without purpose, she's doing them for love and because her life is close to worthless without the money she's getting. By no means does that dismiss her from having any guilt, as no one should be murdered, but you can begin to understand her mindset just a little bit. It doesn't hurt that you have a great actress like Charlize Theron to build your film around, as she earned an Oscar for her turn as Aileen. It was well deserved I may add. Overall, Monster is a fascinating movie to get inside of a murderous psychopath, but it's more the moments of humanity in Aileen that stand out the most.7.4/10",7,0,0,27 July 2017
The Maze Runner," Is It Greeny on the Other Side
","For a film that is budgeted at merely 34 million dollars, this film visually looks really good. For comparison, Fantastic Four had a budget of 120 million and the effects and so called 'set pieces' were awful. This is one of the biggest problems with Hollywood, but that's a discussion for another day. The Maze Runner is actually a surprisingly entertaining movie. For an age in which the medium is flooded with young adult novels and movies, the film feels fresh and isn't overwhelmed by clichés like so many others are.It's led by a relatively unknown cast. Dylan O'Brien, from Teen Wolf fame, is thrown into a maze structure along with a few dozen other young men who soon find there is more to the maze than they were led to believe. Let me be the first to say I think O'Brien has some chops and definitely has a future in this business. The role doesn't require a ton of range, but I think he proved he can lead a huge action film, and not many actors can say that. The writing itself I thought could have been a little smarter and more mature. Will Poulter, who played a much different character in We're The Millers, was solid in the role that was given to him. But the writing had him doing some really stupid things and was full of forced dialogue I felt.With that being said, the mythology behind the story is pretty interesting. And they made the film into a more traditional monster film than I'm sure the book originally called for, but it really works. The horror element to the film was by far the most intriguing, and had the biggest payoff. The 'Greavers' also proved to be pretty terrifying, something I didn't think I would say about a film with a bunch of teenagers. So I really only watched this because I'm probably going to see the sequel this weekend, and i ended up enjoying the movie. Plus, having Littlefinger as the next villain gets me pretty excited.+Monster flick+Surprisingly well acted+Suspensful-Some stupid dialogue7.2/10",7,11,16,13 September 2015
Memento," Memory Vs. Imagination
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Christopher Nolan has a neat way of presenting high concept ideas that all of us have thought about but not quite understood, and bringing them to the big screen in a highly entertaining way. Memento is quite possibly Nolan's most thought provoking film. It tells the story of a man who was injured during the murder of his wife and has short term memory loss. Only of course the film isn't told chronologically. It is told in two ways. The black and white scenes move forward but are of his past. While the color scenes are more present but are told backwards. When they meet we have the end. I have seen many films that take concepts like this and fail to truly entertain and are more artsy than audiences would like. Nolan mixed brain power with a unbelievably entertaining thriller.Leonard's main goal is to find and kill his wife's killer, only with short term memory loss he has trouble remembering clues or even if he has already killed the man. He has tattoos to remind himself of his daily goals and who or who not to trust. While all this is going on, flashbacks tell the story of Sammy Jankis who suffered from the same disease as Leonard and supposedly kills his wife unwillingly because of it. The more and more the story progresses we begin to question everything we think we know about the character(s). As the color scenes are told subjectively we begin to find out more and more objective things once the scenes move backwards more. Where as we are told Leonards black and white scenes through an objective lens from a distance.Nolan basically invents a new way of telling a story with this film and perfects it beautifully. It's really a story of memory versus imagination and how as we lose our memory we begin to paint our past with imagination and how we want to remember things. So Leonard may or may not fill in the gaps of his memory with what he wants to believe happened or not.Guy Pearce gives an Oscar worthy performance in what should have been an all around award winning movie. From the writing to the editing to the directing to the haunting score, this film is a masterpiece and a true work of art that we just don't get often in film. Nolan combines art house directing with the utmost entertaining and engaging way to tell a story. I wont begin to try to explain the ending or go into true spoilers because this is a film you want to watch without knowing much and then go back and watch it right after. It's truly one of the most brilliant stories ever written and greatest films of all time.+Inventive storytelling by the Nolan's +Objective vs Subjective +Memory vs Imagination +Beginning is the end is the middle +High concept yet highly entertaining 10/10",10,0,3,3 November 2014
Underworld," Yikes
","There's guilty pleasure movies, and then there's the garbage like Underworld that take themselves way too seriously in an attempt to make silly action fun. What could pass as an entertaining and visually dazzling cable watch ends up as a confusing romp of a fantasy adventure.I'm a fan of Kate Beckinsale. I think when she's used right, she's of immense value to any film she's a part of. Take Love & Friendship from earlier this year for example; she was given a solid script and the room to use her British wit & charm in a rewarding performance. Sure she's gorgeous to look at in Underworld, but I can't help but think that the writing didn't allow her to truly show her chops. With that said, her ability is clearly superior to the awful supporting cast. Some of the supporting performances (Shane Brolly) are disappointingly off-putting.Much like a ton of early 2000's action films, Underworld suffers from trying to emulate The Matrix too much. It's always raining, the action scenes are darkly lit, and the characters are in a constant slow motion gaze during the shootouts and fights. I can't necessarily blame Underworld for having bad action, it was simply a product of its time. In fact, there are some good looking stunts here, most of them in camera as well. That's when Underworld is at its most appealing.When Underworld takes itself too seriously and the story is bogged down by exposition scenes (that actually make the film more confusing) it's no fun. The reason I went back and began the franchise this many years later is because I was hoping to have a fun franchise to go to the theaters for in a few weeks with Blood Wars being released. Whether I stick with the franchise or not, I'm not sure. But I know one thing for sure, Underworld's first film is painful to watch.+Beckinsale is watchable+Some nice stunt sequences-Really bad script/dialogue-Supporting performances-Ultimately generic4.8/10",4,0,6,28 December 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Rebellions Are Built on Hope
","Is it as good as The Force Awakens or really, any of the original trilogy? No, but it doesn't need to be. Rogue One benefits from its originality, even if it does tie directly into A New Hope.There's a lot of good and plenty of not so good with Rogue One, but luckily the Star Wars universe is alive and well. And I think there's no question that the non-saga movies are here to stay. I think that's the biggest positive coming out of this film that Lucasfilm/Disney would like to hear; we fans want to see more of these movies. As great as it is to follow the Skywalkers, it's always nice to expand the galaxy with new stories.This story, told in the opening crawl from A New Hope, is about a team of rag-tag rebels who band together to steal the plans to the infamous Death Star. The team consists of Jyn Erso, Cassian, Chirrut, Baze, Bodhi, and a droid, K-2SO. The majority of the cast does a nice job, particularly Felicity Jones (Erso), adding another strong female lead to Star Wars lore. The entire first act is structured around setting up the team and giving each character their own depth and reasoning for joining the rebellion. Therein lies one of the main issues with the film, its pacing. It doesn't have the rapid pace of TFA, the plot takes its time, and there are points where that pacing starts to drag. Drag feels like a dirty word when it comes to filmmaking, but I think if the film was cut down 10 minutes or so, the film would have been more even. With that said, we know from reports that the film was restructured a bit after re-shoots and rewrites tweaked the tone. I won't say that its blatantly obvious, but there are certainly a few points in the film that don't seem to work alongside the rest of the story. For example, Forest Whitaker's character, Saw Gerrera? Completely wasted. In fact, his character was distracting and totally unnecessary to the overall plot.Enough complaining though, let's get into the good stuff. Whether the reworked material was Gareth Edwards doing or not, I think he did a phenomenal job directing this film. You can tell he's a big Star Wars nerd by identifying all of the little cameos and nods to the original films (most of them really work). And the space battles? Wow. Some of the most impressive cinematography and direction I have seen in any sci-fi/fantasy film. The third act is truly remarkable. He makes some bold decisions, narratively. Really, really bold.As with most Star Wars films, the droids tend to be the scene stealers, and the same can be said for K-2SO. The script itself has some questionably written dialogue, but I have no gripes with anything that came from Alan Tudyk's lovable droid. I also thought Ben Mendelsohn was great as Krennic, the Lieutenant Commander of the Empire. He gets a moment with Vader that is classic Star Wars at its best. He's also not overly cartoonish. He has his motives and his arc fits those motives. Something that was a bit cartoonish, however, is the CGI re- creation of Grand Moff Tarkin. It's not that the CGI was bad, but the amount that he was in it, and the fact that he had scenes next to real people, got more and more distracting as the film went on. However, I don't think the same can be said for the brief Leia re-creation towards the end.Overall, Rogue One is pretty awesome. The third act is relentlessly thrilling, with satisfying scene after satisfying scene. But there are plenty of messy aspects to the film as well. With every great thing, there is a little bad. Of course I love seeing Darth Vader rip through dozens of rebels, but do I think that fit tonally with the rest of the film? Absolutely not. There's a lot to love, but I can't dismiss the film for having no flaws. But without question, it is worth seeing.+Great team for the most part+Bold direction+Updated space battles, cinematography-CGI re-creation of Tarkin & Whitaker were distracting-Some things were tonally off7.8/10",7,1,9,15 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Just Get Me to Endgame
","Controversial or not, I did not like this movie. That's not to say I hated this movie, I just felt an extreme amount of apathy, which to my understanding is a filmmakers worst fear. When you make a movie, you want a reaction out of the audience, whether that be good or bad. I just can't see myself ever revisiting this confusing, convoluted, and bland sci-fi film. I actually like Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck a lot too. I haven't seen 'Sugar' yet, but I like 'It's Kind of a Funny Story' and love 'Mississippi Grind'. All that aside, I don't believe this film is directed or written well at all. Dialogue comes off as disingenuous, out of place, and unearned. The humor hits a few times but nowhere near the level you come to expect with Marvel films. And the performances are just okay...? As much as I love Brie Larson, and I think she's one of the greatest actresses of this new generation, she may not have been the best fit. I won't say miscast, I'll save that for after Endgame in April, but something just didn't sit right with her portrayal. The movie also attempts to connect to other Marvel films in a less than gratifying way. The fact that Nick Fury, who is supposed to be extremely bada**, gets his eye cut out by a small scratch from a flipping cat? Are you serious? And Fury gets the Avengers name from an old picture of Carol Danvers? Please. That's some Han Solo getting his name in Solo/Lex Luthor in BVS naming the JL level of stupidity. But putting aside those few major gripes, there's not a lot to hate or love about this one. Chalk it up to a huge swing and a miss for Marvel. Ironically, they have now released their two worst films back to back, with this and Ant-Man & the Wasp.5.0/10",5,122,242,13 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Overcrowded, But Doesn't Deserve All the Hate
","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty wrong with Iron Man 2. But after re-watching for about the 3rd or 4th time, I couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film. It's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. It's action packed, filled with timely humor, and great character development, even if it does have a pretty weak villain.In the next line of villains with the same abilities as the hero, Mickey Rourke stars as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, a man with his mind set on vengeance for what the Starks did to his family. It's hard to ever get truly invested in Vanko as a character. Marvel really struggles with its villains, and Whiplash is another example of that. However, it may be more of a case in which Rourke simply didn't care about giving the character any depth at all.It's even more frustrating because Sam Rockwell is so good as Justin Hammer. He fit the witty humor of the Iron Man films impeccably, and doesn't take himself too seriously. If only the focus would have been on Hammer instead of Rourke.The Pepper and Tony relationship is better than ever in Iron Man 2 as Pepper is introduced as the new CEO of Stark Industries with Tony sidelined with other issues. I've said it before but I'll say it again, Pepper and Tony are one of the only superhero relationships that actually work, and it's once again handled extremely well in this sequel.Rhodey is back as the reluctant best friend to Tony, though this time, Don Cheadle suits up as War Machine. I didn't mind Terrence Howard's portrayal, but I think at this point, I couldn't see anyone fitting more nicely alongside Downey Jr. Their pairing make for some of the best action of the film.One of the film's few problems lies with the inclusion of so many different story lines, and a few shoehorned in characters. Scarlett Johansson makes a grand first impression as Black Widow, but she didn't really need to be there. However, her scenes alongside Jon Favreau are very memorable.Sure, there are quite a few unnecessary elements of the film's plot, but Iron Man 2 is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film. I can watch Downey Jr as Tony Stark any day.+Action+Cheadle is an upgrade+Rockwell+Pepper and Tony-Overcrowded plot-Whiplash is a throw away villain7.8/10",7,0,3,28 April 2016
Alien: Resurrection," The Basketball Scene...Enough Said...
","Alien 3 is a mess, but it's nothing compared to the abomination that is Alien: Resurrection. One wouldn't be wrong by saying that there isn't one good thing to say about this film. Sure, everything isn't horrible, but just about 95 percent of it is. Last time I checked, that's not a good percentage.Resurrection is a shell of the films that made this series great in the first place. To start, the film's tone is all over the place. It feels like the script wants the film to take a lighter direction but the direction does exactly the opposite. You have characters that don't feel like real human beings and always seem to overact to the conflict, why the conflict itself is overtly gory and grotesque, just for the sake of being gory and grotesque. I'm still not sure what audience this film was trying to appeal to. It's neither a scary thriller like the first film nor an exciting action film like Aliens. But that's not for lack of trying.Who thought it would be a good idea to have Ripley come back as an uncomfortably sexualized version of herself without any explanation as to why she was cloned in the first place? After the semi-heroic act at the end of Alien 3, there's absolutely no need to go back and recycle the same characters. And really, what was the point of bringing back Ripley if she wasn't even going to have the qualities we love about Weaver's portrayal. This does way more to hurt Ripley's legacy than it does to amplify it.Written by Joss Whedon and directed by the guy who made Amelie makes this film more puzzling than its predecessor. We know there were severe behind the scenes issues with Fincher's Alien 3, but who could have possibly greenlit Resurrection? There's nothing redeemable about this film. And I mean nothing. Great actors and actresses like Ron Perlman and Winona Ryder give less than stellar performances (and that's generous). Even Weaver, who has always been the light of this franchise was just passable as Ripley. Heck, the Xenomorphs themselves were pathetic. The special effects looked off, they were kept up in cages for most of the film, and the hybrid alien at the end? My god it was all-time awful.-Tone is all over the place-Script and direction take the film to separate places-Performances2.9/10",2,2,3,19 May 2017
Passengers," Promising, but an Underwhelming and Uninspired Result
","The premise of Passengers is fascinating, and it stars two of the hottest names in Hollywood, but the end result falls short of anything remotely close to what I hoped this would be when it was announced a few years ago.Directed by Morten Tyldum, director of the acclaimed The Imitation Game, Passengers is about two people who mysteriously wake up 90 years early, aboard a ship headed to a new planet. Marketed as a sci-fi with a romantic angle, but it's really more of the opposite. There's a lot of good in Passengers, mostly dealing with the lead's chemistry, but the lack of focus and identity is where it fails the hardest. That, and the fact that the script feels like something thrown together at the last minute.I feel like once Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence signed on, the filmmakers fast-tracked the production to take advantage of the two's widespread appeal. It's unfortunate, because there's a good film in here somewhere. The idea of living alone vs forcing someone else to live the rest of an isolated life with you is explored, but only sparingly. The sci-fi elements are surface level, and anything that needed an explanation was brushed off in some casual & paint-by-numbers way. I would have preferred one or the other. Either go cerebral like Interstellar or stay within the silliness of a sci-fi like Edge of Tomorrow.Luckily, Pratt & Lawrence are great together. So much so that you forget they are spitting out painfully melodramatic dialogue. If they weren't the actors they were, this could pass as a TV movie with the script. I'm not surprised, considering Jon Spaiht's also wrote Doctor Strange this year, a film I wasn't too keen on.One of the major appeals to the film was the mystery surrounding the two waking up. Because of that, I was always engaged and intrigued as to the film's direction. With that said, I can't say it's a film I would ever be inclined to watch again. A great premise was really just turned into a mediocre romantic sci-fi. Everything was surface level and nothing really felt inspired. It's a disappointment overall, adding to the extremely long list of underwhelming blockbusters this year.

Zootopia," Change Starts With Us
","2016 has been a so-so year in film thus far. Sure, it's only the beginning of March, but there hasn't really been that knock out film to this point. I enjoyed The Finest Hours and Eddie the Eagle for what they were, but besides perhaps Deadpool, no movie has really been worth seeing more than once. Zootopia absolutely is that film for me. It's the next installment in Disney Animation Studio's resurgence of greatness and it can be enjoyed by everyone. It may be Disney's most colorful film to date, for a few reasons, but it also has the classic Disney moral message for viewers of all ages and backgrounds.Zootopia takes place in a world where there are no humans and animals do everything as if they are humans. They have houses, police forces, and access to our type of transportation. Basically, this is the one film in Disney's canon where fans can't really make the theories that it takes place within the same universe as all of the other films. With that said, I loved the world building that Zootopia was able to establish. In many ways, this is the film I can see Disney making sequels to for several years to come. The characters are well realized and there are plenty of potential directions they can take the story.Right from the opening scene I found myself attached the adorable, Judy Hopps, a bunny who dreams of becoming the first of her species to become a cop. Zootopia takes on many of the unfortunate tropes of our real world but the one most identifiable is discrimination and segregation. So of course Hopps is naturally not taken seriously as a determined officer of the law. The self-referential nature of the film doesn't stop there but I don't think it ever jumps the shark. As noticeable as some of the discrimination and prejudices can be when pointed out by several characters, it ends of serving as a good message to not judge or underestimate people's determinations and dreams.On the lighter side, Zootopia is one of the cleverest Disney films to come out in recent memory. Its constant nods to pop culture including famous films like The Godfather or TV shows like Breaking Bad give the parents more than enough reason to take their kids to the theater. There are plenty of jokes that will fly over kids heads and the humor never gets too silly. It's a great balance that makes an animated kids films so great, and Zootopia is a good example of that.More than anything, it's worth seeing for its fun characters and inspiring message. The voice talent is as good as it has been for Disney in a long time as Jason Bateman, Ginnifer Goodwin, Idris Elba, Jenny Slate, and J.K. Simmons all do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. You will get attached to Hopps and her unlikely fox friend, Nick Wilde as they go on a journey to uncover a conspiracy that is plaguing Zootopia. Which brings up another brilliant aspect of this film which is its meticulous plot. Near the end some moments felt contrived and perhaps too far-fetched, but when you have enjoyed a film to the extent to which I had enjoyed Zootopia to that point, it didn't really bother me.When an animated Disney film manages to bring to life several new and exciting characters while also implanting an intricate crime story in between, you know you have a gem on your hands. Zootopia may not be as memorable as some of the greatest Pixar films (hey what films are?) but it does have its fair share of thought provoking moments and endlessly re-watchable funny gags. A clever script and a thought provoking message makes Zootopia the best 2016 film to date thus far.+Voice cast+Well-realized world+Something for everyone+Likeable characters you can't help but root for+Pop culture references+Thought provoking message-Some moments felt contrived towards the end9.4/10",9,6,16,5 March 2016
Shaun of the Dead," Horror-Comedy Bliss
","Sometimes a director's style can overtake the story so much that the film suffers for it, and that was the case with the more recent The World's End, in my opinion. But Shaun of the Dead is just too dang fun and filled with cliché bending humor that Wright's style proves to be the best thing about this Horror-Comedy.The first of the Cornetto or 'Three Flavor's' trilogy focuses on a world in the midst of a zombie outbreak, and two loser friends who don't really do anything with their lives. Buddies Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play the duo, and brilliantly so. I much preferred their bro-mance to the romance between Pegg and Kate Ashfield, who plays his girlfriend Liz. The enjoyment here is clearly with the fact that if a zombie outbreak ever did happen, I would act exactly how these characters did. I don't watch the news and rarely care to people watch when running to the store, so I wouldn't be surprised if I didn't realize there was a Zombie-apocalypse going on either. Or even the gag where Pegg struggles to shoot a shotgun. These are all real-life scenarios put into a horror film, and thus the comedy works better than expected.It doesn't feature an Oscar winning script or world class actors, but it is loads of fun with a kicka** soundtrack paired with amazingly timed physical gags. Shaun of the Dead was and always will be a refreshing take on the Zombie sub-genre of horror.+Soundtrack+The laughs hit+Relatable lead characters7.9/10",7,1,3,19 September 2016
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Doubles Down on Spectacle
","Sometimes it's really hard to see past a film's flaws. For whatever reason though, I really get a kick out of these Pirates adventures. Whether it be because I had fond memories of them when I was much younger, or because there just wasn't quite a spectacle like them in the mid-2000's, either way I still find Dead Man's Chest to be an admirable part of the franchise.I'm not sure there will ever be a Pirates film as good as the first one. There's nothing quite like that first adventure with Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. And Dead Man's Chest wastes no time trying to top the spectacle and scope of that film. However, when the story and characters are second fiddle to the set pieces and grand action sequences, that's where you have the problem. In many ways, this film only exists to set up the third film. Most of the story beats are drawn out in what could be only one film's worth of story, but we don't get the payoff for any of it until the 3rd adventure. That's not necessarily always a bad thing, but I would have preferred each film to stand on its own a little bit more.Although we don't get Geoffrey Rush's maniacal Captain Barbossa, we are treated with equally invested performances from Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard as Boostrap Bill. Jones', the main antagonist, is essentially a supernatural pirate with the ability to also control a large sea creature called, the Kraken. If you thought the original film takes advantage of the over-the-top side to the series, the second one doubles down. Luckily, Nighy is an absolute joy to watch on screen, thanks in large part due to the groundbreaking special effects of Jones & various other characters and creatures.Much like the first film, Dead Man's Chest is a bit overlong and has too many moving parts. It worked with the first film because the script, directing, and performances were all brilliant. I think some of the magic wore off here because you definitely feel the length. But there's no denying the entertainment value if you enjoyed the first outing. The ridiculousness continues to an island of indigenous people wanting Jack Sparrow and subsequently a dog to be their ruler, a wheel barrow sword fight that goes on for like 15 minutes, and one great cliffhanger. I know they're silly, but I always manage to have a blast re-watching them.+Doubles down on ridiculous action+Mind-blowing special effects+Cliffhanger-Lengthy & too goofy at times7.6/10",7,1,1,25 May 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," An Unforgettable First Adventure
","What has now become a multi-billion-dollar franchise once started as an ambitious risk by Disney. Make a feature length film based on a ride at your theme park? That just didn't seem like something logical to do at the time. However, with a talented group of actors, a swashbuckling script, and one hell of a musical score, the first Pirates of the Caribbean is an absolute joy on all fronts. Perhaps, never really being topped in any way by its successors.Starting a new franchise is bold these days, which is why Disney made the right move in hiring Johnny Depp as the charming and sometimes irreverent Captain Jack Sparrow. An even better move was not leaving the entire film up to Sparrow to lead. Complementing the zaniness of Sparrow is the elegant but fierce Elizabeth Swan and the mysterious and brave Will Turner (played by Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom respectively). All of them are great, but may not prove to be as fun if not for the incredible visual effects, makeup, and action. This felt like the first major blockbuster of the 21st century, and the rest of the series certainly ranks up there.One of the best things this series, and particularly the first film, did so well is create a mythology and universe surrounding Pirates in and around the Caribbean. It happens gradually in 'Black Pearl', seemingly allowing viewers to adapt to the unknown shores of the series without feeling overwhelmed. A lot of it's fun swordplay and grim family history, but the supernatural elements play just as well. Immortally cursed pirates just begin to mark the lovable weirdness of this film.Almost as well known as the characters and the film itself is the score by Klaus Badelt and Hans Zimmer. Zimmer is always remembered as the one who created the iconic theme, but Badelt should also be credited, as should a few other unknown composers at the time who chipped in. But really, the movies would not be the same without the perfect music played over the action and adventures. This film is lengthy and does feature an annoyingly pesky English Navy who won't go away, but Geoffrey Rush's turn as Captain Barbosa and an equally (if not more) memorable turn from Depp as Sparrow makes the first film the best in the series. As fun as the action and over-the- top humor and adventure are, the thing you can always come back to in these films are the characters. The movies never quite captured the same entertainment as 'Black Pearl' did, but that wasn't for lack of trying.+Action & adventure are unmatched+Score+Memorable characters+Set up the mythology well-Lengthy8.8/10",8,0,1,22 May 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Evil Awakens
","Though it feels much more like a Star Wars film than anything Star Trek has ever done, 'Into Darkness' succeeds in most of the areas in sets out to, even if it wasn't the general direction most Trekkies wanted the series to go after a brilliant reboot in 2009.Most of the scrutiny from the film comes from its handling of the character, Spock, and the unnecessary hiding of him for the entire marketing campaign. While the ladder is a fair criticism, it doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the film. Though I can understand a particular third act plot choice that felt like a forced homage to 1982's The Wrath of Khan, this rendition of Khan is still well realized. Most of the credit there should go to the relentless performance from Benedict Cumberbatch. Not as flashy nor as memorable as Ricardo Montalban's Khan, Cumberbatch is far more brutal and deceptive. Even on repeat viewing, I found myself captivated by every scene with Khan, especially those which also involved Kirk and/or Spock. There's something about the dialogue between them that feels vintage good vs evil while also presenting such a tremendous amount of gravitas as well.J.J. Abrams is a genius filmmaker, but I don't think he gets enough credit for what he did with both his Trek films. The series was nearly dead before he came aboard and revamped and refreshed the entire idea of what a Trek film is. Even if it deviates from lore, 'Into Darkness' is a really well made film. The effects have never been better and the way Abrams seamlessly takes us from a CGI or green screen landscape into an integral one on one dialogue battle is very impressive.Though not every key emotional moment feels earned in the third act, it's nice seeing all of the actors start to come into their own as the respected crew members of the Enterprise. Scotty has never been better, Sulu gets more than enough time to shine, Quinto brought a new layer to Spock not seen in 2009, and Chris Pine feels much more like an heir apparent to William Shatner than he did in the first entry. To me, it was much easier to care about the characters this time around.With all this said, there's plenty that I wish the film did differently. The Khan reveal and 3rd act mishandle of the infamous moment are just some of the mishaps that could have been fixed. Or even the entire subplot with the Admirals daughter, but I digress. 'Into Darkness' is a far better film than it probably has a right to be with a fun and exciting direction from Abrams and lively performances from the good and bad side of the coin.+Cumberbatch+Abrams directing style+Great dialogue between Kirk, Khan, and Spock-3rd act mishaps8.2/10",8,2,6,21 July 2016
12 Angry Men," Masterful Filmmaking
","Being a film buff myself, I'd like to think I know good movies when I see them. With 12 Angry Men, all it took was a few scenes and I knew this was one of the great ones. Not only was this movie important and influential, it's also easily re-watchable. I've seen it three times now and each time I pick up on new tidbits of information and dialogue that I missed the time before. I would imagine it's not easy directing an ensemble of 12 in one small room, but Sidney Lumet managed to do it, and do it very well.I often find crime-drama's to be my favorite genre of movies in large part because of the suspenseful aspects of that particular storytelling. While 12 Angry Men is far from a prototypical crime drama, it's certainly suspenseful. What begins as one man's doubts against 11 other men's desire to leave the courthouse as fast as possible, ends with a powerful message of prejudices and class issues. The nice thing about this particular criminal case is that at first listen, it's hard to argue with what some of the men are saying. There's definitely a grey area to this particular case, and that proves to help the development of the suspense and third-act revelations.Perhaps even more important than the simple theme of class issues is the idea of communication, and how far a little talking can take you. As Henry Fonda nicely put it 'we have a reasonable doubt, and that's something that's very valuable in our system. No jury can declare a man guilty unless it's sure.' All of these men were under difficult conditions, considering the small room and blistering heat, but all of them also needed to understand that communicating with each other was the only way they were going to get through the night. I loved the way Lumet gracefully gave every one of the actor's their time to shine. Although Fonda was the clear star, and likely had the most lines, here, every single one of them brought their A-game.The film also points out how easy it is to involve your own personal prejudices into cases like this. Perhaps even to some viewers it may be hard to against the grain of 11 other 'angry men' and vote not guilty, but sometimes it takes more than just sitting around and waiting for someone else to step up. Sometimes you have to be the one to point out the questionable things in whatever job field or discussion you are in. Communication can be a difficult thing, but if you're willing to listen to others share their opinion, you should be willing to talk as well. But I do know one thing that can't be disputed, the greatness that is Sidney Lumet's 12 Angry Men.93/100",9,0,1,5 September 2016
Green Room," Jeremy Saulnier Does it Again
","Green Room is full of visceral thrills, gritty violence, and real characters forced into situations where they have to do despicable things. And to be quite honest, that's absolutely terrifying to watch for 90 minutes.Jeremy Saulnier is back directing after his brilliant, Blue Ruin, which unfortunately no one saw. His job on Green Room is just as impressive, if not more. While the former is a much more personal story about one man on a revenge mission, Green Room covers a band who is accidentally thrust into a life or death situation at a skinhead bar after they come across a horrible crime. Both are extremely disturbing takes on violence, I found Green Room to have a few more thrills and ideas being explored.Joining Saulnier is the late-great Anton Yelchin, Joe Cole (from Peaky Blinders fame), Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat, Callum Turner, and Patrick Stewart. Stewart is as terrifying as I've ever seen him as he plays the diabolical bar owner who takes matters into his own hands. It's difficult to watch Charles Xavier do the things he does to innocent band members, but with Saulnier's direction, it works.But I think the band's innocence may be what I found to be most compelling about this story. They aren't a clean cut or crime free group of young-adults, they have their own shortcomings as well. Of course, they aren't as horrible as the skinheads who spend time at the neo-nazi level of bad, but they aren't completely innocent either. Saulnier paints them as inexperienced and terrified which gives the action scenes more weight.It's not for everyone as the violence is more brutal than something you would find in a Scorsese film, but it's one of the most impressive thrillers of 2016 with creativity and grittiness that is up there with the best of them.+Performances are grounded with realism+Saulnier's relentless direction+Shocking9.0/10",9,23,47,16 August 2016
Us," Our Own Worst Enemy
","I truly love that someone like Jordan Peele is out there making original films like this. Get Out was a near perfect horror/satire and Us, with all of its flaws and possibly plot holes, is an inventive, chilling, and creepy entry into what has become a real resurgence of the horror genre these past few years. Like any great film, I still have tons of questions following my screening, many of which are spoiler territory. The film's insistence on staying ambiguous was great until it decided to reveal some answers that we didn't necessarily need. But I'm afraid, those only made my questions exponentiate. Lupita Nyong'o is expectedly incredible as the mother of the family being tormented by their own doppelgangers, and Winston Duke follows up his beloved turn in Black Panther with very good balanced performance here. With a movie like this, seeing it with a packed audience on a Friday night sometime can make the film less scary, but it certainly makes it more fun. Though the film is never truly terrifying, it's always unsettling, and those unsettling thoughts will not leave your brain until long after you've seen it in theaters. Peele's direction far outshines his writing this time around, with his music and shot choices making for some of the most memorable in recent years with horror. The only thing bringing this movie down is the amount of suspension of disbelief you have to obtain to buy into what Peele is selling. It's a double edged sword when you start to read into Reddit theories that could either make or break your opinion on this mind-trip of a thriller.8.7/10",8,9,20,23 March 2019
The Danish Girl," Another Oscar Bait Film That Falls Short
","2015 has been a relatively letdown of a year for film. Sure, you have the obvious masterpieces and returns to form for several huge franchises, but I feel like most of the films we expected to be Oscar contenders fell short of where our expectations hoped they would reach. That is yet again the case with The Danish Girl. Coming from the director of Les Miserables a few years back, The Danish Girl is loosely based on the life of one of the first people to have a sex transformation in early 20th century Denmark.Eddie Redmayne plays Einar/Lili, who begins to feel comfortable in woman's clothing after his wife, Gerda, played by Alicia Vikander, asked him to pose for one of her paintings. Both Redmayne and Vikander give great performances, with the latter probably outshining the raining Oscar winner himself, but the film around them is just okay. With those great performances, you would think you feel very connected to their characters, but I never did. Their chemistry feels real and the conflicts that arise are most definitely real, but the solutions that the script calls for all feel unimaginative and uninspired.Sometimes you can feel Tom Hooper's direction and Lucinda Coxon's script attempt to outshine the performances too much. By that I mean, the dialogue and structure ends up feeling too cute or too clever for a subject matter that could and should be tackled in a far more meaningful manner. If anything, I'm sure this film will do good for the movement and awareness of trans-gender in general. One of the most jarring things that's only touched upon in The Danish Girl is the lack of understanding at all for trans-genders, who were outed as insane during this time, and that was under 100 years ago.The Danish Girl had promise but it only delivered on a few fronts, that being the extraordinary performance from Vikander and also Redmayne, while also creating a beautifully shot landscape of 20th century Europe. But the film itself had no regard for subtly in the big moments and profoundness in its quiet moments.+Vikander is Oscar worthy+Redmayne once again proves he deserves the hype+Looks gorgeous-Unimaginative writing-Style over substance5.7/10",5,2,4,6 January 2016
Knives Out," Donuts
","After getting unnecessary fan-hate after directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson returned to the big screen to direct a murder mystery like no other. And I feel like I'm comfortable saying this is close to a crime thriller masterpiece. Filled with earned twists and turns, incredible character depth, meticulous direction, and a wonderful time at the movies for all ages. And if I'm not mistaken, this was Ana de Armas' first true starring role, and she absolutely nailed it. She is a star in the making. If you're able to standout in a cast with Captain America, Laurie Strode, General Zod, and James Bond, throw in legends like Don Johnson & Christopher Plummer, with Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, and Jaeden Martell, you know you have serious talent. That's how good de Armas is. I can't wait to rewatch this one.9.5/10",9,3,10,3 December 2019
Oldboy," Laugh and the World Laughs With You. Weep and You Weep Alone.
","One of the most visually impressive films of the 2000's with meticulously craft directing from Chan-Woo Park. But also easily one of the most devastating films you'll see. It rips your heart out in more ways than one.A revenge tale is only as good as the characters are written, and this film is brilliantly adapted from the 90's comic. The characters, who were apparently not developed enough in the comic, are well established within the first 20 minutes. All characters are brought around nicely by the time the credits roll, which contributes to the devastation of the film's emotional gut punch towards the end.One of the main reasons the characters work so nicely, is that Park provides character development in more ways than one. Whether it be through an important close up on our lead character's face or even a well-timed artistic metaphor, the story is so well-realized through its characters. Being that it's a tragic story that turns into a revenge flick but then turns back into a tragic tale again, you need to believe both sides of the coin. Min-sik Choi and Ji-tae Yu do a tremendous job at rounding out motivations as Dae-su and Woo-jin respectively.In order to feel the full impact of emotion Park was going for, you have to be with the film every step of the way. Although there are some plot points that blur the lines of being plot holes, Park gives us at least an acceptable answer to keep us engaged. Even just looking at the thrilling action sequences, which can be over-the-top and 'Raid'- like at times, is acceptable after seeing the finished product.Oldboy is a modern day classic. Not necessarily the type of film I would want to revisit more than once, but I got the full emotional impact that I had hoped for. Chan-Woo Park majestically directs the comic to life better than anyone possibly could.+Impressive fight scenes+Devastatingly beautiful storytelling+Lead performances-Potential holes in the story9.1/10",9,1,2,31 August 2016
Spider-Man 2," A Superhero Film About Something More
","Similarly as dated as the first Spider-Man film is, Spider-Man 2 isn't the easiest re-watch. Raimi's direction is tight but it's also not as sharp as you may remember it. But this film stood for something more, which is quite often the fault of most MCU movies in this era. Thrilling, surprising, and poignant, Spider-Man 2 showed that you don't always have to play it safe with our favorite web-slinger, there's so much more underneath the skin to address.What I really love about this film is how well it balances out screen time. We get introduced to a few new characters this time around, and of course none more prevalent than Doc Ock, played by Alfred Molina. Known now as one of the greatest superhero villains of all time, Molina stands out because of the way he's written as well as his charismatically tragic performance. It's really just your typical scientist gone mad idea, but juxtaposed with Peter's struggling personal life, it plays extremely well. Which brings me to why this film and really Spider-Man in general have an impact on audiences so heavily, his problems. Spider-Man is no longer getting bullied in high school, but that didn't remiss him from dealing with deep personal problems as a growing man. As frustrating as it is to see him try and navigate Mary Jane's mind without telling her how he really feels, it's an issue that Peter has always had. The very idea of holding in your true feelings to 'save the ones closest to you' feels like it comes straight out of decades of Spider-Man lore. Even if it feels sour in today's world, it surely wasn't back in 2004. Peter also has to come to terms with the guilt he still holds over his uncle's death, and that his best friend wants to kill him. All of that while trying to balance a real job with The Daily Bugle and his life as Spider-Man is a lot to keep up with.It's those real-life problems and issues that will always be appealing to fans, and it's no different here. However, as I said, there are still a lot that's dated about this film that even the insanely good action can't overcome. I mentioned it in my review for the first film, but seeing every woman in the film either scream their head off for men throughout every action scene, or in complete awe of what a particular man can do in every action scene isn't as forgivable as you may think. Surely there's other things women can do right? It's also not the easiest to watch James Franco complain and whine about Spider- Man in just about every scene. Besides that, Spider-Man 2 is a brilliantly poignant superhero-action film. At the end of the day, there aren't too many superhero films that can say that.+About something more+Balances everything well+Train sequence-Females written poorly-Harry Osborn8.2/10",8,0,5,11 July 2017
The Irishman," Painting Houses
","After years of hearing about Martin Scorsese returning to the gangster/mob sub genre, using groundbreaking CGI/de-aging technology, re-teaming with De Niro & Pesci, and collaborating with Pacino for the first time, The Irishman ends up being a little bit disappointing. To me, it's not the best picture material we all thought it might be, but it's certainly worth watching. Some fantastic reflective (and impressively not showy) acting and directing from the film's main attractions, though I will say I didn't think the de-aging was effective at all. You can't de-age movement, nor can you really make De Niro look and feel 50 years younger than he is in real life, which is what they tried to do for the first section of the film. Ultimately, it's not a film I would ever re-watch or root for to win an Oscar, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch it at the very least.8.2/10",8,2,7,16 December 2019
Black Book," 'I never thought I would dread Liberation Day'
","There's been many World War II films and a good chunk of them involve the Holocaust in some way, shape, or form, but Black Book feels very much like its own original thing. Starring Melisandre herself, Carice van Houten, as Ellis de Vries, a Jewish singer who navigates herself through the hands of the Nazi's while doing her best to assist the Dutch Resistance. Though it's inspired by true events, the amount of twists, turns, and betrayals feel like something out of a spy film. Which, I guess, in a way very much fits the aesthetic and approach they take to this World War II film. There's a great sense of journey for van Houten's character, though I do feel like a further attention to geographic detail would have been nice. In all, this is a harrowing film that shows a side to World War II that I'm not sure we've seen before.7.5/10",7,0,0,28 March 2019
Creed," Legacy
","I heard Creed was good. I had no idea it was THIS good. Coming off of the brilliant Fruitvale Station, Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan are back collaborating for the Rocky spin off, Creed. Knowing how well made of a film Fruitvale Station is, I figured Coogler was the right guy to helm the film but for some reason I was still skeptical about the project in general. The story itself is fascinating but I didn't know if it would be handled with the care needed to produce a quality installment in this legendary franchise. Not only is this a great boxing film, it's one of the best all around films of the year. Everything you love from the original films is here in at least some capacity and the nostalgia is at an all time high. I haven't seen all of the Rocky films but I love the characters and aesthetic of the series enough for Creed to emotionally resonate with me multiple times throughout the film. A lot of people are going to complain that it's too similar to the first Rocky, and while that may be a valid criticism, I think you can make the case that great films always take from the best. Creed has the best aspects from the original films and takes an original spin on it.Most notably being that our lead character, Adonis Johnson (son of Apollo Creed) isn't like Rocky Balboa at all. He has the passion and fire but his background is completely different. He's from Hollywood and due to his father being a heavyweight champion, he's well off as well. I really like this twist on the boxing film. As much as I really liked Southpaw from earlier this year, Creed really hits on all levels. The acting is getting a lot of credit and rightfully so. I don't know that Sylvester Stallone has ever been better. Michael B. Jordan, who may have been snubbed for an Oscar a few years back, is just as good. I think because of how good Stallone is in a supporting role, you don't realize how perfect Jordan is in this role.The directing from Ryan Coogler and cinematography from Maryse Alberti is marvelous. The camera work and shot selection alone is worth seeing on the big screen, and then probably seen again. All the fight scenes are good, but the first big fight Creed has is quite simply one of the most well choreographed scenes of 2015. It is all done in one continuous few minute take. I really couldn't believe how well that was handled.But by far the biggest thing I took away from this film was that it doesn't try to be something it's not. It knows it's a spin off from Rocky and it plays on that in a perfect way. Yet it also doesn't rely on the nostalgia factor alone, though it does have some great callbacks to the old films. It doesn't take unnecessary risks or try to do too much with its plot. It is just one of the best executed films of the year. The entertainment value is just as much if not more than the superhero films this year, and it also has a well written story, directed to perfection, along with a fantastic sound design/mixing/editing, with incredible performances all around.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Sacrifices Character For CGI & Planned Spin-Offs
","Because of all the continuity inconsistencies in the X-Men universe, I had forgotten quite a bit. Particularly, I forgot just how unfortunately mishandled X-Men Origins: Wolverine was. Hugh Jackman is one of the finest actors of our generation, and is quite good in the film, but he got stuck with a mess of a movie. This was another movie that nearly killed the franchise.Before I get to the bad, and there's a lot of bad, let's talk about the good. I love me some Liev Schreiber and he absolutely kills it as Sabretooth. A whole lot better than whatever the heck that version of Sabretooth we got in the first X-Men, anyway. I know it was controversial to make him and Wolverine brothers, but I dug it. Ironically, I don't think he's called anything besides Victor Creed in the film. No matter, Schreiber brings a calm but vicious presence, similar to Jackman's Wolverine, which makes him the perfect antagonist. Oh, how I wish the film kept the focus on them.Logan and Victor went through many wars and battles together, but they weren't always the only ones with special abilities taking on bad guys. Under the command of William Stryker, Logan and Victor fought on Team X (similar to X-Force), with the help of The Blob, Kestrel, Bolt, and none other than Deadpool. However, this only consists of 15 minutes or so of the film, and it only adds to confusing direction of this film. It really feels like the director, Gavin Hood, was forced to include several unnecessary mutants and cameos that were so far removed from the overall plot. A gratuitous fight with The Blob, a completely unnecessary role for Gambit, and a random appearance by Professor X and Scott Summers, really?The film's strengths lie with the performances of Jackman, Schreiber, and a solid turn from Lynn Collins as Kayla Silverfox. Though, that performance from Collins is slightly undercut by a confusing character turn in the third act. The tone is not as much of the problem as I originally remembered. It's really the questionable studio decisions, including a legendarily awful mistake made with Deadpool (which I refuse to even discuss), that flush this film into a deep dark hole of comic-book hell. For some reason the Wolverine character has been a tough one to crack by himself on screen. Hopefully, 'Logan' can change that.+Logan & Victor+There's a good story in there somewhere-So many unnecessary characters & cameos-Bounces around and wanders too much-One of the worst endings of all time4.7/10",4,1,4,1 March 2017
The Mummy," Death is Only the Beginning
","It's always difficult for brainless action movies to hold up over time. It's incredibly rare that such films can stand more than a decade or so without feeling too silly. The Mummy, which was made nearly 2 decades ago, definitely falls under this category. With a dumb script, exaggerated acting, dated CGI, and a dopey tone, 1999's version of The Mummy is a cable movie at best.It's amazing to see how far this series has come, from the intellectual 1932 film to the blockbuster action 2017 feature, it's clear that this is a property that people are interested in no matter the genre it forms. With that said, if a film titled 'The Mummy' never manages to offer a single scare or thrill, there's something seriously wrong with the direction. 'But that's not the direction they wanted to take with the movie', some may say, well then make the film you intended at least a little bit entertaining. I had heard this film wasn't to be taken seriously, but to show no respect or knowledge for the source material at all feels disappointing to say the least.The acting is abysmal. Some of it can certainly be contributed to the dialogue they were given and perhaps the direction as well, but the line delivery here is just brutal. I know Brendan Fraser isn't particularly regarded as Oscar caliber, but Rachel Weisz definitely is. To see all them do such poor work is more than difficult to watch. But I think this can all come back to the tone established by director and writer, Stephen Sommers. The lighter, goofier tone is clearly purposeful, but it only works if you buy into the characters. I always bring up the Fast & Furious as examples for these types of films because they succeed in making over the top action movies without sacrificing the dynamics between their central characters. The Mummy doesn't do that one bit.I think one of the things that does work is Jerry Goldsmith's beautiful score. Not only does it harken back to the days of John Williams' heroic theme for Indiana Jones, but it actually complements the action quite well. It's just too bad I didn't particularly care for the action that was going on anyway. Overall, this film displays a serious lack of awareness in tone, humor, and writing, even if some of the action provides brief swashbuckling fun amidst a great score.

The Others," The World of the Dead Gets Mixed Up With the World of the Living
","There's something to be said for a horror film that takes its time and builds to an impressive climax. The Others is the definition of a slow burn and although it never technically pays off all that it sets up, it's certainly a well made horror-thriller. I typically look for an atmospheric or psychological take on horror stories, and The Others is one that relies more heavily on those two things than it does jump scare or creepy imagery. But there's still a fair share of those as well. Powered by a strong performance by Nicole Kidman, as a protective single mother who attempts to hide her family from the threatening outside world. It doesn't completely all come together by film's end, but most of the questions are answered in a surprising and fascinating way.7.3/10",7,0,0,21 October 2018
Ed Wood," It's All About the Big Picture
","Leave it to Tim Burton to direct a film about the 'wackiest' filmmaker of all time. But in all seriousness, Ed Wood may very well be the best directing job of Burton's career. It's funny, strange, and rapidly paced. Burton deserves credit.I really love when movies take place within the world of filmmaking, especially during the 1950's. It was just an interesting time to be involved in the film business. Perhaps nobody more interesting than Edward D. Wood Jr. Although apparently much of the film's details were made up for the movie itself, it's hard not to get a kick out of Wood's story. A man stumbles himself into Hollywood with little to no experience, and manages to garner decent budgets to make multiple films, that's Hollywood 101.One of Burton's greatest qualities is the ability to develop a great journey for the characters. Ed Wood has a clear beginning, middle, and end, but it's the stuff along the way that makes for the most entertainment. The sheer absurdity of Wood's story is really where Burton tends to bring out his best work. Watching a man without any real talent as a filmmaker plow his way through studio executives and convince actors to join him in his quest makes it all the more amazing. I mean come on, this guy compares himself to Citizen Kane on multiple occasions.As for the performances, there's almost too many good ones to mention. Johnny Depp, in his second Burton feature, begins to show exactly why he's one of this generation's greatest talents. He easily could have been nominated for an Oscar here. It's also the first real time he played such a uniquely strange character, something he's got himself stuck into doing these days. Martin Landau, who did win an Oscar for his turn as Bela Lugosi, is what makes this film work so well. It can get tiresome watching Wood's undeserved success, but Landau works so impeccably well as a drugged up Lugosi. I couldn't have imagined someone better in that role.The rest of the cast and crew also deserve credit, mostly for succeeding in making such a strangely delicious film. After a while, you begin to go along with the joke of Wood's career. And to look up and see that there's still plenty that isn't falsified makes it all the better.+Unique characters and story+Movie about movies+Burton's tight directing8.0/10",8,1,1,8 September 2016
Spotlight," Ignorance
","Tackling subject matter like Spotlight does is very difficult to portray on film. You have to accurately tell the story enough to not create outcry while also not relying on the weight of the source material in order to induce emotion. It's difficult, but certainly not impossible and Spotlight did pretty much everything right. The acting from one of the best ensemble casts of the year is phenomenal. Everyone gave such a great performance that no one ended up stealing the spotlight, pun intended. The directing is top notch as Tom McCarthy perfectly weaves between scenes without any wasted screen time.Spotlight is based on the 'Spotlight investigative team at the Boston Globe and their uncovering of the Massachusetts Catholic sex abuse scandal. I think what I was most impressed with was that it by no means was a catholic hate fest, and it definitely could have been. In fact, several moments throughout the film it is shown that even the Spotlight team made many mistakes during the course of this piece. I really appreciated the way everyone was portrayed.The performances are all incredible. I'm sure the film will garner many awards come a few months, but it was the chemistry between the entire group that was most impressive. There isn't really a lead, the whole team should be honored. But if I had to pick, I think Mark Ruffalo deserves the most recognition, in large part due to the writing, but it's his subtly emotional sequences that are most effective.When you think of investigative journalism films, All the President's Men certainly comes to mind for most people, rightfully so. But I think Spotlight may this generation's version of that. There are plenty of moments in which it's obvious is inspired from that film, and they both do a great job at making a film without any action, very interesting. I'd be shocked if this doesn't get nominated for a ton of Oscars and possibly even win best picture. Spotlight is extraordinary.+Ruffalo+Ensemble cast+Tight script+Meticulous directing10/10",10,5,9,21 November 2015
Insomnia," Nolan's Most Underrated
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.It seems weird calling Insomnia Christopher Nolan's most underrated movie considering I also think it's his worst film. But saying it's his worst is saying a lot. Insomnia is a brilliant psychological crime thriller that has a lot of the same beats as other police dramas but it definitely has the Nolan flavor along with it. It's about a detective Will Dormer, played by Al Pacino, who is forced to take up a case in Alaska with his partner in order to save his job because of previous mishaps on a case. The case is one of Kay Connel, a fan of Walter Finch's crime novels.As the movie progresses not only does Dormer have trouble sleeping, hence the title, but has to face his inner demons and mistakes he has made that have shaped an inescapable position. Pacino is brilliant in this film and plays well off of Robin Williams, who plays a surprisingly terrifying villain. I think this is another case of the acting in Nolan's films being overlooked. Nolan always creates great material for his actors to work with and puts them in perfect positions, but only one acting academy nomination has ever come from one of his films. I'm not sure Williams or Pacino's performances should have won Oscars but they are definitely under-appreciated.It's hard not to mention Hilary Swank who gives another incredible performance in a movie that she could have easily been overshadowed by two of the all time greats. Insomnia is one of the all time great crime films and I really hope that after Interstellar Nolan moves back into that genre and maybe even brings back Pacino for something. Perhaps something less cerebral than Inception but captures the intensity that Insomnia does, with the incredible characters of The Prestige.

Aquaman," Flawed but Undeniably Fun
","Is Aquaman the savior for the DCEU like people want it to be? Well, I would lean towards saying no, but it's far from the disaster some may have expected. James Wan not only brings a new flavor to the universe, but makes a separate entry into a series that desperately needed it.There are two mindsets at play here, one being that Wan 'clearly' meant to make a overly dramatic and bombastic adventure with cheesy dialogue, the other that the film is a tonal mess that at times takes itself far too serious, and at other times, almost having too much fun. I fall somewhere in the middle. I can acknowledge that a film that has a massive octopus playing the drums under water has a certain sense of self awareness, but there's no doubt in my mind that the mixture of tones just doesn't work in some moments.Jason Momoa is the perfect Aquaman/Arthur Curry and I'm mad that I had any doubt over his casting all those years ago. Despite not having the best chemistry romantically, his love interest Mera (Amber Heard) plays well off of him. When they aren't making out in the midst of an all out under water war, they share some of the best action scenes of the film, including a rooftop chase that displays the true genius behind Wan's framing/camera work.I could have completely done without Black Manta as it felt very much like the unnecessary presence of Baron Mordo in Doctor Strange. Also, his costume is absolutely absurd, and I don't care how close it is to the comic book iteration of Manta. The other villain, Patrick Wilson's 'Oceanmaster', is an overcooked & cliched power hungry super villain that did next to nothing for me. There's a good antagonist in there somewhere for Aquaman, but it sure wasn't in this origin story.I'd be remiss not to mention Nicole Kidman, considering how great of a year she is having, and her turn as Atlanna is no different. Owning her action sequences and elevating all of her dialogue, Kidman is likely the most memorable thing from the film, and I hope to see more of her character at some point or another.Extravagant, colorful, bombastic, a tonal mess, and cheesy, Aquaman is right around where I expected it would be. And hopefully the beginning of a new era of DC movies. Here's hoping.7.5/10",7,3,7,27 December 2018
My Neighbor Totoro," Untapped Imagination
","I think everyone can enjoy a good family film every once in awhile, especially when it's directed by the genius Hayao Miyazaki. He always finds the right mix of fantastical imagination with real heartwarming material. While I think My Neighbor Totoro is a good film, it's nowhere near his best. It explores the relationship between big and little sister, but also people dealing with a difficult situation in life. And sometimes that's when your imagination is at it's highest.It starts off pretty slow, and we don't actually get to see Totoro for about 20 minutes, but when we do the film takes a big jump in quality. A child's imagination is something that is only understood if you have had the same imagination at some point in your life. I remember the days of pretending I had other friends and creatures who would join me on my own adventures. So I can definitely relate to Mei and Satsuki. I think a better film for this would probably be Spirited Away, but it's nonetheless an enjoyable ride. The last 15 minutes or so are really touching. I loved all of the family moments, including their forest family.So Miyazaki has another heartwarming animated feature to his repertoire, but it falls short of the greatness of Spirited Away or even Howl's Moving Castle.+Touching +Imaginative +Totoro is so welcoming -Slow start -Could have been even more fantastical 7.0/10",7,0,1,18 February 2015
Concussion," Finish the Game
","It's really amazing just how powerful the NFL is. They control a day of the week (as the movie clearly states) and they allegedly even tried to get the filmmakers for Concussion to cut down on some of the film's harsher segments. Some have said that the film doesn't go after the NFL enough for its concussion issues, which I can somewhat agree with, but I also think the film did a good job balancing the science behind concussions and how much denial went on for years from the NFL towards these particular doctors.Will Smith plays the lead doctor, Bennet Omalu, behind the finding of brain issues in former NFL players and what is now known as CTE. We get a look at a handful of the hundreds upon hundreds of NFL players who have had brain issues including Dave Duerson and Mike Wesbter. Both were incredibly vital in Omalu's path to finding CTE and proving the NFL that it is in fact a real issue and maybe even an epidemic.We also get a look at Dr. Omalu's personal life with his wife, Prema Mutiso, played by Gugu Mbatha-Raw. At first, their relationship doesn't necessarily fit in with the rest of the film and for awhile it becomes a distraction. With that said, their chemistry is very good and Smith's performance thrives alongside Mbatha-Raw. I would almost go as far as saying Smith's performance is probably better than the film itself.It takes awhile to get going but once it does Concussion is an interesting watch. What the NFL did to protect itself (and really STILL doing) is fascinating. Smith brings life to the film with his unrecognizable performance, but it doesn't give the NFL the punch it probably deserves and you don't leave the theater knowing much more than you probably did. Even with all that, Concussion is worth the price of admission.+Smith gives his best performance in years+Fascinating science+Supporting performances and chemistry between characters-Pulls some punches-Some unnecessary focus on Omalu's personal life at times7.4/10",7,3,7,27 December 2015
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Triples the Spectacle
","When push comes to shove, the Pirates films are about one thing and one thing only, entertainment. Amidst all of the nonsensical humor and action, I don't know how you wouldn't at least be entertained by what Johnny Depp & company had to offer.At World's End once again doubles down on everything that made the second film ridiculously fun. Except this time the film is a solid 2 hours and 48 minutes long. I guess if you're going to spend 300 million dollars on a film might as well make it lengthy, right? The length and it's convoluted and wandering plot are sure to annoy some viewers (it certainly annoyed me), but there's more than enough to make this another worthy entry in Disney's bankable series.After Beckett and the Navy managed to steal Davy Jones' heart and impose a ban on pirates across the seas, Will, Elizabeth, and Barbossa must form an alliance to find Jack Sparrow and come together for one final battle. There's a lot to like here, including some of the best choreographed and shot action of the entire series. Merely analyzing the final 35 minutes was enough to get my blood flowing. This series has never shied away from going all out with action and escapades, and At World's End is no different. I'm not even sure 50 percent of the films made today look half as good as this film does. However, there are always downsides to relying heavily on the spectacle.As I mentioned with Dead Man's Chest, the spectacle overtook any sort of uniqueness or cleverness to the script that made the first adventure so fresh. Johnny Depp is way past the point of over-the- top, and so is the film. You feel like there's real danger in the first film, but most of that is gone by the supernatural and fantastical elements they bring in here. Nobody expected to see Sparrow sit an entire film out after being eaten by the Kraken last film, but it sure seemed pretty easy to get him back. And when we do get him back, he spends most of his time talking to hallucinated versions of himself that refuse to go away. The plot also tends to always fall back on one member of the crew being either 'missing' or 'captured' by another ship/crew. It gets tiring after a while.I think they set out to make the biggest adventure possible, and you have to give the people involved credit for truly bringing it. But I can completely understand where people get tired of mindless action without much wit and far less charm than the first film had. But hey, I'm still having a blast going back and re-watching some of my childhood favorites.+Spectacle is unmatched+Zimmer's score is epic+Jaw-dropping action-Plot wanders-Lengthy7.8/10",7,0,1,26 May 2017
Deadpool 2," Almost as Good as the First
","There may not be a single superhero franchise more perfect for 2018. Staying irreverent, hilarious, ultraviolent, creative, and downright insane, Deadpool 2 is loads of fun even if it doesn't quite live up to the originals fresh tone. Bringing in John Wick 2 director David Leitch to take over for Tim Miller, this film improves upon its action and brings in plenty of characters for Deadpool to mess around with, introducing members of X-Force. Which, by the way, made for one of the most shockingly funny sequences I have ever seen in a comic book movie. There's something to be said for making a sequel bigger and better, but perhaps even more impressive is when a film manages to bring a balance of that and resisting the temptation to do so. I loved most of the additional characters, including Domino (who was the clear highlight), Cable, and a few other characters with less dialogue. With that said, I do think the thing this film was missing was more Morena Baccarin and her relationship with Wade/Deadpool. The film takes a particular direction with this arc and it could be slightly controversial, I was on the fence for most of it with this decision. And while the film is still, in a way, about their relationship, I think it takes a backseat to some newer characters and their arcs.Without going into too much detail, the film also takes an interesting and bold approach to its antagonist(s). It was another element that I'm still not sure how much I like and how much I feel was a missed opportunity. But even with all of this said, I still found myself entertained from beginning to end, with laugh out loud 4th wall breaks and gags throughout. And I'm really just scratching the surface with how good some of this movie is. There are just a few small things that didn't necessarily hit the right note with me, but this could very well chang upon second viewing.8.8/10",8,1,3,23 May 2018
X-Men," Where it All Began
","It's hard to believe Hugh Jackman has been playing Wolverine for 17 years now. 'Logan' is just around the corner and it's time to take a deeper look at all of the times Jackman has graced the screen as the legendary comic-book character.X-Men (2000) hasn't particularly aged as well visually as some other superhero films, but the story is just as relevant as it's always been. It's nice to go back and watch the beginning of it all again after two separate trilogies and a few spin-offs. And just like in every other X-Men film, it always comes down to Charles and Erik. Professor X and Magneto have probably the most fascinatingly complicated relationship in comics. Charles wants everyone to get along and make peace with the humans, while Erik has always believed humans will inevitably turn on mutant kind. What makes the dynamic so great is that neither are 100% right. The only major problem with Erik is that he usually involves killing. Even in 2017 we are having issues with accepting people who are different than us. That's what sadly makes these X-Men films so relevant and timeless.With that said, there are certain aspects of the film that are more than dated. Storm's inconsistent accent is awkward at best, and Halle Berry doesn't really add anything of value (at least in this film). Sabretooth and Toad are nothing more than pawns for Magneto's use. Some could even say Mystique is one as well, but at least she has some cool action sequences. Mystique adds to the plot with the Senator, but I don't understand the reason for Toad or Sabretooth. Perhaps there just wasn't enough time to cover their motivations in a breezy 105 minute film. On the good side of things, Anna Paquin gives a strong turn as Rogue, Famke Janssen brings an appealing gracefulness to Jean Grey, and Jackman as Wolverine may have been the most brilliant casting in any comic-book property. The early films hold up because of the incredible characters, and not necessarily because they have the most memorable stories or visual flare.It's always nice to see how far characters have come and see where it all started. For the widely popular X-Men franchise, this is where the countless continuity issues began, when the team first suited up, and where Jackman first donned the claws. It doesn't have the narrative scope or the dazzling visuals that the films do now, but it will always hold a special place in my heart. +Where it all began+Story is still relevant+Charles vs Erik+Dynamics between characters-But really, what's the point of Sabretooth or Toad-Berry's accent7.8/10",7,2,4,15 February 2017
Spider-Man 3," We Always Have a Choice
","Ah, the Spider-Man film that nearly ruined the franchise, Spider-Man 3. Like the previous two films, there's a tremendous amount of nostalgia attached to this film for me. This was the first trilogy of superhero films that I connected with, and at 13 years-old I was willing to forgive many of the mistakes this film made, most of which I cannot forgive a decade later.Only a few films have tried balancing more than one villain, Spider- Man 3 being the classic example of how not to do it. Apparently, the studio forced Venom on Sam Raimi and hence making Harry & Sandman's arc far less effective when the final act is bogged down by a silly attempt at bringing Venom to the big screen. None of the three villains are all that great, but there's at least some emotional undercurrent with both Sandman and Harry. Venom is, more or less, just a third act reveal that is meant to please fans. Only, it did the exact opposite.Another thing that definitely didn't win over fans was the fact that this film made Peter Parker an absolute jerk. It's one thing to have the symbiote change Peter, but it's another thing to have him physically abuse Mary Jane, and nearly kill his best friend Harry multiple times. This was far from the Peter Parker we came to love in the first two films.Another headache was the direction they took Harry Osborn. Having him get 'hit in the head' and lose his memory for half the film was one of the stupidest and laziest decisions I can remember from a comic-book film. I don't mind having Harry go the villainous route, but the memory loss was all a bit of a headache.There is good, however. Raimi, as he proved in the first two, is great at shooting high-scale action. The CGI is definitely dated when looking back on it after 10 years, but the action is as visceral as anything in any Spider-Man film to date. Yes, that includes 'Homecoming'. If only the dialogue surrounding the action could match the brutality. I also think Thomas Haden-Church's performance as Sandman is nothing to scoff at, reminding me of the character depth that made Doc Ock so memorable. At the end of the day, Raimi was trying to give us a Spider-Man film that dealt with bigger and more important personal issues, whether that worked for you or not is entirely up to the viewer.I think if Raimi had the tools that filmmakers have now (improved CGI) and perhaps a little less studio interference, then Spider-Man 3 could be a much better end to the trilogy than it ended up being. There's plenty I can't forgive about this film, especially the infamous 'dancing in the street' sequence, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be.+Action+Deals with real issues-But is sometimes careless in its execution-3 villains proved to be way too much-Memory loss for Harry5.8/10",5,0,2,12 July 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," The MCU is Back to Feeling Fresh
","I've defended the Thor franchise for being 2 of the more fun and innocent MCU films, and I mean innocent because nothing of major consequence really happens in either. Yes, Loki does take over Odin's seat in Thor: The Dark World, but other than that, they are relatively harmless and forgettable narratives. While Ragnarok doesn't shake up the MCU to the point that Captain America: Civil War did last year, it does however bring some of the funniest moments and greatest action to date.I'm glad that this isn't titled Thor 3: Ragnarok because it doesn't feel like a sequel to either Thor film at all. In fact, the only character(s) returning of any significance are Thor, Loki, Heimdall, and Odin. And you quickly realize that this film isn't trying to honor any story threads that happened in previous Thor outings. Luckily, Taika Waititi brings an entirely new direction to the fading MCU creativity. I don't wish to bring up the lack of originality in Spider-Man Homecoming, Guardians 2, or Doctor Strange, because they're essentially retreads of tired Marvel stories. But Ragnarok feels stylistically and thematically different from anything in the MCU to date. Of course, there are some frustrating aspects, but it's nothing that kills the movie for me.Continuing with the long list of great actors who don't really get a chance to shine as MCU villains, Cate Blanchett plays Hela, the goddess of death, who wants to bring the end of Asgard as we know it. Blanchett, much like Michael Keaton in this summer's Spider-Man, gives a serviceable performance and definitely feels distinct from previous villains, but ultimately is pushed to the side for developing the heroes more. It doesn't surprise me one bit, but I still can't help but feel a little let down we didn't get to see the 2 time Oscar winner shine a little more.The one thing I have been criticizing Marvel for the most of late is the humor. It's one thing when we get occasional quippy humor from Tony Stark or maybe some physical humor at the hands of Hulk & Loki, but the last few MCU films have just felt like punchline after punchline and I'm just getting tired of it. But for some reason, the humor works remarkably well with Ragnarok. It felt to me like Taika let us decide whether or not we should be laughing, whereas James Gunn and Guardians 2 basically shoved every joke down or throats several times over. I can't particularly put my finger on why Thor's humor worked so well, but it did, and it's gosh darn so flipping fun.The entire cast does a great job of presenting Taika's humor and direction to its fullest potential. Mark Ruffalo further proves why people want a Hulk standalone movie so bad, and is as good as he's ever been in Ragnarok. Tessa Thompson plays Valkyrie, a vicious and snarky bada** who joins Thor on the epic adventure. Idris Elba, Anthony Hopkins, and Benedict Cumberbatch reprise their previous MCU roles and all enhance the scenes they are in. And of course, Tom Hiddleston as Loki is still just as frustratingly charming as he was 6 years ago when he first debuted.The action is breathtaking (including one of the best openings to an MCU), the humor is outrageously amusing, and Taika's direction is exactly the jolt of energy the universe needed. Thor Ragnarok puts the MCU back on track.9.0/10",9,1,10,3 November 2017
Match Point," Woody Allen's most daring film
","This movie has many brilliant moments and ideas. But I think the best part of the movie is the first hour and 15 minutes. The romance of the first 90 minutes paved the way for what would be a violent and thrilling second half. Woody Allen shines in romance and storytelling, but that's also why I didn't find the last 30-40 minutes to be that compelling. When I saw that this movie was considered a 'Crime-Drama-Thriller' movie I got excited. Those are my favorite movies. But in reality its much more a 'Romance-Drama' than anything else. There is barely any crime, and you don't see much of it on screen. I almost wish Allen stuck with his guts and brought the story a different way and kept it in his Romance wheelhouse. Nevertheless, as any other Allen movie, it has great characters. And characters that you don't particular care to root for. That's always been one thing Woody Allen does best. He makes movies with humanized characters and that are very relatable to modern day problems going on with relationships. 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' and 'Blue Jasmine' are perfect examples of that. With 'Match Point' you don't know who to root for. In fact, I particularly liked Emily Mortimer's character much more than Scarlett Johansson's. Even the title character is quite annoying at times. But overall the film as a whole is very good. It's a really solid drama that could have been brilliant as a whole if the last 40 minutes could have stayed within the mood of the first 90 minutes. Still a very enjoyable movie. 7.8/10",7,0,0,16 March 2014
Resident Evil: Extinction," Borefest
","Resident Evil Extinction manages to dumb down the plot, action, and characters since the last film, which is an impressive 'accomplishment'. As hard as I try to get invested in this post- apocalyptic series, the series just keeps getting dumber.'Extinction' picks up a few years after the end of 'Apocalypse' as Alice left her group in hopes of keeping them safe from the remnants of Umbrella Corp, who are tracking Alice in order to produce more of the anti-virus. Meanwhile, Alice's life of solitude has apparently given her telekinetic abilities. Yes, it's just that ridiculous. But even with another new setting in the desert (ala Mad Max), the plot never takes any exciting twists and turns. In fact, I'm not entirely sure what any of the characters were ultimately trying to accomplish.Characters that I thought were supposed to be important are either non- existent or given anti-climatic deaths. Plus, the zombies (or whatever they are calling the undead creatures) are now able to run around and climb on top of cars and buildings? I don't know about that.Do I enjoy seeing Milla Jovovich in this role? Of course. She's been a constant bright spot through each of the first three films, but I find it hard to believe that it's enough to give a film like this a positive review. Iain Glenn is fittingly over-the-top, but why in the world does he turn into a prototypical monster in the end? At that point, the film is expectedly off the rails.

Youth," Wistful
","Michael Caine never fails to surprise me. He's one of the most accomplished actors of all time and yet, a performance like his in Youth, is still quite astonishing.Caine, like a few other elder actors who I won't name, still do quite a few movies these days. But some can clearly be seen as 'paycheck' movies. Now, I've never seen a bad performance from Caine, actually I'm not sure if he's ever had a below average performance, but sometimes he takes roles that just don't seem to make much sense. I enjoy the Now You See Me movies for what they are, but there's no real reason for Caine to be in them.With that said, Youth is as good as I've seen Caine in years. It's a starring role with layers of emotion and character depth, which is something Caine just hasn't been given of late. The film itself has its beautiful moments, but Caine was the reason I was invested. He plays a retired composer, Fred, who is being sought out by the Queen for a performance of one of his most beloved songs, only personal reasons get in his way. But the film isn't really about that performance at all. In fact, it's really a story about regret, wistfulness, and deprivation.Fred spends his time reflecting on his life at a secluded resort in the Swiss Alps with his longtime friend and film director, Mick, played by Harvey Keitel. These conversations give the film a poignantly nostalgic feel, but it's also not an overwhelmingly depressing take on life either. Neither actor has been this invested in a role in years, and thus it's a bittersweet film, especially considering the age and career path of both the actors in real life.The one thing that didn't work too well for me was the use of dream- like sequences to hammer home the main themes and ideas. I got the message I needed through the actors and script, so I wasn't a huge fan of Paolo Sorrentino continuously using this storytelling method. Alas, the rest of his directing job should be commended.Even though most of the film consists of the main characters going through their daily motions and routines, I found the message of doing something with your life and not wasting time to be incredibly effective. Some memories wash away but the ones that stick are truly the important ones. Youth was really a nice little film that was largely lost in the shuffle with the rest of the industry.

The Prestige," Are You Watching Closely?
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.The Prestige is another one of Christopher Nolan's non-linear films that gets better after every time you watch it. It's one of the reasons his films make incredible amounts of money. They require you to go back to the theater and re-watch the film any number of times. I love everything about The Prestige. It has two of my favorite film characters of all time in Alfred Borden and Robert Angier. Both are incredibly deep characters that seek power and legacy. They are rival magicians who get caught up in besting the other and tend to lose people closest to them along the way.It's non-linear structure works to it's benefit by showing flashbacks and flash forwards of them reading each other's diary which has the many tricks each of them have used. As we find out more about each character, we find out that it's become a lot more personal between the two than we previously thought. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give terrific performances that have become a bit understated. But the men aren't the only ones who give great performances, as Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall give incredibly powerful performances as well. Hall hadn't been in any big movie to this point so her ability to hold her own up against Bale and Jackman is unprecedented. Scarlett is as sexy as ever but also surprisingly effective as an assistant to both of them at various points in the film. It's another film that you don't really want to know a lot going in without being spoiled. All I can say is, you will be shocked enough to press play again once the credits roll.Nolan's work here (in only a few month shoot & production) is impeccable. He is quite simply one of the greatest storytellers we have today and has an incredible knack for interweaving multiple story lines and a complicated script into something extraordinary. He's also the best at ending a story. Every one of the endings to his films have been perfect and stayed true to his respected characters. I hope Interstellar gives us another memorable ending for the ages.+Bale & Jackman +Friendship that became a rivalry +Nolan's effective non-linear structure +Hall & Johansson's powerful performances +That ending though..10/10",10,3,6,6 November 2014
Cloverfield," Found Footage Masterpiece
","Even though it supposedly doesn't have a ton of links to the original, I thought it may be a good idea to take back at Cloverfield in preparation for the forthcoming 10 Cloverfield Lane. Cloverfield is about a group of friends attending a going away party in New York City when suddenly a gigantic creature attacks the city. The group is thrust into the unbelievable task of making their way through the streets of New York in hopes of saving one of their friends.In an era where the term found footage films started to become a gimmick that people scoffed at, Cloverfield manages to make use of its filming technique to perfection. More impressive though, is the filmmakers ability to get us to care about each and every one of the main characters so that when an emotional scene arrives, we feel for them. Matt Reeves and JJ Abrams did a wonderful job of bringing this film to life as the director and producer respectively. Not only is the film incredibly original in its story telling, but the special effects and realistic take on a monster invasion felt so refreshing to watch. Not everybody makes it out alive and when people die, you don't see it coming. That to me, is a film that nails exactly what its going for.The cast wasn't and to a certain extent still isn't all that well- known. TJ Miller and Lizzy Caplan being the exceptions as they have broken out into fame. Even with that said, I thought the performances all around were exceptional. I got the vibe from all of the characters that they were really seeing a monster/creatures for the first time and the decision to use hand-held cameras was extremely effective. Miller was perfect for the character who filmed everything as he brought just the right amount of humor and terror to every scene. I also believed and cared for the love story they were trying to sell me on with Rob trying to reach Beth for a good portion of the film.In many ways, Cloverfield is a look inside the lives of people who would be on the streets in any invasion/superhero film. Perhaps rightfully so, we don't really ever get a chance to see from a normal person's view of the events. The emotion and humor are definitely present, and the action is also handled extremely well as there are a fair share of necessary jump scares. Cloverfield is easily my favorite found footage film along with one of the best invasion sci-fi films of the last decade or so.+Reeves & Abrams direction+Scary & haunting at times+Performances+Found footage choice made sense+Balance of humor and emotion was on point8.7/10",8,0,0,18 February 2016
Sleepy Hollow," Eerie Gothic Entertainment
","Sleepy Hollow manages to impressively balance out a brutally graphic premise with an interesting mystery and decidedly timely humor. It's easily one of Tim Burton's most entertaining adventures to date.Period pieces are ripe for great horror flicks. To me, the creepiest film of 2016 has been The Witch, and that's large part due to the eerie 17th century setting on a secluded farm. Sleepy Hollow is a much more habited town, but the same eerie tone is set brilliantly by cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I love the way he and Burton used the town itself as a character which is a part of the mystery. Speaking of the mystery, It's nice to see Burton tackle a mystery, which I believe is the only time he's ever ventured into that genre. And he handles it well for the most part. A good portion of the film focuses on why exactly a headless horseman is taking out certain members of the Sleepy Hollow community, with Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane at the center of the investigation. Crane, in typical Burton fashion, is a bit of an eccentric and unpredictable twist to his detective style. But the real issue with some of the mystery is that the third act reveals come at a rapid pace and the story gets a little convoluted.With that said, once we get caught up as an audience, Burton gives us a juicy climatic showdown with the infamous horseman, and it doesn't disappoint. He's done a few horror films, but Sleepy Hollow ranks up there with some of his best overall features. It has his distinguished tone and style with plenty of colorful kills by one of the great horror villains of all time, the headless horseman. An awkward romance and a somewhat convoluted third act prevent it from being flawless, but it's more than just your average horror entertainment.+Lubezki+Burton hits all the right beats+Amazing climax+Well-crafted-Iffy romance-Somewhat confusing reveals9.0/10",9,3,4,25 September 2016
Ready Player One," A Nerd's Nerd Film
","Ready Player One is quite possibly the biggest 'nerd's nerd film'. What I mean by that is that sure the film can be appreciated by the general public, but there's no question that the large part of the population that goes to see it won't be able to truly appreciate the ins and outs of this Easter egg filled movie. Dozens and probably even closer to hundreds of hidden gems fill this Sci-fi feature helmed by one of the all-time greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. If there's ever a film you wish you could pause, zoom-in, and rewind while in the theater, it's Ready Player One.There is of course, the disappointing element of the film you have to get over, which is that a good chunk of the film (maybe 75%) is in CGI. Once you get passed the fact that the characters you're supposed to grapple onto, and the environments they inhabit, are entirely fake, then there's not much stopping you from having a blast. I thought the performances by Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Ben Mendelsohn were all very good, and in Cooke's case, great. The effects and cinematography were about as good as you're going to get without going over budget. And the script was above average.However, the real journey you go to the theater for is the mystery, easter eggs, and the surprises. Boy were there a ton of them here. There's one particular scene, which was somehow not spoiled by any marketing or journalist, that is one of the coolest film sequences I have seen in quite some time. And Spielberg really does a nice job of appealing to the older generations as well as the newer generations. What a ride this film was.8.8/10",8,0,1,13 April 2018

","While The Hateful Eight is nowhere near Tarantino's best work, it's still a very enjoyable piece of art. I think that's what Tarantino makes, works of art. Art is always up for interpretation and The Hateful Eight is really no different. Saying it's not his best work doesn't mean much considering he has made some of the most significant and influential films of the past 25 years. Even though I would probably rank it 6th among all of his films, there's plenty to love about the film.First and foremost, the performances are great, in particular Jennifer Jason Leigh and Samuel L. Jackson. Although I will say, Tim Roth's character had to be written for Christoph Waltz in mind because his character feels a lot like Waltz' character in Django or Inglorious Basterds. Tarantino's script is good but it doesn't leap off the pages like his other films do. I can't really see it having too many lines that are quoted for years to come like Django or Pulp Fiction. The rest of the eight (or really 9 people) that fill the cabin during a massive blizzard have some good moments, but no scene will really blow you away. Tarantino's ultra violent style is present, but the film's structure is much more in the vain of Reservoir Dogs than it is Django or Inglorious Basterds. I really expected this film to be a 3 hour version of the pub scene in Inglorious Basterds, and it wasn't. The tension just wasn't there. As much as I loved Ennio Morricone's score, it didn't really add to the film in the way I hoped.I'm not sure if it was a lack of development in the characters, (because you really only get to know half of them), or maybe it's just that my expectations were so high, but The Hateful Eight turned out to be a good but not great outing at the movies. Tarantino does however do a great job at setting the scene throughout the film in terms of the blizzard and freezing atmosphere the characters are surrounded in. So much so that the man sitting next to me mentioned to his friend that he was feeling cold just by watching the film.The film presents itself as a mystery in the same vein as Clue or even Murder by Death and it does have some surprises along the way where you find yourself guessing throughout. With that said, I'm not sure the result is worth the 3 hour wait. I'm not totally sure Tarantino needed to make it that long. The Hateful Eight is worth seeing though, but maybe it's a film you see at your house where you can pause it every chapter instead of one long viewing.+Tarantino setting the scene and scope of the film very well+Performances, particularly Jackson and Leigh+Morricone's fantastic score+Some surprises-Not as memorable as some of his other films-Length may not be warranted7.7/10",7,2,18,2 January 2016
"I, Tonya"," A Bunch of Entertaining Gillooly
","It's often difficult to find the balance of portraying real life events accurately and delicately. And I say delicately because there's so many times when movies take the approach of brushing over real life events with a cheap and safe version of what actually happened. Vague, but true. However, I, Tonya throws all of that out the window by telling a fascinatingly outrageous story of Tonya Harding's upbringing, triumph, and of course the downfall following the Nancy Kerrigan attack.
The attack may be what you go to see the movie for, but it's far from the centerpiece of this ridiculously ridiculous film. And yes, I just said that. I, Tonya has irreverent humor with an underlying sense of heart (which I didn't expect), and oh it's also filled with the most vacuous of characters/real humans. You will walk out of the theater asking yourself, 'did all of this really happen?', and the most likely answer is yes.
Director Craig Gillespie, who has done films like The Finest Hours and Million Dollar Arm stepped into unchartered territory with I, Tonya, and did so rather well. Whether it be fourth-wall breaking, heightening scenes to improve the effect, or even shooting visceral ice skating sequences, the energy of this film never stops.
Gillespie isn't the only hero of this movie, as it's hard to overlook the performances of Margot Robbie and Allison Janney as Tonya and her mother respectively. Producing as well, Robbie is clearly devoted to this role and it sure looks like she'll get some gold this awards season because of it. Her counterpart, Janney, may do exactly the same, as a scene stealer and brutally relentless mother. If I were a betting man, I may put my money that those two to win this Oscar's. So a wild story, told in an insanely entertaining way, makes for one enjoyable 120 minutes.

Molly's Game," A Game of Skill
","It's no shock that Aaron Sorkin's directorial debut has one of the best screenplays and one of the most fast-paced but intricately thought out plots of the year. Molly's game not only is a fascinating biopic but an impressively acted piece all around, but particularly with Idris Elba and Jessica Chastain. Molly Bloom, a former olympic worthy skier, became the leader of the world's most exclusive and underground poker game in the world. That in itself is a fascinating story worthy of sort sort of film. But couple that with the fact that the poker players included some of the most famous actors, athletes, musicians, and Wall Street representatives in the world makes Molly's Game addicting to watch. It's hard to take your eyes off the events as it never seems to let up. Even if it's over 2 hours and 20 minutes, the film never stops being interesting.That's in large part thanks to Sorkin's direction of the lengthy dialogue scenes, particularly the sequences involving Elba and Chastain's back and forth in an office. Sometimes all it takes to progress the plot and provide a jolt of energy is putting two incredible actors in the same room. Yes, those scenes are impeccably written, but it also brings this larger than life story back to reality and adds humanity to the main character of Molly.Complementing those scenes are a few involving Molly's father played by Kevin Costner. It's an impressive feat to get a grown man to tear up and feel emotion towards a person who's out of the realm of relatability, but that's not the case at all. Molly Bloom goes through quite the arc in this film, and it all comes back to the incredible adaptation that Sorkin does with this screenplay. Performances, writing, and a brilliant direction from Sorkin makes Molly's Game a thrilling, yet also emotionally satisfying piece of cinema.9.2/10",9,1,4,3 January 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Doesn't live up to the hype
","I am a big fan of westerns, and of Newman and Redford. I think the Sting is one of the greatest crime movies of all time. But this movie just isn't that exciting. It doesn't have those memorable moments that a lot of these classic westerns do. You would think with the star-power they would make the average script a classic, but I guess not in my books. I know a lot of people love this movie, but like Blade Runner, I just don't see why.To start, there just isn't much plot. The premise is they steal money and then runaway from bad guys (who by the way you never even get to really see). I would have been fine if they built up these bad guys like the did and then at the end have a classic gun fight, but it turns out its with a foreign country at the end instead of the guys who have been chasing them the whole time. Also, how do they get back to Katharine Ross' character? weren't they chased without horses miles away? Then the next morning they are all of a sudden there. Maybe that's nitpicking but if I noticed it, its a mistake. I just felt like this movie fell short on several levels.But even though I didn't like the end bad guys, I did like the final gun fight, I thought it at least put some excitement onto a rather boring movie. Besides the negatives I did think Newman and Redford were fine in their roles but I cant say I will remember anything particular that they said to each other. I realize all film is subjective, and most people love this movie, but that's just not me.6.7/10",6,1,1,3 April 2014
Moana," Another Lively & Gorgeous Entry for Disney's Revival Era
","I can't remember a better year for animation than 2016. Moana adds to this year's trend of progressing the limits of animation while giving stories for both children and adults.Continuing the Disney Revival era of animation, Moana provides endless charm with its two leads, and an opportunity for audiences to see a much different and diverse story portrayed on screen. Not a true musical per-say, but Moana contains some of the catchiest, heartfelt, and downright colorful musical numbers of the year. Thanks to help from Lin-Manuel Miranda, this soundtrack is bound to top the charts and awards season.Luckily, it isn't just the songs that will stick with you long after the theater, gorgeous animation and a heart-warming story flood Disney's latest hit. The filmmakers notably took plenty of time in researching the lives and culture of those living in the South Pacific, and it showed. Even if there were liberties taken, I loved learning about these people and how they lived their lives. It's a timeless adventure story that doesn't rely on pop culture references or screwball humor, instead, its layered lore and appealing leads pave the way for a glorious experience.What also struck me was the immense detail that went into making Moana. Everything from Maui's tattoos to the lively ocean, this may be the most beautiful animated film to date. Ironically, it will be up against Kubo & the Two Strings come awards season, and they both share many qualities. Both have groundbreaking animation, fantastical and mythological characters, and a coming of age story of a youth growing into a leader.I think the only weaknesses were with the pacing and its villain. Not unlike Frozen in that the antagonistic elements aren't really present until the third act. It's not an overwhelming negative considering the film does just fine without a true villain, but the absence is definitely felt at times. The middle act also is a little slow, and I wasn't a big fan of one particular character introduced about halfway through, but the third act was truly remarkable.So even though I thought having The Rock sing or casting a completely unknown in the title role was a risk, it couldn't have turned out better for Disney's next chapter in their revival. Plenty of well- strung songs, detailed animation, and a thoughtfully important story makes Moana one of the best animated movies in quite some time, and certainly of 2016.+Brilliant songs+Detailed animation+Heart-warming story+Different & diverse Disney film-Middle act slows9.3/10",9,9,25,19 December 2016
BlacKkKlansman," A Powerful Message that Gets Unfortunately Forced on the Audience
","Spike Lee's films have never really resonated with me for whatever reason. BlacKkKlansman is a fascinating story with an average execution at best. Lee brings some solid performances out of Adam Driver and John David Washington, but I'm not sure those characters are fleshed out as much as they should be. But my problem doesn't come with the actors or story per say, but more so with the message that is shoved down your throat. The very beginning and end of this movie present a particular message that is prevalent throughout the film on its own, without the book end scenes. It's a powerful message and reminder for our country, which is still going through its own version of the racism shown in the movie. Perhaps more subtle directing and a better 3rd act would have given this a higher score.6.4/10",6,139,245,26 August 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man
","What Marvel has done with their universe to this point is unprecedented. Nobody could have imagined the MCU would become this large and this popular, nor that two major studios would collaborate with each other. With that said, there's something about it that's starting to feel a little stale. I enjoyed Spider-Man: Homecoming quite a bit, but I would have preferred it to not be as safe as it is.Let's start with the positives. Tom Holland is just about as good of a Spider-Man/Peter Parker as you can ask for. For the first time, it actually feels like Peter Parker is in high school, and not a grown adult playing a high school student. I'm always going to be partial to Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man for nostalgic reasons, and I definitely love Andrew Garfield's portrayal, but Holland is undeniably great as the web slinger. As is most of the cast. Michael Keaton's return to the superhero genre shouldn't be understated. He's so dang good as Vulture to the point where if it wasn't Keaton (or a really good actor), the character would be forgettable. There's a particular scene in the car where he really shines.One of the things that separates this Spider-Man from previous incarnations is the fact that he's in high school, and that particular direction they take does feel refreshing in a sense. I know some people would prefer a Spider-Man who is older and can stand alongside the other Marvel characters with age and maturity, but I think the real charm with Holland is that he's so different from the other MCU characters. Seeing his perspective pitted up against Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Tony Stark is something to behold. In the same breath, it was nice having a younger and more relatable Aunt May, played by Marisa Tomei, at Peter's side.I think where the film starts to get frustrating is that is just feels too safe. When I go back and re-watch Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy or even both of the Garfield films, I feel like they had more of an emotional attachment and connection. I'm not saying this film needed to film yet another heartbreaking Uncle Ben death scene, but I wish I felt more of a connection to the supporting characters. I feel like because Spider-Man is now a part of the MCU, the creativity went out the door a little bit and thus giving us what is essentially the same film as Iron Man, Ant-Man, or Doctor Strange. Of course, all of these movies deal with different characters with different powers, but the approach and execution are pretty much all the same. It's not necessarily a bad thing that MCU is consistent with how they make their movies, but I would like there to be more of an individualized feel to them.I love the fact that Spider-Man is as relatable as he is as a high school kid. I love that they didn't bombard us with Tony Stark and kept his role to a minimum. I love Tomei as Aunt May. I love Jacob Batalon as Ned (Perfect casting!). I love seeing the return of Happy Hogan and Pepper Potts. Heck, I even really like Michael Giacchino's score a whole lot more than I thought. But the one thing I keep coming back to with the MCU is how uninventive the last few films have been. With the exception of the Cap and Avengers films, it feels more like these films exist solely to set up the next one, instead of standing by themselves as singularly great stories. Perhaps that's just my two cents. Hopefully Marvel and Sony can build on what they've started and deliver a great sequel.+Holland is perfect+Good to see him back in high school+Aunt May is always a great complement to Peter+A lot of jokes hit-But some at the wrong time-Lacks uniqueness7.7/10",7,7,12,10 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Upping the Ante
","I've said it many times before, but one of the main reasons why the F&F movies failed to reach mass appeal before Fast Five was because of their villains. They were always forced to take on low end drug dealers and people who have little to do with their line of work; driving cars really fast and stealing things. With Fast & Furious 6, the team gets to take on Owen Shaw & his own crew, who are equally as good at doing crazy stuff on wheels.Dom regathers his team, including Brian, Han, Gisele, Roman, and Tej, after Hobbs comes to him with an offer he can't refuse. The chance to save Letty from Shaw and take him down, in exchange for full pardons all the way around. After quite a few films on the run and unable to return to his home in Los Angeles, there's no way he could turn down this opportunity, even if it meant going up against his former girlfriend thought dead, Letty. Fast & Furious 6 has even more muscle, explosions, faster cars, and just downright insanity. But it isn't as clean cut or polished as Fast Five. Granted, a movie like this doesn't necessarily need to have a concise story or developed characters, but they've done a much better job at doing those things within the last few films. The 6th film feels a little slower and maybe even a little too long, with the end product still putting a huge smile on my face. But when comparing the two, a second watch definitely exposes some of this film's minor flaws.The one thing this film, and pretty much all of the films since 4, is that each keeps topping itself. Just when you think they couldn't top stealing a vault and dragging across the streets of Brazil, they take down planes with cars. The tone deafness of the series is gone and the new breed of F&F is here to stay. The crazy thing is, you buy into all of it. I bought into the family from the beginning and I one-hundred-percent buy into the series embracing it's goofiness. The film also manages to implement more humor into the 6th film which is something the franchise has been missing. Or at least, humor that actually makes people laugh. I won't count those horrible attempts at humor in the 2nd film.What makes this film stick out his that it's the first time the crew gets to go up against an entirely new crew with the same set of skills. Luke Evans is great as Owen Shaw, The Rock has never been better, and who doesn't love watching Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson crack one- liners at each other. Better yet, every word out of Vin's mouth is a one-liner. Overall, the ante is once against raised and the series punches its way through another smash hit. Fast & Furious 6 is an insane thrill ride from the beginning to end.+Owen Shaw+Team vs Team+Rock & Vin working together+Always pushing the genre and series to a new level-A bit slower & a tad too long9.1/10",9,2,3,13 April 2017
Pan's Labyrinth," Innocence Among Brutality
","If not for anything else, you can count on Guillermo del Toro's films to have an incredible amount of imagination and originality. With Pan's Labyrinth comes perhaps his most widely beloved film, a story about innocence and brutality, and how it can all coincide beautifully and tragically during wartime. I was always engaged and invested in the young Ofelia's story, but I'm not sure both stories (being the war politcals of it all, and Ofelia's journey to return to her homeland) flowed as much as it could have. At the very least, the powerful imagery, and great combination of special & practical effects made it worth it.6.6/10",6,1,2,23 March 2019
Begin Again," Pleasant Surprise
","Whether or not you're a big music fan, I think Begin Again will be an enjoyable watch. It's actually not what I thought it would be. I expected more of a sappy romantic comedy with a whole bunch of music plugs for famous artists. Sure, there are a few of those, but it never takes away from the film in general. Plus Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo have great chemistry together.Ruffalo plays a washed up alcoholic record label manager. He has had his fair share of family issues and career obstacles but he has enough friends to keep him around a little longer. Knightley plays a woman grieving over her the recent break up with her boyfriend (Levine) and just hopes people hear her songs the way she hears them. The chance encounter between the two at the bar sparks an unlikely friendship and many cool songs. They decide to start a band that records their songs independently and outside in New York City. It's a pretty cool idea to have all the ambient sound in the background which gives you a true city life experience. Apparently it is Knightley singing in all these songs which is good to hear, though most have been edited in the studio. I think it would have been even better if they filmed and recorded these songs ACTUALLY outside during production of the movie. It would have given it such a natural feel to it.The film goes back and forth between Gretta's rebuilding of her life since her break up, and Dan's trouble reconnecting with his daughter and ex-wife. I liked this approach, but I do think it would have benefited more if it focused on the band and the relationship between Dan and Gretta. I didn't find the Adam Levine story to be interesting at all, in fact I think it was a pretty poor effort. But when you break the film down and realize it does what it set out to do, which is telling a story about two people who need new beginnings in their lives. It's a sweet and harmless tale that most people can enjoy.+Fascinating idea +Chemistry between our leads +Feel good film +Catchy songs -Could have actually recorded outside -Levine's storyline 7.3/10",7,0,2,9 March 2015
Alien," No One Can Hear You Scream
","When you talk about the greatest science fiction films ever made, you have to at least include the original Alien in the conversation. It spawned an entire franchise, sure, but it also inspired an entire generation of filmmakers that still resonates throughout filmmaking today. It's often imitated, but never duplicated.I love going back and re-watching this film because it's one of the few horror films I can remember that isn't tarnished upon second viewing. It's always hard to make a film that is just as good the second time around, but it's particularly challenging with horror films. There's something about knowing when each scare is coming and knowing who gets killed off first that usually ruins the fun. However, 1979's Alien is quite the achievement in transcending the 'trapped in a confined space' genre.The one thing that always shines through with Alien is Ridley Scott's vision. He's one of those directors that when he's on top of his game, there's no one better at displaying a singular vision for filmmaking. He was certainly inspired by a few sci-fi's that came before like 2001 or maybe even Forbidden Planet, but Alien is its own entity. And boy does it possess one particular entity that scared an entire generation.Much like the entire film around it, the Xenomorph is a fascinating piece of art. I love H.R. Giger's design. I love its origin. I love that its hidden for half the film. I love that there's actually a human underneath all that terrifying skin. Heck, I love that this thing has two mouths, both just as horrifying as the other. The Xenomorph is as much the star of this film as Sigourney Weaver is, and they both complement each other brilliantly, as strange as that sounds.But let's talk about Weaver & the crew. If there's ever a memorable crew in one of these space mission films, it's in Alien. And the crazy thing is, you don't necessarily get to know any of them in depth to care about their health and well-being. Most of the film is spent in silence, which makes it all the more powerful when the Alien does attack. Sometime less is more, huh? In its entirety, Alien is one of the greatest films ever made, and easily one of the most memorable. Whether it's the dinner scene, the cat, Weaver kicking a** in her underwear, the reveal with Ash, or just the endless amount of beautiful establishing shots and production design, Alien is a masterpiece.+Tension+Scott's vision+The production design & effects+Birth of the Xenomorph10/10",10,2,4,16 May 2017
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," 'We'll not discriminate great from small'
","Do serial kills start singing after they murder their victims? Most likely not, but Sweeney Todd tackles that very premise as Tim Burton directs his bloodiest film to date.When musicals are done right, I'll be one of the first in line to see them. Much like Westerns, they are rare to come by these days so I'm always down to go back and check out one that I hadn't previously seen. Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street was one of those musicals, but sadly I don't think it lived up to the hype for me.To have a cohesive character arc, you need obstacles or just something significant a character goes through so that the ending feels justified and earned. In my opinion, there is no real character arc for Todd. Sure, he begins as a normal man starting a life with his wife and daughter, but this is done in a brief flashback. I never once felt attached to this character or really cared at all. The wrongs that were done to him and his family are bad, but again, it wasn't like we see a lot of this on screen, we are told about it. For as much bad as we see Todd do, it just would have been nice to have some material balance it out the other way.As for the musical aspects go, it's pretty paint by numbers. Perhaps, if I were into the story a little bit more and cared about what the characters were doing, I would have gotten into the songs they were singing. I really tried, but I just couldn't. It's also worth noting that because this film does have a fair amount of dialogue as well, the transitions to song weren't as smooth as they could have been. I love me some Alan Rickman, but when he breaks out into song at the barbershop, it feels pretty dang awkward.I'm in the minority here though, this musical is beloved by many people, and at first glance it seems like Burton did a nice job of adapting the musical to screen. So perhaps it's just me. I just feel that in order to make a good film about someone who says 'we'll not discriminate who we kill', I have to believe that what he or she is doing is warranted, and I didn't. Of course, these aren't just regular murders. These are bloody and premeditated murders in which the victims get baked into pies and fed to the town. Brutal. Just brutal.+Burton was the right man for the job-Never felt connected to the story or characters-Pretty gratuitous if you ask me-Song transitions are rough4.5/10",4,1,1,30 September 2016
Black Mass," Strictly Criminal
","Everyone knew Johnny Depp had talent, but it had been so long since we had a great performance from him, that I think we all started to wonder if he was ever going to return to form. Well, I think Black Mass can put that to rest. Not only is Depp stellar, but the film is actually really well done. I was really impressed by the entire production of the film and it was such a relief to see that the film was well done after months of hoping.Even though James 'Whitey' Bulger is a real life person, I wasn't too familiar with the story behind his days in South Boston. I had seen what Jack Nicholson had done with his character in The Departed, which is supposedly based on Bulger, but not much else. Depp gives Bulger a less comedic and far more chilling side to him than Nicholson did. I think the more surprising part of the film was the performance of Joel Edgerton as the FBI accomplice, John Connolly, and partner in crime so to speak to Bulger for so many years. That was the part of the story that really grabbed me more than anything else. The relationship of Connolly and Bulger and just how manipulative the one side was to the other. But also that Connolly looked up to Bulger and got caught up in the lifestyle of getting promotions and going to high profile parties that he lost site of what the mission was. But also, that Bulger wasn't portrayed as an all out monster. I like that we get to see that he was a loving father and even family man. He did some awful things but we can't forget the part that some of the FBI played in allowing things to happen the way they did.The rest of the cast also deserves high praise. It was one of the best ensemble pieces this year. Heck, even Dakota Johnson was terrific in her small but pivotal role. But Scott Cooper, the director, may have been the hero here. The tension and pacing rivaled some of Scorsese's best mob films. I won't be surprised if the film is nominated at the Oscars and Depp is nominated as well. It was a really well done quote on quote biopic. Or at least as close as we will get to knowing what the streets of 'Southie' were like.

Underworld Awakening," Doubles Down
","Upping the scale doesn't always mean a better film. 'Awakening' finds Underworld at its bloodiest and perhaps most action packed, but there's once again little under the surface of a vampire-action flick.At this point in the franchise, you pretty much know what you're going to get. Selene leads the war against anyone who opposes their kind. This time, however, it's humans who are on the opposite end of the stick. This premise felt a lot like when the old Planet of the Apes franchise ran out of ideas so they made a time jump and brought the humans in as the antagonists. In fact, it touches on a lot of the same social issues that 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' did, experimentation on creatures for one. The problem is, it's only touched upon. Just like the new relationship Selene has with a young girl named Eve isn't totally the focus either.I mean, I guess we can give 'Awakening' a little credit for not continuing the bland romance between Michael & Selene, and giving her someone new to care about. But there's a way to write characters into the story without overwhelming each scene with blood and guts. Heck, it's also pretty hard to root for Selene considering she slaughters every human in sight. This film absolutely doubles down on the series' heavy genre aspects, instead of trying to usher in a broader audience.Theo James & Charles Dance are brought in to essentially replace roles taken by Bill Nighy and Scott Speedman. Both actors give more grounded turns than the others did, but even they can't turn awful dialogue into something worth caring about. I'm not so sure Daniel Day-Lewis could even do it. Although the dialogue is still horrendous, the characters are still shallow, and the plot continues to get more ridiculously contrived, these films can be entertaining. The action is better choreographed than any of the other films and at least the run-time is short, right?+Action is amped up+Performances are more grounded-More blood & guts doesn't always mean the quality rises-Characters are still hollow5.3/10",5,1,3,18 January 2017
Suicide Squad," Worst Heroes Ever
","After the whirlwind that was Batman v Superman, DC needed a hit to restore faith in their product going forward. While Suicide Squad is far from the darling that I think fans were hoping for, it's also far from the disaster some predicted.Although I'm not the Zack Snyder hater that a lot of people are, I welcomed a change of pace in directing in the choice of David Ayer. His style didn't overpower the action or story like some of Snyder's choices do, but I also don't think he made a particularly fond impression on me either. Suicide Squad is an ensemble piece at its core, and I loved the way Ayer directed each and every one of these actors, but he allowed the plot around them to meander a little bit too much.Speaking of the wonderful cast, pretty much everyone came to play. Of course, there were expectedly great performances from Margot Robbie and Will Smith as Harley Quinn and Deadshot respectively, but supporting performances by Jai Courtney and Viola Davis nearly stole the show. Courtney, who's never sold me in any role, ended up being a nice comedic foil for the team. Davis' turn as the uncompromising Amanda Waller is just about as picture perfect casting as you can get.As for those aforementioned performances from Robbie and Smith, who already starred in a film together, they carry the bulk of the character depth from Ayer's script. Though the fear of Smith's ego taking over the majority of the screen time seemed legit; make no mistake, he proved to me he's still a huge movie star who can lead a film based on his charisma alone, even if he is a hit-man. Robbie on the other-hand, does her best at trying to make the case for a Harley Quinn led Birds of Prey film or even a prominent role in the upcoming Batman solo film. Either way, I want to see more of these characters.Sadly, its characters are the single most (and perhaps the only truly) compelling thing about Suicide Squad. Ayer gets off to an exciting start by seamlessly introducing all of the 'worst heroes ever' in the first 30 minutes, but the film's plot becomes less interesting as it progresses. There's no question Ayer creates a more fun world than what was set up in BvS, but the execution was just as messy. With that said, the humor is much more earned in Squad, and it hits way more than not.With all the good, there's always some bad. With Suicide Squad, they completely botched the villain. The trailers didn't give much away at all in terms of the villain, besides the Joker, so I won't go into detail, but it was poorly handled. The villain reveal is nothing special, and we once again aren't really given any details on the villain's motivations at all. It's a common mistake some comic book films make, and Suicide Squad was no different.I guess I have to at least address Jared Leto's version of Joker. I have to admit, I'm actually not totally sure how I feel yet. He's completely different from Ledger's iconic turn in 2008, but he also doesn't really have enough screen time for me to form an opinion on him just yet. So for now, I want to see more of him.As a whole, Suicide Squad is a fun time at the movies, but it's nowhere near the film I wanted it to be. Besides the cast, it doesn't have a whole lot going for it. There's a bit too much meandering in storytelling along with a disappointingly botched villain.

Taxi Driver," Way Ahead of its TIme
","Upon revisiting this film for a college course I realized a few things; One being that Robert De Niro may have never given a better performance than Travis Bickle, two being that this film was way more ahead of its time than many 70's noir thrillers, and three being Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors of all time. Sure all things many people knew already, but for some reason didn't resonate with me the first time.Taxi Driver tells the unfortunate story of Travis Bickle, an ex- marine just returning from his time in Vietnam who struggles to cope with paranoid psychosis in 1970's New York. Beginning and ending with trippy colors and stylish music from Bernard Hermann, Taxi Driver gets under your skin only when it wants to and in the most in opportune times. It succeeds in giving you the uncomfortable feeling and anguish most associated with noir and it does so in fashion.Bickle's skepticism and cynical view of New York City is perfectly portrayed by De Niro as we root for him the entire length of the movie. All of this tends to get him into trouble, but we don't care, because we are so sucked into Bickle's every move and every word that we don't tend to notice just how insane he has become. Of course, the film is iconic for its famous 'You talking to me?' line and its brutally violent climax, but its Scorsese's direction of De Niro's performance I will remember most.With this film comes plenty of questions as to whether or not any of it is actually real or not, which in most cases is valid. But I don't really care one way or another. No matter what, this is a tragic tale of a man lost in a world that he doesn't understand and a world that doesn't understand him. Whether or not the engaging narration is misleading is up to interpretation, but I just know that it's a wonderfully intricate story of a troubled Taxi Driver. If De Niro's encapsulating performance isn't enough for you than perhaps Scorsese's brilliant direction and Bernard Hermann's hauntingly beautiful and stylish score will be. Taxi Driver is a masterpiece.+De Niro is an all-time best+Scorsese's meticulous direction+Engaging in an unfortunately tragic way+Score+Noir way ahead of its time9.5/10",9,1,2,7 March 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Best Marvel Solo Film (Cap is B.A)
","This is exactly how Captain America should be portrayed. A complete bad-a** is what he is in this movie. This is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with my opinion one of its non-interesting characters. I say that but really after watching this movie, he is in my top 3 favorite Marvel characters now. Chris Evans is brilliant in this role, hats off to him. I sure hope he keeps playing Cap even after his current contract is up. The man brought a great amount of charisma to screen that I didn't see in the first Captain America movie. The same goes for Scarlett Johansson, who formed a great new team up in this movie with Cap, another team up/duo in Cap 3 perhaps? This film will grip you from the beginning to end, as it is as much a political thriller as it is an action-spy thriller.There is so much to like in this movie I don't know how to fit it all in one review. Ill start with the actors. Chris Evans as I said is perfect for Cap and so is Scarlett Johansson for Black Widow. I liked her small role in Iron Man 2 and she was great in a tad bigger role in Avengers. But she shows everything off in this movie. She brings so much to like with the sexiness and totally sells me on the kick-butt aspect. She has some of the best stunts of the movie and she makes it totally believable its her. Sebastian Stan returns in an actually smaller role than expected but no less important. He is truly terrifying as The Winter Soldier. And I can say that he is easily the best villain Marvel's Cinematic Universe has to offer, besides Loki of course. Sam Jackson is always great and I thought Redford pulled off the villain quite well. The newcomer Anothony Mackie was hilarious and his dynamic with Cap is as good if not better than the Stark-Rhodey banters. The action is beautifully shot and choreographed. Probably the best action in a superhero movie i've seen, and most believable. I also liked the callbacks to the first movie and the amount of name-drops to the other Avengers.The only complaints I have are that I wanted MORE Cap. There's a part of the movie that actually limits Cap's screen time and gets away for a bit, but of course comes back. There were parts near the end that did feel a little bit cheesy, but that's all. I also wonder what does the destruction of Shield mean for the Agents of Shield T.V. show? BTW...Did anybody really think Nick Fury would die? I would be wrong not to mention the directors. These guys came from doing just television shows, and now this huge movie? Talk about change of scope! I can trust them with any big time blockbuster now. Matter of fact, send them over to DC and get their movies going! And if they directed that first after credits scene props to them. That was quite the tease of the twins that will return in Age of Ultron. SCARLET WITCH! BRING JOE AND ANTHONY RUSSO BACK FOR CAP 3.Overall, there are too many good things about this movie to count, nearly perfect. Almost as good as the Avengers and really puts the Marvel Cinematic Universe in a new place (good place I may add) for upcoming movies.10/10",10,3,6,3 April 2014
Doctor Strange," The Most Ambitious Yet Uninspired Marvel Film Yet
","Marvel has gained my (and millions of other people's) trust through 14 films in their illustrious Cinematic Universe. But it's that trust I felt was tampered with in Doctor Strange, which is their most ambitious yet disappointingly uninspired film at the same time. Doctor Strange is helmed by horror director Scott Derrickson, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelson, and Tilda Swinton. Most of them are quite good in this stylish Marvel superhero flick, but I also don't believe any of them are given much to do. Cumberbatch plays a good a-hole, but we already have a better version of that in Tony Stark. McAdams was a strong point and provides the audience's connection to humanity, but there isn't much to her character yet, other than a love interest for Strange. Wong played the humor well. Mikkelson is one of the most dynamic actors working today, but I found nothing compelling or unique about his antagonist, Kaecilius. Nor did I think there was any believable motivation behind his actions. Tilda Swinton is probably the best part about the film, but again, she's used sparingly.I came into Doctor Strange wanting something entirely different than Marvel, or any other studio, has ever given us with a comic-book film. While there's something to be said about the trippy and horror-ish visuals this film displays, it actually ends up falling more victim to the superhero formula than I would have hoped. Take the humor for example, something Marvel has grown accustomed to trickling into their installments, but 80 % of the humor in Doctor Strange feels out of place. The trailers never once tried to sell me on humor. I came for a distinctly different story and mind-blowing visuals. I didn't buy my ticket to see Cumberbatch try and be the next Tony Stark. It would also help if the rest of the characters were using that same humor, but they aren't, most of them seem like they acted in a relatively serious drama. This type of humor works in Guardians or Ant-Man, but it's completely out of place in Doctor Strange.But it's far from all bad. Marvel at least deserves some credit for daring to actually take the fight sequences into that psychedelic territory. Granted, I wasn't as into the action scenes as I had wanted to be, because the story to that point wasn't all that interesting. If the film had stayed in the darker and twisted tone that some of those scenes presented, I could have been more on board with the end results. There are many strong aspects about this film, however. The visuals are unlike anything I have seen in a superhero film, Tilda Swinton kills it, McAdams is a strong love interest, and Strange himself deserves a place in the Marvel universe. But I was expecting something different. Perhaps that's on me, perhaps not, but this one just didn't do it for me.+The Ancient One+McAdams is a nice complement to Cumberbatch+Trippy and daring visuals+Unique fight scenes-But the story is paint by numbers-Mikkelsen gets nothing to do-Really really forced humor-Some third act decisions are questionable6.0/10",6,5,11,3 November 2016
Interstellar," Go Further
","Sometimes a film can be grand and epic in scale compared to others in one or a few categories. Interstellar manages to just about be the boldest in every single category of the filmmaking process. Christopher Nolan makes his most ambitious film yet and one of the most ambitious films I've ever seen. You can tell he was influenced by many of the great Sci-Fi classics including 2001: A Space Odyssey. But I think you can also seem glimpses of Sunshine, The Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and even Close Encounters of the Third Kind.It was my number 1 most anticipated film this year and it lived up to the hype. Of course it wasn't at all what I really expected considering Nolan hid so much from us, which is amazing for the year we live in. You know when you sit down at a Nolan film you will be both entertained and educated.The film itself is very complex and has a lot going on. I waited until I had seen the movie 3 times before even writing this review. After my first watch I didn't really know what to do with myself. I walked out of the Navy Pier IMAX 70mm film theater and was just in awe of what I just saw. I appreciate how much thought Nolan puts into his projects and the fact that he expects us to actually pay attention and it's not just some mindless blockbuster. I have now seen this film 3 times in 24 hours and I'm still not completely sure I understand everything Nolan was going for. To me the film is about hope. It's an optimistic view on the world and how we need to go back to our roots and go further than what we think we have settled for. I like his use of baseball in the film as a parallel for our pastime. Baseball is America's pastime and our roots. Perhaps it was on purpose perhaps not.The performances are phenomenal. Led by Matthew McConaughey, who gives a gut wrenching performance. I won't go through how great everyone was, but Jessica Chastain also stood out. I think she has a shot at a best supporting actress nod, whereas McConaughey is in a much more packed group. The father daughter relationship was beautiful and definitely fulfilling. It takes a bit of time to finally go on the mission but once they do, it never slows down. The cinematography was gorgeous, especially while going through the wormholes. Seeing it IMAX was stunning and proved Nolan doesn't necessarily need Wally Pfister to give us great looking films. Compliment that with Hans Zimmer's beautiful score and you already have yourself a thrilling experience. I love that Zimmer didn't push 'Braaaam' type score like he has been accused of overusing at times. The main theme is just beautiful and perfectly accommodates the film.There a few subtle moments that really got to me. One being when they realize they have been on the planet for 23 years and come back to find Romilly old and gray. The other being the chilling video message scenes. I can't praise McConaughey enough for how well those scenes were acted. I had a lot of trouble holding back the tears. It was just heartbreaking knowing how long his kids were waiting for him. Sure the decision to leave them is selfish but what would you do? If you're truly believing you're saving human kind wouldn't you at least exercise that option? The different worlds they visited were stunning and gave us some of the most intense scenes in the film. Matt Damon's 'cameo' was interesting and definitely longer than I thought. I knew he was in the film, but had no idea to what extent or who he was playing.The moment we realize Coop is trapped in the fifth dimension and he was the 'ghost behind the bookshelves' was heartbreaking. It was one of the many brilliantly acted scenes by McConaughey, and one that many people were quietly saying 'oh my god' to in the theater every time I went. To fully understand all the science and complications they have to go through on this journey was difficult. But I don't think that's the point. The point is optimism. That if we reach higher, break barriers, and go further perhaps we can save our world if we ever get to that point. I will say I wish they would have given us a broader view of our dying world so we feel like this mission really is our last chance. I also think the way they handled Coop leaving Murph in the final scene was underwhelming for how much it was built up, but these are minor complaints. I still can't wait to see what Nolan does next.It's one of the most amazing experiences I have had with a film, even though I don't even think it's one of Nolan's best. It was Nolan's grandest and by far most emotion and personal film. It had many of his signature moments but also had much more hope than all of his other films have. This film isn't perfect by any means but it has everybody talking. Isn't that what film is all about? I don't think giving it a 10 means it has no problems whatsoever, but I think it means it's a film that will stand the test of time and quite possibly is actually important to people and this world. Hopefully this film will inspire other filmmakers to go the extra mile.+McConaughey's heartbreaking performance +Chastain & Foy's Murph +Video message scenes +True cinematic IMAX experience +Most ambitious film I've ever seen +Depiction of other worlds/wormholes +Hans Zimmer's beautiful score +Influenced by many Sci-Fi classics +Entire cast & cameo performances +Optimistic -Final goodbye 10/10",10,2,7,9 November 2014
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," The Most Unpredictable Film of the Year
","It's not that I like watching depressing films, but there's a strange appeal I have in watching films where people go through seriously tragic and heart-wrenching events. I think it's more of an appeal to go through emotions that you don't normally feel type of thing. And really, that's what movies are for in my opinion, to get a specific emotion out of the audience. Three Billboards was one of the most effective films of the year in that regard. I felt every emotion the film was trying to convey, and to the film's credit, that was a widespread range of emotions.Classified as a dark comedy, Three Billboards is about a mother still grieving over her daughters rape and murder 7 months ago, so she decides to put up messages on billboards directed at the town's police department, and their lack of effort towards arresting the perpetrator. A powerful synopsis at that, but the film never takes itself too far in one particular direction in emotion. There are a few laugh out loud scenes but I was never taken out of the film with misplaced humor. There were plenty of dark themed sequences and discussions had throughout the film, but they were far from being emotionally manipulative. In that sense, this is easily one of the most well-balanced films of the year.Let's talk about the cast for a second, because it almost sounds too good to be true. Frances McDorman plays the mother of a murdered child who is cynical and suppresses her emotions. Woody Harrelson plays a hardened cop who is well-respected around town. And Sam Rockwell is the lazy and vile cop who constantly doesn't live up to the expectations set by his peers. Those three alone are perfect casting, and that's not even mentioning the supporting cast. Director Martin McDonagh did a wonderful job of bringing Oscar caliber performances out of the three of them. He also manages to direct the film in an unconventional and unpredictable way. Several times I was stunned by some of the decisions these characters made, but then after sitting down and thinking it through, it's exactly what those people would have done in those particular situations. When a film can surprise you while never letting that surprise be manipulative, that's the sign of a great director. If he's not nominated for best director, I will be very disappointed.As I said up top, I want to be emotionally moved by every film I see. Whether that be laughing, crying, or on the edge my seat with overwhelming enjoyment, that's all I can really ask of a film. As Jim Valvano once said, there are three things you should do every day: laugh, think, and cry, and Three Billboards managed to put me through those three things several times in under 2 hours. That's one heck of a movie.9.5/10",9,4,9,1 December 2017
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," 'Be With Me'
","I've always tried to review movies based on how successful they are at making me feel the particular emotions they are trying to pull out of you. Some would highly disagree with that notion, but I've always been consistent in believing that. And for me, The Rise of Skywalker succeeded on almost every level. I love this franchise and I love (for the most part) the first 2 movies in the new trilogy. How we got to this point in terms of behind the scenes issues or lack of planning on Disney's part ultimately doesn't matter, this movie is an absolute blast. Tons of fist pumping moments, surprises, and more than anything a satisfying ending to a 9 picture saga. A more full (spoiler) review can be found via my podcast, but that's all that needs to be said at the moment. Decide for yourself if you like it or not.9.7/10",9,8,23,30 December 2019
American Sniper," Keep Both Eyes Open
","Bradley Cooper is simply one of the elite actors working today. He has now been nominated for 3 acting Oscars. It's debatable whether or not he was better than other actors this year, I will judge that once I have seen all the films, but he is definitely Oscar worthy in American Sniper. But he's not the only great thing about this film. Clint Eastwood does a great job directing and the editing and special effects are top notch. It's one of the most intense films I have seen this year and so I have no problem with some of the nominations this movie received.It's really just an incredible story. At times the film can be heartbreaking. Almost half of my theater walked out weeping. I didn't cry, but man was this a tough one to watch. The fact that all of this (presumably) actually happened just makes it that much more difficult. One of the key scenes from the trailer begins the film and it sets the tone for just how intense it will be. Eastwood didn't really hold back on the brutality of killing over a hundred people, and the aftermath of what it does to a person. I initially thought the back and forth between the tours and his family life would take away from the experience but it really didn't. Sienna Miller did a very good job of giving us that emotion without overdoing it.Bradley Cooper bulked up and also brought the emotional gravitas it takes to lead this type of film. Chris Kyle gets literally lost in fighting this war that he doesn't realize how much this is negatively impacting his family and Cooper perfectly portrayed that. I also don't know if I have seen PTSD better displayed than it was here. Of course I wouldn't actually know how that feels but I do know that the subtly with which Cooper portrayed it was very effective. They also didn't make this person out to be too much of a hero. I appreciate that they didn't take killing this many people lightly.I also agree with the way Eastwood decided to end the film. Without spoilers I don't think there's any other way you could have served the film and it's real life characters better. American Sniper is a difficult film to watch, but it's one of the better ones this year.+Cooper's multidimensional performance +Story structure +Eastwood's directing +Doesn't hold back with the top notch editing8.4/10",8,154,283,16 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," I Love My Job...I Love My Job...
","In what is essentially Anne Hathaway's spiritual follow up to Princess Diaries, she finds herself pitted against Meryl Streep in a fashion drama, with a very similar arc to that of the aforementioned Princess Diaries.It mostly holds up in concept but admittedly it's very inside baseball at times, especially as Meryl is spouting out fashion terms and demands that fall on deaf ears to me. Alas, Hathaway is charming, Emily Blunt is hilariously and admirably devoted to Meryl, and Streep is..well we already know she's fantastic.7.0/10",7,0,0,10 February 2019
Corpse Bride," Far More Dead than Alive
","Coming in at a mere 77 minutes, Corpse Bride is a short-little-fun adventure, even though there could have clearly been some more room for character development.One of the things I love most about Tim Burton's films is the promise of an epic adventure. Corpse Bride is a far more contained story than his previous effort, Big Fish, but it does have some adventurous moments. In fact, it's kind of like a cross between Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice. But to me, there was just something missing.The voice talent is strong here with frequent Burton collaborators Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter tackling the groom and the 'corpse bride' respectively. But I didn't find either character to be all that compelling. Victor Van Dort (Depp) is a shy groom with a lack of confidence, and he doesn't have the charisma to get me to root hard for him. On the other-hand, the corpse bride has an intriguingly tragic backstory, but also falls victim to bland dialogue. To me, the most interesting characters are the ones in the background who come and go with eccentric scenery.A film is only as good as its leads, and although it's impressively animated by Laika, the characters end up taking second fiddle to a Gothic underbelly of strange characters feasting on the inexperience of the bride and the groom. I like the attempt of Burton and crew, and there certainly is some joy to be had here, but the execution just isn't there. Style over substance. To put it bluntly, the film itself is more dead than it is alive.+Eccentric side characters-Imaginative but lacks thought out characters-Incomplete execution5.3/10",5,0,1,20 September 2016
Lion," A Journey Worth Taking
","Lion isn't the most tightly directed film, nor the most emotionally impactful. But it's one of the most unique films I've seen this year. So much like Captain Fantastic, I really like the film as a whole, but I appreciate the film's originality even more.I always love sitting down for a film that's structured entirely different than your prototypical movie thrown in theaters every weekend. I love blockbusters as much as the next guy, but there's something to be said about smaller and more independently made features. Lion is based on a true story about an adopted boy, Saroo, who uses google earth to try and find his original family from India. As happens sometimes with true stories adapted into feature length films, it's difficult to structure a 2 hour story from events that took place over the course of several years. Lion begins when Saroo is only five years old, and spans over 20 years. To say this was a difficult story to adapt is an understatement, and I think this is the only area where the film really has some faults. After spending significant screen time with a young Saroo, you are asked to then follow a late 20's Saroo, played by Dev Patel, and it's not the smoothest of transitions. Granted, I got over it after a few scenes, but the very nature of this story makes it difficult to keep the flow even throughout.Patel, along with his young counterpart, Sunny Pawar, are terrific. As a first time actor, Pawar, had to take on an entire first act by himself, and you'd think he'd been doing this for years already. It's unlikely he'll come close to winning, but he should be considered for best supporting actor. You can't find that much charisma at that age easily.When Lion hits emotionally, it really hits. I think it's the time in between that takes the overall quality of the film down a notch. Some sporadic pacing and a story that calls for a wandering plot makes for a mediocre experience. But when the film chooses to sink your teeth into an extremely engrossing journey into what it feels like to be lost, it contains some of the most emotionally impactful sequences. The last shot says it all. I just wish it wasn't so few and far between.+Some heavy, heavy stuff here+Pawar is a young star+A Journey worth taking-Pacing-Story sometimes strays away from where it should stay7.8/10",7,1,3,2 January 2017
Gone Baby Gone," Thought provoking, Casey Affleck's best performance
","I recommend the film 'Gone Baby Gone'. I have seen around a thousand movies and over a hundred crime movies. In my opinion this is the best crime movie I have ever seen. Ironically it was only the first directed movie by Ben Affleck. Usually a first time director has trouble creating a great film as a whole, as he/she deals with the immense responsibility that comes with directing a feature length film. The movie revolves around two Boston detectives and partners in life that come across a nearby kidnapping and are hired to ask around the neighborhood to find out as much as they can for the family of the kidnapped girl. The movie is based off a series of Dennis Lehane novels about the two detectives, all taking place in Boston. This movie was made off a relatively small budget but it involved some of the biggest actors in Hollywood. Affleck got his younger brother Casey Affleck to star, along with Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris, Michelle Monaghan, and Amy Ryan to round out the stellar cast. It wasn't made to be a typical blockbuster so I think it isn't known to the community as much as 'Argo' is, Ben Affleck's most recent directorial effort. Even without making a lot of money it garnered critical acclaim and currently holds a 94% approval rating on rotten tomatoes. I think this film is vital for anyone who is or is planning on being involved with law enforcement. Even though the main characters aren't exactly the most prestigious detectives, they bring humanity to the film and it really forces you to become invested in the characters even at the darkest of times. And it is a very dark film, it introduces many themes that aren't for everyone's viewing. That being said there are several scenes in the movie that standout. One scene between Ed Harris and Casey Affleck's character is compelling because both of them are detectives but also stand on opposite sides of an argument. Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) had just killed someone because he found a dead child in their house, while helping Remy Bressant (Harris) try to bust this household of another kidnapping. Kenzie is second guessing and having regrets about what he just did, while Bressant stands firmly on the side of murder being right depending on who you do it to. Both men had been drinking so their judgment was impaired. The reason this scene is so interesting is that both these men believe in taking down the bad guys, but at the same time don't agree on how to do it. The dialogue in this film is worlds above a normal movie. I think some of the values that we can take away from this particular scene is that we will never all agree on everything, but if we learn how to better deal with these issues maybe it can help resolve them. This film deals with many moral dilemmas that are still relevant in the world we live in now. The ending scene is also one of the more debated issues I have come across. And an issue that I myself that gone back and forth with several times. Without spoiling anything, the ending is a decision between nature vs nurture, and what is really best for a child who grows up without parents who truly care about them. Affleck gives a voice-over in a few parts of the film as a reminder that this is what the film is really diving into. He constantly brings up that he believes it's the things we don't choose that make us who we are, which would make us assume he believes in nature. But also in the film there are clearly decisions that are made that oppose that argument. Kenzie and his partner are faced with decisions that actually define their relationship, which suggests nurture. That's why this movie is so powerful, it doesn't give you the black and white answer, it lets you decide for yourself what you think is right while also giving good evidence for both sides. Luckily, I have never had to deal with a kidnapping so I can't speak from experience, but it is one of the more thought provoking movies I have seen. It has taught me several things for life but the main lesson being, don't hold back from believing in what you want to, but also taking into account that there isn't always one right answer. I really do hope that more people can see this movie because of the impact it had on me. I can't recommend this movie enough, it is always the first movie I suggest when friends ask for a movie recommendation. The themes from this movie will stick with me for a long time. Overall 'Gone Baby Gone' is a heart pumping experience that anyone involved or interesting in crime should watch.",10,0,1,20 February 2014
The Lost City of Z," Where No Man Has Gone Before
","It's very rare in 2017 Hollywood that we get an epic like The Lost City of Z. Albeit noticeably flawed in many aspects, this film hearkens back to the days where exploration epics were a normalcy in the filmmaking world. The strengths of The Lost City of Z lie with its unique journey the protagonist takes, and not necessarily with the protagonist or the film itself. What I mean by that is that I think the actual story the film is based on is more interesting than how the film portrays it. Sometimes biopics that span a great length of time are difficult to effectively portray on the big screen. Because 'Z' takes place over the course of roughly 20 years, it becomes increasingly tough to grapple onto something worth enjoying. Every time one of his explorations seems to get interesting, we get interrupted by his abrupt return to civilization and more family drama. Whether or not that's how the true story of Percy Fawcett went is irrelevant. Sometimes it takes some tweaking to make for an entertaining feature length film.Charlie Hunnam plays Fawcett, an explorer who seeks glory in finding a mysterious city of people which has 'never been touched by a white man'. Fawcett himself is an interesting character, especially when the film dives into his own psychology and obsession over 'Z'. He's a lot like Matthew McConaughey's character from Interstellar, always searching for something nobody has seen before even if means leaving his family for years at a time. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why Fawcett isn't very likable. We constantly see him leave his family even though, with the exception of war, he has a choice in the matter.There is something to admire about someone, or in this case multiple people, who keep searching for the dreams no matter the cost. Fawcett, along with a few consistent compadres, go on dangerous expeditions through the jungle to find what they think is a real lost city. The aspects of the film I enjoy the most are watching men go through hardships in search of something they truly care about. In this regard, the film is a fascinating exploration physically and mentally.Aside from Hunnam, there are a few great performances from Sienna Miller as Nina Fawcett, Robert Pattinson as Henry Costin, and Tom Holland as Jack Fawcett. All elevating each scene they are in and making the journey worth it for sure. There's a lot this film does well, including making a lasting impact on viewers minds in terms of exploration, but the writing can be a little bit more polished with certain changes made to fit a movie and not just serve the story properly. There's a happy medium there that I think could have benefited the final product.+The Story+Brings back a lost genre-Uncharismatic characters-Uneven script6.7/10",6,51,77,29 April 2017
Southpaw," Gut-Punching
","This may be a controversial statement, but I don't know that anyone besides perhaps Daniel Day-Lewis commits to his roles more than Jake Gyllenhaal does. Year after year, and Oscar caliber performance after Oscar caliber performance, this man surprises me. Not only is Gyllenhaal incredibly dedicated, but he disappears into his roles, and as a famous A-list actor, that's pretty difficult to do. Southpaw is a good movie, but Gyllenhaal is phenomenal. It almost seemed like he was acting in a classic, but the film itself was just another solid sports picture. Don't get me wrong, this film has plenty of great performances, but sometimes everything doesn't quite come together. But considering just how good Gyllenhaal is, that's alright.Southpaw tells the story of Billy Hope, an undefeated boxing champion who suffers a life shattering tragedy and is forced to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and reform his career following this event. If you haven't watched any of the trailers, don't. There's a huge spoiler/plot point that they show and it's entirely unnecessary. But even though I had seen both the trailers, I found the film to be just as captivating. Rachel McAdams doesn't have a huge role, but she's very effective as Hope's wife and backbone to everything he does. She's been good in True Detective this year, but I don't think she has ever been better than she was in her few scenes in Southpaw. It doesn't hurt that Gyllenhaal plays wells off of her and so does the daughter, played by Oona Laurence, for that matter. The entire family dynamic was really well handled and probably my favorite part about the movie. In fact, this isn't as much of a boxing film as it is a father-daughter story. Sure, it has a certain amount of a redemption involved in Hope's strive to get back in the ring, but I found his willingness to save his relationship with his daughter to be the much more appealing side of the film.It's also worth noting how good Forest Whitaker is here as well. I think this film has about 20 tear jerking scenes but probably the best acted scenes involved him and Gyllenhaal. Both of them can do so much with just their facial expressions and particularly their eyes. There are few people in the business who can say entire paragraphs just by moving their eyes or face in a particular way. With all this being said, I think there are a few flaws with the film. There are several plot points that are brought up but then never addressed or resolved before the movie ends. I cant say much else without spoiling the film but I just thought the directing could have been more polished. There's also the lack of build up for the final fight. We spent a good chunk of the film dealing with family issues and Billy's inner demons, but then all of a sudden he's already prepared for a title fight. There were training sequences, sure, but the ending felt pretty rushed. Other than that, there isn't much to complain about with Southpaw. It's one of the best acted films so far this year, and of Jake Gyllenhaal's illustrious career. The directing could have been cleaned up but there's no denying how well the emotional gravitas of this film was handled. It's one of the better sports films of the last few years.+Gyllenhaal does it again +Music/soundtrack +McAdams' pivotal performance +Really, really, emotional -Ending felt rushed -Choppy directing 8.2/10",8,1,3,26 July 2015
Ant-Man," Small Hero, Bigger Universe
","Part of the brilliance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is how they are able to seamlessly weave the stories together and connect our heroes into one giant story. Ant-Man manages to bring Marvel's smallest hero to life and further the universe/galaxy into an even more thrilling place. I really enjoyed the film. I found it to be one of Marvel's funniest pictures, which is no surprise when you have Adam McKay and Paul Rudd co-writing the script. I thought the action and unique fight scenes were well done. There's a ton to like about Ant-Man, and it's another solid outing for the studio. But I also unfortunately think it's is one of the weaker films Marvel has done. That's not to say I don't think Ant-Man is a good film, I do. I think it's really good, but it's not great. Especially after the last 3 films Marvel had done were Avengers 2, Guardians, and Cap 2. Three near perfect superhero films in my book.Ant-Man tells the story of Scott Lang, an ex-con who just needs a second chance in order to prove to his daughter that he's worth something. That's the part of the film I really enjoyed. I like that this film is at it's core a father-daughter story. For both Scott and Hank, they are trying to prove to their daughters that they aren't washed up bums. Hank gives Scott a chance at redemption by training him to be the Ant-Man, in order to help save the world from Darren Cross' ugly ideas. Cross plays Yellowjacket, and the main villain of the film. The Yellowjacket scenes were pretty cool and much more entertaining than the trailers led me to believe, but I wasn't really a fan of Corey Stoll's performance as Cross. Perhaps it's because his character is way too similar to Jeff Bridges' character in the first Iron man, or maybe it's because the script just doesn't add depth to him. No matter, I thought that was one of the more glaring weaknesses, and a hero is only as good as it's villain. In terms of our hero, I loved Paul Rudd's performance. He's always been great at pulling off both drama and comedy, and Scott Lang was no different for him. I loved that it never seemed like he or the cast were taking the film too seriously, which is something Guardians also did really well. In these big superhero films, it's important to understand the scope and even the utter ridiculousness of the stories. I mean this film is called Ant-Man for crying out loud.If we're talking about Ant-Man's buddies, I'll admit I wasn't as grossed out as I thought I would be by all the ants in this film. And I was a little hurt when Scott's main buddy, Anthony, kicked the bucket, something I never thought I would say about an Ant. But I wasn't sold on Hope, as both a character and as Evangeline Lilly's performance. There was an opportunity for a great character here, and perhaps there still is in the future (after credits scene), but I never felt connected to her at any point. Her emotional scenes are carried by Michael Douglas, who was brilliant, and her sassy lines come off really b*tchy. Of course, they have to push her for a love interest to Scott, which always felt awkward, as the chemistry was just not there. But the fact that she's pretty much becoming the Wasp, makes me have hope for the character. but overall, if we're just talking about her in this role, I found her to be kind of off-putting and unlikable, but that's just me. Onto the comedy, Michael Pena absolutely kills it. He's by far the funniest part of the movie and quite possibly of the entire cinematic universe. It would be fun to see him interact with some of the Avengers. Most of Scott's buddies hit the mark with their comedy, and speaking of the Avengers, man was that Falcon scene awesome. I was spoiled with him being in the film by a stupid TV spot, but I was impressed to see him have such a notable role and it never felt out of place. It was also nice to briefly see John Slattery and Hayley Atwell reprise their MCU roles.So with Ant-Man being hilarious and imposing further implications on the universe, I was pleased with the outcome. It's not one of Marvel's better films and it has way too many plot conveniences and a few clichés here and there, but the film is still enjoyable. I just wish the film felt more special then it ended up feeling. The story is weird, but Guardians felt like nothing I have ever experienced. While the action is different then any Marvel film, I don't think the story built around it was all that special. It was also probably the most predictable of any Marvel film to date. Nevertheless, go see it, and stay for both credits scenes, because they are killer.+Douglas & Rudd kill it +Pena is hilarious +Falcon scene +Beginning cameos -Hope -Villain doesn't have much depth 7.7/10",7,4,12,16 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," Not a Perfect Solider, but a Good Man
","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Much like Iron Man 2, I wasn't a huge fan of The First Avenger the first time I watched this film years ago. But every single time I have watched it since, I have enjoyed it more and more. It has its cartoonish moments and an unmemorable performance from Hugo Weaving as Red Skull, but Chris Evans and Hayley Atwell bring so much charisma to the film that it's enough to outweigh some of the mishaps.Probably because we have been spoiled with how Joe and Anthony Russo have portrayed Captain America, but Joe Johnston doesn't get a ton of credit for his directing job. Granted, the film is uneven in tone at times and it has a certain amount of bombastic elements to its visuals, but The First Avenger is about as good of a job as you could do at introducing the man out of time.With the Avengers coming out merely a half a year after, the film had the task of giving a proper origin story to a man with morals structured around a completely different time period. It's the only true period piece Marvel has done as more than 90 percent of the film takes place in the 1940's as Cap receives super soldier serum in an attempt to counter Red Skull and Hydra's attacks.Red Skull felt much like every other Marvel villain, wasted. Weaving comes off as more cartoonish and James Bond-villain-like than the tone of the rest of the film. Even if that's who the character is in the comics, I think there were some changes that needed to be made. With that said, I really enjoy everything that's going on in the army, led by very solid performances from Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, and Hayley Atwell. Atwell is positioned as the love interest for Cap and it couldn't have been handled any better. Much like the film itself, their relationship in this film has grown on me over time.The First Avenger is an origin story through and through, but that doesn't stop it from having some cool action sequences both before and after Cap gets his suit. And of course, I have to mention the heroic score from Alan Silvestri. It was unfortunate that they didn't carry it over to The Winter Solider, but Henry Jackman ended up doing it justice. Overall, the most unique film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe was a solid way to introduce us to the undeniably likable Steve Rogers, even if it has plenty of faults both in front and behind the camera.+Cap & Peggy+Supporting performances+Silvestri's score+Evans' is so dang likable-Cartoonish Red Skull-Uneven directing7.6/10",7,0,0,4 May 2016
Incendies," Where Does Your Story Start?
","I was absolutely blown away by this film. It's one of those movies that sticks with you awhile after watching. I cant get this film out of my head. Not only is a beautiful looking film, the story is told in a beautiful way. Sure, it's a story that takes place during some of the middle east conflicts, but that's not what you will remember from Incendies. You will remember the characters and the relationships or lack of relationships that each of them have. Denis Villenueve gave us yet another masterpiece here.The film deals with twins who are looking over their mother's will when they find she has given them each a mission before they are allowed to bury her. The mission is to find their brother, who they didn't know existed, and their father, who they assumed was dead. It's such a unique and interesting premise. Definitely one that keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. But what's great about Incendies and Villenueve's directing is that it doesn't rely on actual suspense like scenes to make you feel suspenseful. In other words, the film can be shocking but it doesn't rely on big shootouts or real life dangerous scenes. I just loved that the film was able to pull off vulnerability without cheapening the shock value. The film is told through two parallel stories. The mother, Nawal, in her younger days traveling through the middle east going from jail to jail. And her kids, looking for the brother and father through various people who knew Nawal back in the day. The first half of the film when the mother and daughter are both going on their journeys I felt was more interesting than the brother's arc, but they all turned out to be valuable in the end.I loved the subtle emotional acting that the children gave. Often, Villenueve would keep the camera on their faces for a long period of time while they hear something life changing. It proved to be a great technique in creating more emotion than the scene would have otherwise called for. Of course, this film is known to be shocking and have loads of twists and turns, but I never felt the film reached for too much shock value. Every twist seemed possible and something that actually could happen. And it's a tribute to the lead actors that they were able to ground the film in reality enough to never take me out of it. Incendies is one of those films that I put off seeing for awhile because I didn't think the story interested me enough, but I'm now jealous of anyone who hasn't seen it and will be able to experience it for the first time. It's a film that is both devastatingly beautiful and beautifully devastating. I absolutely loved this film.+Lead performances +Shocking twists and turns +Villenueve's directing style +Edge of your seat drama +Parallel storytelling 9.4/10",9,0,2,8 June 2015
The Bourne Ultimatum," He Remembers Everything
","All three of the original films work extremely well as one cohesive watch, as I've found out after watching them back to back to back, but 'Ultimatum' is the biggest and most explosive of the series.Paul Greengrass returned to direct the conclusion of the originally planned trilogy, as does Matt Damon in the title role. Greengrass added a much more human aspect to Bourne in 'Supremacy' all while adding just the right amount of action. I feel like there was a bit more of an imbalance in 'Ultimatum'. Certainly, the car chases and the breathtaking rooftop chase are great, but there are a few too many leaps of faith the audience has to take in terms of logic. Especially considering how grounded the first two films are.Even with the logic issues, The Bourne Ultimatum may be the most entertaining and heart stopping film of the entire series, with one thrilling scene after another. The aforementioned rooftop sequence in Tangier is one thing, but one of the opening scenes takes place in a London terminal, and it may be my favorite scene of the film altogether. It's usually not the high octane chases or visceral gun battles that get me, but the scenes in which Bourne is using his slick wit and experience to one-up those against him.Among the cast returning is Joan Allen as Pamela Landy. Although you can make the case her story ended with Bourne in 'Supremacy', the direction they take her arc in helping Bourne tear through his past made sense here. Opposing Landy is Deputy Director Noah Vosen, played by David Straithairn. Straithairn is very good at playing characters that get under your skin with frustrating decisions and Vosen is exactly that. So although I preferred Chris Cooper and Brian Cox in those roles, Straithairn is a solid counterpart to Damon. It's all the more impressive considering the very little screen time, if any, that the antagonists end up having with Bourne.Though it is now 2016 and there's a new Jason Bourne film coming out, watching The Bourne Ultimatum made me realize that there really never needed to be another entry in the series. The film comes full circle and Bourne's search for answers got to the point I hoped for. The end really feels like the end, so I sure hope the new film reinvents itself and doesn't retread the same story beats because Ultimatum certainly does.'Ultimatum' has its detractors and I can see a few of the complaints being warranted, but there's no denying the epic scope and thrill ride the film takes you on. It's the most cinematic of the bunch and the characters don't really take a backseat to action. I only hope there aren't as many leaps of logic next time around.+Scope+Rooftop and terminal sequence+Feels like the end+Landy & Bourne-Leaps of faith in logic9.3/10",9,1,2,28 July 2016
Fargo," Twisted story with unlikable characters
","The Coen brothers consistently give us great cinema. And they give us movies that aren't just good, but memorable. While this film isn't their best, it definitely comes off as disturbing and memorable. Even though the opening credits state that all events in the film actually took place, the entire film's plot is fictional. Which works well in the Coen bros favor. Making us get more invested in characters and events that took place.The Coen bros greatest strength has always come from their script, and this film is no exception. The writing and directing work perfectly together. Even without any huge actors, each of them give good performances, although I don't know about the idea of Midwesterners being this weird. I realize the Coens grew up in Minnesota so they have first hand experience but the accents were kind of overdone, and at times made the characters come off as stupid. With that being said I really enjoyed what Frances McDormand did with her character. She comes off as really the only likable character in the entire movie. And truly deserved the Oscar she received. William H. Macy was good as well but near the end I wanted to punch him in the face.I wonder what the T.V series will be like. If they go the route of remake I don't think it will work, but if you just say it's within the same world the Coen bros created, then I think it works great. I am glad to hear the Coens are at least producing. Maybe have the series take place in Fargo this time? Back to the film, I think it's a re-watchable film because of the dark humor and impeccable writing, even with the sudden violence. I wouldn't put the movie in my top 5 Coen bros movies but it was significant in helping them reach the top of directing and writing in film.7.7/10",7,0,0,14 April 2014
Predator," Mindless Entertainment
","This film has no depth. In fact there isn't any depth to virtually any of the characters. Sure it has great effects for it's time but besides thousands of bullets being shot everywhere, the characters don't have much to them. I understand that this predator concept is cool, and possibly before it's time. But the execution is lazy and just another throw away Schwarzenegger film.I enjoy Schwarzenegger in basically everything he does, because of the incredible amount of charisma he brings to the screen. And its because of his last 25 minutes with the Predator that this movie even gets a 4. To me the film is unwatchable with the other characters on screen. Not only are they cliché, but none of them even seem real. You can tell each of them are just acting, even Carl Weathers.Once again with these monster/alien movies, you have to wait until basically the half way point to even see the Alien. I know that it's suppose to build up the suspense but look at the Dark Knight for example. The Joker is on screen before Batman or Bruce Wayne is. In my opinion you get us all thrilled in one of the opening scenes with the bad guy, show us his skills, and then throughout the whole movie we are wondering what the next thing he/she will do. That way the build up doesn't beat the reward. The Predator looks stupid, and it's easily a man with a mask. So I don't think this is an all time Sci-Fi classic, but at least some entertainment can be found with Arnold in the last 20 minutes or so.+end +Every Arnold scene -Lazy characters, no depth -stop trying to build up the Alien/Monster reveal -Predator is just a man in a suit with a mask 4.9/10",4,4,14,7 June 2014
Notting Hill," Indefinitely
","I would imagine it's many people's dream to meet a movie star and fall in love over the course of one day & Notting Hill plays this very premise out with major success. Over 20 years old and just as charming as I assume this movie was praised for all those years ago. Julia Roberts effortlessly plays movie star Anna Scott (who may or may not be just a representation of who she truly is in real life) and Hugh Grant plays Will Thacker, just a bookshop owner who happens to meet Anna on a fateful day in Notting Hill. Just as I always say with Tom Cruise, Julia Roberts is one of those once in a lifetime movie stars, and someone who's always giving 100% effort even when it isn't needed. I think the 'they don't make movies like this anymore' is overdone, but it's undeniably true here.9.0/10",9,0,0,8 May 2020
Nightcrawler," Completely Mesmerizing, Gyllenhaal Get's Lost In This Role
","WOW. I had heard basically all great things from the reviews of this film going in so I was pretty confident it was going to be good, but had no idea how good. Jake Gyllenhall once again gives an Oscar worthy performance as a crime journalist who gets caught up in 'his business' and pushes the limits of what is morally right. I haven't seen all the performances so far but I cant see Gyllenhaal not getting nominated. It's not even him in the role, it's Louis Bloom. Not once do you even really think that it's Jake Gyllenhaal, and there aren't many actors who can do that.What's perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that it's Dan Gilroy's directorial debut. Every shot and scene perfectly flows and the finale is stunning. This film truly kept me on the edge of my seat. The limits that Bloom goes in this film to protect his business and for financial benefit is insane. What's really scary is that he's not phased by the most ridiculous things that happen to him. I actually found myself rooting for this borderline psychopath throughout most of the movie. That's when you know a film is actually making your brain function. This movie is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time. It's drawing comparisons to Drive, which is fair. But it's also less artistically driven and meant more as a brain twister. This film also has one of the most intense finales of any movie this year, that's great directing.Bloom basically becomes obsessed with his job and building himself as the top 'video news journalist' and it completely encompasses him. He starts taking things too far, as you may have thought. And really Bloom is basically the antagonist to his own protagonist. It's worth noting how much insight this film gives into this world and how people potentially get video on crime scenes. It's actually quite scary to think that real life people are doing things very similar to what Bloom does. I really cant recommend this film more. It's a great psychological thriller with a great lead performance. Expect this one to get a lot of buzz come February 22nd.+Gyllenhaal? Nope it was just Bloom +Beautifully shot +Mesmerizing story +I'm rooting for antagonist/protagonist +Gripping finale +Thought provoking 9.8/10",9,2,6,31 October 2014
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Satirical Look at Our Celebrity Obsessed Culture
","The mockumentary style of filmmaking can be a divisive one. You have to balance the tone well enough for viewers to believe in the story you're trying to tell while also giving enough laughs to please the fans of the genre. Even if Popstar didn't produce as many big laughs as I would have hoped, I can appreciate the attempt to change the structure to typical filmmaking.Starring the trio from The Lonely Island and pretty much every other comedian and/or celebrity, Popstar has a tendency to rely too heavily on surprise cameos and over-the-top gags. That's not to say I didn't think the main cast had their moments, they did. But the biggest laughs came from surprise appearances from people I didn't know were in the film.The overabundance of celebrities make me curious as to why virtually no one showed up to the theatre to see the film. It's also not like they didn't properly market the film. The trailers show exactly what you're going to get; a raunchy comedy told with in the mockumentary style about a dysfunctional lead singer who struggles to regain fame, with plenty of cameos mixed in. Perhaps there just isn't the audience for this type of story.The other detraction of Popstar is that it's blatantly predictable. We all know how these films about music stars/bands go, there's a breakup, downfall, and usually a rise. So when the film reaches for a little bit of dramatic weight via one of these clichés, you see it coming a mile away. With all this said, there's plenty of entertainment to be had here. It's a quick watch and the film definitely earns its R rating in a good way, so I can see the appeal here for comedy fans or anyone who has watched SNL in the last 10 years or so. But I think there just needed to be a few more big laughs under a more original story.+Surprise cameos+Lonely Island chemistry-Sometimes story takes second to cameos-Predictable5.8/10",5,20,47,7 June 2016
Bohemian Rhapsody," Infectious
","If there's one word to describe this film, it's infectious. I couldn't help but find myself bouncing up and down to We Will Rock You, humming along to Radio Gaga, and tearing up hearing We Are The Champions. If you're a fan of Queen going in, there's no doubt in my mind you will enjoy yourself. I think where people are finding flaws with the film are in that it doesn't break any molds or cliches in terms of musical biopics, nor does it particularly follow the story of Queen factually. But really, what movie does? Rami Malek is a brilliantly charismatic Freddie Mercury and the direction here is visceral, even if it does get messy a bit at times. This may be a paint by numbers biopic in terms of structure, but it's an absolutely thrilling watch with a concert like atmosphere. Fantastic.9.0/10",9,3,4,15 November 2018
Bird Box," Underwhelming
","I'm only comparing it because just about everyone online is doing the same, but remember when A Quiet Place displayed relentless tension with a PG-13 rating and made great use of its cast in a contained setting? Well Bird Box has big great ideas with an even better cast, but chooses to rarely explore those ideas and talents to its full potential. A post-apocalyptic film based on the 2014 novel of the same name by Josh Malerman, focuses on a mother and her two children who navigate the terrifying landscapes of a world where a certain 'presence' is able to manipulate your brain into killing yourself if you look in its direction outdoors. Just reading what I just typed out could either make the film sound incredibly stupid or incredibly scary. It's neither. Director Susanne Bier establishes a creepy mood and tone throughout, but never follows through with any true horror or scares. The best way I can describe it as a sporting event that has all the hype and potential but due to several different circumstances is a slightly boring and extremely underwhelming piece of entertainment.6.0/10",6,2,5,31 December 2018
The Bourne Identity," A Man With Many Names
","It's hard to believe The Bourne franchise is over 14 years old. With 4 successful films under its belt to this point, and one more on the way, Jason Bourne has become one of Hollywood's most enduring protagonists. Luckily, after so long and many repeated viewings, The Bourne Identity still holds up.Before Paul Greengrass came on board and gave us a few heart stopping thrill rides, Doug Liman directed the first entry in the series. While there are a few dated stylistic choices by Liman, he did a great job kicking off the series. It was released in 2002, but it definitely has a 90's action-thriller vibe from its look and feel. It's also far less cinematic than its successors and in turn makes for a great cable watch (which is probably why I've seen this film north of 10 times).As I understand, the film's budget spiraled after several re-shoots and push back's, so John Powell had little to work with in terms of a natural score. I feel like that helped him create a more grounded sound and tone to the series, as he has gone on to score 3 more Bourne films. Powell's score, along with the great end credits Moby tag, make for one good listen. The Bourne Identity doesn't nearly have the scope that the Greengrass films do, but it has a surprisingly amount of awareness for an action film. The entire series is more cerebral than it gets credit for.Accompanying Matt Damon as Bourne himself, is an impressive cast that consists of German star Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Brian Cox, and Clive Owen. Potente serves a great counter to Damon in that they both play lost souls searching for answers. She also essentially plays the audience, who is going along with Bourne as he ventures deep into his past. Owen, Cooper, and Cox are all great as different levels of C.I.A. agents. Particularly, Clive Owen, who does so much with so little amount of dialogue.I'm of the belief that, besides Legacy, the Bourne films get better as the series goes on. With a charismatic performance from Damon, in a somewhat unlikable role, it's all the more impressive just how successful these films have become. Hopefully that continues moving forward.+Damon's commitment+Supporting cast+Powell's grounded score+Good action, but better characters-Some dated stylistic choices9.0/10",9,2,2,26 July 2016
Baby Driver," B-a-b-y
","Let me start this off by saying that Hollywood needs more films like Baby Driver. Not just because the originality is off the charts, but because I wish more films boasted this much irreverent fun. It's Edgar Wright, so you know it's going to be stylish, but there really hasn't been another film this year that has matched the amount of chaotic entertainment in Baby Driver. I guess you could say it's this year's Deadpool.With all that out of the way, I should now say that I didn't find there to be anything significantly impressive about any one character in the film. Ansel Elgort and Lily James have great chemistry, as you'd expect. Kevin Spacey is an intimidating but somehow charming antagonist, as you'd expect. Jaime Foxx plays a foul-mouthed henchman, as you'd expect. Jon Hamm, Eliza Gonzalez, and Jon Bernthal aren't given much depth either. I guess my point is, Baby Driver gathered a bunch of extremely talented actors for a film, and failed to put together an impressive story with interesting characters. Elgort's 'Baby' is given a semi-interesting but prototypical backstory, but the rest are given absolutely nothing.However, you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn't enjoy the soundtrack and overall flow of the film. The action sequences are nicely spaced out and the music is perfectly timed up. It's not uncustomary to have a great soundtrack in an Edgar Wright film, but it's unprecedented for a film to have this much success using music to drive the story and action. Wasn't it difficult to not join Elgort while he's dancing to the beat through the streets of Atlanta?The soundtrack is addicting, the action is thrilling, and the performances are more than serviceable. If only Wright gave a little more attention to developing each character so that their motivations weren't so shallow, we may have one of the best films of the year on our hands. Without much to grapple onto, Baby Driver is just a little bit above a decent action-crime-thriller.+Soundtrack is killer+Action is well-shot and paced-Characters lack depth-Motivations should be fleshed out7.0/10",7,7,15,2 July 2017
Justice League," A Jumbled Mess that Still Kept Me Smiling (For the Most Part)
","I've waited years for Justice League. I've been wanting to see the greatest superheroes take the big screen together for as long as I can remember. Sadly, the biggest takeaway I had after stepping out of the theater was that we could and should have waited longer. The production of this film, and really the PR for the DC Universe as a whole, was an absolute mess. I don't think we'll ever get to see Zack Snyder's initial vision for this film, and that's unfortunate. But what we got is a jumbled mess of a film visually and thematically, with some undeniably fun moments mixed in. (FULL SPOILERS FOLLOW).It's hard to review a film like that, which is why I waited until after I saw the film a second time, but even now I'm not exactly sure how I feel about the finished** product. Because in reality, this film is so far from finished it's honestly sad that it was put in theaters. So I guess that's where I'll start, the visuals. Coming off visually stunning films like Man of Steel and even Batman v Superman to an extent, Snyder's visual aesthetic is beginning to fade on my taste. That's not all his fault, as he didn't have anything to do with the film for the last 8 months, after suffering a personal tragedy. The people at fault here are the executives at Warner Bros who allowed this film to be released now instead of waiting until the visual effects are finished. You know something is wrong when almost every scene involves the background shots to be in soft focus (a dead ringer that the CGI/green screen effects are far from finished, and that's not even mentioning the completely muddled 3rd act final fight.But let's talk about the good before we get too deep with the issues. The tea itself is fun, and they worked better together than I expected. I won't even say that half of the jokes/inner play works because a lot of it feels forced and re-shot a mere month or two ago, but I was definitely smiling watching the league together for the first time. Aside from the fact that he's 100% not returning after JL, Ben Affleck was serviceable as Batman. Ezra Miller certainly provided the most comedic relief. Jason Momoa showed me enough to get me intrigued for Aquaman. Cavill was of course great as Superman. Ray Fisher was leaps and bounds better than i thought he would be as Cyborg. And Gal Gadot was expectedly the best part of the film as Wonder Woman.The other good comes from the runtime and pace of the film. And I mean that strictly in terms of the fact that there isn't an hour of that passes in between action sequences (BvS). The film flies by. Now does it actually flow from one scene to the next? No, not really. You can't really tell what scenes Whedon added in, but you can tell that this film was still a work in progress all the way up until its release, which is why nothing seems to flow for a good portion of the film.Briefly, I would like to touch upon Danny Elfman's score, which is utterly forgettable. With all the fuss about him using old Batman and Superman themes, it's not even used in a memorable way. I wouldn't even be able to tell you what his JL theme sounds like because it was absent from the film in every way. He did not at all use the themes Hans Zimmer provided this universe to the best of his abilities.The villain, Steppenwolf, played by brilliant Game of Thrones alum Ciaran Hinds, was like a Marvel villain in that he served his purpose, but failed to be memorable. There are a few scenes that are quite impressive with him, including an epic one on Themiscyra, but I'm not coming out of the film buzzing about Steppenwolf. But I can say I enjoyed the team as a whole and individually. It's a lot easier to see that upon second viewing. And with that said, I'm definitely still wanting to see more with the universe going forward. Yes, the film looks pretty bad compared to other big superhero films. Yes, the action isn't fluid and is often times a CGI/video-game looking mess. Yes, they still haven't completely figured out the tone of these films. Yes, it seems Affleck is going to step-down as Batman. Yes the film does leave you with an after credits scene of Jesse Eisenberg (the worst thing this universe has ever put to screen, but more on that another time). And yes, I do actually believe this is a step down from Batman V Superman (in terms of being a film that moved me to have real emotions no matter what emotion that is). But I'm STILL on board for this universe, if they do some restructuring here and there. Why? Well, in the words of Wonder Woman, I'm a believer.7.6/10",7,2,4,17 November 2017
Man of Steel," Hope
","In preparation for the upcoming Batman V Superman film, I've decided to revisit a few of each of the heroes' feature films, especially those where they come in direct conflict with one another.Man of Steel is known to be one of the most divisive films of this century. You either love it or hate it, there's really no in between with this film. I fall on the love side. There are problems with the film as it's by no means a perfect film. But it may be as close as a superhero film could get to being a masterpiece.Zack Snyder is very much the auteur of this project. Christopher Nolan and David Goyer's hands are definitely in the script and tone, but Snyder's direction is among the most inventive and visually stunning in this genre. Snyder takes the campy tone of some of Superman's previous entries and flips it into a bleak, grim, and destructive story. But it works for the film they were going for. In many ways this is the truest to comics form of Superman we have ever had. Henry Cavill's physique resembles the comics more so than Brandon Routh's or Christopher Reeve's, and he's never been more powerful than seen in this film. Snyder also crafted an incredibly detailed Krypton for the first 20 minutes of the film, which tended to be one of the many things everyone agreed to be a positive for the film. Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon kick off the film with a great Jor-El/General Zod fight which makes for the centerpiece for the rest of the film as Zod attempts to stop the launch of Kal-El (Suprman) to earth. I loved the way they switched the mythology to make Kal the true last son of Krypton as the first natural birth in centuries. The rest of the film entails Kal's adapting to earth and Zod's search for him.The heart of the film comes from Kal's earth family, the Kent's. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane play his parents and share some of the best scenes of the film. Again, they flipped the history a bit in the death of Pa Kent being an event Superman could have prevented, but it makes for one of the most emotionally devastating scenes of the film. The relationship between Clark and his mother tend to be my favorite scenes as they are both written incredibly well and heart-warming in feel.The action and destruction is some of the more controversial aspects of the film with both the Smallville fight and the infamous Metropolis ending. I've always been a fan of Snyder's unique take on action and fight choreography but the destruction is a complaint I can sort of understand. But everyone should remember that this was the first few days that Clark/Kal realized his abilities as Superman. He didn't have time to think about and strategize how he fight the Kryptonians. Give the guy a break. Those Krytponians, however, do give him their best shot, including Antje Traue's ferocious Faora-Ul.There are moments of Man of Steel that could have been cut down like the Terraforming snake-like machine scene and a few expositional scenes, but the bottom line is that Snyder creating something in Man of Steel that transcends the superhero genre. He gave us one of the more visually stunning and morally thought provoking entries in this genre, and that's an achievement. Hans Zimmer's score is among the greatest for any superhero film, perfectly balancing the grim tone with a heroic center figure. I expect the romantic chemistry between Amy Adams and Henry Cavill to be improved in Batman v Superman and the destruction to be addressed. To me though, Man of Steel is a force to be reckoned with for all superhero films.+Heroic Zimmer score+Visually stunning+Intricate story by Nolan+Snyder's attention to detail+Cavill is the definitive Superman+Father figures+Diane Lane-Romantic chemistry-Run-time could have been cut down10/10",10,2,6,24 March 2016
28 Weeks Later," Terrifyingly Unexpected
","The 21st century has been flooded with films and TV shows about zombie apocalypses, so it's difficult for any of them to stand out and feel completely fresh. But there's something about the '28' series that really hits well for me. There's something so glorious about seeing the streets of London be a wasteland that only occupies a select few living and undead.Similar to how the Cloverfield films are related but not directly tied in, 28 Days Later is a prequel of sorts, but the characters and plot are entirely different. 28 Weeks Later picks up after London is deemed safe and virus free, as the undead have starved to death after the events of the previous film. Of course, apparently it was a good idea for the military to reoccupy London and start building up a civilization again, even though it was the center of disaster only a half a year earlier. Implausible probably, but we've never really seen an apocalyptic series that attempts to go back and restart civilization from the same area. Usually we either see everything as the apocalypse is going down, or maybe several years later. So, in that way I like what the film tried to do.I also found the cast to be quite impressive. Not only do you have some nice lead turns from Robert Carlyle and Catherine McCormack, but you have Idris Elba, Rose Byrne, Jeremy Renner, and Imogen Poots before they became famous. All of which, do a wonderful job in roles that aren't necessarily flushed out. That partly because it's only 100 minutes long, but mostly because the film never takes a breath. That could lead to pacing and character issues, but with a non-stop action-horror, it actually works to the benefit of the experience. Adding to that experience are running zombies. Yeah, I'm looking at you every other horror film, it's cool to make them run.But perhaps the biggest compliment I can give to the film is its utterly unpredictable. With a horror film, you expect there to be an ample amount of deaths, but the way in which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo directs the deaths is terrifyingly unexpected. And when you can't see where the terror is coming from in a horror film than you're in for something special. In all, 28 Weeks Later improves upon 'Days' scares, story, characters, and plot to make for one exciting entry in the horror/sci-fi/drama genre. +Great performances+Horrific scares+Refreshing take on apocalyptic zombie flicks+Unpredictable9.0/10",9,0,2,7 May 2017
The Thing," Ridley Scott's 'Alien' at a Research Facility
","The Thing being the second John Carpenter film I've watched this week, I'm starting to notice why he's such a 'big deal' in the film business, but I'm also realizing that his style may not be best suited for my tastes in film. The Thing is a remake of a 1951 Howard Hawks film, which in itself is based on a novella, and the film was once again remade in 2011. Ultimately, this story is widely popular. But the funny thing is, the story doesn't feel all that special or unique. The film adapts the 'whodunit' or rather 'who is it' movie trope that has been used for as long as films have been made. I don't have a problem with that, but I do have a problem with this film feeling like a rip-off to Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film. Right down to the chest bursting scene.Some people may say that the original novella probably influenced Scott in making Alien, which may be true. But then why not change up a few plot points and shot selections instead of feeling overtly derivative from a film that is only a few years old. It also doesn't help that for all the blood, guts, jumps, and scares, we don't really get a look inside the minds of any of these characters. None of them are memorable, even Kurt Russell's flame throwing bearded helicopter pilot. Heck, we never even see the guy fly a helicopter.I hate to keep bringing up Alien, so I'll compare the recent movie, Life. That film doesn't have anything new to add to the genre of 'trapped-in-horror-thriller', but it consistently entertains you because you get to know each character and you care about them. The Thing's cast consists of a dozen or so men ranging from 30-65, and I don't remember any of their names or backstories. Why? Because the movie didn't take the time to establish either.The Thing does do quite a few things well, though. The practical special effects are mind-blowing for a film from the early-80's. I would love to see some of the behind the scenes featurettes and how they were able to pull off some of the shots. If only the film didn't make me cringe every few minutes with its gratuitous blood spatters and gut bursting shots. The Thing also did a nice job at pacing out the deaths and jump scares where it didn't feel too overpowering at any one point but it also never got to the point of boredom either. Not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting main theme that plays throughout the film. That will surely send chills down anyone's spine. So overall, The Thing is another Carpenter film to get a mixed response from me. He's a good filmmaker, but I highly doubt I will ever sit down a re-watch his films as religiously as some film fans do. Perhaps I'd like Howard Hawks version better.+Score+Effects-No character depth-Feels derivative6.4/10",6,4,7,23 April 2017
He Got Game," One of Denzel's Most Underrated
","As a massive sports fan and a movie lover, He Got Game has always been near the top of my watchlist, but for whatever reason, it took many years for me to finally pop it in and check it out. From someone who has only seen a small handful of Spike Lee films, He Got Game felt like a solid (if somewhat lacking) entry into his filmography. Spike made the choice of having Ray Allen play the local legend 'Jesus Shuttlesworth' instead of choosing a real actor, which in my mind could be seen as a massive mistake or a brilliant decision, I go both ways. On one hand, it's often a distraction when big films try and pass a normal actor as an incredibly gifted athlete but you also run the risk of an athlete being exposed up against other talented actors in the film. That's exactly what happens here. Not only does Allen fail to give Jesus any sort of personality, but his skills (or lack thereof) are suspect when Denzel is on screen. It would be one thing if the film was more basketball than life focused, but it's not. Luckily, I think that's where the movie's strengths are, when the film delves deep into Jake's psyche and not worrying too much about the basketball side. Would I have hoped for a more well-rounded film? Of course, but there's still plenty to like here.7.0/10",7,0,0,21 April 2020
The Revenant," You Only Die Twice
","A year ago around this time I think everyone predicted that The Revenant would finally be the film to get Leonardo DiCaprio his Oscar. While I'm not sure his performance holds up against the other greats of 2015, particularly Fassbender as Steve Jobs, I will say that The Revenant is a cinematic achievement and one that should be recognized. It contains probably the most impressive cinematography of any film of this past year to go along with the jarring brutality this story brings to the table. While I don't think The Revenant is the best film of the year, it certainly deserves to be in the discussion.The Revenant is a far more artsy film than I expected. It's directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, director of last years' best picture winner Birdman, and done so brilliantly. The direction along with Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is some of the best of the year. I think the problem with the film lies more with the script, also co-written by Iñárritu. The film is centered on DiCaprio's character seeking revenge against the man who left him for dead and killed his son after getting mauled by a bear, but the film lacks balance in its storytelling. I love the brutal, raw, grittiness of the story and you certainly feel the intensity in those scenes. But the minimal dialogue and in Tom Hardy's case, sometimes inaudible dialogue, you sometimes lose the emotional connection to the characters.The gorgeous cinematography does tend to overtake the films other appealing aspects, such as the great performances from Hardy and DiCaprio. Knowing about the incredibly difficult shoot they went through behind the scenes attempting to make the film helps their Oscar case in my opinion now that I've seen it. But I somehow still expected more from both of them. One of the best parts about The Revenant, that The Hateful Eight also did extremely well, was set the tone of the film through its atmosphere. In both films you feel what the characters feel. When DiCaprio was hungry or thirsty, I was too. It helps that the film was shot entirely in natural light and real locations, which is unusual for a main stream feature. There are plenty of memorable scenes in The Revenant including an incredible opening long-take fight sequence, the now famous bear mauling, and the films brutally bloody climax. The Revenant is far from a let down, but I also don't think it reaches the heights that we expected when we heard about the film over a year ago.+DiCaprio's commitment+Legendary cinematography+Memorable scenes+Sets the atmosphere perfectly-Perhaps a little too artsy-Lacks balance in its storytelling8.2/10",8,1,4,7 January 2016
Bridge of Spies," Sometimes People Think Wrong
","I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.+Rylance & Hanks together+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War+Newman's score+Climax-Lack of intensity-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together7.0/10",7,8,12,18 October 2015
Split," The Broken Are the More Evolved
","It's fitting that a film released by one of the most divisive directors of all time is titled Split, seemingly welcoming 'split' opinions from audiences. And yes, I will consider myself one of those audience members who is 'split' on his views.I've never went out of my way to see any of M. Night Shyamalan's films. There's something off-putting about knowing there's a twist coming rather than letting happen naturally in a film's plot. And with Shyamalan, you know there's a twist coming. It's virtually impossible to talk about this film without spoiling anything so here's your final chance to stop reading before this review goes off the rails.So I guess this film is related to Unbreakable, one of Shyamalan's films I have yet to see. Or rather, can be considered an indirect sequel to the beloved 2000 superhero thriller. The uniquely disturbing lead character(s) from Split, played by James McAvoy appears to be yet another enhanced human in the Unbreakable universe. Having not seen that film yet, it was hard for me to get excited about this relation at first, especially if this was the 'twist' everyone was freaking out about. With that said, the fact that Shyamalan was able to hide this from the general public up until the film's premiere, is impressive and unprecedented.So aside from the divisive ending, I found the entire film to be just alright. McAvoy was always magnetic, even as the terrifying beast or the irritating Hedwig. The Visit was a nice return to form for Shyamalan and Split definitely proves he is capable of making of cohesive thriller once again. The one problem I've always had with his films is that they seem to depend too heavily on the big twists instead of making a film stand on its own. For something who hasn't seen Unbreakable, I'm not sure it does stand well on its own. I think I'll be able to have a better appreciation for Split once I see Unbreakable, but a film shouldn't be dependent on another to succeed. Even the best Marvel Universe films, which spans nearly a decade of world building, can stand on their own.If I'm grading the film based on the powerhouse that is McAvoy, then I can give it my stamp of approval. But everything outside of his performance, is just average. I realize not having an actual opinion is unproductive in terms of a review, but I'm not going to pretend that I really enjoyed or really disliked the movie. So for now, the jury is still out on Split.+McAvoy+Shyamalan improves on thrills-Twists & turns didn't have the biggest payoffs, for me-Nothing too special6.1/10",6,1,9,27 January 2017
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Brilliant Set-up
","There have been quite a few times, especially recently, when dividing the last story of a franchise into two parts was a huge mistake. But then there is the Harry Potter series, which managed to make a well- strung first part, which ranks among the franchise's best, to set up one of the greatest conclusions in film history.Upon first viewing, I wasn't a huge fan of the first Deathly Hallows. To me, it was missing its own identity and conclusion to feel like its own film. Of course, this was before having seen part 2. Now that I have gone back and re-watched each film, I have grown more of an appreciation for the series as a whole, and particularly, Deathly Hallows Part 1. There are certainly still some minute problems that can be annoying, like Voldemort's minimal presence, but this was the first movie that solely focused on the trio of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. That was a welcomed shift for me.After the last 3 films, it seemed like the series had already grown up enough. But I like the fact that this film wasn't just them cutting ties with their family and loved ones to find horcruxes, it was about them becoming adults capable of doing things on their own. So in many ways, this is a film about unity and independence at the same time. I love watching the trio have to go on the road and figure out all of the horcruxes without the help of their parents or Dumbledore. It makes the payoff in the 8th movie all the more gratifying.This may be a stretch, but this film feels a lot like a Western set in the Potterverse. In fact, there are a lot of the same characteristics as a revenge or fantasy-western. On the run, looking for something significant, and constantly fighting off the looming presence of a bigger evil. To me, that's a fantasy western. No matter, the film has its fair share of thrilling sequences of action along with some needed heartfelt moments between the trio. The relationship particularly between Harry and Hermione has never been a focus, in fact rarely touched upon, until this film. Even though there's nothing romantic at all, it became one of the series' most endearing bonds. Of course, Ron didn't seem to think so, as he got jealous in the most clichéd way possible. But again, Harry and Ron needed that conflict to make the payoff of Ron coming back to save Harry and destroying a Horcrux all the more satisfying.Plenty of other noteworthy sequences include a brilliantly thoughtful Tale of the 3 Brothers story told by Hermione, Dobby's return, Umbridge's unsettling return, and even the opening escape sequence. I know it isn't beloved by the fandom like the others, but I believe Deathly Hallows is a necessary deviation from the typical trip to the Potterverse so that part 2 is as epic as we know it is.

Little Miss Sunshine," An Unforgettable Journey
","An absolutely wonderful original script, picture perfect cast, and a journey unlike anything you typically see in movies, Little Miss Sunshine is a gem that I'm mad I missed out on when it was released. It's not often a film provides a story that feels entirely fresh and modern (while also being 15 years old), but that's what this film can offer. Not everything wraps up entirely how you want or expect, some arcs don't get the closure, but the performances and ending we got are exceptional.8.6/10",8,0,0,10 March 2020
Coriolanus," It Shall Be So
","We have many great modern day adaptations of books or plays that have worked in changing the setting. I have to say that Coriolanus is not one of those. It is set in a modern day alternative Rome and tries to tell the tragic tale of Coriolanus while also keeping the Shakespearian dialogue.Not only is the dialogue a bit confusing, it just doesn't seem right when you see people holding out cell phones at the same time. I may be in the minority but nothing seemed to click with this film. Ralph Fiennes did a phenomenal job as the lead, but then again isn't he always good? Gerard Butler was fine but didn't seem to compliment Fiennes enough. The supporting cast is pretty good but besides Fiennes nobody seemed to stand out.I definitely appreciate the ambition that Fiennes brings considering the risk of a project like this, but I just didn't seem to enjoy all the risks taken. The film has several slow parts with a few cool fight scenes but it definitely drags. Perhaps ill attempt to read the play and then go back and re-watch the film to get a better understanding of why this story is so revered.+Fiennes +Ambitious directing...-...But the time line just doesn't fit with the dialogue -Drags -The rest of the cast didn't really stand out 5.2/10",5,2,5,10 November 2014
The Orphanage," Simple & Sophisticated
","Sometimes the best thing a horror film can do is simplify itself. The Orphanage benefits from having a strong and grounded performance from Belén Rueda, without overwhelming it's plot with supernatural clichés and jump scares.One thing is for certain, J.A. Bayona is phenomenal director. I've heard great things about his upcoming 'A Monster Calls', 'The Impossible' is one of the most heart-wrenching films of all time, and The Orphanage kicked off his directing with a bang. But there's one thing all of those films have in common, they deal with a mother's relationship to her son. I've obviously never met Bayona, but he had to have a strong connection to his mother. And among other things, that was the most satisfying element to The Orphanage. Guillermo del Toro produced this, and as much as I love a lot of his films, sometimes his films are more about spectacle than they are about real human emotion. Luckily, Bayona gave plenty of that to The Orphanage.Movies about disappearances or deaths of children are always very difficult to watch. Especially the films that take a horror approach, like The Orphanage. Kids are always creepy in horror-thrillers, there's just no two ways about it. But as long as Belén Rueda keeps her performance grounded, this movie stays afloat. This movie certainly delves into some things that we have seen in horror films before, mostly having to do with supernatural ideas or dream-like people returning from the dead, but I never found myself all that invested in those scenes. I'm far more interested in seeing how a mother reacts to her child go missing. The film doesn't necessarily have as many layers as other horror-thrillers, but as a first time director, I couldn't have asked for more from Bayona. Hopefully 'A Monster Calls' and The Jurassic World sequel continue the string of great work from him.+Mother-son relationship+Stays relatively grounded+Simple story-Could have had a little bit more depth7.7/10",7,0,2,7 January 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Animated Film of the Year
","We've gotten to the point in this golden-age of comic book movies where studios are starting to feel more comfortable taking storytelling risks. With Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Sony not only took a huge risk with the animation style, it's lead character, and bold story choices, but it's actually a very good film in its own right. Blending a heartfelt story, well-timed humor, and a bold animation style, Spider-Verse is the best Spider-Man film to date, and one that should garner all sorts of accolades. If it wasn't for an ending that gets bloated with hectic animation, it could flirt with some of my favorite animated movies of all time list. Either way, it's fun, infectious, and shows that the superhero genre has a long way to go before it runs out of unique ideas.8.9/10",8,5,10,19 December 2018

","Understandable but it's certainly unfair to refer to this film as 'Braveheart lite' but it's almost impossible to not draw comparisons to both Gibson films.

Edward Scissorhands," And So Depp and Burton Begins
","If you had to name the most famous director-actor collaborations working in Hollywood today, I would bet Johnny Depp and Tim Burton are among the first you would name. Edward Scissorhands was the first film they collaborated on and is probably considered by most to be their best. For me I think the film is a bit overrated. It wants us to believe that this is a man we should all feel sorry for, which we do, but it also tries to convince us that his wrongdoings aren't his fault. While I believe this 'man' deserves to be treated like a human, but I don't think mixing him with other humans and not thinking chaos would eventually happen was the right move.Depp is great as the title role. In fact it's hard to believe anybody else really playing this role. For once he actually gave a tremendous amount of subtly to this strange role and he also gave it a lot of heart. But the problem is that I don't think the supporting characters were developed enough. Not only that, but I don't think any of them actually seem like people who would live in a real world. Perhaps that's the point. Winona Ryder's character has a far too sudden change of mind half way through the film, and her boyfriend is the most clichéd ex boyfriend ever. But I did enjoy watching Depp play this character. And I think his 'mother' had some really great scenes with him as well.So the problem isn't so much the actual story but rather the execution. There are few Burton movies that I thoroughly enjoy so perhaps my problem is more so with him than the rest of the crew. His films tend to be split down the middle with audiences so I think this may be one that I have to sit on and re-watch for further appreciation.+Depp's subtly emotional performance +Dianne West -clichéd characters-Style over substance 6.0/10",6,0,2,13 January 2015
Divergent," Not as Intriguing as i would have hoped.
","There's a lot to like and there's also a lot to shake your head with this film. For one, it shouldn't be over 2 hours. Its near 140 minutes but a good chunk is spent just watching the same training over and over again. Shailene Woodley was good in the movie, and I also found that I like her love interest Theo James. I thought his character was much more interesting than Peeta and Gail in the Hunger Games Movies. With that said, I know a lot of people really loved this movie, and I respect that. But I just wasn't thrilled with how it played out.Before the negatives there are a few positives that made the film at least an enjoyable watch in theaters. I really thought all the actors fit their role, and I thought each character was written very well. Except for the parents but ill get to that later. Each of Tris' friends once she picks her group were fun. And even the twist with a few of the characters later were interesting and kept me guessing. Miles Teller was funny and delivered a few lines that I got a good chuckle out of. I think its funny how Woodley already has a film with Teller as her love interest and a movie with Caleb (Tris' Brother) as her love interest. The ending turned out to be better than the other 3/4 of the movie.Now onto the negatives, some actors were completely underused in this movie. Kate Winslet (who I expected to have a menacing presence) may have had close to 15 lines in the entire film. Also the parents were given little screen time, and were then just killed off right after each other. The scene with the mom dying was a little emotional sure but I didn't feel connected to these characters due to the few lines and how they randomly show up. The dad's death was poorly handled as well. The music in this movie never seemed to fit. The score that you rarely here was decent (Hans Zimmer). But really all the songs used seemed out of place. I'm never a big fan of any songs that appear in films, much rather stick to the scores. A few scenes the CGI is unbelievably noticeable which shouldn't happen with a big budget film like this one. There were also several CHEESY parts, including a few romance scenes that made me cringe at how awkward they made us feel.Not reading the book, I kinda felt like I was left with several unanswered questions, but perhaps the sequel will address them. I really hope Allegiant is better, and the change of director may help considering Catching Fire was substantially better than the original Hunger Games and they had a change of director. We shall see, but Overall it can be enjoyable with interesting characters and some cool ideas but disappointed with the final product. 6.7/10",6,13,25,21 March 2014
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," A Brutal and Riveting Crime-Mystery-Thriller
","One of the things that kept me away from this movie for so long was how graphic I had heard it was. But I have become prone to gory and graphic films over the years so what better time to watch it than a month before David Fincher's new film, Gone Girl is released. I really like all of Fincher's movies and I think The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is among his best. All of his movies have a dark tone and look to them. This is no exception. He sets this beautifully creepy world perfectly and puts his actors in the right position to be successful. I haven't seen the original trilogy so I'm unable to compare for now, but I can say that Rooney Mara and Daniel Craig are perfect for these two roles.It's hard to watch a movie with Daniel Craig and not automatically think James Bond, and have him not be the most intimidating character on screen. Mara is downright frightening but also charismatic as Lisbeth, the troubled young woman who struggles to find her way in life. But she's good at one thing, investigating. It's her job to help Craig in finding out what truly happened to Harriet, the granddaughter of Henrik, the man who hired them. As you do with most mysteries, you begin to suspect every suspiciously acting character shown. I have to say it was pretty hard to identify just who was involved. Fincher did a great job with storytelling here, and making us second guess ourselves several times.When Mara and Craig do finally team up about an hour in, the film takes itself to a new level and the intensity amps up. I did find it strange that Mara didn't think twice about working with Craig, especially after illegally investigating him. One of the most incredibly acted scenes was with Skarsgard and Craig in the basement cellar. The back and forth is fascinating and the way Skarsgard thinks exactly what he's describing is normal is astounding. But even then Fincher keeps twisting the story. Which is one of the problems I had with the film, it seemed like there were 3 or 4 different endings but it kept going. And the actual final scene wasn't as satisfying as I had hoped considering it's unlikely they will film the two sequels.This is without a doubt one of the better crime-drama-mystery-thrillers I have seen. The intensity throughout kept me on the edge of my seat and I didn't know what to expect next. It's this type of directing I am looking for in next month's Gone Girl. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is one of the best thrillers in recent memory and is up there with Fight Club, Se7en, and Zodiac as his best overall film.+Mara's performance was captivating +Intense and riveting +Dark tone is beautifully captured +Craig is not a bad*** +Unpredictable -Last scene not satisfying 9.0/10",9,1,3,4 September 2014
In the Name of the Father," Courtroom Classic
","Courtroom drama's are always prime for great cinema. In the Name of the Father is no different. It shouldn't come as any surprise with Daniel Day-Lewis as the lead, and he is incredible as Gerry Conlon, a wrongfully convicted terrorist in 1970's London. I have to admit I didn't know much about the bombings upon viewing, so this whole story came as a shock to me. But the film is a really good eye opener and reminder that no one is guilty until proved innocent, and then some.Pete Postlethwaite and Emma Thompson were both nominated for supporting roles and they really do carry this film. I would almost say more so than Day-Lewis. I knew he would give a killer performance but i didn't know the other two had this in them, especially Postlethwaite. The film also closely deals with the relationship between Gerry and his father. The many ups and downs they go through as a result of being in a jail for so many years. Gerry is a scoundrel at best towards the beginning. They show him stealing right off the bat to give us the impression that this may be a character you may not be able to trust. In fact, I wasn't even sure if I could trust him up until he was being beaten by the detectives to sign the confession.I will say I wasn't a huge fan of the direction to begin the film. Jim Sheridan had a knack for choppy directing early on that was hard to follow. But once the film settles in and gets going as a true courtroom genre, the film takes off. I also like that the film tackles the issue of non-violent vs. violent protests and tactics in a fair way. It isn't clear to me that the filmmakers believe one way or the other is the way to go. And I think that's the right way to go about it. +All the performances+Tension built in the court-Choppy directing to start8.4/10",8,1,1,16 September 2015
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," A Raunchy Romance
","Comedy is probably the one genre that is most difficult to hold up over time. It's the one genre that isn't timeless. Most jokes rely on pop culture references, but The 40-Year-Old Virgin manages to do the impossible, make a timeless comedy.In my opinion, this is Steve Carell and Judd Apatow at their best. While most Carell roles are filled with goofy and over-the-top humor, and most Apatow films are overlong and too raunchy, this film hits on all those cylinders in a good way. This is one of the dirtiest and raunchiest films that I've seen, but I can't picture it working any other way. Especially because that side of things makes you appreciate the really sweet romance between Carell and Catherine Keener. That relationship only works if you understand the world he's living in outside of his romance with her, and the stakes that the film sets up.This film also features what is perhaps the greatest comedy ensemble of this generation. You have Carell just beginning to hit his prime, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco all rounding out the work group of friends pushing him to lose his virginity. That's not even mentioning Keener, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and a young Kat Dennings and Jonah Hill. All of them create such memorable characters and scenes with the help of Apatow and Carell's hilarious dialogue. And yes, Apatow had done a bit of television work prior to this, but it's his first directorial effort for a feature film. Quite the impressive start.There are so many infamously memorable scenes. From the body waxing, to the poker table, the condom scene, the shenanigans from Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann drunk driving, or the speed dating scene. From beginning to end, this was comedy gold. And surprisingly, every joke hit just as hard as it did when I first saw the film years ago. Sure, it's hard not to acknowledge the films raunchy humor, but the romance is just as good.+Still holds up+The work group is perfectly cast+Balance between comedy and romance+Impeccably written9.5/10",9,0,0,29 April 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Desperate Times, Desperate Measures
","There are summer blockbusters, and then there are the Mission: Impossible films. I love that the franchise continues to top itself, and doing so without trying to push the envelope to far. This franchise isn't as crazy as say The Fast and Furious franchise, and it's not as serious as the Bond franchise. It finds a perfect balance of realism and absurdity. That balance is probably due to having a new director with a fresh take each and every film. They realized it was pretty hard to top the Burj Khalifa scene in M:I 4, but the stunts and action sequences are just as good. It may not have had the showmanship as that particular scene did, but I don't think an M:I film has ever been so thrilling with wall to wall action. It was also going to be difficult to top Phillip Seymour-Hoffman's villain in M:I 3, and while the villain here doesn't reach the intimate highs that Hoffman had in that film, this baddie does just as much evil being off screen as he does on screen. So I know all film is subjective, and I enjoy almost all of the M:I films, I think Rogue Nation may just be the finest installment yet.This time out Ethan Hunt and his crew are on the run (or going rogue as they say it) as the IMF is on the Dl after the CIA dissolved them. Everything goes awry when Hunt is captured by Lane's crew but is quickly let go by a mysterious woman by the name of Isla. Let me just say, because I cant wait any longer, where in the world has Rebecca Ferguson been? Or rather, where did she come from? Ferguson plays Isla, and does so marvelously. Most of the film we are left guessing as to which side she truly lies her allegiance with but it really works to the characters benefit. This girl is a complete bada**, and even that doesn't do her justice. I don't know what the plans are for the 6th film, but I sure hope they bring her back. Getting back to Rogue Nation, another reason why this film is one of the best of the summer is it's unpredictability. I loved Ghost Protocol, but after watching it recently, and then now seeing this film, I don't think it holds a candle to Rogue Nation. Even going by the villain here, Solomon Lane, he's a much more maniacal, twisted, psychogenius if you will. But the film has many more surprises in store. I thought by watching all the trailers, and many times I may add, that I would know too much or have seen to much. But I was wrong, there's plenty left to be seen here.Speaking of which, the major action scene that everyone is talking about is the plane scene shown in all the trailers. I was thrilled and shocked to see that it was only the first few minutes and didn't even play a role in the overall plot. It just goes to show you how much the people behind the film had planned. Another great stunt was the underwater extravaganza where Cruise apparently had to learn how to hold his breath for 6 minutes at a time for shooting. Christopher McQuarrie directed this sequence in such a beautiful and surprisingly quiet manner. I loved his long and virtually silent takes as we watched Ethan Hunt nail yet another mission. But I have to be honest, I think the most thrilling part of the entire film was the motorcycle chase sequence. Talk about a gorgeously shot segment, wow. There are few chase sequences that I legitimately thought they were going the miles per hour that they want us to believe. It's one of the best chase scenes in any film for that matter.The supporting cast in this film all get their time to shine. Even Ving Rhames, who resigned a few films back, gets his screen-time. Jeremy Renner, Brandt, first introduced in Ghost Protocol, doesn't have much action but still has several memorable moments. He even nailed his comedic moments as well, surprisingly. Simon Pegg is of course back as Benji, and his comedy once again hits the spot and never feels out of place. Alec Baldwin also had a small but pivotal role, and still proved to be one of the highlights of the picture. Seriously, all the performances were really great. I think my only gripe about the film was that sometimes the consequences to action sequences didn't feel real enough. I guess I felt that our characters walked away from danger too easily sometimes. Not on a Fast and Furious level, but close. No matter, the film has an incredible cast and lead villain, the first for the franchise in a few films. Not to mention just how well this film is paced from beginning to end and never feeling too long. I have to hand it to Tom Cruise and the crew. That man is mid 50's now and he may have just carried the best M:I film to date. Regardless, this film is loads of fun and definitely one of the best of the summer.+Pacing +Cruise still has it +Everyone shines +Great villain +Fight scenes and action pieces +Rebecca F'in Ferguson!!! +Thrill ride from beginning to end -Maybe a Fast and Furious moment here or there 9.5/10",9,4,9,30 July 2015
Spider-Man," With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility
","As dated as some of the dialogue, acting, effects shots, and plot points are, there will always be a special place in my heart for the original Spider-Man film (I'm not going to count those 70's features). This is largely due to the fact that it was the first superhero film I ever saw in a theater. I specifically remember where I saw it, who I was with, where I sat, and how terrified I was at the 3D images of the Green Goblin's face. For those reasons, I'm always keen on re- watching this one.Before the golden age of superhero film, Spider-Man came out at a time when being inspired by Donner's 1978 Superman and Burton's 1989 Batman was the norm. You can clearly see how influenced Sam Raimi was to those films, specifically with his choice of bringing in Danny Elfman to do the music. This all gives the film a very nostalgic vibe to me. However, some dated qualities manage to shine through some of the better moments.Those being the fact that Kirsten Dunst's 'Mary Jane' is essentially a useless plot device for the entire film. This doesn't necessarily change throughout the trilogy, but it's overtly clear with the first Spider-Man. My 8-year-old mind can push aside the damsel in distress moments, but 15 years later it becomes increasingly more difficult. The same goes for the dull dialogue between MJ and Peter, and the unquestionably awkward line delivery at times. I'm all for Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but their relationship isn't always sold well enough in the various scenes they have together.With that said, someone who undoubtedly does sell their scenes is Willem Dafoe. He was terrifying as Norman Osborn a child, and he still sends a few chills down my spine when I see him talking to himself through a mirror in the Osborn mansion. But he isn't just a one-note villain either. Significant time is spent developing him as a forceful antagonist, but also a troubled man with misplaced intentions. In today's age of setting up future films way too far in advance, there usually isn't enough time given to developing villains (i.e. every MCU film), but luckily that's not the case with Green Goblin.Overall, Spider-Man is clearly a dated film in many areas upon re- watch, but it's hard not to overlook them based on pure nostalgic alone. In a way, some of the dated qualities actually end up making it even more charming.+Nostalgia+Score+Dafoe-Dated, and definitely cheesy8.0/10",8,0,1,7 July 2017
Collateral," Think anybody'll notice?
","I really appreciate the actors who step out of their box and take roles that are unlike anything they have done before. Tom Cruise here plays a ruthless contract killer who's run in with an everyday cab driver turns out to be much more than what he thought. Cruise, to my knowledge, has never really played the villain. So to see him absolutely kill this role makes me think of the endless possibilities for his future career. Collateral is a near masterpiece in the crime thriller genre. I can even see influences of it in this years Nightcrawler. It is quite simply one of the best crime films of the past decade.Michael Mann gives us another classic but also presents us with a terrifically well rounded cast. Cruise and Foxx are great as the leads. But Ruffalo and Jada Pinkett Smith are also great. Not to mention the brief but memorable cameos by Statham and Bardem. I loved the dynamic between Cruise and Foxx. Max (Foxx) is just a man who never really went after his dreams while Vincent (Cruise) is just killing people for money but also at the same time wants to be known for something. I really loved the way the film presented these crimes and how Max reacted to them. Most films display murder to a normal person and they shake it off like it was nothing. But Max is truly terrified of Vincent and what he's capable of. They were never truly meant to spend significant time together, but one thing leads to another and we have the most dysfunctional relationship possible. And even Max resents Vincent for what he is doing, there is some sort of mutual respect present here. Max at one point seems to look up to him.The rides are great and it's interesting watching Cruise seamlessly play this character, but it's the ending this film is worth watching for. It was a great way to be both highly intense but at the same time mostly realistic. There may have been a few times where it seemed unrealistic, but it never took me out of this roller coaster crime thriller. Besides a few misplaced songs this film is exactly what you want from a 2 hour action film.+Cruise uncharacteristic role +Foxx displaying his multiple sides+Dysfunctional relationship +Ending -Misplaced music 9.1/10",9,2,3,2 December 2014
Dark City," A City With No Sun
","There's no doubting the imagination of Alex Proyas. Though most of Dark City is difficult to follow and is more style than substance, once the kick of the film finally happens, you realize how inventive and inspirational this film is to the science fiction genre. When push comes to shove, Dark City ranks among the weirdest and most unique sci-fi features to date.Knowing close to nothing going in was a wise choice, but I did find myself saying 'what in the world is going on?' several times. The story follows a man named John Murdoch who finds himself alone in a bathtub with no memory of who he is or where he's been. Murdoch is being hunted by both law enforcement and a mysterious group of people, known as 'The Strangers' with unknown powers and abilities. In some ways, Dark City makes for a good compilation of films like The Matrix, Minority Report, Blade Runner, and even Metropolis. For much of the film Murdoch is the audience. We have no idea where we are, who's good, who's bad, and where this all ends up. But once Murdoch starts to understand 'The Strangers' agendas, the film starts to take off.The supporting cast includes William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly, and Kiefer Sutherland. Similar to how I feel about the movie overall, I didn't really care for any of the characters in particular until you understand the context of how the film is being played out. Sutherland has the most to do, but his performance is diluted to a quick breathing nerdy doctor. I think as a whole Dark City will play better on repeated viewings. Especially because it will become more and more apparent just how many films have taken from Dark City. Proyas has made a few interesting directing choices since this one, but none quite capture the scope or uniqueness of Dark City. In the long-running genre of science fiction, Proyas' breakout film is definitely among the better ones.+Noir elements+Mystery plays out nicely+Gets better as it goes along-Could have opened up with more context8.7/10",8,2,3,20 April 2017
Dunkirk," Home
","I saw Dunkirk 4 days ago, but I really wanted to sit on the experience and not review it until I fully understood what Christopher Nolan was going for. This isn't your typical war movie, neither it terms of structure or execution. But it is how you'd expect Christopher Nolan to tackle a war epic; with a non-linear structure, tightly written and directed scenes, and one heck of a mind-blowing score from Hans Zimmer. It's far from the easiest film to dissect, but the experience is undeniably moving.Being a massive Christopher Nolan fan, I came into Dunkirk with high expectations and a ton of curiosity of how Nolan would treat a true story. This is the first film of is that attempts to take real-life events and present his own depiction. Unsurprisingly, the thing I love most about Dunkirk is Nolan's direction. Quite often war films look at the big picture (rightfully so), covering events from each side and telling in-depth stories about politics and survival. There's nothing wrong with those approaches, but the fact that Nolan takes a massive-scale approach to Dunkirk visually, when in reality the film is just about soldiers trying to survive on one particular beach, makes it all the more impressive. When you get past the fact that there's little dialogue and character development, there's plenty to love about Dunkirk.Nolan's films all have those defining visual moments, as he often loves to have his non-linear structure be used to its full effect and use the multiple story angles to create a few epic moments. Think Inception, when the 'dream is collapsing' and there's 3 different layers of dreams all coalescing at the same time. Dunkirk uses that same approach for pretty much the entire movie, The Mole (beach), The Sea, and The Air. The editing can be frustrating the first time around, as it was for me, especially when you really just want to learn more about each of these characters if they expect us to care at all. Jumping viewpoints turns out to be exactly the way this film should be structured. In reality, none of these soldiers would have time to tell each other their respected backgrounds or life stories, they're just trying to survive. I thought Nolan handled this beautifully.Complementing the rapid editing is yet another terrific Hans Zimmer score. Nolan said in an interview that he gave Zimmer a recording of a ticking clock to give him an idea as to how he wanted the tone of the score to feel. Well, Zimmer took that to heart as that ticking clock is literally heard throughout the film. I love all of the Zimmer-Nolan collaborations, and Dunkirk is no exception. In fact, Zimmer's score could almost be considered more of an impactful character than the real characters themselves. There aren't many composers that can match the intensity that Nolan wants behind and in front of the camera, but Zimmer definitely does.From Tom Hardy's almost dialogue-less performance, to the breathtaking cinematography from Hoyte van Hoytema, and the incredible work done by Hans Zimmer, Dunkirk is a film which sees Christopher Nolan at the top of his craft. It's the shortest film of his since 'Following' but it may very well be his most emotionally effective film, and that's without developing any characters. Every year I'm hoping to see movies that change the way cinema is made and viewed, Nolan is one of the few directors that constantly break new ground in Hollywood. As much as Dunkirk isn't what I thought it would be, I can't ask for anything more than for him to reinvent the genre.+Score+Non-linear structure+Mind-blowingly gorgeous visuals+The best air-force sequences ever from a war film10/10",10,6,16,24 July 2017
The Intouchables," A Feel Good Film For the Ages
","Normally when I'm watching a foreign film with subtitles, it can be distracting. With The Intouchables, you never once even realize it has subtitles. It's by far one of the most charming films I have ever seen. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is incredible. It is hard to even come up with an issue with the film from top to bottom.It tells the story of an ex-con upbeat young man who is hired by a quadriplegic to be his caretaker and the bond they build over time. They both learn life lessons from each other but most of all they both enjoy life for what it is. Cluzet brings so much joy to a character who is in an unbearable situation. Sy learns to love the little things in life while developing a special bond with Cluzet and the rest of his aristocratic family. I do wish they showed a bit about how Sy rekindled his own family relationship or just stayed true to the real life story. I don't know exactly to what extent this film is fiction but that seemed to be the big complaint among critics.For me, it doesn't need to be a history lesson. A film is suppose to move you emotionally. Whether it's a comedy, thriller, or drama a film is to entertain. So I enjoyed the film for what it is, and that's a feel good film. The performances, music, and directing are all great and it's just a well made film.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Cuarón Brings a More Mature, Stylistic Approach to the Series
","As the trio gets older the films become a little darker and more mature. Watching the Harry Potter series within days of each other can be a tough adjustment. Especially considering how family friendly the first two installments are, but no matter the subtitle, Harry Potter films always maintain that fun atmosphere.Harry and his buddies have turned 13, his first year of his teens, and this film subtly tackles some common issues that an early teen has. Not only is Harry dealing with the angst of trying to be independent from his muggle family, but he then is forced with coming to terms with an estranged family member returning to find Harry, Sirius Black. All the films have relatively the same setting, characters, and tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is clearly a part of a maturation process for Harry. There's something to be said for a film that takes its franchise in a totally new direction (i.e. Fast Five), but I also can't help but think this film was missing a few familiar plot points.Alfonso Cuarón took the reigns from Chris Columbus and he brought a refreshing take on the Potterverse. Just by simply looking at the advancement of technology in CGI and in the unique camera movements/shots, this was going to be a different Potter film. Cuarón brought along Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore, after the unfortunate passing of Richard Harris. As great as Harris is, his calming presence may not have worked as Dumbledore here. Gambon fits in well as a more demanding and mysterious headmaster than in the previous two films.With that said, Voldemort's lack of presence is definitely felt. I enjoy the late-game twist in the film's villain and I understand we don't necessarily need him every film, but there was barely any mention of him. Yes, that's the way it is in the book, but for me, it degrades the score a bit. The focus here is more on Sirius Black and Professor Lupin. Both of which have unexpected twists and turns that make the third act quite the whirlwind. To me, this film plays more as a part 1 of 2 to the Goblet of Fire, because we only get a glimpse into Pettigrew and his relation to the dark lord and Harry's parents. Either way, Prisoner of Azkaban is a welcomed changeup in the film's franchise and one that, on repeat viewings, only gets better. I mean, who doesn't love time travel, Hippogriff's, a long awaited punch, a little quality time with Harry & Hermione, and one big twist right? It's a slower pace and a darker tone, but Prisoner of Azkaban is no slouch of a film.+ Cuarón's different style+Gary Oldman enters the picture+Fantastic visuals/cinematography+Hermione & Harry team-up-No Voldemort presence8.7/10",8,1,5,6 November 2016
Aliens," This Time It's War
","One of the reasons I'm still clinging onto hope that the Avatar franchise isn't a one-hit wonder is because James Cameron has proved how well he can build out a world in a sequel. He did it with Terminator and he certainly did it with Aliens. It's not only a great sci-fi thriller, but it's easily one of the greatest action films to date.With a much bigger budget and story, Aliens takes everything that was great with Alien, and doubles down on it. All while at the same time building his own world of Alien mythology that seems similar and different enough from Ridley Scott's film to succeed as a sequel and stand on its own. It's a hard thing to do, but amazingly Aliens does it. What's great about this adventure is that we know what to expect with the Xenomorphs. We know that these explorers and military personnel are in for a rude awakening when they reach the colony, but the film takes us on the journey anyway. Everything is avoidable, but yet, all of the character decisions feel logical anyway.It's pretty amazing what 7 years can do to special effects and production designs. While Alien was very contained and simplistic, Aliens is just the opposite, bold with a massive scope. It's a testament to making films with real effects and minimal green screen and CGI, because films (and these in particular) are always scarier and more thrilling when everything feels real. In fact, you feel like you're going on this journey right alongside the crew, experiencing each gun shot and face-hugging with them. In this regard, Aliens plays as both a harrowing western, and an electrifying video game for the audience. That speaks to Cameron's masterful directing.Cameron also manages to write and direct Ripley into one of the most recognizable action stars in film history. She wasn't granted a ton of action in the first film, and fittingly so, but Aliens turns a warrant officer into the queen of all things Xenomorphs. Which brings me to the theme of the film, which seems to be motherhood. It's a nice twist on gender stereotypes and harsh look into the struggle of a 'woman's voice' in society. Ripley is questioned at every turn by most of the characters, even though she clearly has the most experience out of anyone. And I love how Cameron parallels Ripley with the 'Alien Queen' at the end. Both of them trying their hardest to save their 'children'. Aliens, much like Alien, is the perfect example of how to max-out the quality of your film in every aspect. Everything from the intense score, the gorgeous production design, the endless tension, and unique and memorable performances. Aliens is quite simply, one of the greatest films ever made.+New take from Cameron+Tension+Ripley is now an action icon+Bigger scope10/10",10,5,7,17 May 2017
The Fast and the Furious," A Guilty Pleasure Movie at its Finest
","16 years and 7 films ago the Fast & Furious franchise wasn't the worldwide phenomena that it is now. It was once a cheesy Point Break rip-off that took itself way too seriously. But you know what, it was a darn good guilty pleasure movie. That's for sure.A lot has changed over the years in the series, but the one constant has always been that the films are about family. For all its faults, no one can deny how well this film does the family angle. It's not the best acting, writing, or directing, but you care enough about the characters to where you believe the motivations behind characters' actions regarding family. But let's talk about how ridiculous, stupid, and fun this movie is.They drive their cars (successfully) underneath semi-trucks several times throughout the film. So much so that when I was younger I believed it was possible. That word, 'possible', will be used sparingly through the course of this film and the entire series. Where Furious 7 pushes the boundaries of reality by driving cars via one building to the next, The Fast and the Furious provides the unbelievable through street car races with seemingly a few hundred people. In the middle of the night, that is. Oh and those hundreds of people each have their own car and parking spot, that is. But that won't be the last time the film could have you roll your eyes.In fact, it's way easier to watch this film now that I've seen every installment to date. This film is extremely dated, but it's an interesting watch, especially considering where the series has gone to now. There's an underground motorcycle gang who steals DVD players and stashes them in a Thai-food restaurant. The climax of the film begins at an event called Race Wars. Creative huh? At one point, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) tells someone to back off or she will scar her face with tire tracks. I guess my point is, if you don't accept the film for what it is, I don't think you'll have any fun with it.The real joy of this film comes by its goofiest and most outlandish moments, but also with its impressive stunts and action. In camera stunts may be this franchise's finest assets, and the last highway heist in this film is a thing of beauty. Yes, the film gets bogged down by a really dated and contrived script, but there's so much undeniable fun to be had here.

X-Men: Days of Future Past," The Perfect X-Men Movie
","Out of all the major superhero franchises we have today, the X-Men franchise has been the weakest in my opinion. I like the original two X-men films, First Class, and The Wolverine a lot. But in terms of the best overall franchise, it has never blown me away like other superhero movies had. But Days of Future Past is everything I had hoped and more. It brings together the original cast, and the younger cast from First Class together in one big epic movie. It also happens to introduce a few new mutants to the big screen that turned out to be more than impressive.Right from the opening scene, you realize the franchise is back in Bryan Singer's hands who helmed the first two critically acclaimed X-men films. Literally the first 10 minutes show us the unique powers of some of the lesser known mutants such as Blink, Sunspot, and Bishop. Everyone's introduction was spot on and brings back the chills I had when first seeing X-men. The film then starts to set in motion the plans to send Wolverine's consciousness back in time to his younger self in order to stop Mystique from killing Boliver Trask. Jennifer Lawrence was great as both Raven and Mystique as you can tell she struggles to cope with everything bad that has happened to mutants the years following the Cuban crisis.James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender once again shine as Charles Xavier and Magneto respectively. The two old friends go through many more ups and downs this go around, and you can tell how much more comfortable these actors felt in their roles. Ultimately this film is about hope, and which of the mutants can overcome their hatred and restore hope within the mutant community and together with humans.Even though Hugh Jackman is once again the star of the movie, it's hard not to think about how good everyone else is in the movie. Evan Peters, as Quicksilver, who everyone including myself were bashing on how bad he looked in the trailers, was hilariously awesome in this movie. He had probably some of the best scenes of the entire movie by himself. Overall I loved this movie and it is by far my favorite X-men film, and one of the best superhero movies of all time.I have to also mention the brief cameos of Cyclops and Jean Grey.

","Now that is how you make a superhero film. After 12 films, it seemed unlikely the Marvel universe could create something so refreshing and new, but Civil War does just that. It's impeccably paced, exhilarating, heartbreaking, and just outright fun. Captain America Civil War is one of the greatest superhero films to be put to the big screen.Civil War sees the return of most of the usual suspects from the Marvel films, with the exception of Thor and Hulk, and sets the universe in a new direction while also honoring what came before it. The Captain America 'trilogy' should be considered the most unique trilogy of all time. Although, for all intents and purposes, this film is essentially Avengers 3. Yes, the story is always focused on Cap and Bucky, but it is just as much a Marvel Universe film as a story about two best friends from Brooklyn.The Russo Brothers are thankfully back after Winter Soldier and they pulled off the impossible with Civil War. There are so many characters, plot-lines, and things that need to be set up, and it's handled wonderfully. But they also direct action maybe better than anyone in Hollywood right now. Much like Winter Soldier, the action in Civil War always hits at just the right time. The airport scene will go down as one of the greatest superhero fight sequences of all time.Newcomers Black Panther and Spider-Man were brought along and implanted seamlessly. Chadwick Boseman and Tom Holland play the two characters brilliantly and instantly get me excited to see their solo films within the next few years.Each character gets their time to shine. Scarlet Witch is fully realized and Ant-Man, Falcon, and Vision bring the witty Marvel one- liners that they have become known for. As much as this film is deeply rooted in psychological emotion and tough character choices, it still retains the humor that keeps the film from ever reaching grim areas. It really puts to question, how much better can superhero films get?I haven't even mention Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Bucky/Winter Soldier who all get incredible moments. Does anybody not have confidence that the Russo brothers can balance 60 something characters in Infinity War in a few years? Overall, the Marvel Universe and superhero films in general, have a new level of greatness to live up to. Perhaps more time will give me perspective, but for now, Civil War is my new favorite Marvel film.+You understand both sides of the coin+That Airport scene+Builds on what came before, and sends the universe in a refreshing direction+Still a focus on Cap and Bucky+Black Panther and Spider-Man steal the show+Maintains the fun tone amidst an immensely emotion film.10/10",10,7,17,5 May 2016
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," No Heart or Imagination
","It's always tough for a reboot or a reimagining of a franchise to win over the hearts of all viewers. The Harry Potter films were this generation's Star Wars. It was always going to be an uphill battle for Fantastic Beasts and in my opinion, the film never even got off the ground. With no heart, weak visual effects, and surprisingly little imagination, Fantastic Beasts and How to Get Bored turns out the most disappointing film going experience of this year.I'm going to try and not compare the film too much to its predecessors, because that's ultimately unfair. This was a new thing. There are only a few little references here and there to characters we knew. After all, this film takes place 70 years before Harry entered Hogwarts. With that said, I'm not sure what the appeal here is without an attachment to the series. Sure, J.K. Rowling comes back and makes her screen writing debut, but the script felt so basic and unimaginative. Aside from some nicely time physical humor, this was a sloppily paced missed opportunity.Our new wizard team comprised of talented actors Eddie Redmayne, Katherine Waterson, Dan Fogler, and Alison Sudol. I'm not sure if it was because the youth and innocence is no longer there (like with the original team at Hogwarts), but I didn't care at all for the team. Fogler, who plays Kowalski, has some great (and I mean great) comedic moments, but I didn't find anything compelling or charismatic about this particular group. Unfortunately, Redmayne gets lost in his obscure quirkiness (as does Ezra Miller for that matter), and Colin Farrell's Graves' character was criminally underused.Speaking of Farrell, I have no idea why he would want to take on such a role. The third act reveals that Farrell is actually the dangerous wizard, Grindelwald undercover. Of course, none other than Johnny Depp himself was officially cast as Grindelwald a few weeks ago for the upcoming films. Why in the world get such a talented actor in Farrell if you're just going to switch him to another famous actor the next second? It just seemed like a waste to me.I hope other people found enjoyment in this film, because I certainly did not. But hey, I still have faith that a sequel could be good. 5 movies? I'm not so sure about, but I wouldn't mind seeing another one of these films. Coming from a big Potter film fan, this was a massive disappointment.+Kowalski provided some entertainment-Farrell wasted-No real heart-The new team is uninteresting and lacks charisma-Surprisingly mediocre CGI4.0/10",4,6,10,2 December 2016
The Conjuring 2," Valak's Awakening
","The thing I like about both Conjuring films is that as much as the films present us with terrifying demons and creatures, it's always been about the Warrens. Ed and Lorraine are the center of the stories even when the focus seems to be elsewhere. Conjuring 2 feels about 35 minutes too long, with a first act that significantly drags, but when it gets going, it sure gets going. This time around the Warrens head to Enfield, London to investigate claims of a poltergeist terrorizing a young girl, Janet, in her family's home. The first hour deals with the family going through it with their own team of London paranormal investigators before it finally reaches the Warrens. Meanwhile, the Warrens, and specifically Lorraine, had the Nun to deal with before heading over. The good thing about these films is that there isn't the cliched 'no one can see the demon but the person being possessed'. The Conjuring 2 comes right out and declares that this particular demon, Valak, isn't hiding his presence. Much like the first film, it comes down to the religious angle of it all, which I could give or take. But I do appreciate the attention to detail, the lack of cliches, and the gorgeous cinematography. While not being nearly as tightly directed as the first, James Wan still has something here and hopefully continues to for years to come.'7.7/10",7,1,2,23 September 2018
Jackie," A Complete Transformation By Portman
","Natalie Portman may very well win her second Oscar at the age of 35, which has to be close to the age Meryl Streep won her second. Her performance in Jackie is astounding and completely transforming. The movie as a whole is solid, but Portman is the biggest reason to see this in theaters.Similar to Steve Jobs & Carol last year, Pablo Larraín used 16mm and 35mm film to transport you back to the 60's and give it that grainy stylish feel. And much like those aforementioned films, you are most certainly taken back to that time period. The movie isn't flawless but it succeeds immensely in Larraín's ability to establish the right production design, costumes, dialogue, and cinematography for that time period.But let's talk about Portman. Sure, she's incredible in Black Swan and everyone loves her in her debut, Leon The Professional among other things, but she's not always the actress I gravitate towards when deciding to watch a movie or not. But Jackie once again establishes her as one of the best actresses working today. The way she commits to Jackie Kennedy's voice and mannerisms is unprecedented. That wasn't Natalie Portman acting, that was Jackie Kennedy. This film focuses solely on her husband's assassination and the events directly following, but it's absolutely Jackie's story. The whole movie rests on Portman's shoulders, and she delivers.I think my only flaw I had was that at one point the film decides to take a graphically unnecessary approach to the real-life events. It's one thing if the whole film had taken that approach, but it doesn't. It's a relatively calm film, and they all of a sudden throw in some gratuitous gore. I had already felt Jackie's grief and sorrow, & was already invested in every scene up until that point. I didn't need to be shown The President's head be in pieces to be present in the car with Jackie.Other than that, this is world class acting on display. Portman never veers into an over-the-top performance, which can happen with biopics, and the film is tightly written and directed. It knew what it wanted to tell and it succeeded in doing so. As much as I would love to see Emma Stone or Amy Adams take home the hardware, I think this is once again Portman's year.+Complete transformation from Portman+Larraín's visual aesthetic+Poignancy-Slightly gratuitous scene8.3/10",8,1,6,7 January 2017
No Strings Attached," Unfairly Criticized
","I'm a huge fan of the Mila Kunis/Justin Timberlake lead 'Friends With Benefits' which is probably the reason why I held off for so many years with 'No Strings Attached', released the very same year. Both plots are eerily similar but just like every other genre, if you succeed in using a similar formula, then what does it really matter? And technically this film came before 'Friends With Benefits'. Natalie Portman, who has truly become one of the greatest actors of this generation (and she's still under 40!), has great chemistry with fellow lead Ashton Kutcher, who expectedly begin to fall for each other after years of friendship. Much like the previously mentioned 'Friends With Benefits', the film is rounded out with a great cast of supporting actors, Greta Gerwig, Jake Johnson, Lake Bell, Ludacris, Mindy Kaling, and Kevin Kline. It's nothing earth-shattering, but the film is a good time nonetheless.7.8/10",7,0,0,6 October 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Bonkers
","It's crazy to think about how many Hollywood stars were in Scott Pilgrim just before they really stepped into their primes as actors. This was a year before Chris Evans played Captain America for the first time, Aubrey Plaza had just begun Parks and Rec, Anna Kendrick was just nominated for an Academy Award that year, Brie Larson hadn't done Room or Short Term 12 yet, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead was finally getting cast in bigger budgeted films. Knowing all of that now, makes going back and watching the film a little bit more fun than it probably should, though it is certainly an entertaining film on its own. That's putting it mildly. For all intents and purposes, Scott Pilgrim is a balls to the wall bonkers comic book adaptation, the kind of film that almost certainly inspired Tim Miller when he adapted Deadpool years later, just purely for its irreverent humor mixed with a heartfelt romance. And much like Deadpool, you either buy into the stylistic choices early on, or you don't. Admittedly, the style does tend to wear off towards the end of it's nearly 2 hour runtime, but I nonetheless had a great time.7.8/10",7,0,0,18 March 2019
Inside Out," Sweet Emotion
","It's incredibly difficult to find a film that legitimately succeeds in making you feel all the emotions that it sets out to. I don't think there was a moment in the film where I thought that the film missed on a joke or any of the emotional moments throughout. Quite often you will see a film miss on something, but Inside Out hit on all levels. Quite simply Inside Out is not only a return to form for Pixar, but one of their most imaginative and groundbreaking films. It's up there with Finding Nemo and the Toy Story films as one of my favorites.It tells the story of young Riley, who is forced into a new move from Minnesota to San Francisco and her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger struggle with the best possible way to treat all the various obstacles that go with a new move. For starters, Riley isn't the prototypical lead girl, she plays hockey, (not to mention that her teeth are not perfectly straight) which you don't often see with a Hollywood picture, and she's just generally an awkward kid. I think this created a much more naturally complicated story of not being able to fit in. I really enjoyed the family aspect of the film. Both the bonding that the emotions do to ultimately become closer, and the presence of Riley's parents. It's one of the first Pixar films that I can remember where we have both parents actually there for the main characters conflicts, and it worked really well. Sometimes it worked to the point where I got teary eyed, which is not abnormal for a Pixar film. But what I thought was more impressive is that the film never relied on something that was overly emotional to bring us to tears. Where Up, Toy Story 3, and Finding Nemo have more dramatic moments, Inside Out is simply about a normal conflict in a little girls path to growing up and moving on. But yet, there were at least 3 moments tear jerker worthy.Much like other Pixar films, I think everyone can get something out of the film at different points in their life. As fun as it is for little kids to watch Joy and Sadness going on an adventure to save Riley's emotional state, it can be equally as interesting for adults to understand what the brain of a pre-teen girl looks like. After all, the director Pete Doctor stated that the film was conceptualized based on his inability to understand his daughter's thoughts. Not only is the story appealing to multiple generations, but they enter into the minds out other people of various ages and demographics throughout the film to create some of the funniest moments in the film. Whether it was the dinner table conversation between parents or when a boy meets Riley and his emotions go bonkers, the film nails emotions on so many levels. This film is so inventive in creating a beautiful world where we can not only potentially learn something about ourselves, but have fun doing it.In addition to having a wonderful story about moving on and accepting change, Inside Out contains some of the coolest Easter eggs and references any Pixar film has to offer. Who thought we would get a Chinatown reference in a kids movie? Or hidden Hitchcock posters in 'Dream Studios', which is also equally as funny as it is a nod to how impeccably true it is of Hollywood. Or what about those barely noticeable newspapers that Anger was reading? Or how can I forget the brilliant voice cast led by Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. And of course the now veteran Pixar composer Michael Giacchino who gave us yet another beautifully emotional score. Inside Out is one of the most fun summer films and quite possibly best of the year so far. It's near a lock to win best animated feature and a likely candidate for best picture come February. I was beyond impressed by Inside Out.+Hilarious and touching +Giacchino's score +Hidden Easter eggs +Perfect voice cast +Every generation can get something out of it +The kid isn't clichéd at all +Family dynamic 9.4/10",9,11,35,21 June 2015
Yesterday," The Romance This Summer Needed
","When done right, rom-com-drama's (especially ones with a music backdrop) are some of my favorite films of all time. 'Yesterday' posed a creative premise, as the world has forgotten The Beatles (among many other pop culture things) and one musician decides to take advantage of that and take credit for the songs as his own. It's a premise that almost begs you not to root for the main character, played by Himesh patel. But Patel contains great charisma and shares a natural chemistry with Lily James. Admittedly some of the rom-com elements feel dated and towards the end of the movie, a little bit unearned, but there's something truly special about hearing The Beatles iconic music on screen amidst a charming love story, something we've been missing this summer.7.7/10",7,0,1,9 July 2019
Resident Evil," Throwback Action-Horror
","Video game movies have been awful for decades now. Resident Evil isn't necessarily the exception to that rule, but it's nowhere near as awful as the genre has been.Resident Evil is at its best when it pushes aside the politics of this 'secret military group' named The Umbrella, and instead is an homage to the original Alien. When the film takes twists and turns that are supposed to surprise you, when in fact, they feel like a weak attempt at shock, it becomes overwhelmingly convoluted. But in the instances that the survivors, led by Alice (Milla Jovovich), are scrambling through rooms doing anything to survive CGI creatures and flesh eating zombies, Resident Evil is pure guilty pleasure.Much like the Underworld franchise, I honestly don't care about any of the supporting characters. Knowing where most zombie flicks go, there's really no use to getting attached to secondary characters when you know their deaths are all but guaranteed. I did, however, find Alice to be compelling, as long as the sequels do more to expand her history and explain how she became an absolute bada**. In fact, one can make the argument that Alice is a more likable character than Selene is in Underworld.As I've said a lot recently, there's nothing wrong with a mindless action adventure if it doesn't take itself too seriously. Resident Evil is actually a pretty serious film, people are dying left and right, and the world is on the brink of an apocalypse. But there's something to be said about a throwback action-horror taking place in one confined space. In this case, it gives the viewer a sense of what a first person shooter game with this story would feel like. I've never played any of the games, but I can certainly see where this story lends itself to the video game medium. Now, is there an excuse for a horrendous looking creature via CGI? Or maybe some truly useless characters with weak (at best) dialogue? No, I can't say there is. But hey, it's a solid cable watch.+Action that doesn't pull punches+Alice is likable-Dated CGI-Inexcusably bad dialogue5.8/10",5,0,2,19 January 2017
Avengers: Endgame," Part of the Journey is the End
","What's funny about Endgame is that it's actually the first Avengers movie where they do in fact 'Avenge'. After the Thanos snap, half the population of the universe disappeared and thus creating the biggest problem the team has ever had to fix. Luckily, Scott and Tony figured out a way to time travel, to undo the snap and attempt to bring back all the people they lost.It's tough to comprehend just how good this film is. On one hand, I do have some minor issues with the middle act as well as questions about all this time travel and the lack of ramifications. However, on the other hand, (and I hate making this as an excuse) but it is a superhero movie after all. How much do you forgive a plot hole here or there? The answer lies with how well you like the 3rd act. Because I do believe the last 45 minutes is some of the best film ever put to screen. The amount of pay-off and satisfaction you get as all 22 films have led to that moment is something I will never forget. I've seen the film twice now, and I nearly teared up merely seeing the portals open, among about 10 other small moments that moved me as well.Of course the MCU will go on and make more billions upon billions as the universe continues to expand, but it won't be the same. We'll never get another core Avengers movie with this cast, and no matter how much or little your invested in the MCU, that has to mean something to you. It made the middle act worth it when the heroes go back and have to relive certain events that we've seen play out in other MCU films. But naturally, that act of the film does play out slower and more plotting than anything else. You certainly feel the lack of Thanos during those sequences. And I think that was my biggest gripe, the antagonist (Thanos) is only really there in the beginning and end, so you never feel true danger that our heroes aren't going to recover the stones for use one more time.With that said, I think the original crew truly give us their best performances yet, and that starts with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., the heart and soul of this series. I'll admit I did not expect them to kill off only Tony and keep Steve alive, but their arcs are almost perfectly capped off here. Pepper says it perfectly to Tony 'We're going to be alright, you can rest now'.There's not a whole lot to this review, it' mostly just initial thoughts, but if I can stress one thing over anything else, it's thank you. Thank you to Kevin Feige, the Russo Bros, and everyone involved in making this and the other MCU films. It's been one of the greatest pleasures of my life seeing this universe unfold the way it has and it's hard to imagine not having the next phase of films already in the pipeline but Endgame puts a stamp on the end of this series like not other. This was something special, and I don't think we'll ever see it again.10/10",10,141,268,28 April 2019
Quantum of Solace," Path of Revenge
","In between two of the greatest Bond films of all time, Quantum of Solace returns back to the formula of several Bond films except for the fact that the story line pretty much carries over from Casino Royale. This time Bond is out for revenge against the people who killed his one love, Vesper. By no means is this a great film, in fact, it's surprisingly uneventful. But I think the film gets a worse rap than it should because it's in between Casino Royale and Skyfall. I found it crazy how much I didn't remember about this film. But I did remember how much it shares with The Living Daylights of 20 years prior. In both films Bond goes borderline Rogue from MI6 due to a loss of a loved one. The difference is The Living Daylights is far more exciting and better paced than Quantum. Solace is nearly 40 minutes shorter than the other Craig films which smells like late game editing to me. I'm not saying it would be good if it were longer but I do think we would care more about the supporting characters. I think that was my main issue with this film, it's really Craig and everyone else here. I think it's a combination of lackluster performances and writing.Bond goes on a so called 'killing spree' throughout the film, or rather everyone that comes close to him dies as he goes after Dominic Greene, the leader of a mysterious organization set to eliminate Bolivia's water supply. A weird motivation for a Bond villain, but it's never the endgame that matters, it's the performance of the actor that really counts. With that said, I never found Mathieu Amalric's performance to all that intriguing. It's disappointing considering the incredible villains of Casino Royale and Skyfall. As I'm writing this I feel like I dislike the film increasingly more thinking about it as I gather my final thoughts. I'm trying to think of redeemable qualities especially putting it into perspective with the others in this new reboot. Perhaps the relationship between Bond and M is the best part about the film. The CGI is more noticeable and the editing with shaky cam is distracting. These films work best when they focus on story first and foremost, not the action.+Bond & M relationship blossoms.-No depth-Uninteresting supporting characters-Too short-Weak villain4.5/10",4,1,5,5 November 2015
Independence Day," Welcome to Earth
","1996 was a vastly different time for big time blockbusters. Independence Day is easily one of the most famous end-of-the-world blockbusters, but sadly, 20 years later, it doesn't necessarily hold up. With painfully cheesy one-liners and one-too many characters to follow, it's a less than stellar take on the alien invasion genre.One thing that does stand out is the ensemble cast. Perhaps besides Harvey Fierstein, I really enjoyed the entire cast. With a powerhouse like Will Smith bringing the charisma and most of the film's comedy, all you need is some solid supporting cast members to carry the rest of the weight, although let's face it, Jeff Goldblum plays the exact same character he does in Jurassic Park. Having said that, there are far too many characters that feel entirely unnecessary and end up bloating the film to an hour and a half. Cut half of the supporting roles and 30min of screen time and you have a much more re-watchable film.I can't entirely blame the film for having dated special effects, especially since it won an Oscar for them. However, I can blame the film for having a script and direction that doesn't seem to care enough to develop the characters and story into a respectable blockbuster territory. Perhaps it's because we are so inundated with mega-films that do all of these things so well that I got a little upset watching Independence Day. How many times can Roland Emmerich zoom the camera in on someone giving a shocked face at the alien's ship? It happens at least 20 times within the first hour.This film definitely has its copycats, as Emmerich recently pointed out in an interview. But he took a lot from the previous sci-fi epics that came before him. Everything from the music, end credits (visually), to the space battles felt like something out of a Star Wars or Star Trek film. With that said, none of those films have as good of a speech as Bill Pullman does as he rallied the pilots before the final takedown. That's right about when I began to accept the film for what it is and forgive some of the horrifically cheesy moments.Although the film is over 140 minutes long, we never really get a sense as to the alien's motivations or backstory as to their appearance on earth, which was disappointing for sure. Why did we need to follow the kids of one of the pilots, who barely had a role, and not get a little bit more insight from the aliens point of view? These are just a few of the issues I had with the film, but really, it's mindless fun that doesn't really need to be dissected to such an extent. Overall, it's half way decent and likely better than it has any right to be.+Will Smith's ridiculous one-liners+Pullman's speech+Mindless fun-Enough with the close-ups-Too many side characters-And they are focused on way too much6.0/10",6,0,0,28 June 2016
Mamma Mia!," How Can I Resist You?
","It's really weird how the inner-workings of my brain function. Sometimes I'll be completely turned off by cheesy musicals (or cheesy films in general). Other times, I get a real joy out of watching something cheesy with earnest and intended heartfelt emotion. It's a case by case basis and depends on my mood I guess. 'Mamma Mia!' falls somewhere in between. The musical based off the broadway play, which is in turn based off music from ABBA, is outrageously silly and really lacks coherence in most parts. But it also contains endlessly catchy ABBA music and some performances that you absolutely cannot miss. And not necessarily great performances, more like actors you can't miss doing stupid-cheesy-musical stuff.The last paragraph is hardly written well, and that tends to fit the tone of the film. Sporadic, unexplainably and questionably sensual, colorful, with some (perhaps unintentionally) laugh out loud moments. It's not like this movie acts like it's an awards contender, although Streep was inexplicably nominated for a Globe that year (not like the Globes are the end-all be-all of award shows anyway). However, the cast is an impressive ensemble. Streep, Amanda Seyfried, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Julie Walters, Stellan Skarsgard, and Christine Baranski among others.There are some undeniably cringe worthy moments, most of which include actors or actresses who aren't musically inclined and attempt to perform a musical number. I hate to say it, but it reminded me of some cringey Disney Channel Original Movies. Which is why this movie can be a pain to watch but possibly a joy to re-watch. However, it can't be overstated how much of a soft-spot I have for ABBA's music, especially with this cheese-ball acting behind it. For that alone, I'm looking forward to the second film this summer.6.0/10",6,0,0,21 January 2018
Toy Story 4," 'To Infinity.... And Beyond'
","I was always excited but hesitant for Toy Story 4. It felt largely unnecessary but intriguing. Other than wanting a boat load of money, why would Disney/Pixar want to go back to what may be the greatest trilogy of all time and take a chance at messing it up? Well, your answer is they wanted to close Woody's arc in the best possible way. Mirroring his story with Buzz in the first Toy Story with his new relationship with 'Forky', the Spork turned toy, Woody very well may have the best arc in cinema history. Or perhaps the most complete and full circle story. But the film is still very funny, introduces us to plenty of new memorable characters, and is directed/written as well as the best of Pixar's films. They even made Bo Peep incredibly cool. If it wasn't for HTTYD 3 earlier this year, I would say Pixar has the Oscar locked up.9.7/10",9,27,50,22 June 2019
Batman Begins," Become The Fear
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Batman Begins is the film that really brought back the superhero genre. Sure the X-Men films were darker and more realistic than previous comic book films but Batman Begins brought a whole new audience back to theaters. It's my least favorite of the trilogy but believe it or not it's still in my top 10 favorite films of all time. It's a brilliant origin story that gave us the beginnings of the greatest trilogy of all time, in my opinion. And without this film we wouldn't have had Inception. Christopher Nolan made these smart superhero films in order to gain studio trust to create his own ideas like Inception and Interstellar.For how great The Joker and Bane are in this trilogy it's Ra's Al Ghul that gets overlooked the most. Liam Neeson is at his best and gave Ra's depth. He's truly terrifying because he's the type of villain that believes what he's doing is actually good for people and he's not the typical twirl your mustache evil villain. That's what this film and the trilogy did so well, it gave layers to each of it's characters and is by far the most intelligent superhero franchise.What's fascinating is that you don't see Batman until nearly an hour in, but it's not less intense because of it. It's beautifully written and paced so that audiences are on the edge of their seats even without anything really happening on screen. It be wrong not to mention Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow as it was the first time he put on the mask. They perfectly brought Scarecrow from the comic book pages to the big screen without making his character seem too comic-booky. Batman villains are hard to make appealing to a mass audience but Christopher Nolan perfected it.Rachel was perhaps miscast and I may be one of the few people who actually prefer Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance over Katie Holmes any day. But she is serviceable for being a completely made up character. It's fascinating to watch Bruce' struggle to overcome his fear and his haunting tragic past. It's even better going back and watching the film after you have seen the entire trilogy because of how many things tie into each other. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine were great in the supporting roles and Christian Bale truly shined.So in all Batman Begins may be the worst of the trilogy but still a masterpiece of a film. It brought back the genre in a way previous films failed. It gave us the most realistic look at a character who most thought could only thrive on the pages of comic books. After all who could forget the easter egg at the end? +Brought back the genre+Paved the way for Nolan's forthcoming films +Dark, gritty, and realistic +Well acted film all around +Hans Zimmer's score!!! +Ending easter egg 10/10",10,2,3,5 November 2014
The Fault in Our Stars," Lives Up to the Hype, and Bring Your Tissues
","I think in terms of being able to portray real emotion on screen and capture the perfect amount of sadness with just one face, there is no one better in Hollywood than Shailene Woodley. Whether it's the one short scene in Divergent or the near 10 scenes in this movie, she is perfect at crying. And for the most part, the entire cast executes as well. Ansel Elgort was surprisingly great as the cocky but truly caring Augustus Waters. Laura Dern perhaps had one of the best performances of her career and even Sam Trammel, Nat Wolff and Willem Dafoe shined in their small but significant roles. As much sadness as this movie will bring to people, especially those who have had or know somebody who has had cancer, it can also be very uplifting.From what I hear, the movie is nearly a perfect transition from book to film, and I can say there isn't much they could have done better. It does take awhile for the emotional scenes to hit, but when they do it's hard to hold back the tears. Also, i really liked how the trailers gave us the gist of the story without showing too much. I was surprised a few times with where the story went, and I compliment 20th Century Fox for giving us a great marketing campaign.The chemistry within the entire cast was impeccable. If i'm comparing it to Spectacular Now, I would say this movie has the edge in balancing emotion with slight humor, and even being more gutsy. As Shailene Woodley said, there aren't many movie posters that show a beautiful girl using an Oxygen Tank. They very easily could have taken Shailene Woodley and Elgort and just left out any signs of cancer. Woodley has a bright future and if she keeps choosing her roles wisely, then she will one day hold an Oscar.Like I said there are roughly 8-10 scenes where you may cry, and for a film to do that and still manage to be uplifting at the same time is quite the accomplishment. It's one of my favorite movies of the year so far, and for the performances and near perfect directing it should be seen in theaters.+Woodley is getting better and better +Emotional scenes hit the exact right amount of times +Few surprises +Depressing, but still manages to be uplifting at the same time.9.6/10",9,1,5,7 June 2014
The Princess Bride," A Timeless Adventure
","So, I really only watched this movie when I did to prepare for Once Upon a Deadpool, but I'm glad I finally came around to watching one of the classic fantasy-adventure films of the last century. Earnest and honestly funny, The Princess Bride captured my imagination (even at 24) for an hour and a half of pure joy and spectacle, even if the film is pretty dated by most 1987 standards. I don't think anyone can say the film isn't completely cheeseball at times with some of the dialogue and performances, but I'll take that sword fight between Westley and Inigo any day of the week. That, the timeless performances from Andre the Giant, a classic romance, and one hell of a revenge story with Inigo, and you have the adventure that is, The Princess Bride.8.0/10",8,1,2,19 December 2018
How to Train Your Dragon 2," The Heart of a Chief and the Soul of a Dragon
","Animated sequels tend to struggle capturing the same broad appeal as the original, but in the case of How to Train Your Dragon 2, that's completely off. The first How to Train Your Dragon is one of my favorite movies of all time, and the sequel was my 4th most anticipated 2014 movie, so it had a lot to live up to. My initial thought was did it live up to the hype? Yes, and quite frankly it was a great time at the movies. Is it as good as the original? I would have to watch it again, but I think they are two very different movies but if I had to choose I would say the original is a tad better. With that said this movie does certain things better.The animation always looks beautiful, as all the flight scenes are absolutely amazing to watch unfold. The beginning journey with Toothless and Hiccup is stunning and instantly brought me back to the 'Test Drive' scene in the first film. The relationship between them is cute and of course is similar to a man and his dog. The introduction of Cate Blanchett as the mom was a nice touch, and answered some questions left open from the first. But it still kills me to think of Berk without Stoick at the helm. I have always loved Stoick and Hiccup's relationship because it brings a new flavor to the clichéd Hollywood parent-kid relationship.The film also brings many laughs, most come from the supporting riders to Hiccup, led by Jonah Hill and Kristen Wiig lending their voices. Even with all the entertainment, I do think the middle part of the film drags a bit. The first film flies by the 100 minute runtime without loss of steam. You can feel the runtime this go around but the ending 25 minutes delivers both on the emotional and action packed side. I also think the villain, Drago, was underwhelming but did have his moments. Kit Harrington as Eret was near useless, but once again, had his moments.I cant go this whole review without mentioning the true heroes of both movies, and that is John Powell and Jonsi. They both do a great job at capturing the locations, and the relationships between the Vikings and Dragons. This film while not as good overall on the score side does bring back all of the same themes. I will be as excited for the third and possibly last installment as much as this one. This film also does a lot to set up the third and any future installments. These are the animated movies that make Pixar step their game up. Not many films can do that. The score is hair raising, and the song by Jonsi is incredibly beautiful to cap the film off. It will take a few more viewings to truly decide my score, but I will go with my gut feeling as I did for the first film.+Hiccup and Toothless together :) +Beautifully spotless animation +Once again another beautiful score/soundtrack +Emotional moments are almost at Toy Story 3 level +Sets the 3rd installment up -Sometimes weak villains -Drags a tad 9.6/10",9,4,9,13 June 2014
The Pianist," Power of Music
","I love films that glorify the power of music or even the power of movies, and what they can do for people because it's something that I have been directly impacted with. Movies and music have both gotten me through the hardest of times no matter the genre. A film has the ability to give the audience an escape route from their normal life. Now The Pianist shows this on a much different scale and exemplifies it in a different way, but I love the idea of the power of music or film so it's safe to say I really liked The Pianist.It tells the true story of a Jewish man from Warsaw Germany in the midst of World War II and the numerous life threatening struggles he went through along the countless amount of helpful and hurtful people he ran into. Adrien Brody stars as Wladyslaw Szpilman and plays him beautifully. I use that word because the film deals with the touchy subject of World War II, and in particular, the Holocaust. But there is a certain beauty to the way the film presents the subject. I especially like the way the Germans are represented, in that not all of them were as brutal as Hitler. In fact there are several generous Germans throughout that give Szpilman a hand. With that being said, it is devastating to see the hundreds of bodies you say laying in the streets of Warsaw, and without being paid really any attention. It still shocks me just how inhumane people can be to other people, and what the human race is capable of. A film like this can serve as a reminder to that, and is one of the better war films I have seen.It was also fascinating to watch the piano side of this character's story. For most of the film, he had to hold all of his emotions in while playing for people during this enduring time. The piano served as such a great juxtaposition for the terrible and beautiful side of the war. The film also looks fantastic in terms of the set pieces and the way Germany is represented. Polanski really nailed that aspect of it. It's also worth mentioning just how good Thomas Kretschmann is in his small but pivotal role. Overall, I thought The Pianist was a heartbreaking but beautiful film.+Piano juxtaposition +Set pieces +Germany is represented realistically8.5/10",8,0,0,4 August 2015
The Grand Budapest Hotel," The Cast Outshines The Overall Film
","I have only seen a few Wes Anderson films and I still haven't understood the tremendous love people give him. His style is vastly different from anything in Hollywood right now but I cant help but think of a film like Dr. Strangelove as an inspiration for Andersons career. Now obviously when I say I haven't understood the love for his films doesn't mean I don't like them. I thought Moonrise Kingdom was extremely interesting and unique, as is The Grand Budapest Hotel. But as far as a movie-going experience I just don't think his style fits my liking.With that said, I think he always gets the most out of his actors. Especially in certain comedic moments I think the performances are fantastic. The film can be outrageous at times but its when the film becomes self aware that it really shines. There's something about movies that know they can be crazy and play off of it that separate it from other movies. The film also has many dark comedic moments such as just shaking off deaths without thinking twice. Dark comedy really only works when you have actors that can sell the moment. Ralph Fiennes was perfect for Gustave and I'm sure will be considered come award season.Even though the movie is only 100 minutes long, it does drag at certain moments and I found myself drifting for a few moments. The overwhelming amount of celebrity cameos were cool but most only felt like it was just the actor acting. Owen Wilson was much too easily recognizable to my liking but Dafoe and Murray were great in the small but crucial roles. Might you ask what the point of the film was? Well it seems to be about trying to find the last remaining glimpses of hope left in humanity and Gustave was one of the few left who loved people and believed in them.+Fiennes was spectacular+how many great actors in one film?+dark comedy-drags at times-some celebrities were too easily recognizable7.5/10",7,1,4,20 June 2014
The Favourite," A Tale of Two Halves
","These type of offbeat period dramas are typically not my cup of tea. I just don't find a lot of them to be interesting subject matters but heck, I was excited for The Favourite. Not only do I love Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, but Yorgos Lanthimos' last film (The Killing of a Sacred Deer) was an insanely enjoyable near-masterpiece. But I wasn't thrilled with The Favourite. It doesn't get interesting until about an hour in, and at that point it had already almost lost me. With that said, once the turn of this movie begins, it's like a trainwreck you can't help but keep your focus on (and I mean that in terms of story, and in all the best ways). Some of the deceptively evil things Weisz and Stone do to each other's characters is a joy to watch, and the time period adds to it, for some reason. If only the entire film was that gripping.7.2/10",7,2,6,8 December 2018
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Smarter, More Daring MI Film Than We Have Seen
","Every time you watch one of the Mission Impossible films, or any action movie these days, there is a certain amount of suspension of disbelief that has to be applied while watching. With Ghost Protocol it's no different, but instead the stunts are more realistic and the action is top notch, and the result is quite possibly the best of the film series.With every MI sequel they have rightfully toned down the out-of-this-world stunt/mask pulling and gave us better effects and a more intriguing story. And even though Ghost doesn't really take the story path I would have liked to see, it does manage to give us 120 minutes of awesomeness. Tom Cruise has never been better as Ethan Hunt, and even looks younger than he did 15 years ago in the first film. The villain in Ghost isn't eye popping and really lacks the back-story that Philip Seymour Hoffman had in the previous film.This film does give us a more capable and far more interesting crew than seen in the predecessors. Simon Pegg once again shines as the tech junkie of the group and newbies Paula Patton and Jeremy Renner were more than capable of carrying the action scenes. Renner's back-story didn't hit the way I hoped but then again without Michelle Monaghan as Hunt's wife the movie wasn't going to hit the emotional territory the way MI3 did.There are a few cameos near the end that raised the hairs on my arms but nothing like a Marvel film. As long as the series continues to recruit great actors, we wont have to compare it to the much superior Bourne and Bond franchises. With the 5th film set to hit theaters in late 2016 we have a few years to wait, but if the same crew is on board than it will be worth the wait.+Burj building stunt was...just stunning +Useful crew this time around+Pure entertainment for 2 hours +Cruise better than ever -Pretty weak villain -Wanted more Monaghan 8.7/10",8,2,3,27 June 2014
Revolutionary Road," It Takes Real Guts to See the Hopelessness
","We all know the pairing of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in Titanic proved to be one of the most beloved romances in all of cinema, but if you are expecting more of the same, I would advise against watching Revolutionary Road. But the reality is, the film is very well made, and very telling of how the suburban 50's life might have been back in the day. But much like some other Oscar bait movies, Revolutionary Road is a film you definitely have to be in the right mood to enjoy, and is likely a film you wont ever want to watch again.The film begins with the two meeting in a clichéd bar setting, but we really didn't even need that. Their relationship and history with each other is easily bought into. The two have simply some of the best chemistry between love interests we have ever had in cinema, whether it be a pleasant scene, or an overly dramatic one. The film does a good job of making you feel for the couple and their struggle to continue their marriage and raise their kids while also going through difficulties with DiCaprio's job. Both characters flaws are represented and in a way that doesn't necessarily make either more likable than the other. I think it's a tribute to both of these brilliant actors that they can make each and every one of the dramatic scenes (there's a ton) feel real and natural. The film flows in a way that you know where the characters are probably heading, you just don't want to believe it just yet.The film centers on Frank's (Dicaprio) inability to want to try something new and his fear of failing. Failure never ruins someone, it's being afraid to fail that leads to their downfall. I thought that was well represented throughout the film. It's worth mentioning Michael Shannon's brief but important role in the film, and the impact that his character has on the rest of the film. To me, he served as the speaker of the audience's thoughts and opinions on these shells of human beings, for the most part. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the film enough to be noticeable, but there is an overwhelming amount of darkness and sadness that is pulled from the film. Like I said, it's a very good film, but it's just extremely difficult to watch.+Both actors chemistry +Beautiful to look at +Look inside the 50's-Sooooo dark and depressing 7.6/10",7,1,1,23 June 2015
Foxcatcher," Performances Performances Performances
","Foxcatcher is a slow burn. In fact it's a really slow paced film, but at no point was I bored. That is because I think this film may be the single best acted film of the year. It's a shame that all 3 of the leads will likely be left out come Oscar night. Not only does Steve Carell give an uncharacteristically chilling performance, but Channing Tatum is an absolute revelation.Without reading too much about this film and the stunning events that unravel, you can tell from the trailers that it's a pretty tragic tale. It's about two brothers who are world class wrestlers but are unable to make the next step to Olympic greatness without the resources needed. Here's where the ever-so-creepy John Du Pont comes in and gives them a home, wealth, and the training necessary to win gold. The question then becomes why does this man care so much about these kids to spend tremendous amounts of time and money. Well the answer is that this man is just crazy. Or just strange for that matter. Carell's voice makes the character that much more disturbing. Du Pont completely changes the way Mark Shultz (Tatum) looks at life. In a way he brainwashes all these kids to do things his way and only his way.The most understated part of this film was Mark Ruffalo. Both the writing and his delivery of the subtle lines are just impeccable. His arc is both depressing and eye opening. A man this devoted and this engraved in his craft should never have to go through some of that stuff. With that being said I don't think anyone goes through more than Tatum's character. There is a particular scene where he is freaking out in his hotel room and pretty much hitting rock bottom. That's when I saw the once joke of an actor turn into an Academy Award level performer. You can see his dedication to this role in the pain he puts himself through in just that scene alone.Sure, the film can be a really slow freight train at times but it's material gets more interesting as the film progresses. And the performances are just perfect all around.+Tatum is a revelation +Carell's transformation +Ruffalo's understated performance +Direction & writing -Can be really slow at times 8.1/10",8,3,9,31 December 2014
28 Days Later...," Beautiful Wasteland
","Never being a horror fan, I'm always hesitant on watching that genre of filmmaking. It's not because I don't think they make for good cinema, they certainly do. But in most horror films that I have seen, they don't give me much more than a few scares and jumps. But 28 Days Later is a much different story. It's ability to balance the frightening movements of zombies with the beautiful imagery of a world without people. It's the scenes with simple and quiet shots of wastelands that haunt me more than the zombies themselves.We begin with seeing experiments on apes, because of course humans cant be at fault for the virus. But in reality they are. It was an accidental spread from humans. As creepy as the opening scene was, I didn't find it to be paid off in any way throughout the film. I just felt like that could have been explained in a voice-over or monologue. No matter, we then find our lead character, Jim, played by the brilliant Cillian Murphy. He of course is clueless about the outbreak as he has been in a coma for 28 days. The initial shots of him walking through Cambridge with no one to be seen were both gorgeous and haunting. Much like in I Am Legend, we all wonder, what the hell would we do if we had the whole city to ourselves? Jim comes across Serena and another man who end up saving his life. But we soon learn the details of the virus and how quickly it infects people. After the other guy dies, Jim and Serena are forced to keep moving. The two initially despise one another and don't want anything to do with each other, but as they meet Frank and Hannah, their minds change. In situations like this, it seems as though everyone has a breaking point. As strong as you think you are by yourself, you always need help, and the 4 of them learned that along the way.The joy of the shopping scene was one of the highlights of the movie for me, as it was the only scene where all of our leads were genuinely happy. It's a simple smile that you remember from scenes like this. As chaos unfolds and each character comes into their own, choices had to be made. I think Jim's character arc was great as the more he grew adapt to the situation, the more he acted like the infected. Which by the way, Danny Boyle did a great job at imagining new types of zombies. They move fast and frantically instead of the stupidity of slowly walking. His filming of them was also fascinating. There weren't many moments if at all that he surprised us with their appearance. Often, he would show them first to us, before the characters would see them. In terms of the ending, well I could tell that the directors had different intentions, and hearing about the alternate endings, I think I would have preferred one of those to the one we got. It's a different approach to the horror and jump scare moments. So in all, 28 Days Later is a refreshing take on the horror and zombie genre. It's still not my cup of tea, but I can respect it's greatness.+Cillian's arc +New types of zombies +Boyle's style +Beautiful quiet moments -Opening didn't pay off -Ending felt contrived 7.6/10",7,2,2,18 May 2015
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Redundant, and Inconsistent
","I really don't feel like Steven Spielberg wanted to make this film. And for everybody involved it was just a straight money grab. I really enjoyed the first Jurassic Park film and for a 1993 flick, its about as visually entertaining as a film can be. But this one felt too similar and so much didn't make any sense.First off, why do they not say at all in the first film that there is a second Island? And if that family in the very beginning of the movie is on vacation there, you would think people taking them there would know the Island history? I also felt as though the idea that people still want to visit this Island knowing there are deadly animals there is preposterous. There were a few times in the movie where I felt like it was going to end and didn't, particularly with the last 20 minutes of the movie. Who approved that man taking the T-Rex back to society? WHY DOES HE STILL WANT TO OPEN A JURASSIC PARK!? I think the inclusion of Vince Vaughn into the mix was a waste. I would have thought they would use him more as comic relief, but essentially he is the same character as Jeff Goldblum's. In fact I would say the chemistry is better between Vaughn and Julianne Moore than with her on screen boyfriend, Goldblum. The whole other story thread with the hunters was also a bore and really wasn't needed. Make this film 90 minutes and I would have rated it higher.With all this being said, I am really looking forward to Jurassic World. With Chris Pratt and Jake Johnson, two of the funniest young actors in the business today, I know it has the potential to be as entertaining as the first movie. I may pass on the third Jurassic Park if its too similar to the first two. There were some parts of Lost World that were great, including the T-Rex scenes. One of the things that was missing from the first movie was more screen time of the big dinosaurs. I found my heart pounding on more than one occasion in those scenes.In a film that has mostly the same scenarios as its predecessor and disappointing climax, you can still find some entertainment with the T-Rex character, which is why I'm not giving it a 2 or 3.5.6/10",5,1,5,10 April 2014
Legend," Blood is Thicker than Water
","I drove a half an hour just to see this movie. Tom Hardy is one of my favorite actors and seeing him play two gangsters in the same film? Yeah count me in. The problem is the film around Hardy isn't all that interesting. There are moments of greatness but it's lengthy runtime (or at least it felt long), unoriginal direction, and a messy script can only take Hardy's great performance so far.The movie does however deliver on what the marketing promised, two great Tom Hardy performances. Not only is he unrecognizable as Ronnie Kray, but the scenes with both brothers on screen are seamless. Those are by far the highlight of the film. The strange but real relationship between these brothers parading through London during the 1960's as gangsters should have made for a great film. Moments come and go where you can see shades of the great gangster pictures, but the film doesn't come together as well as it should have.However, a definitive highlight from the acting side besides Hardy is Emily Browning. I thought she was exceptional as Reggie's wife. Some also may have an issue with Hardy's other performance as Ronnie, which can be understood as some of his actions turn out to be more cartoon-ish than realistic, but when the two are on screen together, it's magic. Overall, the film is worth the price of admission if you're a Tom Hardy fan, but don't expect much in terms of a fluid and functionally directed picture.+Hardy+Great individual scenes+Browning-Sloppy script-The story doesn't pop6.1/10",6,1,5,13 December 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Unprecedented
","The two things that Marvel movies have always been under criticism for are their villains and lack of stakes. Not only does Infinity War put those criticisms away, it takes full advantage of the gravitas of the comic book it's based on. I can't really imagine a better way that the MCU could have closed out a 19 movie arc, while also perfectly setting up the final (for now) installment next May.In one of the gutsiest and deadliest superhero films to date, The Russo Brothers have once again delivered a meaningful and thought provoking entry into the MCU. I don't know how they did it, but they managed to give all 30 something characters time to shine while also giving several of the big Avengers or Guardian related characters an impactful arc of their own. There are very minute pacing issues that perhaps some casual fans may take issue with, but for someone who has been with this universe from the beginning, I ate it all up. I'm not sure there are any directors who could have possibly executed this story as well as The Russo brothers did.As with Age of Ultron, I worried that the tone of the trailers (dark and serious) wouldn't really translate to the movie, as the MCU is known for its humor. Ultron was a very funny movie but it still felt like a missed opportunity to not have a little more emotional weight to that story. Luckily, Infinity War brilliantly balances humor, heart, and some serious sh*t that goes down in this adventure-heist-thriller. Much like its comic-book counterpart, Infinity War follows Thanos (and it's largely his story) and his quest for the 6 Infinity stones which gives him the power to wipe out half the universe. How can you possibly give someone like that shades of humanity and an understandable motivation? Well somehow they did it, and when Thanos or someone else does things that bring the emotion out of him, it's some of the best sequences of the film.Most impressively, the Russo's and the writers figured out a way to pick up where we left each character while also making it fit into an Avengers story that needed them to more specific things related to a bigger threat. In other words, this film is driven by characters and not plot. As much as I love Age of Ultron, it feels more like a film that had their characters act based on where the filmmakers wanted the plot to go (i.e. Thor's quest in the middle of the film). Infinity War is far from that, and is clearly structured by filmmakers who still have stories left to tell in this universe.I could go on and on about specific plot elements, scene stealers, surprises, and the bold direction the film takes, but I decided to take a more vague approach to this review to not spread the spoilery thoughts that the internet has been filled with the past few days. In short, Infinity War is the most balls to the wall film Marvel has ever done, but still fills it with brilliantly quiet moments that made Civil War and Winter Soldier so groundbreaking.10/10",10,1,3,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A World I Would Live In
","One of the best compliments a director can receive is that I wish their film was longer. That's not to say that OUATIH isn't very long, as it certainly is for today's standards, but I truly could have lived in this world for another hour or two. Quentin Tarantino's brilliant sense for world building without ever having to do a sequel (aside from Kill Bill, which he still contends is one story anyway) is extremely impressive. He loves to take his sweet time with monologue after monologue and countless amounts of long shots that a normal filmmaker would cut down significantly, but I ate all of it up.Oh, and we've never had a DiCaprio/Pitt team-up before? That counts for a lot too. Their chemistry makes the movie fly by, and pulls on your heart up until the bitter end. This isn't a story about the Manson murders, rather a story about friendship and the idea of old hollywood meeting new hollywood. The 50's, 60's, and even into the 70's were considered a thriving time for filmmaking and Tarantino clearly has a huge affinity to this era, and of course, Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie). Sure, maybe she doesn't have a ton of dialogue, but her presence is felt throughout every scene with DiCaprio as the 'new age' seeps into his career and forces him to make drastic changes to his path.A slow burn for most of the film turns into a hectic and absolutely insane final act, one which is already dividing audiences, but creating conversation is exactly what Tarantino sets out to do. He better not retire after his 10th film.....Special shoutout to Margaret Qualley, this is a star making turn from her.9.4/10",9,14,22,7 August 2019
Gone Girl," I Felt Like Something to Be Jettisoned
","Once in awhile a film comes around that throws your brain into so many places that it becomes hard to come to grips if you actually like it or not. Don't get me wrong I liked Gone Girl. I think it's a brilliantly directed film. But this film also ticked me off more than one I can remember. David Fincher films tend to have that effect on you at times. And a sign of a great film is one that makes you think for hours upon hours after viewing, and Gone Girl does that. It's one of the most twisted, obscure, and disturbing films I have seen. But not because any obscene images or gross out scenes. But because it is such a cynical view on marriage and relationships in general, or even just the human brain. You leave the theater asking, do people really think like this? Is trust a big enough issue to where a sustainable relationship is completely off the table? First of all, major props to everyone involved with this film. All of the performances are marvelous. Affleck is at his best and Rosamund Pike gives what is most likely an Oscar worthy turn. But it's once again David Fincher who is the star of the film. Every scene looks and sounds beautiful (thanks to a little help from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). Fincher directs with such ease that at times you feel like you're actually observing these events happen in Missouri and not in a theater. A scene in particular near the end of the film that was so perfectly directed and looks so unbelievably real that it's hard not picture Fincher getting an Oscar nomination for directing.The screenplay was done by the author of the book of the same name by Gillian Flynn. From what I hear, she is great at writing well developed characters. And I think the characters worked really well on screen. Tyler Perry's Tanner Bolt gave both comedic flare and a relatable character for the audience in a movie that involves several off-the-wall crazy people. I'd like to think that I can trust the people closest to me to be honest and not hide secrets. It's hard to like any of the characters in this film. Fincher often gives us glimpses of good characters but with many flaws. Gone Girl very well may be his most depressing movie. It's hard to imagine this author having a family and kids and being able to write such horrific tales without thinking twice.Onto the highly publicized 'twists'. I'll say right off the bat that I didn't expect any of them coming. But I wasn't overly shocked either. It was built up to me to be something that is so unthinkable that it will be hard to wrap your mind around. Sure the film surprised me at times, but it's no Se7en. I think if I wouldn't have had both my sister and my girlfriend build this book and it's twists up so high I would have had a more fulfilling experience. But I did love watching this movie. It's also perhaps a movie I appreciate more on second viewing. Most of Fincher's work is significantly better after a few watches.Overall Gone Girl sets out to do exactly what it wants to. It's a haunting tale and the supposed 'husband kills wife' style film. It's also a funny play on the media today and how our view on the world is solely based on what the media feeds us. With this beginning the Oscar season it's hard to say how it shapes up against the field. But I will say Pike and Fincher are locks. With Affleck hopefully picking up his first acting nomination as well. As a score, it's very hard to give one. This film is truly the 'Zodiac killings' of a review. I don't know that I will ever grasp what the right score is for a film like this.+Pike +Affleck deserves his first acting nomination +Fincher's direction is PERFECT +Well written characters +Does exactly what it sets out to do +Tyler Perry was actually GREAT! +Score -Not-so-shocking twists -Ticked me off -Ending 8.4/10",10,3,12,4 October 2014
Get Out," Laughs and Scares Balanced Perfectly
","Out of all the possible genre combinations, horror and comedy are probably the most difficult to combine. I'm not sure if first time director Jordan Peele impresses more with that particular balance, or with his ability to effectively display social commentary.Blumhouse Productions is putting together quite the resume. Their films continue to make bank at the box office, but the diversity of their horror features are nothing to scoff at either. Just in the last few years alone they've made films like The Gift, The Visit, Split, and now Get Out. All original twists on the horror/thriller genre. Get Out may be the most impressive yet.I always talk about my disconnect with the horror genre and how I don't find much substance with 75% of the films. Get Out turns the genre on its head, doesn't rely on jump scares, is surrounded by tremendous performances, and has a socially relevant script. It is so rare for a film to have a socially relevant message without feeling too political or one sided. I can't tell you how many times I've appreciated what a film or a TV show is saying, but I get turned off by the way it's portrayed. Get Out manages to make an entertaining horror/thriller, while also commenting on unintentional and benevolent racism coming from a white family towards their daughter's new boyfriend, an African American.It's the racism most people don't normally think about. The people who say they aren't racist because they 'voted for Barack Obama' or maybe because 'Tiger Woods is their favorite athlete'. Films like 12 Years of Slave and the recent documentary, 13th, are important. But it's films like Get Out that are more effective because they are giving the same message in a different way. Brilliantly written and structured, Peele gets the most out of his actors and times the laughs and scares in an effective manner. Please go out and support an original film like Get Out. You won't be disappointed.+Original+Laughs and scares+Really well acted+Pacing9.1/10",9,12,33,25 February 2017
Aladdin," Not the Train Wreck Everyone Thought it Would Be
","I was beyond skeptical when they announced Guy Ritchie to be the director to helm the live-action version of the beloved 'Aladdin', and I became even more worried after seeing King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Not that that movie is a trainwreck, but I failed to see how Ritchie could inject his style into a kids movie. The answer being that he doesn't, he stays true to what made the original Aladdin a phenomena and adjusts certain plot elements that needed to be adjusted. For instance, Jafar doesn't need to be old man pining over a young Princess Jasmine. And you can't really copy what Robin Williams did as Genie, so you take Will Smith and breathe his charisma and charm into a new Genie, which feels even more modern than what Williams did. Not better, but still very good. The movie had an uphill climb to make from the moment it was announced, but I think it did about as well as it could have. Mena Massoud and Naomi Scott are stars in the making (while admittedly it took me a few scenes to warm up to these characters), who did wonders with the roles of Aladdin & Jasmine respectively. It's worth it for 'A Whole New World' alone.7.5/10",7,1,4,2 June 2019
The Theory of Everything," Time
","Another film dealing with black holes and the many theories on time. To start, I can appreciate the simplicity involved with the writing of the film. I'm glad they didn't try and complicate things too much. Instead these theories are presented to us at a high school level so basically everyone can understand. But that's not the bulk of the story or why we went to the theaters. We went to see the beautiful and difficult relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife Jane.Now it is based off of Jane's book about her life with Stephen before and after he was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. Sure the way they meet in the film is a bit clichéd but it didn't matter because of how great their chemistry was on screen. Felicity Jones was wonderful. I had only seen her in Spiderman before this so I had my doubts but her and Eddie Redmayne are close to locks for Oscars, even in this packed acting year. My favorite moments from the film involved them and just how effortlessly their chemistry seemed. It reminded me a lot of one of my all-time favorite films A Beautiful Mind in that sense. Living with someone with this disease and knowing the expected life span is not long had to be extremely difficult and Jones portrayed that perfectly. Redmayne gave us so many sides to his character without being able to do much was very impressive. He also had several emotional scenes with his family and friends that were just heartbreaking. They were beautifully mixed with Johann Johannsson score which will probably also get nominated come February.As much as I loved the relationship aspects of the film I wish we got a little more insight into just how much of a genius he was. We see him fight through this terrible disease but we don't see him fight previous theories or challenge the grain as much as I thought. We hear him talk about it briefly here and there but I cant say I remember each thing he accomplished. It did make me interested to read up on some of that going forward. It also made me appreciate Interstellar even more with some of his theories being implicated into the making of that film. So if you're a sucker for romance films you will love this story. In particular just how great the performances were. I'm sure you will hear about them come awards season.+Edmayne & Jones Oscar worthy +Johannsson's score +Chemistry among everyone -Not as much focus on his work 7.8/10",7,0,1,19 December 2014
X-Men: The Last Stand," Nearly Killed the Franchise
","Every franchise has a low point. For some it's a scene or maybe a full act of a film. For the X-Men series, it's The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine. After two acclaimed outings to kick off the new age of the superhero genre, The Last Stand is just about as goofy and messy as you can get. It nearly killed the franchise.The reason comic fans are still yearning for a Dark Phoenix adaptation is because this film did a poor job of giving fans anything that closely resembles the classic storyline. In fact, what makes it even worse is it's hardly an adaptation at all. The first chunk of the movie certainly seems to indicate a Dark Phoenix direction, but once she has a big showdown with Charles Xavier in her childhood home, it becomes a movie way more about the cure than Jean Grey. It also doesn't help that Jean Grey's phoenix alter ego resembles another absolutely insane Famke Janssen villain, Xenia Onatopp. Yes, she also turns to an intimate make out position in an attempt to kill a few of her victims. Really, Brett Ratner?Ratner gets a bad rap for The Last Stand, and most of it is warranted. But there are some redeemable qualities to this film. Plus, he did inherit the directing duties pretty late in the game (after Bryan Singer left a few weeks before production began because of Superman Returns). Although it still doesn't feel necessary at all, I definitely felt an emotional impact when Charles died and Wolverine killed Jean. The way those particular scenes were directed and shot made for an emotionally resonant few scenes. The action is also amped up a bit. Rightfully so, the first two films keep the action to a minimum and instead focus on story as the backbone. The Last Stand tends to do the opposite, hence another reason for the film's failure.As with pretty much every other X-Men related film, there's no sense of continuity whatsoever. Whether it's the appearance of Moira MacTaggart or Bolivar Trask, the bad CGI used for young Charles and Erik, or the horrendous attempt at Angel as a character, The Last Stand gets a lot wrong. The grounded tone from the first two films is gone entirely. Why the heck is Juggernaut running around acting like he's from the 60's Batman TV series? Why does Pyro act like he's a worthy right hand man to Magneto? I think the questions raised here still frustrate me to this day. This could have been one of the best superhero trilogies but instead The Last Stand tries its hardest to tarnish any reputation the first few built. There are a few moments of classic X-Men joy, but it's really a bunch of nonsense for the most part.+Some emotional moments hit-Tone is all over the place-Continuity issues galore-Was this an attempt at a Dark Phoenix saga?-Everything feels rushed4.4/10",4,1,2,23 February 2017
Room," Small World
","This is a perfect example of a film that sold me just by its premise: A boy who has been kept in one room his entire life by his mother, begins to wonder what the limits of the world beyond the walls of the enclosed area are. It's also a film that if you're planning on going to see, you shouldn't watch any of the trailers or even read the IMDb synopsis. Just go out and see one of the best films of the year. Brie Larson, who impresses more and more each film she appears in, plays Joy, mother of Jack. Larson hides the depths of her character for a good portion of the film, which makes the emotional moments all the more powerful later on. The story of a mother and son trying to escape this 'room' and their whole emotional journey is what drives Room to greatness. The film itself has a unique structure in that it seems the film could have ended about 45 minutes before it did, but yet it keeps going. It's not that that time is wasted, but I think the flow and rhythm of the movie isn't always there. Which is why the emotional moments midway through are what stick out to me most.Jacob Tremblay absolutely kills it as Jack. At 5 years old and an extremely demanding role, it's hard not to think he deserves some awards attention as well. He pulls off every emotion that is called of him and his chemistry with Brie Larson couldn't be better. The supporting cast is really good as well, but that can get into spoiler territory so I'll stick with the two leads. I also should mention Lenny Abrahamson's directing. I loved the way he chose to unveil why exactly Jack and his mother are stuck in this room and the revelations that follow. Room as a whole isn't always as smooth as it wants to be, but the performances are among the years best, and I think the story will take you on an unexpected emotional roller coaster.+Larson+Tremblay's performance is an anomaly+Emotional journey+Meticulous directing-Second half doesn't live up to the first8.7/10",8,2,11,28 November 2015
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Enjoyable but no Big Fish
","When I think of those great adventure films, I think of Life Of Pi and Big Fish. In those films I was not only blown away by the visuals but was emotionally moved to the core in each. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty has a good message but never takes me out of just a normal movie going experience and into something special. The trailers were mesmerizing and I thought it may be a movie to compete with Gravity and 12 Years a Slave for best picture. It results in a fun and adventurous ride, but doesn't do much else.Ben Stiller is perfect as the day dreamer who has never done anything that important in life but gets stuck in this case of Sean Oconnel and what he wants the last cover of Life Magazine to be. I have to say the movie takes just a bit too long to actually reach the adventure parts. But I did really like Kristen Wiig, and I can understand why Walter Mitty cant get his mind off of her. But on the other hand, Adam Scott's character is unrealistic. He comes off as a grade school bully, rather than some sort of business world jerk.Even though the point of the movie was to get Walter out in the real world by himself and realize his worth to others, there was a part of me that wished Cheryl would have gone with him. I feel if they would have made this movie more of a complete romance to go along with an adventure, it may have helped hit those emotional highs and lows I was looking for. For Ben Stiller its a good directorial effort and its something to be proud of because the movie looks fantastic. Like I said the visuals are top notch but thats the only aspect of the movie that was an A+.I would recommend waiting until this one is on cable, but make sure your watching the HD version, because it is a true spectacle. +tremendous visuals+Kristen Wiig-not what the trailers promised-would have liked more romance/emotional appeal7.0/10",7,0,0,19 May 2014
The Lion King," Life's Not Fair
","The one thing I keep saying to people about this reimagining of the 1994 classic is that it's essentially a shot for shot remake and if you're argument is 'what's the point of it then?', I won't necessarily argue with you. But I will tell you that this film is meant to be seen on the big screen, and is a visual masterpiece. With that said, they added about 30 minutes worth of footage but the story is almost exactly the same. In other words, it's still Hamlet with Lions, and if you're okay with that, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy the remake. Coming off The Jungle Book, I don't think anyone will deny the appeal of Jon Favreau attempting to put a CGI/live action spin on the classic tale. 95% of the cast is picture perfect, even if they don't necessarily compare to the original (i.e. Jeremy Irons), and I can get behind most of the new takes on the songs as well. Maybe the Beyonce song is out of place and perhaps you can't fully feel the emotion behind the animals eyes, when you don't have animators manipulating the characters' faces in the 1994 version, but I was still able to feel the 'Disney Magic' in what may be the most real looking 'animated' film I have ever seen. Aside from a few frustrating minor changes (that only a die-heard Lion King fan who has seen the original over 100 times would care about), I enjoyed the live action film more than I probably should have. It hit me right in the feels.8.8/10",8,2,5,1 August 2019
Stardust," Films Aren't Made Like This Anymore
","Is it weird that the one thing that really sticks out about Stardust is that one of the small subplots involves Daredevil and Superman getting into an argument? Well, I guess that's not entirely the case, but a young Charlie Cox and Henry Cavill essentially fighting each other probably would have been more than enough to please me. Stardust is far more than a simple love story or fairy tale, it's irreverent and oozing with genre fun. Oh and you also have an extraordinarily gifted cast across the board.Films aren't really made like this anymore. It's so hard to come by a big budgeted/genre film with a lighthearted tone and with this type of humor. You could see it on TV, or perhaps in the 1980's, but good fantasy films are so disappointingly rare these days. The closest could perhaps be something like the Kingsman movies (which Matthew Vaughn also directed), but even those could just be labeled as success due to comic-book background.But the pure fantasy adventure is surely something cinema's could use a little bit more of these days. If movies can get actors like Robert De Niro to do some of the ridiculous things he does in this movie, then I think we have a winning formula. But in all seriousness, Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michele Pfeiffer, Henry Cavill, De Niro, and Sienna Miller make for a fantastic ensemble cast of witches, Kings, a star (?), and one special prince to make for a thrilling adventure.7.6/10",7,2,3,11 March 2018
The Elephant Man," 'I am a human being!'
","In what may be the ultimate Hollywood film about dignity and triumph over all evil, David Lynch directs the story of a disfigured man who gets brutally tortured and sold for laughs. It is truly hard to believe this is partially based on a true story. But even in a story that seems to be far from a human tale, it's the closest thing to showing all of us how good people do exist.I hadn't seen any of Lynch's previously work so I had only heard of his greatness. But I wasn't overly impressed with his style. I found too many scenes to be cut away far too soon. This story has several moments of great emotional impact, but when the scenes are cut to a different area it loses the gravitas. But Lynch did bring the most out of the actors involved and the devastating script. Some of the villains I found to be a bit too one note though, which wasn't a deal breaker, just more or less annoying.Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt worked well together and overall will be what I remember this movie for. Well and of course the famous scene under the train station when John yells the line 'I am not an animal, I AM A HUMAN BEING!'. There aren't many movies that made me think more than The Elephant Man, even if I didn't feel the emotional weight that I had wanted to.+Legendary performances +Stunning makeup work +More relatable than you may think +Good always triumphs -Wanted more emotional gravitas -Too many scenes cut away too soon 8.3/10",8,0,1,28 July 2014
A Quiet Place," A Thrilling Piece of Art
","Doesn't it kind of seem like a trend now that I sit here and write about how great the latest horror film was? A Quiet Place is the next GREAT entry into the genre, and it's entirely original idea. Wow, well I guess that should put some people to rest who say Hollywood doesn't make original films anymore, which by the way, I also said after watching Unsane a few weeks back.I will watch anything Emily Blunt does, and she's certainly great in A Quiet Place. But I think her husband, John Krasinski, should be the one commended for his work here. Both in front and behind the camera John brings a great amount of intensity and charisma respectively. I've liked him other things like 13 Hours and the little amount of The Office I've seen, but I don't think he's been as good in front of the camera as he is in A Quiet Place. However, he's even better building tension all the way into an absolute thrilling final 30 minutes, behind the camera.It's equally terrifying as it is expertly crafted in pacing. A Quiet Place may be the most surprising film of 2018 thus far, and it will certainly open the door for Krasinski directing wise, as well as hopefully the studios to make more originally based horror/thriller films. It seems to work more often than it doesn't these days, right?9.4/10",9,6,11,13 April 2018
The Bourne Legacy," As a Bourne Film, It's No Good. But as an Action Film? Solid.
","As the 4th Bourne film in the series, 'Legacy' isn't all that inventive or revealing. But as a spy-action-thriller, it's pretty solid. And Aaron Cross is hardly as interesting as Bourne, but Renner's charismatic presence is more than enough to get by.In the age of shared universes, Universal decided it was a good idea to make another Bourne film in 2012, after years of trying to get a 4th Damon film off the ground. While the script and direction from Tony Gilroy relies heavily on the same tropes of the series, I can't say it's a film that shouldn't have been made. It should have just deviated from the source material even more than it did.With that said, I like the fact that the film takes place at and around the same time that 'Ultimatum' did. The approach to have Jason Bourne's actions impact Cross' and the rest of the Black Ops agents was a smart one. It's a far better decision than having Renner be the re-casted Bourne. But as Cross, Renner is quite good. I'm not sure he got cast in all of these franchises, but he doesn't seem to disappoint.Renner is complemented by a powerful performance from Rachel Weisz, who plays Cross' former doctor. Much like Bourne and Marie in 'Identity', they have great chemistry together and Weisz thankfully more with her character than what's written on the page. Edward Norton plays the new suspicious C.I.A figure, which has become a classic Bourne trope at this point. Although I think Norton is a good actor, he didn't do anything as Eric Byer that impressed me all that much. With minimal screen time together, it was tough to grapple onto Byer's perusal of Bourne.The action and cinematography are much easier to watch without Greengrass' infamous shaky cam. With that said, there is far less action mixed with a slower pace. The film doesn't really become interesting until 30 or 40 minutes in.In all, The Bourne Legacy largely handcuffs itself and falls into the series tropes too often to be considered on the level that the previous 3 films are. But good performances from its leads and some interesting action makes it a nice cable watch.+Renner & Weisz+Solid action-Handcuffs itself-Falls into the same tropes7.4/10",7,1,1,29 July 2016
22 Jump Street," A Comedy That Knows It's Crazy
","I think movies are at their best when they don't try to be anything but what their suppose to be. The Fast and Furious franchise do this by realizing how incredibly crazy the plot is, and embracing it. I think so far the Jump Street franchise has done the same. Because of how much of a surprise 21 Jump Street was, I went into this movie hoping it would at least be entertaining. Comedies always have a tough time with sequels. Usually because of using the same plot over and over again, hence The Hangover franchise. But 22 Jump Street tells us out of the gate that it's the same mission, with the same guys, and likely with the same outcome. I think 22 is superior to the original and in many ways opens the door for future sequels to come.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum not only have tremendous chemistry but the comedic timing for both is unbelievable. Especially for Tatum, who's roots had nothing to do with comedy. They are the perfect buddy cop duo. Ice Cube is also back and this time it's more than just a heightened cameo. He plays a crucial role especially near the end. I have to say the scene at the restaurant and back at 22 Jump Street about mid way through the movie, are two of the funnies scenes in cinema history. I laughed so hard I didn't even hear Tatum when he was running around the building high fiving everybody. Because the movie is basically the same, I think it does run into a few problems.First off it's very predictable, and the character development is taken directly from the first Jump Street. As much as I thought I knew what was coming, most of the funny scenes were not spoiled by trailers. Which is definitely refreshing to hear about a comedy, especially in this day n age.I thought Amber Stevens and Jillian Bell were two great additions to the cast, as they were both funny and in Stevens case, brought the few scenes with real charm to the screen. Overall I think it's better than the first and it's a good example of a sequel that is the same plot as the first, but is able to actually execute. It also has a high re-watch-ability factor much thanks to the duo of Tatum and Hill.+The movie knows it's crazy +Tatum and Hill are a perfect comedic duo+Two Ice Cube scenes +Comedy sequel that's better than the first-Predictable -Not much character development 8.5/10",8,3,10,13 June 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Hard to Believe It's a True Story
","Obviously for movies based on true stories, certain liberties are taken to make the experience that much more thrilling. But for Dog Day Afternoon it didn't seem like many truths were twisted at all. In fact, for the most part it stayed true to the source material. But to me it's still hard to believe all of this happened. Pacino and Lumet make a great actor director combination in this dark comedy about a bank robbery gone bad.To me, crime dramas are often better when it's all taken seriously as most of the time lives are in danger. It just bothers me a bit when the crowd is chanting and cheering for Sonny when he is holding a handful of people at gunpoint. I wonder if that's exactly how it happened back in 1972. I tend to like crime films like The Town and Gone Baby Gone much more because kidnapping and murder are things that people should take seriously.Besides that, Dog Day Afternoon is a good film. The supporting cast is flawless. It was also interesting seeing Fredo and Michael Corleone in the same movie again. It's truly unfortunate that Cazale didn't live longer. Each of the five films he completed were masterpieces. So with a few minor complaints here and there it comes out to be a pretty solid movie, although I don't think it needed to be a full two hours.+Pacino & Lumet +Cazale is dynamite in one of his few roles +Script-Can we take this situation a bit more seriously? -Length 7.4/10",7,0,1,7 August 2014
Amadeus," Mediocrity Is Everything
","With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages. But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.Winning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.Of course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his 'rivalry' with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.What didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.Another thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film. Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant. Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.I may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another. The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while. As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce. Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.+Abraham+Music-Hulce-Characters lack humanity-A tad long5.8/10",5,9,17,12 September 2016
The Game," ENJOY Life People
","With David Fincher, you are always guaranteed to have many thrills, a few twists, and a well put together film. Fincher is one of the best directors of this generation and probably the best Mystery-Thriller director working today. The Game has a similar feel to most of his other films but is unique enough to be memorable. Unfortunately I was looking for an ending that stunned me to pieces just as Fight Club and Se7en did. It didn't leave me wanting more answers and wanting to put the film right back into the Blu-ray player like most other Fincher films had. But it was a good film, and one of the more interesting stories put together on screen.Michael Douglas is one of those actors that I'm never jumping out of my seat to see because of various reasons. But he is terrific in The Game. Watching him discover secrets and clues was all the more thrilling with his top notch acting. The supporting cast is fine, but I thought Sean Penn may have a bigger role. It's also a movie that I hoped the solution and the final answer to 'the game' wouldn't be so simple. But in fact in the end it was. It really was all just a game which seemed like too easy of a solution. Especially because of the amount of times Michael Douglas' life was in serious danger. It was all to just get Michael Douglas to enjoy life a little more and not end up like the father, which I understand but I would have liked something a bit more thought out. I realize you have to suspend your disbelief while watching these types of movies but it just took me out of it. For a movie that I couldn't keep my eyes and ears from it the whole film, it just disappointed me in the end. A great ending can save a movie for me but a bad one doesn't kill it.I think The Game is a movie that doesn't require multiple viewings because of the simple solution but it may be worth it because of the incredible writing and directing from Fincher. It's not one of his best, but every director has a slight misstep. I look forward to seeing what Fincher does with the best selling book 'Gone Girl' this fall. It's about time this man gets an Oscar.+Douglas +Gripping story, eye popping +Fincher tone and writing -Ending is a big disappointment -Douglas was put into too many dangerous situations for my liking 7.1/10",7,0,1,2 September 2014
Call Me by Your Name," Powerfully Poignant Romance
","Have you ever seen a movie that you liked but then once you see the ending you really really liked the movie? Well, that was Call Me By Your Name for me. What is undoubtedly a good movie for 115 minutes, becomes a great one after the full 132 minutes. Luca Guadagnino directs this film in such a calming but yet provocative manner. When the film needs to heat up, it does, and when it needs to slow down and provide a more methodical and thoughtful approach to romance, it most certainly does that as well.I guess with every big film there's always a section of the audience that comes out with serious backlash to some sort of aspect to the story. With Call Me By Your Name, it was that the romance between a 24-year old male (Oliver, played by Armie Hammer) and a 17-year old male (Ellio, played by Timothee Chalamet) is unethical and highly controversial. While I can't speak for how that particular group of people felt watching the film, I can tell you that I never once felt like this was a relationship that wasn't consensual. In fact, it's not even so much that it was definitely portrayed as consensual by the two males (and the parents of the younger male for that matter), but it's that the film never makes an outright statement saying that a relationship with this age gap is 'right'. It's a fictional story with fictional people. No one is telling you this relationship is right or glorifying what is considered to be a forbidden relationship.Personally, I took it more as a young male figuring out love for the first time and the person who helps him discover that love is an older (albeit only 7 years) male with more experience. I won't tell anyone who feels differently that they are wrong, that's simply the way I saw the story play out. And if I'm being honest, I thought the relationship between Ellio and Oliver was beautifully told and portrayed. Chalamet is magnetic and relatable (no matter what your sexual preference is) and Hammer nicely balanced the 'hard to get' and effortlessly desirable part of the romance. I'm a straight man in my mid-20's but I found there to be things very relatable in both of their characters.The film also does a good job of presenting a world that feels foreign but also approachable. Taking place in Italy and in 1983, Call Me By Your Name is great escapist cinema, while also being something timeless in storytelling. Something only few films can capture, a few being Richard Linklater's Before Trilogy, which was clearly an inspiration. My only gripe would probably be the pacing, which is purposefully slower in nature. For me, I just would have liked something that gets to the punch a little quicker. Speaking of 'the punch', the clear winner of this picture is Michael Stuhlbarg's ending speech about love to Ellio. I never thought a short monologue from one man to another could be so powerfully poignant, but that was this speech.8.6/10",8,2,6,3 January 2018
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales," A Return to Form
","In a similar way that Mad Max Fury Road, Jason Bourne, The Force Awakens, Creed, and Jurassic World, Dead Men Tell No Tales attempts to make both a sequel and a reboot, which some people refer to as a remake-quel. Remarkably, it succeeds in doing just that. Honoring the lore that came before and establishing fun new characters to follow as well, Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Pirates film since the original. That's a surprisingly impressive feat.Picking up a good time after At World's End (I think 19 years to be exact), Henry Turner, searches for a potential item that would reverse all of the curses in the Caribbean, including his father's lifetime duty as captain of the Flying Dutchman. Part of what makes this film so great is that it revitalizes the series in an unexpected way. I never knew how much I would have enjoyed following new characters (albeit similar in spirit to those of Elizabeth and William). Much like the last few entries, there are a few very unfunny and cringe worthy Jack Sparrow moments, but that's to be expected at this point.Tonally and aesthetically, Dead Men Tell No Tales is a return to what made The Curse of the Black Pearl so special. Colorful, grandiose, ambitious, and even at times frightening is exactly what this film needed to recapture. Of course, there are plenty of fantastic action sequences, visually stunning special effects, and the inevitably charmingly convoluted plot. Speaking of charming, Henry and his love interest, Carina, are very good together in playing off of Sparrow. They're far from throw away characters like Philip and Syrena were last time around. I actually found myself getting invested in Henry's mission to save his father, and Carina's astronomical goals. Most pleasing of all is seeing the return of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly in minor but significant roles. The film doesn't rely on the presence of them, instead using their legacy as a bolster for the development of a new story with fresh faces. Combining those characters with Sparrow, Barbossa, and a typically solid turn from Javier Bardem made this film a joy to watch. One that has enough humor, and a surprising amount of heart and emotional payoff for a Pirates film. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I would love another sequel, heck maybe even another few films.+Surprises & returns+Brings the fun & mystique back to the series+Henry & Carina-Some humor falls flat..big time8.0/10",8,4,12,27 May 2017
X-Men: Apocalypse," False Gods
","With it being the 9th film to date in the series, and the fourth superhero film to come out in 2016, X-Men: Apocalypse had a difficult task in keeping the genre and franchise fresh. While it struggles with some of the same problems as most of these superhero ensemble pieces do, Apocalypse serves as both a satisfying conclusion to the second X- Men trilogy and an exciting beginning to the next chapter.Bryan Singer returns to the franchise once again to direct, as do James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Nicholas Hoult, Evan Peters, and Rose Byrne. Newcomers include Sophie Turner as Jean Grey, Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers, Kodi Smit-McPhee as Nightcrawler, and Alexandra Shipp as Storm. A strong point in all of the X-Men entries has been the acting, and Apocalypse is no different. McAvoy and Fassbender perfectly portray Professor X and Magneto as the two opposing viewpoints to the mutant situation. Unfortunately, they don't get as much screen time together as the two previous entries, but that makes their scenes together that much more special.As far as the newbies go, while they weren't the central focus of the films, I really connected to Jean Grey and Scott Summers. Nightcrawler provides some comedic relief and Angel doesn't really serve any purpose in the film, but Scott and Jean were handled well, especially the ladder. Being that Sophie Turner didn't completely prove herself till the last few seasons of Game of Thrones, I was skeptical of her going in. But Turner did a nice job at balancing the immense power of her character while giving her a relatable appeal that made Famke Janssen's performance so great.The introduction of Apocalypse was also a tough sell. Adapting the character from his comic-book counterpart is one thing, but I was pleased with how smoothly his origin fit into the film. It's hard finding a villain that can one up Magneto on a scene to scene basis, but Oscar Isaac's titular villain does just that. Perhaps seeing a bit more of him would have served the story more, but his short and significant scenes with each of his four horseman were enough to sell me on his ominous presence.I think some of the faults of the film involve the overabundance of characters the film decides to focus on. Every X-Men film is an ensemble piece, but 'Apocalypse' tries its hardest to do service to so many characters, and sometimes it can be a little messy. I don't think there are even scenes I really disliked, but there are some that feel unnecessary. Overall, the film succeeds at so many levels it's hard to be disappointed in the outcome. The X-Men films have always been one to pull and tug on emotions that other superhero films and blockbusters fail to do, and 'Apocalypse' definitely does that. For all of the explosions and disaster that Apocalypse causes, it still feels very personal to the X-Men, and I can certainly appreciate that type of storytelling. A little bit of extra care to the script and direction will lead to a much tighter film next time around.+Sophie Turner's Jean Grey+The newbies are handled well+Introduction of Apocalypse+Fassbender and McAvoy are once again powerhouses-Overabundance of focus on too many characters8.7/10",7,6,13,28 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Even with it's flaws, its still a Spidey movie
","Yes this movie has some pretty big flaws, and yes I was somewhat let down because of my sky high expectations. But it's still highly entertaining and pretty fun. I really like this movie but I wanted to love it. Andrew Garfield is the definitive Spider-Man and is way more entertaining than Tobey Maguire ever was. And the love story between Peter and Gwen is twice as good as the Mary Jane and Peter story. This movie has some of the best scenes of any of the Spider-Man movies, and by far some of the most emotional. But I do feel like director Marc Webb threw almost everything into this film which became packed with far too many story threads. The story about who Peter's parents really were should have been resolved in the first movie, and this movie would have benefited without the opening deaths of them. But also the chemistry between Gwen and Peter is the best on screen duo in all of the franchise, so really I shouldn't be complaining.The narrative itself is packed. I liked the multiple villain approach because at the least it kept us guessing what was next. But I also think the death of Electro was anti-climactic and should have been handled differently. Speaking of deaths, I don't believe for one second that Norman Osborn is dead. If you get Chris Cooper to play a villain you don't kill him off after 5 minutes of screen time. The death of Gwen Stacy hurt though. I knew it was coming but even then it was heartbreaking because of how much Peter is really at fault for all this. Garfield nailed that scene, and actually so did Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborn. For the limited time he got, he showed the true menacing (and actual Goblin) side we didn't get to see with the original Spider-Man film. Electro was cool but underused and somewhat wasted.I liked the little hints to the future of the franchise, and especially the hints toward J.Jonah Jameson. The Sinister Six hints were also cool but question, are they going to be in Amazing Spider-Man 3? If not who will the villain be? Which by the way if the credits were really suppose to tease the Sinister Six it was too tough to tell, and didn't think the X-Men credit scene was needed, why not just give us an actual Spider-Man teaser.Also it's worth noting how cool the scenes are when Spider-Man is just swinging around, it's definitely the best effects the franchise has had. Not to mention how cute that scene was with the kid dressing up like Spider-Man. I mean come on that's everybody's dream right? So my overall feelings are mostly positive. Anyone can enjoy this film, and I will see it a few more times so that should tell you something about it considering how expensive movies can be these days. Here's hoping the future of the franchise can make that GIANT step like The Dark Knight and Cap 2 did.8.0/10",8,3,10,1 May 2014
Ex Machina," Gods Amongst Humans
","Much like 'Her' from a few years back, Ex Machina deals with the sexual relationship that someone can have with an A.I. or just the possibilities of what may happen when that inevitably comes to fruition. I really like how we are advancing as a nation that filmmakers are given the freedom and (some) money to develop a project like this that probably wouldn't have been made 20-30 years ago. It's also the first film I can remember that really dove into the sexuality of an A.I. Because think about it, if you are aware of who you are, you're bound to develop some kind of feelings towards something at some point. So I appreciated that.Unfortunately besides some creative ideas and a solid script, I never felt that the film became something special or unique. All of the performances, including the spectacular newcomer Alicia Viklander, are great. Both of the Star Wars actors, Isaac and Gleeson share an interesting dynamic, though pretty predictable. But other than a few expositional lines throughout, we don't get a sense of who these characters were before they got here. There's pretty much no set up at all. Gleeson's character just wins a contest to go see Isaac in this far off area of the world to test his A.I. It's also worth noting that the film has some clear similarities to another Artificial Intelligence film called The Machine. In fact, the lead female A.I is named AVA in both. There are a few conveniences along the way that also hindered the powerful story that lay underneath. That which include the random power failures. It was simply just a plot device to further the dynamic of Isaac and Gleeson in a convenient way.But like I said, there is a lot to like about the film. For a relatively small budget, the visual effects were fantastic. It was a genuine surprise and an improvement over The Machine's sometimes noticeable CG. I loved each and every one of the performances, although the cast is pretty small. Each of them have a bright future in the business and perhaps we will look back at Ex Machina as one of the main starting points.+Star-making performances +Visual Effects +Addresses the sexuality of an A.I.-Didn't feel all that unique to me 7.5/10",7,0,2,21 July 2015
Patton," Larger Than Life
","Films are not made like this anymore. You don't have a near 3 hour biopic of a famous person hit the theaters. In fact, something like this would almost certainly be a Netflix/HBO/Hulu miniseries. That's just the world we live in, which is why I love going back and seeing a film like Patton or Lawrence of Arabia just to appreciate the different storytelling and direction of an epic like these. A fascinating human being, George S. Patton believed in strict discipline, not necessarily following orders, and reincarnation amongst other things. But he was a proven great leader who won more than he lost, but was likely ultimately beaten by his own ego. He was a larger than life figure and this film certainly showcases that.7.7/10",7,2,2,3 October 2018
Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind," Long Winded, Pun Intended
","Over the years I've grown a bigger appreciation for anime, especially films like Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, and recently Your Name. So when I heard of the acclaim that Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind was receiving across the internet, I had to give it a shot. Unfortunately I think this film is dated in tone, direction, and style. The animation isn't overly impressive, the music feels very of its time (80's) and I think more recent films have done this type of journey better. Unfair or not, that's just the reality. Even with that said, the pacifist angle to the story is pretty fascinating and Miyazaki's world building is impressive for being that many years old. It's a little long winded and could have used a bigger emotional punch, but I was never bored, for what that's worth.6.2/10",6,1,1,15 August 2019
Pawn Sacrifice," All the Wrong Moves
","To make a great sports film, or any film rather, you have to make the audience care about the characters. Sadly, not only did I not particularly care about Pawn Sacrifice's characters, but the lead, is enormously unlikable. With that said, I acknowledge that it may have been Edward Zwick's intentions (who I am a fan of by the way). He gets great performances from his leads, the film just doesn't really mesh though.Tobey Maguire gives one of his better efforts in recent memory, playing Bobby Fischer, a beloved chess player from the 1960's. Much like the film Miracle, this sports film deals with the political issues going on with the Soviets and Americans and integrates it into the films story organically. But Pawn Sacrifice does it to a much lesser extent especially considering most of the Soviet references are through Fischer's subconscious. Fischer is similar to Gene Hackman in The Conversation where he is constantly paranoid that people are watching and listening to everything he does. This revelation is the source of Maguire's performance and the depth that his character has. But once again, there was nothing that got me to care about what Fischer was going through, in fact, I was almost pulling for the Russians, and I don't think that was Zwick's intent.Liev Schreiber plays Fischer's main competitor, Boris Spassky. Unfortunately he becomes underutilized as we only see glimpses of him before the final 35 minutes or so. That was another issue I had, is that the film takes a long time to really get going. For the first half, it seemed like most of the intriguing scenes were cut and then just explained right after. I'm not a chess guy, but we don't see him play chess for more than a few minutes until late in the film. It also didn't make much sense to me what his friends' use for coming along were other than keep him sane. We don't get a sense of their back- story or what traveling with a crazy man like Fischer gives them. So Pawn Sacrifice is really nothing special. It has a few wasted performances from Maguire and Schreiber and gives just a very average look at Bobby Fischer's life.+Performances+Last act-Slow-Unlikable lead-Should I be rooting for the Russians?5.7/10",5,7,18,30 September 2015
Hidden Figures," A Hidden Gem
","While Hidden Figures suffers a bit from a run-of-the-mill biopic structure, the astounding acting across the board is enough to keep the casual movie fan pleased.I always love checking out stories that I have never heard of. I've seen The Right Stuff, Apollo 13, and I know a little bit about the background of NASA. But I knew nothing of Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. Going into a film with little previous knowledge can be immensely rewarding experience. And although Hidden Figures isn't the best movie, it's most certainly a film worth seeing.Playing the three 'hidden figures' are Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monae respectively. Aside from quite a few supporting performances from Spencer, I'm not overly familiar with these actresses' work. And perhaps unexpectedly, all three of them are terrific. Spencer gets the least to do out of the three, and still has a memorable banter with Kirsten Dunst, a racist co-worker. Monae brings a fresh and lighthearted character into the fold and complements the two of them well. Taraji P. Henson on the other-hand, is on a completely different level. If it wasn't for Portman, Adams, and Stone giving such acclaimed turns this year, Henson would have likely been a front-runner. Considering she's playing someone without much wiggle room to show emotion, it's impressive that I felt as though I could understand exactly what she was feeling in every scene. She only gets a few scenes to express herself in a grand way emotionally, and she makes the best out of them. It was easily one of the best performances of the year.Even though this story is very interesting on paper (three African American females working for NASA significantly helping America's chances of winning the Space Race), I feel like the film could have taken advantage of the story even more. I love the relationships these women have together and I instantly bought into their chemistry, as I did the material with each of the women's personal lives and families. But I don't think it came all together as neatly as I would have hoped. I wish we would have gotten a little more time with the three women together, instead of hammering home the underlying message involving racism. There's no question this story needed to be told, but at times the execution felt more formulaic than natural.+Henson is extraordinary+Incredible story+Emotion hits a few times-Directing and editing felt a little choppy-Needed more time spent with just the three of them7.0/10",7,12,42,6 January 2017
Coco," Wonderful Heartfelt Adventure
","It's no surprise Pixar has another big hit on their hands with Coco, but I'm just happy it's with a subject matter and setting that they have yet to tackle yet. Dozens of films in, and they are beginning to expand their geographical reach with storytelling. That's a long time sure, but it's most certainly better late than never. Luckily, Coco isn't just an exploration into a new territory for Pixar, it's also a brilliantly charming and original film that delves into deep themes without forgetting what makes kids films entertaining and special in their own right.It's not that Pixar or Disney Animation hasn't given us several movies that encourage children to reach for their goals (but to also remember family), but I love the way Coco uses the power of music into those genre clichés. One of my favorite films of all time is Almost Famous, and that's also a film that nails the power of music in an endearing way. Coco does this while also telling a beautiful story of family (a big one that is) in a visually stunning way. Just as Moana, Inside Out, and Finding Dory did for Disney Animation and Pixar in the last few years, Coco once again progresses the world of animation to an entirely new level. There's one particular shot in Coco, as Miguel first enters and gazes upon the world of the dead, that is among the most impresses shots visually that I have seen in quite some time.Of course, Coco isn't just a technical darling, it's also a heartfelt story of a family with tradition, and sometimes there's nothing more likable than that. It isn't easy to truly care about a group of dead family members to the lead character, Miguel, but somehow this film manages to do just that. Probably due to the charisma of young Miguel, the witty dialogue, and poignant direction from Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina. With a few twists and turns, well-developed characters, dazzling visuals, and one epic journey, Coco is yet another solid entry into Disney/Pixar's long list of animated adventures. It was a little long in the tooth (as was the excruciating Olaf 'short' in front of it) but it didn't take away from the importance and impact that Coco will have an audience's of all shapes and sizes.8.6/10",8,1,9,26 November 2017
1917," An Achievement Unlike Anything You've Seen in a Theater in Quite Some Time
","1917, if released before Jan 1, would have easily cracked my top 5 films of the year, and more than likely made it into my top films of the decade list as well. A brilliant display of filmmaking from top to bottom, an emotional ride in a war film that I haven't felt since probably Saving Private Ryan (but Dunkirk may have something to say about that), and simply one of the most visceral movie-going experiences I can ever remember having. The movie barely takes a second to breathe, and its during those few minutes that I often realized how sore my a** was from being stuck in the same viewing position for a good 45 minute stretch. Roger Deakins and Sam Mendes deserve a ton of credit for their insistence that the film be presented as if it were one-shot, when in fact it's more than likely around 8-12 long takes. It truly creates an environment in the theater that will be hard to replicate. And even the lead performances and bit parts from well-known actors are extremely well handled and meticulously crafted. Make no mistake, 1917 is an absolute masterpiece.10/10",10,2,8,14 January 2020
Sing Street," For Brothers Everywhere
","Music is one of the driving forces of a motion picture. It can set the mood or ruin the mood in the blink of an eye. I've always been fascinated by that, and Sing Street is a great example of how music and the moments of discovering young adulthood can completely change your life.2016 has been a great year for film. Yes, some of the blockbusters and the films we had on our 'most anticipated' lists have definitely let down, but there have been some dang good movies this year. Sing Street may very well be the best that 2016 has to offer. It's the third feature film by John Carney, who's starting to become one of my favorite directors, and it follows along the music path that he chose for his first two features. I have yet to see 'Once', but I have seen 'Begin Again', and it grows on me every time I catch it on TV. Carney has a way of using music to not only set the mood, but to drive home major themes and ideas through the lyrics of a catchy song. Sing Street definitely has catchy songs, but it has an even better story and message.His films communicate using music, and when such a thing is done right in movies, it's extremely powerful and moving. Carney chose to cast unknown and relatively inexperienced actors for the band members, and that choice proved to be effective as well. There's something to be said about following a group of actors who you have no previous recollection of, and just seeing where the story goes. In many ways, this film felt real. It felt like these kids were actually from the 80's and making a tribute song to the bands that they were listening to at the time. It's truly special.One of the quotes on the cover of the DVD is from Irish megastar, Bono. He claims that 'In truth, most films won't touch Sing Street's portrayal of awakening.' He's right. There haven't been many films that have come close to Sing Street's portrayal of discovery and having dreams when no one else seems to allow you to. Perhaps 'Almost Famous' is the only other film that feels this genuine when it comes to the world of music.Although the band members and Lucy Boynton's Raphina character are likely to be the topic of conversation, I think Jack Reynor is the clear standout here. It's by far the meatiest role in the film, but Reynor stands up to the task, and gives perhaps the best performance of his career. I will no longer think of him as the guy from Transformers 4 (yikes), he's now that cool brother from Sing Street. I was blown away.Not many people can say they were in a band, but I think we can all say we did something crazy for someone we liked. The premise is based around a boy starting a band to an impress a girl, and that's something we can all relate to. On one hand, that angle is interesting enough, but what really fascinated we was how Carney turns a love story into a film about self-discovery and the power you feel when you have created something special. To me, John Carney has created something special in his own right here.+Carney does it again+Fresh actors bring a strong likability+Reynor+Catchy songs with a heartwarming story10/10",10,1,2,27 September 2016
Garden State," Solid Film About Self Discovery
","When I think of coming of age movies of the last decade, there are several movies that come to mind, and quite possibly Garden State will be in that list. The film does a good job at capturing the time in your life when you are in between school and the real life and still trying to figure out your priorities in life. I really like how Zach Braff directed and wrote this movie. Even though it feels like a lot of other self discovery films, he brought something new to the table.Having Natalie Portman as the lead female is also never a bad choice. Portman is one of the few actresses that bring a tremendous amount of realism to her characters. And she may very well have the best crying face in Hollywood. Her quirky Sam character perfectly complimented Braff's Andrew. Their chemistry is apparent right from the first scene together all the way to the last airport scene. Although I think the ending was one of the few major weak points the movie had. I was also a bit confused on the whole day-dreaming sequence up until the final scene when it started to come together.Peter Sarsgaard was also a good fit with the cast. I'm glad that he didn't turn into just another druggie, and actually had depth to his character. The father felt rather flat to me, and even in the bedroom scene, I didn't feel much compassion for the man. But the real gems are the scenes just between Sam and Andrew. I think for that reason alone is why this film is constantly on top movies of the 2000's lists. What I really enjoyed about this movie, is that it's basically genre-less. It's not a true romance, comedy, drama or adventure. It's simply a pretty good movie about life.+Chemistry between Braff & Portman +No genre +Relatable life situations-Ending falls flat -One note dad character 7.7/10",7,1,1,3 July 2014

Big Hero 6," Baymax Deflate!
","Disney is clearly in a new renaissance with Wreck-It Ralph, Frozen, and now Big Hero 6. In fact, it's almost impossible to tell sometimes whether it's a Disney animation or Pixar film. And I was really impressed with Big Hero 6. I cant believe I waited almost a month to go out and see this one. It's not the best Disney animated film, or even the most creative. But it is entertaining from start to finish and a film that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages.They introduce us to Hiro as a bot fighter who doesn't really have a home. Not literally, he lives with his brother and aunt. But he doesn't quite fit in with anybody and doesn't know how to put his talents to good work without getting into a little bit of trouble. Even though it was by the numbers Disney, I really liked his character arc. That's one of the many things that impressed me with Big Hero 6, it's not that different from any film we have seen, especially Disney, yet it brought so much joy and entertainment to the screen. But let's face it, the best part of the movie was Baymax. Last year Olaf and now Baymax. Talk about memorable characters and flat out hilarious physical comedy. Much like Olaf, his physical appearance brings a smile and chuckle to every motion (or attempt at motion) he gives us.There's one particular scene which Baymax attempts to squeeze through a window and my sisters and I were unable to control ourselves it was so hilarious. I missed at least a minute of dialog because I had to literally wipe the tears from my face and recover from the last minute of laughing out loud. The rest of the team served heir purpose. I cant say that all of their jokes hit or even found them memorable. In fact I'm not sure I remember their names, but they still helped create a fun universe for us to enjoy for (hopefully) years to come. The film does get pretty dark at times and even borders a kids movie at times but I really cant complain with the results. I had a lot of fun at the theater and I can say it was well worth the ticket price.+Baymax +Hysterical +Set's up a universe +For all ages -By the numbers-Supporting characters need improvements 8.6/10",8,29,43,5 December 2014
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Rehash
","No matter the genre, a second film in the franchise is always expected to up the ante. Whether that entails expanding the scope and scale or just developing your characters to a new point of awakening is up to each film individually. Resident Evil Apocalypse adds nothing new to what the first film already established. In fact, besides a slight setting change and some new faces, this is the exact same movie.It's unfortunate that Milla Jovovich got so tied up with the Resident Evil films for all those years. She's a talented actress, and quite good in the movies, but she's never given much to do besides wear inappropriate clothing (especially in an apocalypse) and throw some punches. Alice's character arc is the same as the first film. She initially finds herself estranged to her surroundings, she finds companions, punches are thrown, guns are shot, bad people try to take her and shake her world to the core, and then she revolts. It's quite laughable.For whatever weaknesses the first film had, at least it felt original and grounded with reality. 'Apocalypse' has a ton of action and new set pieces, both of which may wow the casual film-goer, but those sequences are constantly tied down by fast and lazy editing. A lot of films in the mid-2000's fell victim to jump cut fight scenes where you don't actually know who's punching who, you just get caught up in the excitement. With 'Apocalypse', not only do you not know who's punching who, you honestly don't care where the punches are landing anyway. It's not that I overtly disliked any of the new characters we were introduced to, such as Jill Valentine, Carlos Olivera, Angie Ashford, L.J., or Terri. But I found nothing unique or interesting about them, especially compared to the original gang in the first film.Sure, Jovovich is always entertaining to watch as Alice, but with nothing new added since the last outing, I can't possibly give the film a positive review.+Jovovich keeps it watchable-Lazy editing-Rehashed plot-Nothing unique about the new team4.4/10",4,0,4,23 January 2017
Mulholland Drive," Silencio
","Every film doesn't have to be Transformers 4, where there is absolutely no substance or meat to the product, sometimes we get films like Mulholland Drive, where I do more thinking before and after this movie than I have done for the last 15 movies I have seen combined. David Lynch has always been one for secrecy so I'm not sure we will ever get the true meaning of Mulholland Drive. But I think that's okay, I mean it's good to have multiple interpretations of a film in general. For me, I'm not entirely sure I know the truth, but I can try.It's basically a story of hopeful and broken dreams in Hollywood. Not only is it a commentary on how we think it all works but it's a maniacal thriller about not getting recognition for what you think you have accomplished in life. It plays with reality and the fictionalized versions of what we hope reality was or is. Naomi Watts plays the lead role, Diane Selwyn, a hopeful actress who is wishing for her break or chance to shine in Hollywood. The film also deals with the depths at which you would go to succeed and be noticed. Watts brings so much range to this character. Sure she technically plays both Betty and Diane so it calls for separate personalities. But it's not an obvious change. I think that's the most important part of her performance is that she exposes just the right amount of madness and sadness when needed. It's crazy to think about how the first half of the film is pretty much fake. It's all a reality or dream that Diane creates to see her life how she hopes it would have been and to see Camilla as Rita, a much better fit as a love interest.I basically see this film as the love child as 3 films. It has the story telling and narrative structure as Pulp Fiction, the hopeful then broken dreams of Sunset Blvd., and the descent into madness and suffering like Black Swan displays. Lynch creates a masterpiece of a film but also one that I don't know I will ever want to watch again. Whether it's the maliciously laughing old people or the monster like hobo, Mulholland Drive is one of the more disturbing films I have seen. Not that I read but it's like a book you don't want to put down but are terrified to find out what happens next. Knowing it's a David Lynch film means it's not going to have a happy ending or meaning. Instead it's a bit of a cynical view on Hollywood or what we thought Hollywood was. I love the way Lynch uses the camera as an extra character following around the story to create both more suspense and a certain amount of familiarity with this world. We are going to look back at this film decades from now and realize how incredible it was. The surrealism Lynch brings to the story creates both the promising reality we want for Diane and the tragedy we feared for Betty. It's a beautiful disaster film at it's core. I commend this film for daring to be so different than anything we have really seen before and shout out to Profiles (with Malone and Mantz) for pushing me to see this film. A true masterpiece.+Watts' range +Commentary on the industry +Impeccably written and directed +Surrealism Descent into madness 9.2/10",9,2,3,28 March 2015
Grave of the Fireflies," Beautifully Tragic
","Animated films are usually made for kids. And besides the occasional Toy Story or Lego Movie, you don't get animated films that actually appeal more to adults or young adults than to young children. But Grave of the Fireflies is definitely a film aimed at older people. It tells the story of a brother and a sister in the wake of several bombings in Japan during the second world war and the struggle for both of them to survive on their own without their parents. It's as dark as any animated film that I have seen and without giving anything away, the film doesn't really get any better for our main characters. It's just an incredibly devastating look at the other side to the war and how terrible many peoples lives got.The film begins by telling us the main character is going to die at a very young age. Then only a few minutes later do we see piles of bodies burned to ashes from the bombs. Setsuko, the young girl, and Seita, her older brother, try and work their way through what has become a Japanese wasteland and make the most out of their conditions. I really got the 'Life is Beautiful' vibe from the film. Seita is constantly trying to keep Setsuko as happy as possible as their mother was killed during the bombings and the father is nowhere to be found. The bond between them is well represented and easily believable which makes it even more devastating as their conditions deteriorate as the film progresses.I will say the film's English voice-overs could have been better. There were certain times early on that I feel like the timing and the tone of the way the characters presented their feelings to each other were off. The aunt seemed to make certain character decisions that had no merit because of the lack of back-story. I just felt like that character felt contrived in the film's plot and was doing things specifically to move the plot along. But other than that, I didn't have really any complaints with the film.+Beautiful even at it's most devastating moments +Sibling bond+Different take on the animation genre -English voice-overs and the aunt character 8.2/10",8,1,2,10 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," We Are What They Grow Beyond. That is the True Burden of All Masters.
","It's incredibly difficult to write a regular review for a film like this without spoiling anything. So I'm going to come right out and say that this will be a SPOILER heavy review. Last warning.So there's a lot to unpack with The Last Jedi. Unlike The Force Awakens, I had slightly different feelings on The Last Jedi upon second viewing. This is far from the rapidly paced and fun feel of The Force Awakens a few years ago. Which, on one hand, is an exciting new territory for this universe to explore. Rian Johnson certainly makes some homages to the films that came before, but this definitely takes the direction of the series into a bold new direction. And there are some seriously bold things Johnson does in this movie. However, on the other-hand, I loved the tone and feel of TFA in 2015 so much that I was taken aback with The Last Jedi's choices after my first watch.But let's get right into a more detailed conversation. The film picks up with a pretty thrilling space battle as The First Order is closing in on taking down the last bits of The Resistance/Republic. This is where we find Poe Dameron, who notably didn't get a lot of screen time in The Force Awakens, gets plenty of time to shine here. He becomes the source for where we get a lot of the political/strategic/military decisions with him, Leia, and newbie Vice Admiral Holdo. Out of the few new faces we see in The Last Jedi, I thought Laura Dern's performance as Holdo was probably the one I appreciated the most. Ultimately, these scenes could have been better character builders for Poe and Leia, but alas Leia was sidelined for a good portion of the movie after nearly dying. Being that Carrie Fisher suddenly passed away last year, I would have liked to have seen more of her in this go around. Though I will say the moment she gets to use the force and bring herself back into the ship was a nice scene that I never thought I would get.Meanwhile, Finn and other new character, Rose, are on a mission of their own to find a codebreaker to sneak them onto Snoke's ship and disable the trackers for the Rebel's ships (or some sort of technical thing). The point being that this whole side arc is easily the weakest aspect of the film by far. Finn, who was such a fresh presence in TFA and played so nicely alongside Rey, has nice chemistry with Rose, but these scenes are ultimately pointless. You can cut this entire sequence out of the film and still have the essentials amidst a quicker and more fluid film-going experience. The only reason to even keep them in the film is to set up the broom-boy at the end who can apparently use the force, which in itself was a hugely problematic reveal at the end of the film. I'm telling you, these scenes nearly killed the film at that particular point in the runtime. Luckily, we had absolutely incredible moments that followed. While all of that was going on, Rey tried her best to lure Luke Skywalker back into the fight against the dark side as he spends his last days on a lonely Island with Porgs. Everything with Rey, Luke, and/or Kylo Ren in this film was pure gold. I love seeing Luke be amazed over Rey's raw power and Rey desperately try to persuade Luke into returning. Their training sequences and moments of intimate dialogue rest as some of the best the series has ever bolstered. Mix that in with a brilliantly timed callback to the 'help me Obi-Wan Kenobi' scene, and a surprisingly effective cameo from the Jedi Master Yoda, made for some all-time great Star Wars singular scenes.Going along with that was the expansion of the Jedi and force mythos. For the most part, I loved the way this film expanded that lore, whether that be with Rey and Kylo using the force to communicate with each other or even Luke using the force to fake teleport. It was all fantastic and deepened the mythology for J.J. Abrams to further explore in Episode IX. Daisy Ridley is magnetic as Rey, who turns out to be child of no one particular of note (which I liked). And Adam Driver, who I had mixed feelings about in TFA, I thought portrayed an emotionally damaged villain very well. There's still those moments of occasional unnecessary yelling with him, but I feel much better about him now than I did a few years back.Which brings me to the insanely bold choices from Johnson/Lucasfilm of killing off both Snoke and Luke in this film. The scene in which Rey and Kyle team up to take down Snoke is Star Wars twists at its best. The slow motion shot of the two of them back to back fighting off Snoke goons was terrific. Only to be complemented by another twist with Kylo staying on the dark side and recruiting Rey. Absolutely loved that entire sequence. Luke's death was an interesting one because I still feel like there's a missed opportunity by never having a scene with him and Snoke together, or really just giving anything else in terms of Snoke's backstory, but it's hard to think of a more emotionally satisfying end to the legend of Luke Skywalker.I'm a bit torn on the humor, sometimes it really works sometimes it really doesn't. The middle act trudges along because of an out of place social message sequence which doesn't add anything to the film overall. And there's about 10 times this film could have ended. Those are my 3 gripes and it's difficult to even put into a number what those weaknesses mean for the score I'm going to give it. But The Last Jedi is a bold film and likely one that will continue to grow on me upon viewing 3, 4, etc. It will be very interesting to see where Episode IV take us, but these are my initial thoughts.9.0/10",8,2,16,15 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Hooked On a Guardian
","This is flat out the funniest Marvel movie to date, and the most daring property they have brought to grace the silver screen. It takes the Marvel universe from strictly earth heroes to thugs, thieves, and assassins that are forced into becoming heroes. Upon announcing the film would go into production last year, I was very worried that it drastically shift the current tone of the universe and in return not bring enough audience into the theaters to see the film. Well I was wrong on both fronts. The trailers sold it as a space epic that doesn't take itself too seriously. Which is exactly what it turned out to be. Films that are self aware are smartest. Plus when a film has a talking raccoon who shoots rockets how serious can it be? The cast was absolutely perfect. Chris Pratt is a star who has some of the best comedic timing in the business. Zoe Saldana is as BA as Scarlett Johansson is as Black Widow. Dave Bautista was a pleasant surprise as Drax for a wrestler turned actor. And how can I forget Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel as Rocket and Groot respectively, who by the way steal the entire film. I was pretty surprised at how little some of the supporting characters were in the film though. Glenn Close, Djimon Hounsou, John C, Reilly, and Benicio Del Toro were basically cameo roles. I did think Ronan was pretty one note and a typical superhero villain. Much like Malekith in Thor, Ronan lacked relatable characteristics and wasn't nearly as charismatic or intimidating for that matter as I would have liked.The whole film looks beautiful but I will say I would have liked to see more of Xandar and it's people. The people in this galaxy never look like the next person, which does throw you off a little bit. Like I said, this is one of the strangest superhero movies, and movies in general that I have seen. Id like to think I know a lot about Marvel characters but there are so many characters in this film that I had no clue who they were. So for the general audience, it may seem a bit too distant from other superhero movies for their liking.For as great as each of the guardians were and how many great one liners there were between the 5, I don't think there's one big action scene that I will remember from this movie. The film itself is most definitely memorable but with these big superhero movies you always think of the action scenes. With Avengers it's the assemble scene fighting the chitari. With The Dark Knight it's the truck flip. With X-Men it's Magneto hovering with sentinels. And with Man of Steel it's the Smallville fight and the neck snap. Guardians will be remembered more for it's great laughs which is fine, but it's something to improve upon for round 2.So overall I really enjoyed this summer blockbuster and it's quite the movie-going experience. I think it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone and the great thing is you don't have to have seen any previous Marvel movie to understand the plot. I brought my girlfriend, who hadn't seen a single Marvel film to date and she had a blast with it. I am sure I will be seeing it at least one more time. By the way, I was stunned they went the route they did with the after credits scene.+Funniest superhero movie to date +Brings Marvel to the cosmos! +Groot and Rocket are incredibly charming and lead a perfect cast +Self aware+Everything looks beautiful +Memorable soundtrack -No defining action sequence -Ronan was bleh 8.7/10SECOND VIEWING 9.0/10",9,3,6,1 August 2014
The Imitation Game," 159 Million With 18 Zeros
","You always think of war heroes as the ones who fight with guns and tanks. They even had a holiday named after them. But truly the word hero is much broader than that. There are so many heroes that go unnoticed for years until there is a movie made about them. I really had no idea the type of effort that people went through in order to crack the unbreakable code. Benedict Cumberbatch gives an extraordinary performance as, Alan Turing, the leader of the mathematicians who absolutely changed the war for the better.Cumberbatch is a revelation as Turing. We all know he is capable of grabbing our attention in whatever role he's in, but I did question his ability to lead an entire Oscar bait film. Well, I think that question can be put to rest. There is so much range to his performance that will surely make him a great Doctor Strange. But the supporting cast is also terrific. Charles Dance brought an undeniable presence to one of Turing's bosses. Matthew Goode won me over, as I was never a huge fan of his. But Keira Knightley gave what was probably her best performance of her career. It takes two charismatic leads to tackle the roles of Alan and Joan. These people were unbelievably intelligent, but I also appreciate the film touching on some of their flaws.I had no idea the amount of odds that were stacked up against them to crack the enigma code. The film said that it's worth 20 million years worth of data settings, and they have to crack it in 20 minutes. They only had a certain amount of time before the Germans would change the code and then all of their work goes to waste. Not only do they have to be intelligent but they have to be mentally stable under these pressures. I guess it really is the people you don't imagine doing the unimaginable things. I may have botched that quote, but the premise is the same.Alexandre Desplat had a terrific score, that is probably the only score this year that I wouldn't argue winning over Interstellar. I'm still humming the beautiful theme hours later. It contributed to the heartbreaking reality that was illegal to be homosexual during this time. Much like Selma, this film opened my eyes to the unimaginable things that humans did, and are capable of. I cant believe that he was given drugs in order to treat his 'illness'. The only real problem with the movie is that tries to give several special effects scenes that are a little too ambitious for a lower budget film. But Alan Turing is one of the true heroes of the war and saved over 14 million lives and shortened the war over 2 years. It's an inconceivable story that is worth everyone's time.+Cumberbatch's range +Supporting cast +Beautiful theme by Desplat+Unbelievable story -Special effects 8.9/10",8,2,6,1 February 2015
The Evil Dead," Cult Classic
","It's always fun to go back and watch films with a mass-cult following. Perhaps no horror film in history has a bigger cult following than The Evil Dead, and rightfully so. Director Sam Raimi and the small cast made one of the most intense and original films to date.Sometimes it's hard for myself to go back and watch horror films from decades ago, especially those with a smaller budget. Most of the time the lack of sufficient funds to edit horror pictures make the end product a lot less re-watchable. With The Evil Dead, the one-setting and minimalistic story actually adds to the film and makes it all the more terrifying. Yes, 5 friends spending a night in a secluded cabin in the middle of the forest with little lighting is unsettling, but with Raimi's amateur directing style, it's horrifying.Of course, I mean amateur with the best intentions. This was essentially a film funded using what we call 'kick-starter' now, with a bunch of his friends. Bruce Campbell being the one friend who went on to do extensive acting. Although Raimi didn't have the proper funds necessarily, there's actually a lot more skillful directing than you may think. You imply just have to look at the effective camera placement in suspenseful sequences to know this guy had a future in the filmmaking industry.The first act of the film is played out a lot like an old Hitchcock suspense thriller. It's all about 'what you don't see' that make the hairs raise on the back of your neck. Until the film changes into a contained gore fest for the last hour which is among the best slasher pictures of the 80's. The dialogue and acting isn't all that great but it makes for a solid B-movie atmosphere, which was common for plenty of horror films of that time. It's great on its own, but the story behind the making of the film certainly certifies this as one of horror-cinema's crown jewels.+You can already see Raimi's talent+One cabin, one forest, one friend group+Atmospheric -Dialogue8.2/10",8,0,1,19 September 2016
Jerry Maguire," Loyalty Without Intimacy
","Cameron Crowe is a genius. Every movie is made to make an audience member feel something. Whether it be laughter, horror, entertainment, or maybe just to be feel good. I simply don't think there is a better director at just making you feel good about life. He must be a tremendously happy person or maybe just too optimistic. No matter, I love his movies. Some would argue that at times his films feel too happy and perhaps unrealistic, to that I say nonsense. I don't mean nonsense as in they are completely invalid, the arguments have a point. I just don't think that always matters. Movies are made to be enjoyed and entertained by, and Crowe almost always comes through there.Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who is down on his luck after being fired and is left with only one client who still stands by him. But what it's really about is a man with major intimacy issues, who learns how to enjoy life with his heart more than with his wallet, or lack there of. It's pretty much Tom Cruise's quintessential role and one that he very well could have won an academy award for. Cruise not only brings some surprisingly well timed comedy, but a great amount of heart and realism to Jerry. Renee Zellweger also has a career defining performance as Dorothy Boyd, a single mom and a co-worker of Jerry. Crowe has a knack for creating great chemistry between romantic co-stars. Zellweger and Cruise are great together, along with the hilarious son of Boyd, Ray. It's the scenes with all three of them that really touched me in a way that only some films do. Not to mention just how funny the three of them, particularly Ray are in the film. For a film that isn't straight comedy, it made me laugh a whole lot.With Cameron Crowe you also get a great soundtrack and score. Nancy Wilson does an impeccable job scoring at the right times, and the soundtrack choices couldn't be more spot on with the various moments throughout. But it's also Crowe's ability to make an admittingly predictable film feel fresh and re-watchable. He surrounds the wonderful main cast of Cruise, Gooding Jr, and Zellweger, with standouts Regina King and Bonnie Hunt. The writing, music, and direction are all top of the line as Jerry Maguire is simply one of the most enjoyable films I have seen recently. To go along with the fact that being a huge sports fan, it was fascinating to see how the agent business may work. Of course, the film is famous for the endlessly quotable lines, but I feel like the enjoyment of life is what I'm going to take from it, and really how little money can mean in the grand scheme of things.+Cruise at his absolute best +Real romance +Quotable lines +The kid is hilarious +Great sports film +Supporting cast -A little bit predictable9.7/10",9,0,0,15 May 2015
Jurassic World," Welcome Back
","People who say that nothing is original in Hollywood have an argument. I mean we live in a world where Vacation, Ben Hur, Mad Max, and Jurassic Park are all getting remade, re-quels, or long overdue sequels. There aren't many studios who pull the trigger on an unknown property, so here we have Jurassic World. A sort of sequel to the previous films, but more so just a film that calls back to the original but ignores the events of the next two. Is it better than the original? No, probably not. But it's definitely not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, I really enjoyed the film. I know some people will still take issue with the fact that there's no reason there even should have been more than one film. Why are people still making dinosaurs? It's a good question. But if you just look at the film as more of a monster movie and not compared to the original classic, I think you will have a good time.Set 22 years after the events of the original, Jurassic World has the island as a full time theme park, just as John Hammond had hoped. But as people are growing tired of seeing dinosaurs, scientists create a new hybrid dinosaur as a way to boost attendance. Chris Pratt stars as a Velociraptor trainer, while Bryce Dallas Howard stars as one of the heads of the theme park. There's a lot to like about the film. Pratt is a true movie star and the films action was actually better than I expected. There's also several nods and callbacks to the original film. But I think the film suffers in it's lack of unpredictability and even in the lack of animatronics. The old films used real props in close up shots and only used CGI when needed. I just feel like at times it felt like there was an abundance of CGI where there didn't need to be. And as cool as the final fight was with the new dinosaur, I would have liked to have seen more of the genetics side of the story. I feel like that side of the film was glazed over within a few minutes.But the film is beautiful. It's fascinating seeing the island as an actual theme park attraction just as Hammonds vision called for. Hearing John Williams vivacious score (now done by Michael Giacchino) as a backbone to the gorgeous scenery is an added bonus. I also love the idea that people are getting bored of seeing dinosaurs. I mean they're frickin dinosaurs! The film also gives us some great humor as well, but not as much from Chris Pratt as you would think. But Jake Johnson perhaps has the most memorable performance, playing the Samuel L. Jackson-esque character from the original. But we watch these films to be entertained. And Jurassic World definitely entertains. Maybe not as much of the immense tension that the original had, but the dino-fights are top notch and ended with a fantastic climax. Yes, the people who you think die, die. But the film is loaded high octane thrills and enough humor to keep your eyes pealed. I could have done without the clichéd romance and even the predictable kids side story. But I wasn't let down with Jurassic World.+Great finale +Pratt and Johnson's humor +Beautiful landscape & score+Fresh enough idea to feel necessary -Cliched romance -Too much CGI7.6/10",7,7,18,14 June 2015
Silence," Scorsese's Passion Project
","We're lucky to have this film in theaters. Martin Scorsese worked to get it made for close to 30 years. While I can't fault the importance or overall uniqueness, the final product isn't exactly the easiest to connect to.Scorsese makes notoriously long epics. Most of the time, I enjoy the length and they can even leave me wanting more. The man is just that good at filmmaking. He's also consistently produced some of the most memorable scripts, whether they're written by him or someone else, over the last several decades. Silence contains some 'best of' Scorsese for sure; including a maniacal but fleshed out antagonist, several brutally relentless scenes, and some magnificent performances. But I'm not sure this ranks near a top 10 list for his career as an overall feature.Not starring Leonardo DiCaprio nor Robert De Niro, Scorsese got Andrew Garfield, Adam Driver, and Liam Neeson to head this historical epic dealing with two Jesuit priests and their trek to find their mentor in faith, who they refuse to believe has apostatized. Especially during a time when Christianity was banned in Japan, this voyage is a fascinating trial of faith and reserving what you believe in, even if it means torture or death. A similarly themed movie, Hacksaw Ridge, also starring Andrew Garfield was released earlier this year. Both movies are well-made, brilliantly acted (although I think Garfield was better in Hacksaw), gorgeously shot, and portrayed thought provoking themes and ideas throughout.With that said, I don't think Silence is as interesting as it could have been. With a glaringly slow pace, by the end of the film you are so drained with the experience of these two priests that it's hard to want to spend any more time thinking about the story at hand. I also found it a little difficult to connect to the characters, because of how far we are removed from that time-period. Some can certainly say that some of the same belief issues are going on in today's world, which is fair, but the aesthetic of mid 1600's Japan felt very separated from our world. Which I guess, can also be contributed as a compliment to Scorsese's ability to transport you to a different era via set design and cinematography.I liked Silence. I think it brings up interesting questions involving faith and showcased what was once a world torn by religion pretty flawlessly. I just wish it was easier to connect with the characters, the run-time cut down, and the pacing be picked up.+You get a feel for what this world was like to live in+Fascinating themes+Brutal-Slow burn-Besides a few memorable scenes, the characters needed to be easier to connect to7.3/10",7,0,2,16 January 2017
Logan," The Perfect Send-Off to a Legendary Run as Wolverine
","The main issue with the first two Wolverine films were that they weren't Logan's stories. Stories that just happened to star Hugh Jackman with claws and healing ability. Luckily, James Mangold rights the ship with 'Logan'. Deservingly brutal and heartbreaking, 'Logan' is the perfect send-off for Hugh Jackman's 17-year tenure playing the character.'Logan' accomplished one of the hardest things the third in a trilogy can do, get better with every outing. But 'Logan' isn't just better than the previous two Wolverine films, it's one of the greatest comic-book films of all time. Ironically, besides a few references and the appearance of an actual X-Men comic, it's far from your usual run of the mill comic-book adventure. 'Logan' sees a man just waiting for his time to come while taking care of the man who once took care of him, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). It's beautiful symmetry that way, as is the appearance of the clone, X- 23/Laura. Laura, equipped with the same healing ability and adamantium clones as Wolverine, makes for a nice counterpart to Logan. And really, all 3 main characters have great chemistry as some of the few mutants left in the world.Neither Jackman or Stewart has ever been better as their respected mutants. Giving these characters their own mortality is the best thing the script could have done. It's one of the reasons people have given up on most superhero-related films, they tend to be predictable and without consequence. Yes, it's always been fun to watch Wolverine rip through dozens of bad guys without a second glance, but it's about time we see his body struggle as much as his mind has through the years. Losing all the people he has through nine films doesn't exactly put his mind in the best place.Which is why having Laura be in this film is so integral. Logan needed to see someone with similar abilities, but at a time where she needs guidance and a father-figure. Which again, mirrors Logan's first trip to the X-mansion back in 2000's X-Men. Which brings me to the next brilliant thing about 'Logan'. It's uniqueness make seeing all of the previous X-Men films only recommended viewing. It's connected in a way, but you don't need to see the other films in order to feel the weight of every moment. With that said, knowing everything that this character has gone through certainly enhances the experience. Without spoiling the 3rd act, I don't think there will ever be anything quite like 'Logan'. Perhaps not since the ending of The Dark Knight Trilogy have I felt this kind of emotion.It's been well documented just how ultra-violent 'Logan' is, but I never felt the violence over took the characters and story. For once, we got a Wolverine story that was actually his own story, and it paid off. I don't need to see any more of Wolverine in the X-Men universe, at least for a long time. I got the violence and emotional payoff that I wanted from this character. Words cannot describe this experience, and only time will tell just how well this film holds up.+Perfect send-off+Separated from the universe but honors what came before+Laura/X-23+Ultra-violent+Mortal Wolverine and Professor X10/10",10,3,7,4 March 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," The Beginning to the End
","This is why I love going to the movies. For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.We open with the Avengers mid mission taking down Baron Von Strucker and the experimented on Maximoff twins. As the camera seamlessly weaves through the entire team we get Brian Tyler's brilliantly mixed score, which I was thrilled to hear they salvaged some of Silvestri's theme, that goes with each character. It was like the assemble moment from the first film was happening again within the first 5 minutes, you just don't get much better than that. We quickly get introduced to Scarlet Witch's nightmarish powers with Tony seeing his future of the Avengers dying at his own hands. I do feel like that's a quick nod to Civil War and the possibility of the team going separate ways. Iron Man started it all, so it does seem like the beginning to the end. Throughout the film we get to see different nightmare sequences that give us glimpses of Heimdall played by Idris Elba and the Ragnarok storyline. With Cap we briefly saw Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and a little bit of the dance we never got to see. Finally with Black Widow and her harsh upbringings as an assassin. On a side note it was cool seeing Julie Delpy in the flashbacks.Onto the possibly the most fun segment of the film, the party scene. Not only did we get several laugh out loud jokes, we had jokes that I missed because everyone was still laughing from before. I'm not even sure Guardians was able to do that. The scene with Thor's hammer was especially entertaining. The look on Thor's face when Cap is able to slightly move it was priceless. Ultron's entrance is terrifying but also sort of funny? I wasn't expecting the humor to Ultron, and I'm not sure I needed it. Don't get me wrong James Spader was fantastic as the voice, but I think at times it didn't fit. The film does indeed go from one action scene too another, and if this isn't your type of movie, I don't blame you if it feels tiresome. But it never bored me as I don't think there will be a more fun movie this year. It's not like action is all we got, we were introduced to a new romance with Hulk and Widow. It's no Gwen and Peter or Pepper and Tony, but I liked the dynamic. Whedon definitely made us care more about each character this time around, as even Hawkeye became a bada**.As a safe house, we were taken to Hawkeye's real home. It was a nice break from the action to spend time with real people without any powers. Hawkeye was just overall a much better character here. After Vision awakens with the mind gem, we head to the final battle. I was glad that this time they were able to find a way to get people to safety, with help from Nick Fury, what an entrance by the way. With so many characters using everyone else's weapons in the battle, it made for one huge geek fest. But it goes to show you how much credit Whedon deserves for balancing all the screen time. Infinity War will be an even bigger challenge, good luck Russo bros. Speaking of that, Thanos' brief but menacing mid credits scene was cool and is a huge tease. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds now that we also have a New Avengers team, led by Cap. Sure Quiksilver wont be around but Vision was really cool and Scarlet Witch was electric so I'm really looking forward to it. Plus who doesn't love a little more Anthony Mackie as well? So there are definitely flaws to be talked about. Thor's detour midway through felt off, Ultron's humor is also out of place at times, and I can see where the action can be exhausting to some, and the amount of characters and cameos make it feel a little messy, but I just had so much fun at the movies. There are also times where things happen that feel like they should have a scene before, explaining it. I hope Joss Whedon puts out his extended 3hr long cut on the bluray. The film also feels at times that it sacrifices brains for action. But there's so much geek material here I don't think I can get too mad. I mean come on, who doesn't love that Hulkbuster fight!? I don't know how long superhero films will be around, so let's enjoy them while we can. What's next? Civil War is next, and I think you can already sense the tension between Cap and Tony. Sure, they end on good terms here, but they never really see eye to eye. Knowing how many are coming back (and possibly Spidey) gets me even more excited. It definitely seems like Avengers 2.5. Nevertheless, go experience this film in theaters.+Hawkeye is cool again +The main theme is back! +New characters turned out great +Hilarious gags +Ultron can be terrifying +New Avengers+Insane action -Some detours feel off -Ultron's humor was too out of place at times Critic score 9.5/10.

The Insider," The Lengths People Will Go to Hide the Truth
","When two legends of the silver screen join forces to act against one another, it's typically something special. The Insider provided just that, a visceral and relentless intense take on the Tobacco industry whistleblower, Jeffrey Wigand. Both Russell Crowe (Wigand) and Al Pacino (Lowell Bergman) do a great job of playing off each others strengths as characters and as actors. And really this film is a brilliantly poignant take on the lengths at which both sides will go (during a whistleblowing incident) to keep the truth hidden or revealed. The only thing I could have used a little bit more of is Wigand's reasoning behind why he should reveal to the world the truth behind this particular Tobacco. I got all the reasons and examples as to why he should keep his family safe (among many other things), but I feel like I didn't get enough from the movie as to why he should risk his life and come clean. Besides of course, the obvious reason being that it's the right thing to do. Other than that, The Insider is an impressive watch, and one that still rings relevant to this day.7.8/10",7,0,0,30 May 2018
Major League," Winning Heals All Wounds
","If there's any sport that makes for a great movie it's baseball. Perhaps I'm a little bias because I play the sport, but there's something about America's pastime that really hits home in the movies.Major League tells the made-up (but totally based on the real-life struggles of the Cleveland Indians) story of a group of misfits hired by a new owner to lose as many games as possible, to ensure her plan of moving the team down to Miami. On the outskirts, it seems like a ridiculous premise that would be something out of a spoof movie. But in reality, there's actually a good deal of dramatic heft to the story as well. Luckily, the comedy and drama both balance each other out quite well.With a memorable cast of misfits, including Charlie Sheen as the fireball pitcher Ricky Vaughn, Tom Berenger as the old but still effective Jake Taylor, Wesley Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes, Dennis Haysbert as the religious Pedro Cerrano, and of course the colorful Bob Uecker as the Indians play by play announcer. With all movies, but specifically with sports movies, you need a group of actors that have chemistry and feel like a team when they're together. Albeit extremely unconventional, the players that make up this Indians team are something else. And even though it seems like the characters are built around stereotypes, the way the actors portray them makes it never feel like stereotypical characters at all. Instead, they make for some of the most quotable lines in the history of sports films.With that said, the film definitely delves into some paint by numbers plot points for sports films. You have your ups, downs, and montages, just like all of the other great sports pictures. I also find it sometimes difficult to watch a sports film, baseball in particular, because the movies have a hard time capturing how a game flows and looks. There are moments that feel completely acted out and unnatural, and while I can give it a pass in some areas, others I can't. However, overall Major League is a fun and re-watchable sports film that gives us plenty of comedy and a surprising amount of dramatic payoff as well. P.S. It's funny how it's been 30 more years, and the Indians are still on their World Series drought.+Blend of comedy and drama+Memorable characters and performances-Predictable8.0/10",8,0,2,2 May 2017

The Dark Knight," Defined a Generation
","It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.Talk about a film that absolutely changed the game. Not only did this film change my life and my absolute love for film, it significantly impacted the way comic book movies and blockbusters in general are made. There's a reason this film is number 4 on IMDb's all time list. It's an awe inspiring movie. It was also the first movie I saw that made me really interested in film. It has the greatest movie villain of all time, one of the greatest scores of all time, and is quite possibly the greatest film ever made.Christopher Nolan and David Goyer gave us an incredible script to this grounded superhero flick. It's dark, brooding, and chaotic. Right from the opening robbery scene you knew this film would be a non-stop thrill ride. The Joker is the greatest villain of all time, but it's Heath Ledgers performance that made this movie. In my opinion it's the single greatest movie character and performance in film history. That's saying a lot, but Ledger truly lost himself in this role in a complete transformation. So much so that he overshadows Christian Bale's brilliant turn as Bruce Wayne/Batman. In many ways this was actually his toughest test in all three of the films. It's more personal than an entire city blowing up and more heartbreaking than watching his back break. Batman literally cant beat Joker in this movie. In fact it's one of the few comic book films where the hero really doesn't win in the end, because the chaos that Joker had wanted and promised did eventually occur.Michael Caine also gives a terrifically understated performance as Wayne's butler Alfred. His speech in the lair about Joker wanting to watch the world burn was just traumatic. Especially knowing the real life links with terrorism it makes this film just terrifying when you think about it. The interrogation scene is my favorite scene in movie history. Watching both these characters sit down and talk about how differently they see the world was fascinating. Joker pushes Batman to the limits as much as this movie did for comic book films. It brought a completely new fan base to the ever-growing comic book fans.Sure I still like The Dark Knight Rises a tad more because of it's epic conclusion to the trilogy but The Dark Knight will always be the film that introduced me to Christopher Nolan and the greatness of Hans Zimmer. So in a way this has become the most influential film of my life. It's a really important film to me that obviously had an impact on millions of people as well. I think years down the line this film will go down as one of the most important films of our generation as it's no doubt the best film of the 2000's decade.+Influential to my life +Ledger's Joker (greatest character in film history) +Perfect script and pacing to the film +Interrogation scene+Zimmer's iconic score +The ending 10/10",10,0,6,6 November 2014
Everest," On Top of the World
","With perhaps one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Everest is a solid disaster flick. The story of anyone climbing Mt. Everest is absurd to me, but this group had a particularly devastating adventure. Everest tells the story of a group of explorers in the mid 90's taking on the dangers of climbing the tallest mountain in the world before a deadly storm made them alter their plans mid trip. Led by the strong performances of Jason Clarke, Jake, Gyllenhaal, Josh Brolin, Sam Worthington, and Keira Knightley, Everest is one of the most impressive looking and acted films all year.The film starts out slow and I think for awhile didn't really know how to structure the story. With such a big cast and a ton to focus on, the film just doesn't flow for a good hour. In fact, it wasn't really clear who was in what expedition group for awhile, no thanks to them being covered with snow and snow gear for a good portion of the film. I think that's just the nature of this story though, no pun intended. I also thought it was interesting that we only really got back-stories for a few of them, and only two with family members show. But the scene in which each of them describe why they are going on this trip was where the film started to have the emotional edge that I had hoped initially. But you go to see a movie like this for the final 40 minutes or so. The ending picked up for the lackluster first hour or so and it turns out to be a solid film.Knightley and Clarke have great chemistry without really being on the screen together at all, along with Brolin and Robin Wright having a few memorable scenes together. Clarke is becoming one of the most underrated actors working today. The entire cast is magnificent though. Everyone sells everything they are doing incredibly well. The visuals are also very good for a 50 million dollar budget. If you forget about the weak first half of the movie than we may have had an Oscar contender on our hands.+Clarke's incredible performance+Visuals+Emotional pull-Weak and slow start7.7/10",7,6,11,27 September 2015
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," Harry Takes on the Leadership Role
","I'm sure it's difficult for any filmmaker to adapt a beloved novel, but David Yates had an extraordinary task attempting to cut down the longest Potter novel into what happens to be, the second shortest film in the series. I didn't read the books, so I can't specifically comment on the quality of the adaptation, but I do know that Order of the Phoenix is one damn good film.As much as I love the inevitable singular adventures each film in the Harry Potter series brings, I think Harry's emotional journey in each film is equally as intriguing. That journey is perhaps most drastic in Order of the Phoenix. After the horrific events at the end of Goblet of Fire, Hogwarts, its students, and the rest of the Wizarding World are at a split feeling surrounding the reemergence of Lord Voldemort. The ministry refuses to believe that that the dark lord has returned, while Harry and a select few at Hogwarts are truly preparing for what's to come.Harry faces a difficult case against him at the ministry after it's revealed to them that Harry used magic in the presence of muggles. It's another truly eerie opening as the dementors nearly killed Harry and Dudley. But Dementors are only the beginning to what is probably Harry's most difficult task in the series to that point, defeating the dark lord and his 'army' he's been recruiting.We've seen plenty of great adventures from the main trio thus far, so I guess it was about time the team expands a bit. Alas, Harry starts 'Dumbledore's Army' with the help of Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Neville, Cho, and the new cast member, Luna Lovegood among others. It's probably the first time in the series' history where Harry willingly takes on a leadership role in order to get ahead of Voldemort's plans. This all isn't taken too well from the newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge. Umbridge is easily one the easiest characters to hate in the series, but I can't picture anyone else bringing more to the role than Imelda Staunton did. It's a complicated character to like, but it fits in with the tone of the movie in a strangely satisfying way.Another strong point in The Order of the Phoenix is the impressive set design. Unlike Goblet of Fire, we get to spend much more time at Hogwarts as well as getting a look at a few new sets outside the campus. Just simply taking a look at the gorgeous cinematography and production design of the final showdown at the Department of Mysteries. To me, it's one of the finest sequences this series has ever given us. Seeing Harry and a good portion of his team take on the Death Eaters was cool, but nothing compares to Dumbledore (and sort of Harry) take on Voldemort. That along with the death of Sirius Black leaves the series on a satisfyingly somber note.It's difficult to compare this film to the others. There are aspects to the Order of the Phoenix that are great, like the climax and Harry's emotional arc, but it's hard to not feel like there's something missing from the story. You don't necessarily feel that way during the viewing, but perhaps looking back, it could have used an extra 15 minutes or so of scenes.+Production design +Harry's emotional arc +Dumbledore vs Voldemort+Harry takes on a leadership role -Could be an extra 15 minutes of plot to add 8.8/10",8,0,3,10 November 2016
Annie Hall," love fades
","Annie Hall is filmmaking at its best. Its Woody Allen at his best. And its a romantic comedy at its best. Instantly from the beginning it reminded me of the recent 500 days of summer. Not only because it basically gives away the ending from the opening scene, but because it did a lot for the rom-com genre as a whole. It has a lot to say for life, romance, and even to a certain extent death. But really the trademark of the film is that love fades, and it is extremely difficult for people to continue a relationship for a long period of time.Out of the small amount of Woody Allen movies I've seen I think this one might be my favorite. Allen is always good at writing characters that seem to work perfectly together even if on the outside it seems far fetched. Alvy and Annie don't seem like a regular couple in fact in real life I'm not sure their personalities fit. But for some reason it makes sense in the movie. The sense of realism that Allen brings to his characters is always refreshing. Everyone has flaws and sometimes in movies we fall in love with the perfect human being, when nobody is perfect, not even close. So when a filmmaker helps us realize that perfection shouldn't be expected for a relationship, you really appreciate the guts they have. Too often do we get our happy ending that isn't realistic at all.As Allen tells us from the opening scene, him and Annie aren't the same as they used to be. Love just fades, and there's not much we can do to stop that. We should just all hope we find the person that the love is everlasting instead. I think Diane Keaton was the best part about this film, and for me she created one of the coolest movie characters of that time. For many people, the parts of the movie that see the characters jump back in time and flat out talk to people is the funniest and most entertaining scenes. But in my opinion its the only time that I was taken out of the film. The movie has so much realism that when you throw in supernatural like elements it distances me.By the way the cameos from Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken were funny and random. The movie is highly re-watchable and is definitely one of the best romantic movies we've ever had.+writing and characters+Allen & Keaton chemistry-weird out of place flashback moments9.0/10",9,1,2,16 May 2014
Toy Story," 'Falling With Style'
","One of the few films that significantly shaped my childhood in loving films, Toy Story completely changed animation forever, and in my opinion for the better. In a mere 80 minutes, the film introduces us to a group of toys devoted to their beloved Andy and gets us to care about that relationship, to infinity and beyond. Everything from having 'Andy' written on the toy's boots, to the menace that was Sid the next door neighbor, to Randy Newman's transformative music, to the bond that was formed between Buzz and Woody, Toy Story is a magical time at the movies.10/10",10,1,1,22 June 2019
Midsommar," Unsettling Premise, but Stops Being Interesting After 30 Minute Mark
","The one thing I always come back to when thinking about both of Ari Aster's last few movies (Hereditary and Midsommar) is that I'm thrilled we still have filmmakers like him that bring a unique vibe to Hollywood films. Sometimes divisiveness can be bad and toxic, but in most cases, intelligent conversations are what makes this medium of art so special. And make no mistake, Midsommar is a piece of art. How much did I enjoy that piece of art? Well, that's a different answer. Slowly paced and seemingly forgetting the premise the first 15 minutes sets up, Midsommar finds itself stuck in a cult horror where most of the horror is off screen, as is anything interesting. Though admittedly, Florence Pugh turns in another fantastic turn as the lead.5.0/10",5,4,10,1 August 2019
Pride & Prejudice," Shines in performances, but not dazzling
","This was my first taste into the famous novel that is 'Pride and Prejudice', so I really didn't know what to expect. I wasn't thrilled but it's definitely an enjoyable watch. Knightley is easily the best part about this movie. Dench, Sutherland, and Macfadyen also have great moments throughout. But I found the mother to be incredibly annoying and unwatchable. I wouldn't agree with the tag line of 'Greatest love story of all time' but I did like the chemistry between actors. This movie really got me thinking about how lucky I am to not have to be involved with any traditions of 'Arranged Marriage'. I cant believe what people had to go through back then. This movie is a good watch no matter. On a side note, the score/main theme of this movie constantly reminded me of the Craig Armstrong 'Love Actually' theme. Just food for thought. Anyways, I would recommend this film, as it is a very satisfying period piece. 7.2/10",7,0,1,12 March 2014
Once Upon a Time in America," A once in a lifetime crime drama
","This is truly one of the great epic crime dramas in cinema history. This movie is the cream of the crop when it comes to writing, acting, and overall storytelling. Even with its long runtime, it engages you from the very beginning. Should we expect anything different from guys like Robert De Niro and Sergio Leone? Nope, but nonetheless its a cinematic achievement. It really builds one of the great friendships that I can remember in movies. James Woods and De Niro have impeccable chemistry and make us believe they really are friends. Major props go to the younger cast as well.One of the best parts about this movie is that it takes place in different time periods, and by the way the filming and cinematography makes you believe you are with them in that time. I really liked how they didn't tell it necessarily in chronological order. You see old De Niro, you see 30's De Niro and you see young young De Niro. It gives you more than a glimpse into his life at each point in time. The younger cast of the friends turned gangsters were great because they not only had great chemistry but they looked and acted just like there older selves. That's very hard to do in movies. I mean seriously the kids looked just like their older selves did. Jennifer Connelly anyone? It was great to see these characters go through their trials and tribulations as young adults together and see how if affected them in the future. The music was a major bright spot in the film as well. The score by Morricone captured the friendship and sometimes heartbreak between the group of friends. There are so many positives to this movie that I cant write enough.The length is just a minor problem but really its forgiven with how great the script is. But my one problem was the sometimes uncomfortable feeling that I had while watching this. There are scenes that really make you despise these characters and then you are all of a sudden suppose to feel for them in the end? That is one huge problem with doing villain movies, it becomes very hard to root for them in the end. I'm not saying these characters are villains, but the disgust that I had with some of them didn't make me have any sympathy when something would eventually go wrong for them.But a great watch that is filled with fantastic performances all around. And when you realize it's not even necessarily a gangster movie as it is a movie about gangsters who are great friends and are faced with difficult decisions in life.9.3/10",9,1,4,13 April 2014
Toy Story 2," 'Ride Like the Wind, Bullseye!'
","Of the original trilogy, Toy Story 2 has always been my least re-watched and least favorite, but that's not to say the film isn't a near all-around success. It's the film that really started to introduce the idea of mortality to the toy's shelf life. Woody is kidnapped by a toy collector and meets Jessie, Bullseye, and The Prospector, toys who just want to make it to Japan to be on display for the rest of their life. Jessie's backstory is among the best sequences Pixar has ever put to screen, the Woody's Round-Up scenes are magical, and the animation is far more detailed and intricate than the first. It's also much better on re-watch than I remember.9.5/10",9,2,4,22 June 2019
Frank," They'll Love Us
","What a strange film this is. When I first heard about a movie involving Michael Fassbender wearing a head piece for the entire film I was immediately intrigued. He's one of the best actors working today and although you don't get to see his face much, his acting chops definitely show.First of all, it's clear from the get-go that Fassbender has a lot of fun with this role. It's probably the most obscure one of his career but he transforms himself once again into Frank, this broken down artist who is frightened to ever show his face in front of people so he hides behind a mask 24/7. Domhnall Gleeson also gives another very good performance as the newest member of Frank's band who desperately wants to become popular in the music industry. The band is full of different personalities, who of course don't particularly get along and it ends up creating major conflicts with the goals of Gleesons character. After the band becomes increasingly popular, the films plot takes a few left turns that are a bit far fetched and it almost took me out of the movie. Gyllenhaal gives one of her weaker performances as she comes off as a little bit too annoying to have any sympathy towards her character.But the stranger the plot gets, the better the performances become. The film actually has a lot of heart and meaning behind all of the chaos. It tells us a lot about opening yourself up to potential failure because that's the only true way you will succeed. Perhaps the bands goals aren't ultimately fulfilled but the films message is. If it means something to you and your future endeavors, then the film does what it set out to do.+Fassbender in a completely different role +Meaningful and deep+Original -One too many left turns made -Gyllenhaal 7.2/10",7,0,1,22 December 2014
Selma," Enough Is Enough
","We still need these films. I have heard the arguments of 'this was so long ago' or 'racism is gone, we don't need to see this film'. I will tell you as a white man that neither of those arguments are valid. These events were only 50 years ago. In fact some people who took part in these events are still alive. It baffles me that people don't think Selma is an important film. Selma is the most powerful film I have seen this year. I saw it by myself, and it took me places emotionally that I don't think I have been before in a theater.First of all, major props to everyone involved in the making of this film. I know the Oscar nominations caused controversy on whether or not Selma should have been nominated for more awards, in particular, David Oyelowo and Ava DuVernay. Out of all the performances I have seen this year Oyelowo is definitely in the top 5. He embodies everything we know about Martin Luther King Jr, and even gives a little bit of spin on it. That's the other thing I loved about this film, I cant tell you how many very famous actors took these small parts, so they could be a part of this incredibly important film.I also liked that this wasn't necessarily just a Dr. King story. It told the story of the Selma march, and even quite a bit about some of the other important people involved in this famous event. Wilkinson played Johnson perfectly, as he was torn between changing the voting rights or not. But there were so many other incredible performances that could have been recognized. Even Oprah did a really nice job. But the film took it to another level once I saw the Selma march. Reading about such events in history books is one thing, but when you see what man is capable of in a graphic way was another thing completely. These people were just asking for their voting rights to be recognized and they were brutally beaten and murdered. The way DuVernay shot the film made it that much more devastating. Seeing shots of white men riding horses with guns and batons just wiping the bridge with the blood of these people was one of the most brutal things I have ever seen. I'm getting choked up just writing about it. I was literally shaking my head ready to yell at the screen when this happened.I don't think I have been that impacted by a film in a long time. The fact that it was only half a century ago is unbelievable. Oyelowo gave us some extraordinary speeches and the supporting cast was impeccable. DuVernay perfectly directed this and gave us one of the best films of the year. It's true though, schools should be required to show this when they go over the civil rights unit. It's a story that I was aware of but not to the extent that occurs over the course of these brutal 2 hours. Let's make sure these events never happen again.+Oyelowo's snubbed performance +Entire supporting cast +DuVernay's direction +Devastating march +Common & John Legend's 'Glory'+Educational 9.6/10",9,1,4,30 January 2015
La La Land," For the Dreamers
","There are two things that can really win me over in a movie; great music and a great ending. La La Land has both, and then some.Coming off of Whiplash, one of the best films of 2014, the pressure was on Damien Chazelle to come up with something to top what he did previously. Not only did he co-write 13 Cloverfield Lane earlier this year, but he finally got to direct his passion project, La La Land. In fact, the very plot of the film echoes Chazelle's relentless devotion to getting this film made all these years. And for the most part, the result is magical. Surely, there's nothing like it you will see this year. Like many classic musicals of the 40's and 50's, La La Land's narrative tends to wander into dreamy and surreal territories, but it's at its best when it is simply telling the story of two ambitious artists in Los Angeles, one a jazz musician and the other an aspiring actress. I think Chazelle's vision would have been fine with other actors, but there's no question that a ton of credit has to go to Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone. Their chemistry bolsters this story, and really, is why I cared so much about these characters. Both of them will be nominated and both of them deserve to be. Their relationship through triumphs and struggles, may be the best romance of the year.La La Land is one of those movies that doesn't really hit you until the car ride home, or even a few days after. Sometimes the wandering plot and the inconsistent presence of musical numbers is frustrating, but it all leads to one satisfying ending. So much so that I significantly upped my score because of how hard the ending hit me. It isn't predictable or easy, in fact, because the ending wasn't what I originally hoped, made me enjoy it even more. The final few shots gave me a whole movie's worth of emotion, and it made it worth it in the end.This is clearly a tribute to the musicals of the golden age of Hollywood and also a constant reminder at the brilliance of Jazz music, but I found the touching romance and struggle of these two artists to be the most rewarding aspect to La La Land. The beautiful score and equally subtle and swashbuckling songs contribute to one epic theater experience. I'm still processing how I feel about the film as a whole, but I'm certainly pleased that I saw it.+Stone & Gosling chemistry+Music+Unpredictable+Satisfying ending-Middle act wanders10/10",10,4,9,20 December 2016
Mama," Serviceable Horror Flick
","The first feature film from 2017's 'It' director, Andy Muschietti, 'Mama' is a visually striking but ultimately derivative when you think about it. Whether it be the story, visual cues, or plot twists and turns, Muschietti doesn't necessarily hide his influences and perhaps that's the point. But alas, 'Mama' never feels wholly original nor clever. It's a perfectly capable horror film that will provide just enough scares and intrigue for an audience, but it likely won't stay with you for more than a few days after viewing.6.4/10",6,0,0,25 May 2019
Super 8," Solid Sci-Fi Thriller
","Super 8 is one of those Spielberg films that he didn't direct, but yet you can easily see his imprint on it. J.J Abrams did a great job directing this mystery thriller with an unbelievably young cast. I was quite surprised at the talent of the core 5 actors who are filming a Super 8 movie and end up coming across an Alien like attack. Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning give believable performances but at times the romance did feel a little too cliché. Overall it's a thrilling experience that makes you remember some of the great Sci-Fi flicks of the past.With Abrams and Spielberg at the helm I would have thought there would be more star power at the core of this film. But I guess if you think about Close Encounters of the Third Kind, that had virtually all unknown actors at the time. I would have liked to see a little bit more of the actual monster/alien in the 2 hour running time. I did feel like the ending resolution to the Alien was a tad out of place. But I did like the story of Joe losing his mom and basically trying to get over her throughout the film. But at the same time I think in order for us all to feel the emotional impact they wanted us to feel.It was refreshing to see a blockbuster movie led by basically an all under 15 year old cast. You just don't get to see that in Hollywood these days. Even with some of its gory moments, I think this is a movie that can be enjoyed by an entire family. Now can Abrams get Spielberg to help him direct one of the new Star Wars films?

A Clockwork Orange," Ludwig Van...
","Are there any science fiction/futuristic films that don't have a cynical or dire viewpoint on the world and society as a whole? A Clockwork Orange is a cerebral look into a group of young males venture into ultraviolence and mass crime against the innocent. It's known for its deep themes and moralistic questions that it proposes. Oh, and it's pretty dark and haunting.Although 30 years apart, A Clockwork Orange reminds me a lot of Requiem for a Dream. Both films explore a group of troubled young adults who get their hands far too deep into something dangerous. For Requiem it was drugs, Clockwork it was violence. Both films also do a nice job at miraculously making criminals likable, or at least people who you can have sympathy for. Most of all, both films are thought provoking pieces of art, but something that I never want to re-watch.Clockwork particularly follows Alex DeLarge, a delinquent who takes a lot of joy out of committing crime. But his heinous crimes of rape and murder finally catch up to him and he's sent to jail, where an offer to rehabilitate and set him free catches his eye (pun intended). Before I get into the meat of what this film deals with, it's worth talking about Stanley Kubrick for a second. He's directed some of the most famous, and usually divisive, films of the 20th century. All visually stunning, thought provoking, and graphic in detail. A Clockwork Orange is all of those things, but there's no particular moment that I want to revisit, and perhaps that was Kubrick's intent. Perhaps, he wanted the audience to always feel uneasy and on the edge of their seat. Perhaps, Kubrick wanted us to go through a similar treatment to what Alex underwent. The Ludovico technique.Kubrick has a knack for producing imagery that will never leave your mind. Just as I'll never look at hotel rooms the same after The Shining, or A.I. after 2001, I don't think I'll ever be able to erase the image of Alex brutally raping and murdering a woman while singing 'Singin' in the Rain'. Shocking, disturbing, you name it. That was an extremely powerful scene. That pretty much goes for the whole film as well. Malcom McDowell provides an engrossing and charismatic turn as Alex. I'm sure it's incredibly difficult to make this character someone who you actually root against and then subsequently root for, but he does it. And that's not even mentioning the difficult physicality of this role.Overall, A Clockwork Orange is a film filled with deep and dark themes that will stick with you long after you see them. Great performances and great directing from Kubrick power the film through what should be purely exploitative, into something influential. +McDowell's impressive performance physically and emotionally+Thought provoking+Haunting imagery-Difficult to imagine myself ever revisiting it8.0/10",8,0,1,18 April 2017
The King," Peace Forged By Victory
","The King is getting compared to last year's 'The Outlaw King' quite a bit. Released on Netflix, period piece 'epic' war film, reluctant hero, etc. While certainly a fair comparison on the outskirts, I think The King deserves to be praised on its own merits, though both films are quite good. With a much slower burn, The King is a film largely about trying to fix the sins & mistakes of the previous reign/generation so that peace can be brought to the world, and it succeeds on almost every level at telling the story in that way. I was worried about Chalamet and Pattinson's accents, with only the latter feeling a tad off. But overall, this cast is magnificent, both leading men are surrounded by an incredibly talented character actor based group who know exactly what is needed of them to tell the story (or at least the beginning) of Henry V. Joel Edgerton absolutely steals this film from the get-go, and the final 15 minutes contain just enough surprises for the casual viewer. Loved this one.8.7/10",8,8,14,14 November 2019
Love & Mercy," Beautiful, Gripping, Eerie
","There have been plenty of great musician biopics over the years, but I can't remember there being two incredible ones in the same year. Straight Outta Compton and Love & Mercy are two very different films in terms of structure and story for that matter, but both are equally as gripping and satisfying. Focusing mostly solely on Brian Wilson, The Beach Boys leader, Love & Mercy tells the story of Brian in the early days of the band, and also his days in his 40's when his therapist controlled most of his life. The film's structure goes back and forth between these two eras with Paul Dano playing Wilson in his early days and John Cusack later on. Both of the performances exude a great amount of pain and suffering while still feeling relatable at the same time. Bill Pohlad also deserves a lot of credit for his ability to weave the two time periods together in seamless fashion.The music of The Beach Boys will suck you in from the start, but it's really the writing, direction, and performances that keep you watching. The eerie tone is not that of a mainstream film, but that's a good correlation to the not-so-mainstream 'Pet Sounds' album the group worked on for a majority of the early years scenes. The film also does a good job of portraying the crazy genius that Brian Wilson was. His ability to mix song structure and break the norm of music at that time and even stray away from where the group was is unparalleled and extremely risky.Paul Giamatti plays a similar back-stabbing character as he does in Straight Outta Compton, but it fits perfectly for his strengths. Really, there aren't any real weaknesses of this film. It's captivating throughout and the performances may even be worthy of some recognition come awards season. A job well done.+Both lead performances+Strange tone+Bill Pohlad's consistent direction+Who doesn't love the music?8.2/10",8,7,9,8 December 2015
Total Recall," The Man From Mars
","Much like a lot of Arnold Schwarzenegger's films, Total Recall is action packed, boasts great special effects, and one-liners. But this time, it's handled with intelligent ideas and thought provoking themes. Luckily, most of the time everything comes together nicely.Total Recall is based off a Phillip K. Dick short story, which is why it's no surprise this film tries to tackle a whole lot of interesting science fiction proposals. Even when the films themselves aren't always the best, I've always found Dick's ideas to be fascinating. Total Recall is about a man caught up in a mysterious sequence of events that may just alter his life on earth for good, or should I say his life on Mars. It takes place in 2084 where it's possible to take a 'virtual vacation' to wherever you want. Naturally, a lot of people choose other planets, including the habitable planet of Mars. Douglas Quaid, played by Schwarzenegger, decided to take on the mission to gain his life back.However, it becomes increasingly clear that his life that he thought he had, is no longer in reach. Being that it's an action film, Quaid is pretty much on the run the rest of the movie, and chaos inevitably ensues. Schwarzenegger is great at all the action, and handles enough of the heavy and heady material to get by. I think where this film doesn't always succeed is when it tries to bite off more than it can chew. Whether it be because of the directing, writing, or acting, Total Recall becomes swallowed in twists and turns that don't always work in the context of the film they set up.I know there are endless amounts of theories about whether Quaid is dreaming or not. And while it's an interesting question that the film proposes, this isn't necessarily what I'm referring to. The third act is about twist after twist that feels more desperate than it does natural. Take Inception for example, that film deals with similar themes, but it does so by revealing things one by one, instead of depending on how shocked the audience can get. There's a big difference between twists and reveals.Overall, Total Recall is definitely one of the better sci-fi's that attempts to balance a light-hearted tone with heavy themes. It just sometimes gets caught up in being too bold instead of staying bright.+Phillip K. Dick's ideas+Fun & thought provoking-But sometimes those themes collapse on themselves.7.6/10",7,0,3,1 May 2017

Don't Breathe is meticulously well-paced and directed, as Fede Alvarez gives us the best horror flick of 2016.I'm not a horror guy nor will I probably ever be. The genre never seems to stay good enough to grip me from film to film. But films like Don't Breathe do their best to turn my feelings around. Take for example the 'jump scare', something horror films tend to do provide a few too many of, is perfectly used in this film. I never felt that Alvarez was manipulating his audience into feeling scared in situations they didn't need to be. That's essentially what those 'jump scares' do, they make audiences scared because the story itself can't. It's lazy filmmaking. But when we do jump out of our seats in Don't Breathe, it feels earned. The premise consists of a few low-life young adults who make their living on robbing houses and find themselves trapped inside the house of one of their 'supposedly helpless' victims. Their target was that of a blind man and Army veteran, played by Stephen Lang, living in a mostly abandoned Detroit neighborhood. I haven't seen a ton of horror, but this just seems like the perfect idea for a horror film. Plus, anything with Stephen Lang as the antagonist is worth watching. Not only can he pull off the physically intimidating side, but he also able to make it believable that he was blind.And really, without much dialogue at all, all of the actors deserve a ton of credit. Jane Levy, who I never heard of, was a revelation. Both with what her character goes through physically and the emotional levels she was able to reach, I was greatly impressed. Even Dylan Minnette, who I wasn't a fan of in Goosebumps, did a fine job as a nice complement to Levy.The actors were of course helped by Alvarez' unique vision and style of filmmaking showcased here. Minimal and timely use of lighting were a solid choice to set the mood, while long takes and close ups were also well oriented. I also have to give a shout-out to the sound department and the composer, Roque Banos. Sound is usually half of what makes a horror film, and Don't breathe doesn't disappoint in that area. Banos hits the right notes in all of the moments and the use of 'breathing' as a sound effect was extremely effective.Without going into too much detail, I don't know how much more I can praise this film. It's truly a masterful directing job by Fede Alvarez with a star-making performance from Jane Levy and the great Stephen Lang.94/100",9,6,11,5 September 2016
Beauty and the Beast," That Was Magical
","Out of all the Disney live action remakes in the works, perhaps none more sacred to film fans than Beauty and the Beast. Dissecting and critiquing every set photo, clip, and trailer to pieces, there was a ton of pressure on Bill Condon's remake. With that said, it's hard to imagine a more fitting re-imagining of the classic tale than the one we were given.Let's talk about this cast. This may be the most perfectly cast film I've seen in quite some time. Starting with Emma Watson as the beloved princess, Belle. Lily James certainly had some pressure taking on Cinderella, but to today's audience, Belle is the more popular character. Watson wasn't going to please everyone, but she captures Belle's wonder, intelligence, curiosity, passion, and of course, beauty. Pair her with a great performance by Dan Stevens as the co-lead, and you have your classic romance.Luke Evans as Gaston, Josh Gad as LeFou, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellan as Cogsworth, and Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts? Come on now, casting that impeccably just isn't normal. They don't just look like their animated counterparts from the 1991 version, they completely embody every aspect of what made us love them in the first place. McGregor and McKellan have a hilarious back and forth, as do Gad and Evans, and Kline & Thompson will break your heart as respected parents.As for the music, which probably provided the most hesitation from avid fans. Would they change things too much? Too little? Would the new songs actually add anything of value? I wasn't bothered by any of the new music, but none of them particularly stood out either. But they nailed all of the new renditions of the classic Alan Menken hits. I don't know that anyone can top Angela Lansbury's Beauty and the Beast/Tale as Old as Time, but Emma Thompson gives it her best effort. The 'Be Our Guest' scene? Yep, it's just as ridiculously fun as the original.The additional time spent fleshing out the Beast and Belle's individual backstories felt necessary and not excessive. Really, the only thing that needed working on in this movie was Beast's CGI. There were moments of really noticeable effects work, especially in the ballroom dance sequence. Unfortunately, that's one of the most important scenes in the film, you'd think that would be something they spent a little more time on. In the same vein, not all of the green screen was polished either. I love how colorful and wondrous the production design and sets are, but that can only do so much. But if the CGI is all I'm complaining about, then I think the filmmakers did alright.I watched the 1991 version a lot as a kid, so this was a remake that was near and dear to my heart and pretty much my entire generation. With the exception of a few CGI filled scenes, I think this ranks up there with the best of Disney Live Action remakes. It's not often I get swept up with emotion at the climax of a kids movie, but I just couldn't help myself with this one. The cinematography, the performances, and that legendary music all came together at the end. This was nothing short of a magical time at the theaters.+Perfect cast+Glorious music+Felt the Disney magic once again+Subtle additions were beneficial-Beast CGI was worse than I originally thought9.3/10",9,6,16,19 March 2017
Sicario," Land of Wolves
","After Prisoners and Enemy in back to back years, two of the more thought provoking films of the past few years, I have been awaiting Denis Villeneuve's next project. Of course, Emily Blunt is my favorite actress right now, so in my mind the two of them were enough to get Sicario on my most anticipated list for 2015. I can assure you, the film doesn't letdown. Sicario is about an FBI agent, played by Blunt, who is brought along by a government task force to help on the border of Mexico and the U.S. as drug cartels rule the area.One of the most chilling parts about Sicario is its realistic nature. I had a Zero Dark Thirty vibe in that it doesn't hold back in its brutality. They both have a brilliant female lead as well, although much different characters by motive. Blunt is complemented by Benicio Del Toro and Josh Brolin as the main three agents. Part of the greatness of Sicario is its cast but I think the marketing was a bit misleading. We are led to believe that Blunt is the central focus of the story, but there is almost as much if not more of Del Toro than anyone else here. It's both good and bad. I was looking forward to seeing Blunt as the integral part of the story, but Del Toro was just as good. I think the real star of the film is Roger Deakins, the director of photography. He once again gives an incredibly beautiful looking film through his award winning cinematography. Even though this film may fail to get any acting nominations or any of the other big awards, I think it's safe to say that Deakins is a lock for cinematography. It's his panning shots of the border along with J贸hann J贸hannsson's score that give the film an eerie and ominous feel. It's very difficult to talk about any details without spoiling anything, but I can say that it's a really good movie. I was reading a review that talked about the intensity of a scene before the intensity really begins, if that makes sense. It wasn't the gunshots or explosions that gave me chills. It was the quiet calm scenes before the storm. It's not the mind bender that Enemy was nor the shocker that was Prisoners, but Sicario is one of the most beautifully shot and well acted films this year.+Blunt can do no wrong+Eerie score+Deakins' cinematography+Brutally real+Very very very intense9.0/10",9,1,6,4 October 2015
Jack Reacher," Life or Death
","Tom Cruise may very well be the one man left in Hollywood who commands the top spot in the box office opening weekend. Unfortunately, Jack Reacher didn't reach that feat, nor did it probably deserve to. But it's far from a weak spot in Cruise' long history of brilliant action fun.Jack Reacher stars several Oscar caliber actors including Cruise, Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins, David Oyelowo, Robert Duvall, and Werner Herzog. All of which provide fine performances. But if we are being honest, Cruise is having by far the most fun here. Reacher is a slightly more brutal and definitely cockier version of his now classic, Ethan Hunt character from M:I. Now over 50-years old, I'm glad he still loves delivering those cheesy punch lines as much as he is doing insane stunts.The film itself definitely takes itself a little bit more serious, however, which is where it runs into a few problems. Although I think Christopher McQuarrie's directorial effort for M:I 5 was impeccable, he has trouble balancing the tone and pace of this particular film. At times, it claims itself to be a serious and even tragic espionage thriller. But the final 30 minutes completely forget about the grounded tone and let Cruise loose on one of his bone-crushing Mission Impossible action sprees. I just would have liked a bit more of a happy medium between the two.With that said, the brilliance of the film lies within all of its espionage and mysterious elements. Way before Cruise throws a single punch or shoots any bullets, I was sucked into the mystery the opening presents. The opening segment, along with two other extended sequences, are impressively done with absolutely no dialogue, yet you understand exactly what's going on. McQuarrie's directing talent really shines there.Much of the rest of the film's fun comes from some expectedly great supporting performances from Duvall and Herzog. Both have minimal screen time but they nonetheless steal every scene they are in. There's without question fun to be had with their roles and the film itself, but I can't help but think some more time in the writer's room could have helped polish the film a little. There weren't any particular moments in the film I disliked, but the cohesiveness just wasn't present.+Cruise at his best+Fun supporting performances+Eerie tone in the first half-Too action heavy towards the end-Tonal issues7.6/10",7,0,0,8 July 2016
"McFarland, USA"," Fast Times at McFarland High
","A job of a film based on a true story is not to tell everything exactly how it is, in fact, much of McFarland USA is fibbed to a certain extent. But to me, that's perfectly fine. McFarland, USA is a very entertaining movie even with its historical inaccuracies. Disney consistently puts out these under the radar sports films. Plus, you can't really go wrong with Kevin Costner starring in a sports film anyway.It tells the story of a underdog Latino cross country team from McFarland, California coached by a white male coincidentally named James White. You get pretty much every cliché in the books in terms of sports films. The family issues of too much commitment to the sport, trust issues with their coach, and the dramatic left turn in the 3rd act. But clichéd films can still be good if handled correctly, and McFarland, USA most definitely was. I was surprised by the acting from pretty much unknown actors across the board, aside from Costner and Maria Bello. There's also a good amount of culture blending between White's family and the Latino families that predominately populated the city. Although most of the family issues that were going on seemed more like plot devices than anything else, I enjoyed watching the families come together for a Quinceañera and to cheer on their McFarland team.The film tries and tackle a different issue with each of the teams members and while most of them work dramatically on their own, it didn't seem like it tonally fit in with the rest of the picture. But I can't peak highly enough on how much I dug Costner's speeches throughout the film. I've seen many sports films with a ton of great speeches, but these hang up there with the great ones.I'm not sure how much of the behind the scenes issues with the coach being recruited were factual, but I can say that I don't think they were really necessary. I think the ending has enough gravitas to hold its own without having that hang over the fate of the team. I'm also not too sure on why the subtle romance was necessary as it felt really awkward throughout. The movie has an emotionally satisfying ending that I think I can forgive some of its mistakes.+Costner's performance & speeches+Family aspect+Emotionally satisfying+Music-Awkward romance-Few far-fetched moments and clichés7.1/10",7,1,3,20 September 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy: Ego Strikes Back
","If there's one thing you can always count on with Marvel Studios, it's the humor. That is, that there will always be tons of it, in whichever project, and however serious they are, there will always be plenty of humor. With some films that doesn't work out so well (I'm looking at you Doctor Strange). With other films it fits in nicely, like Guardians of the Galaxy. It's that humor above all else that keeps Volume 2 afloat.However, even a series as funny as Guardians can have its bumps and bruises, that includes some mistimed jokes. But I think what hurt this sequel was the uneven pacing. Volume 2 took the Empire Strikes Back approach by spacing out the team for most of the film. This approach proved to be both good and bad for the film. On one hand, it gives us fresh dynamics like with Rocket, (Baby) Groot & Yondu. Or Drax & Mantis. Or Gamora & Peter/Gamora & Nebula. It all plays out as nice character depth for all of them as the group dives deeper into the (Fast and Furious style) fact that they are all the only family each other has. With that said, spreading out the characters really slows down the pacing. In fact, you don't even really know what the films actually leading to until there's only 25 or 30 minutes left in the movie. Basically, we meet Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russel, who is also Peter Quill's father. Surprise surprise, Ego turns out to be hiding a whole lot more than expected and Peter and the Guardians are forced to take him down. But this all doesn't happen until very late in the game. So much so that the third act feels so incredibly unbalanced since the first hour of the movie doesn't seem to be leading towards this at all.Luckily, there's a lot about Volume 2 that I was thrilled about. First and foremost, this is the best looking Marvel film to date, without a doubt, bar none. It's the first film to be shot with an 8k resolution camera, called the Red Weapon 8k. Every single shot in this film is oozing with gorgeousness, which is one of the reasons I would like to see the film again. Being that it's one of the few Marvel space opera's, it probably has the most difficult time looking as good as it does. Everything in the background and foreground is fake. Heck, even Groot and Rocket are fake. But you wouldn't know it by looking at it. Perhaps they built some sets, but they couldn't possibly build everything, and it all looks so dang real.Also, as I previously mentioned, the humor is on point 90 percent of the time. This is probably where James Gunn's brilliance comes in the most, his ability to perfectly time the humor in with the action. It's also pleasing that it's not only spoken humor, there's plenty of physical humor as well. Drax particularly stands out in this regard, as does Mantis, Rocket, and of course Baby Groot. I can complain over and over about some of the pacing issues and how the overall dramatic beats of the film didn't necessarily work for me, but the film is a blast from beginning to end, there's no denying that. But I think it needed a little bit more balance between the drama and comedy if it wanted to pull off some of the third act feats that it tried to, and I think this film could have used a little bit more time with the team together rather than separate.A few last-minute tidbits to comment on: I could care less about Nebula and Gamora's relationship. There's something about it that just doesn't resonate with me. I have to believe Sylvester Stallone's role will expand in Vol.3 because he got absolutely nothing to do. And lastly, the 5 post credit scenes were probably unnecessary, especially if none of them tied into Infinity War.+The best-looking Marvel film to date+I love Drax+They didn't exploit Baby Groot as much as I expected+Plenty of great humor-But the dramatic moments don't always hit-Serious pacing issues-Spreading the team out hurt the film7.6/10",7,1,5,4 May 2017
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," What a Brilliantly Fun Way to Begin a Monumental Franchise
","If for nothing else, the Harry Potter films always find a way to give me a great sense of nostalgia. I, like many others, grew up with this franchise. In many ways, this was our generation's Star Wars. It was the 2000's pop culture phenomena. I'm happy to say that the first film, The Sorcerer's Stone, still undoubtedly holds up.I feel like I should first mention just how impressive it is that Warner Bros and their casting directors found the perfect Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Yes, the rest of the film is also impeccably casted with Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, and Tom Felton just to mention a few, but it's the core three characters that carry this franchise. Watching the three of them play off each other so effectively at such a young age is truly awe-inspiring.Granted, heroes are only as good as their villains, and luckily they have a great one in Lord Voldemort. Even though in Sorcerer's Stone it's hard to really call him in the big-bad, considering he's not resurrected yet, but his presence is definitely felt. With that said, I wish they would have involved Professor Quirrell more in the main plot. He's a sketchy guy, but you never get a real sense that he's working to resurrect Voldemort. In fact, he's barely in the movie, so his presence towards the end is unexpected, but I didn't feel like it was earned.But the mishandling of the villain doesn't diminish the tremendous amount of fun The Sorcerer's Stone brings to the young franchise. Chris Columbus does a nice job of setting up all the relationships and characters we will come to love later like Hagrid, Dumbledore, and even Snape. This is clearly focused on the trio, but they each get a chance to chew up some scenery with the young wizards. Everything from a clumsy giant, the dark forest, a game of quidditch, to an important game of chess make The Sorcerer's Stone one of the most memorable entries into the Potter franchise. +The trio are effortlessly cute and entertaining+Pacing+All the beloved characters sprinkled in+Balances a bunch of genres in one-Villain reveal is iffy8.4/10",8,2,3,26 October 2016
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," A Turning Point for the Legendary Franchise
","Up until Goblet of Fire, the Potter franchise is a load of fun with some creepy imagery and dark concepts mixed in. But Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise for me. Yes, Prisoner of Azkaban has its dark moments, but the grave sense of danger and threat isn't really present until the 4th film.The Goblet of Fire opens with a pretty terrifying dream sequence involving a deformed Voldemort, which may very well be my favorite opening to any of the films in the series. It comes right out and states that this franchise is no longer just a fun adventure, there are dangerously high stakes involved here, and Voldemort is a part of them. Of course, part of the fun nature of this film is its mysteriousness and the unpredictability. I've seen the film several times, but there's nothing quite like watching the Triwizard Tournament with someone who has no idea what they're in for.Goblet certainly brings some new characters along with its different identity. Most notably, Brendan Gleeson's Professor Alastor 'Mad¬Eye' Moody. Looking back, it's difficult to assess how much I enjoyed the character considering he was kidnapped for nearly the entire length of the film, but his impact on Harry's tribulations throughout the film are felt. I mean, why wouldn't he be an interesting character? He's just the 4th straight new defense against the dark arts teacher to be hiding something in one way or another.No matter, The Goblet of Fire is full of fresh adventures for the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Most of the film involves Harry competing in the various events of the tournament (which ends up feeling a whole lot like a Hunger Games), but there's always time for some quality trio scenes. Weirdly enough, this film made those scenes mostly deal with romance at the Yule Ball involving the three schools. It's admittedly the next logical step in these teenagers lives, but sometimes it can be a bit overboard. Some of it plays for comedy, but did I really need to see EVERYONE at Hogwarts, and I mean everyone, share the dance floor or have a scene with a love interest.In many ways, The Goblet of Fire is the turning point in the franchise, and the first time you see someone of importance get hurt in a grave way. Although you don't have a ton of time for Cedric to develop, his death altered the course of the series and the mindsets of those at Hogwarts. That in itself makes it an important installment in the series. Not to mention the fact that there's a dragon, a bada** maze, and one unsettling resurrection towards the end. This is one of the better films, by a good margin.+Moody's introduction+Voldemort officially returns+More mature and powerfully written than previous entries+Turning point in the franchise-Too much romance9.2/10",9,1,2,9 November 2016
The Shape of Water," Life is But the Shipwreck of Our Plans
","Whether it be Creature from the Black Lagoon, Beauty and the Beast, Edward Scissorhands, or even Her from a few years ago, movies about forbidden love are a common theme in romantic films. And if done right, they could be extremely effective. The Shape of Water stands as a fresh take on that tale, and yes it works really well as a romance between a government controlled creature and a mute custodian.Driven by emotional performances, The Shape of Water feels simple in premise considering we have seen similar stories (mentioned above) almost every year. But it all comes down to execution. Director Guillermo del Toro frames this story as a good guy-bad guy situation, but certainly rounds out each character with emotions and just enough depth to care about every scenario.In that way, the original screenplay by GDT and Vanessa Taylor could be among the best written this year. Every scene has importance and the 2 hour runtime is perfectly paced. There are also several actors who turn in Oscar caliber performances including lead Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Octavia Spencer, Richard Jenkins, and Michael Stuhlbarg. I would have to go through the other films and put together a list of Oscar predictions, but all actors mentioned above have a chance at a nominations.GDT has a knack for making gorgeous looking films and The Shape of Water is no different. Everything from the creature played by Doug Jones to the production design and cinematography, this is easily one of the best looking films of the year. To that note, I don't really have a complaint with the film. Performances, writing, directing, visuals, and romance are all way above par. These uniquely executed films are always something I will cherish, and I'm glad GDT was able to bring this to screens, especially before the Fox-Disney merger. It really makes you wonder if we will even get these types of movies once that deal goes down. One can only hope.9.0/10",9,62,128,19 December 2017
The Disaster Artist," As Entertaining as it is Endearing
","The best filmmakers are the ones who put their heart and soul into something they had a specific vision for and see it out until its release. Albeit a strange and unclear vision, Tommy Wiseau certainly envisioned something for The Room. Whether or not he knew all along that it would be interpreted at a comedy (there's no way), who knows. But there will always be room for people in Hollywood who put everything into making a film. The Disaster Artist does its best to exemplify the balance between a chaotic mess of making a movie to the heart and devotion of someone trying to make their dreams come true.The Disaster Artist takes a mostly comedic approach to the source material, but it does have plenty of heartfelt moments, thanks to the chemistry of the Franco brothers as Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sistero, two men devoted to making their own Hollywood movie since the city continues to 'disrespect' and 'misunderstand' their talents. I'm always on board to watch a movie where people pursue their dreams, especially those trying to make it in Hollywood. Throw in the fact that Wiseau remains a mystery in real life, as does the production behind The Room, and you have yourself a movie worth making.Something The Room clearly didn't do is establish a specific tone to ensure everything runs cohesively throughout the movie. Where scenes constantly come and go with no real reason or explanation in The Room, The Disaster Artist makes good use of its runtime to make a quick and memorable bio-drama that is equally as entertaining as it is endearing. I initially walked away from watching The Room with confusion and misplaced laughter, I came out of The Disaster Artist even more fascinated with Wiseau's history and the troubled production of The Room.So although Wiseau never could have imagined there would be a movie made about his trainwreck of a film, I can't help but feel happy that Wiseau eventually got to this position, and in a way, fulfilled his dreams. 9.0/10",9,0,2,10 December 2017
A Beautiful Mind," Something Extraordinary
","Ron Howard is always great at adapting true stories into well- structured biopics. Whether it be Rush, Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, or A Beautiful Mind, he has a knack for representing real people well while also adding some movie magic in there as well.The first time I watched A Beautiful Mind I was blown away by it. Not only did I think all of the actors did a tremendous job sinking their teeth into each role, but I couldn't believe how fascinating John Nash's life was. This is a man was a student at Princeton and made significant contributions to the world of mathematics and economics (including proposing several theories and equations), all while being diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.Russell Crowe gives one of his best performances as John Nash, in what also may be his most challenging. Crowe has to make it believable that he's both one of the brightest minds in the world but also someone who is seriously struggling with mental illness. He has great chemistry with his love interest, Alicia Nash, played by Jennifer Connelly. In fact, I think this film is a better romance than it is a biopic. Connelly, who won an Oscar for playing Alicia, is a revelation here. She had impressed in previous films, but there's something about her balancing the sweetness of Alicia's personality with her turmoil filled personal life.I think the main issue with A Beautiful Mind is its pace. At 138 minutes, it's right about at the length of your usual bio-drama, but it doesn't feel like it. The film moves at a really slow pace, especially before we realize what Nash is going through mentally. Part of the reason for this is that I found it hard to approach the complexities of his work. The story is interesting, but I can't say I knew exactly what was going on half the time. If the film would have found a way to make all the equations and theories dumbed down for the general audience, the film would have felt much smoother.Overall, the film is well done. I love James Horner's score, Roger Deakin's cinematography is beautiful, as is the romance between Connelly and Crowe, but I think it lacks in re-watchability and pacing.+Romance+Score+Strong performances+Extraordinary story-But difficult to follow at times8.5/10",8,0,0,16 April 2017
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Nostalgia
","I love Chamber of Secrets. To me, it's the last Potter film to make me feel nostalgic towards the series. Don't get me wrong, I love all 8 films, but there's something about the campy and all around goofiness to Chamber of Secrets that makes it all the more endearing.Even though it was filmed merely months after the first film was released; Harry, Ron, and Hermione feel like they have grown so much since their first outing at Hogwarts. I guess that's the feeling you get when you watch the films within days of each other. With that said, we are jumped right back into the fold as Harry is back with his muggle family in England when a house elf, named Dobby, appears and warns him to never return back to Hogwarts. Being that it's the confident and curious Harry Potter we're talking about, of course he makes his way back to the school within a few scenes.Much like the first film, we have plenty of entertaining side missions for the trio to go on which included; a flying car, taking a potion to disguise themselves as Slytherin, following spiders into the dark forest, and of course some Quidditch. All of this makes for a brisk 2 hours and 40 minutes of wizard fun. But the film isn't short on its eerie reveals, adventurous thrills, and dark storytelling.Chamber of Secrets brilliantly balances all of that though. Seeing Harry venture into the secrets of Tom Riddle's diary is some terrifying stuff to see as a kid, as is seeing various victims picked off in Hogwarts due to the Chamber being open. And to me, it holds up to this day. There's definitely a more childish tone to it all, but these are 12-year-olds after all.This film was also a test for Harry, and particularly Daniel Radcliffe, to show if he can truly carry a film or not. Hermione is sidelined for the last 40 minutes or so and Ron is just about scared of anything they come across. If there was ever a question to that proposal, Chamber of Secrets definitely put that to rest. The first film is great, but this was Harry and Radcliffe coming into their own as character and actor respectively. From here on out it's a much darker and relentlessly thrilling take on the character, so I'll always be partial to the lighter tone Chamber of Secrets presented.+Balances goofy and gripping scenes well+Chamber fight+Unsettling reveals+Plenty of entertaining missions for the trio9.0/10",9,0,1,31 October 2016
American Made," Infectious
","The one thing I always ask of biopics is entertainment. You don't have to make a completely faithful adaption of true events, we have Wikipedia for that. All I ask is for a film to provide entertainment while maintaining the spirit of the true events. I'm not entirely sure how close American Made stayed to the life of Barry Seal, but it's damn well one of the most entertaining films of the year. With a refreshingly great performance from Tom Cruise and a pace that rivals the best of Scorsese's based-on-true-story films, American Made is another gem collaboration from star Cruise and director Doug Liman.American Made centers around the life of Barry Seal, a pilot who gets hired by the CIA to ship weapons to Central America and also gets caught up with drug cartels during his trips. The best way to describe this film is wild. But I think what I appreciated the most about it was it never felt like Liman was glorifying this irreverent lifestyle. Unlike say, Wolf of Wall Street, American Made never explicitly shows drug use, overtly sexualized scenes, or extreme violence. Instead, you get the full effect by just watching Seal go through ridiculous experience after ridiculous experience, and the smile never leaves Cruise's face.You can tell Cruise is having a blast making this, and his performance certainly echoes that. I mean, it doesn't hurt that I still had the taste of that Mummy movie before watching American Made. Luckily, Cruise is surrounded by a talented cast who follow along with the energetic tone Liman brings. And the energy this movie brings is second to none this year. I absolutely loved the way Liman told this story, never allowing the political side of this story to get in the way of a fast-paced drama. This isn't Goodfellas, Casino, or even Wolf of Wall Street, but American Made is a fascinating story that needed to be told and I'm glad Liman and Cruise were the ones who got the chance to tell it. Perfectly paced and infectiously performed, American Made is one of the best films of the year.8.8/10",8,1,3,1 October 2017
The Witch," Dark, Twisted, and Haunting Imagery
","When you leave the theater in stunned silence, I think the film did its job. The Witch is the next low budget horror film to reach the theaters this year, and it's easily the best. The film rarely ever relies on jump scares to get your head spinning as the core of this film's brilliance lies with its haunting imagery and eerie score. It's hard for an audience of this day and age to get into a period piece set in the 17th century without any big name actors or action elements. And I have to admit that I wasn't sure I wanted to see a film like this, especially with its horror elements. But my eyes were pealed from beginning to end. I wouldn't say anything about the story shocked me or had me confused, but the imagery, score, and uncompromising nature to Robert Egger's direction left me breathless. Within 10 minutes I was looking at the screen and whispering to myself 'why would you go there?', 'Don't do that!', or 'come on, really?'. Not because I thought it was poor story- telling, but because I was so invested as to what these characters were doing.With that said, I don't think this film is for everyone. It's brutal, harshly relentless, and utterly disturbing. The characters use all 17th century dialogue and the cinematography sets this grey and ominous tone. The imagery from beginning to end will stick in your head as it has done with me. But that's the way horror films should be. I wouldn't say it's more a psychological thriller because there are plenty of terrifying moments, but it is more for the 'Under the Skin' crowd than it is for people who love 'The Conjuring'. Even in its harsh moments, I was always invested and I can't deny the quality of the writing, directing, and acting all around.

When Harry Met Sally...," one of the best rom-com-drams
","I think what makes this movie so special is that everyone can relate to this story. It tells that classic story of long time friends who cant seem to accept each other with other people but don't have the guts to make a move on each other. You can tell from the first scene that Harry and Sally both feel some romantic tension between them. Obviously at first they each want different things with a partner. This is shown by their disagreement with the end of Casablanca. I thought that was a clever way of setting up the ending. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan have great chemistry throughout. Which is especially impressive because of how many different meetings they have together. Whats a good romance without a few tear jerker moments? Well this movie definitely has a few, as it most likely one of the top love stories in cinematic history.I really liked that they had their friends set up, and then ended up helping get them married. To me that shows the hope for Harry and Sally in the second half of the movie. For some reason Harry and Sally cant accept being together, even though in the first scene Harry states that men and women can never be friends. Rob Reiner directs each character with flaws so that we aren't finding ourselves only rooting for one side. They try to date other people but you can tell that each time, tension rises and all result in break ups.I think my only complaint for the movie would be that it seems like in movies when a fallout in a relationship happens, its always the man who gives in and ends up trying to resolve the situation. They portray the women to be the stubborn ones and wait until the man calls her. Even if thats what happens I would like to see a refreshing take on that. But in a romantic movie you want the ending to be emotionally moving, and this one delivers. Their final scene together is heartwarming and overall pleasing. You really feel you went on this ride with this couple for a few hours so when you get an ending that hits, its extra satisfying. +Billy Crystals rants on relationships+relatable for everyone+an ending that actually delivers-vague male stereotypes9.3/10",9,0,1,20 May 2014
Steve Jobs," Think Different
","There's something to be said for a film without special effects, big set pieces, or action scenes, and still is captivating from beginning to end. Steve Jobs is one of the most important figures in our generation, if not the most. While I'm typing this review there's a commercial for the new IPhone 6S, the man's imprint is everywhere at all times. But to me he's always been a bit of a mystery. Everything from his relationship with his supposed daughter to the broken friendship and partnership between him and Wozniak has fascinated me. Although this film may not tell the whole story, it tells one hell of one. With the best screenplay of 2015 and tremendous performances all around, Steve Jobs is one of the best films of the year. With an incredible end product, it's hard to remember all the troubles this film had behind the scenes. With the shuffling of directors, lead actors, and even studios, for awhile it seemed unlikely this film was ever going to get made. Foe what it's worth, I would have loved to see what Christian Bale would have done with Jobs, but Fassbender proved to be a strong choice. He doesn't look much like Jobs at all, but he seemed to capture his mannerisms and his presence for this rendition of jobs. Credit should also be given to the terrific ensemble cast. Kate Winslet held the film together as much as her character did her Jobs himself. Seth Rogen, who wouldn't normally associate himself with dramatic roles, gives a Jonah Hill in Moneyball like performance. I don't know if it will get him an Oscar nomination, but I think he may deserve one. Someone who may actually get one is Jeff Daniels, who plays John Sculley. Both him and Rogen have demanding roles and scenes several times throughout the film, and they always rise to the occasion.But I think the hero of this film is the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin. The film is set up as 3 acts each right before an unveiling of one of Jobs' products. It's a structure that hasn't really been done before, but also proves to be very effective. It's jarring and even understandably annoying the first time they go to black as Jobs walks out on stage, but the material behind the stage is so interesting that you get used to it. The run-time is a brisk 120 minutes, but I could have watched 150 if they would have shown the presentations. Though we don't get a look into his products on the stage, we have YouTube for that, we do get a new understanding of the man behind the products and it couldn't have been more fascinating. It's worth mentioning Danny Boyle's great work behind the camera as well, although I'm having a hard time dividing the credit between him and the brilliant screenplay of Sorkin. For nothing else, this film should be seen because of its sharp and intelligent dialogue and Oscar worthy performances.+Fassbender brings it+And so does everyone else in the cast+Give Sorkin the Oscar now+Boyle handles the structure well-Cut off some intriguing moments9.3/10",9,3,6,25 October 2015
Crazy Heart," What Have You Done For Me Lately?
","Whether it be The Wrestler or even last year's Birdman, it seems we get a story of a middle aged man nearing the end of what was a great career in something, and is forced to try and put his life together both in and outside of his career. Crazy Heart is right up there with the aforementioned films. Focusing on Bad Blake, a country singer playing in bars and other low paying places after pissing his money away on booze and cigarettes. Played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges, who gives the character just the amount of sympathy needed without it feeling overdone. But the real noteworthy performance here is Maggie Gyllenhaal.A lot of people don't like Gyllenhaal, although I'm not sure why. She may have been a little bit annoying in The Dark Knight, but look at her performances in Donnie Darko, Crazy Heart, and most recently Frank, and tell me she isn't a proved Oscar caliber actress. She is magic when on screen with Bridges. Their relationship is fast moving, and although you don't really get a sense as to why they are so attracted to each other, it really works. This is not only an alcoholic man, but also one that doesn't shy away from his fair share of one-night-stands. So why is Gyllenhaal so different? Well perhaps because she has a son, buddy, who to Blake, is the son that he never had. Rather, the son he chose not to take care of all these years.Rounding out the main cast is Colin Farrell and Robert Duvall who do a great job in their very minor roles. But the core of the story is right there in Bad's relationship with Jean. She is the one person who just may change his bad ways, no pun intended. The film has a very heartwarming feeling throughout even in its darkest moments. I also give the film credit for getting a country music hater, like myself, to really enjoy the movie. It won't change the fact that I still believe all country songs sound the same, but I can appreciate a good film about music. So with Gyllenhaal's emotionally powerful performance and Bridges' equally as impressive portrayal of Bad, Crazy Heart is an acting led picture that succeeds on most of what it sets out to do.+Gyllenhaal's Oscar caliber performance+Bridges is always good+I don't even like country but I like this film+A lot of depth to these characters-So why are they drawn to each other?8.2/10",8,1,1,14 September 2015
War of the Worlds," Solid Alien Invasion For the Most Part
","When one of the greatest filmmakers in history makes a science fiction film, which is one of his biggest strengths, you have no choice but to check it out.War of the Worlds is loosely based on the H.G. Wells novel of the same name, about a father and his children trying to cope with a global alien invasion. There have been so many of these alien invasion films over the years, so it's difficult for any of them to feel fresh and stick out to me. I think the one thing that separates this film from others is that Tom Cruise or any of the other actors aren't playing characters that fight the aliens, or 'tripods' as they call them. It only makes up a matter of a few days following the first attack and the immediate aftermath.Because of that, Cruise is given more to do dramatically than per usual. He gets a few stunts and an action scene or two (because why wouldn't you take advantage of his talent) but it's much more about family than it is about anything else. In that regard, the film works most of the time. Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, father to both Rachel and Robbie. Not to intentionally quote another Cruise movie, but it's really (k)night and day with these kids. Dakota Fanning is perfectly cast as Rachel, a pre-teen who is terrified of the apocalyptic world she now lives in. However, I just couldn't get behind Justin Chatwin's performance and the character of Robbie. There were too many times in which I either felt the character was entirely unnecessary to the plot, or he kept the plot from moving forward in frustrating ways. Why does he all of a sudden feel the need to leave his family and join the Army's fight against the tripods? Makes no sense whatsoever.Unsurprisingly, Spielberg's visual flare is probably the film's biggest asset. Whether it's the endless amount of long takes, explosive and visceral alien action, or the impressive CGI and green screen work, War of the Worlds is a gorgeous film to look at. If every aspect of the film was as good as the visuals, this could have been quite the adaptation. Bottom line, I like everything visually and some of the performances very much, but the last 20 minutes is a bit of a letdown, as is the constant annoyance of the Robbie character.+Visuals+Dakota is magnificent-Annoying older brother7.7/10",7,0,1,3 May 2017
Mudbound," A Timeless Moment in Time
","The most disheartening thing about watching films revolve around slavery during the Civil War is that ultimately racism and discrimination didn't end when that war was over. In fact, they are still very prominent subjects in today's world. Which is why Mudbound works very well as a World War II period piece in the south. The same sort of racism and vastly unfair treatment people of color received back during slavery times happened during the civil rights era and are pretty much happening again now. All within varying degrees of severity, but still very much an issue in the public eye. The point being that Mudbound is a depressingly timeless story about two soldiers (one white, one black) coming home from World War II and not getting the best of welcomes from the townsmen and their opposing families.Mudbound is one of those films that doesn't necessarily push the boundaries of historical fiction or even films based around inequality. However, it does provide an intriguing story about two people who form an unlikely bond, which is tested when racism floods their world in Mississippi. When the characters are written well, the direction is on point, and the performances are impeccably good, some of the minor issues can be swept under the rug.Those performances include turns from Jason Clarke, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Mary J. Blige, Rob Morgan, and Jonathan Banks. All of which are equally effective. I've always believed the best compliment you can give an actor is that they blend so much into their characters that you think you're watching a documentary where the people don't know they are being filmed. It almost felt like these were particular moments in these families lives and I was just there to witness things unfold. And to that point, I'm sure that a story this dark and this haunting happened, especially when you consider how secluded the families are to the rest of civilization being on a farm. Overall, Mudbound is a gritty, devastating, and most of all important film that is sure to be up for some awards this winter.8.4/10",8,1,4,4 December 2017
Sausage Party," Grotesque, Even for Rogen Fans, but It's Endlessly Entertaining
","As entertaining as it is to watch food be voiced by Seth Rogen's squad, Sausage Party becomes increasingly grotesque and uncomfortable with every scene. Though I will say the ending may be one of 2016's greatest treasures.Along the same lines as Toy Story and Secret Life of Pets, we just had to know what every type of food and drink were thinking as we grabbed them off the shelf at a market. On paper, this is exactly what I would want Rogen and his writers to tackle. There's something about a sausage and a bun try to escape a market that seemed to fit what Rogen has done in the past. To be fair, they take it in all the directions you would hope they would go and tell all the jokes and innuendos you would expect, but sometimes it's just a little too much.Filled with endless amounts of talent both voicing and behind the camera, Sausage Party always keeps you entertained. There's never really a dull moment on screen, but as the film progresses, those moments just become overdone gags and jokes that tend to take things just one step too far. It's not that I ever wanted realism with this type of premise, but I would have hoped for a little more subtly in certain areas.With all this said, I pretty much got out of it exactly what the trailer sold me. Putting aside the amazing Saving Private Ryan tribute that was shown in the trailer, there's plenty of other pop culture and movie references that put a smile on my face as well. Plus, getting Academy Award level talent like Edward Norton, Salma Hayek, and composer Alan Menken to come on board this ridiculous romp is pretty dang awesome.If you liked the trailer, I think you'll enjoy Sausage Party. It's fast paced and has several insane moments that make the theater experience all the more surreal. The gags go on for too long and the story suffers, so it isn't the most even Rogen pic, but it's worth watching for sure.+Always entertaining+Movie references and tributes+Voice talent-Keeps pushing the same jokes and gags-A little bit too grotesque6.5/10",6,4,9,26 August 2016
There Will Be Blood," Legendary Day-Lewis Performance
","There are few actors who can repeatedly make a repellent character still engaging and do it effortlessly. I would say only DiCaprio and De Niro can do it as good as Daniel Day-Lewis. The man is a legend in film history, and his portrayal as Daniel Plainview will easily go down as one of the greatest performances of all time. While I believe his 'Butcher' character in Gangs of New York is more entertaining and re-watchable, it's this haunting performance that may outlive any of his other characters, including his recent portrayal of Abraham Lincoln.Right from the opening sequence the music engages you into this tale of a man full of hatred and greed. Even in the first 15 minutes which feature very little dialogue, you get a sense of the tone and the overwhelming theme of madness that goes along with Daniel. The movie is most definitely filled with memorable performances, and it is a memorable film. I wouldn't even say the movie is too long, which is what most people complain about. Day-Lewis captures you with every scene, and makes you feel as though these actors were actually living in this era. I was also shocked at it's few moments of violence, especially towards the end. Because the movie is just detailed as a Drama, the violence comes as a complete surprise. Paul Dano shows us his young talent and his ability to perform with the greats, and not even be overshadowed by the great Daniel Day-Lewis. I also found his son to be quite thrilling in his tragic role.Minor complaints include the sometimes bombastic score. There were times it overshadowed the dialogue, which for this type of movie is bothersome. When you have a character piece, I want the music to compliment and not overpower the actors.I cant say I will ever remove the final scene from my head, and I can't say I will ever want to watch this movie again because of how disturbing it can be. There Will Be Blood is truly one of the most memorable movies of the past decade and a true work of art. It deserves a place as a great cinematic achievement.9.0/10",9,0,0,8 April 2014
Joker," This is Cinema
","I might as well be the 9 millionth person to express their opinions on the Joker movie online, but I won't bring any sort of strong thoughts one way or another. I really liked the film, and even if the film doesn't have an intricate plot to dissect, there's certainly plenty to discuss. I've seen a ton of Joaquin Phoenix movies, and I'm not sure he's ever been better. Todd Phillips brings the best out of Phoenix and seems to have a blast playing in an entirely different sandbox than something like The Hangover or Due Date, instead something like Taxi Driver or The King of Comedy. Composer Hildur GuÃ°nadÃ³ttir does a phenomenal job setting the aesthetic and tone with her unsettling score. Cinematographer Lawrence Sher brings something entirely new to the superhero genre. This controversial, provocative, and disturbingly violent film will more than likely be debated for decades to come. Perhaps more than anything else, this is cinema.

Edge of Tomorrow," A Smart and Refreshing Sci-Fi thriller
","I will see anything Emily Blunt does. And let's face it, Tom Cruise is one of the best action actors we have ever had. So when you put the two together, you hopefully get a great theater experience. I have to say after waiting a full weekend to see it, and hearing all the great buzz, it was going to be hard to live up to the expectations. I really enjoyed this movie, especially because of how different it was to any previous Science Fiction movie. The action is top notch, and the chemistry is great between actors. Obviously, the idea of re-living a day several times has been done before, but with aliens involved it becomes refreshing and new. Emily Blunt is fantastic and every scene with her is gold. Cruise, in a very different role, is also good and I'm glad they didn't try to force the romance into the movie.The movie does take a few scenes to get going, but once Blunt steps on screen, she captures your attention. It's great to see they are using Blunt in a different way then before. She is a complete bad*** in the movie, and besides Looper this hasn't been seen before. She has been up for a few different comic book roles in the past so these huge action blockbusters didn't seem too far off. The supporting cast in the limited time they have were serviceable. I'm also really glad the re-living scenes didn't feel repetitive, as they went with the comedic route instead of dramatic.The scenes on the beach were great to look at, but I couldn't help but find myself wanting more of it. There were also a few times the movie was going to end, and when it finally did I was a tad disappointed with the result. The ending didn't seem to fit the overall story. I know they had to find a way to kill these Aliens, but for some reason the ending didn't resonate the way it should have. I also understand they didn't want to feel too much like Elysium, where the lead takes the kill for everyone else. The ending doesn't take away from the incredible action sequences along with Blunt and Cruise' great performances. It's a refreshing take on the Alien invasion story, now more people just need to go see it to help it reach it's budget. Give Blunt more action roles.

Pitch Perfect 2," Won't Miss This When It's Gone
","Considering I went into this film with low expectations after strongly disliking the first film, I didn't think this Pitch Perfect could be as weak as the first, well I was wrong. Where the first one struggled with taking itself way too seriously and up and down tone issues, this film veered off in too many directions and ended up being too goofy and uninteresting. I understand comedy sequels are difficult. But look at 22 Jump Street, that film took the exact same premise of the first and what people liked and executed the same movie with new jokes. Perhaps I'm just not the target audience here. I know a lot of people love these movies and good for them. I'm just unable to see the appeal.This time around the Bella's are touring when an incident occurs that prevents them from continuing their singing. But if they can win the world competition their school will reinstate the group. Almost everyone is back from the first along with a few newcomers, such as Hailee Steinfeld. She plays a new Bella and daughter of a former Bella. She's a good actress (checkout True Grit) but she isn't given enough to do here besides act childlike in comparison to the rest of the team. There's also enough offensive jokes to go around the group just like the last one. And the jokes do hit sometimes, particularly with John and Gail. Fat Amy also has a few laughs but her jokes fall flat more often than not. It's unfortunate, because her character was pretty funny in small doses in the first film. Here, we get far too exposed to her character (in more than one way) and it hurts the fun of it. The film also dives into a romance with her and Devine's character that really took me out of the movie. I just feel like the film wanted to go in far too many directions to make one cohesive picture. With first time director Elizabeth Banks, that's not a good sign.Key from Key & Peele makes a glorified cameo, which improves the comedy, but doesn't do much to further the actual film. He plays Kendrick's boss and famous musical producer for Snoop Dogg and has several funny gags. But none of it seemed to matter in the long haul. Once again the film has several contrived parts to an uneven picture. Why did Aubrey need to be in the film? No real reason other than to make the Bellas go through 'boot camp' to find their sound........ what?? The performances were cool but nothing mind-blowing. The film tackles an underground a cappella competition for a near 15-20 minutes when the final performance and competition turn out to be 5 minutes or so. This film isn't for me and I probably wont be checking out the inevitable 3rd film, I just don't understand the appeal. Especially when you have a character like David Cross' goofy and out of place rip off host, not to mention the Green Bay Packers whose jokes fell completely flat. Along with a contrived filled plot and an unfocused story.+Performances +Key -Contrived moments -Plot confuses itself-Unnecessary characters and arcs -Focused too much on some scenes and not the finale 4.6/10",4,8,36,26 May 2015
Whiplash," Not Quite My Tempo
","I don't think anyone can question Miles Teller's acting talent after watching Whiplash. Matter of fact it should have never been in question, especially after The Spectacular Now or even Divergent. He is getting better with every role and it's only a matter of time before he is also being nominated for an Oscar. J.K. Simmons plays the ultimate jacka** teacher, who looks to other means of educating the Jazz band, abuse. When I say, I don't think there has ever been more of a despicable character I mean it. I can't even describe his character without cursing and wanting to yell in this review. Whiplash is truly an exhilarating experience that anyone with a superior who pushed them too far, can relate to.Andrew (Teller) is a motivated drummer, fresh out of high school and enrolls at the cream of the crop music school. He meets Fletcher (Simmons), who is just about the most strict music teacher on the planet. I never had a teacher like that, but I did have a harsh baseball coach in high school that took things too far at times. You're not a teacher or coach when you make the kids hate what they're doing and despise coming to that class or practice everyday. It makes me wonder how many of these educators we have in the world, and worse, how many are getting away with it. He's the type of man that when he walks on screen you immediately worry for everyone in the same room. Simmons was intense in the Spider-Man franchise, but he is ten times as bad in Whiplash. I think I'm actually afraid of J.K. Simmons now.Miles Teller apparently learned how to play drums for this role, but his intensity and emotional depth is unparalleled here. I can't see how he will be a bad Reed Richards, even with the chaos surrounding that project. He literally put his blood, sweat, and tears into this project, and it showed. That's why it's heartbreaking to see his character change as he gets more lost in Fletcher's world. His personality takes a turn for the worse and it ends up pushing the people closest to him away. Some of the actions Andrew does, or tries to do, to impress Fletcher is intolerable for the audience to see. Because of how much I hated Fletcher, I don't think I have rooted for someone more than I did with Andrew. I can say I will never coach kids or students like this, it's just inhumane.The script is nearly perfect. Some of the lines Simmons says are a few of most malign things someone can say to a person. What's worse is that he knows if you're lying and will flip the script on you if you're caught. Simmons will easily win the best supporting actor Oscar this year, but his character is so maleficent that I almost don't want him to. I do have a problem with the ending. Without spoiling anything, I just wanted more out of it. I would like to think with who these characters are, it would have wrapped up more to my liking. It's almost like the characters stuck too much to who they are, instead of completing their character arc.+Teller's immense dedication +Simmons.. enough said +Exhilarating roller-coaster +Script +Relatable with probably everyone -Ending 8.4/10",8,0,1,25 January 2015
Scream 2," A Little Deja Vu
","If for nothing else, Scream 2 is pretty damn entertaining. However, for the most part, we've seen all of this already in the first film, which is an instant classic. More fun twists, another great cast, and just the same amount of gore certainly help propel the film from being a forgettable sequel, though the pacing is noticeably drawn out here. Most horror films work much better at the 85-100 minute window. Not to say the film isn't entertaining or captivating at times, but it's nowhere near the quality of the first.6.8/10",6,0,0,4 November 2019
It Chapter Two," Derry Never Leaves You
","I don't know that I've ever anticipated a horror film more than It Chapter Two. The first film transcended the genre and created a thrilling and captivating small universe inside of Derry. So inevitably it was going to be difficult for Andy Muschietti and company to capture the same magic they did in 2017. The sequel doesn't necessarily live up to the high expectations of the first film, but it very well may be scarier. The Losers Club 27 years later contained just as much charisma and chemistry as the young kids, including a standout performance from Bill Hader (who continues to prove why he's one of the best talents Hollywood has), and I can never get enough of Bill Skarsgård as the titular It/Pennywise. However, the film is probably about 20 minutes too long and the ending doesn't necessarily stick the landing. But I would be very curious to see if Muschietti puts together one long cut of the film that could almost work as 'mini-series of sorts', coming full circle with the first adaptation in 1990.8.0/10",8,0,0,15 September 2019
"Hail, Caesar!"," Hollywood Fixer
","A Coen Brothers film? I'm in. A Coen Brothers film with the always fascinating setting of 1950's Hollywood? I'll be there opening night. Hail, Caesar! tells the story of a Hollywood Fixer, named Eddie Mannix (sort of based on the real life Eddie Mannix), who deals with covering up several studio and celebrity troubles on a day to day basis in order to keep the public knowledge to a minimum. Out of the 6 or so Coen Brothers films I've seen, this isn't their best. But I can acknowledge that some of their previous films have significantly grown on me over time, like Fargo. But I also can't help but think this film turned out to be a pretty big disappointment.Josh Brolin plays Mannix, and for awhile, the film fixed me into thinking it was one of the best films of the year, just like Mannix would do in all sorts of situations, because for the first hour or so, I was completely hooked. I loved how the Coens chose to represent each of the huge genres of the 1950's, particularly the western and the musical. I had never heard of Alden Ehrenreich before this film, and to me, his performance as Hobie Doyle was the overwhelming highlight of this film. There is a particular scene in which his character is making a transition from Westerns to straight dramas and his director, played by Ralph Fiennes, is arguing with him about articulating his dialogue. That scene made me laugh more than most straight comedies do.Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson also have notable but brief performances and both with equally visually gorgeous looking choreographed scenes. Really, the entire cast is perfect. More surprisingly, for the first hour I loved every scene even if nothing had melded together has a fluid film yet. But that's the glaring issue with Hail, Caesar!, the film by no means works as one cohesive story. The trailers, posters, and all the marketing sold it as an offbeat comedy/crime/mystery film, but the actual crime doesn't carry the weight it needed to. Once you realize why exactly George Clooney's character was kidnapped from completing his film, it makes you shrug your shoulders and think 'well, that was a waste.' I do however think the good outweighs the bad. There's so much to like about every single one of the performances and the first hour is Coen Brothers at their best, but the second half drops off significantly, and disappointingly so. Also, don't expect Jonah Hill to play a prominent role in the film like the marketing tells you, he's in one scene and has 4 lines at most. Other than that, Hail, Caesar! was a fun time at the theater for the most part, even if the second half feels so convoluted, uneven, and uninspired.+Witty dialogue is still there+Perfect cast+Watch out for Ehrenreich in the future, the man can act+Choreography and feel of the genre films are straight out of the 50's-Second half drops off-Doesn't really work as one cohesive film7.1/10",7,7,21,5 February 2016
Jaws," Changed Cinema For the Better
","I don't think its any argument that this can go down as one of the most influential films of all time as it set Hollywood on a road filled with blockbusters. At the time it was the biggest box office hit in the world and for its budget, it was quite an achievement. It still isn't without problems. There isn't much character development and the movie relies heavily on its shark attacks to keep the movie moving forward. But there isn't much arguing the movie's overall significance in the history of cinema.The first few scenes are quite a thrill even with it being almost 40 years later. Once you see the blood cover the water it instantly sends chills down your body. It takes a while for Richard Dreyfuss to get to the screen, who is by far the best part of the movie. But I would still say that the 3 men who are chosen to kill the shark aren't that interesting. But in terms of the look of the shark, I was stunned at how real it appears to be. There are some movies made now that have worse effects than this. It also amazed me at how dumb the people in this movie can be. The people on the beach are ALL aware of the recent shark attacks but yet they still feel they need to swim in the ocean. It reminds me of the citizens of New York during the Spider-Man movies. People in the world aren't that dumb.I was also taken back by the idea to break their only communication to the world on the boat. I still don't know why they destroyed it with a random baseball bat? Why is that on a boat?

The Wrestler," True Heart
","A broken down piece of meat? Mickey Rourke says that several times throughout the movie. And didn't everybody think Rourke was broken down in real life and as an actor? After this movie I can say he still has it. How can you argue? He shows not only is he still in tremendous shape but he can still give emotional depth to his characters. This is a fantastic movie that gives off every type of emotion you want from a film.Darren Aronofsky is always a visually stunning director, and while this film doesn't have any huge set pieces it still benefits from a great script and beautifully directed intimate scenes between its leads. Maris Tomei and the daughter are great in their respected key scenes in the film. The 2 scenes with the daughter are devastating and you really start to feel for this big and not-so-good-looking wrestler who has his life torn away from him, even if it's basically at his own doing. It has to be one of if not Rourke's best and defining role in this business. If directors can only get him to do more of these types of roles, as I know I've heard it can be hard to work with him.Even at it's emotional and depressing core it can be uplifting at the same time. The man knows he has put his life in the gutter and he's just trying to make the most of it. I really liked that he tells his daughter not only how sorry that he is but that he doesn't expect her to even have any love for him anymore. Because even when it's devastating it was at the same time satisfying, if that makes any sense. Love this movie and I highly recommend it.9.2/10",9,0,0,27 April 2014
12 Strong," Incredible Story, Forgettable Film
","It's always amazing to me when I see another non-fiction war story that I was previously unaware of. It makes me wonder how many incredible stories we never hear about because there wasn't a book or a screenplay. 12 Strong, about the 12 Soldiers first to enter Afghanistan after 9/11, is yet another impressive true tale even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's real life counterparts.
The most gratifying aspect to 12 Strong is the interesting bond and relationship between Chris Hemsworth's Captain Nelson and Navid Negahban's General Dostum. The two have such different viewpoints on the conflict in Afghanistan and without much context a few weeks after 9/11, the moral dilemmas the two face are clearly the staple of the film. Even with a mediocre script and direction, there's enough back and forth between the two to keep my attention.
In terms of the actual war aspect to 12 Strong, it's a less than subpar affair. In a day when battles may certainly be more difficult to differentiate between sides, it seems 12 Strong accidentally played into that. While the dialogue indicates clearly to me who is 'in the right', the shootouts in the desert and mountains are sporadically shot and chaotically structured. It really makes it difficult to tell what is happening where and who is getting shot or bombed. Perhaps that's exactly what the director intended because it could be closer to how the war actually is, but it doesn't play as well on film.
Overall, small character moments are what makes 12 Strong worth it, but it ultimately is a forgettable war film with a real life story that is better than what was put to screen.

Kong: Skull Island," 'You Guys Aren't Scientists'
","After the complaints of Godzilla's presence being far too scarce in his own movie, you'd think Warner Bros and Legendary Entertainment would have resolved that by making King Kong the center of his own movie, right? Well, that's not entirely the case in Kong: Skull Island.Originally titled Skull Island, this film feels much more like an exploration into the island itself than it does a King Kong film. With a run-time of 118 minutes, Kong maybe makes up about 25 minutes of that. To be fair, after several repetitive King Kong films, the franchise could use a refreshing take. But if you're going to make a King Kong film, you expect to see the giant ape more than some random humans. So, that's the first major issue.The second, and perhaps far more important, is that the script is downright awful. Even worse, the tone is all over the place. I expected that this film was going to take itself as seriously as the 2014 Godzilla film did, especially after several trailers that were clearly trying to emulate Apocalypse Now. What we got is more along the lines of the humor from a Fast & Furious movie that tries to veer into the seriousness of a DCEU film. Except, the humor never hits. My theater was packed, and not a single joke granted a crowd- wide laugh.However, the film is beautifully shot by Larry Fong and the action is impossible to take your eyes away from. Kong has never looked better, and the final fight between him and other creatures is about as impressive of an action sequence as you'll see all year. But Is it really a shock that every second Kong is on-screen is great and every time they cut to a human that you don't care about, the film dull and boring? When you have the likes of Tom Hiddleston, Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell, and Toby Kebbell there should be at least one character worth rooting for, right? Well, as it turns out, John C. Reilly's 'Hank Marlow' is the only redeemable character worth mentioning. Hiddleston is useless, Jackson is way too over-the-top, Kebbell & Mitchell are annoying, and Larson is merely passable. I like all of these actors, but they got stuck with sloppily written characters that are far from fleshed out. Perhaps cutting out 5 or 6 of the leads and giving that screen time to either Kong, or to add depth to the more significant roles.I'm still invested in this 'monster-verse' because I, like everyone else in the world, can't wait to see Kong & Godzilla duke it out for the 'King' title in a few years. But pushing aside the main attraction for some good looking actors isn't what I want from a monster film. The thrills are a little too few and far in between. So for me, Kong: Skull Island is a big letdown.+Gorgeous to look at+Kong impresses-When he's on screen-Waste of an extremely talented cast-Awful script5.7/10",5,4,7,11 March 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," One Last Time
","And that's it. The end of the Middle Earth saga is here. That is until Warner Bros decides they want another billion dollars and end up squeaking out another cash grab. The Battle of the Five Armies was not only the weakest of the Hobbit Trilogy, but most definitely of all the Middle Earth films. I regret to say that this film was not as epic nor as fun as the trailers made it out to be. The film is just one big CGI mess.The first Hobbit was slow but enjoyable and it got me excited to see where the franchise was going. Smaug was intense but I never felt our heroes were in any sort of danger, which is odd considering the dragon is a hundred times the size of them. And I haven't really been a fan of the new frame rates that Peter Jackson has been using or the fact that basically the entirety of the films are CGI and green screen. It just doesn't feel as real or lively as the LOTR trilogy did. There were a lot of tiny things that this film did to tease that trilogy but it's not as cool when it doesn't really make sense with the timeline. There were some unnecessary cameos but the most disappointing thing was how they handled Smaug. The first ten minutes was my favorite part of the entire film and that's all because of Cumberbatch as Smaug.Luke Evans gives a solid performance and quite possibly the only character I actually cared about. His not-so-buddy Alfrid may be one of the most annoying characters in film this year, and is absolutely out of sink with the tone of the film. Speaking of shoehorned in characters, Legolas, who is not in the book at all, has one of the most pathetic CGI scenes I have ever seen. You will know it once you see it. But there are things to like about this one. Ian Mckellen as Gandalf, although doesn't much to do, is great as always. He shares many of the films best scenes with Bilbo, even if some of them are just to get nerds sweaty about Lord of the Rings. Manu Bennett also plays a very good villain in Azog. Although I will say that the Orcs look scarier when they were humans in makeup in the original trilogy rather than CGI.So even though the film isn't complete trash, you will walk out pretty disappointed. It's almost all battle scenes and you just get fatigued after awhile. I found myself wanting the film to end several times but it just kept dragging on. You don't really care about the characters or feel much danger for any of them. Even when you are supposed to feel for them, the emotional moments just don't work. It's just a really frustrating film and I cant believe i'm having it near the bottom of my 2014 list.+Gandalf & Bilbo +Manu Bennett +Smaug -Fatiguing -Emotional moments don't hit -Alfrid -Don't feel much danger for the characters -Really drags 5.5/10",5,7,14,16 December 2014
Inception," Most Cerebral Nolan Movie Out There
","I decided to go back and review Inception because this would be my 100th review written for IMDb. And Interstellar is coming in a few months so I guess now is a good time to celebrate one of the greatest films of all time. After dozens of times watching this movie I ranked it as my third favorite movie of all time. Rightfully so, considering it's one of the few movies that changed my life and got me infinitely interested in film in general. From top to bottom this is one true cinematic accomplishment. Christopher Nolan created a worldwide phenomena and did it with an original idea. Popular and financially successful movies these days almost always have to be part of a bigger franchise. Inception made nearly a billion dollars while being just a solo outing. This wasn't Nolan's first home run twisting our minds and it won't be his last but he most likely won't create a more original movie than Inception. It's one of those movies that after you see it, you instantly want to go back and watch it again.The cast is flooded with Hall of Fame level talent. Beginning with Leonardo DiCaprio in his first and hopefully not last film with Christopher Nolan. These two created a perfect team and I couldn't have pictured a better actor for the role of Dom Cobb. I love how the movie doesn't give us any back story on his character and almost assumes that planting ideas inside peoples minds is normal. Joseph Gordon-Levitt creates a good balance with Cobb in his role as Arthur. JGL was well known among Hollywood for awhile but Inception catapulted his career to a new level. He doesn't get his roles in Looper, Lincoln, The Dark Knight Rises, or even get to direct his film Don Jon without starring in Inception. Easily some of the best scenes in the movie are him trying to calm down Cobb and understand why it is he cant focus while in the dream world. This is when the beautiful Marion Cotillard comes into play. She plays the recently passed wife of Cobb, but someone who doesn't seem to leave Cobb's subconscious. Her accent and seductiveness was perfect for Mal Cobb and also shared some of the not only epic but also psychologically thrilling scenes.The rest of the team is filled with rising stars Tom Hardy, Ellen Page, and the ever-so-underrated Ken Watanabe. Page is one who in the trailers seemed to come across as annoying and useless but I was pleasantly surprised with how great her performance was. Overall the cast is one of the best ensembles ever put together, without forgetting the always good Michael Caine. But the real praise goes out to Hans Zimmer for creating my favorite and quite possibly one of the greatest scores of all time. 'Time' is my favorite single piece of music, but the rest of the score hits at exactly the right times. It's explosive and also emotionally moving when it needs to be. Zimmer found the perfect mix of brass and piano to use in this Oscar snubbed score.But I think the real reason this film became so popular and re-watchable was because of it's forever debatable ending. What's my take on it? Well after replaying it for years and going back and forth on what my opinion is I would say that it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if he is suppose to be dreaming or finally back to reality. You know why? Because Dom Cobb doesn't care. When he sees his children's faces in the end that was the final straw. He doesn't even bother looking at the top spinning because it means he is getting to see his children. He is accepting the fact that his wife is dead and never coming back and moving on from that fact. I really do believe that he had reached reality but I always love hearing the new theories people come up with. I have basically heard them all at this point but it doesn't matter because Cobb has accepted his fate. True props to Nolan for creating material that people are sure to be talking about for years to come.So after over a decade of Nolan having his idea for Inception he finally got it made. Warner Bros gave him the go ahead after he made them billions with the Batman films and could it have been a better decision? I don't think so. Nolan created a film that has impeccable practical effects with an unbelievable ensemble cast complimented with perfect cinematography and a haunting score. If there's ever such thing as a perfect film this is it. It's one of the few movies that makes me cry thinking about how great cinema is when its done with the care like Inception is. It renews my faith in Cinema.+DiCaprio and ensemble cast give career defining performances+Originality can't be topped +Hans Zimmer's exhilarating score+Practical effects (Hotel Scene) +Forever debatable ending +Gave America Marion Cotillard +Final scene +TIME 10/10",10,1,2,24 August 2014
Murder on the Orient Express," Fun But Flawed
","Who doesn't love a good mystery? Murder on the Orient Express is one of the most famous mystery novels of all time, written by Agatha Christie, and now has two big screen adaptations. The first, made in 1974, was critically acclaimed and featured some of the greatest actors at that time. The second, released this weekend, features another fantastic ensemble cast, and manages to be a serviceable crime-mystery-thriller, if not as exciting or shocking as some would hope.Kenneth Branagh directs and stars as Hercule Poirot, the 'greatest detective in the world'. While the rest of the film consists the likes of Johnny Depp, Michelle Pfeiffer, Penelope Cruz, Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Josh Gad, Derek Jacobi, Leslie Odom Jr, Lucy Boynton, and Daisy Ridley. Safe to say, it's one of the best ensembles any film has ever compiled, and truthfully, they actually do a great job of giving each actor a scene here or there to show their talent. At the very least, I found it nice to have such a famous cast because it's nowhere near as obvious who is at fault when it could be any one of these award winning actors and you would believe it.I think where the film struggles is its script. The problem is with the way the film is constructed. It's very difficult to put together a good mystery, I can acknowledge that. But having the background of the characters pretty much laid out in front of you within the first half of the movie, raises an eyebrow before an eyebrow is supposed to be raised. Of course, I can't get into the major specifics without spoiling the surprises, because there are definitely some surprises. I just found the way the film was written to be interesting and not the way I would have gone about things. I guess my point is, less is more when it comes to revealing things.Branagh brings the most out of the script that he can, even considering the enormously difficult task of balancing serious subject matter with quippy humor. That part of the film is impressive, as is the cinematography and production design. There are mind blowing long shots taking you through the train that bring you right into the Orient Express as if you're just another passenger. Surely, the production design will get a strong Oscar consideration, even if the overall film is a bit of a letdown in terms of award hopefuls.Murder on the Orient Express is far from a perfect film, and can be a bit of a mess in some sequences, but it's an enjoyable film that presents a worthy mystery of telling. Sometimes that's all you can ask for.6.7/10",6,1,5,12 November 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," A Talented Voice Cast Wasted by a Lazy Script With Little to No Laughs
","The Secret Life of Pets lacks the gut busting laughs of Illumination's other features and unfortunately adds nothing new to the animation genre. Without any real heart or memorable characters, even for pet lovers, it will likely end up being disappointing and forgettable.Centering a Toy Story style plot around a group of pets in New York City sounded intriguing, and the trailers even hooked me in a bit. Sadly, the trailers already featured most of the film's funny surprises. People with pets, and particularly dog lovers, will get a kick out of some of the various gags throughout, but there's no substance here at all. It's quite simply a Toy Story rip off with pets that doesn't even really try to be anything else.With that said, the voice talent is impressive here. It follows the similar pattern of animated films getting Hollywood stars to sell the movie rather than getting true voice talent. But at least most of the cast is made up of actors with stand-up background. Jenny Slate, Louis C.K., Steve Coogan, and Kevin Hart are just a few of the voices who lend their comedic talent to the picture. Hart and Slate have quite a few humorous moments, but I can't say I really cared about the story they were in. Unfortunately, that's all film ends up being, a bunch of mini gags with pets without a story to grab onto. I was also hoping the film would take advantage of its wonderful New York setting a little more. Having Taylor Swift's 'Welcome to New York' play as the camera pans around the gorgeously animated NYC parks and landmarks was a great way to open the film, but that was about as good as the film got. It's difficult to truly care about what's happening when there's nothing more to the characters than dull rip-offs of Disney creations. It's not just that the characters of Max and Duke are undoubtedly rip-offs of Woody and Buzz. But you can pretty much go through the entire character list and point to who they are in Toy Story, not to mention just how closely the story follows events of Toy Story 1 and 2. Sure, you get a few chuckles here and there with talented voices leading the way, but the story is derivative and the direction is weak. Which basically just accounts to one uninspired film. +Voice talent+Gorgeous animation of NYC-Uninspired story/Toy Story rip-off-No heart or substance-Utterly predictable4.9/10",4,6,29,20 June 2016
Finding Dory," Family
","At this point, I'll wait another 10 years for Incredibles 2 and Toy Story 4. Instead of unnecessarily cranking out sequels every year or two to capitalize on box office success, Pixar waited 13 years to give us Finding Dory. For me, it was well worth the wait. With plenty of heart along with a well-structured and poignant story, this Pixar sequel will give you all the feels.Refreshingly, I went into the film knowing and seeing little to nothing from the film. I watched the trailers when they were released, but I wasn't wowed by anything from the marketing campaign. With that said, being a huge fan of the original back in 2003, I definitely had high expectations going in. I won't go as far as saying it's one of the best films of this year, but it will be difficult for any film this year to flood me with the amount of nostalgia and emotion that Finding Dory did.There were a great number of skeptics going in about Dory, a great side character, carrying a film on her own. While the supporting cast certainly helped, I didn't have a problem with the heavy focus on Ellen DeGeneres' famous blue tang fish. Not only is her comedic charm back but the tragic backstory of Dory is what sucked me into the film. The first 10 minutes rivaled some of Pixar's most gut- wrenching moments.Besides Ellen, most of the original voice talent is back, and much like the first film, it's impeccably cast. Sure, it's great hearing Andrew Stanton back as Crush, a fan favorite, but bringing in Idris Elba, Diane Keaton, Eugene Levy, a few SNL cast members, and one hilariously meta-cameo was brilliant. But dissimilar to other animated features, the cast doesn't overpower the importance of the story being told.Finding Dory isn't without its problems, however. Perhaps it was due to my attachment to the original, but it takes a while to get used to some of the supporting fish and animals. Eventually, they each serve an important and unique purpose, but their first few scenes are sluggish for sure. Similarly, there was something special about the trip Dory and Marlin took around the ocean in the original, and the adventure here never reaches the heights of the first. That's not to say I didn't appreciate the new spin they took with Nemo and the crew, but it just didn't feel the same.Lastly, there are quite a few leaps of faith you have to take as an audience member in the final act. As we reach the emotional climax, it does get a little messy and convoluted, but the overall emotional arc isn't lost. It just takes a few too many jumps at the end in what is otherwise another gem for the studio. It doesn't necessarily meet the original on many fronts, but there is a certain rush of emotion every time I hear Thomas Newman's score. So Pixar just keeps swimming to greatness as Finding Dory is one of the best films of the summer and certainly of the animated genre. +Voice talent+First 10 minutes+Poignant and meticulously crafted story+Beautiful score once again-Spin on the adventure story didn't have the same effect-Some suspension of disbelief is needed for the finale8.7/10",8,4,16,18 June 2016
Arrival," Story of Your Life
","The one thing I always look for in science fiction films whether they challenge our current viewpoints on reality, humanity, and time. Arrival manages to do all of these things and more. It's yet another masterful job of directing from Denis Villeneuve.I have seen all of Villeneuve's feature length films except for his first, but I think Arrival may be his best work to date. Yes, that includes the beautifully tragic Incendies. And the gripping and visceral, Prisoners. Or the twisted Enemy. And even last year's hit, Sicario. Villeneuve brings the best qualities from all those films and brings them to one of the best sci-fi films in recent memory.What makes Arrival so impressive is that it never forces the audience to take a leap of faith in logic or principles. You know from the very beginning that it's going to be a grounded story told in a slow-burn style, and it delivers. I was never sitting in my seat hoping for a groundbreaking twist or a shocking death, I just let the story be told. And it's quite the story.Amy Adams stars as a linguist who begins to work with the military once 12 massive and mysterious shells appear hovering around different areas of the world. Adams is expectedly amazing and balances vulnerability and strength so incredibly well. The film also balances a surprisingly human story with a global scope well. I knew the original title for the film was titled 'Story of Your Life', but I can't say I expected such a grand idea to feel so personally important, especially for Adam's character. But this balance, was what I enjoyed most about Arrival. It makes for some surprising and satisfying reveals later on in the film.The entire sound department and production design team also deserve a ton of credit. Sometimes you forget how important sound is in films, whether that be a score, random noises, or the lack of sound altogether. I can't tell you how impactful the sounds in this film have on setting the tone and feel of each scene. Equally as important are establishing the visuals appropriate for the tone you're going for. The cinematography by Bradford Young as well as the production design from Patrice Vermette deserve some serious recognition come awards season.Arrival in many ways is an extremely important film right now in our world. It exemplifies what we can do together if we overcome our differences globally. That togetherness is something the film tackles in a refreshingly unique way. Normally, when sci-fi's attempt to tell a story about a potential alien invasion, Hollywood chooses to focus on merely America's side to things. Rarely do we get to see the entire world have to work together to overcome whatever issues the film presents, and that was pretty cool to see. For me, this film is not only important but groundbreaking. Some of the storytelling devices Villeneuve uses to convey language, communication, love, time, humanity and many others are unique and gratifying to see in this particular film. Go see this.+Villeneuve does it again +Adams deserves an Oscar +Use of sound and visuals +Unique +Global and personal 10/10",10,6,20,11 November 2016
Parasite," 'You can't go wrong with no plans'
","I feel like I've said this a lot this year, but no matter the quality of the finished product, if I can confidently walk out of the theater and feel genuinely thrilled that I experienced that film in a theater, it's an achievement on its own. In today's ever changing streaming world, it's important to keep the theater experience alive. Parasite does that immensely well. Captivating, thought-provoking, unsettling, but above all entertaining, Parasite is one of the most unique films of the year. Much like Get Out a few Oscar seasons ago, Parasite manages to reach a wide audience with its shocking direction, while also broadening the scope of your brain through its incredible intelligence in storytelling. I'm not completely sure how I feel about the last 20 minutes, otherwise this could be flirting with a 10/10.9.1/10",9,1,4,4 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Super-Realism
","Reviewers Note: My entire review was erased somehow, so this is a shortened version.Birman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is the type of innovated filmmaking that feels so fresh and necessary in todays age of Hollywood. I think the argument of the film being conceited is valid at times. But Alejandro González Iñárritu just does a tremendous job at creating a new story for us all to remember and recognize come awards season.Michael Keaton plays a washed up actor who used to play a superhero. Only he's trying to reinvent his career and life on stage at the same time as attempting to rekindle his family life. The film comments a lot on where Hollywood is today, and basically how far we have come. Is that a good thing? Well in the directors eyes it seems it is not. Superhero films have taken over film, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing. People love watching them and they are consistently some of the most critically acclaimed films of the year. So in that sense I think Birdman got it wrong.The film does take full advantage of it's cast and crew however. Each cast member feeds perfectly well off each other and translates into several Oscar caliber performances. Iñárritu nails the directing, and Lubezki will and should win another cinematography Oscar. I don't agree with everything that the film is saying, but I think it gave us a sense of just how insane some people become with fame.+Ensemble cast +Seamless directing +Innovative cinematography +Original story -Conceited at times 8.8/10",8,1,7,24 January 2015
The Big Short," An Era of Fraud
","In what is probably 2015 best ensemble piece alongside Spotlight, The Big Short also turns out to be one of the best films of the year. Focusing on the 2008 financial crisis, The Big Short takes a different approach to the crisis than the 2011 film, Margin Call, in that this deals with 4 very different people in their route to take down the banks when they predicted the downfall a few years prior.First and foremost, the cast is phenomenal. Sure, you have Brad Pitt being Brad Pitt, Christian Bale being unrecognizably good, Ryan Gosling bringing humor and charm, and Steve Carell nearly stealing the entire film, but the supporting cast also deliver formidable performances all around. Everyone from Melissa Leo, Karen Gillian, and Max Greenfield, all the way to the great cameos that help serve the story, do a phenomenal job. They aren't just throwaway cameos either, Adam McKay uses them is a uniquely comedic way. Being that this story involves big financial terms and phrases that may be confusing and boring to some (the film acknowledges that), the film takes a break and explains to us what's happening using a celebrity in dummy form.This film is a drama by definition, but there's a large comedic presence to the film that balances it out really well. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering McKay's previous directorial efforts, but it was still refreshing to see, especially in an Oscar bait type of film.If nothing else, these types of films are a wake up call to ensure this doesn't happen again. I knew a little bit about the crisis beforehand, and while this film didn't make my jaw drop in terms of new information, I did leave the theater knowing a lot more than I did prior. I'm sure it will get plenty of Oscar attention with hopeful nominations to Bale, Carell, and McKay. Definitely check out The Big Short+Tremendous cast+McKay's writing and directing drove the film+Self aware+Balance of comedy and drama9.2/10",9,1,4,24 December 2015
The Conjuring," What a Thrilling Finale
","I've been pretty weary of watching The Conjuring for a few years now. I'm not fond of horror films in general, and I wasn't particularly interested in a horror film that was dubbed 'the scariest movie of the last decade.' But as an avid film fan, I owed it to myself to give it a shot. I was not disappointed.A horror film in the theaters is definitely different than viewing it in the comfort of your own home in the middle of the day, but The Conjuring still had a significant impact on me. James Wan brilliantly directs this supernatural flick about a family of 7 dealing with a relentless dark presence in their newly purchased home. It wasn't even so much the demon itself or the endless number of terrifying jumps, but the fact that this was based on a true story.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators who take on the case after the events escalate. I'm sure there were plenty of liberties taken, but The Conjuring is a far more grounded horror film than I expected. Wan does a nice job of building the characters out in full before we get overwhelmed with thrills in the second half. At its core, this is a character piece. And even to a certain extent, a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren. This wasn't a horror film built around scares and gore, it was built around characters. Wan and his writers, Chad and Carey Hayes, deserve a ton of credit for that.Part of the creepiness to this film comes from what you don't see. There isn't a ton of scares early on, and the stuff in camera does a lot to set the mood. But the final 30 minutes is about as thrilling of a finale in a horror film than I can remember. I felt a combination of not being able to take my eyes off the film whilst being absolutely terrified to what was on screen. It's certainly well-acted, but Wan and the Hayes brothers are absolutely the stars of this film.+Thrilling finale+Grounded and well thought out+Takes its time with characters8.7/10",8,0,0,17 October 2016
Scream," Brilliant Horror Satire
","Just as Deadpool is the superhero film that made fun of and reinvented the genre, Scream was that for Horror in the 90's. Constantly making commentary on the state and tropes of the genre, Scream is a horror film for horror fans. Albeit not as frightening as some of the great slasher films of the mid-late 20th century, Scream benefits from Wes Craven's meta direction, and memorable performances from actors who were just starting to gain fame in 1996.This film is notable for killing off a character, played by a very well-known actress (even at the time), within the first few scenes of the film. And although I knew it was coming, it was not any less effective, and proved to be a great way to introduce the 'ghostface' persona. As I've said in many reviews for horror films, the film can win me over with creativity. Scream is very much an homage to the entire slasher genre, but yet it manages to feel fresh and different because of Ghostface's way of killing. The mystery surrounding his/her identity is an intriguing plot point of course, but I was more interested to hear what famous horror film Ghostface would comment on next.It's very much a horror satire, with it succeeding in executing horror trope after horror trope without ever seeming to over do it, Scream is almost like a parody of horror. Leave it to Wes Craven I guess. The only thing I got frustrated with was just how clumsy Ghostface can be, and really, every character. Perhaps done on purpose, there are far too many characters who just don't seem to have a clue how to act in a horrific situation. Again, this was probably just Craven playing with all of us, but there was just one too many trips and falls for my liking.However, with all of the memorable performances and creative horror commentary by Craven, Scream will no doubt go down as one of the more important horror films of the last few decades. 8.2/10",8,0,0,1 November 2017
Prometheus," Visually Stunning
","Ridley Scott's return to the Alien franchise was a divisive one. Prometheus is a fascinating and sometimes thrilling addition to the series, albeit with an imperfect way of going about it.I feel like Scott really wanted to make a science fiction film with exploration at the center of it, and throw in some Alien terror and action to create a blockbuster-y feel. To me, the parts of Prometheus that work the most are when the film is trying to build mythology around the mysterious 'Engineers' and their possible relation to the creation of humans and/or Xenomorphs. Of course, the film rarely makes all of the answers to these questions accessible without analysis, but it interests me far more than another film hanging onto the scares of a two-mouthed creature.The film assembles quite the ensemble, including Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Charlize Theron, Guy Pearce, Sean Harris, Kate Dickie, Benedict Wong, and Idris Elba. Every Alien film's strength seems to always lie with its cast, but perhaps this was the best ensemble of any of the films to date. However, besides Rapace and Fassbender, most of the casts' characters aren't fleshed out enough. In other Alien- related films you made not need as much character development because the film isn't built around its cast, but this film feels more character centric and slower paced than others, hence needed some more work.That's not to say this film doesn't have some great character work. Rapace has a particular scene lying on a medical bed that is some of the best acting this entire series has offered, but I think this film works far better when the vision stays in Ridley Scott's court of directing. His direction and the cinematography is absolutely astounding. This film could easily hold a class as to how to properly shoot cinematography. It's 5 years old and I'm not sure I have seen a science fiction film look more hauntingly real than Prometheus. It's one of those films that you have to admire because of how much work and effort was put into making this Scott's vision from the start.I think the biggest problem people have with Prometheus (even more so than failing to answer all questions) is that it tries to be too many different types of film at once. I know that all of the Alien films pride themselves on chaos, but at least the narratives never strayed too far away. Prometheus' narrative can be a jumbled mess, especially in the third act, and I think that prevents it from coming close to the early franchise's roots. But there's also a lot to love with a little bit of greatest hits moments from the entire Alien series. Hopefully Scott can really bring everything full circle with Alien: Covenant.+Design+Scott's vision+World building-Tries to do a lot at once7.9/10",7,1,3,19 May 2017
Halloween," Slasher Masterpiece
","The slasher genre took off in the 70's and 80's, but perhaps none were as famous or impactful as John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978.Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was an influential film for many reasons, but it specifically did things with its villain that transcended the horror genre. In many ways, Norman Bates and Hitchcock's vision are the reason we got so many slasher films a few decades later. With Halloween, it's easy to see the influence. Carpenter does a masterful job at hiding the villain, or strictly showing him in obscure places in the camera shot. These tactics, along with keeping the blood at a minimum, actually proved to make the film better in the long run. Even if some of those choices were made specifically based on a restrictive tiny budget.The now infamous long-take when we first see Michael Myers kill is absolutely terrifying, and it helps set the tone for the rest of the movie. But these unique camera movements don't end there. I loved the way Carpenter chose to shoot Myers. Yes, some of the later shots of him masked up in the dark are scary, but I almost feel like seeing Myers standing in broad daylight by a bush or a car and stalking his future victims is equally as terrifying.Some of the horror tropes this film falls into can be forgiven, because it was basically the first of its kind to do so. But I do wish they didn't depict all but one teenager as dumb promiscuous sex and drug addicts. It just seemed a bit far-fetched. It's also annoying how careless these characters seemed to be. I mean, how many times did someone blatantly leave a door or a window open in a house or a car? That's not realistic.With that said, when the horror hits, it really hits. The simple premise of having a mentally unstable killer on the loose on a Halloween night is enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Sure, we don't get a ton of reasoning behind the actions taken, but I never felt like the lack of that impacted the execution of Carpenter's story. To me, this is about as good as a slasher film can be.+Looming presence of Myers+Carpenter's directing choices+Score-Characters were pretty clumsy8.5/10",8,0,1,11 October 2016
Wonder Woman," Exactly What the DCEU and World Needs
","To say Wonder Woman is exactly the film we need right now is understatement. Not only is the DCEU in the midst of 2 critical bombs, off-camera issues, and desperate fans, but the world itself needs a bit of saving. There's so much hatred in the world that seeing a character like Wonder Woman set such a beautiful example in her ways is incredibly inspiring, and I mean both the character and the film itself. Action-packed, funny, and surprisingly touching, Wonder Woman is not just the film to save the DCEU, but it could very well reinvigorate the superhero genre once again.I might as well say upfront that Gal Gadot kills it as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. Even after an all too brief appearance in last year's Batman v Superman, I had my doubts that she could lead a franchise on her own. While I can still see some room to grow, her charisma, physicality, and chemistry with Chris Pine is the backbone of this film. Her smile is infectious, her punch is fist pump worthy, and her stature is awe inspiring and admiring. It's almost to the point where I'm having a hard time seeing anyone else in the role.I hadn't seen any of Patty Jenkins work before this, and I became instantly interested in checking out her other work after watching what she did with Wonder Woman. There's definitely some carry over from Zack Snyder's style in the previous DCEU adventures, but I think Jenkins brought in some much needed humanity to this story. Just by looking at the tone of Wonder Woman you can see the clear difference between this and any of the 3 DCEU films. It more closely resembles the heart that Man of Steel brought to the table, but perhaps with a little less bleakness.The film does struggle a little with pacing in the first half, but it does surprisingly well developing characters. I hate to keep comparing it to other DC or Marvel films, but I would have a hard time thinking of a first superhero film (or Origin story) that did this well developing and writing characters. The supporting characters each had their own respected arcs and the relationship between Steve Trevor and Diana is truly something special. It reminded me a lot of Peggy and Steve's dynamic in The First Avenger, innocent and charming. The writing is so good, in fact, that it allowed me to forgive a lot of the late game CGI and green screen, because at that point I was already invested in all the characters.But even with all the action, laughs, and fun characters, it's all about the message. The power of love has been done over and over again in films, but it's rare that it is executed as well as it is here. We fall in love with Wonder Woman's innocence in the situation she's in, and she falls in love with human's drive to do what's right. It's a really powerful message and takes Wonder Woman to levels that I'm not sure most superhero films are able to match. So yes, the film is one of the best action films of the year, and certainly is up there on the all-time superhero list, but it's way more important than that.+Writing/directing+Gadot leads with charisma+Funny and heartwarming dynamic between Steve & Diana+Great action-Pacing a little slow in the beginning9.3/10",9,14,34,1 June 2017
Paths of Glory," Paths of Anti-War
","Paths of Glory is one of those films that really makes you hate war and everything that comes with it. It's a great film that perfectly portrays the many horrors that go along with war. But it doesn't just address the bloodiness and violence, it looks at the psychological imbalance that it gives people during an awful period of time. World War I wasn't perhaps as terrible as the second World War, but it still was a gruesome time for several countries.What I think Kubrick nailed the most about this film was the displaying the vast differences between the colonels and generals personalities to the horrific mindsets that the soldiers have going into a battle. Really, the whole plot of the film is quite ridiculous, but this type of stuff very well may have happened. The film captured the utter loudness that battles create, and even leaves out the music when it needs to. I love a good score but I liked that the battles weren't filled with a bombastic score, rather just the sounds of explosions. I didn't know much about the film, so I was shocked at first to find out it was more than just an epic war film. It was more a look at the trials of innocent men and the sort of dehumanization of them. Kubrick does it well in his later films but his approach to Paths of Glory proved to be different. He implements more emotion and sadness to his characters. This is all evident in the famous final scene, which is probably my favorite of the entire film.So yes the film does become more of a courtroom drama than I expected, but it's a different kind of war film that works. It's a film that deals much more with the political side of war than the battles. But in reality both sides of war are equally as devastating. Especially when you have a story as brutal and emotionally draining as Paths of Glory.+Imbalance of psychological viewpoints +Music hits when it needs to+Kubrick's meticulous directing +Emotional 8.0/10",8,1,3,15 July 2015
Carrie," Vicious and Relentless
","With the utmost respect, Carrie seems very much like an exploitation film of the slasher/revenge genre. In another one of the many films that was undoubtedly inspired by Hitchcock's Psycho, a teenager decides to unload her unusual powers on a bunch of unfortunately sour members of her school.One of my problems with many horror films is the loss of grounded characters who are easy to root for. I feel like many films in this genre focus too heavily on the antagonistic presences in the films that they forget to build out likable and realistic main characters. Carrie doesn't necessarily suffer from that particular problem, but it chooses to surround Carrie, a bullied and reserved girl, with stereotypical one-note characters. Sometimes it works, but I will always desire characters with understandable motivations.So even though there is basically no one likable in the story, Carrie succeeds in that it's an important tale of the damage that bullying can do and the lengths that the victim could go to get revenge. With a limited budget, due to it being the first adaptation of Stephen King's work, Brian De Palma does more with less. And even though you pretty much know what's going to happen, the execution is nonetheless very effective. Sissy Spacek kills it, as she did a whole lot in the 70's and 80's. She's complemented by an equally creepily eerie turn by Piper Laurie, who plays her mother. Yikes. Yes, It's definitely dated, but Carrie is a fun product of its time, and a story/message that should be remembered.+Bloody/fiery fun+Exploitive in the best ways-A few too many unlikable characters7.1/10",7,2,4,22 October 2016
Marriage Story," May Be the Best Screenplay of 2019
","Noah Baumbach's movies have often been hit or miss, but Marriage Story does feel different as it's perhaps as personal of a story as he's ever done or will do. Beautifully acted and superbly written, you can make the case that this is one of the best films of the year & may win the big prize in February. But perhaps its most impressive accomplishment was being relatable for people who've never been in a similar situation. But Baumbach's script deals with very human issues that create a film that feels like it has real stakes. It doesn't feel Hollywood-ized even though it's based on a famous Hollywood couple. Instant recommendation from me.9.0/10",9,12,19,30 December 2019
Straight Outta Compton," Records Left on the Table
","Part of the reason we love and hate celebrities deals with the fact that we live extremely different lives and it's just hard to relate to people who don't go through the same life obstacles as you. This film does a phenomenal job at taking that problem and turning it into one hell of a film, because not only does it bring you directly into the lives of Compton natives turned rappers N.W.A, but it tackles their lives in a way that feels approachable. All things considered, growing up in the suburbs of Chicago doesn't give me much perspective on Gangsta Rap, but I'd like to think listening to N.W.A's music gave me insight into the atmosphere in late 80's LA. Luckily, F.Gary Gray takes their lyrics and creates a masterful world around the beloved rappers. Straight Outta Compton is one of the best films of the summer and easily the most surprising film to come out in 2015 for me.When I was in high school I listened to rap all the time, and being a white male, Eminem appealed to me the most. But I listened to my fair share of N.W.A, 2Pac, Nas, Jay-Z, and even some Wu-Tang. So I knew enough about the golden age of hip hop to be extremely excited for the film. But I was nervous, none of these actors had proved themselves before, and taking on the roles of some of the most iconic artists in rap or just music history is a difficult task to say the least. But all of them, and I mean all of them, absolutely killed it. O'Shea Jackson Jr playing his dad was also a big question mark. He obviously looks the part, but could he capture the mannerisms and personality his father had? Dang right he can. Acting comes from the eyes, and you can make or break a performance depending on how you play a scene with your eyes. Well, Jackson and Corey Hawkins, playing Dr. Dre, were terrific at selling each and every one of the emotional scenes. Jason Mitchell was also really good as Eazy-E. Talk about having to deal with emotional material, Mitchell probably had the biggest challenge considering the fate of E, but he nailed everything. And unlike another film that just came out (ahem Fantastic Four), I really bought into this group as a team and the bonds they all shared. It was clear from the beginning that these characters were from the same background and understood each and every one of each other.Obviously being a huge rap fan, hearing all of the old songs in a theater with great sound systems was really gratifying. The Detroit concert scene was definitely one of the best scenes I have seen all year and a thrilling one at that. But I was so impressed by the way the actors were selling the fact that they made the music and performed it. I know none of them are actually rapping or spinning beats, but the actors and directing sucked me into the performances and studio sessions. It was cool to see 2Pac and Snoop make cameos as they both had a good amount of collaborations with Dre and the crew. I thought those scenes may take me out of the film, but the actors once again sold the performances so well. The film does take a step back in third act because it focused on everyone's solo adventures and veered away from the group dynamic. But that's the material and it doesn't translate as well to the screen as the first half of the movie did. I still loved nearly everything else about the film, especially all of the rap easter eggs and nods to other artists they included.It's also worth mentioning the emotional layer to the film as well. Like I said, usually it's hard to relate to characters like this, but the family like dynamic between the group brought me along with the good and bad times. So I felt for the guys when stuff hit the fan. I was glued to the screen just as much for the dramatic sequences as I was for the insane concert scenes. So overall, I really loved Straight Outta Compton. It surpassed my expectations and is one of the best films based on a music group or artists that I have seen. It's also one of those stories that you wish could have turned out a different way. I wish N.W.A could have figured things out and gave us more music. Because they were pioneers for not only rap but for people to have a voice in music and not care what other people may think or react to what you say.+Surprisingly deep performances +Thrilling concert scenes +Surprise cameos +Rap Easter eggs +Great biopic -Third act stumbles just a bit9.0/10",9,12,46,16 August 2015
Vanilla Sky," Life Extension
","I love the unique style and background Cameron Crowe brings to his films. It's like an unexpected mixture of juvenile wonder and adult innocence that appeals to me about his films. Vanilla Sky is by far his darkest feature, but also the one with the least amount of heart and pizazz. In fact, most of it is just a dull mess.Vanilla Sky is an American remake of the 1997 Spanish film, Open Your Eyes. While I haven't seen that film yet, I can imagine it's probably a little more coherent. The remake poses some thought provoking questions and themes, including questions centered around life, death, dreams, guilt, regret, and a few other heavy hitters. But the way in which those themes are covered is less than impressive. It's a poor pun, but perhaps it isn't too surprising that this film feels very vanilla.The performances were great all around, and became the main driving force for my dwindling interest as the film went along. You can see Tom Cruise's passion for this role dripping through the character of David. This may be the best Cameron Diaz has ever been, as the creepy but seductive Julie Gianni. And of course, Penelope Cruz is great as Sofia Serrano. As much as I love their performances, it's difficult to become invested in any of the relationships when the script isn't where it needs to be. It's a dull screenplay that feeds off your attention span, or lack thereof. By that I mean that the film is only as interesting as you make it out to be. It takes plenty of twists and turns to keep your interest enough, but what's the point of a twist if you don't really care where the characters end up?Vanilla Sky is essentially a melodramatic soap opera disguised as a romantic mystery. I wasn't necessarily bored during the film, but it didn't grab my interest the way a film like this should have. Great acting, trippy visuals, and a classic Cameron Crowe soundtrack wasn't enough to save this dreamy picture.+Acting+Poses interesting questions-But takes too many twists and turns for those questions to mean anything-Dull script5.6/10",5,3,4,5 April 2017
X-Men: First Class," Mutant & Proud
","There are a lot of great things about First Class, but I think the one that sticks out to me the most (even after years and tons of viewings) is that it works as both a reboot and prequel. Even though the continuity has since been mingled with even more, this film did such a great job of resetting the universe without tarnishing what came before.In large part, the strengths of the film lie with Matthew Vaughn's direction. Up to this point, I liked most of the X-Men films, but even the people who have loved the series would say that there wasn't much 'fun' to be had. The original X-Men trilogy took itself very seriously and rightfully so. But there's something to be said for a mutant story that poses similar thought provoking questions and themes like before, while also making a fun adventure out of it. Vaughn does a wonderful job balancing the two.Setting an X-Men film in the 1960's meant having to recast all of the recurring characters. Luckily, casting was something 20th Century Fox had no problem with. I don't think we could have dreamed of a better pairing to take over the roles of Professor X and Magneto than James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender. Perhaps, some would say that the two of them have outdone their counterparts, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan (I, myself being one of those people). Much like the film itself, McAvoy and Fassbender put their own spin on the characters, but bring enough similarity in their performance to understand the connective tissue between the pairs.Something the new trilogy of X-Men films does incredibly well is use the decade the films are set in to enhance the overall story they were going for. First Class is set in the 60's, and uses the Cuban Missile Crisis as the film's climatic sequence. But it uses it in a way that doesn't exploit that event, instead, gives a reason for there to be tension between Charles & Erik. This film and Days of Future Past nail the relationship between those two more so than any X-Men film to date.Going back to the fun stuff though, the rest of the mutants are made up of mostly throw away heroes and villains. No one was really asking for characters like Azazel, Riptide, Angel Salvadore, Havoc, Darwin, Banshee, or even more Mystique. But even as much as these characters could have felt like throwaway characters, Vaughn managed to build them into the story in a creative way. Everyone has their own arc and moment to shine. In fact, my favorite part of the film involves Charles & Erik recruiting, and subsequently training everyone. It's classic superhero stuff.Overall, First Class makes good with its new cast and setting. Matthew Vaughn transitioned what was originally planned as a Magneto origin story into a wonderfully balanced comic-book adaptation. One that nails the characters motivations and mindsets in a refreshing but respectful and realistic way. +Charles & Erik+Recruiting & Training+Score+Vaughn's directing+Setting adds to the story9.4/10",9,2,2,3 March 2017
The Wolverine," Mortality
","Re-watching all of Hugh Jackman's performances as Wolverine has reminded me of a few things. The most notable being that no matter the quality of the film he's in, Jackman has always given it his all. He's put his body through vigorous training and eating routines so that the fans of the franchise have the Wolverine they've always wanted.The Wolverine isn't a perfect solo outing for the clawed mutant. But it's 100% better than X-Men Origins Wolverine from quite a few years back. This adventure takes Logan/Wolverine to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend, Yashida, he saved from the atomic bomb in Nagasaki during World War II. Only, that friend has a little bit more planned than initially lead on. Yashida would like to transfer Logan's healing ability to his own body in order to stay alive and in turn, give Logan the 'mortality he's always wanted'. This idea of mortality as it relates to Logan is a fascinating one, but it's not explored enough to justify an entire plot built around it. Even with his hallucinations of lying in bed with the deceased Jean Grey or walking around like a caveman don't necessarily sell me on his death wish. It feels more like the idea of mortality is forced into his subconscious rather than brought on naturally. Hopefully, 'Logan' tackles this theme in a more interesting way.The other problem with this story is that it ventures deep into a family drama with the centerpiece being Yashida's apparent death. With the exception of a few scenes, it has the tendency to not feel like Logan's story at all. Instead, it's more like a modern-day western where Logan is forced to protect strangers for the greater good, ala Clint Eastwood in 'Pale Rider'. The Wolverine is like Iron Man 3 in that, the movie is fine by itself but it doesn't succeed entirely in being a comic-book adaptation. I understand that this was inspired by a specific run of comics, but the final product sure didn't feel all that worthy.But there are plenty of positives. Jackman's performance goes without saying. It's impeccable. The action, and particularly hand to hand claw/sword battles are tremendous. Dare I say some of the best action the X-Men franchise has seen to date. The sequence on the bullet train is exceptional. But overall, the action and performances only even out the glaring weaknesses. The ending is a letdown and the inclusion of Viper feels completely out of place. Hopefully 'Logan' gives the titular character a bit more of his own story.+Action+Jackman gets bigger and better every time-Viper-Not really Logan's story-Ending7.1/10",7,0,0,3 March 2017
The Dark Knight Rises," An absolute stunning beautiful Masterpiece
","The reason why this movie is my favorite of all time is the ending. I loved how it showed the ultimate sacrifice from a man. He cared so much about this city he would give everything. As Batman states to Selina Kyle 'not everything, not yet'. He gave them everything in the end. As always the movie was supported by great and emotional performances by Freeman and Caine. The major standouts were Anne Hathaway, Tom Hardy, and Marion Cotillard. The few twists along the way will please comic book fans like myself. When I walked out of the midnight release I had goose bumps up and down my body. I couldn't think of a better way to end the perfect trilogy. As this Nolan universe is ending I don't know how any director is going to step into the batman franchise and top what was done in these 3 movies. Everywhere from Hans Zimmer's score to the iconic performances from Bale,Oldman,Neeson,Ledger,Hardy, Hathaway, Caine and Freeman these movies will forever be my heart as the greatest trilogy of all time. I'm so grateful that I grew up when I did. Sad to see it go, but these movies are timeless and will always be in my play list. Thank you Nolan, Bale, and Zimmer for simply creating my favorite movies of all time.",10,3,6,22 June 2013
Black Panther," Groundbreaking
","In the same but different way, Black Panther is bringing on the same amount of significance that Wonder Woman did last year. Of course, it's crazy to think we're even at this point in 2018 where Black Panther (not the first overall) but the first mainstream superhero movie to have a black lead in years and the first one in the now 18 film long Marvel Cinematic Universe.To just say this film is important is an understatement. Diverse representation in films is among the most talked about things in the world of filmmaking these days and Black Panther makes another big step for the industry, especially looking at the box office results of opening weekend. Luckily, the film itself isn't just a step forward in representation, it's also a dang good piece of filmmaking. It should come as no surprise that the guy who made Fruitvale Station and Creed once again knocked it out of the park with Black Panther.Let's start with the cast because even before a single trailer, the cast was the thing that stood out of the most. For me, Chadwick Boseman stole the show in Civil War a few years ago. He made an even bigger impression than Tom Holland did as Spider-Man. His calm but fierce presence was unmatched and brought an entirely different vibe to the characters already in place in the MCU. Boseman, who has already played some pretty iconic people (Jackie Robinson, Thurgood Marshall, and James Brown), is perfecting the role of a lifetime right now.Alongside him is an incredibly talented supporting cast including Angela Bassett, Sterling K. Brown, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, Martin Freeman, Daniel Kaluuya, Letitia Wright, Andy Serkis, Forest Whitaker, and of course Michael B. Jordan. Nobody is wasted and all of them are well-written and fleshed out. Jordan instantly ranks in the top 3 or 4 Marvel villains (which isn't the hardest thing to do), and his performance as Killmonger was full of thoughtful planning and empathetic beats. So much so that I understood what he was doing and why he was doing, even if I don't agree as to how he was accomplishing his goals.But I've gone on far too long without mentioning the ladies of Black Panther. Wow did I love Gurira's noble and powerful turn as T'Challa's guard Okoye, Nyong'o's gentle but courageous turn as Nakia, and Wright's hilarious and energetic turn as Shuri (who is essentially Q to Boseman's Bond). There are other great beats by actresses in the film, but those 3 women are absolutely incredible in this film. There are some familiar story beats from say Thor or Iron Man, but I always say that even if a movie isn't original in story, but is presented and executed in a new way, then it's all worth it. Which is a very long way of saying , Black Panther is a uniquely satisfying piece of cinema that might as well change the way superhero films (perhaps all films) are directed, produced, written, and acted worldwide. Wishful thinking sure, but it seems like there's been a shift since Wonder Woman, so why not after Black Panther?9.0/10",9,36,93,18 February 2018
Iron Man," Brilliantly Kicks of the MCU
","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Iron Man is one of those films that gets better with age. Even though I loved it upon first viewing, I wasn't all that pumped about going back another time. There's been so many MCU films now that it's hard to imagine one without numerous Marvel superheroes in them, but that's what is so brilliant about Iron Man. It can easily stand on its own as a singular superhero adventure, but it also presents the universe as somewhere that could have dozens upon dozens of heroes.At this point, it's hard to think of anyone else in the Iron Man suit but Robert Downey Jr. But it may be equally as hard for Downey to find a role more suitable to his acting strengths than Tony Stark himself. With the recent announcement that Downey will indeed be in the next Spider-Man installment, I can't hope but help he plays this character forever, in every Marvel film. A mixture of humor, wit, sophistication, and absolute charisma, Tony Stark may be the most engaging character in the MCU.With all that said, we only get to the rest of the MCU films if the first Iron Man works, which it does. I love the way Jon Favreau sets the tone for the MCU as undeniably dramatic but with a good amount of comedic undertones so that it appeals to all ages and demographics. When the plot of the film involves a billionaire who develops tech and weapons that end up killing many innocent people, you need some comedic relief to give the film smooth pacing.Favreau also manages to develop a romantic superhero relationship that is something you truly care about without overselling it, an admittedly difficult task. Pepper and Tony aren't your typical superhero damsel in distress type of relationship, but they also don't try and turn it into something it isn't. It's teased just enough in this movie to keep those invested something to hope for in later installments.Of course, Iron Man is one of the best superhero films of all time, but it's also just a really well made film. Sure, the villain, in the form of Obadiah Stane is nothing special, but Marvel has never had the easiest of times creating great on screen villains. But as a whole, Iron Man is phenomenal work of cinema that only gets better with age. It serves as a reminder that you can make a serious superhero film and an enjoyable experience at the same time.+Downey Jr is Iron Man+Romantic relationship that you care about+Perfect tone setting up the MCU9.3/10",9,0,1,22 April 2016
Mother!," A Metaphor that Doesn't Work in the Slightest
","There are certain movies that just aren't my cup of tea. Mother! is the type of movie where your reaction could be predicated on what you expected. Having watched only a little bit of the marketing campaign, I didn't entirely know what I was in for. With that said, Darren Aronofksy has a distinct style in each of his films, with each being highly divisive in nature. Mother!, which could be one of his simplest and yet ambitious films to date, is perhaps the only film of his that I just can't come around to.Because of how difficult it is to discuss the film's plot without giving anything away, I'll just say this is the part of the review where you turn back if you have yet to see it. (SPOILER ALERT). This film is about mother earth and god. Yep, Aronofsky has made another film tied into the bible, except this time, It's a complete borefest. I say this with the utmost respect for the filmmakers, as I can always appreciate a film that does something different with its plot structure, but there wasn't a single moment of Mother! in which I was invested. If Aronofsky set out to make an uncomfortable experience than he can consider this film a success. Seemingly only using soft- focus and close-up shots of his actors, there isn't a single moment of comfort in the entire film. That can work in a movie, if the story is good enough (see. Requiem for a Dream), but if the film is simply plotting along to get to that big exclamation point ending, then it's just not that good.Fittingly, the reviews have been pretty mixed so far. I figure a movie which mostly deals with humans ripping Jennifer Lawrence's earth apart and poorly treating their surroundings isn't the easiest audience or critic pleaser. However, I expected more from this film. Labeling it as a horror-mystery is certainly deceiving. Was the mystery supposed to be on what the film is actually about? Was the horror just supposed to be those last 20 minutes when everything goes to sh*t? I often talk about how an ending can save a film from being mediocre, but I think it can just as easily take an okay film and turn it into a complete let down. I think that's where my main complaints lie with this film, is that it's not at all what I wanted it to be, and the metaphor they were going for (while an interesting idea/premise) isn't executed in an interesting way.As I said, I can always appreciate how original some art-house films can be, and Mother! is certainly no different. But the execution left me feeling dull, unimpressed, and downright bored. So even if there's some cool ideas, I can't give this a positive review.4.0/10",4,14,25,18 September 2017
Creed II," Emotionally Packed Sequel
","Coming off Creed, which in my opinion was the best film of the entire Rocky Franchise, it was going to be tough for Creed II to come close to the excellence of the acclaimed 2015 film. While it's not as polished as the first outing, Creed II succeeds in being a more emotionally satisfying entry with some truly incredible boxing sequences. There's something so special about the father-child angle to this movie, with it focusing on Ivan/Viktor, Rocky/Adonis, Rocky/Robert, Adonis/Apollo, & Adonis/Amara. This is where the film packs the biggest punch emotionally and even moved me to near tears at times. In building those scenes makes every real punch in the ring all the more important, and the fight with Drago contain real consequences. Creed II is one of the best films of the year.9.0/10",9,0,1,1 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Sloppy, Misleading, And Disappointing, With Some Incredible Moments Mixed In
","Well, the wait is finally over. Batman and Superman are in a big screen film together for the first time in history. The result? A sloppy attempt at setting up the DC Universe. Batman v Superman has its moments though with great performances from almost every one and action that could rival Man of Steel, but it was difficult to not walk out of this film and feel overwhelmingly disappointed. For a film that finished filming over a year ago, you would think Zack Snyder and Warner Bros would make all the effort in the world to edit in and out the stuff that's important and tighten the movie, but that isn't the case. It's directed by the aforementioned Snyder and stars almost the entire Man of Steel cast along with Ben Affleck and Jeremy Irons as Batman and Alfred respectively. The performances are mostly great all around, including Amy Adams, who unfortunately felt out of place for most of the film. I have no problem with Adams' portrayal or the character of Lois Lane being in the film, but she was misused and overused here. She and General Swanwick from the first film have several small scenes that are used for us to find out more about Lex Luthor. But the problem is, it's a good 15 minutes of the film that could have shaved down to 3 or 4 minutes worth of scenes.Speaking of Lex Luthor, the casting of Jesse Eisenberg caused a big stew of controversy when it was first announced, and I think it was warranted. I've seen the film twice now and had different opinions both times. The first time I was entertained by Lex but also confused as to why they went the route they did with the character. The second time, I was annoyed by the performance and the over the top portrayal of what should be a menacing villain. A few scenes here and there had those classic Luthor aspects that I've loved from the animated series and films, but the tone they went with for Eisenberg's performance just doesn't work. There's little humor in an incredibly dark film, and Lex seems like he's from a completely different film. The other big problem the film unfortunately has is its title and marketing. Most of the marketing material was well done and proposed 'the greatest gladiator match in the history of man', but the reality is that it's merely 10 minutes of a 2 and a half hour film. The fight itself is phenomenal. It doesn't hold a candle to the fight in the comic book/film 'The Dark Knight Returns', but it's probably the best part of Batman v Superman. The focus was all over the place though. Everything from the fight onto the ending is good cinema, but man does it take a long time to get there. I actually sat in the theater saying to myself 'I'm kind of bored right now'. How in the world does that happen in a superhero film, let alone a Batman film?There are still plenty of great aspects to this film, however. Diane Lane has a few heart-warming and gut-wrenching scenes. Laurence Fishburne provides some good comic relief as the head of the Daily Planet, Perry White. Jeremy Irons gives us our most involved and bada** Alfred to date. Even Gal Gadot, another questionable casting choice, showed acting chops that I didn't think she had here and got me excited for the Wonder Woman film next year. Which brings me to the weirdest part about my feelings about this film. As many problems as there are, it didn't get me any less enthused for the future of the DCEU. Some few surprises in the film, tease Justice League which was neat. And I'm incredibly stoked for Ben Affleck's solo Batman film. With that said, I don't think I can get that excited for Justice League if Snyder still directs. I have to believe many of the directing and editing mistakes came from him. But perhaps even Warner Bros themselves needs to take some of the fault for giving Snyder too much reign? Another positive though was Hans Zimmer's score, unsurprisingly. I loved the way him and Junkie XL managed to weave in Superman's theme with the new haunting Batman theme.Ben Affleck may very well be the definitive Batman. Everyone knew his Bruce Wayne would be great but his Batman does not disappoint. There are scenes which rival the action in the Arkham video games in terms of style, creativity, and fluidity. I couldn't be more excited for Affleck to write, direct, and star in the solo film whenever it may come out.I honestly can't believe I'm sitting here typing an average review for a film that's one of my most anticipated of all time, but I am. There are plenty moments of pure greatness here, but for every incredible scene, there's an unnecessary or strange scene out of place. Sure, I enjoyed the film more the second time I saw it, but I just can't believe how sloppy of a filmmaking job this was. A missed opportunity for Warner Bros for sure.+Affleck+Action+Last 40 minutes are awesome+Zimmer's score+Performances-Except for the tonally off performance by Eisenberg-Sloppy editing-Slow and almost boring first half7.2/10",7,744,1277,25 March 2016
Blade Runner," One of the Most Overrated Films of All Time
","I've now watched Blade Runner twice, and both times I've failed to really understand what it is about this film that people love so much. (FYI, I have seen the final cut and the original theatrical cut). The story is undeniably interesting, and Harrison Ford is at the peak of his acting career, but there's something about it that I just haven't been able to grasp. Granted, the second viewing was more rewarding than the first, likely because my expectations were significantly lowered. However, the slow pace and inconsistent tone are still things that plague this sci-fi 'classic'. I re-watched Blade Runner in anticipation for the upcoming Blade Runner 2049, and perhaps that film will enhance my appreciation for the original, but for now, I'm leaving this film as it is. There are certainly some fascinating things touched upon with Ridley Scott's direction, the replicants desires, the technical achievements, and the detective aspect to the feature. It's just not enough for me to get this film to fresh.5.0/10",5,4,10,5 October 2017
The Greatest Showman," Never Enough
","Same lyricists as La La Land (one of my favorite films of all time)? Hugh Jackman going back to his musical roots? A musical surrounding around a circus with plenty of bombastic visuals and acts? Count me in. My interest in The Greatest Showman kept growing with every trailer and TV spot I saw. The final product is a crowd pleasing but ultimately disappointingly bland and cheesy musical loosely based on the infamous P.T. Barnum.Let me start off by talking about the things I liked. The music is fantastic and nothing short of inspirational and surprisingly moving. Everything from the opening number which sees Barnum as a young boy imagining a 'Greatest Show', to the jaw-dropping ballad 'Never Enough', to the likely Oscar winner 'This is Me', and to my favorite track 'A Million Dreams'. The music is undeniably catchy and exactly what a movie like this needs. In fact, I could have used the film to have more numbers and be closer to a traditional all-sung musical rather than a musical number every scenes. So even though I didn't care for the rest of the film, the numbers are worth the price of admission alone.My main problem with the film, which seems to be a lot of people's issue, is that every single problem that comes up gets solved within minutes. This film is all about struggle and coming from nothing to achieve your dreams. A universal and worthy theme in any type of movie, but it only works if you can experience the struggle along with the triumph. Unfortunately, the story is muddied with plenty of character struggles that create obstacles for the protagonists, but are merely brushed aside a few minutes later with a quick scene.It's also worth noting just how cheesy this film is. I don't like using that term loosely, especially since I usually appreciate 'good cheesiness in films'. Heck there's plenty of musicals I've seen that have a charming cheese to them. But when a film has inconsequential struggles and contrived plot points, it's hard to get passed moments of pure unnecessary cheese. The film has grown on me a little bit since I saw it a few days back, with the soundtrack being the overwhelming reason for me rating this is as a positive review. If I could watch only the musical numbers and skip past every other scene, I think I would buy it on blu-ray. 6.0/10",6,1,3,3 January 2018
Ben-Hur," Holds Up Better Than Some Recent Epics
","There may not be a film so highly regarded in its influence and stature for the history of cinema than Ben-Hur. Luckily, it's themes of betrayal and redemption hold up just as well as the epic chariot race that so many cinephiles hold so dearly to their hearts.Starring the iconic Charlton Heston as the titular character, Ben- Hur tells the story of a Jewish prince who returns for revenge after being wrongfully enslaved by his childhood friend turned foe. Known for its epic scale as a 1950's film, Ben-Hur is still one of the most impressive achievements in film to this day. Not only does the film have a nice mix of green screen work and on location set work, but the performances and work from William Wyler also deserve some credit.Wyler, who also directed one of my favorite films, Roman Holiday, does a brilliant job at bringing this classic tale to life through his actors. It's a great story on paper, but if Wyler doesn't bring the best out of his actors than the story can fall flat and melodramatic. With Heston, and great supporting performances from Hugh Griffith, Jack Hawkins, and Stephen Boyd, the story most certainly does not fall flat.With so many decades passing since the film opened, there's bound to be influences found in other films, but I can't help but draw a comparison to Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Maximus and Judah's story take similar turns, and there's even a massive colosseum sequence in Gladiator that could be seen as a tribute to the chariot race in Ben-Hur. The 1880 novel of the same name had its impact, but the film opened the door for big budgeted ideas to steer their way into theaters for years to come.But speaking of the original story from the book, I feel like Wyler may have been too stuck on adapting what he saw in the pages to the big screen. Both interpretations have a strong presence of Jesus and the idea of faith, but I don't believe the heavy inclusion of Christ's story worked in the film. Judah and Messala are at the core of this story, but by the end, the story is taken over by the presence of Jesus. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but for me, the film ends when the relationship between Judah and Messala is at its climax. Some things just don't translate to film.Anyways, Ben-Hur is every bit as impressive now as it has been for decades. To see the crew's clever use of miniatures in action scenes, seamless green screen work, and a grand scale chariot race makes it one of the most important and influential works of art in the 20th century. It's something you'd have a hard time denying. So although I don't think the last 40 minutes of the film are necessary, I also won't deny the influence the entire film had on cinema.

Casino Royale," Back From the Dead
","It's well documented how much I don't like the Brosnan films but we got a new Bond because of the lack of quality in those films. That new Bond being Daniel Craig. Since this film, Casino Royale, was the first Bond film I ever saw, it has a special place in my love of Bond, and films in general. But it's not just that it was my first Bond, Casino Royale is a great film no matter what.As a new Bond usually does, Casino Royale reinvented the formulaic nature of this series. This all starts by giving Bond one of if not the best female leads of all time. Eva Green may be the first ever Bond woman of the series as she exemplifies pure strength in her vulnerability. She is not a damsel in distress and she is in no way the usual eye candy or sex object that the series can sometimes rely upon. Her chemistry with Craig is undeniable as is her likability as the stunning and seductive Vesper Lynd.It's the longest Bond film upon its release which is noticeable, but it's also used to the film's advantage. There are plenty of twists and turns to go along with some of the series' best action sequences to date. Right from the opening pre-credits to the thrilling climatic scene, Casino Royale blends the best of what modern day CGI and effects have to offer while also showing tribute to the best of what the series offered so far. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, a quietly manipulating investor for terrorists. The first half of the film is non-stop action packed as 007 goes after Chiffre, but it really picks up once Green and Mikkelsen come into play.Casino Royale is in many ways an origin story for Bond. We begin the film with him just being promoted to '007' status. He's careless and very much egotistical throughout the film. But he shows the beginnings to the Bond we love. We don't even here the classic Bond theme until the very end of the film, but everything really comes together perfectly for this movie. I think it may be my favorite of the series because it doesn't rely on the beautiful girls and action sequences to tell a great story. Both of those aspects are very present, but they don't overpower just how great the story and writing are. But I think the thing I appreciate the most about the film is that it treats the audience intelligently unlike the few films before it.+Origin story+Eva Green is fantastic+High powered action+Mixed with a twisted and intelligent plot+Mikkelsen+Not formulaic9.6/10",9,2,6,5 November 2015
Toy Story 3," 'So Long, Partner'
","For a long time, this was considered the perfect end to the Toy Story arc. It was the perfect finish to the toy's time with Andy as the group deal with mortality if they can still live on after their 'child' grows up. Toy Story 3 makes for what may be Pixar's most adult film to date, that still caters towards children in the best comedic ways. Lotso is an unsettlingly cold bear controlling the daycare that Woody & gang get stuck at. But the real win here is the final 20 minutes where my emotions may have been at the most vulnerable they've ever been in an animated film, as Andy says thank you and Woody says so long. Cinema at its finest.10/10",10,0,0,22 June 2019
Bull Durham," As Romantic as the Game Itself
","Who doesn't love a great sports movie? Sometimes sports can provide a nice avenue for a perfect character arc. The ups, downs, and overall weirdness that sports can supply is well encapsulated with Bull Durham.The things I look for in a sports movie are; if the film is accessible to non-sports fans; provides an accurate look at sports from people who do play sports; and if it's able to cover multiple genres, whether that be comedy, drama, romance, or whichever. Bull Durham accomplishes all of those things surprisingly well. Kevin Costner, in one of his 3 baseball movies, gives one of his most memorable performances as Crash Davis, a close-to-retirement minor league baseball player who never got his true shot at fulfilling his dreams in the big-leagues.That's the strongest asset the film boasts, is the bittersweet story of someone who gave it his all and even then, it may not be enough to be successful. Due to me being a ballplayer myself, this especially hit home, because I had those dreams when I was younger. To watch someone struggle for over a decade in the minors and still never get his shot is tough to watch. Luckily, Bull Durham isn't a straight drama, it's got a bit of comedy and a whole lot of romance. Costner plays the catcher (Davis) to a young project-pitcher, 'Nuke' Laloosh, played by Tim Robbins. Davis is forced to train Nuke to use his strong arm to reach the minors and to do more with his life than just lay with the next beautiful woman in the stands. That relationship is the core of the film, as is Susan Sarandon's dynamic and potential romance with them both. Sarandon's character feels a little bit like it was a female character written in a different era and rarely holds up. Think about it, she spends all of her time watching baseball in an attempt to find the next player she can sleep with. Granted, she does offer some useful advice every once in a while, but it isn't anything earth-shattering. I hardly think a character like this would be written in today's Hollywood.Baseball is known as the most 'romantic' sport, and Bull Durham personifies that belief. It's as romantic as it is thrilling and hilarious. That's the thing I'll take away from watching Bull Durham, is how well it balanced the baseball and romance aspects of the film. Complement that with a bittersweet story, memorable performances, and a funny script and you have one of the great sports movies of the last 30 years.+Well-written+Romance & baseball+Back and forth with Catcher-Pitcher dynamic-Sarandon's character motives don't hold up7.9/10",7,0,0,13 May 2017
Signs," Love Everything But the Ending
","Much like The Sixth Sense, it took me probably too long to check out M. Night's faith based thriller, and for the most part, it lived up to the hype. However, the ending and certain plot explanations were laughable and ruined some of the experience for me. But his slow burn approach to this sci-fi thriller is admirable and undoubtedly influential to its core. I almost would have preferred even fewer answers than we got. But if there's one great thing, it's that James Newton Howard score.7.3/10",7,1,1,22 October 2019
Identity," Doesn't Quite Stick the Landing But Still Very Good
","The 'Bad Times at the El Royale' before that existed movie, Identity, is a mind-bending mystery involving a group of people stranded at a motel in Nevada in the midst of a terrible storm. In other words, the perfect elements for a mystery writer. Luckily, the film never dives too deep into over-the-top storytelling like it easily could but rather a dark psychological undertone, reminiscent of Nolan's Memento only a few years prior. The only problem is that with any mystery, the film is only as good as its final reveal. Identity's is solid but not nearly as satisfying as it builds itself out to be. Still worth watching.7.3/10",7,0,0,22 June 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Sometimes All We Need To Do Is Dance
","I've always said that a great ending can elevate your opinion on the film as a whole. Perhaps not completely shift how you feel, but certainly enhance or detract. I was enjoying the ride with Jojo Rabbit for awhile but I was waiting for the film to move me emotionally the way I'd heard it might. The last 15-20 minutes of the movie do just that. Boasting a hilarious script, unique direction from Taika, terrific performances all around, and a message that is as moving as any film this year, Jojo Rabbit is a win on all accounts. And perhaps, just the movie we need at this time. I absolutely adored this film.9.4/10",9,59,101,5 November 2019
X2: X-Men United," Firing On All Cylinders
","The first X-Men is a fine film but it follows a similar formula than plenty of other comic-book adventures. It felt original and fresh at the time, but it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings as X- Men 2/X2/X2: X-Men United does. In fact, X2 gets better every time I watch it. Exceptionally directed by Bryan Singer with just the right amount of action and timely emotion, X2 is one of the best X-Men films to date.I'll always contend that the X-Men films are best when Magneto and Professor X aren't necessarily on opposite ends. Magneto has never been a cut and dry villain. There's always a grey area to him, and I think X2 nails that as well as any other X-Men film. Just like in Days of Future Past, he doesn't have an agenda until he's brought back into chaos. This time, the chaos is brought on by none other than William Stryker. Stryker is in charge of the facility which keeps Magneto captive, and is also the one who holds the answers to Wolverine's past. That in itself boasts some fascinating prospects for the film.But what's more impressive is how well this film once again balances all of its story fighting the 'bad guy' while also having the ultimate antagonist (humans) feature so prominently in the story. It's not to the extent that the original deals with it (registration act), but at its core you know this film is about humans vs mutants. The two butting heads has always and will always be the way to take the X-Men's story.We get introduced to a few new mutants, and an extended look at Pyro and Iceman, but it's Nightcrawler that makes the biggest impression. The opening sequence at The White House is known as one of the best comic-book scenes to date, and rightfully so. It's terrifying and thrilling, which doesn't really describe his presence throughout the rest of the film, but it's quite the opening. Iceman is used more as a love interest for Rogue than anything else, but Shawn Ashmore is charismatic enough to verify his presence. Pyro, however, feels like the prototypical kid who was inevitably going to turn on his friends. You never truly believe that he's going to stick it out on the good side.With much higher stakes than the first film as the human race is at risk, it's no wonder the runtime is significantly longer than 2000's X-Men. There is rarely a second wasted, but having the entire last hour of the film take place at Alkaline Lake was risky. With so many mutants running around, it's easy to find someone to take up screen time, but that's a long time to spend at one particular location. So I can see where it may feel a little long and dragged on by the time we leave the place.The important thing here is that Singer keeps us on track with the story he wants to tell. It has more action, characters, and surprisingly more heart than I expected. X2 is a triumph on almost every front and set the franchise up for limitless possibilities and adventures. Unfortunately, we all know what happens in X-Men 3.+Balanced+Magneto blurring the lines+Emotionally resonant+Higher stakes-Could have done without Pyro9.0/10",9,1,1,20 February 2017
Lucy," Garbage
","It's hard to believe that i'm reviewing this film in February, considering how excited I was to see this film. I would have guaranteed that I would have seen it in theatres. The trailer came out almost a year ago and it instantly became one of my most anticipated for the summer. It's Scarlett Johansson in a Science Fiction based action film, what can go wrong? Especially with the writer director from Leon: The Professional and Taken? It had so many good things going for it, but sadly it was poorly executed.Johansson still had a great 2014 with The Winter Solider and Under The Skin, and she sure earned a lot of money from Lucy. But I think she has to regret how Lucy turned out. It tells the story of a random girl who gets a drug injected into her stomach, in turn allowing her to access her entire brain. Now I have heard from multiple people that we as humans in fact use much more than 10 percent of our brain. Apparently it's actually close to 100 percent. Even putting this aside the movie is garbage. There is absolutely no depth to these characters. None of the supporting characters are given material for us to care about. Even in Lucy's case, the only glimpse of depth was a short phone call to her mother. I guess I'm just not the audience for Artificial Intelligence films. Transcendence, A.I., and now Lucy. Here's hoping that Chappie can right that ship.The film also uses several strange cuts to animals reproducing and other tasks. But it's not like it's in an intelligent and ambitious way, because the cuts stop 15 minutes into the film. We don't get any sense of why they chose to perform this procedure on Scarlett or any back-story with this drug or the people behind this deal. It's a really dull film that is saved by Scarlett Johansson's solid performance and some surreal special effects. It was enough to make the film watchable for 90 minutes but I cant see that being the case for any longer. It tries to be much more ambitious and smart than it actually is. I would much rather have seen a revenge type story with Scarlett going after the gangsters, much like a Taken style film.

Amélie," Beautiful Yet Underwhelming
","Here's a film that looks gorgeous and has a beautiful story, but nothing executes really how you want it to. It has likable characters and a lovely setting but there's a sense of warmth surrounding the execution that is lacking. Amelie is a good film that many say is an all time great. I don't particularly see it that way.I really cant stress to you enough how beautiful this film looks. Paris is supposedly the most beautiful place on earth and going along with all the colors and paintings that this film has it creates a great atmosphere for a film. Audrey Tautou is about as likable as an actress as you can get even with her limited dialogue. But even though I really felt for all the people's lives she was changing, I didn't actually feel for Amelie.The story is cool and will definitely connect with many people but not everything fit together as much as say 'Big Fish' did. It didn't live up to that grand storytelling that some other films have. With that being said going through all the little clues with her was a great ride. I just wish the execution would have been a bit different.+Beautiful +Likable characters +Paris -Execution -Didn't feel for the characters 7.1/10",7,1,4,30 October 2014
The Sixth Sense," No Re-Watchability
","The problem with a film so synonymous with a shocking twist or an ending reveal is that there isn't much value to re-watching such a film. Sure, there are plenty of good things about The Sixth Sense, but I can't help but think without the famous twist, this movie would have been just your average thriller.Being a huge film fan, it was always hard admitting that I haven't seen M. Night Shyamalan's 'masterpiece', The Sixth Sense. But because I've known the twist for years now, I had a difficult time mustering up the motivation to watch a film knowing its ending. I can't stand knowing endings going into the viewing experience. With that said, there are a lot of things about this film that are good, so I'm mad at myself for taking so long. But also keeping that in mind, I hardly believe this film was best picture quality, nor deserves to be on 'all-time great' lists.Besides the twist, The Sixth Sense is perhaps most notable for being the coming out party for Haley Joel Osment, who plays a child with the ability to see and speak to the newly perished. He, Toni Collette, and Bruce Willis are the best things about this film. The performances alone make it worth the price of admission, with Collette being the clear standout for me. And Willis perhaps hasn't given as good of a performance since.The problem for me is that knowing the twist going in really tramples any sort of enjoyment I had. The 'thrills' weren't all that thrilling and the plot seemed to never truly pick up pace until it was too late. That falls on the shoulders of Shyamalan and his directing. I feel like people were so enthralled with the late-game revelation, that they forgot how plotting the first hour and a half feels. There's a lot here I liked, but it's nowhere near the high praise that people give it.+Performances carry the film+Emotional connection is felt towards the end-Plot drags-No re-watchability6.4/10",6,0,1,26 October 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force Has Awakened
","The wait is finally over. After years of wondering if Lucas would make more of these or if he would sell the franchise elsewhere (Disney), Episode 7 is finally here. I was never into Star Wars as much as the majority of the population. I loved the movies, but I wasn't staying awake at night thinking about where the Jedi are now, that is, until about a year ago when the first trailer came out. After seeing the Force Awakens twice on opening night, I'm now one of those hardcore fans. With that said, I don't see how anyone wouldn't love The Force Awakens. It's full of nostalgia for the longtime fans, plenty of humor, great effects, and some of the most emotionally driven action sequences I have seen this year. It's directed by J.J. Abrams who is responsible for reinvigorating life into the Star Trek films a few years back and expanding it to reach a broader audience. Star Wars didn't need a bigger audience, because it's easily the biggest pop culture phenomena of all time, but Abrams does a fantastic job nonetheless. Even more so knowing just how difficult a job it is to make a film that not only starts a new trilogy but honors what came before it. Abrams handles that seamlessly.Even though it's 30 years after Return of the Jedi, it's a sequel, so there's a ton of ground to cover over the course of one film. There's still a ton we don't know about those 30 years and a few times where the term 'old friend' comes up and some people may feel cheated on the history. Perhaps a worthy complaint, but the real brilliance of The Force Awakens is with all that is new about the film. The comparisons being drawn to A New Hope, are warranted. Some characters and even plot lines, especially the final battle sequence, but as I said, there's so much new life that was given to the series with The Force Awakens that rehashed ideas are forgiven. Speaking of the new, the entire cast is great, but the newcomers are most definitely the highlight. Starting with Daisy Ridley playing Rey, who's literally in her first film, is incredible. Abrams said her acting was wooden initially, but no sign of that at all. A scavenger before she's somewhat forced (no pun intended) into the chaos, Rey is smart, strong, and best of all independent. Leia was such a great character in the original films partially because she wasn't the damsel in distress, and Rey is the same. She doesn't need saving from the men of the film, in fact, more often than not she's doing the saving. Rey and BB-8, who nearly steals the entire film, meet Finn, played by John Boyega, early on before being joined by other familiar faces. Rey and Finn's chemistry is well realized and luckily nothing in their relationship is forced, everything seems natural.With all the good, you have to have bad, this time the big bad is Kylo Ren. Obviously going into anything involving his character and most other characters would be a spoiler, but I will say that I really enjoyed him as a villain. Don't make the mistake of thinking he's just the next Darth Vader, he's not. Much different in many ways, but I really liked how human the character turned out to be. Human meaning there's depth that I didn't think would exist and that was really refreshing. With that said, I have to say the other villains were pretty much wasted in my opinion, at least for this film. I didn't like Domhnall Gleeson's General Hux, the look of Supreme Leader Snoke seemed a little bit too fake (I know it was motion capture), and Gwendoline Christie barely got to do anything as Captain Phasma, literally nothing. I guess that's one downfall to having a massive cast. I'll also skip talking much at all about the original cast members who return, besides what you see in the trailer. Harrison Ford as Han Solo was a joy to see back in a film. You can tell he's actually trying, Ford isn't mailing anything in here, he cares. Abrams does a wonderful job of re-capturing the feel of the original crew with callbacks and nods to the old trilogy. But Lawrence Kasdan's script also does that thankfully by simply giving us the dynamics we all loved between characters in the originals. But how could I forget the most nostalgic part about the film is hearing the iconic John Williams score once again. The score doesn't add a ton of new flavor to the series, but it sure feels like Star Wars.I'm sure I'm leaving out a ton, but ultimately, this film should be seen with the least amount of prior knowledge possible. I've seen the film twice now, and both times the crowd cheered and clapped just by seeing the Millennium Falcon for the first time, or the first time you see Han Solo. It's a movie going experience that will probably never be matched. There's something about watching a film with people who have been waiting for 30 years that makes it extra special. The action is great, the entire cast does a phenomenal job, and the film does plenty to set up future installments with so many questions left unanswered. But I think what I enjoyed most of all was that every scene had weight. Every laugh was warranted, every tear was heartfelt, and every scene was full of some sort of emotion gravitas. Abrams really did well with hitting the big moments with The Force Awakens, and I think that was really important. Star Wars is back.+Ridley as Rey was incredible+Nods to originals, but paves a new path as well+BB-8+Lightsaber battles have emotional weight+Questions left unanswered-Some characters were definitely pushed aside..dare I say wasted?9.5/10",9,4,30,18 December 2015
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The Ultimate Sacrifice
","To me, the perfect conclusion to a franchise ties up everything that was promised while leaving the audience with an emotionally satisfying ending that leaves the door open for something later. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 checked off just about everything I could have asked for.We begin part 2 still in search of the Horcruxes as well as finding Voldemort's army at its strongest. I think what's most impressive about this particular installment is that it manages to pull off the 'all pay-off' type of story that most part 2's have struggled with. Both, The Hunger Games and Hobbit series' have had a rough time closing out their series' with a film that feels whole in itself. Sure, you can't really have the full experience without at least watching Part 1, but there's no part of me that thinks this story could have been pulled off in one film.Even with all of the cameos and reappearances of beloved characters, there's plenty of new ones as well. Ciaran Hinds' Abeforth Dumbledore for one, Helena Ravenclaw, a nearly-blind Dragon from Gringott's, and oh yeah those kids at the end. J.K. Rowling has a knack for giving everyone a chance to shine, and there's no difference in Part 2. Seriously, I never would have thought Neville would be the one to kill Voldemort's snake, Nagini, but that's why it was so brilliant.This is also the film in which all was revealed about Snape and his allegiance to Harry after all. The first time I watched this entire sequence, it absolutely broke me. To watch a guy so hopelessly in love with someone he can never have, and then look after her son even though he despises the very presence of him, is so beautiful and tragic at the same time. It's something only the likes of J.K. Rowling could handle with such grace.Harry himself goes through perhaps his biggest character arc since the middle of the franchise as he's forced to come to grips with the fact that he is the 7th horcrux after all. Even though we ultimately knew he was going to have that showdown with Voldemort at Hogwarts, but his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, and ultimately his discussion with The Order in the Forest, were some of the most touching scenes the franchise has given us. This also gave us one final scene with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore's spirit, so to speak. Of course, I'm a bigger fan of Richard Harris' work as the great wizard, but Gambon's spin on the character definitely grew on me. Especially when watching them all back to back.Everything about this film is epic in scale and emotion. Even if you know when certain things are going to happen, they are written and presented in a way that's undeniably satisfying. I know some think the '19 years later' scene is hokey, but for me it's the perfect culmination of everything that the series has brought thus far. Harry finally got to experience King's Cross Station with his family, and he honored Snape and Dumbledore with his son's name. It's just perfect. After re-watching the 8 films within days of each other, I can say that this without a doubt in the top 5 of my favorite film franchises of all time. And The Deathly Hallows ended it with a bang.+Everyone gets a chance to shine+Battle for Hogwarts+Snape reveals+The ultimate sacrifice+19 Years Later10/10",10,1,2,19 November 2016
Unbroken," Moment of Pain is Worth a Lifetime of Glory
","Unbroken was one of the most anticipated films of 2014, not only because it's the first major film directed by Angelina Jolie, but that it's one of the most incredible true stories of triumph survival. I think if I would have seen this film in theaters when it came out and was surrounded with the buzz, I may not have liked it as much as I did. In fact, I think one of the reasons I thought Unbroken was a solid film was because my expectations were significantly lowered after everyone said it wasn't as good as everyone thought. I still don't think it turned out to be as good as everyone thought it would be around this time last year, but it still can be enjoyed.It tells the story of Louie Zamperini, a former Olympian who is stranded at sea for nearly 50 days, before being captured by the Japanese. The story is absolutely incredible. These are the types of stories that should be legends. Humans aren't supposed to go through this much pain and come out on the other side, but somehow and someway, some people do. Zamperini, who only just passed this past year, has inspired so many people with his will and determination to make it to the finish line (no pun intended). The film honors that, and just about every other extraordinary thing he did during his life. But I think the problem was just the organization of the presentation of those events was the issue in the film. I was enamored with the opening shots of the aircraft and the battle. But then the film immediately calms down and flashes to his childhood. I really liked those scenes, but I don't know that the placement of them in between intense battle scenes and the ensuing crash was the best idea. It slowed the pace down unnecessarily. With that said, the rest of the film doesn't do that and has a consistent pacing from then on out so that was nice to see.The several (and I mean several) defining moments that Zamperini has throughout the film were cool and shot very well by the legend cinematographer Roger Deakins, but they didn't hit as much as I would have wanted them to. When I think of survival movies, or just movies with unbelievable stories I always think of their defining moments and memorable shots from the film. Braveheart, Gladiator, and Gravity all have those iconic moments, and I just didn't feel that from Unbroken. It's not always a necessity, but the trailers made it seem like their would be. It's a beautiful film with a terrific story that surrounds it, but the execution could have been better. With that said, Jack O'Connell gives a wonderful performance as the lead and is surrounded by a surprisingly gifted cast. There isn't a lot of well known talent, but Gleeson, Hedlund, Courtney, and Ishihara give the film credibility that I thought it would have been lacking. The film is also complimented with a magnetic score by the brilliant Alexandre Desplat who chooses only the right moments to make the music noticeable, and it's really effective.Zamperini's time in the concentration camp is defined by his relationship with 'The Bird' played by Ishihara, and I really liked that dynamic. I'm not sure how much the film followed the actual events and book, but there's something that happened with that dynamic that felt rushed and too forced. It was something that I didn't think needed to happen, even if it was straight out of the book. So I really enjoyed Unbroken. It has some flaws in screenplay and direction but I don't think the fault lies anywhere in particular, it just wasn't as good as everyone had hoped.+Magnetic score +O'Connell +Incredible story +Cinematography -Pacing issues towards the beginning -Big moments didn't really hit 7.2/10",7,0,1,30 May 2015
Munich," An emotional, character based drama
","Steven Spielberg has done it again. He is one of the best Sci-Fi directors of all time but he also shines in Non-fiction dramas as well. Personally I think this is much better than Lincoln, but not nearly as good as Saving Private Ryan. It dives deep into how Avner had to deal with the psychological troubles assassins go through. Eric Bana plays the lead and gives the character much depth that I think the other characters struggled from. May very well be Bana's best performance in his career. Daniel Craig was also good as one of his four partners, (Pre James Bond days). What I really liked about this film was the fact that they didn't cut out the Israeli's as the heroes. As dark of a film as it is, it needed lighter and more pleasant scenes, and you get that with Bana's family, lead by the beautiful Ayelet Zurer. It's truly a great historical piece, no matter how close it was to depicting true events or not. John Williams also added intensity with his score, and the cinematography was great as well. I can't really say it was an enjoyable film, considering people were being killed every 15 minutes, but its an interesting watch. Especially if your not familiar with the terrors that occurred in Munich. 8.3/10",8,1,1,14 March 2014
Pitch Perfect," Disney Channel Movie on Steroids
","When a movie like this gets great ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and even my well trusted friends, I expected great things. But in reality the movie is clichéd and relies way too heavily on popular songs to please the audience. The writing is poor and the funny moments are rare to come. As much as I love music, films focused on music or musicals are never my thing. Pitch Perfect is obvious not a musical, but it's pretty close to a Camp Rock film with a PG-13 rating. In reality, the film could have easily passed for a Disney Channel movie if it weren't for a few swears and sexual jokes.Anna Kendrick stars as Beca, a hopeful DJ who is pushed into joining a college a cappella group by her father. Sound like a Disney film so far? Just wait until the film is then flooded with an excessive amount of clichéd 'dramatic' relationship moments. We have the prototypical jealous girl who wants to do it her own way but is eventually accepting of the new girl, Aubrey. The overweight character who provides comedic relief by making fun of herself, Fat Amy. Finally, the guy who is on a rival team but falls for her anyway and of course there's a falling out and rekindling just like every other film. Now, there are some redeeming qualities which include Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins strange and outrageous commentary during the performances that give us a few chuckles. Rebel Wilson also has a few funny moments but for the most part the jokes fall flat. The performances are entertaining and well choreographed but it doesn't save a below average film.There are just several contrived moments such as the fight scene that put Beca in jail for a little bit. It's scenes like this and one where Adam Devine's character just flat out leaves the movie that make it a poorly structured film. It turns out to also be incredibly predictable which can be forgiven if the movie was fun to watch, which it wasn't. I just hope the second one is more enjoyable. Just because these films aren't my niche doesn't mean I cant enjoy them, so here's hoping.+Performances & mash-up of songs +Rare funny moments from Banks and Wilson -Contrived plot elements -Disney channel clichés -Cringe worthy writing 4.8/10",4,0,1,26 May 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Don't Fall Asleep
","Not many films really dare and try to encapsulate the mysterious relationship between the dream world and reality, but A Nightmare on Elm Street is one of the few films to tackle it, and have a ton of fun in the process.Directed by the horror legend, Wes Craven, A Nightmare on Elm Street came out right around the peak for the 'Slasher' film. (some even credit it for revitalizing the genre) The popularity for the genre and the film specifically is obviously through the roof. But I was interested to see just how well it holds up 32 years later, especially for a casual horror fan like me. But it surprisingly fared well for my tastes. Certain aspects, such as the vintage 80's soundtrack/score are a bit dated, but the ideas and themes can live on for multiple generations.The premise of having a serial killer haunt and murder people in their dreams is a fascinating idea, and one that plays extremely well in a horror flick. Not being able to sleep with the lights off is one thing, but not being able to sleep at all is another thing entirely. It's a villain you can't run away from or kill the way you can kill a normal person, which definitely adds to the mystique and wonder to the great Freddy Krueger. At first, you question what the real stakes are for a villain who is essentially a fantasy in a few teen's imagination, but Krueger certainly puts an end to that question rather quickly.Craven brings plenty of nuance and uniqueness to the story, but I do think the dialogue and acting could have been a little bit better. The cast isn't full of Oscar winners or anything, but I wish I would have been more attached to the characters so that when Freddy strikes, it's a meaningful death. However, I give Craven credit for pulling a bit of a bait and switch in terms of main characters and obviously finding the talent of Johnny Depp.A few logic issues and character tropes don't prevent this from being one of the horror classic of the 20th century. Simply Craven's imagination is enough to give this film more than one look. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a treat even the most hesitant horror fans.+Craven's neat direction+What an ending+Dream/reality ideas-Dialogue/acting could be improved8.1/10",8,0,1,9 October 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Among the greatest sequels ever made
","(Saw in theaters on opening day, reviewing after re-watching Blu-Ray) Let me preface by saying, I first saw the Hunger Games not knowing any characters and not caring much at all, basically forced into going. After the first movie I became very intrigued about what the sequels could be. I have not read any of the books but I now consider myself a huge fan. I didn't really have high expectations for the second one, but boy was I blown away.This movie is quite simply a masterpiece, and easily in the top ten all time sequels. To me it had the similar impact to The Dark Knight and Empire Strikes Back had on me.Impression- The trailers definitely had me wondering, and because I didn't read the books I was asking myself why are they being thrown back into the ring? There was a good explanation after all. It was the third quarter quell so on this occasion each of the existing victors are to be re-entered into the Hunger Games to battle for all the marbles. I really think this movie was much more well done than the first. Francis Lawrence did a fantastic job and I'm very pleased he will be back for the 3rd and 4th movie. This movie has one of the greatest tag-lines ever as well. 'Every revolution begins with a spark'. And really once you know what that means, you realize how awesome this book probably was to read. Sitting on the edge of your seat as you find out that Katniss was Plutarch's plan all along, she is the Mockingjay, and she IS THE REVOLUTION. I'm glad I didn't know about Hoffman's character twist, and it came as a surprise to me. There is so much good to this movie that I really only have one complaint....Complaints (minor) - It takes too long to get to the games. 90 minutes into the movie we finally see them in the arena. I would have liked to see much more character interaction in the arena instead of Gail-Katniss time. Besides that I don't think there's anything wrong with this movie.The whole film looks beautiful. I'm really glad they got rid of the shaky camera from the first, and that these games are more colorful and brighter. Come to think of it this may be Jennifer Lawrence's best performance. American Hustle and Silver Linings Playbook are great but the emotional depth she brought to Katniss this time around is unparalleled. I cant imagine any other actress being this good as Katniss. This is truly one of the greatest sequels ever made and I don't know how they are going to top it.Overall its fantastic, and not as scary as the first so I can see more families enjoying this one. Not to mention it features one of the most bad-ass cliffhangers in film history. I loved the transformation of Katniss' face from devastated to wanting to kick Snow's ass. Loved it9.8/10",9,4,22,27 March 2014
Godzilla," Highly Entertaining Summer Flick
","This was my first time seeing a Godzilla movie, and I'm glad it was because of how great the special effects are. At this point there's really no need to go back and watch the old movies. This one is good but not great. The scenes with Godzilla are easily the most thrilling scenes all year. I saw it in 3D ETX and when Godzilla roars you can feel it throughout the whole movie theater. But the film suffers at times from focusing too much on other monsters. I think I can say that the two other creatures had more screen time than Godzilla himself.The human characters are fine but lets face it, weren't we all disappointed when they killed off Bryan Cranston in the first 15 minutes. I was thinking this would be the role after Breaking Bad that would put him with the Gary Oldmans of the world. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is good and I can see some future star power in him and Elizabeth Olsen in the forthcoming Avengers movies and inevitable spin-offs. I liked their chemistry but none of the dialogue got my emotionally moved the way I had hoped. Even though the last 15 minutes are incredibly intense, where was that the rest of the movie. There's just too much time spent on the human characters rather than Godzilla.I really have no idea what the main storyline of the inevitable sequel will be. I mean I feel like these movies are better off being standalone movies instead of franchises. The sequel could surprise me but there's something to be said about the shock that people have when they first see Godzilla. Im assuming there will be some sort of human character who wants to create huge robots or other monsters much like Transformers 3.I really enjoyed this movie and if your going to see it, see it in theaters. The 3D is useless and you really don't even notice it. This movie is meant to be seen with an audience on a huge screen. A few problems here and there don't diminish the thrill you get while seeing this.+truly thrilling experience+Godzilla anti hero?-not enough Godzilla!8.0/10",7,2,5,19 May 2014
Life," Goodnight Moon
","If the Alien franchise never existed, 'Life' may be considered a groundbreaking movie in the sci-fi genre, but obviously that's not the case. The good thing is, 'Life' doesn't hide the fact that it's clearly inspired by the original Alien film. Because it's extremely well- acted, paced, shot, and structured, the similarities don't really matter. 'Life' is just a heck of a thrilling time at the movies.I can appreciate original science fiction as much as the next guy, but when you have a film that is as entertaining from start to finish as 'Life', I don't need every scene to be something out of 2001: A Space Odyssey. 'Life' stars Rebecca Ferguson, Ryan Reynolds, Jake Gyllenhaal, Hiroyuki Sanada, Olga Dihovichnaya, and Ariyon Bakare; written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick (same guys who did Deadpool); and directed by Daniel Espinosa. There's nothing overtly new or refreshing with any aspect of 'Life', but at the same time, the film fires on all cylinders. At a brisk run-time of 103 minutes, 'Life' never slows down. It reminded me a lot of 2013's Gravity in that way. The only time these films stopped to breathe was to add subtle but vital character depth to the story. Scene after scene is filled with terror, intrigue, and impressively shot action. It doesn't have the polished cinematography that the aforementioned Gravity or Interstellar does, but what films do? Life succeeds in nicely timed long takes, shocking deaths, and a terrifying creature named Calvin, but it doesn't always nail the emotionally gripping sequences. However, what struck me most was the film's intelligence. All of the characters acted exactly how I would imagine these particular people would act in real life. Although some choices could be perceived as illogical, you have to put yourself in their shoes. Having an extremely dangerous life form trapped on your spacecraft isn't the most ideal situation, after all.With stellar performances from the entire lead cast and it's single celled antagonist, 'Life' is one of the best films of the year thus far. Shocking, gruesome, and relentless, 'Life' manages to avoid falling into the forgettable sci-fi territory. It's better than I could have hoped this Alien knockoff would have been. If everything goes accordingly, we will have two great Alien films this year. +Great cast+The best Alien film since 1986+Relentless tension-Doesn't pack enough emotional punch9.2/10",9,27,51,23 March 2017
Deadpool," The Best Adaptation of a Superhero
","In what has probably been the greatest and most outrageous marketing campaign for any film, Deadpool finally made it to the big screen. No X-Men Origins Wolverine doesn't count, because there is absolutely no way we can call that character Deadpool, and luckily, this film takes a few stabs at that. Nonetheless, it has been a long road for the 'Merc with a Mouth' but I think now is the right time. With the abundance of comic book films pouring out every year, Deadpool brings a refreshing take on the genre. Much thanks to his daring comic creators in the 90's, he's an uncompromising, foul mouthed, anti-hero that has fun doing what he's doing. That's a great way to describe this film, insane fun.The film tells the relatively paint by the numbers narrative of Wade Wilson falling in love with Vanessa, played by Morena Baccarin, and then having to look for a cure to his terminal cancer. Enter a Weapon X like program run by Ajax, played by Ed Skrein, who offers Wilson the chance to become cured from his cancer and also gain special abilities. The film is told in a non-linear structure for the first hour or so which can feel a little strange at first, but after a few scenes you grow comfortable with it knowing the chaotic and absurd nature of the character of Deadpool himself, thus a non- linear structure fits the bill.Ryan Reynolds was absolutely born to play Wade Wilson/Deadpool. Over the last year or so seeing all the marketing material, we have gotten plenty of reasons why he was the perfect fit for him, but I still went in with reasonable expectations. There are a lot of great characters in the film that have fun playing alongside Deadpool, but make no mistake, Reynolds is the star of this film in more ways than one. Reynolds has had difficulties in the past with picking the right roles to fit his strengths, but this is the role that will define his career, and I sure hope he sticks around for awhile.Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead provide us and Deadpool with the extra heroes and X-Men characters that help Pool against Ajax and crew, but also confirm to the audience that he does have the potential to crossover with the X-Men at some point. Deadpool's banter with them two makes for some of the best comedic relief of the entire script. Not only that, but they served a purpose for the character of Deadpool in his emotional arc of the story and also the physical arc as well.First time feature film director Tim Miller does a brilliant job bringing a lot of people's favorite comic character to life and Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese do an impeccable job writing the screenplay. I came out of this thoroughly entertained and with a giant smile on my face. Surprisingly, it didn't have anything to do with the well choreographed action sequences, the hilariously placed cameos, or the perfect after credits sequences, but the fact that the writers, producers, director and everyone involved, got this character right. It's only been a few months since Fox messed up another one of their comic book properties but the fact that this film started of the 2016 superhero slate with a bang just makes me happy. For all intents and purposes, this film is made for nerds, myself being one of them. It's made for those who begged Fox to make a Deadpool film all these years even after Ryan Reynolds got stuck in Green Lantern Hell, another area in which Deadpool enjoyed poking fun at. In reality though, I think everyone can at least enjoy themselves watching the film. They pitched it as a love story for Valentine's Day weekend and you definitely get that. Vanessa and Wade worked well together and a love story that you care about in a superhero film is usually tough to come by. There's something for everyone here, but those who truly care about this character will appreciate it the most. Whether it was presence of the X-mansion, ripping Hugh Jackman/Wolverine, surprising Batman and even Marvel universe nods, the amount of easter eggs are endless. This was the Deadpool film we all wanted to see, and boy did we get it.+Reynolds is perfect+Dirty, brutal, and hilarious+Spot on interpretation of Deadpool+So many easter eggs+Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead fit in well9.2/10",9,10,25,12 February 2016
300," Became very influential in its style.
","(just saw 'Rise of an Empire' so I'm going back and reviewing this) This movie is how the world really became aware of the massive talent that is, Zack Snyder. Without this film we would not have the great Man of Steel, or even Watchmen the way it is. Snyder became known for his slow motion comic-booky feel of directing. I know many people who are in love with comic books who believe Zack Snyder is perfect for directing them because of the amount of detail each scene looks like its source material.300 is great because it actually gave a back story to its lead male, instead of focusing on the villains. We got a fresh new take of Leonidas, who is of course known as one of the bravest and also most daring warriors in history. Its the underdog tale of those 300 men who for some reason thought they could win against more than 300,000 Persian soldiers, lead by the god Xerxes.The battle scenes will go down in history as really starting the trend of ancient battle sequences being shot in slow motion and with as much blood as one camera can cover. There are some all time memorable quotes by Leonidas in some all time memorable speeches. So much so that professional athletes have referenced it when preparing for games. Its a really enjoyable movie from the ground up, and you have to realize how much this movie influenced its genre. The visual effects and photography are standouts, and so are the lead performances, even Lena Headey (lead female) has memorable scenes. As stupid as it was for them to battle the Persians, you do start to feel for them, in how depressing it is that no one came and helped. They did spark the beginning of the end of Persians reign. Good watch. 7.8/10",7,0,1,17 March 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Everything You Hope For And More
","Part of the genius of Matthew Vaughn's films is his ability to blend genres. Whether it was First Class, Kick-Ass, or even The Debt, he has time and time showed just how versatile he can be. This film is straight up awesome. I found myself laughing at just how ridiculous it was, but it worked. The film is also incredibly funny by itself make no mistake about it. It's also very self aware, much like the Fast & Furious franchise, in that it toys with the fact that it knows it's insane and has fun with it.I have to say though, I didn't have high hopes when they announced the film a few years back. Why would Vaughn leave Days of Future Past to work on some film called Kingsman? Luckily, both films turned out to be terrific. The casting directors also deserve a lot of credit for finding Taron Egerton. Talk about a young kid who should probably be looked at for the new Peter Parker, man does he have talent. He also has something that other possible candidates don't necessarily have, which is comedic chops. This film has more laugh out loud moments than the recent SpongeBob film. Samuel L Jackson gives us many of those humorous scenes, as this is probably the best he has been in quite some time. His trusty Bond villain-esque sidekick is also a bright spot. Or perhaps the cinematography and special effects crew should be credited for just how seamless these action scenes are. This is likely the closest we will ever get to a non Gareth Evans Raid film.The film is also impeccably unpredictable. It's refreshingly to see the action genre get revamped a little bit. Even the best action films can be predictable at times. It's funny because I feel like I should have seen some of the twists and turns coming, but it's a tribute to Vaughn's directing that I didn't. Some may say that the action can be a little bit too over-the-top even for a film that acknowledges it's own boundary-pushing. There was one moment where I thought it probably didn't need to take it that far, but it was still immensely entertaining. I really do hope that this spawns a franchise. Egerton has a lot of potential, and this world deserves to be explored further. It's a film that even my sister, who isn't particularly a fan of these types of films, really enjoyed the experience. It's a much better choice than that one other film people are seeing this weekend...+Egerton's surprisingly good performance +Samuel L hasn't been this entertaining in years +Unpredictable +Over-the-top action works+Potential franchise -Don't get too obsessed with that ridiculousness9.3/10",9,3,9,13 February 2015

Not exactly something overtly different than other stories from him, but Kurosawa brings a new dynamic to the tale. It's everything from devastating and depressing, to thrillingly brutal.

Apollo 13," Houston, We Have a Classic
","This movie came out almost 20 years ago, so going in I was a bit worried the movie wouldn't hold up effects wise. And that I had been spoiled by the recent space movies such as Gravity, Star Trek, or even Man of Steel. While technology has come a long way since 1995, I think Apollo 13 does hold up. And that is thanks to director Ron Howard and the entire cast of the film.When I say entire cast, I mean it. There are a number of great actors who were involved with the overall greatness that this movie was. Ed Harris is once again the bright spot of the film. He can do no wrong in any role, and Gene Kranz is one of his most iconic roles. This role even helped him get the speaking only part in Gravity. Hanks, Paxton, and Bacon formed a good trio inside the spaceship, though I would preferred Sinise. Sadly it does take awhile to get into space, a near 40 minutes before lift off. I understand you need to set up the emotional side with the family before capturing our heart strings in the final 15 minutes. But to do that you also need to have capable cast members as the family. Which in my opinion were the major weak spot. You don't really get to know the children at all, and Hank's wife doesn't do anything that we haven't seen out of worried family member. It just wasn't what ill remember this film for. I will remember it for showing the amount of hard work that hundreds and probably thousands of people had to do to save 3 people. It just shows you what a little teamwork can do.I thought the pacing was nice, especially for a 2hr 20 minute film. I also found it fascinating how many steps go into just one particular task while aboard a spaceship. Comparing it to one of my favorite films Gravity, there's a lot more going on. But Gravity's story is probably more remarkable because it was just one person. It isn't a true story like this one so when a miracle happens in the film, you know you're watching something that has actually happen. Where would I put this amongst the all-time space films? Not sure, but it would have to crack the top 10. At least until Interstellar comes along.So in all, with a tremendous cast with a truly unbelievable story, this film can be enjoyable and thrilling at the same time. Just remember that this happened and that human beings were able to pull through that day and save human lives.+Great ensemble cast +Thousands save three +Pacing +Score -Family members didn't care about8.4/10",8,1,1,24 August 2014
Fast Five," New Breed of Fast & Furious
","Ah, the film that kicked off the new breed of Fast & Furious films, Fast Five. The film that gathered all of the fan favorite characters from previous films into one gigantic ensemble. Throw in Dwayne The Rock Johnson and you have yourself what may be the best the franchise will ever be.I've had a hard time ordering which F&F film is actually the best/my favorite. 5,6, and 7 all are tremendous. They know exactly what type of film they are and what type of film they're not. Perhaps Fast Five takes the cake for being the first to truly embrace the ridiculousness of the franchise. Even with the previous film, there was a little bit of tone deaf at times with the writing. However, Fast Five takes the series to a whole new level in terms of tone, characters, and even genre.In many ways, this was a soft reboot for the series. Essentially, the characters become superhuman with qualities they just didn't have before. As far as I'm concerned, Tej was never a tech genius, Mia was never able to hack into police scanners, and Roman was never scared of anything. All of those were added in to service the story they wanted to tell in Fast Five. You know what? That's completely fine by me. A soft reboot was exactly what these films needed. If that was what we needed to do to have the characters pull off an insane heist and have a blast doing it? I'm all in.The Rock (aka franchise Viagra) adds another layer to the film as well. Gone are the days where Dom & Brian are going after one another. Now, you have 260 pounds of pure muscle going after the entire crew, and boy is it worth it. Not only is it mind-blowingly entertaining to watch Diesel and Johnson fight, Johnson actually brings a lot to the role of Hobbs. These movies have always been keen on establishing an inner code/morals for each character, and Hobbs' code works well alongside and against Dom's. Apparently, the role was originally going to be Tommy Lee Jones, but I can't imagine anyone better than The Rock to play him.Much like the previous film, Fast Five does a great job of reestablishing past relationships, developing new ones, and doubling down on the action. This series is half about family and half about how insane each stunt and action sequence can be. By this point, they nearly abandoned the street racing part for the heist angle, and it works. Heck, even the one time they do have a 'race', it's entirely off-screen. Fast Five is the epitome of what the series has become and I'm not sure a film has matched the incredible pacing and contagious chemistry between the ensemble.+Enter, The Rock+Dom vs Hobbs+Doubles down on emotion & action+Soft reboot serves the series well-Even if some of the character changes don't make much sense9.5/10",9,1,1,12 April 2017
Green Book," Everyone Can Learn Something From Everyone
","I'm all for crowd pleasing movies. I'm the guy that loves The Intern, Eddie the Eagle, and this year's Instant Family. Green Book falls into a similar category to an extent, but it attempts to be a little more than it may have earned. The crux of Green Book is the bond and chemistry between Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), and in this vein, it succeeds immensely. It's their back and forth that proves to be a powerful viewing experience in the theater. However, what the film tries to save about race, sexuality, & class feels very surface level and cliched. It works consistently but not to the point that other films have in recent years about similar subject matters. And perhaps it's not trying to be anything more than a crowd pleasing movie about friendships and criticisms like mine won't seem fair, but if it's going to be considered for best picture, then it should be brought up. In the end, it's about how everyone in the world has something to learn from somebody, no matter race, gender, nationality, or sexual preference.7.5/10",7,3,8,8 December 2018
Da 5 Bloods," Excellent
","Spike Lee really nails exactly what a war film needs with Da 5 Bloods, well-shot action/battle sequences, great tension, and a group of soldiers you fall in love with over the course of 2 hours. And even better, he bends that formula even more by having veterans return to where they fought in Vietnam to both return the remains of their fallen friend, as well as the treasure they once hid all those decades ago. Lee also makes a few interesting choices in the flashbacks that grew on me after a while and in hindsight, clearly add to the dynamic the soldiers have with each other. The 3rd act doesn't close out the film as well as I would have hoped but it's easily on the higher echelon of Netflix original films over the last few years. Da 5 Bloods is great though.8.2/10",8,1,1,2 July 2020
The Great Escape," Classic Film With An All Time Great Cast
","This film is special, and not only because of the utterly catchy theme music, but because of the execution. Everything from the award nominated film editing, to the seamless cast and tension throughout the last hour, the film is a masterpiece. At first the music didn't seem to fit, but after while you realize the genius behind that classic tune. The actors are all perfect in their roles, and I particularly enjoyed Steve McQueen in the lead. It was my first taste of the Oscar nominated actor, and he couldn't have made a better impression.I really liked the links I saw to Shawkshank Redemption, which obviously was influenced by this classic WWII escape movie. From the moles they had, to the removing dirt/stone by shaking it out of their pants, you can easily tell the influence it has had. I also liked that while Steve McQueen is considered the lead by default, there really wasn't an actual screen time lead. There were roughly 8 actors who shared most of the screen time, and it was directed perfectly.But I would say the lack of a defining villain was the reason it wasn't a perfect film. For a movie that nears 3 hours, I would have liked to get to know the main bad guys of the camp more, which would have made the final escape even more thrilling. I didn't know the actual outcome, so it did surprise me who made it out and who didn't. The movie is quite a thrill for being over 50 years old and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves WWII stories, or just watching great acting.+Brilliant ensemble cast+Actual Thriller+Catchy main theme-Lack of a defining villain9.4/10",9,0,1,1 June 2014
John Wick: Chapter 2," Professional Courtesy
","A film with more head-shots than words spoken, John Wick: Chapter 2 is just about the most violent film I've seen in quite some time. But it knows exactly what it wants to do, and succeeds immensely.Keanu Reeves isn't one of the best actors working today, and I don't think he would disagree with that statement. But he's no doubt one of the most committed actors out there. There's no more than a few pages of total spoken dialogue throughout 'Chapter 2', and Reeves has probably a maximum of 30 lines, all of which aren't necessarily delivered as well as they should be. But it doesn't ultimately matter. Sure, John Wick could be a better franchise if the scripts were of the same caliber as say a Bond or a Bourne movie, but that's not really why you go see one of these movies. You go to see Keanu Reeves kick some butt amidst some of the best choreographed action in cinema.Chapter 2 picks up not too long after the first film ends as Wick is somewhat enjoying his life as a 'retired' assassin. If the first film was about him coming back to seek revenge, this film is Wick reluctantly coming back because he owes a debt to another assassin. I don't think the filmmakers truly could have imagined this would be a franchise off the bat, but it's sure shaping up to be quite the intriguing universe. The one thing that has always struck me as appealing in this series is the way they portray the world Wick lives in. Yes, it's present day, but the world that surrounds Wick is heightened to make for more exciting action (it's essentially a world full of super assassins). But at the same time, the films are incredibly grounded with reality. It's that balance that so few films can accomplish to this particular level.Taking the famous Liam Neeson line 'I will kill you' to a whole new level, Wick claims 'I will kill them all'. And that's pretty much your movie. Wick doesn't want to come back, he owes a debt and is forced to return for one more kill, and then the bounty on his head reaches just about everyone linked to The Continental's database. The rest of the movie is Wick delivering killing blows to just about anyone who stands in his way in the most creative ways possible. Isn't it about time people leave this guy alone? Overall, John Wick: Chapter 2 promised visceral action (all impressively in camera- yeah, I'm looking at you Resident Evil) and we got just that. Even if the dialogue can be clunky and the performances are over the top, it doesn't really matter. What matters is this series continues to be a pleasant surprise in an age where great action movies are too few and far between.+Insanely well-done action+Tops the first film's scope+The universe Derek Kolstad has built-Some dialogue is bland and even lazy8.6/10",8,25,45,14 February 2017
Annihilation," Gorgeously Terrifying
","Once again, I have to reinforce how much I love original science fiction films. Yes, Alex Garland apparently took some liberties with the source material, but the feeling I had watching Annihilation was unlike anything I have had in quite some time, perhaps since seeing Interstellar in 2014. The wide range of tone and emotion this movie can display is unbelievable. I went from being invested in the intellectual elements of this sci-fi feature, to beyond terrified of the creatures that inhabit 'The Shimmer', to fascinated by the mind-blowing choices the film makes in the third act. In every sense, Annihilation is a unique piece of art.The main story thread sees Natalie Portman's 'Lena' team with Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason leigh), Anya (Gina Rodriguez), Sheppard (Tuva Novotny), and Josie (Tessa Thompson) in an attempt to figure out why no human life form seems to come back after visiting The Shimmer. It's both a science fiction adventure film, as well as a psychological horror/thriller. All genres are equally as compelling to see play out here.While it can be a slow moving film at times, its methodical pace plays into the epicness of the ending in my opinion. You may not be as impressed or as shocked by the events of the third act if you don't get a confusingly plodding first hour and a half. And I say that in the most affectionate way possible. I don't like building up the suspense or anticipation for a film to people who haven't seen it, but it's worth noting that I'm still buzzing after it's been 5 days.There's no sense in trying to explain some of the events of the film or what it means, considering I myself am still trying to figure out beat for beat, and it's better to go into this film completely blind, as I mostly did. However, I can say that the performances (by an all female lead cast) are terrific, the special and practical effects are terrifying and beautiful, and the direction is brave. From a science fiction perspective, you can't really ask for any more than that.9.5/10",9,8,22,1 March 2018
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Peculiar, Bloody Horror
","I'm always down for a horror film that switches up the conventional tropes of the genre. Interview with the Vampire certainly does that, but it also fails to capture one's undivided attention for a full 2 hours.Coming out in 1994, this was the very beginnings of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt's rise to fame, and that plays into a lot of the fun with the film. Cruise plays a seasoned vampire, Lestat, who seeks out a partner in crime, Brad Pitt, to be the next vampire along his side. Pitt had dealt with plenty of loss in his life and so a step away from his normal life and into the immortal life isn't the worst thing. But Lestat's harsher ways of living prove to be too much for Pitt's 'Louis' character. And there you have much of the first half of the film.It's pretty weird watching these established actors back when they were obviously taking on more risky roles such as these. I can't see either of the two taking on a vampire film now, so I guess that adds to the uniqueness of this film. There's plenty of bloody fun to be had with the film. There aren't a ton of scares, which is disappointing, but there's no shortage of obscure Cruise monologues and slasher twists.With that said, the film takes an unexpected turn about half way through, and the rest of the story falls of the rails because of it. So much so that the first and second hour feel like completely different stories. Mixed in you get a touching arc about Louis taking in a young Kirsten Dunst, who is surprisingly great (at only 12 years of age), but it's not enough to overcome a really weak second half.To me, the film is at its best when it explores the dynamic between Louis and Lestat, and lets Cruise and Pitt go crazy with dialogue and peculiar actions. Once we dive deep into why there are vampires and Antonio Banderas' character, the film falls flat.+Cruise & Pitt playing strange/creepy vampires+Bloody fun first half-Flat second half5.8/10",5,1,3,16 October 2016
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Nonsense Comedy
","I have never been a huge fan of spoof comedies or just comedies in general. I'm much better served watching an intense drama thriller or kicking back with a summer blockbuster. So when I watch movies that tend to poke fun at other movies it doesn't seem to connect as well with me as it does with others. I didn't find Spaceballs to be that funny, and same with Monty Python. No with that being said there a few scenes in Holy Grail which are laugh out loud hysterical but as a whole it fell short.Perhaps the build up of so many people telling me to check out Monty Python for years may have raised the stakes a bit too high. One of the first scenes in the forest when Arthur cuts off the limbs of a random knight was unbearably funny. I can see that it's the type of scene that I will go back and watch on YouTube for years to come. Besides that I didn't enjoy much else. The cartoons that weaved in and out of the film were cute at first but grew old after awhile. I found that once they broke off individually for there own adventure the film took a hit. Much of the characters are just stupid, not funny. But the bunny scene was so strange that I thought it worked.With these type of comedies it's really you love or hate it, but I think I'm a bit in the middle. By no means do I hate this movie or what it's trying to do, but I don't know I will ever watch it all the way through again. Though the ending was basically perfect and worked as a way to show just how absurd this film actually is.+It's a flesh wound scene! +Ending +When the group is all together-Ridiculous characters (and I know that's the point) -Built up too high-Toilet humor doesn't work at times 6.0/10",6,0,4,8 October 2014
Minions," Minion Overkill
","The first two Despicable Me films were such a surprise in both their humor and their heart. Minions looked to be one of the most entertaining films of the summer as it focused on everyone's favorite characters from the Despicable Me films. Unfortunately we were left with a mildly entertaining but overall forgettable film. But I also understand that as a 21 year old male, I'm not necessarily the target audience and so I can see the appeal that all the young kids and families will have. But I bought into all the trailers and was really excited to see the movie, it just turned out to be a big disappointment from my high expectations.The worst part about giving this film a 6.2 is that the entire movie is pretty much shown in all the trailers. All of the great jokes, some of which I still laughed at in the film, were shown in the various 3 min long trailers we saw. I really do feel like if I would have stayed away from all the trailers I would have enjoyed the film a ton more and laughed hysterically like a lot of people did in my theater. But trailers aren't supposed to do that. It shouldn't be that we are forced to stay away from the teasers and clips so that we aren't spoiled for the film. Trailers are released to sell the movie, not spoil the movie. The various voice talent does a fine job but it was nothing memorable like Steve Carell's Gru. Sandra Bullock plays the main villain, Scarlett Overkill, but she isn't given a whole lot to do and in fact, the film just doesn't have much substance at all. Yes, it is still funny and entertaining to watch the Minions run around in madness, but there was something to be said about the story around the humans in the Despicable Me films. Minions were great in doses, but they were really missing that heart from the family storyline.So with still quite a few laugh out loud moments, but no gut-busters, Minions failed to capture the magic madness that the other films did. But it is a fun time in the theaters with plenty of short funny scenes. It's just that at feature length, the film doesn't hit on all the levels that the trailers promised. It's more of just a shut your brain off kind of kids comedy, and I expected more.+Creative gags +Villain-con +Voice cast does what they can -Trailers give way too much away -Not much substance 6.2/10",6,5,9,10 July 2015
Incredibles 2," Carbon Copy of the First, With Some Great Action Mixed In
","It took 14 years for an Incredibles sequel, and for some, that was far too long. I spend a good chunk of my time online reading articles and watching videos related to movies and television. I can't think of a single movie that people clamored more for than another Incredibles adventure. I like the first movie, but it would fall very far down the list of Pixar movies for me. So when they finally announced a sequel a few years ago, my reaction was pretty much nothing. Really, I just needed reassurance that if you're going to make a sequel 14 years after the original, there better be a darn good reason to do it. Well, after seeing the end result, I can't really think of a good reason why Pixar pulled the trigger on this one (other than the obvious - money). Is there anything overtly refreshing about Incredibles 2? Nope. It's predictable, unorginal, and uninspired. What I will say is that there are some very impressive action sequences and it was nice to see Elastigirl take center stage. Watching Jack Jack do his superhero-y things is also a joy to watch. However, the first film had a sharp script with just as much laughs as it did heart, and an obscure villain that somehow worked. I can't necessarily say the same about Incredibles 2, which falls into the trap of a rehashed script and a horrendously botched villain. Is the film entertaining and worth a glance? Perhaps, but if you're looking for something that improves on its predecessor, you should look elsewhere.6.8/10",6,2,6,21 June 2018
Inside Llewyn Davis," INSIDE this character drama you will find....
","And here comes another Coen Bros film. Another film with some very memorable characters led by the somewhat newcomer Oscar Isaac. He is basically the only lead in the movie, everyone else is a glorified cameo. Besides perhaps Carey Mulligan, who is great as the ticked off ex-girlfriend type. The whole movie comes off as a depressing journey for a man who cant find himself. The deeper meaning is he cant move on from his best friend and music partner committing suicide.Praise- The look of the film is great, so much that it was nominated for an academy award for cinematography. Even without much of a climax, the Coen Brothers work their magic and do a great job directing. They always find a way to make their characters memorable. Even in the Big Lebowski (which I think is a highly overrated film) I remember some of the lines of the infamous 'The Dude'. I really liked that they threw the cat into the mix as the heart and soul of the movie. It truly symbolizes his music partner and that he finally realizes how to let him go and move on. Man does Davis struggle through most of this movie though. It really seems like nobody cares for this guy and the only people that actually allow him to stay more than one night are the Gorfein's. Perhaps they are the parents of his former partner?Complaints- I don't have many problems with the movie, as the writing is pretty much flawless as is every other Coen Bros movie. I would say for me, the movie didn't pull me in emotionally as much as I wanted it to. I had heard it has as much heartbreak as Pursuit of Happiness. It just didn't thrill me as much with the emotion.As a whole its a great small film that has some great deeper meanings of loss and getting over something that haunts you and eventually makes you hit rock bottom.8.3/10",8,0,0,30 March 2014
Spectre," Ghosts From the Past
","Coming off what is widely considered to be the best Bond film of all time, Skyfall, Spectre had big shoes to fill. While the film does not hit on as many notes as it wants us to, this is still a very solid entry in the longest running franchise in cinema history. Some critics are saying it's one of the worst Bond films in the series and Craig's weakest outing, I think that is absolutely rubbish. It never reaches the emotional heights of Skyfall nor the perfectly paced Casino Royale, but there's still a ton of fun and surprises to be had here.Spectre, the infamous global criminal organization full of terrorism and world domination, is brought back to the franchise after roughly 40 years. Many hardcore fans may be upset by the direction they take that group and their leader but I think they handled it relatively well. That leader is played by the Oscar winner Christoph Waltz and wonderfully so, although criminally underused. I think that's one of the areas of Spectre that really bothered me. Skyfall was so focused and well strung together. Spectre tries to bring in too many elements and it doesn't all coalesce as much as it's predecessor. For example, MI6 is falling to shambles as there is hopes of creating a combined intelligence program between 9 different countries. I feel like this story line could have been cut down or out of the film and it could still be pretty much the same end product. It's nearly 2 and a half hours long, and there are times you feel the length. These scenes are definitely those times.With every Bond film you have the Bond girls/women. Léa Seydoux plays Mr. White's (from Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace) daughter and link to some of what Waltz's character is doing. The Daniel Craig films have handled the so called 'Bond girls' incredibly well. This was the first time in Craig's tenure that I felt they went the formulaic route with the women. With Seydoux and Monica Bellucci, I din't buy into why Bond would sleep with them, or rather why they would with him. It just didn't make sense story wise. With that said, Seydoux is very good, and for the most part handles herself without the need of 007.Bond did need some help taking down the Bond franchise staple, a villains henchman. This time it's Mr. Hinx, played by Dave Bautista. Hinx is a major highlight of Spectre as he shows shades of both Oddjob and Jaws, two of the best Bond villains of all time. With no dialogue and several incredible fight sequences, Bautista is right where he works best as an actor. He gave us yet another great train fight sequence, seems as though each of the best Bonds have one of those. Spectre takes plenty of twists and turns that may either upset or excite people. I was somewhere in the middle. I loved the tribute this film paid to plenty of other entries in the franchise, but I think there were plenty of missed chances as well. It contains one of my favorite pre-credits sequence of the series as Sam Mendes starts out with one impeccable long take for 4-5 minutes. The credits are also well handled and Sam Smith's song played better in the film than on YouTube for me, but the film doesn't really pick up until its final act. Make no mistake, it is one great final 40 minutes though. So in all, you get plenty to love for hardcore Bond fans, but I can understand a lot of the complaints this film has been getting.+Pre-credits sequence+Hinx+Some great action+Waltz+Seydoux -Missed opportunities-Formulaic at times-Uneven, slow middle act7.7/10Full video Review here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKvQZHhyfYg",7,3,10,6 November 2015
Joy," Can't Mop Up It's Own Mess
","Putting Jennifer Lawrence at the center of any film is always a good idea. Pretty much guaranteed a big profit and a great performance, especially when paired with frequent collaborator David O. Russell. Silver Linings Playbook is a great offbeat rom-com and American Hustle is an entertaining film even if it isn't nearly good enough to be an Oscar caliber film. So I figured Joy would just be the next step for this film duo, sadly I was mistaken.Joy tells the story of Joy Mangano, the creator of the miracle mop, and her rise to power alongside her family of four generations. Jennifer Lawrence plays Joy and does so well for the most part. Her accent is inconsistent but she's really the only character you care about throughout the film. Even Joy is unlikable at times. The rest of the cast is filled out with plenty of talent considering you have Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper (both O. Russell staples) in important roles. De Niro is very good and gives the film some of its rare funny moments. Cooper's significant role in act 2 takes the film in a much needed energetic direction but the rest of the film turns out to be rather dull.Lawrence's performance is enough to forgive some of the various issues. But there is one issue that continued to rise between Joy and her several obstacles in which everything seems to happen very easily. Not that she didn't work hard enough, but that the problems the movie brings up are resolved quickly and aren't handled with care. With no one likable and the conflicts being glossed over, Joy becomes yet another forgettable Oscar hopeful. +De Niro+Cooper is magnetic-Lawrence's accent is awful-No one is likable-Dry and dull story5.1/10",5,22,49,26 December 2015
Moon," Unpredictable ride with the great Sam Rockwell
","Sam Rockwell has been one of my favorite actors for a long time. He has showed his range from playing a villain in Iron Man 2 to the laid back somewhat role model in The Way Way Back to the obscure prison mate in The Green Mile. He just has great charisma on screen and it shows here in Moon. Not many actors have the ability to carry an entire movie by themselves. Kevin Spacey helps carry a conversation as the robot/computer Gerty.At first glance it seems this movie is an updated version of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It plays off as if the astronaut is being manipulated by the robot and eventually will fall at the 'hands' of the smarter robot. But this movie brings something different, and I'm glad that they didn't copy too much. Sam Bell (Rockwell) is at the end of his 3 year contract, and just wants to go home to see his family. Little does he know that the end of his contract will be the end of him.Halfway through the movie, you start to find out what's at stake here for Sam, or at least the Sam we know. I didn't know much about the story going in so I was pretty shocked at the whole clone aspect. I just thought it was more hallucinations. You also start to forget that Sam Rockwell isn't talking to another person while filming. The fact that he had to film both parts of him separately and make it work flawlessly is a tribute to how well its directed and acted. I really cant believe no Oscar wins or even nominations were given to this great achievement.I really don't have any complaints, other than maybe it could have longer. I wish they would have shown Sam walking among the people of earth, or maybe given us more to the story before he got there. Considering the reveals in the movie, I realize it would be tough to do more to the story beforehand, but possibly through flashbacks.This film is no doubt a great watch and I recommend to all. 8.4/10",8,1,3,19 March 2014
True Romance," Classic Tarantino
","True Romance is one of those movies that I've heard about for so many years and heard so many great things about, but never actually got around to seeing until now. In many ways, this is a classic Tarantino film. Albeit, it's only written by him and directed, it still feels like the same old obscurely charming tone that he brings to each of his films. At its heart, True Romance is a romance with a little bit of violence, luckily the incredibly talented cast and smartly written script, it's a whole lot more than that.I'd be wrong not to mention the amazing Hans Zimmer score that finally turned me on to the film. It's so simple, yet so cheerfully poignant, if that makes sense. Coming and going when needed, and always having a presence, it's truly one of Hans Zimmer's best, which is saying a lot. I had to get that out of the way because there's plenty more to get excited about with True Romance. Let's take the cast for example, which displays some of the greatest cameos in film history. Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Michael Rapaport, Bronson Pinchot, and Brad Pitt make up the main cast. But the supporting cast includes Dennis Hopper, James Gandolfini, Samuel L. Jackson, Christopher Walken, Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, and Gary Oldman make their presence felt for sure. I don't want to overstate it, but it may be the greatest ensemble of all time.It's not just that there's a lot of great actors though, everyone gets their chance to shine. Brad Pitt has a glorified cameo-role, but yet it's one of his more memorable roles. Gary Oldman is unrecognizable as Drexel, and also has a small part, but his big scene is easy one of the best in the film. Gandolfini, in a pre-Sopranos gig, proves to charismatic yet terrifying as a henchman for a crime boss. And who can forget Walken's iconic cameo as Vincenzo Coccotti, another person after Clarence and the cocaine he stole. Scene after scene, line after line, True Romance is one of the most quotable and re-watchable films ever made.Granted, after one viewing I'm over-hyping it a bit. There are some undeniable issues with True Romance, like how everything happens so easily for Clarence. There are some consequences for his character here and there, but for the most part, he gets away with what he wants and it all comes very easily for a guy who was just presented to be a nerd from Detroit. I also don't feel like the ending completely wraps up what it needs to. In classic Tarantino fashion, things happen really fast and in a chaotic and unexpected nature, therefore leaving a few strings loose in the end. Seemingly leaving the door open for a sequel, which never came.In all though, True Romance is a film that is as enjoyable to watch as it probably was to film. Everything was hitting on all cylinders, and it became a classic many years later for it. 8.4/10",8,4,5,12 September 2017
Her," A Near Perfect Film About Love
","'Her' is the type of film that comes off so strange and distant to most people that it wont be seen by many. But perhaps years down the line we find that this film sheds light on the ugly truths about where we are headed socially. Even though the movie is suppose to take place about a decade down the line, I find this whole story to be relatable for most everyone. We use technology so much now we have almost developed relationships with it. It's perfectly written and directed by Spike Jonze. He did a great job building this world visually and even threw in subtle hints at how we really communicate with people now and possibly in the future. When Joaquin Phoenix walks around the city you barely ever see people communicating with others, and quite often it's through a device. I think this movie is one of the best romantic films of our generation and years down the line will be considered a classic.I had worries that this film would steer down the creepy tunnel too much for my liking, but really there were only two scenes that made me uncomfortable. I think at times Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) was made to be a little bit unlikable, but even then the next scene made me really want the couple to stay together. But because I am a human, and like other humans, I want to see an actual relationship on screen. That's why I loved when Spike Jonze would sprinkle in other characters to help move the story along. Every one of the supporting characters did their job and were not overused.Amy Adams was fantastic as Theodore's long friend who shared the love of these OS systems. Chris Pratt was funny but did at times feel a little off because of the darker tone the rest of the movie was. And even in her small and unlikable role Rooney Mara was great. Like I said it's a thought provoking and overall enjoyable film about where we might be headed. I appreciate this completely unique take on romance, and look forward to further projects involving Spike Jonze.+Unique and interesting romance+Supporting cast was flawless+Writing was on point in every scene-As a human, I'm rooting for the human over the OS9.6/10",9,0,3,30 May 2014
The Nice Guys," Bring on Sequels
","I don't know how much broad appeal a period piece that's structured around an adult film industry crime has, but you'll have a hard time not getting behind the chemistry between Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling as the title characters. The Nice Guys is undoubtedly one of the most entertaining films from beginning to end in 2016 with a refreshing take on the buddy-cop genre.Crowe plays Jackson Healy, a tough, uncompromising, and rugged private eye of sorts who is looking for the same young woman who Gosling is as well. Gosling plays against type as Holland March who is everything Healy is not as he pretty much weeps at the sight of blood. The two play wonderfully off each other in what is hopefully just the first time we see them on screen together. It appears as if some of the gags between the two of them is improvised, but Shane Black's script and direction deserves a ton of credit.If it does well enough at the box office, I have to believe the audience would be open to sequels. Black not only establishes the bond between Healy and March, but he also sets up the characters individually just as well. The subtle hints at who they were before this movie added the needed depth for the story and motivations from both sides. With that said, the heavy inclusion of March's daughter, Holly, doesn't work as well as I think Shane Black hoped. I didn't have any problems with Angourie Rice's performance, but her presence sometimes overshadows the brilliant dynamic established with Healy and March. Seeing a 13-year-old girl parade around adult film parties filled with gunfire can be quite amusing at times, but it's more uncomfortable than anything else.It's worth mentioning that Kim Basinger re-teams with her L.A. Confidential co-star, Crowe, so that was neat. In all, I really love the world Shane Black created with The Nice Guys. There's something to be said for a period piece that poses a smart and entertaining time at the movies all while amping up my excitement for sequels.+Chemistry between Crowe and Gosling+Intricate and funny script+Sets itself up for installments in the future-Focus shifts to the daughter a few too many times9.1/10",9,8,18,20 May 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Road of Redemption
","I really want to go back and watch Road Warrior now that I've seen Fury Road. The first Mad Max was a fantastic revenge story that also gave us some of the best low budget action we have ever had. Road Warrior to me fell short of the first and just didn't give me that visceral experience. But I'm definitely willing to give it another shot after seeing the insane Fury Road. Now, you don't necessarily have to see any of the first 3 to understand the world of Mad Max, but you will have a better appreciation for what exactly is going on in this post apocalyptic world. It's cleared up by Tom Hardy in the first few minutes of the movie, which shows flashbacks, or recreations rather, from the events of the first two films. Bottom line is to go see this movie in theaters. It's the best pure action film of the year and of quite some time.We begin at the Citadel, when presumably the world and it's chaos is controlled by King Immortan Joe. He has 5 wives who were individually selected for breeding and carrying on his blood, who are held hostage at his place. Furiosa, played by Charlize Theron, isn't thrilled and decides to steal all of his wives and bring them to her homeland, the Green Place. While in pursuit, she crosses paths with the once captured Mad Max, and they agree begrudgingly to help each other for their own greater good. What follows is an insane action film that barely takes time to breathe. 90% of the film is supposedly practical effects, which is absolutely mind-blowing. I love Avengers, but half of the film is green screen, and you can pretty much tell when it is. But here, watching the film, I couldn't really tell you what parts were real and what wasn't. And at 70 years old, George Miller did an unbelievable job, especially considering some of the development problems the film had. There are people jumping from vehicle to vehicle, riding their motorcycles on top of huge trucks, hanging onto the bottom of high speed car chases, and almost all of it was real. It gives you an extra layer of excitement while watching the film that you just don't get with CGI fest films.With that being said, the action never becomes overpowering or distracting. It doesn't necessarily exhaust you, it just thrills you. Especially with Junkie XL's brilliant score playing in the background. Sure, I definitely would have liked to have seen more development from the characters, especially our main villain. Besides having several wives and controlling the water supply, we don't know much about him. Mad Max just gets stuck in the chaos, it's not even really his film. It's really Furiosa's film and wow is she an awesome bada** character or what? Side note: I would love to see some sort of team up between Furiosa and Rita Vrataski from Edge of Tomorrow (AKA Full Metal Bitc*). Charlize Theron strips down her glamorous Hollywood look for the role and gives a terrific performance. I found a lot of her back-story to be really touching and even heartbreaking. As much as it's a story of redemption for her, it's a redemption film for the Mad Max franchise, which will hopefully continue. This can easily be a new set of films with Hardy and the supporting roles, which it's worth mentioning how great and unrecognizable Nicholas Hoult was in the film. This film has so many great action scenes, with characters you root for and even some deeper themes about surviving madness and how you control chaos. Even though I loved the trailers, I was deeply surprised by Mad Max: Fury Road, and I hope to see more of these films.+Furiosa is an awesome character +Hardy is as good if not better than Gibson +Insane action, how did they do it? +Sets up a new set of films, but honors the ones before +Unrecognizable Hoult +Action doesn't get exhausting +Junkie XL's score -Character development 9.5/10",9,8,16,15 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," A Remarkable Story
","Putting aside his personal life, Mel Gibson is a great director & has a knack for big scope pictures based on true stories. Now is Hacksaw Ridge the next great thing from the infamous director? Maybe, maybe not.As I say about a lot of genres these days, we don't get a lot of great war films. We just don't. Free State of Jones, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and even 13 Hours haven't been great. But I was hoping Hacksaw Ridge would reinvigorate the genre, and perhaps reinvent it. To a certain extent, it does. A story about a Seventh-day Adventist who wants to join the army as a conscientious objector makes for a different way of telling a World War II story.I think the problem here is that the first and second halves of this story feel like two completely different films altogether. The first mainly deals with Desmond Doss' (Andrew Garfield) budding romance with Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer) back at his hometown of Lynchburg, Virgina. I really bought into the cuteness and sincerity of that relationship, but it gets lost entirely in the second half. I think I would have preferred more of a balance between a straight romance story and a straight war film. And not a split down the halfway mark of the film, I mean each aspect sprinkling into each other.I can't deny how impressive Gibson's ability to direct intense battle sequences is, however. Braveheart has one of the most beautifully shot finales of all time, and there's plenty of that to go around in the battle sequences here. The fact that Doss' beliefs prevented him from being able to pick up any sort of weapon and he managed to save over 70 men during the Battle of Okinawa. The story is remarkable and watching Doss relentlessly saving one person after another when everyone else had left, is definitely inspiring. But I think the rush of it all overwhelmed my enjoyment of the battle, considering the first half is a different film entirely.Vince Vaughn, Hugo Weaving, and Rachel Griffiths round out the cast nicely and add other levels of emotion to an already fascinating story. But if I had to change something, it would be the pacing and direction from Gibson. If Gibson could have found a way to sprinkle in romantic scenes to the unsettling battle or the other way around, the film would have been more fluid and even. Other than that, this is definitely a film worth seeing in theaters just for the remarkable performance of Garfield alone.+Cute romance+Comradery at the Army base+Performances all around-Uneven direction, pacing7.5/10",7,2,10,12 November 2016
Warcraft," The War is Just Beginning
","Flushed with astounding CGI and epic scale fights, Warcraft is the next big blockbuster of 2016 that will wow viewers with its flare. Unfortunately, its messy plot and questionable character choices drown what could have been the next great Fantasy flick.Initially the largely CGI/green screen world building had me hesitant after seeing 2014's Hobbit installment, but that's not at all the problem here. The motion capture of the orcs and colorful landscapes that director Duncan Jones displays may very well be the best thing about Warcraft. The story centers around the orcs arrival in a human world and the inability for the two to coexist. Surprisingly, I found myself more emotionally connected to the orcs, and in particular, Durotan.Toby Kebbell isn't new to mo-cap. He burst onto the scene in 2014 as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and his performance in Warcraft proved to be just as impressive. Durotan is one of the few orcs who saw the need for the humans and orcs to work together against the all too powerful, Gul'dan. His arc didn't necessarily go the route I had hoped, but it was the part of the film I felt most invested with.On the other side of things, the humans, led by King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) were far less interesting. Not only is not enough time taken to explore the depths of each of the main humans, but the story is taken in a frustratingly predictable route. In order for me to feel the weight of an emotional scene, there has to be enough character depth set up, Warcraft fails to do that on numerous occasions.What Warcraft does have going for it is promise. While I wasn't all that invested in the story they were trying to tell, I see potential for future films taking a more daring approach to the battle between orcs and humans. Shave off the confusing lore of Warcraft that seemed shoved into the first act and balance mind-blowing action with intriguing character drama. Even if this wasn't Duncan Jones at his best, I believe there was a good film here somewhere. There seemed to be quite a few missing scenes or background information that could have been helpful with a longer cut. Hopefully, that cut will see the light of day.+Great CGI+Kebbell's mo-cap performance-Didn't feel emotionally invested-Missing scenes and confusing lore make for a messy-feeling plot-Could have been more daring, less derivative5.5/10",5,4,9,12 June 2016
Me Before You," Live Boldly
","I wouldn't consider myself the target audience for these romantic dramas. In fact, I'm usually turned off by the overabundance of forced clichés and unnecessary plot devices. While Me Before You definitely falls victim to some of those unfortunate young adult tropes, there's far more charm than harm here. The film stars Emilia Clarke (Lou) and Sam Claflin (Will) from Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games respectively. I've enjoyed both of their works in the past and they both make the most of the script that was given to them. Their budding charisma on screen is by far the highlight of the film. It's nice to see Clarke take on a lighter and more exuberant role than she has played in the past as it mirrors her off-screen personality as well. Clarke's likability as Lou is put a test as she has to deal with the stern and far less cheerful, Will, who became paralyzed after a motorcycle accident. If you didn't guess it already, yes they do grow to live with each other's quirks and inconveniences and maybe even share some affection for each other. It's pretty much the basis for all of these romantic novels adapted for film, but if you're film has enough likable qualities to it, the overused plot points and clichés can be forgiven.The main qualm for these characters are Will's questionable wishes about his future living as a quadriplegic and Lou's inability to fulfill her potential and aspirations due to her commitment as the breadwinner for her family. The way Lou effortlessly deals with these issues is what makes her so likable. It's also why you root for her and Will to become romantically involved as the film gives us compelling enough reasons to desire it. With that said, I was pleasantly surprised with how the romance is depicted. Everything is earned and not forced.I think my only real complaints with the film involve its tendency to veer into clichéd territory. I'm not a fan of when romantic films play popular songs that tell you exactly how to feel as an audience member. Or when a certain character is written specifically to give us someone to dislike and is used a plot device more than anything else. On more than one occasion, Me Before You does that. But it's when the film attempts to take an original and realistic spin on the romance that the film really shines. It's because of the ladder that I think Me Before You is definitely worth a look.+Clarke's undeniable likability+Charm and chemistry with the Lou and Will dynamic+Romance is earned not forced-Popular songs tend to ruin the big moments-A few clichéd characters and plot devices7.4/10",7,52,81,4 June 2016
Contact," Sometimes Cerebral, Sometimes Silly. Ultimately, It's a Missed Opportunity
","With all the fun popcorn sci-fi movies we get each year, I think people forget how interesting and cerebral science-fiction can be. Contact is an ambitious look at the lengths of our universe and our human reach, but it sometimes gets a little too obsessed with itself to make a great watch.Directed by the great Robert Zemeckis and stars Oscar winning Jodie Foster as Dr. Arroway, a scientist who first discovers a potential connection to a life form from an unidentifiable place. Contact is mostly a film about a young girl devoting her life to the research and passion of her late father, but it deals with some heavy themes and ideas. Some ideas are perhaps way to grand scale and broad for the film's grasp, but at its core I really dug the bond between a father and his daughter here. David Morse plays her father in a limited role, but his presence is felt throughout the film.Jodie Foster's performance as Dr. Arroway is also a highlight. As much as it appears this is an ensemble piece with established actors, this film is largely on her shoulders, and she always kept me engaged. Unfortunately, her character is given a love interest in Matthew McConaughey's character, Palmer Joss. It's one thing to have a one- note character as a love interest. But it's even worse to have that very character ONLY be used when the plot feels like it needs the audience to be more invested in an 'emotional moment'. The Joss character is merely a plot device and is a hindrance on the enjoyment of Contact as a whole.But Joss wasn't the only highly flawed character. As Arroway gets closer to analyzing the 'aliens' message to the humans, a character named S.R. Hadden secretly meets with Arroway. This scene, along with every scene he appears in, is completely tonally out of place. This is Contact's biggest issue. The film's first half is tonally balanced and grounded in realism (at least for sci-fi), but once Hadden enters the picture it feels much more heightened than it does grounded. His character seems like a villain straight out of a Bond film, and that just didn't fit in with the rest of the story.I like what this film challenges us to think about and explore. And to its credit, the third act's payoff is truly unlike anything I have seen before, so there's no shortage of originality there. But to me, the writing with a few characters and unbalanced tone is what really killed my enjoyment after awhile.+Foster+Harrowing journey full of intriguing reveals-But the tone is all over the place-As are the writing for certain characters6.6/10",6,0,0,9 November 2016
Donnie Darko," Giving Into Fear
","It's films like these that make me love cinema. I know I say that a lot, but it's worth mentioning how movies like Donnie Darko give me a unique feeling. It's hard to explain, but much like Mulholland Drive, I wanted to look up more about the film after I watched it. It's not a film that allows you to go back to your normal life before you sit down and think about what you just saw. I cant believe I hadn't watched the movie until now, but I'm also jealous of people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that transcends the screen and becomes more than just something you watched, it's something you experienced.It's 2015 and Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top actors in the world, but way back in 2001 that wasn't the case. In fact, Donnie Darko was one of the first movies to showcase what he had to offer. I will still maintain that the most impressive thing Gyllenhaal does is create a character with his eyes. Everything goes through his subtle eye movements and gestures. Take a look back at his performance in Nightcrawler or Prisoners and analyze how much his eyes define his character. He may very well be the best actor working today. As Donnie, he was able to showcase just how good he can be at nailing a character with inner demons. None more terrifying than Frank, the strange rabbit who appears frequently throughout Donnie's dreams. More importantly, Jake gives us a character who you sympathize with even after all of the horrible things he has done. Not many people can say that.For most of the film, it's hard to figure out just what is going on. Not just because of the huge cast and seemingly several important characters to the plot, but because the film juggles many different genres all in one. It's a psychological thriller at heart, but mixed in is sci-fi, horror, crime, and even a little bit of romance. It's actually probably because of those many genres that I feel the films main weaknesses derive from. The tone is shifting a lot throughout the film and the music constantly switches from being a 90's high school angst film to a dark twisted psychological mystery film a lot.But overall it's a really good film. The phrase 'keeps you on the edge of your seat' can be considered an understatement for Darko. The two hours sped by and I honestly didn't want it to end. Even after the twisted ending, I wanted to see where these characters went. Speaking of characters, it's worth mentioning how good all of the other actors are here. Maggie Gyllenhaal, playing Donnie's sister, looks just about as stunning as she's ever been, and is also pretty darn good in the role too. Jena Malone in one of her first major roles definitely carries her own weight as the lead female and love interest to Donnie. But Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Mary McDonnell all make their presence felt here.So of course, then comes the question of what my opinion is on the ending of the film. While in some senses it's ambiguous, I don't think it's beyond belief to think that the ending was meticulously crafted in order for us to debate for years to come. I've done my research and am satisfied with what I believe to be the fate of all the characters. But one of the biggest takeaways from the film I found was the inspiration the film seemed to take from David Lynch. Even though Mulholland Drive came out the same year, it really seemed to take a whole lot from that type of storytelling. If you told me Lynch directed Donnie Darko I would have believed you. But anyway, Donnie Darko is on it's own one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time, and definitely one of Gyllenhaal's best films.+Gyllenhaal's performance through his eyes +Great cast +Unique +Ending that takes some time to process -Genre mixing can be exhausting at times 9.0/10",9,2,4,28 August 2015
Macbeth," What's Done is Done
","Justin Kurzel's fresh take on the classic Shakespeare drama boasts two breathtakingly good performances from Cotillard and Fassbender, which is more than enough to overcome the unnecessarily flamboyant direction.For someone who isn't at all into any of Shakespeare's classic tales, I was intrigued with this project for merely two reasons; Marion Cotillard and Michael Fassbender. Not only was I enthralled by both of their turns, but I enjoyed the different take on a story that has been redone so many times. Kurzel chose to take a much more visceral and experimental approach with the storytelling, and for the most part, it works. It took me awhile before I became accustomed to Kurzel's style, but it proved to create more of an emotional backbone to what is already a heavy story.Fassbender, who has found such a nice balance in starring in blockbusters and indies, gives another astounding performance as the troubled title character. He effortlessly demonstrates Macbeth's confidence while also adding in vulnerability to his paranoia. If marketed more, this could have been another nomination for Fassbender. On the other-hand, Cotillard also had her hands full with the meaty role of Lady Macbeth, but she holds her own with Fassbender, constantly nailing the difficult Shakespearean dialogue.As previously mentioned, you do feel a strong presence of Kurzel's visual flare here and I think there is valid argument to make that it tarnishes some aspects of the story. For the first 30 minutes or so, the choppy editing and strange visual cues Kurzel uses didn't enhance my viewing experience. It wasn't really until I dug my teeth into this particular interpretation of these characters that I began to care for the stylistic storytelling.Overall, it's not a usual adaption but nor is it one that I would want to sit through more than once. It is, however, a visceral experience (unlike many Shakespeare adaptations) led by two Oscar caliber performances.+Cotillard and Fassbender are powerful+Kurzel's style grew on me-Takes time to get going7.8/10",7,2,4,7 August 2016
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Vastly Entertaining Way to End the Trilogy
","When it comes to the most iconic film characters of all time, Indiana Jones is near the top of that list. The amount of unbelievable journeys he has gone on has been unparalleled to say the least. The Last Crusade just adds to the fun with Sean Connery portraying Indi's father. Raiders did a great job in establishing this laid back tone with glimpses of darkness along the way. Where as Temple of Doom in my opinion steered away from the tone of the franchise and never seemed to capture my attention as much as the book ends did. It's very hard at this point to pick which out of the two i liked more, but the franchise is most definitely cemented as one of the greatest of all time.Out of the three The Last Crusade has the most action and the pacing is brilliant. You get a 15-20 scene of chases and adventure and then 10-15 minute of key dialog in the over all story. Much like Big Fish and About Time this film is an adventure film with plenty of mystery, but when it comes down to it, its a story about father and son reconnecting. The story is heartfelt and some of the better acting both Connery and Ford have done. When you get two actors of their caliber you can count on that they will deliver the performances needed to sell this bond between father and son. The film is on the shoulders of those two, and they carried this classic to the very end.It also helps when a movie actually makes you believe the leads are in true danger. With huge franchises it is often tough to sell the audience into thinking our favorite character may actually die, but this film did that. But i can say this film is not without it's problems. While Raiders was special because of the villain, Crusade wasn't anything too spectacular. A villain needs a good back story and motivation to do the things they do. I didn't feel at all intrigued by the Nazi leader. It was just great to see Indi kick his butt in the end. Ford is a movie star so i cant say it wouldn't be great to see him back in the role one day but that time has likely past. They have big shoes to fill but the fan favorites Chris Pratt or Bradley Cooper would do the role justice.+Non stop entertainment+Father-Son duo+Belief that our characters are at risk+Beautifully paced-Weak villain8.5/10",8,3,5,21 September 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Vulnerable But Vengeful Bourne
","Supremacy builds on all the strengths of 2002's 'Identity' by giving Jason Bourne a much more relatable and grounded side. It's far from risky or overly original, but The Bourne Supremacy is as tightly compacted and impeccably directed as a spy thriller can get.Stepping in for Doug Liman is Paul Greengrass, known now as a master of suspense films, and Supremacy was one of his first gems. As I've said before, the original Bourne trilogy gets better with each film, and I think this second entry in the spy series may give us the best performance from Matt Damon in the title role. With his increasingly likable performance and magnetic charm, along with Tony Gilroy's well strung script, Supremacy tends to hit on all levels.With a bigger budget and seemingly more freedom in that department, I feel like the filmmakers wanted to turn the series in a slightly more action heavy route. Instead of Bourne being on the run from the C.I.A., this time he's hunting them, and the action steps up because of that. Bourne has more time to plan out his moves and hence the scenes feeling more natural and polished. With that said, the reason the action works so well, is because the characters are written with depth and motivations. There are no mustache twirling villains, you understand where everyone is coming from, even if you don't agree with their decisions.One of those nicely written characters is Joan Allen's Pamela Landy. Landy, a new task force leader from the C.I.A., wants just as many answers as Bourne as she draws close to the truth behind Treadstone. Unfortunately for her, Bourne is after everyone who ever wronged him, and Landy may be one of them. Much like the first film, as the audience you suspect what's going on, but it's far more interesting to watch the performances and reactions of the characters finding out themselves. That's a tribute to the acting and directing.At the center of each Bourne film is the performance of the great Matt Damon, and I don't know that he's ever been as good as he is in 'Supremacy'. The wide range of emotion and flawless action sequences that he (reportedly) did stunts for is impressive. The best Bourne is revenge Bourne and that's what we get here. It's always entertaining to watch him rip apart the C.I.A.'s attempts to take him down, even on the 5th or 6th viewing.+Damon has never been better+Joan Allen+Amped up action, amped up characters+Vulnerable but vengeful Bourne9.4/10",9,2,3,27 July 2016
13 Hours," Wartime Horrors
","Michael Bay needs to stop making Transformers films. Pearl Harbor was definitely a mess at times, but it's films like 13 Hours that Bay should focus on. You can tell how passionate Bay is for these stories and our heroes overseas. There is still plenty of Bay-isms throughout 13 Hours, but for the most part, it's a well made film with more heart and emotion than any of his last handful of films combined.An important difference between this film and other Bay films is that it feels like he left all of the script duties to other people. There aren't any gratuitous shots of women and there were minimal slow motion action shots. Granted, some of those slow motion shots were substituted for the highly overused hand-held camera work, otherwise known as 'shaky cam'. Seriously Hollywood, can we stop that? But Bay pulled back on the action and created a really scary and realistic world in Libya. This tells the story of the Benghazi soldiers who were thrust into helping an entire undercover base when chaos ensues. An important thing Bay does is create an atmosphere that is clearly layered with people who don't understand what's going on and why it's happening. It's those choices by Bay that give the film its depth in its quieter moments. Yep, Bay actually developed his characters relatively well, something those Transformers films never really accomplished.The film does however try to pull on your heartstrings a little too much at times, including showing all of the soldiers at the same time contacting their families and friends a mere day before the attacks. A little more subtly would have helped, Bay. With that said, you absolutely end up caring about the characters involved in these attacks, and Bay even shows the Libyans who helped the U.S. when our 'friendlies' weren't available, a nice touch for a Hollywood film.Another complaint I had was that sometimes the tone of the film shifts from being darkly serious to a little too playful when characters start cracking a few jokes during intense battle sequences. I would have liked a little more consistency.A character describes the events of the film towards the end as 'feeling like he's in a horror film'. I can't disagree with him. There were moments of tension and terror of 13 Hours that surpassed some horror films of the past few years, that can also be contributed to Bay's work. Last but not least, I'd like to give a shout-out to Lorne Balfe who composed the music. The score complemented the film well, especially in its most heartfelt and heartbreaking moments. A job well done Bay and crew, 13 Hours is a solid film.+Well developed story and characters+Incredible score+Tension and horrifying moments-A little more subtly in big moments would have been nice-Tone shifts a bit here and there-Shaky cam7.0/10",7,1,11,17 January 2016
The Birds," Intense and Obscurely Frightening
","The master of suspense directed one of the most strangely terrifying films ever made. It revolves around random bird attacks on a bay near San Francisco when a woman decides to spend a few days there. The reason or motive behind these attacks is unknown but the birds show absolutely no remorse.Hitchcock was always great at giving us incredible female leads, and Tippi Hedren's 'Melanie Daniels was no different. You don't even find out a lot about her character, only that she is determined to bring the two love birds to Mitch, a recently stranger turned friend. The film alludes to the fact that the attacks only begin once she arrives on site. But even then we don't truly know the motive behind it all. I didn't find the supporting performances to be all that great, in fact i found the mothers to be a bit revolting at times. The children were also at times obnoxious.The first hour of the film is very calm and reminiscent of a Hitchcock romance but when the attacks begin, they don't let up. The scene at the schoolhouse is iconic and is impossible to remove from your mind. The way Hitchcock shows Melanie's point of view all the way to the hundreds of crows just waiting to attack was marvelous. In what started as a soothing first hour, ends with a terrifying last 50 minutes. Much like every fantasy like story, most people don't believe the attacks are real until they eventually witness the downtown explosions with several people dying. It's then we see one of our favorite characters die and basically all hell breaks loose.Hitchcock did a brilliant job directing the film but i can't quite grip my head around his choice for an ambiguous ending. Usually you take this time to offer either a twist or a huge reveal that alters the viewing experience and pieces the puzzle together. Instead we are left with no answers. Overall, there are several classic moments but the sum of it's parts didn't pay off as much as i would have liked.+Strong Hitchcock female lead+Frightening built up horror+Iconic school scene-Weak supporting characters-Ending7.6/10",7,1,4,23 September 2014
Sully," Power of the Human Spirit
","If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it's directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.'The miracle on the Hudson' is the subject of this Eastwood drama, starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom Hanks. Having wonderfully played another 'controversial' captain back in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking that can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knows exactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100",9,171,215,9 September 2016
Princess Mononoke," Fascinating Mythology
","A visceral story from the brilliant mind of Hayao Miyazaki, Princess Mononoke is a joyous ride through the eyes of Ashitaka, a brave warrior who finds himself caught in the crossfire of relentless humans and vicious creatures of the forest.Speaking of relentless, even at over 2 hours long, this film flies by with brisk pacing and gorgeous animation by Studio Ghibli. For an animation film, the runtime is unusually long, but the epic scope and beautiful storytelling transcend typical animations. One of my first thoughts while watching was how good this story could be in live- action form. Even if it's a television series, the lore calls for this to be adapted into live-action.The mythology is incredibly well-realized and thought out as well. Each of the several sides to this ongoing battle against the forest have reason for fighting. Yes, Ashitaka is the protagonist, but I wasn't necessarily rooting for any particular side to win. That's when you know the characters have plenty of depth. My only real complaint here is that sometimes the dialogue comes out a bit dull and lacks the gravitas that the very scene calls for. Of course, this may only be in the English dubbed version that I watched, or the script. Either way, the story is brilliant, but the dialogue just didn't match it.Above everything else, Princess Mononoke is a special film. It transcends the usual tropes of animated films by being a viscerally graphic war film with plenty of heart and thought provoking ideas. It's no surprise this is praised as one of Miyazaki's very best films.+So different than any animated film+Meaningful violence+Interesting mythology+All characters have depth87/100",8,1,2,16 September 2016
Beetlejuice," Dare You Say It Three Times
","Beetlejuice is mostly a product of the 1980's, but there's something about Tim Burton's flare for the absolute absurd supernatural that gives this film an incomparable likability.Burton teamed up with his early career favorite Michael Keaton for the title character, and in turn created what is perhaps one of the most iconic performances of all time. Beetlejuice has Burton's prints all over it on its own, but with Keaton's performance, it's classic Burton. With that said, I don't know that the film survives if you aren't keen on the overbearing style of Burton. I like his movies as much as the next guy (Big Fish is in my top 5 favorite films of all time), but besides Keaton, there isn't a whole lot to ride home about here.Beetlejuice has had fans clamoring for a sequel for decades, and I'm not going to be the one to shut those hopes down. With the talented cast, especially where they all are in their careers now, a sequel could be interesting. But I never found Geena Davis or Alec Baldwin's characters to be all that interesting. As they weave their way through the weirdness of the world of death, the film just veers more into a meandering area.With all the dated elements to Burton's execution, the real gems of this film come from his unique vision. If you were to walk in on this film at any particular moment, you would be able to tell that it's a Burton project, and there's something special about that. I can appreciate a unique vision, but I just wanted more of an overarching journey than a collage of creepy and just strange sequences.+Burton's style+Keaton's iconic performance-Hodgepodge of strange scenes-Supporting characters aren't that interesting6.6/10",6,0,1,15 August 2016
Alien: Covenant," Run.
","After a week worth of Alien films, I think I'm about ready to take a break from the trapped in space sub-genre for a bit. Alien: Covenant has its moments, and is certainly miles above the 3rd or 4th film, but struggles with the same problems as Prometheus, trying to juggle too many things at once.Although Ridley Scott returned to the series with Prometheus, Covenant is more of an official return to the beloved face-hugger franchise. As I said with Prometheus, Alien: Covenant is truly an awe to look at. Every frame is oozing with gorgeous cinematography and stunning production design. Scott's direction is still uneven like in Prometheus, as he still hasn't decided whether he wants to make a slasher/horror film or a philosophical science fiction piece. However, there's no denying that this film is his vision, and I can always appreciate movies that are able to supersede the wants and needs of a major studio.With that said, I really wish Covenant was more than just a solid monster film. There's nothing overwhelmingly different or surprising about Covenant. It's just your prototypical monster film where a crew go somewhere they're not familiar with, meet dangerous creatures, and get attacked by said dangerous creatures. I just feel like Alien & Aliens had so much more underneath the surface. You cared about the characters in those movies, and that's not the case at all here. I can't say I cared about a single one of the humans aboard Covenant.I guess it's not entirely fair to say Alien: Covenant doesn't add anything to the series because there is plenty of proposed ideas that Covenant continues from Prometheus, it's just that those ideas don't feel like they belong in this particular adventure. I like that David, one of the two characters Michael Fassbender plays, is obsessed with creation and becoming more than just an android. I think that angle of this story is fascinating, and it plays out in a rather terrifyingly dark way, but I'm not sure how well it meshes with the rest of the film. In fact, his disturbing presence tends to overshadow the Xenomorphs for a good portion of the film. I don't think I should come out of an Alien film raving about how disturbing an android was instead of the two-mouthed face huggers themselves.There are plenty of thrills to have with Covenant and the film is about as beautiful to look at as any, but if we're talking about it compared to the rest of the series? It really doesn't hold a candle. Hopefully the sequel can build on the lore and give us a more terrifying and surprising experience than Covenant did.+Another gorgeously shot Ridley Scott film+Proposed ideas-But not everything always comes together nicely-Nothing is shocking or surprising7.1/10",7,3,13,20 May 2017
All the President's Men," Fascinating Execution
","Even if the story of Watergate itself wasn't as interesting as it is, this film would probably be just as good. All the President's Men is a fascinating portrait of how two men took down a president. But more importantly, it really captures the chaotic life of an investigative journalist. The story is obviously devastating for many people across America, but by far the best part about this film is watching the events unfold in a unique way through Alan Pukula's directing. So much of films now in days take and are inspired from this movie.Centered around Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, who were for all intents and purposes two of the most important men in the history of American journalism, but also ironically some of the only people who dared even go near the Watergate Scandal. The film can get confusing sometimes with all the dozens of names that are thrown around and who's working for who or who is telling the truth, but that's why the film works. Not only does it keep you on the edge of your seat even when we all know the ending, but you find yourself raising your eyebrows at events that seem absolutely unreasonable.It won the Oscar for best screenplay which is fine, but I think it's a crime Pukula didn't win for directing. I think Pukula took what is probably a great book, and enhanced it significantly. The screenplay is solid, but it's the camera angles, editing, and acting that take the film to the next level. It's a rare film in which I'm more interested in how it was made over the actual story the film is based on.Aside from the great technical aspects, it's interesting to watch Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford's performances change over the course of the film. Hoffman is evidently more aggressive than Redord, but as the story takes it's many turns and tensions arise, the roles are reversed. As a writer myself, it was just very interesting to watch the tactics each writer used in order to get information. All the President's Men has a great story, performances, and many other things, but I was most impressed with the technical side of this film.+Directing+Camera angles, long takes+Role reversal with the two writers8.5/10",8,2,2,19 November 2015
The Martian," Bring Him Home
","After the past two years with Gravity and Interstellar coming out, two of the greatest sci-films in history in my opinion, I was eagerly awaiting the next huge space sci-fi epic. Along comes The Martian with one of the best ensembles of the year and a sci-fi genius in Ridley Scott directing. A story about a man stranded on Mars after his crew assumed he was dead and you get Matt Damon to play the lead? Count me in. The verdict? I really liked The Martian. It's really funny, highly entertaining, and beautiful to look at, but I wasn't blown away.Matt Damon is more than worth the price of admission. For most of the film, he has pretty much no one to act off of, which is something I think people are overlooking. The ensemble back home and his crew on their way back carry a load of screen-time, but this is Matt Damon's movie. Whether it's Chiwetel Ejiofor, Jeff Daniels, Sean Bean, Jessica Chastain, or Michael Pena, the cast is on top of their game. I think where the film lacks is surprisingly its directing. I know it's based on a book, but there were plenty of scenes that I wish lasted longer but were short and vice versa. That's the case especially toward the end when I'm supposed to feel a rush of emotion, instead I felt letdown that I didn't get to see more of a scene. But the film does a great job of bringing to life scenes that should seem boring and dry. For example, all of the scientific centered exposition never feels overwhelming. That can be contributed to Ridley Scott's directing and Matt Damon's likability as an actor. That's one of the things The Martian does extremely well, it's really well paced in terms of entertainment level. You don't feel the length.So perhaps it's more of editing issues instead of Scott's actual directing I had a problem with. Another thing that let me down was how little Damon's crew was in the film. That dynamic between all of them could have been explored whether it be flashbacks or just through the NASA message system. Especially when you have people like Jessica Chastain, it just seemed like a bit of a missed opportunity. No matter, The Martian still should most definitely be seen on the big screen. The Mars scenes alone are visually breathtaking. I don't know how much is green screen but I felt like I was on another planet. In terms of the special effects and CG, iv'e seen better. Again, we have been spoiled with space in film so I can acknowledge this film looks great. It just doesn't hold a candle to Interstellar or Gravity. But it's hard to pick apart this film. There really isn't much wrong with it, it just didn't blow me away like it did for others in the film community.+Damon's Oscar worthy performance+Mars has never looked better+Humor+Ensemble-Underused supporting crew though-CG has been better8.3/10",8,3,64,1 October 2015
Atonement," Perceptions
","Sometimes there are films that present a story in such a way that it makes you rethink the entire film after the first watch. Not that I didn't know what to expect with Atonement, considering I did read the synopsis before viewing, but there's something so incredibly impactful about the way Joe Wright adapts the acclaimed novel. You never exactly know the final direction until the last moments of pure devastation. And that's what I call an affective film.It's not just Wright's direction however, as there's absolutely magnetic performances to dive deep into including one from the young Saoirse Ronan. Ronan plays Briony Tallis, who blames a serious crime on her sister's boyfriend because of her clouded judgement. It's an unfortunate tale of a person bringing their previous beliefs of a person into a judgement call that is far beyond their understanding, especially for someone who is only 13 years old. The other notable thing about Atonement is the original score. The way Dario Marianelli factors in a typewriter to his already beautiful piano score is meticulously unique. It really adds an extra element to a deep film in its own right. It's also gorgeous film to look at, especially the long shots of the Dunkirk beach and the costume/production design throughout. And really, the film is a gorgeous tragedy, something that in order to be effective, has to be directed with extreme care and an original touch. Atonement is all of these things and more.8.8/10",8,0,0,4 April 2018
V for Vendetta," Ideas Are Bulletproof
","I have always liked the concept of an idea living on past one person or even an event. I think it's fascinating to think about how one idea can shape an entire race or population. It was tackled in The Dark Knight Trilogy as it was here in V For Vendetta. While I think this film does a brilliant job at portraying that idea, I don't think the film itself is quite as good as it's made out to be.It's based on a graphic novel of the same name published by Vertigo and DC comics written by Alan Moore. I hear it's a great read so perhaps I will one day give a try, but I cant help but think that the film could have done more with it's source material. Apparently Evey's transformation into V's protégé is much more clear in the novel. I definitely found that in the film, their love seemed a bit forced. I never felt like they had this deep relationship enough to want to go through with these crimes of rebellion. V is also a character that has a fascinating back-story, but one that could have been explored even further than it was. But I do realize that revealing any sort of identity to him ruins the whole point of an idea outweighing one particular person.Major props to Natalie Portman who gives a much vulnerable and daring performance. This was before Black Swan, so I think this was her first major step into dark roles as a young adult. She is terrific as Evey, a troubled and emotionally destroyed woman who soon becomes the face of a revolution. But I have to say I wish the actual revolution was shown more explicitly. We had maybe one big scene of citizens rebelling but that was it. The action looks great in the few scenes we had and it definitely seems more like the Wachowski's directed this than McTeigue. And of course the score we all know is just incredible.+Without fear you are free +Ideas +Portman's dark performance +Action-Could have been even more daring -Could have shown the rebellion in depth -Not sure I believed their love 7.3/10",7,5,7,23 February 2015
Furious 7," For Paul
","The Fast and Furious series is one of the few franchises that has gotten better as they go along. I thought the first few were entertaining but had no real meat or depth to them. The series took off with Fast 5, and has been fantastic ever since. Furious 7 is not only the most insane of the franchise, but it's also by far the most emotional. This movie is simply the reason why I love cinema. It has everything that you would want in an action film, plus the perfect way to honor Paul Walker. I never thought a film with hundreds of punches, huge muscles, and fast cars would move me to tears. Just as Furious 7 was dedicated to Paul Walker, I'm going to dedicate this review to him as well. He was never an Oscar winner, but he was a part of one of the franchises that heightened my love for film. He was known as one of the nicest guys around Hollywood and I can only hope that he's looking down and watching this film with a big smile on his face.Furious 7 plays a lot off of the events of the previous installment as Jason Statham plays Deckard Shaw, brother of the almost fallen Owen Shaw. He's very much like Winter Soldier in Captain America, he appears every now and then tearing through buildings and bodies on his way to avenge his brother. From hear it's Dom, Brian, Hobbs, and the rest of the crew to stop him from taking more lives. Much like the previous films Furious 7 goes across the globe and finds it's way to high speed races with a lot of girls in bikinis. Perhaps they took that a little too far this time but it will only bother you if you don't know what your getting into with these films. Speaking of that, it's just about twice as ridiculous as the 6th film in terms of death defying stunts and action sequences. The action is non stop and the plot can be a bit confusing and convoluted. But considering how much trouble the production went through, I cant blame the filmmakers for any of those faults. They did a tremendous job in retrospective.Newcomers include Kurt Russell and Nathalie Emmanuel who both did a good job. I heard Russell plays a bigger part in the inevitable 8th installment and I would like to see Emmanuel return as well because they both seemed to have a lot of fun with this film. Everyone else is pretty much back including Mia, Elena, and Gisele all making cameos. I have come to love this group so much over the years that it's really great to see everyone together, especially if it's the last time. There's also a side story about the Letty-Dom relationship. That also turned out to be extremely satisfying as a long time fan. But the biggest laughs out of the film come from Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous' banter. It's one of the reasons why the last 3 films have worked so well is the increased chemistry between the crew.The most satisfying part of the film was the ending. Every questioned how they could possibly deal with the death of Walker during the middle of filming, but I have to say they couldn't have handled it any better. The last 10 minutes or so were absolutely gut wrenching. I loved all the big action sequences with cars flying through buildings and one on one fist fights were great. But nothing in terms of filmmaking compared to the final scenes honoring Paul. Vin Diesel giving his final words to him was some of the most emotional moments I have experienced in a film, let alone an action film. The plot doesn't make perfect sense at times, but the message does. Family is and always will be the most important thing in life. Rest in peace Paul Walker.+Action tops anything before +All the characters and more appear +Funny as ever +Perfect send off for Paul 9.3/10",9,2,8,3 April 2015
