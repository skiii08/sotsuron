Sucker Punch," Concept is brilliant... but lazy plot construction.
","Personally, I think the concept is simply brilliant, yet completely left out to dry... Why? Well, I understand that at some points of writing the plot, there are some huge holes that are left to be filled with brainstorm ideas that come after everything. I believe these parts could have been thought through a lot better. First of all, the 'world' they live in switches thrice, the asylum, then the dancing world, then the war world. When the dancing started as the war 'transition' did, I felt banging my head so hard against a table. Maybe they thought it was cool or whatever, but I think it's such a boring way to shortcut through a supposed 'intense' scene of when their going through the most intense moments. And the hypnotizing dance? God! Talk about the biggest upperhand in the world! This movie could have been my favorite ever (based on the concept) but the plot tanked, yet I still enjoyed it. Reasons? The music was brilliant! CONCEPT. The graphics were spectacular! The starting -EPIC- and the ending -loved it!So do I hate it? Can't. Do I love it? Can't. It's not bad. It's not incredible. It actually annoys me that it had the potential to be fantastic-al. That rhymed! REWRITE! Or book version. Either would be awesome.",6,0,1,21 September 2012
