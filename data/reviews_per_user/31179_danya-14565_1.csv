Walk the Line," The Great Movie.
","Walk the Line is a great movie. When you watch it, you feel as though you are watching Johny Cash in person. It is a real good biographical tape. It is dedicated to the life story of the legendary country singer Johnny Cash and his second wife, June Carter. Reese Witherspoon is so cute and beautiful in the film. She absolutely coped with her role. In general, the film is very interesting and not for nothing received an Oscar. You should see this if you like Johnny Cash and country style. The music in the film is so great! Also, every father shoul watch the film to understand their sons.",10,1,1,22 April 2018
