Hereditary," Beautifully-filmed horror with a musical score that pulsates with intensity
","Beautifully filmed and realized, credit should be given to the musical score for staying out the way when needed and bringing the thrills at the most opportune times. Today's accompanying music is usually too loud, not particularly matching what is going on the screen and just plain bad. This is the exception. The score almost makes the movie. That's not to say the rest is not almost equally as fine. The pace may be slow but percolates with tension. The director is adept at showing us just what we need to see and hinting at more to come. It's not all perfect, however: the son, who is supposed to be a young teen but looks closer to 40, elicited embarrassed laughter from the theatre audience on at least two of the most intense scenes when his crying is so fake you have to snicker. Likewise, Toni Collette does a wonderful job here but her accelerating hysteria begins to take away some of the power of her performance. The ending is somewhat anticlimactic and doesn't match the intensity of the rest of the movie. But that's griping. This is a horror movie that avoids most clich√©s while giving us thrills, chills and plenty to talk about afterwards.",8,12,22,13 June 2018
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," Insipid British version of a Hallmark/Lifetime romantic melodrama.
","All signs point to this being a stellar British film about post-WWII Guernsey. Reviews have been great, the acting is top-notch, the concept intriguing, the direction more than adequate. But under its guise as a post-wartime drama, this movie reeks of sentiment and romance at the expense of any revelations about this historical period of time. Feeling like a wasted opportunity, you never get to share the horrors and hardships endured by these people. The whole thing feels skin-deep, revealing neither the true nature of the characters nor the world in which they are desperately trying to restore amid the rubble.While the writing is at times sharp and revealing, the dialog most of the time is tepid and shows little imagination when it comes to encapsulating Guernsey as it recovers from the horrors of Nazi occupation. While the acting is mostly superb, the actors are somewhat blah, making one wonder why should we care about them? If you are into romantic tales full of lust and love, and if you find the major characters to be attractive and interesting, you many find this to be just the ticket. From the glowing reviews, this show obviously hits a nerve that I don't seem to have.",4,4,9,20 August 2018
