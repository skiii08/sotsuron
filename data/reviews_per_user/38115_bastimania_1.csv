Mission: Impossible III," I loved it!
","MI:3 definitely is better then the 2nd part. It is better written and gives the audience the unique MI feeling back again. The settings Rome, China and Berlin contribute to this feeling. The storyline is great as well and the idea with the rabbit foot grabs the audiences attention from the beginning til the end. Finally there is an action movie which gives the audience what it has so long been waiting for. BTW Does anybody know what music was played in the party sequence at the beginning.They had the wedding announcement party. Julie's sister arrived and then suddenly the music kicked in and everybody started to dance. Ethan and Julie started to dance/kiss and it lasted until the phone ring scene came!If anyone knows pls let me know as it has been stuck in my head!",9,0,1,6 May 2006
