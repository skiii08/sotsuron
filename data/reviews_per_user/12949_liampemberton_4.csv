It," Best Stephen King adaptation in years!
","In the second adaptation of the classic horror novel of the same name by Stephen King, IT is the best King adaptation we've had in years. What many of his recent works turned into films seem to be missing, is competency and heart. Director Andy Muschietti gives us both of that. IT is a clear love letter to the 1980s like STRANGER THINGS (Finn Wolfhard is even in both), and at its heart, it's not a horror film, but a sweet coming-of-age story, that would make the film better than it is, because let me tell you this: It's a horror movie with a creepy clown, but that's not what makes IT IT. It's really the coming-of-age drama, watching these characters grow and experience love, bullying, etc. Whenever the movie is just about the Losers Club swimming or fighting their bullies, the story is at its peak, but then Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgard) shows up, and my entertainment is drowned, and now what I'm witnessing is loads of misery, that is still fun, but not as engaging because to be quite frank, I don't care much about horror.All the child actors in IT do a good job, but the performance everyone keeps coming back to is Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise, who is clearly very committed to the role, and thankfully not trying to imitate Tim Curry, but make a version of his own.",7,0,0,9 September 2019
Captain Marvel," Another win for Marvel
","After 11 years and 21 movies, we finally have our first female-led Marvel hero film, and while it's not up there with Guardians of the Galaxy or The Winter Solder as the best of the bunch, Captain Marvel is still a lot of fun to watch and works well as a stand-alone feature. There's some issues I had which I'll get into in a bit, but I also can't deny just how entertaining of an experience it was.Despite a few stiff line readings here and there, Brie Larson is wonderful as Carol Danvers AKA Captain Marvel herself as she infuses the character with power, heart, and a bit of mystery as she tries to uncover what happened in her past that she can no longer remember. Her chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson is off-the-charts good as the two of them create a classic buddy-cop dynamic, Ben Mendelsohn gets some of the best comedic moments as an alien warrior who comes to Earth looking for this film's MacGuffin, and Goose the cat rightly earns his place among the great cinematic felines in ways that I wouldn't dare spoil.This is basically a standard origin story on paper, but by framing it in a way where we're as lost as Danvers as she tries to figure out who she really is, it makes the story feel a bit fresher than most other first installments in a superhero franchise. Setting the story in 1995 creates the potential for plenty of jokes involving everything from Radio Shack to dial-up Internet that work more often than not, the visual effects are truly spectacular especially the de-aging effects for Jackson who convincingly looks 25 years younger, I loved the musical score which has the feel of a sci-fi space epic from the 90's, and the film's two moments devoted to Stan Lee are PERFECT.As for issues, I don't think directors Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck have the best eye for action sequences when it comes to how to shoot them. They do a good job finding the human side of this superhuman especially in the second half of the film where she encounters an old friend, but while some of the action was exciting, other moments such as a fight scene near the end were over-edited or simply couldn't tell what was happening onscreen.",7,0,1,9 March 2019
Iron Man 2," Fun joyride
","In the sequel to IRON MAN and prequel to THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we follow Tony Stark facing court due to the usage of Stark company weapons, and at the same time fight the film's two villains, Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). The film also introduces Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to the MCU, who has the best fight scene in the whole movie.To be honest, this film is more forgettable than THE INCREDIBLE HULK. IRON MAN 2 lacks so much of the charm and fun that made the first film great, and tries really hard to capture that same magic, but to me the first IRON MAN film just feels like a lightning in a bottle, and the kind of story it tells and the WAY it tells, and plays off is so much more grounded and compelling than the sequel. For a lot of its runtime it feels IRON MAN 2 is drifting off from character to character that are building up to the climax, but I don't know if I missed something or not, because I never felt like the movie was actually building to anything.On to the things I approve of in the movie, Johansson is a fantastic addition, and though she doesn't do A LOT in the movie, her fight scene near the end is kickass, and as for Robert Downey Jr., he is great as usual, but to me the stand outs of the film are Rourke and Rockwell. Rourke is pretty menacing in the role, and Rockwell is a comedic, Saul Goodman-type character, and a joy to watch.Despite not having a very compelling plot, IRON MAN 2 is still a fun joyride that is elevated by good performances, and a badass main character.",7,0,0,15 April 2019
Lincoln," Great film, except for that ending
","In this historical biopic directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg, we follow a specific time during Abraham Lincoln's life, particularly the passing of the 13th Amendment which is the abolishment of slavery.There are a lot of great things about this film, and what I'm going to praise first is the screenplay. Tony Kushner presents us a very dialogue driven story of the great President, which was a nice surprise. Nearly every scene, every conflict and argument is pushed forward by a lot of dialogue, and if you aren't on board with it from the beginning and cannot keep up with the politics, then this film isn't for you. I'll admit I myself couldn't always follow some of the dialogue, but still managed to be riveted by the performances that were speaking the dialogue, from Sally Field to Tommy Lee Jones and Sir Daniel Day-Lewis, of course, as the Mr. President.We already know Lewis is objectively speaking the greatest actor of all time, and he is fantastic as usual here. From his presence and command to the makeup on his face, Lewis completely DISAPPEARS in the role and plays a hero with vulnerability, conflicts to face, and an entire nation to run.On the negative side, LINCOLN does suffer from a poorly executed ending, with Spielberg doing a dumb switcharoo, showing a stage performance at a theatre with a man coming in and yelling the President has died in the OTHER THEATRE, and then the film cuts to him on the bed as he dies. Rather than choosing to end the film before Lincoln's assassination or properly show it happening and developing it, Spielberg does neither.Overall LINCOLN is not a film for everyone, but if you can sit through 2 1/2 hours of slow burn and lots of dialogues about politics, then you're in for a delightful treat.",7,0,1,6 May 2019
