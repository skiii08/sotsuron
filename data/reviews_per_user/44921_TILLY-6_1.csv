The Blair Witch Project," Would you sleep in the woods again after seeing The Blair Witch Project?
","The Blair Witch Project, it makes you question yourself: Am I ever going to camp in the woods ever again? Take a hike in a forest with a reputation of unexplained deaths? Not over my dead body. The movie leaves you unsettling. No closure for the answer. You want to see what is actually happening but, there is nothing to see, only to listen to the horrifying screams. For that, is the reason I love this movie.",Null,1,1,4 August 1999
