Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," CooL MoViE!!
","I think this is the BEST movie I have ever seen!I also like the old Star Wars episodes.A lot of people think Jar Jar Binks is a dumb creature,but he takes work to make the movie completed.Lots of people think when ANAKIN'S RACING,but I think the DARTH MAUL FIGHTING part is the best part of the movie.I am waiting for Episode 2 and 3.Which will come out when I'm A TEENAGER.I think this is ONE George Lucas's favorite movie he ever created.MISTAKES: I found a couple mistakes in Episode 1,one is when Qui-Gon is hurt by Darth Maul's lightsaber,and he is on the ground with his hand down,then in the next shot his hand is on his chest again.And the other one is Mace Windu at the end,it is not Samuel L. Jackson when he gets of the ship to see Naboo.NICE JOB GEORGE!",10,0,2,6 February 2000
