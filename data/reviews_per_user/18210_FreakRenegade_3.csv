The Lobster," Visionary
","The Lobster is not a movie you watch every day. The Lobster and a movie: Visionary Accurate Dreamlike. Actual Real. The author Yorgos Lanthimos, lays bare a contemporary society, made up of very specific rules, made of mass choices, where the collective has not the individual. The mirror of our society, the thin line that separates the rule of married life, the 'horrible and traumatic' choosing to live alone. You can live on their own and be free? Be happy? No It can not because now the society to also impose the rules. You can not: do not you have to be happy. Not only can you not be yourself. I really appreciated the narrative style of the film, inspired by the old silent films, combining the current contemporaneity. We are a society bred like cattle, we are a collective, we have lost our identity is individual, we have lost the most important thing: Free thinking.",7,2,4,18 May 2016
Interstellar," Disappointment
","I was expecting another movie, I expected a science fiction movie, a philosophical movie. I am very disappointed. This movie is boring. Meaningless. Excellent special effects, good actors, McConaughey talented, every little expression every little gesture. Scientific theories all true, inserted in a context so should be simplified. They are too difficult, the dialogs all chaotic. This film does not make sense. And the worst science fiction movies that I've seen. Getting started is as annoying as the main character behaves with one of the two children, treats him like an old rag, while her daughter her favorite is the queen. for 2 hours of film his obsession with his family; no excuse for the daughter she existed only to get to the end where his daughter, does not care about his father. The cube that looked like the Borg cube, sent from the future in a time without time ....... The other astronauts launched into space as a sling from a black hole .... This movie does not make sense I repeat: The worst science fiction movies ever seen.Sorry for my bad English",1,7,14,26 August 2015
The Purge," Truthful
","The Sandin family is a family like many other, husband, wife, two children, a comfortable life. James her husband has a good job, well paid, in fact sells surveillance systems. It helps people to choose the best way to defend themselves from the aggressions which can be called during the day 'purge.' THE PURGE: To counter the growing number of crimes, the American state, decides to set up once a year on the day of the outburst. During the days of the outburst, all crimes are made legal, with only two limits, the prohibition of attacking government officials, and the use of high-caliber military weapons. The night comes the Purge, the Sandin family prepares, locked in the house to face the usual night. But what happens when someone asks for help? How to deal with it? Continue the night pretending not to hear? Or help and to run the risk? The film leaves a strong imprint, showing from different points of view. The young son Charlie decides to help a stranger who asks for help, they themselves become victims of the wrath of the 'purifiers', the boyfriend of the daughter hiding in the house wants to kill James. The night of the outburst thus becomes a journey into the human soul, through fears, phobias, suspicions; digging out under torrents of words, the essence of the real self. The final and beautiful, the neighbors, the same neighbors who have been selling alarm systems, those neighbors who smile friendly day after day, in reality they are angry angry, envious. Express their hatred towards the perpetrators of profiting from Sandin and live behind them. But they fail to carry it out; the siren sounds, everything returns to normal. For the remaining 365 days have to live side by side, as if nothing had happened. This film impressed me so much, why and real. The actual feelings that people experience, are the ones that people experience every day, hatred, resentment, envy of friends, colleagues, neighbors. The movie slips in the most obscure sides of the human soul, intimately despoiling the side of people that 'yes, I really would make' Think about it, If it really is applied to reality this film would immediately become a documentary.",9,0,1,8 May 2016
