The Hangover," So bad it made me angry
","I signed up for IMDb just so I could review this piece of bland garbage. There is no character development. No dramatic tension... everybody is nearly the same character. The 'oh man what happened last night?' thing gets old after about three minutes. Cheap unbelievable situations they got themselves into, predictable jokes, and cruel, unlikely gags (the kids tasering the prisoner). Look I married a stripper and she treats me like she knows me so well! How is this even possible? Most of the crazy things that happened did not seem believable, the movie simply came up with the same tired clich√©s and put them together and expected the audience to swoon. Oh and the wussy guy finally tells off his nagging woman at the end of the movie... big deal, we saw that coming. Overall it was a ham-fisted attempt to re-do the 'we got drunk and did crazy things' movie.",2,5,8,6 April 2013
