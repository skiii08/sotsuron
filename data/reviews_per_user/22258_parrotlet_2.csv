Iron Man 3," Pepper Potts is an intelligent woman; why would she allow herself to be a pushover
","I'm very disappointed that Pepper Potts would always allow herself to be pushed around by Tony Stark, even though she is clearly an intelligent and capable woman. She degraded herself to being a slave that only does whatever her master (Tony) wants her to do.
She rejects business offers because 'Tony wouldn't like it.' Not because of her own will.I hope that in future movies, Pepper allows herself to be free of Tony's influence, and to make decisions that don't serve Tony's desires or wellbeing, but her own wants. She should also have a breaking point, where she questions Tony's ideology, and become enemies with Tony. This woman has potential.",4,1,1,19 April 2019
Iron Man 2," It was disappointing...
","It wasn't as good as the first movie. The introduction of two new superheroes seemed unnecessary, like a buildup to a deus ex machina.
It also relied too much on the villain, Asian Ironman clone. Whereas the first movie explored Ironman's character development and learning new lessons, in this movie, he not only didn't evolve his character, he seemed to forget some of the lessons he learned in the previous movie. In the previous movie, he transformed from a uncaring party-boy into someone who left behind his bad ways behind to pursue peace.
This movie had one good point, the fact that Ironman was slowly being poisoned by his own suit. This could have been expanded to symbolize how his pride was ruining him. He could have undergone a character transformation in this movie, to stop being so prideful, while simultaneously finding his cure. Unfortunately, the writers did not expand into deeper realms like they did for the previous movie.",4,0,0,19 August 2018
