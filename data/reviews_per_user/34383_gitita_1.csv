Requiem for a Dream," A Requiem For An Ordinary Thinking
","This movie is definitely one of the strongest, breathtaking, amazing films I've ever seen. I believe that a great movie can be decided by the time it takes you to get over it , and go on with your normal daily life. In this case 'Requiem' is not letting my mind settle down for month's now...This movie involves a lot of great filmmaking elements. The narrative is wonderful, the plot is very fascinating and the story is being built during the film with the right rhythm. The acting is absolutely perfect and all the characters are well put together and described by director Aronofsky. One of the things i liked most in this film is that the situations which characters are caught into can be taken from reality. Sara Glodfarb's Addiction (acted wonderfully by Allan Burstyn) can be real. We live in a world where good looks and being famous are things to look up to by each and everyone of us .It is normal of her wanting to look good and loose weight. I really liked Tyrone's scenes with his mother. It is a beautiful scene when he is having sex and than right afterwards we are able to see him looking at his mother's picture with great pain of a child that misses his dead mom. The movie features great editing. The drug use scenes are fast and very strong, editor used short shots and inter-cuts of the eyes, the hand and the needle.We can also be noted to another real life fact, when things are going well, love between Harry(Gared Leto) and Marion(Connely) really flourish . But than when things are being mess up problems and fights are starting to appear. The soundtrack is wonderful. I remember a friend of mine watching the film in another room and I couldn't help not listening to the terrible sounds that 'flashback' me into strong memories. But what I liked most is the deterioration of all main characters during the film. Coming to an outstanding scene near the end when all for characters - Sara, Harry, Marion & tyrone are lying down in a baby-like figure, each in his own terrible physical, emotional and mental state. Sara - all crazy and ill. Harry - lost his hand and maybe his girlfriend. Marion - had sold her body for money and drugs. and Tyrone - with great pain for not having his mother close to him when needed.'A Requiem For A Dream' is a powerful movie. I had friends that just couldn't finish watching it because it is so electrifying and strong. Some Cried hard. But most important - You cannot go straight back to normal life after this one. It just hammer an unforgettable trademark in your heart that makes you think. Think and admire this piece of art, and of course - watch it time and time again, enjoying and suffering every moment...Wrote: Ofer Kadar (Gitita's brother)- Maoz Haim, ISRAEL.",Null,0,1,11 February 2002
