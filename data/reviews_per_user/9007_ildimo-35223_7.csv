Catch Me If You Can," A rare Spielberg melancholia.
","A rare example of an attempted Spielberg melancholia and it is the most delicate, the most elegant one. Imbued in the spirit of the typical spielbergian disintegration of the family, this one drives on with exquisite taste and grande finesse to a condition (again typical in the director) of familial reinstatement, only this time of a completely different, disillusioned type.
A great, unexpected Christmas film, too.",10,0,1,27 December 2017
It," '80s aesthetics bullseye
","Even further than just being an '80s revival product - you know that thing that started out as nostalgia (Super 8, Expendables) and is now a full blown mania (Guardians of the Galaxy, Stranger Things, etc.) that rules box-office and, on occasion, pop music - 'It' is the correct one. It has the structure, the aesthetics, the 'each face corresponding to its mirror image from the era' (there is a homework for you truthful ones!), the meta-jokes ('It's bullshit, it's a Gazebo!').
It is it.Watching it one gets a good idea of why King is the pop culture royalty he is -he digs into the collective fears of the western id AND the American superego locating the source of trauma - here racial tensions, disintegrated family, bullying and incest take the cake.Muschietti is in complete control of his means, anything more tempered would miss the point of it going full retro, I can't see how the 40-ish generation (who liked it back then) won't be charmed by it.Hell, enjoy it while it lasts. Directors/screenwriters/designers and DPs who grew up in the '80s are now having their field day feeling kids again, recreating the seeming simplicity of it all. I suppose this all '80s thing won't make it for more than 5-6 years from now.",6,0,1,13 December 2017
The Shape of Water," Del Toro's beautiful, solitary path perfected.
","Lovingly informed throughout by the '30s, the '50s, cinema (and '50s cinema), J.P. Jeunet, Cocteau and Spielberg, 'The Shape of Water' is an out of the ordinary (but not altogether exceptional) tale of romance and poetic love, told (in the best places, whispered) in the manner of the uninhibited poetic fantasy of bygone eras Del Toro seems to incurably cling to.
I love him for that.",7,20,36,9 January 2018
The Disaster Artist," One from the artist's heart.
","Obviously a deeply personal film, Franco's latest (before the tide of four films almost ready for this year), is one from the heart, not so much for cinema itself as for the pathos that drives some people to create cinema.
Even if you don't get the real 'Room' allusions, even if this poor man's (a bit moody) Cassavetes is not your cup of tea (let alone if you haven't seen your 'Ed Wood' several times over), 'The Disaster Artist' almost perfectly captivates the moment when a work of 'art' is revered for the polar opposite reasons it was made while at the same time exposing its auteur's heartbreaking need for recognition and addressing the perennial idea that art, like truth, is in the eyes of the beholder.
Not a small feat.",6,1,2,8 January 2018
Mystic River," Perfect Eastwood dialectics
","The incredible potency of Eastwood's visual metaphysics (see how the camera so often in his work hovers from above like some perverted God's eyeview that watches but never interferes) meets the substantial (both existential and political) crosscutting (the aesthetic breakthrough of this entry of his) of children/adults perpetually engulfed in their sins.
The nightmarish web is further complexed by the no less than four females of the story (and the ghosts of two more, adding to an amazing number of characters for a 138-minute film), building a challenging case of a feminist, anti-feminist and tragedy-like reading of the impossibly dense text.
Eastwood dialectics at their most complete - even though perfection is a breath away due to the mechanics of a couple of male performances.",9,1,1,1 February 2018
Mother!," Aronofski's return to form - and gutsy filmmaking
","The way I see it a hard film to love yet one I cannot but deeply appreciate for the powers that drive its making.
If one is to digest this utterly pretentious and yet magnificently bold and audacious picture (btw it is men who have created the most audacious and bold feminist statements on film AND the most unrelenting critiques to patriarchy), one has to explore its dream/nightmare quality, its tonally masterful strokes of comedy and, alas, the unabashedly heartfelt, self (male/artist)-incriminating, insightful study of the (in-love) female psyche.The outcome is a perfectly controlled throughout, biblically hysteric and cautiously framed chaos, that inevitably bashes out the borders of what a filmmaker is 'allowed' to show. Still, in all its unhinged havoc, deep down one feels this is what Hollywood must do in order to meet some groundbreaking demand.",8,0,2,13 December 2017
Heat," 22 years on undisputed perfection
","In the light of the 22 years past and gone after it, 'Heat' looks prophetic even in its take on the fall of machismo as a decadent, female-less world option, one in which men can only dream of being accompanied but actually end up holding each other's lifeless hands.Still, after all is said and done, Mann's work, steeped in its steel blues, and dimmed blurred lights of some deep background (as if Gatsby's green light refers once more to men beating on 'boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past'), remains the finest, saddest urban rhapsody of people irretrievably lost on what they 're after.",10,0,1,13 December 2017
