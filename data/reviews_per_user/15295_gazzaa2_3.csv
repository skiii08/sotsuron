Scarface," The Ultimate Gangsta film - Pacino at this best
","When Scarface first hit cinemas, the general consensus was that it was a poor film, too overly violent and a waste of time. The Cinema was full of walk outs on it's first showing and the critics blasted it. Now those same people and same critics pinpoint it as one of the leading and popular gangsta films and one of Al Pacino's best and most memorable performances.It's the classic rise and fall tale of a big time gangster which was Cuban Tony Motana a 'political refugee' played by Al Pacino. The shoot out at the end and various quotes throughout the film are legendary but the film goes along at a nice smooth pace with a great soundtrack. The violence is hard hitting from the start and can come at any time, which always leaves the view on edge and sets the tone and never dragging.The film has everything and is superbly directed by Brian De Palma and is second only to Scorsese's superbly directed 'Goodfella's in terms of gangster direction. Tony Montana has all the leading male qualities and Pacino holds the screen brilliantly whenever Montana has a line (literally).Probably the film of the 80s",9,0,1,2 September 2005
The Departed," Scorcese back on form with a modern classic
","As a big fan of Martin Scorcese and his earlier films, I have long waited for him to produce a modern classic and return to his favoured gangster genre. Goodfellas, Casino and Mean Streets specifically are all gangster classics but in recent times, his modern stuff, like The Gangs of New York hasn't been as watchable. I wondered before hand, whether this re-make of the Asian classic 'Internal Affairs' was wise but as re-makes go, its fantastic. The difference this time was the classic script was back; The Departed is wonderfully written and like Goodfellas from all different angles. Its hard hitting, its funny, its tough and gritty but unlike Goodfellas, it doesn't attempt to humanise, either the Gangsters, or show their good side, or even the same with the law side. Its every man for himself in the film but what every character values deep down is loyalty and throughout the film some have it in abundance and others only to an extent. While the selfishness and greed is the downfall of some, loyalty is the downfall of others.Jack Nicholson produces his best performance for a long time as Irish boss Frank Costello and Ray Winston is good as a more dumbed down role, as Costello's right hand man. These two men value loyalty but only show it to each other and Costello is a dangerous man to trust.Matt Damon and Leonardo Di Caprio play differing but similar ambiguous roles and rarely appear as they seem to the people they get close to, whilst both having a keen interest in the same woman. Billy Costigan played by Di Caprio is a man with no ties in his life and whilst looking to get into law enforcement is sent on a mission to bring down Costello and his crew and has a tough job trying to keep his cover. This isn't made any easier by Matt Damon's character Sullivan, who is sent by Costello into law enforcement to keep the crew on the street and out of jail. Martin Sheen and Mark Whalberg play excellent supporting roles in the police force and are the only cops who know about Costigan's undercover operation but struggle to keep it a secret, while finding out who the rat is, in their department.The plot twists and unfolds in a thrilling and unpredictable way, right till the end and goes down easily as one of the best gangster films of the decade. Highly recommended",9,0,2,13 October 2006
Goodfellas," The reality of the mafia
","The remarkable true story of Henry Hill and the crime family to which he associates, paints a true picture of life in the mob. A fantastic transformation of book to screen, directed in excellent fashion by Scorcese; while sticking in great detail to the story of Henry Hill's narratated book Wise Guy.The casting for this film was perfect. Joe Pesci as Tommy put in an amazing performance and won the films only Oscar as Best supporting actor. Robert De Niro put a top performance in as Irish borderline psycho hustler Jimmy Conway and Ray Liotta put a career marking performance as leading character Henry Hill. The supporting cast was excellent also in a film with every day believable characters all the while, despite the world they were in.The film starts off with Henry as a young kid, desperate to be a gangster like the mob guys on his street, in a neighbourhood of 'schmucks' in Long Island. Henry hustles his way into the money, which he passes up to his mob boss protector Paulie. The money he scams gives him respect on the street but he can never be a made guy because of his Irish father. The first hour of the film is a tale of the great life they were living but as is the way in organised crime it can't last and they ultimately lead to their own downfall through excess and greed; something that emphasised the times, from the late 60s and 70s setting.It's a landmark in directing as freeze frames, pauses, a lack of continuity at times, a forward premonition at the start and a great scene where Henry and his then girlfriend Karen enter the Copa through the back door. It's stylish but unlike say with Tarantino in Pulp Fiction it's done in a gritty sense, rather than just for show. The film leads you into thinking that although the gangster life is great while it lasts, it's an empty world where you can be whacked at anytime for anything by your supposed best friend.",9,0,0,26 February 2006
