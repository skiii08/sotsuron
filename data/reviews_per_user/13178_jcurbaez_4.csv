Deja Vu," How to rip off CSI and The Terminator in 5 easy steps
","Had it matched its title just a tad bit more, this movie would have been more believable. When I bought the ticket my mind was somewhat made up that a cop with certain clairvoyance skills would draw a case to a close but man, this time travel thing just gave the movie a wrong twist I can't honestly buy -not to enter the fact that over the first 30 minutes it hints to become a 2-hour-long CSI episode, if one only refers to the electronic incidental music, two guys and a corpse at the morgue, and so on so forth as evidence of my theory, LOL. As a matter of fact, by minute 30 I was already labeling this as 'CSI New Orleans'. Interesting that a movie can be led in a logical and plausible sequence to its very end on such weak pretenses, not to say that this doesn't come too far beyond, either, from being a 1984's The Terminator's failed rip-off. Nonetheless, The Terminator succeeds in passing the time traveling thing over a secondary place, which is not a merit of Deja Vu. You have to forcibly suspend your disbelief on this movie's intended time travel method if you want to get this past and not to find yourself wanting your money back. Otherwise, it won't work.",7,1,2,28 December 2006
Casino Royale," This sets off a new Bond era
","Nobody has ever mentioned the fact that DC had already led an already-formed actor career, able to pull off real dramatic situations, at the moment of taking over the James Bond role while Pierce Brosnan, even though with a career also, would be considered a 'star' -with the whole of its negative connotation- rather than an actual actor. I still remember how Brosnan had struggled all the way to get the role: believe it or not, he was no first choice at all even before Timothy Dalton.It might be the first time EVER a real actor and not just a mug poser is cast in a Bond movie. And yes, many other Bond features look awfully dull compared to the one presently into question. But we should also take into consideration that, along with Batman Begins and Superman Returns, this film intends to settle the way how a well-known character is and why he would become what he did or why he would trust no one besides running for shelter when it comes to real emotional attachments -and that's why he comes into a seashell towards the very end: this stands for James Bond's vulnerability, fact which had been kind of put aside over the very large number of years of Bond's character development. That is what, I guess, makes the difference. I don't think Pierce Brosnan would have possibly or successfully pulled this off. Seriously.",Null,0,1,28 December 2006
Happy Feet," When reality -and not a cute tap-dancing penguin- is disturbing
","When you see a number of messages in the discussion board asserting on that direction, you start wondering if being gay is the only way for an individual to differentiate from the rest. Each person is different on a simple basis and should be encouraged to follow the natural drives of his own.Happy Feet gets right on the money when it comes to tolerance -which is not to be disposed of for the sake of a single group in particular but for everyone's, whereas some threads on the Happy Feet's forum evince, in a nearly startling manner, how much we lack it- and the necessity of putting both melody and rhythm together to create music -this resulting, IMO, in harmonious co-existence instead of perversion-. Moreover, this movie stands for the ones whose parents -to name only a pattern we keep seeing all over the world- made a hardship of their struggle to gain a position in life as musicians, artists, or even ball players since kids -these kinds of parent would say- had better attend a School of Law: all the ones who had to put up with frustration over quite a few years due to whatever society may believe is best for us could have found themselves depicted or reflected in Happy Feet. Not everyone was born to join a firm but to take a different call instead, however admitting that it also might work the other way around.Anyway, Happy Feet has achieved its goal by bringing the tolerance topic on the spot. Trying to make up people's mind that Happy Feet is apologetic of homosexuality -as if a homosexual, or a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Negro, or a Latino, or anyone else who doesn't pace along with the mainstreaming majority were THE problem itself, as some may make us believe by means of an actually discriminatory and manipulative framework- is no less than an evil attempt to misleadingly simplify a yet deeper and still current issue.",Null,1,3,15 January 2007
Back to the Future," Unfairly cast out
","British paper The Guardian published few years ago a list of the 10 best Sci-Fi movies ever according to the opinion of scientists. I do agree with the ones who handed the prize over Blade Runner after a good bundle of titles were cast out in quite a sensitive selection. However, while scrolling down on the honor list I did not find Back to the Future included (Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back were there nonetheless and in my very humble opinion both films are space-epic rather than genetically pure Sci-Fi).Back to the Future can be considered a typical yet serious Sci-Fi movie: all of the main aspects regarding time traveling, such as how the time machine's engine is put to work or how these kinds of trip generate time-space paradoxes, are present and clearly enough explained. This movie's progression was as well very carefully and dynamically put into sequence. Back to the Future is a classic for those who were teenagers (and the not so young ones of that time) when it was first released. Emmet Brown is arguably one of the most remarkable mad scientists ever created (by the way, mad scientists are another main topic in Sci-Fi) and I never tire of watching its re-runs over and over again, anytime.Well, perhaps it's just me, being not an important scientist but a picky moviegoer. I hope this works as a recognition of MY own. Back to the Future will keep rocking yet far beyond the few years to come.",9,0,1,26 August 2004
