The Blair Witch Project," Its not what you see thats scary, its what your imagination sees itself.
","This movie is just simply, a classic! I won't blab about the storyline, but it just shows you how good a film can be, with such a low budget.The actors, in this film are some of the best that I have seen. Much of the script was improvised and they handle some terrifying situations, letting their fear show to the audience. The thing that makes this film scary, is that you never see the witch. Its just your imagination playing tricks on you, giving you ideas of what it might look like, thats the scariest part.This film gives a strong, scary atmosphere which is better watched with all the lights turned out. The end scene is just truely psychologically terrifying. I couldn't sleep for days after seeing the stars 'bumped' off in such a way.I think some people in the cinema were disappointed. So the film is a little overated. It just depends on what you think when you start to watch it. Just don't expect it to be the scariest film ever, as you'll be disappointed!",Null,0,2,24 November 1999
