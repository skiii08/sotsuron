The Blair Witch Project," scrap, boring, bad, disgusting
",Need I go on.  The worst film I have ever seen.  It is of bad taste to take advantage or three young people that might have been murdered and cut in pieces and show this to every one.This film isn't scary and there is nothing going on.  I can only feel sad for these three young people.  The authors of this film (atrocity) should be prosecuted and put to jail.I nearly felt asleep during that film or should I say that thing!!!.,Null,0,0,8 August 1999
Independence Day," Great FX, underdeveloped characters and poorly used actors
","This movie is great if you want to see a lot of FX effects, if you like S-Fi and if you like the good guys to win.I liked it though the story was not that developed, the characters were a bit trivial and sterotypical and the actors (who are very good Jeff Godblum, Bill Pulman Will Smith) were not used to their full potential.  But it is worth seeing a couple or times or more...",Null,0,0,21 May 1999
The Sixth Sense," Excellent movie, a must see
","Good story, good scares without special effects like in the haunting, good believable characters, good actors, etc... a very good film.  I dropped my guard and jumped a couple of times.The little boy who played Cole is amazingly good.If you like good stories and good acting and a character driven drama filled with chills and without a million special effects you'll love the sixth senseIf you want to chat about it my ICQ number is 35321097Rojan",10,0,0,15 August 1999
