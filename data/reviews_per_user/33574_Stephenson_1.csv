Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Utter disappointment
","As everyone who loves Star Wars I was looking forward to this film with such delight. However after viewing this film, i left the cinema with utter disappointment. I think that this flim was made purely for money. There is not indepth story of the characters. Infact there are far too many of them.However the only good point on this film was the relationship between anakin and the queen. But even that was limited!I thought this flim was more like $tar War$: The pure con. Lucas built he's house from the merchandise of the charaters ouy of the first trilogy, and with all the charaters in this, he could buy a country.I felt the flim destroyed the Star Wars feeling totally.",3,1,2,3 April 2001
