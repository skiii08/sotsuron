Blade Runner 2049," A helpless attempt to earn easy money on a beloved franchise
","I really wish villeneuve keep doing something he's good at, like music videos maybe, but not the movies, especially not the movies which shouldn't supposed to exist at all (im looking at you blade runner). Oh god how good he's at visuals and how bad he's in storytelling. If I should imagine something that could possibly bore me to death I would imaging watching vileneuve's Blade Runner once again. I shouldn't even try to remember all the plot holes, which are plenty, all is needed to kill me in the most awful way is to recall all the pity dialogs, which aim to spoon feed everything that's going on on the screen. I could go on with a so called pseudo philosophy shoved at my throat every moment for the sake of the predecessor - a well known vileneuve's helpless attempts to appear an intellectual geek from Hollywood.",4,6,9,6 January 2019
Parasite," Eastern style fantasy
","I tend to like western fantasy more, because it's about fictional places and abilities, not behaviors.",2,0,5,27 April 2020
Mother!," Clumsy metaphor for another metaphor which was maybe a metaphor for some another metaphor
",Do you know what metaphor the screwed breakfast and hot frypan stand for? Of course it's the DuPont Teflon waste disaster.,4,0,0,13 March 2019
Annihilation," Beautiful and promising, yet disappointing
","The film just lacks a ton of logic. There were such many promises in the beginning so I started hoping maybe for something like Tarkovsky's Stalker or Solaris, instead I got the cliche horror ending. Just meh.",6,2,4,6 January 2019
