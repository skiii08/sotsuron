10 Cloverfield Lane," Enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane pretty much.
","To make a good thriller movie, There are three elements need to be well made in my point of view. These elements are the plot, the cinematography, and the movie score. 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of a few great suspense, mystery movies that fulfilled the three elements successfully. This movie takes you on an unsettling creepy journey to get answers for many questions in a smart young women's head wants to reach a logical resolution to what happened to her. you can touch the tension level increases gradually from the beginning of the film tell the end. The music score is insanely amazing. It hooks you once the movie starts. I really want to thank Bear McCreary for this score. No one can deny the amazing performance of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I can't wait to see the next project of the ambitious director, Dan Trachtenberg who has a directing talent should be invested well in the future. 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely worth seeing. I watched it twice in the theater which is, by the way, a rare event to do.",8,0,0,29 July 2017
