The Longest Yard," Good Film to Watch on a Transcontinental Flight (Z-z-z-z-z)
","My son rented this DVD. I like Adam Sandler and I remembered enjoying the original 1974 title starring Burt Reynolds, so I was looking forward to seeing the remake. Unfortunately, besides miscasting Sandler as a pro football quarterback (I was subconsciously waiting for him to come onto the football field driving his lawnmower from 'The Waterboy'), the film is little more than a melange of one-liners and lame racial jokes. The story never builds any serious tension and the actors look lost. Yes, Courteny Cox' breasts were nice in the opening scene, but even they couldn't carry this dog. This film insults its audience - there were so many inaccuracies and unlikely scenarios that I lost my ability to suspend disbelief. I hope Adam Sandler gets better roles in the future.",1,7,15,21 October 2005
Dodgeball," Cute Film.
","I used to play dodgeball every day in grade school and my border collie is named Dodger, so of course I would like this film. I had forgotten the angst and excitement of the game but it came back in a rush.The predictable plot focuses on a group of loser/nerd underdogs who manage to pull together and win the day over the smarmy, over-self-confident villains. This film is light comedy that kept me chuckling like an idiot but not feeling too guilty about it. Ben Stiller steals the show as the hilarious pumped-up villain on steroids. Christine Taylor is nice eye candy. Everyone else does a creditable job and seemed to enjoy making this film.",8,1,2,8 November 2004
