Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The most enjoyable film of the year
","Star Wars: The Phantom Menace it by far the most enjoyable and fun film of the year.  From the classic opening credits to the final shot I was entertained.  Despite what critics say: Jar-Jar is not the most annoying character ever, the actors can act and the script isn't awful - it's just Star Wars.  For those who say that it doesn't explain things in enough detail, remember that Star Wars, Empire and Jedi are aimed at EVERYBODY, kids and all.  All in all, a completely enjoyable, breathtaking and marvelous cinematic experience.",9,7,9,15 July 1999
