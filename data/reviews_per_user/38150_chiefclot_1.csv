Ali," It's not that bad!
","OK, so i don't think this film is genius or anything but I am surprised that it has such a low average rating. I can't really comment on how the script relates to reality (not old enough really) but if nothing else the acting is all excellent - from what I've seen and heard Will Smith's portrayal of Ali is bang on - especially with regard to his interview style and his combination of arrogance and genius. Jon Voight too is excellent, particularly his interaction with Smith in the press conference scenes and Jamie Foxx also seems to do a decent job. 8/10",8,1,2,20 October 2003
