The Blair Witch Project," Scary, I think not
","I just saw The Blair Witch Project and I think that it wasn't the least bit scary, unless your afraid of the woods. And the supposedly scary noises at night, I didn't even get the slightest bit frightened by them. This movie looked like a student project (I think it was from the shaky camera angles, and the bad film shots). So far this summer has been a grave (pun intended) year for scary movies, I just hope that The Sixth sense is a LOT better than The Blair Witch Project, Deep Blue Sea, The Haunting (yawn).",4,0,1,5 August 1999
