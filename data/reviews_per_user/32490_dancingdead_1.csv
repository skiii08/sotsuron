Hereditary," Awful film and not in a good way.
","Please do not waste your money on this, don't even buy the DVD when it's out. This was the biggest disappointment since Veronica and The Meg has just came in joint place with this film. Both massively over-hyped and massively lacking in any shocks, horror etc. I would sooner watch paint dry than watch this again.The acting from the main lead was awful, the only good bit was at the end, shortly before the credits. Too slow for a slow burn and that's saying something.",1,35,74,12 August 2018
