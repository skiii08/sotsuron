Black Swan," Do you believe ballet can drive people crazy?
","This movie is beyond my expectation. What I mean is, I believe those who love to watch exciting movie like Fast and Furious or Star Wars can enjoy watching it undoubtedly. Too often watching some movies received Academy Award nomination is a snooze fest, especially ones in which actors or actresses are free to demonstrate their acting skills. Black Swan, however, is not a tedious movie at all. Even if you are not interested in ballet, you still can have fun watching it because the movie puts less emphasis on ballet. And I want to suggest that those who don't like thriller and bloody movies should not watch it. Well runs a saying that there is a fine line between genius and insanity. Too often it takes great pains to pursuit and achieve perfection for a artist. This movie presents the process in which Natalie Portman, as a ballerina, wants to dance the Swan Lake to perfection and shoulders a great deal of responsibility and, of course, stress that eventually drives her crazy. At first, I regard the movie as a B movie or a cult because in many scenes some horrible objects or elements jump out at me out of the blue; Nevertheless, the psychological condition of the Nina as well as the lamentable yet reasonable ending appeals to me. After watching it, I still cannot distinguish reality from virtuality, just like another brilliant movie, Shutter Island, which put audience in Nina's place, experiencing paranoia and lunacy together with her. Choosing ballet, which seems a graceful performance, to be the theme for interpreting repression, thriller and crazy is a perfect idea for sure.",9,1,1,25 January 2018
It," Losers overcome fear together
","Revealing the lost youth, which is nostalgic, not colorful and not so spectacular, It(2017) shows the true story being in search of lost time despite some shadows and flaws .I am always indifferent to those inexperienced teenagers who are passionate about doing every thing, but not to the case of this movie.I am fond of Losers' Club for the courage that they fight against the clown. Rather than performing on fleek, they look a little clumsy, even ridiculous (after all, they are not cool people like jocks or cheerleaders in school). However, for this reason, the determination that they show to defeat the clown is amazing and esteemed.I am still afraid of jump scares and heavy sound effects. I wish no clown in the movie so that I could immerse myself in the their childhood despite imperfect. Beverly always comes up to my mind when I am ruminating over the movie. On the one hand, she is still young, but she is mesmerizing and sexy that in her age it suppose not to be one of her characteristics, and due to her sexual attractiveness, she is bullied by others in school. On the other hand, she is bothered by his father over-care monitoring, so she can't relax and feel comfortable at home where should've been safe haven to a child. Fortunately, she comes across Losers's Club. It is a life-changing event in her life. Perhaps some people think that some plots in It(2017) are unexplained, or not clear enough. I, rather, am acceptable to the design and arrangement of the story. Audience could be aware that there should be more stories and backgrounds behind characters. However, it is smart and well-trained that screenwriter chooses to manifest 'fear' the most, and the rest left blank for audience to imagine.So, many people may be curious about Beverly's relationship with her father. Here comes a big question: rape or not? Does her father toe the line?Ensemble cast, in a sense, is a good practice that makes the movie in a nice-paced tempo, in doing so, audience can always be excited and never feel bored.Also, it makes the most wicked antagonist, Pennywise the Dancing Clowndeed, ubiquitous. He can appear everywhere. In other words, fear appears everywhere. I can make a very distinct description of one scene -- all members of Losers's Club gather together watching slides and, all of sudden, the slide machine is out of order, moving through the slides at a breakneck speed......and you know what happen if you have watched the movie or one of the trailers. Brilliant! The best horror movie in 2017!",10,2,4,6 October 2017
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," It is a fantastic novel for kids. Nevertheless, it is a so-so movie
","The opening in the movie is a brilliant fashion to expound upon the background of the whole story - The four children was sent to a shelter where was far away from London raided by air-crafts. The eponymous novel just describes the air-raid in few sentences. The movie, however, extrapolates it and establishes vivid scenes to present, in doing so, it undoubtedly turns up the intensity that makes people believe or get used to shortly.Generally speaking, based on book, the movie succeeds in visualizing the plot regarding to an adventure of four children getting into a incredible world called Narnia in which full of any fantastic creature all you can come up with, such as faun, naiad, dryad and what not. Decent costumes and make-up as well as special effects make the imagination come about. I am not going to praise the movie. It is not a good movie because the book is originally for kids after all. That's why it is somewhat naive and unreasonable for moviegoers so that they probably cannot enjoy watching the movie. Getting through the whole movie, all we can get is nothing else than bonhomie, and too much bonhomie spoil the movie. Audience don't feel nervous at all as Edmound gets caught by White Witch. Audience don't sorrow over the death of Aslan. Audience don't cheer up as Aslan resurrects on account of deeper, ancient incantation. Audience just get through the movie, feeling nothing in spite of colorful and spectacular montage. That's not a movie ought to be.",6,0,1,15 July 2017
Get Out," It is a horror film, but the reality is more horrific
","A film director has a lot of ways to talk about the issue of racism in the United States through dramas (compared to documentaries).Discussing historical events is a common method, '12 Years a Slave', 'Selma', and 'The Butler' , just to name a few.It is kind of distance between audience and this genre of movie taking about black and white, like time and space differences. Most of the time, in these films, villains are more radical, extremely white supremacy, conservative old-fashioned and stubborn, all of which make most audience assure that 'those whites in the film are very wicked, I was not the people alike.'Rather, this time, 'Get out' doesn't repeat the exact same way to process the theme. It is for certain a thriller film, but it is also one such film talking about racial issues. Throughout the film, villains are not the kind that look like whites in the southern United States, but those liberal from Northeast, who look upon themselves as kind people without racial discrimination. That is to say, all those who think that they are not discriminated against blacks can learn a big lesson while watching 'Get out'.'Get out' has lot of connotations, which are thought-provoking, in the script, reflecting the black dilemma in history of the United States. As black people lose freedom and voice so that they can't even protest against unjust system, so are the black people who are hypnotized and whose body are taken in the film.At the very beginning of the film shows a reversal of the routine portraits of black and white in Hollywood films- usually the protagonists are afraid of encountering black people, or walking by the poor slum mostly regarded as black area on edge; However, in 'Get out' here comes a black man walking butterflies in his stomach in the white community. After watching the whole process, I bet some people's heart almost jump out.Sadly, that black guy isn't at all surprised by that, but lament that 'God it really happened to me.' It seems a garden- variety for all black people that they often meet doom in their daily life.For just a few minutes, the director has put the audience into the black people's position.The things that whites do to blacks in the film are nothing but a metaphor of white hegemony that has forced blacks to submit to them in reality.Rose's mother is so-called psychiatrist, and she makes use of hypnotism to repress Chris's consciousness into the sunken-place.She uses exquisite and noble cup and teaspoon. With elegant and noble stir, she skillfully makes innocent Chris give up himself. Chris has no easy way out. After such bad things have been done, Rose's mother is still a educated lady in upper class.'Self-consciousness falls into the sunken-place' is a very clever metaphor, it represents victim can clearly witness the unfair treatment, but can not speak, nor move, much less escape.Recently, in the United States, a slogan 'Black Lives Matter' has come up throughout the black civil rights movement. 'Black Lives Matter' is a goal. There is still a long way to reach the goal. You may cry, but most of the time, crying and shouting are useless, according to the film.After transformation, repressing the real thought, having a big smile, the rebirth black people have all the qualities of white elites in upper class. Who would you think of at once? Barack Obama of course. He was a competent president. Blacks and whites alike are fond of him. Nevertheless, it seems that blacks and whites have yet to reach a reconciliation. Black people still feel that they are excluded, and even in the viewpoint of liberal white elites, they are thought to be the second citizens. How to resolve the problem? There is no easy answer. 'Get out' is a horror film, but the reality is more horrific because the film is fictitious, and the reality is not fictitious.",9,10,19,7 October 2017
The Shape of Water," A process of conversion
","On the face of it, The Shape of Water is a romantic fairy tale for adults, full of many elements, including love, violence, power struggle, and mystery, but that's not the whole story - It is not just a love story. Since we all know that majority of love stories are not amenable, there must be something special in the movie that convinces eligible voters of the Academy to vote for. Elisa, Giles, and Zelda represent the disabled, homosexual and the black, all of whom are marginalized by the mainstream. Sure enough, they are forced to be muted, just like Elisa, compared to the colonel whose two fingers are broken off. Except for these three, here comes a more marginalized one, Amphibian Man.I believe every audience doesn't like Amphibian Man at the very beginning, even feel disgusting on seeing the picture of it. However, during the course of watching this movie, you may gradually recognize it, getting more and more positive impression from the interaction between Elisa and the Amphibian Man. It is kind of a process of conversion. I find it beautiful.",8,3,8,10 May 2018
Halloween," Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere
","To my astonishment, despite the fact that the Halloween is as classical as Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street among horror movies from 1980s, it is less famous as those two in overseas, compared with in US.Nowadays movie fans often find it roughly-making and full-of-goofs. For those who have watched lots of horror movies, the old movie is boring and not exciting. However, we can easily be attracted by its features, which is its atmosphere making a spooky and creepy process as we follow the movie. What's more, Halloween is original, including the idea, immortal masked serial killer. Also, the background music is incredibly terrific. I would say it is a nice experience for watching Halloween. This movie suit especially those who are afraid of bloody scene. Tons of horror movies are bloody. Rather, the pure horrid atmosphere is no other than the backbone of Halloween.",8,0,0,14 July 2017
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Unattractive and Overrated
","Since the new trilogy of Star Wars that Disney has taken the initiative to release, I begin to follow the trend of this franchise. To be honest with you, few people in Taiwan are crazy about Star Wars. Even you conduct an investigation on how many people take interest in Star Wars, the result would flabbergast you. Therefore, I seemingly turn out to be a geek or nerd in Taiwan society where all but nobody goes banana when it comes to Star Wars, even though it is no doubt a pop culture phenomenon in the U.S.This year when I watched a video made by a Taiwanese Youtuber, RayDu, who makes clips to teach everyone English, I happened to watch a clip named Star Wars Trilogy Greatest Quotes from the playlist on the right-hand side, as it was recommending and auto-playing to me. And I found it gripping. Yes, here came like 'may the force be with you' and 'I am your father', followed by a long despondent whine. It was fresh for me to watch a fictitious world like this, so I made up my mind to watch Star Wars. As luck would it be, the latest Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi(2017), was in theaters then, but there was a hindrance - I am used to watching any movie series or trilogy from the very beginning. I decided to watch Star Wars(1977) first, as I came to know there were 8 movies in total at that time( I knew there are 3 trilogies, including 9 episodes). After consulting many posts on the Internet and suggestions, I decided to watch this franchise in the order of 4-5-6-1-2-3-7-8. Episode 4 is Star Wars(1977), with a subtitle, A New Hope. To my disappointment, the movie is not what I expected. And I can't realize why it has become a classic and has spawned lots of works. I think, it is kind of childish so to an adult it is blasé, while to a child it is fantastic. Later on I found it ridiculous that Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) copied, or in other words, emulated this opera soap plot, maybe in homage to the origin of the whole series, rather than make up a new one. C'mon! aren't you imaginative? Besides poor plot, cheesy visual effect, corny costumes, just to name a few, there are tons of weaknesses. After Having watched many such modern sci-fi movies as Inception(2010), Interstellar(2014), Martian(2015), a sci-fi movie made in 1977 is unattractive and overrated.",6,1,7,21 February 2018
Her," A lilting love story between human and operating system
","To be truth, I have watched Her for two times, I feel exactly the same, which is not as stupendous as others would feel, after watching Her for twice despite countless of highly recommendations. The motif of the film is melancholic. However, it can't make me tearful. Anyway, Good film, Good topic, Good conversation. Btw, I love the Scarlet's sexy voice very much.",7,0,0,1 July 2017
Goodfellas," Full of energy from start to finish
","This film is, to me, one of the best mob films. In my mind, it outperforms Godfather(1972) and top all of Mafia films except Infernal Affairs(2002), which is too often classified into 'Cops & Robbers movies' by me. By the way, Infernal Affairs is later on adapted for a new American one, named The Departed(2006), which is, to me, one of the worst films partly because I find it that there is a inconsistency between the original and the remake. And the main reason I dislike The Departed(2006) is, I think, the original is so perfect that any remake that attempt to pay homage to it would be disgraceful. Let's get down to Goodfellas (1990). In comparison with those remakes and fictional stories, Goodfellas is real, of course real because, after all, it is based on a real story. I know, Godfather is regard as one of the greatest films throughout the film history, but it is just make up by a genius, who creates it by making some interviews, intergrating some stories heard from others; while Goodfellas is a wise-guy's life, real life. I love Godfather for sure, and I believe everyone loves it too, as we love romantic legend and epic mythology. However, those stories are far away from us. Goodfellas is more human, less romanticized. I believe few people, as a gangster, could lead a life portrayed by Godfather. Most of us are boorish goodfellas, or wise-guys. That's why I insist that Goodfellas be better than Godfather. After all, we cannot deny ourselves. Speak of the cast of this film, I was familiar with Henry at the first sight of him. I must have seen him before, I knew it. It took pains for me to recall which film he showed up in. At long last, I got a hunch that he supposed to star in Hannibal Lector series, so I got through the cast list of Hannibal trilogy. And Sure enough, he did. He is the one who wants to arrest Hannibal but fails and be one of the toys that Hannibal plays with. Until now, I can clearly, crystal clearly, remember the bloody disgusting scene that in Hannibal (2001), he (starred by Ray Liotta) is probably hypnotized and Hannibal opens his skull, gets a piece of meat out of his brain, and ...... too disgusting to describe furthermore. And he (Ray Liotta) is the narrator and protagonist of Goodfellas. That interests me. From a puppet manipulated by a puppeteer to the narrator and protagonist of Goodfellas. While watching the mob lifestyle in Goodfellas that borders on the ridiculous, his face always reminds me of the fact that he once shows up in other film and be grinded down by someone sinister. And it gives added zest to my pleasure.Tommy(Joe Pesci) is impressive in the film. He does everything big, regardless of outcome. And it makes the film never become a snooze fest. As long as he is in that scene, you always expect something exciting happen, and he always live up to your expectation. With him, there is an unpredictability in the film. I guess that's why everybody considers it a pity when he is whacked by Mafia despite the fact that he is such a rude guy. Come on, the film is not a solemn moral lesson. Joe Pesci is awesome. No wonder he wins an Oscar. He totally deserves it. Basically, the whole film consists of many fragments of daily life, including eating, drinking, sex, party, robbery, fest and what not. Nevertheless, every fragments are interesting enough to keep you focus on the film, and even immerse yourself in being the part of Henry's special life. Colorful, literally and metaphorically, life. A great deal of lively moving shoots, as well as a bunch of classic 60's and 70's Rock 'n Roll music, make the film, despite the long running time, full of energy from start to finish.",10,0,0,16 February 2018
