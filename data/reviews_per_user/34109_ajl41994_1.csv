The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Completely Blew My Mind
","I just got the book for Christmas and since seeing the movie, can absolutely not wait to read it. The film centers around a freshman named Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is recently trying to move forward from his best friend's suicide. Upon starting high school, step-siblings Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) introduce Charlie to a whole new world full of people, relationships and adventures while on a journey to discover who he really is. I knew this movie was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THIS good. The screenplay is brilliant and all of the performances are terrific, particularly Ezra Miller's. Stephen Chbosky appears to have adapted his novel brilliantly and the soundtrack is magnificent too (you'll know what I'm talking about once you watch the tunnel scene). If you haven't seen Perks yet, definitely add it to your list. You won't be disappointed.",9,1,2,25 December 2012
