The Avengers," Well done!
","OMG Scarlett Johansson looks good in tight black pants!! OK, enough of that. This is as good a translation of comic book to film as any of us are likely to see - ever. Each of the actors chosen for the roles draws their character on like a glove, and the fit is perfect. This is what separates The Avengers from most other movies in this genre - the characters have depth, their interaction with each other is real and eminently believable, and the willful suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy this type of movie is so effortless as to be unnoticeable. The CGI effects are spectacular, as is to be expected, and kudos to the designers for some really over-the-top bad guys and hardware. If I have one minor quibble, it is that I wanted more from Colbie Smulders as agent Hill. Her screen presence is so intense that I kept waiting (and wanting) more from her than to just be Samuel Jackson's aide-de-camp. Ah well, maybe next time.",9,14,28,26 May 2012
The Hunger Games," A pretty good adaptation, with one huge exception....
","Let me begin by saying I am most definitely not the target audience for this movie. Even so, I read and enjoyed the first book (my wife writes YA fiction, so I try to keep up), and was quite happy to take my two teenage granddaughters, who are the target audience, to see it. While not quite as brilliant an adaptation of book to film as some - the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes immediately to mind - it is still a worthy effort. Worthy in most respects, that is, with one glaring exception, which I will get to in a bit.First, the good points. The film is a faithful adaptation of the book, with a few minor changes that mostly work. The differences in the two media require different handling. What can be explored at length with the written word must be compressed, implied or, in some cases, made obvious in the visual world of film. The reader's imagination, which is the writer's best friend, becomes the viewer's preconceived notion, which can be the filmmaker's worst enemy. I felt the film did a pretty good job of translation. In general, the casting and characterizations were good. I have long been a fan of Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson and Stanley Tucci, and they didn't disappoint. Jennifer Lawrence was a pleasant surprise - I was unfamiliar with her work, but the young lady can definitely act, and her portrayal of Katniss was eminently believable. I had a bit of a problem with Josh Hutcherson as Peeta appearance-wise, but setting that aside, overall he acquitted himself well. Elizabeth Banks created an absolute gem of a character with Effie Trinket.Some have complained that the film sanitized the violence which is such an integral part of the book. I disagree - the violence is there, it is just implied more than explicitly shown. This is a perfectly respectable, although currently little-used technique (consider the murder scene in the original 'Psycho', for example) and was necessary for the PG-13 rating the film required for its target audience. Costumes were good, settings were good - some, like the Capital, were superb, and one - the control room - actually improved on the book. Overall, pretty good marks except for that one glaring flaw ....The camera work was awful! It intruded, it interfered, it irritated, it gave me a headache, dammit! The hand-held jitters and the constant rapid-fire jump cuts were just too much for these tired old eyes to handle, and seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the film. If not for that, I would have scored the film a couple of points higher than I did.",6,1,8,6 April 2012
The Imitation Game," The dramatic performances are excellent, the historical accuracy leaves much to be desired.
","I'll check the 'spoiler' box just in case I inadvertently include one.Benedict Cumberbatch may come to be considered one of the best actors of his generation. I would agree with that.Considering the script he was given, he did a masterful job of portraying the tragically complex character of Alan Turing. Sadly, the script did not do justice to the character or his singular achievements in helping to break the Enigma code and that contribution to the allied victory in WW2. The rest of the cast was equally outstanding.Several reviewers have objected to the sympathetic portrayal of Turing's homosexuality as 'having an agenda.' Society's very unsympathetic attitude towards homosexuality at that time is integral to the story, particularly considering what was done to him by society in general and the British government in particular after the war. That part of Turing's life was portrayed with a reasonable degree of fact. The rest, not so much.I base my review rating on the performances of the cast, and the fact that any telling of this story is better than none.As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the writers, directors and producers really need to go back to school.",8,0,0,16 July 2015
Footloose," Not as bad as it could have been, but not as good as it should have been.
","In general, I'm not a fan of remakes; if it isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing. 'Footloose 2011' is 'Footloose 1984' with a different cast, some additional (and mostly unnecessary) back-story, and a few minor plot changes. Unlike the original score, the 'updated' music was mostly pretty forgettable, even the covers of the songs from the 1984 movie. In the 1984 version, Kevin Bacon pretty much carried the show, with an able assist from Chris Penn, while Lori Singer was along for the eye candy. Bacon wasn't a dancer (Peter Tramm was his dance double)and Lori Singer's dancing was at best merely adequate, so director Brewer's idea of casting two professional dancers as leads in the remake seemed like a good idea - he was half right.Kenny Wormald is an excellent dancer and certainly looked the part of Ren, but he lacks the charisma that Kevin Bacon brought to the role. His acting is adequate, but that's about it. I didn't actually dislike him as Ren, but he didn't do anything to make me particularly like him, either. Julianne Hough, on the other hand, was a very pleasant surprise. She is a beautiful woman, a superb dancer, and (here is the pleasant surprise part) shows real promise as an actor. One of the things that makes her such a delight to watch (besides the obvious physical attributes) is that when she is dancing, she looks like she is loving every second of it.In reprising Chris Penn's role as Willard, Miles Teller came pretty close to stealing the show a couple of times, especially in the sequence where Ren and his two young cousins are teaching Willard how to dance.For a movie supposedly all about dancing, there wasn't nearly enough. What there was of it was nicely choreographed, in some cases a step-for- step recreation of the 1984 dance scenes, but shot with a confusing mishmash of close-ups, very awkward mid-range shots and not nearly enough long shots that would actually show the dancing instead of just hinting at it. When I left the theater after seeing the 1984 film, I couldn't get the music out of my mind, I was humming 'Let's Hear it for the Boy' for weeks afterward. Sadly, not so this time. I'll give Julianne Hough and Miles Teller B+'s for their roles. Overall, I give the production a C+.",6,0,2,9 March 2012
