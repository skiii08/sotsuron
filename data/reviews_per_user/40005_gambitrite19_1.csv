Skyfall," New 007 movie creates Intrigue for the future.
","Skyfall is a pure CLASSIC BOND movie. The First thing that came to my mind before watching the movie was 'What is Skyfall??' But i was not disappointed as the question was answered in an intrigue style. There are lots of spoilers and mysteries. This is the first 007 movie to answer all the questions which we had been guessing all these years. This Movie requires a lot of patience and the casual movie goers, expecting lots of oomph and gadgets will be a bit disappointed.On the verge of completing 50 years for the Bond films, Sam Mendes has done a marvellous job which has to be visualized with your own eyes. Daniel Craig's best performance upto date as we see a lot more than action scenes or the cool, composed international spy with the deadly,cold stare. Judi Dench aka M has given the best performance when compared to other actors in the movie. She has shown us exactly what M is capable of during the crisis faced by MI6 and the decisions taken in a very cold brutal manner. Equally worth mentioning is the Main Antagonist, Javier Bardem aka Raoul Silva who shows us a Cold War style espionage which baffles our mind. Not to forget that Ralph Fiennes has a great responsibility which we could probably guess.The Film gives us a Fresh look into Bond's personal world, British Pride and a Stunning view of Scotland. Aston Martin DB5 - the sound of the engine revving made me wonder why don't we have such wonderful beasts?? The Bond Girls are a hit-miss affair.The movie is a reminiscence of spy vs spy with most of the actions in the 'SHADOWS' with a mixture of haunting silence and pure 007 gun barrel sequences. Threat of a cyber war and Resurrection of Bond in a old genre style is a treat to watch. This movie gives a wonderful basement for future 007 ventures.If not for the slow pace at certain parts of the movie, I would have given it 10/10. I give 9/10.",9,4,14,7 November 2012
