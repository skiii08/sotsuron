Blade Runner 2049," There Are Fashion Trends I Enjoy And There Are Those I Do Not
","Blade Runner 2049 was always going to be an uphill struggle for all involved given how the original 1982 film is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, that description itself means it was inevitable that Hollywood would come around to making a sequel as soon as all the rights, royalties and personal conflicts are resolved.Starting with what I like (aside from the original Blade Runner of course) in this world I can say as a fairly average man I enjoy cleavage, female legs and short skirts. I also like Chinese food, cool sci-fi and walks through downtown mazes.Things I do not like are, er, sequels and prequels (yes, you guessed it), Italian food (all those carbohydrates) and Hollywood's other latest fashion (aside from the water hose spraying sequels) of making films two hours+ without reason (other than lack of editing capability and self control). It is so sad that they all follow the same pattern.BR2049 did not have the purpose, meaning or acting to pull itself off and came across as another forced Hollywood sequel to make money pretty much. There were a couple of interesting scenes, but mostly it comprised of revelations without meaning or reason and meaningless and boring scenes (like a hologram of Elvis wasting my time) that should not have been there in the first place.Personally, I will not be attending the sequel to this (they already ruined Blade Runner though), Star Wars 8 (that one really needs boycotting) or the remake of Your Name they are shooting. Hollywood only understands one language.",Null,7,13,21 November 2017
