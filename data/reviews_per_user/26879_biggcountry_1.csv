The Equalizer," For Mr.kahl's intro into films classðŸ˜Ž
",The equalizer is a fantastic movie about Denzel Washington(McCall) Who is a hired gun or was a hired gun for the government we don't fully know in this film and we don't truly ever find out what he was before we see him For the first time we just know by the way he takes care of 'business' that he doesn't mess around. If you haven't already seen this movie in theaters you need to go down to the store and buy it right now!The equalizer is a pretty straightforward movie no twists and turns no mystery nothing but blood and action. This movie is a gory movie and it has been rated properly so if your thinking of taking your nine-year-old son to go see this movie don't on the other hand I'd say if you're more towards the age of 12 and up depending on the parent this'll be a great movie to go see with some friends. I love this movie and I think you'll love it too I give the 10 out of 10 stars.,10,0,1,29 October 2015
