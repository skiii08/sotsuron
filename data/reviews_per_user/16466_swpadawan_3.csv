Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You've got to see this movie!
","I missed The Phantom Menace in the theaters, I thought it would be a bad movie. Was I wrong! After a few months I decided to rent it. It is a great movie! There is a lot of light saber swinging in T.P.M. After Christmas I bought the Dvd. Let me tell you, it has tons of extra footage (over 600 hours worth).Plus three different menus (The Pod race, Queen's royal starship, I forgot the 3rd one) I can't wait to see Attack of the Clones!",Null,0,0,19 March 2002
Home Alone," FUNNY!
","This movie is really funny. Especially when Kevin fights with his family, he thinks they are a bunch of idiots (especially his brother Buzz). When he is left at home he gets in Buzz's room and messes it up. He lets the spider out, by accident.I always look fwd. to watching Home Alone 1 & 2 (the third Home Alone movie is a joke. :/) during Christmas or whenever it comes on t.v. it never gets old its still funny!  I recommend that you buy it or at least rent it.",Null,0,1,20 March 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," GO SEE ATTACK OF THE CLONES!
","I just saw this movie a few days ago! You have to see it, there is some major butt-kicking in this Episode. I'll tell you this, Yoda has a little surprise for you. If Jar-Jar Binks is the only reason you are not going to see this, well, He is only in the movie for a total of 3 minutes and he is no longer a 'goofy' Gungan. There isn't too much mushy stuff.",10,0,0,20 May 2002
