Captain Phillips," Most Tedious movie in recent times......big spoiler
","This was the most boring, pathetic film ever. Two hours or so of SteadiCam wobbliness and Tom Hanks as the most ineffective cowardly Captain ever seen in film. All he did was stare and look pathetic...acting was non-existent. Someone on this site said he was sleepwalking - that pretty much sums it up. After 40 minutes of pirates running around the cargo ship, and the crew hiding in fear, we were ready to watch American Pickers. Thanking our lucky stars we didn't shell out big bucks to see this yawner which should have been a one hour TV drama......Obviously this was made to satisfy some studio deal, because it was just a nothing film. Too bad Hollywood spews out this stuff today instead of making films that uplift and/or entertain. What could have been suspenseful with good dialogue and interesting characters, was instead ho-hum. Unlike Hanks' great film 'That Thing You Do' which was about one hit wonders, this film is a one note blunder.",1,14,40,6 January 2014
Gone Girl," Sad Commentary on Film Today
","Thought this would be a good thriller, but ultimately it was draining and depressing. Would think any man who sees this film would never want to have sex again......it portrayed woman/women as being monstrous and men as passive, sex-crazed zombies. The story had so many loose ends and unbelievable scenes, such as where she returns home covered in blood.....then she's at the hospital - there had to be an exam, then giving an interview to detectives, then comes home still covered in blood....how much time elapsed during these scenes, and who would allow her to drive around, carry on, covered in blood for all that time? With great emphasis on crass words for women, violent sex scenes, and a score that sounded like a synthesizer importing screeches from an airport runway, this was one depressing film. The only place it was believable was in its depiction of the media and how they revel in tragedy and perversion. If this becomes our prime form of entertainment we are in big trouble. Need to watch a pre-1960 film or musical now.",1,274,490,23 October 2014
La La Land," Tepid, Overrated Oeuvre
","**Big SPOILER ALERT** Was looking forward to this film, but had to watch in agony from its beginning as a Pepsi commercial to its ending as a Coca Cola commercial. Shocking that this pallid film is being feted for something it is not. Emma Stone, someone who is hard to watch in long extreme closeups throughout the film and Ryan Gosling exhibit no charisma or charm. Their dancing tries to be cute and romantic but is clumsy. The music is dirge-like and not uplifting. The producers should have used more professional musical performers, ones who can inspire when they sing and/or dance. Gosling talks about jazz throughout the film, but we hardly hear any good jazz, especially not the jazz greats he talks about. So how are we to know what is the great jazz that inspired him? His friend says 'Jazz is the future.' But in reality it's the present, being created as it's played. All of a sudden, Stone, the aspiring actress who shows no acting talent whatsoever, decides to become a playwright without showing any ability or work, except for having an apartment covered with photos of classic movie stars. The banal dialogue, superficial characters and overly long scenes are embarrassments. Stone comes into her old coffee shop and asks for two iced coffees. Immediately a guy standing there puts down a tray with two iced coffees in front of her. Glaring continuity problem there. Throughout the film in almost every scene there is nary a person who is over thirty. The casting people never cared to hire people who reflected the real world, fantasy or not. If the music had been tuneful and clever, the film would be somewhat better. As it is it is dull. he characters exist in a vacuum with no backstory. Only interesting aspect to this film is some of the recognizable Hollywood locations, but locations do not a film make. If anyone still watches the self-aggrandizing Academy Awards, it will be cringe-worthy if this film wins any awards except for production manager or art director. It's a sad state of affairs that this film is considered in high esteem. That accolade belongs to 'Singin' in the Rain,' 'The Band Wagon,' 'Gigi,' 'Oklahoma,''South Pacific,' 'Top Hat,''Wizard of Oz,' and films by Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Miller, Charisse, Garland, Crosby, Sinatra, Grable, Keel, and all the great stars who truly were musical comedy class acts. Their talents made even B films a joy to watch.",1,196,393,1 February 2017
The Holiday," Two woman find love by exchanging houses
","Of the three Meyers films, 'What Women Want,' 'Something's Gotta Give,' and 'The Holiday,' 'Holiday' is the least creative and fulfilling as a movie. If you like Cameron Diaz, it's great, but for people who don't find her particularly attractive or a good actress, it's tedious. She was cute, but not an interesting character and it was hard to have empathy for a rich, spoiled movie industry person who is so unhappy and silly. Jude Law was wasted in this film. He looks great but his character is shallow and there is too much talk throughout about how 'complicated' they and their lives are. Kate Winslet is wonderful in this film but is cast aside for Diaz and Law. Jack Black, although not a leading man, is given his first chance to be one and is quite acceptable. Ms. Meyers runs out of ideas when she steals a scene from her earlier and superior film, 'Something's Gotta Give,' where Diaz does a less funny crying scene while trying to write, which Diane Keaton did so expertly. While I could sit through that film with its compelling characters again, I could not watch this one a second time. Choice of songs, as ever, adds to the drama, and the ending is taken straight from the great film, 'Holiday Inn.' I surmise this was the reason for its title, 'The Holiday.'",3,25,68,23 November 2006
Fifty Shades of Grey," Sad commentary on Film today
","Luckily did not ever pay to see this 'film' but it is on cable TV often much to my shock. If ever there was a low-brow soft porno film, this is it. The acting is atrocious and wooden. Nothing really happens except the woman is abused and pilloried throughout by a nauseating man who is supposed to be sexy, but is the antithesis of it. This picture brought filmmaking to a new low. It is so sad to see films like this boring piece of rubbish when we think of the golden age of Hollywood with its wit, humor, drama, inciteful writing, direction, editing, music scoring, everything that came together to make great films. The fact they are making a third version of this sick story is unbelievable. I hope no one goes to see it. What's next, soft-core snuff? Shame on the 'actors' who portrayed these perverted characters....their careers might never recover. Minus '1' is the rating it deserves.",1,1,3,3 July 2018
