Mission: Impossible III," a leave your brains at the door actioner...
","MI III was your typical summer action blockbuster movie. A leave-your-brains-at-the-door kinda movie. It tries to pretend it's a James Bond movie in fact! If you like brain-dead action movies, go see it. If you like looking at Tom Cruise, go see it. If you like a lot of pyrotechnics, go see it. If you wanna see Cruise in another o.k. movie, go see it. But if you're looking for a movie that uses 1 spec of your brain, don't go see it. Philip Seymour Hoffman is o.k. in this movie. Fishburne reminds me of M in the James Bond movies, and Simon Pegg reminds me of a Q. MI III is o.k., it will keep your attention, it has a lot of action, but it doesn't have a lot of plot. Cruise acts like Cruise, he doesn't act like Ethan. I'm glad this movie came out first, just to get it over with. I never had any high expectations for it considering I'm not a huge fan of the movie trilogy.",5,9,18,5 May 2006
American Pie," a great movie!
","I saw this movie last night and I rolled laughing in the isles. If you don't like shocking sexual movies, don't see this, if you do, it's a MUST!  If you love comedy and don't have anything up your butt, then it's a must see!!!!",Null,0,0,12 July 1999
American Beauty," WOW!
","My fiancee & I saw this movie at a sneak preview showing in her college. The big lab building was filled with mature college students, and there were those who still haven't grown up yet.  The lights dimmed and the movie started.  It started out with Lester Burnham (played by Kevin Spacey), in a short monologue with an overview of the city they live in.  From that moment until the ending credits rolled, I did not blink, I did not budge...except when I laughed...and BOY did I laugh.  The movie itself was a bit....shall I say..oh...weird.  My fiancee didn't like it too much, cuz it was too weird for her.I thought it was a very serious movie, but with most of the serious scenes, it contains lots of humor.  That's why I thought this movie was very good & original.  It's very very serious, but at the same time, it was hilarious and shocking.Please do NOT take your kids to this movie either (like I saw some parents do in American Pie), it's very BOLD & BRAVE.  It has Kevin Spacey nearly commits statutory rape, it has Spacey masturbating (it actually showed it!), and it had Annette Benning having sex with Peter Gallagher..<very rough hard sex>.  In short, I think Spacey & Benning & Chris Cooper (the Neo-Nazi marine) all deserve oscars for this movie!   As for best picture, as of right now, there's no movie as bold, daring & very well acted like this movie is.  So, American Beauty, you have my votes!",10,6,10,24 September 1999
The Green Mile," a great movie!
","It amazes me sometimes...a perfectly POWERFUL movie like The Green Mile & yet, there are some that just don't like it.  The acting is top notch, the directing, the screenplay, everything is top notch.  Answer me this..or better yet, e-mail me a scene you think that can be cut out of the movie & it will still make sense.   Every detail in that movie is vitally important to the plot.   I liked Shawshank, but I went into the movie theater with a clear mind..I didnt expect to see Morgan Freeman or Tim Robbins come out of a prison cell. :)It's a great movie & I hope it gets nominated...SPECIALLY the big black dude that played John Coffey.  In my opinion, if you have a firm grip on what life is all about..you'll love & fully understand this movie...if you don't know what life is really all about and what lies ahead...you just won't understand the movie.",Null,0,0,11 December 1999
