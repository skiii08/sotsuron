Minority Report," Very predictable sci-fi thriller
","Too many things in this movie are predictable. It really destroys most of the pleasure, when it comes to watching an otherwise interesting movie. Almost from the start you can figure out how it will end, and where the plot will take you. The result is no more than a couple of hours waiting for the inevitable. The movie is well made, however. Interesting plot, good effects, coherent music and good acting. But just what is that worth, when you know what will happen?  Well, I can't give it more than 3...",8,0,0,30 September 2002
The Bourne Identity," Not nearly as good as the Robert Ludlum novel it is based on
","In fact I think the film is too regular. It is not loyal to the book, giving a lack of punch to anyone who has read it and experienced Jason up close and personal...The casting is okay, but not excellent. I never imagined Jason would have the shape of Damon. Many of the spy-thriller details from the book have been erased completely from the movie leaving it as a rather dull product, merely made to entertain at a moderate level. The sound is turning it's back on you. The music is not too good and the sound effects are almost boring.
If you liked the film, however, I can certainly recommend the book!!!  It has a lot more to offer.",5,1,2,3 October 2002
Saving Private Ryan," Ethics, emotions and politics are not always at peace with one another...
","Steven Spielberg. That name should almost be sufficient. This film is a masterpiece when it comes to showing the brutal sides and consequences of war. How much should an individual pay for the freedom of his or her country?   That is an essential question here. The film starts in the present day and ends there as well. The majority of the action takes us back to the days of WW2, where the mouth of a gun made most of the political statements. If you're into war, it doesn't come much better. The casting is excellent. The sound is very realistic and I recommend seing the movie in THX or surround. The length of the movie helps to create the right atmosphere. It doesn't stop, when you think you were just getting started. You should experience this movie rather than listen to what I have to say about it!   If you can take the heat of the shells and bullets falling all around you...There is nothing like a movie, that dares to make a statement and puzzles you with the consequences of it!",9,0,1,23 September 2002
Trainspotting," Heroin, heroin and more herion; and the dire consequences of that much heroin...
","This film deals with one of the world's most abused drugs, heroin. We get to met some persons, whose lives are ruled only by drugs. Their lives are about getting a fix and thinking about how to get enough money for the next. The film has been made with a lot of creativity in order to illustrate what effect heroin has on our organism. The atmosphere is everything in this movie. Expressions, experiences and exertion related to the drug. It is in short a tragic, but entertaining portrait of the world of a drug addict. Surely worth watching.",7,0,3,23 September 2002
