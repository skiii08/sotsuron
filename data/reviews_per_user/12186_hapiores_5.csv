Casablanca," good
","Casablanca was a mystery to me until a few weeks ago. Somehow I never felt great interest about it, although I'd heard for a long time that it was a great movie. Now it's difficult to explain how I feel about it. I understand why it is a great movie: the actors, the background, the characters, the storyall of that. Although it was not a 'love at first sight' the movie left something in me. However  and I must apologize to those that are true fans of the movie  when I started thinking about it I felt it was very difficult to appreciate it to the fullest, simply because of it's age. I know this has more to do with me that with the movie itself, but the format, the direction, the acting, well, the structure of the movie, is very related with it's time (obviously). This is not a critic, just something that I'd noticed for a long time and now had the opportunity to express: most of the movies below a certain date (for me maybe 1970) report to things that a younger generation has some difficulty apprehending ( it was in the mid nineties that I became more aware of the movie world), mostly because what was interesting and new 60 years ago is not necessarily so now. This feeling is more about all the other movies than about Casablanca itself. It's very natural to see it, without thinking it's an old movie; somehow it feels right. Only with Citizen Kane have I felt the same. Of course it's remarkable that so many years after it was made it still holds something special. About the restwell, forgive the relief.",9,1,2,30 March 2005
Control," Behind a name
","It's surprising what a name can hide, what a word defines and what it leaves out. 'Control' brings some light to late vocalist Ian Curtis, the man itself, behind Joy Division.What is often spoken is that he had a tragic death at the age of 24 with a suicide that ended a rather complicated life. Not being a true fan of J. Division and not knowing what it was about i was surprised by the young boy hiding behind that name, trying to find out his way through live the best he could. His youth mirrors every aspect of his life, from the impetuous choices he made to the early marriage and fatherhood or the passionate/silent relation with Annik. That's the center key for the whole movie, watching a young man trying to shape itself, trying to grow, coping with life, becoming aware of choices and trying, just trying, to be in control. All of this with a troubled personality. The black&white cinematography works perfectly to portray the dismayed dormitory cities in England's 1970's, pure urban voids where nothing interesting seemed to possibly grow; and surprisingly the background for cult bands of that time. It seems he never left those places.",8,8,14,25 November 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Jesse James
","Epoch Movies sometimes fall into a pit, where the mechanics of moving back in time has more to do with showing characters dressed in the days of old and portraying social poses than conveying a genuine epoch feeling. This is of course arguable since the spirit of a time now dead is impossible to show; but maybe it can be emulated, suggested more than defined - and of course, the more vague it gets the more dependent it becomes of the viewer's own predisposition do see it, understand it or 'connect' to it. For me 'Jesse James...' works at this level portraying with accuracy something both palpable and vague that transcends the curiosities, the costumes, the surface of what we see  the spirit rather than the materiality; very intimate, passionate and yet strangely detached. These were the men of the days that are gone. The awkwardness of those days bursts in the beginning, as a strange locomotive fills the the dark woods with light, and this synthesizes the overall mood for the picture: the direction, the cutting, the photography, the actors - and their meager lines -, are in a perfect unison.I remember 'The Proposition' and the parallels that can be traced between (appart from Nick Cave): both movies use a similar visual technique, with long shots of the wilderness, small lines, subtle score and loose editing. The big difference is perhaps the voice over in 'Jesse James...', a narrator that works almost like an historian and brings us closer to the characters and their inner feelings.Brad Pitt has good leading role  the best in the last years  looking a matured actor, and Casey Affleck has the first big opportunity to show what he's got  and he delivers.",9,4,9,30 January 2008
The Dark Knight," Unexpected and amazing
","After Spiderman's debut super heroes' movies have reached higher and higher, leaving the childish tone for which they were known throughout the 80's/mid 90's, to become complex productions, in a path similar to that followed by the comic books from the early 80's on, giving a depth to the stories and characters until then unknown. Batman the Beginning followed this trend and was already a well balanced picture, rooted in a sense of reality that made it distinct from it's contemporaries. The Dark Knight is one step beyond.Continuing the saga of Gotham's most known hero, The Dark Knight begins where it's predecessor had left: by now both Batman and Bruce Wayne know exactly what role they must play and the movie opens in full speed, with an intricate fast tempo, showing all the characters and building the plot from the very first frame.In the end it's simply impressive, the sheer sense of completion the movie has - something that puts it miles away from it's predecessor - which is partly explained because of the great script (the brothers have proved to be an excellent team in past movies: Memento, The Prestige) and the methodical shooting C. Nolan uses.The way the characters move in a perfectly real emotional landscape gives them an unexpected depth, from Batman to the Two Face, or - obviously - the Joker. Heath Ledger is perfect in the role of Joker and the character becomes simply daunting, the first time ever that the joker is not a silly sociopath, but a truly dangerous man, devious in everything he does and yet brilliant in his own game: the fact that he chose Harvey Dent to go after is the best example of his meticulousness; and he wins (remember that it was his intension to swap the addresses of Harvey and Rachel).",10,8,17,3 August 2008
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," The woman and the queen
","With a view clearly centered on the woman behind the figure of the queen, 'Elizabeth' is a passionate portrait of the XVI century. The court, the costumes, the social hierarchy and procedures are thoroughly depicted showing both the richness and darkness of the time. The queen (Cate Blanchett) is the main character, showed intimately, almost striped before our eyes. She starts as a monarch and with the pose one would expect from her. And yet soon we see that there is something more to that persona: the loneliness, the sense of duty with the lack of freedom it implies, the desire to love and simply be loved in return; to be loved by what she really his and only that. As she lowers her defenses and allows Sir Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen), a charming pirate with news of a world she has never seen, to come close, we could almost say she was only a woman during that time; no title, no obligations, pure will to be what she feels like. However the intrigue around the crown rushes in, the plot thickens, and the woman is set aside, giving room for the queen. It is after this, when it comes to the end of the movie, that something changes. Our intimate view of her character is lost and instead there seem's to be a little twist, as the overall feeling of the movie changes to that of an epic. In the final shots there's almost a deification of her and it's hard to believe it. And most of all it's less interesting because the woman behind the 'queen' is more captivating than the idea of the 'queen'.",7,22,39,25 November 2007
