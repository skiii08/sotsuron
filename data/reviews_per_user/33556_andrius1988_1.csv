Requiem for a Dream," Just don't do drugs, for Christ's sake
","This incredibly shocking movie tells what is the end of a man doing drugs. It shows all it could be showed about that life and it shows it extremely realistic. There are 4 characters, who somehow became addicts: Tyrone, Harry, his mother and girlfriend. They all do drugs, they all have hallucinations but their fate is different.Tyrone finishes as a jail worker, Harry ends up losing his arm because of the blood infection, his mother is being tested by some 'alternative methods' of medicine, because she lost her mind using pills, and Harry's girl does some porno to get money for drugs. The final scenes of the movie are very shocking. They show the doom of the addicts.. Shattering scenes I must tell. However, anyone somehow interested in drugs should see it. Afterall it's a great movie",10,0,1,9 April 2006
