Deja Vu," Extremely entertaining movie, although probably impossible
","I wasn't exactly sure what to expect when I walked into the UCLA sneak preview, but boy was I glad I went.First off, what surprised me most about the movie was how sci-fi it was. I thought it'd be some supernatural phenomenon regarding deja vu, but it's really not, and even though the story they try to spin is fairly far fetched, it sounds cool. Don't try to analyze it afterwards either because you'll probably find some hole and then you'll think its dumb. Just watch, don't think. Overall though the story was pretty easy to follow.The cinematography was beautiful too, very stylish. The action scenes were intense and very realistic, similar to Tony Scott's other movie Man On Fire, which I thought was pretty good too. Deja Vu compared to Man On Fire? I think Deja Vu wins... but only by a little tiny bit.Denzel Washington is GREATTT as always. Val Kilmer is slightly weak in his role, but not to the point where it's painful to watch. He's also gained some weight... and has a weird bump on his neck. As for Paula, I haven't seen her in any movies before Deja Vu, but she is pretty convincing as well, and not to mention HOT. Acting overall was solid.The ONE thing that peeved me was the extremely WEAK love story that they tried to weave in. No. That's all I have to say.Long story short, go see it when it comes out. It'll be worth your money. 1337",9,23,49,17 November 2006
