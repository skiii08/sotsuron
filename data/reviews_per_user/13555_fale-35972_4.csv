It," Not particularly scary, but ok
","Fine actors, can't wait for the second chapter. The music was fine, the characters, and all, and although it didn't have a backstory, we didn't need one.",7,0,1,15 July 2019
Captain Marvel," Pretty decent
","It was ok in the end, even if it started a little strange. I loved the way Carol switched alliances and loyalties when she found out everything!",8,1,4,28 April 2019
Avengers: Endgame," GREAT
","Absolutely great! Loved the storyline, the acting, everything! I gave it 9 stars though because the hole 'changing the past does not change the present' is nonsense! The time travel makes no sense, but I loved it anyway :)))",9,0,3,3 May 2019
Schindler's List," Ok
","I would've loved to see more action, more blood. It was ok, though",9,0,3,12 May 2019
