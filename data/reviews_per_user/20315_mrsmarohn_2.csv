Angels & Demons," AWESOME Movie
","I got to see this movie two days before it came out in theaters though a local radio station. I would have never thought that I would have liked this movie, but it kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. I am not one to actually talk during movies but I would catch myself saying 'oh, no' and 'no'. I didn't think that I would even know what was going on since I have never seen the Di Vinci Code. I was sure that I would be like where did that come from, or who is that person. But they done a really good job at not referencing the other movie very much. One thing that I didn't like was it almost seemed like the Catholic Church sponsored the movie, and me not being catholic it was hard to follow along with some of the traditions. There were so many twist and turns and just not expecting what was going to happen next.",10,7,19,14 May 2009
The Last Song," The movie was lacking
","I was so excited to see this movie, and even though I was on my way to the hospital I had my mom get it out of the mail box for me. I finally got to watch it today, and I have to say I was very disappointed. The screen play was written before the book so I thought that Nicolas Sparks would have used more of what is in the book for the movie, but I was really wrong. The two main characters in the movie need to learn how to act. It was so obvious that Miley Cyrus has never experienced real life or the loss of someone very dear to her. Also, it seemed like the guy who played Will was only interested in the kissing in the movie. Another disappointment was how the character of Marcus was portrayed. It could have been so much better, and more like the book where he pretty much stalked Ronnie. The actors that played Jonah and his dad were awesome. In short the movie could have been so much better if Mr. Sparks had taken some of what he had written in the book and put it into the movie.",3,7,10,8 October 2010
