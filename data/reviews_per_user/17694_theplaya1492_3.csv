The Graduate," sick movie
","Hi, my name is Nick Altomare and recently I watched the Graduate in my history of American cinema class at Hudson valley community college. This movie is great and I enjoyed it a lot. It was one of my favorite movies all semester. The acting is funny and amazing it captures real life emotions that I could see happening to me. The shots and scenes used are very eye catching and the scenery is beautiful. The view in the movie is very dynamic. Being from a younger generation I was admiring everything Benjamin was doing. People from an older generation would view it as disgraceful. This combating view is what made this movie so popular and good at the time.",10,0,0,24 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Spectacular movie
","Hi, my name is Nick Altomare and recently I watched Singing in the Rain in my history of American cinema class at Hudson valley community college. This was the first comedy musical I ever watched. And I loved it. The use of dancing, singing and comedy is very entertaining. All the actors are professional and exhibit their skills very well. I like how this film was made and incorporates lots of different scenarios and scenes. The use of cameras at pre-determined locations makes for a steady flow and up close and personal feel. It's very connecting and inspiring to watch. In my eyes it's a hands down American classic and all around great movie.",9,0,1,24 April 2014
