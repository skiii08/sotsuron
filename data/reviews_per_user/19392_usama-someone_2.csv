I have seen this film about 7 times completely and repeatedly and even than I can see it again and again with all of my close friends no matter how many times.Such films are made very rarely and by extreme luck and can never get old as several greatly positive roles are shown in it to stop evil men from torturing common good weak people specially ladies who cannot defend themselves as men can",10,3,5,7 February 2016
