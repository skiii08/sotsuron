The Hangover," Not a good film.
","If you've liked Very Bad Things you will definitively not like this movie. 'Hangover' seems like a bad copy of that film.This film was recommended by a friend of mine, saying he 'laughed his way through the whole film'. I assume that his humor tastes are more middle-of-the-roadish or maybe he had a similar experience in Vegas, so he could connect to the ridiculous events on screen. I think, I laughed twice.I don't think this film should be in the top 2000 (lest alone in the top 250). There must be something very wrong with the rating system on IMDb.If you choose your movies based on ratings on IMDb, make an exception for this one. Rather re-watch Very Bad Things or Fear and Loathing.",1,11,21,15 October 2009
