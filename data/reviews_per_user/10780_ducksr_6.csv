Catch Me If You Can," Original and flawless.
","Catch Me If You Can, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, is an extremely entertaining film, and absolutely lovely to watch. DiCaprio plays the well-known fraud Frank Abagnale Jr., and Tom Hanks plays the FBI agent Hanratty who's chasing him, and they both deliver great performances, DiCaprio in particular. Being based on a true story, this movie develops into a roller coaster of fun, and one of the truly great films of 2002. Even though the movie may seem a little slow in the beginning, there's never a boring moment, and I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films I've ever come across. It swiftly made it's way into my top 10 movies, and I will watch it again and again.An original and great movie, with flawless acting and direction. Definitively one of the most entertaining movies of all time, it never gets dull! 8/10",9,2,3,28 August 2004
Se7en," Greatest thriller of all time.
","This movie is so unbelieveably good. If you like thrillers, this is a must. It's actually even better than 'Silence of the Lambs', and a little bit more shocking. Brad Pitt & Morgan Freeman are excellent in their characters, and Kevin Spaceys outstanding 'input' in the end is absolutely awesome.The first time I saw this movie I was so impressed, I just ran down to the videoshop and bought it. You simply HAVE to watch this movie, it is so well-acted, well-directed and has an exceptional script. 10/10 - a masterpiece",10,0,1,8 September 2003
Troy," Decent, thanks to Eric Bana's great performance.
","Troy is mainly about the warrior Achilles, played by a mediocre Brad Pitt, and the battle between Greece and Troy, but it is also about vengeance, love, pride and sacrifice. The acting in this movie is not great, but some actors deliver fine performances. This includes Eric Bana in particular, but also Brian Cox, Rose Byrne and Sean Bean. Brad Pitt is good most of the time, but he delivers some of his lines badly. I usually do not like Orlando Bloom's acting, and sadly this is no exception. I enjoy most of his movies, but he is by all means no great actor. The battle scenes and the special effects are good, but the movie is missing something. It leaves you satisfied, but nothing more. It's pretty clear that director Wolfgang Petersen wants something more with this movie, but he seems a bit unoriented and confused. But the movie is still very entertaining, and it is by all means no bad movie. To put it another way; it's worth a look or two.7/10 - Could've been better if certain things were changed.",7,1,3,19 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Too predictable
","The Day after Tomorrow is a movie with good special effects, but unfortunately, that's it. Roland Emmerich once again proves that he is very talented when it comes to special effects, but very incompetent when it comes to everything else. Godzilla and Independence Day are two other examples of this. They both have excellent special effects, but a bad script/dialogue and poor acting. Dennis Quaid is the only actor in this movie who delivers at least a decent performance. The rest of the cast is horrible, and doesn't act believeable at all. That was a huge disappointment.5/10 - Emmerich keeps making the same mistakes every time.",5,0,0,28 May 2004
Dumb and Dumber," Great comedy, a classic to me.
","Dumb and Dumber is about the two losers Lloyd and Harry who live in Providence. Lloyd works as a limo-driver and Harry works as a dog-stylist or something like that. One day Lloyd drives a woman named Mary to the airport, and he falls in love. But Mary 'forgets' her suitcase on the airport, and of course Lloyd runs in to get it. Mary told Lloyd that she was going to Aspen, so of course Lloyd and Harry heads out on the open road to Aspen to bring her suitcase back.Most of the jokes are very original, and both Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels deliver awesome performances. This is a movie you can see again and again, and never get tired of it. I'm sure I've seen it over 20 times (seriously), and I laughed every time. One of the funniest I've ever seen, if not the funniest.A comedy classic, which deserves a much higher rating than it has.",Null,0,1,11 June 2004
Tombstone," Good, but not nearly as good as 'Wyatt Earp'.
","This movie was great, but I do not think it was as great as 'Wyatt Earp'. Kilmer was really good as Doc Holliday, no doubt about it, but I think Dennis Quaid was better. Same with Kurt Russell, I think Kevin Costner was more of a 'Earp' than Russell, though Russell had his moments.I really can't figure why so many people think this movie is better than 'Wyatt Earp'. This movie was pure entertaining to me, and 'Wyatt Earp' has something special, which both inspires and entertains. Maybe it has something to do with that 'Wyatt Earp' seemed a little bit more realistic than 'Tombstone'.Good and entertaining movie, but if you miss it, it's not a disaster.'Tombstone' : 6.5/10 'Wyatt Earp' : 9.5/10In other words, if you're interested in the story of Wyatt Earp, rent/buy the Kevin Costner-version.",Null,0,1,5 September 2003
