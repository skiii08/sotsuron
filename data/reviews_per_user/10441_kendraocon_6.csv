Casablanca," Not as good as I expected!
","This movie was not as good as I expected it to be. I think that the cinematographer's moves were great though. He had a lot of techniques involved in it. He used a tilt shot, showing the plane in the sky then the camera was tilted to show the men and women watching the sky. I thought it was a nice move, it was missing any pieces there because it was a nice clean shot. They use low key lighting, were the shadows were almost over emphasized. The women were highlighted and shown in a beautiful way, especially Isla. They also made sure she didn't have too many harsh shadows on her face. They had the perfect tonal range in the light, that helped show the emotions of the characters the best. The director had used a lot of minor characters , which confused me a bit. I was confused between Rick and Victor, I found that there was not much a strong difference between the two of them that really stood out to me.The cinematographer always used the best techniques to show of the characters, in the beginning showing off Sam in the restaurant they start off at a far distance, but then gradually zoom in almost as if it is a slow motion shot of Sam singing and playing the piano.",7,1,4,11 October 2012
Citizen Kane," Really good movie!
","I thought Citizen Kane was a really well written movie. The movie kept you interested the whole time, he didn't seem to repeat much of the same techniques or types of scenes which I thought was the most interesting about it. There was definitely some odd point of views and perspectives, but this movie was odd in a good way so therefore it worked. When they first started off the movie, they showed the body of Citizen Kane, I liked perspective of the camera, you were aligned with his body. They also were showing newspapers of Kane's death, with an added voice. I liked the scene were all the men were gathered in one tiny room trying to find out how to publish his death, with the light seeping in from the windows hitting causing a outline of light to hit their faces and heads while the rest of their bodies were black or dark. You don't know what rosebud is and either does anyone in the movie, I liked that point of view. The light in this movie is just awesome,they used low key lighting. They did a crane shot when they were introducing Ms. Alexander, I like how they changed up the camera angles and did not keep it at just plain old eye level. With the mystery type of movie, I think the different angles, perspectives, lighting and other techniques just made the plot even stronger. I also loved the lighting in the room in the Walter Parks Thatcher Library, it looked like light beams were shining down on the floor and the man was very confined in there, with just a long table and a chair. You really understood Mr. Kane with all of the flashbacks of his life, they brought you back to his childhood and you could sense how much this child would change. I thought it was interesting about the flashbacks and that they were through other peoples eyes and not Mr. Kane, they were still sharp and very clear to understand despite them being from someone else's eyes.",8,1,2,19 October 2012
The Graduate," Great Movie!
","I thought the director was great and the cinematographer also! The techniques were just awesome and they kept you interested! They had many interesting shots and perspectives, it kept the movie more interesting. For example the one shot of Ben through her legs goes along with the context during that time. The shot of her body aligned with Ben's face with the quick switch of shots made it look like she had a hole in her body. The pool scene with Ben in the scuba shot, was the best scene of the movie because of it was all through Ben's eyes you could see everyone/ everything as he was seeing it. It was his point of view of the people at the party. When the camera is in the closet, it starts off with it being lit with the open door and then suddenly changing when she shuts the door. They did a montage shot of Ben different days and sometimes different locations, but mostly in bed.",8,2,2,19 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Good Movie!
","I thought this movie was pretty good! I thought the different technical things that they used were new and different from some of the other movies, making it separate from other movies more.This movie was full of musical numbers and dancing scenes, they added new angles and interesting perspectives. They shot each individual dancing scene in a unique way, in a one of the scenes that they had a montage of scenes in a quick moment. One particular scene with Kathy and Don dancing on stage, the perspective and angle isn't consistent, it switches up from close up shots to scenes that are farther away. In the Singing in the Rain scene, the do a pan shot of him walking along sidewalk. The use of the Technicolor was very cool, and it worked for the movie and I think if certain scenes were not in color it would not show the same effects.",8,1,2,27 November 2012
Pulp Fiction," I thought this movie was pretty good
","This movie I couldn't really tell what lighting they used, I think it was low key. There weren't intense shadows, so maybe some of the scenes used high key lighting. The lighting seemed like natural window light, not artificial lighting. They use interesting angles and perspectives in their scenes. The hamburger scene for example, the the angles and perspective are switched to the black man to the white man, to the burger to many more. The low angle of the black man I think was done to show the power and control he has over the white man and that he is much stronger and larger then the small white man sitting down. The car shot of John and the black man, the camera angle switches back and forth to both men talking it doesn't show both of them in the same shot together until the scene is almost over and even then one is not in the focus.",7,0,2,19 December 2012
Psycho," It wasn't too bad
","It definitely wouldn't fit under the musical or romantic category in my opinion with the blood and violence. It starts off with the switched angles, showing the woman looking at notebook, to woman's face to just the notebook, to just her face again, it is keeping the movie from appearing boring.The angle of the shower, not just the woman in the shower, but the actual shower. It shows the woman getting in feet first, showing the floor of the bathroom and then it shows the side and front view of the water spurting out of the shower head. it is keeping our eyes interested in what will happen next. The low key lighting is very intense at times, it creates this eerie feeling. For example the black outline of the killer and the eerie haunted house, the back lit lighting behind the black makes it more eerie and scary.",6,1,2,19 December 2012
