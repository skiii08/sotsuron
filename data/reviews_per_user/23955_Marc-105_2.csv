The Sound of Music," Excellent syrup
","The Sound of Music is an excellent movie, but one with big problems. First, the good news.  Director Robert Wise, who's had an awesome career, is in top form:  the movie is very well made and looks terrific throughout.  The opening sequence is truly wonderful, with the beautiful Julie Andrews singing at 10,000' without gasping for breath.  Christopher Plummer is good.Much of the music is good.  My favorite numbers are 'Do, Re, Mi' and 'The Lonely Goatherd.'  Both are staged very well and are extremely hummable. Here's a fantasy of mine for 'Do, Re, Mi.'  Part of the number is done along a road with a white fence.  The fence has five horizontal rails, which reminded me of the staff on sheet music.  The kids should have been positioned on the fence like notes on the sheet music, matching what was being sung.  But they didn't do that.The wedding is impressively staged.But you come inevitably to the flaws, mostly ones of sentimentality.  The song 'So Long, Farewell' is awful.  And its staging is bad.  At the end, when all the dinner guests wave good-night to the kids, I want to throw up. 'Maria,' though tuneful, is a dumb song.There are soft spots in the cast.  Eleanor Parker as the baroness is stagy. Charmian Carr as Liesl is stagy, and particularly bad in the dialogue leading up to 'You are Sixteen' at the gazebo.  She had a deservedly brief film career, making only one other movie, and it was for TV.Let's not forget the plot.  This pretends to be a true story.  But ... the von Trapps did not flee Austria one step ahead of the Nazis, climbing all those mountains (with the grass waving due to the helicopter carrying the camera) -- they just left.  So all that stuff after the music festival is fiction.  I believe, but I'm not sure, that the Nazis did not try to force Capt. von Trapp back into the armed forces, either.As good as Julie Andrews is (and I'm a big fan), there are some awkward moments.  After she runs back to the convent in the beginning, she runs past this group of nuns, and does a lousy double-take when she's caught.  Then she gives a bad speech about how nice it was in the country, '... and the sky was so blue ...'  It rings hollow.  Much later, her speech to Peggy Wood explaining why she left the von Trapps and returned to the convent is weepy and sounds forced.But in spite of the flaws, the movie is still a winner.",Null,5,15,23 July 1999
Brokeback Mountain," A masterpiece
","(Written 12-23-05.) I've seen this movie twice. The first time, I had expectations that it would more erotic and sadder than it turned out to be. I cried a bit at the end. Then I saw it again a week later, and haven't been the same since. If I think or talk about Brokeback Mountain too much, I start crying (so far, six days after seeing it the second time). I probably can't be objective about the film because I'm in love with it, for all the reasons you'll see in the other comments: awesome acting, an extraordinary script, and direction that brought out the best in both. But more so because of its emotional impact. I have never had this reaction to a movie. If you feel lonely (as I did) before seeing the movie, be prepared.This paragraph is written on March 6, and I'm still shell-shocked from last night's Oscars. (I saw the movie for the 11th time on Saturday.) I realized this afternoon how angry I am: not giving BBM the Best Picture Oscar is in the same ballpark as making My Fair Lady without Julie Andrews. They are the two worst things to happen in the history of movies. Maybe last night's tragedy will fade in time. I don't mean to trivialize the snub of BBM by this comparison, but my anger is comparable.Consider a couple of other times when the Director and Picture Oscar were split. In 1967, Mike Nichols won for directing The Graduate, which I remember vividly. Does anybody remember In the Heat of the Night? A less exceptional example is 1998, when Spielberg won for directing Saving Private Ryan, and Shakespeare in Love won for Best Picture. Yes it was good, but nowhere close to Saving Private Ryan. 1972 is a counter-example, w/ Bob Fosse winning for directing Cabaret and Godfather winning Best Picture.Five or ten or twenty years from now, BBM will be remembered for the landmark and masterpiece that it is. Crash will be almost forgotten. Some other thoughts on the movie after so many viewings. Ledger's and Gyllenhaal's acting is some of the best I ever expect to see. I'm still stunned at--among other things--how good their (and everyone's) accents were. Just about every word sounded perfect throughout the entire film. And Gyllenhaal does a lot of good acting w/ his eyes. A friend, contrasting Gyllenhaal's previous movies w/ BBM, gave credit to Ang Lee for bringing out Jake's talent. I suspect the same would apply to what Ang Lee did for Heath's performance. Both of these guys are under 30, and it's a scary pleasure to imagine what kind of careers they have ahead of themselves.Finally, let me put in a plug for the trailer that's on the Brokeback website. In its way, it's as good as the movie--a masterpiece that makes me cry. The music breaks your heart. Ironically, I haven't seen it in a theater because I'm always there to see BBM.",10,55,72,23 December 2005
