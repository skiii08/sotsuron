Sucker Punch," Amazing Storytelling
","First, like many others, I love the story, fight scenes, cinematography, and of course the babes.Second, I read only one other reviewer that actually understood the story fully. I don't say this to feel superior. I would not have seen through the many layers when I was younger and it took several viewing to pick up on all of it You may agree or disagree but watch it again after you read this...The story was entirely about Sweet Pea and Babydoll only existed as a figment of Sweet Pea's imagination or as an alter-ego. Remember I asked you to watch it again.Watch how the movie literally opens...it's a stage. Sweet Pea is narrating. When Babydoll enters the 'theater' in the asylum, Sweet Pea is on stage dressed as Babydoll, and acting out being lobotomized. Toward the end, Dr. Gorski mentions that she accidentally killed her sister in a fit...Sweet Pea certainly had a 'fit' when Rocket was killed and who else would they blame it on?There are so many clues throughout the movie but finally at the end it is blatantly obvious. Babydoll was introduced as being 'for' the High Roller and she must attain her freedom before she meets him. Of course it is revealed that the High Roller is the doctor who performs the lobotomy. You might not want to hear it but Sweet Pea was lobotomized and that was her escape. As she is getting on the bus, she sees the boy who was the English soldier from the WWI fight scene board the bus and her Angel or 'The Wise Man (Scott Glenn) was the bus driver. Both of these characters were introduced by Babydoll who was Sweet Pea's ater-ego.It is so rare to find this depth of story in an action movie. While I did not want such an ending for Sweet Pea, she fought for her freedom. When she could not find it in the literal sense, she embraced freedom of another kind.It's not the classic happy ending but tell me, when is life the happy ending you imagine? You fight for what you want and when you don't get it, if you are smart enough and strong enough you make the best of what you were able to achieve through your fight. Few of us get fairy tale endings and I applaud anyone who is brave enough to continue fighting to make what they get work for them.Sucker Punch certainly makes my top ten list and I have been around long enough that only one other action movie is in the top ten with it. Watch it again...and again. You may even start to question if everyone else was real... I hope this added something to it for you rather than ruin it....that is certainly not my intent.",10,2,2,4 July 2020
