Blade Runner 2049," A sequel we deserve.
","Feeling a deep sense of awe in almost every frame of blade runner 2049. I would like to think, that this is how audiences felt back in 1982 looking at these spectacular visuals for the first time (I seen the original blade runner in the cinema a couple of years back and I felt it even then).The sequel blade runner deserves it continues with the massive themes, about our existence and such. While taking it on a new path, influences are in there from different sources but this feels like it's own film. It also feels unique despite numerous attempts at sci-fi world building this decade alone.  It takes its time and thank god for that. You really get a sense this was the film, the creators were wanting. A bold blockbuster in an age where fast paced/quick cut edits are all you see in big budget blockbusters.  Blade runner 2049 was a delight.",10,6,14,13 October 2017
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," A slight disappointment given whats gone before!
","The Mission Impossible series has only gotten bigger since its inception on to the big screen 20 years ago opening with Brian De Palmas smaller scale slick and intense thriller where we are introduced to Tom Cruise's secret agent Ethan Hunt. John Woo then steps up the action with MI2 Slow-mo shots galore and full of the directors trademarks which work ever so well in Hard Boiled but fail Massively and is a miss-step in the franchise. JJ Abrahams directs the darkest in the series to date , portraying a more vulnerable Ethan Hunt and for my money has the best villain of the series in Phillip Seymour Hoffman. 2011s Ghost Protocol yet again ramps up the action to good effect with some of the best action set pieces of the series bringing on board Brad Bird in the hot seat and seemed to revitalize the flailing franchise.Rogue Nation is the fifth installment. The IMF has been disbanded and Ethan Hunt is now an outlaw for the C.I.A. The team have their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the syndicate - A rogue organization helmed by Lane (Sean Harris) committed to destroying the IMF.Full of blistering well done fast paced action as to be expected but I don't think it has moved the franchise any further, now more than ever in the Tom Cruise show has become a series of massive action sequences that could be shown in any order and it wouldn't make a difference. Nothing quite matches the stunt on the Burj Khalifa, here it seems to be a nuts and bolt affair which makes it mostly tension free which is a disappointment.Christopher McQaurrie does a fine job in the directors chair but the screenplay is so-so. McQaurrie seems to be able to direct over the top action with his eyes shut one of the best in the business in this genre (The Way of the Gun is an underrated classic in action cinema). Which is why it's hard to take that MI:5 is lacklustre in almost every other aspect with the exception of a couple of great action sequences.Same old, same old for the crew here Cruise the unstoppable machine with some spectacular and daring stunts which he indulges in more than ever, Simon Pegg's Benji the comic relief which for me grated at times, The ever tough and stolid Brandt (Jeremy Renner), Ving Rhame's Luther cool as a cucumber as always. A new face in Rebecca Ferguson for my money (Acting wise at least) is the star she absolutely convinces in her role and you as the viewer are never quite sure what sides she is really on.There is certainly a lot of value in here for action heads it just seems for me at least to be getting somewhat stale don't get me wrong I do like it as it is one of the better franchises out there. It's the same old and that's all good if that's what you are after get some more suspending wires and tapping on laptops mid-air. Worth checking out but for me was a slight disappointment . It adds nothing new for the audience maybe it does for Cruise personally film by film outdoing himself stunt wise. As a spectacle it's decent but not the best in the series.",7,3,5,30 March 2016
Kong: Skull Island," Don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight
","As far as big blockbusters go, Kong: Skull Island is not half bad. The first 30 minutes or so pass by and plays out in typical fashion, the soldier stereotype as seen in countless films meat headed with a gung ho mentality. Which in essence is a moral of the film 'don't go into someone's house and start dropping bombs unless you're picking a fight'. The first 30 mins despite the roaring action is pretty dull, the CG graphics are pretty spellbinding the detail on Kong specifically.Not until John c Reilly turns up was I fully invested and in all honesty he steals the show. He provides a couple of dazzling lines and weirdly enough injects some much needed heart into a so far emotionless ride.The music was good except it suffered from the 'suicide squad' syndrome it was over used almost to breaking point. An excellent use of Jefferson airplanes white rabbit can always be forgiven though. Kong references a whole bunch of other films some obvious choices, others not so obvious. Ranging from music cues (the shining, fear and loathing in Las Vegas) then to some more on the nose Vietnam flicks ( apocalypse now, platoon, full metal jacket)Never tries to be smart and plays Upto the ridiculousness of the story to good effect. In all honesty I've never seen a Vietnam pastiche quite like it. For the most part it's extremely enjoyable and there is tons of fun to be had.",6,22,42,9 March 2017
Alien: Covenant," Maybe they should stop here, before tarnishing the original!
","The alien movies over the years have mutated manifold from straight up horror to a full on war/action flick then to a mixed backstory starting in alien 3 which was interesting but a massive failure. Prometheus visually stunning as it was was let down by an awful script an dialog in particular.Where do we come from? Why are we here? Themes from Prometheus continue in the very first 5 minutes before the credits have even rolled. It continues to beat you over the head with its backstory which, for me makes no sense whatsoever. Some of the dialog references other master horror works such as Frankenstein but does so in a way that it's up its own arse. Forgetting what alien actually was in the first place, a coincidence that was never about back story. Characters explain the plot in basil exposition speaking like no one ever would - speaking their thoughts at every opportunity - yes we get it, it treats the audience poorly.What I did like was the scene shown much in the trailer, a character trapped in concealed room as something happens to her colleague. It was a longer scene that was tense and exciting and I oh so wish the rest of the movie could have come close. In a strange way alien covenant takes iconic moments from the franchise and tacks them on here but makes me wish I was watching alien or aliens instead. It's technically good as always Ridley Scott is a visionary filmmaker, but is unable to turn a weak script into a good film.Alien:covenant gets locked up in its own self importance while forgetting why we loved alien in the first place. I really wanted to like it but came a way with a huge sense of disappointment.",5,211,412,14 May 2017
