Frost_Nixon," Balls vs. soul
","I hope it will not spoil your experience. It might though.In this Howard's excellent film Frost jumps to the opportunity to interview Nixon as a vehicle to move from semi-tabloid journalism to a life time challenge. Va Banque... The supporters/collaborators in this hoped by them to be an ambush/last ditch attempt to try Nixon had a chance to bring the man they considered to be a disgrace to the country to some justice. Again, in this film, as it is supposed to be in the best creative products, Integration defeats the Splitting. Frost and his crew are making their best effort to defeat Nixon and to put him on trial. They succeed - only to produce so much sought by them admission by Nixon of his fallibility and insight he lacked before. His experience during the interviews (especially the last one) brings him to the realization of his faults and seem to generate regret. Bingo! ... Yet - triumphant Frost and his team succeed glamorously and financially, but Nixon seems to retrieve his conscience and awakened his soul. His initial triumph of suppressing Frost's spirit by slamming him down and castrating him focusing on his effeminate shoes turns around and leaves him on the receiving end of his own creation. Yet - as it is supposed to be - an acquired feminine essence seemingly imposed on him brings about greater humanness and spiritual maturation he achieves as a result of a defeat - as it supposed to be. There is a very significant theme of Jack Brennan (played by Kevin Bacon) and homo-emotional relationship between him and Nixon. Loyalty/devotion/admiration and support curled into a pretzel of serving the idol withstands the confrontation, but at the end he is not present. Disappeared. Dissolved by the defeat of the idol? We don't know. Nixon is alone. No one of significance is around. Just effeminate Italian shoes... The circle is completed. Castration ricochets back and slashes the balls of the castrator whose action has produced the sequence.Only to make the castrated one more human and real...effeminate...as it supposed to be.",9,4,9,14 December 2008
Star Trek," Nice, silly, thrilling ....
","Mish-mash of all the 'space/action' films and TV programs - from even pre Star Wars flicks to diluted, flattened and impoverished Blade Runner, Matrix etc. Yet - engaging, thrilling, adrenalin pumping ...gobbledygook - shallow, violent, tacky ...yet - uplifting, exciting, gripping, infectious ... It will break all the Box Office records, but it's lack of: common sense, any meaningful futurological or simply logical content - neither deserve a second look nor a first listen.... Oh, well - what else is new? We love mindless entertainment and this one fits the bill. What can I say? - I felt satisfied and empty minded. Worth the time and money. Well done, Abrams et al.",6,2,9,10 May 2009
Incendies," Greek x Shakespearian tragedy
","Not what you 'believe', but what is believable. Eternal truth - our ability for good AND evil. If you want to see this in 4D (such thing must exist)- see also Waltz with Bashir.The most important part is - the life being so much more bizarre than fantasy.This film shakes you up to the core. Whether this is a 'true story' or not literally makes no difference. It is a metaphor on ANY hateful relational process, but especially on so called 'religious' confrontations.Take facial tissue and don't be embarrassed by your tears.",10,6,15,22 February 2011
Watchmen," Watch out men ... and women ...
","Now we finally know - there is a God and his name is John. Even for the childlike adults, who have a history of involvement and identification with 'superheros' and maintain this interest in adulthood the movie about them, probably, should have been an animated one. So many people liked this film. I am flabbergasted. If it was done in keeping with comics style, or had a more meaningful story - that would be different, but with live actors it makes it 2hrs 42 minutes of gore and sheer nonsense.I am not and never have been a buff of comic books and such. So, if you are, nothing I can say to you. If you are not - stay away from this rubbish. How would you like to observe an impotent Superhero? Or how about sex scenes where the couple of superheroes makes love, but the intercourse is so lame and basic that you get bored watching it? Again - I am not a comic book fanatic. Not even versed in these matters, but pleeeeeease,if you are in the know,explain to me what the redeeming value of this might be?",1,6,20,5 April 2009
Knowing," Close Encounters ....Apocalypse....whenever. Independence Day. Even Noah's Arc!
","1% of the Close Encounters; 0.5% of the Apocalypse and 98.5% of the Independence Day with a dash of Childhood's End by Sir Arthur C. Clarke. Not to forget - around the rim spices of the Noah's Arc - rather peculiarly minimalistic, but nevertheless... - still not an alcoholic beverage. But not awful.Entertaining. Some rather good cinematography. Too much of elements of horror movies.The ending is really silly - preteen Adam and Eve ... pleeeeeeaze. And those rabbits... oh, those rabbits... That's not what Sir Arthur C. Clarke had in mind writing his Childhood's End and publishing it in 1953. (As a matter of fact this is a nifty occasion to spread the word about the goodness of this book.)If there's nothing else to see...well... it might be worth your while to go see this. But then again .... who k n o w s ???",4,1,3,28 March 2009
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Why?
","'Burn after reading' multiplied by 'The limits of control' and divided by 'Syriana' + many other films. Absurdism parading as humour and becoming an absurdity itself. Lured by the star studded cast - George Clooney, Jeff Bridges, Kevin Spacey - one finds himself watching those stars floundering in a poor slap-sticky script. It's alluded in the beginning of the film that they know something about the real mind control research and developments funded and conducted by the Government. And then they show this clownade. Upsetting.Government bureaucracy (not unlike in 'Burn after reading' ) may and needs to be scrutinized and criticized, but just making mindless and awkward fun of it isn't really worth the effort.",2,5,17,15 November 2009
Get Out," '..would have voted for Obama a third time if they could have.' My foot!!
","Despite being an entertaining and well played by actors + skillfully structured by the director and the crew, it is a terribly biased and divisive film. There is no even one positive white character. Not even neutral. Just black (good/victim) and white (menacing/racist/predatory...etc).Besides, the medical/neurosurgical premise is ridiculous. Although, it's not that important. Some reviewers, gullible and well meaning, overlooked this central point and effect of the movie. These 'people' would vote for Obama?!Pleeeeease.",1,87,177,13 March 2017
The Hurt Locker," The man gotta do what the man gotta do...
","Predictability is necessary even in a suspense - paradoxical, but ... predictable. In a handful of episodes depicting the diffusion of bombs and explosions, the palpable anxiety and tediousness of the process does make sense. A couple of these episodes are somewhat contrived, but still, the character of Sergeant William James fits in them perfectly.(Some 'urban legend' types of 'macho' statements are made usually along the lines of a 'Real man has to live like he is not afraid to die any moment'. For that there is a come back 'ninja' type: 'The REAL man should act without fear as if he is already dead'. Neither of them have anything in common with real life.)People usually can't explain their behaviour - they just do whatever they 'gotta do'. How to show it in a concise and simple way? Kathryn Bigelow does it rather well. Three main characters illustrate the bell curve of an average. In the middle there is Sergeant JT Sanborn and on either side of him there is Sergeant William James, (the 'ninja' type) and Specialist Owen Eldridge on the other. He shows more fear than Sanborn, who is too proud to give in to the natural sense of self-preservation - although he reacts 'normally' and appeals to common sense when James behaves in a manner which can be perceived by others as bravado. Yet, having eight hundred and thirty seven bombs diffused in his (we don't know how many) tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, what other attitude can we expect from him? In his predictably short stay at home with his 'family' (a masterful stroke of the writer - divorced wife living with their son in his house - 'So - what does it make her?') he utterly doesn't fit in to any other environment but the one in which he has grown into like a toenail: the road side bombs environment.It is an important film and, although not perfect (definitely not 'the best film of the year' as the leading comment suggests), it brings home some of the realities of this and any other war. Adrenaline and other hormones pump on both sides and they find themselves in a choreography of circumstances, relational obligations and attraction. Yes, the attraction of war. This film is an illustration of what wars do to the character and the soul of a person.",7,2,5,26 July 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Some things shouldn't last....I had to leave in the middle.
","One of the writers titled his comment 'I was just thinking about how nothing lasts...and what a shame that is...' Nothing lasts for reason - and it is not a shame at all. I am almost 76 y.o. and should last as long as can function and quality of my life is acceptable for me and my family. I am wondering how they have finished this chain of tedious, pointless, disjointed episodes. When this film will play on TMN I shall record it and fast forward. I couldn't stand it any longer. Old Daisy was lingering and lingering and I believe I was not the only one thinking: 'Please die already'. Abundance of made up emaciated ancient faces. Mocking some old man with his stories of being struck by the lightening 7 times (miraculously not repeating any of them). What was the meaning of all of it? I apologize if my unfortunate experience offends some people, who derived any emotional, artistic or other value from this film. After all I didn't see the whole thing. When Benjamin, who just acquired his proper last name, came to see Daisy with bouquet of daisies - that was toooo much and I couldn't stand it any longer as I said above.",1,29,58,11 January 2009
Taken," A cookie-cutter miraculously creating a paradoxically unique thriller.
",Excellent entertainment AND an emotional relief despite the fact that practically ALL the elements are the recycled moves and takes from Bond and Bourne movies. The difference is that love for a daughter - so genuinely performed by Neeson and staged/edited by Morel and his crew - makes the watching experience so griping and charged. Although the superman's abilities are pretty unbelievable (not unlike in the mentioned above other ones') - you watch it with absorption and participation that makes you almost jittery with excitement and suspense. That's another paradox - in a predictable in practically all the aspects film - suspense. What a miracle creativity presents! The other somewhat subtler line is relationship between Brian and Lenore charged with anger and regret - and back to anger. His work vs. his family life. His regret and guilt for not being there for his wife and daughter. As trivial as it might be - the line has been literally in the thousands of films - it creates the charge that propels the story development into a paradox of cookie-cutter elements composing a quite uniquely emotional thriller.,10,4,7,8 March 2009
Avatar," Out of body... yet in the gut experience
","'Avatar' is not just a movie. As such it would be rather weak and declaratively inept. If you think it's about environmental issues, perils of corporate greed etc. ...it is not. If you think it's about good guys vs. bad guys  it is not.It's an experience. You are immersed in a whirlpool of images and gut responses. If you are a mature male and find yourself surprised that tears are rolling down your face, it means that you got it. It's a rich and emotional experience. I have seen it twice in regular 3D and then in IMAX. That was yet another enhancement of the intensity of the immersion into the world of 'Pandora' with its intertwined interconnectedness of the living beings of Flora and Fauna comprising the united divinity of Life.Cameron seems to lift the name 'Pandora' and it's natives from the Russian sci-fi authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky. From The British Guardian newspaper: The Strugatskys call their world Pandora, and it is warm and humid and heavily forested. So is Avatar's alien world. The books take place in the 22nd century. So does Avatar... In the books, the natives of Pandora are called the Nave. Avatar calls its aliens the Na'vi. More from the Guardian: Strugatsky, 76, appears to have shrugged off suggestions of similarities between Avatar and his Noon Universe, and denied reports circulated that he was accusing Cameron of plagiarism.This is not that important though. Avatar is a phenomenon and, in my opinion, everyone should see it.",10,2,5,7 February 2010
Crazy Heart," 'My name is Jeff and I played alcoholics before....'
","And he played them well. Here he is too very good. So are all the actors and the director. The theme and the depth though .... This moving picture not that much of a film. It's a touching story with redemption. So is a/the theme of the son abandoned and unobtainable now vs. almost adopted one, lost, found and lost again ... Corresponding, as well, with his process with Tommy. That all was a little too much. But the picture's sentiment appeals to everyone. It helped me to better control my eating tonight. Honest.For those who love and know well country music it must be a real delight. Some people applauded after it ended.For others it definitely worth to watch,... if there's nothing else. There is no risk. You will not necessarily regret it.",4,4,9,16 January 2010
The Reader," The glass is 1/2 full AND 1/2 empty.
","This film is such a masterpiece of Integration vs. black and white Splitting of more or less subtle categorizations by a culture with villains vs. heroes that any attempt to explain or describe the magic of Reality as it is presented in it would be equal to trying to explain the meaning of a poem without reading it. So, go see it. My accolade here is not going to be a spoiler. You can't have too high expectations. If you allow yourself to embrace the material, you'll be fine. The book was written by a German of the generation of sons and grandsons of those who actually lived in the country which was ripped apart and humiliated after the defeat in WW I. (The War that was cheered and welcomed by many prominent German intellectuals of the time, including S.Freud and T.Mann). The country, which in the 1930s was 'raised from its knees' (expression coined by V.Putin pertaining to contemporary Russia). This euphoria of newly acquired power and toxic demagoguery of a bunch of psychopaths, which was eagerly soaked by a population hungry for self-respect and 'stability' (another of Putin's propaganda terms) twisted the usual (tenuous as it is) moral fabric of the society and desensitized the whole country. How the characters acted appears to be natural - albeit not approvable by hindsight and conventional morality. Everyone is guilty and everyone is a victim of seemingly inevitable circumstances. Some redeemed themselves in a 'third meaning' way. Watching this film I felt such a cathartic sadness.... You ought to allow yourself to be open to this profound presentation of our so called 'human nature' and be prepared to take it in and let it make your tears flow. Cry your eyes out my fellow humans...",10,5,8,13 December 2008
Mother!," Pretentious as 'Black Swan', 'Pi' etc
","Some people even liked this shshtaff. I believe that for some of them it's a result of projection coming from their personal history. Others are afraid of appearing not sophisticated enough - 'the new emperor's clothes' type of phenomenon. I should of looked at the info. If I knew it was Aronofsky's b a b y (Err), I would've saved 2 hrs, CAN $11.50 and myself from feeling disgusted.",1,21,37,17 September 2017
Bull Durham," The tastiest cookie on the plate....
","The baseball cookie cutter production in the film industry has variety of the widgets on the plate. This romantic/erotic comedy is a love story with a baseball backdrop. It is so juicy and tasteful that it is worth your time and money to watch.The main characters are performed very ably by the trio of very good actors. The following is not a spoiler: Listen carefully to Crash (Kevin Costner) machine-gunning his life credo to Annie (Susan Sarandon). By now you are going to see it on DVD or cable TV - so you can always play it back and listen carefully. Great tirade, well written and delivered.",9,0,2,1 February 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," I got my money back
","Brilliant technology. But what good does it do if the content is hollow and foolish. I have left after < than 30 minutes of watching, being bored and irritated. The theatre administration returned my money, but the time waisted and aggravation remained. I have been had and no thanks to the stars whose names were the main attraction. George, Meryl, Bill - I hope you were well paid. You might have even liked it. So I apologies for my limited mind. A lot of people seemed to like it too. Look at the comments. Oh well...Wish to know - what is remotely redeeming in a story about Mr Fox the husband, the father, the citizen, the ...whatever.",3,8,32,29 November 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Tastefully melodramatic hymn to human dignity, love and devotion.
","If you mix couscous with prunes, yogurt and nuts - try it sometime - you ought to add some cyan peppers. Lushly entertaining romantic, cliché and yet so outstanding hymn to a human spirit, devotion,endurance love and adherence to Destiny. It squeezes out of you all the emotions and tears you are able to produce. In owe of the dignity and simplicity of a character forged in the squalor of physical, moral and emotional ordeal of a life  the viewer is enveloped in compulsion of compassion and respectful admiration of integrity and humanity of Jamal's nature. I was somewhat worried about the Bollywood factor, but it was minimal and necessary. An entertaining masterpiece.",10,2,5,10 January 2009
Up in the Air," Is grounding possible for a flake?
","Most of the comments on IMDb contain the story line. I don't think it is necessary or advisable. But sharing your personal experience and analyzing it from the vantage point of your subjective reality could be enriching potentials of perception and preparing the one who didn't see the film yet. Equally it may give the confirmation of their own feelings, or a totally different angle to the one they had. Naming who is playing whom is not necessary either - it's all on the title page.I would have given this film 10, but still can't figure out whether the predictability of the most dramatic moment in this film was necessary or not. On the one hand it gives the viewer a sense of bitter satisfaction ('I knew it!'), but creates a feeling of double disappointment and sadness on the other.The film is about and soaked in the existential essence of life commitments vs. self-absorption and detachment. The cruel process of severing people from their lifeline - firing someone from their job, depriving them of their livelihood - coats the sometimes literal executioner in an almost sadistic aura of impotent or inevitable omnipotence. The skillful HR consultant type who specializes in terminating people's employment flies around in business class comfort as a utilitarian Angel of Death personifying the vampire-like nature of his source of wellbeing through the process of taking it away from others. Isn't it a circular conspiracy of the 'everybody against everybody' nature of our culture? The earthiness of the texture of life, family, partnership, sharing, empathy and consistency (the grounding of a human being) is too real for this individual, who can't afford it - otherwise he can't do his job. Imagine the surgeon feeling the pain, fear,and anguish of the patient. How long will he last?The film is full of the paradoxes of life - fake vs. real; commitment vs. separation, abandonment and betrayal; discovery vs. loss.Good and timely for the contemporary society masterpiece enhancing our appreciation of life process. I wonder if, at least for some while,the rate of the weddings will rise and the divorces - diminish. Hilarious comedy/drama too.",9,1,10,7 December 2009
