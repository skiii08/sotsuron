Skyfall," Puerile Pabulum
","Not having the mentality of a 12 year old I wasn't of the demographic the filmmakers were aiming for.Another formulaic Hollywood travesty of senseless violence. Summed up briefly this movie is just like all the other James Bond movies. An eccentric evil genius gets Bond under his power at his secret lair and instead of killing Bond instantly he decides to have a casual chat with him long enough for Bond to wreak havoc. Seen that, and been there too many times. It is old, stale, and as ridiculous as ever. In spite of all the flames, explosions, gunfire and killing, it is boring.Apart from the music and production values Skyfall was constantly eye-rolling stupid. With Daniel Craig's one-dimensional, Gloomy-Gus characterization the only women that could possibly ever be attracted to him would be obsessive necrophiliacs. The one tinge of sex happened when he snuck up on a woman and as much as raped her in the shower. How did he get there anyway? So many elements of this movie had the quality of deus ex machina. Things happen not because they could or were remotely possible but simply because it suited the idiot filmmakers. No one falls from such a height as Bond did into water and survives. Hitting water from that height is like hitting concrete. That combined with being shot with a high-powered rifle makes his survival questionable. Wasn't she aiming to take a head shot? The question of how on Earth he could have survived wasn't touched on in the slightest. Why? Because the idiot filmmakers couldn't offer a solution. No. Just have him appear suddenly later. Same as his being in M's apartment. But of course, considering her position there would be no security so it would be easy for him to break and enter. Ha! Even if they were lovers (ha!) and she gave him a key to her place it would not be a simple matter for him to surprise M. The truly simple things in this movie are the simple minds of the filmmakers.The Komodo Dragons were obviously computer added. As believable as 50-year-old blue screen. Step on a Komodo Dragon's back and it will wheel about, leap, and seize in its poisonous jaws the fool trying that. Oh, but of course, the Komodo Dragons were on the same drugs as the idiot filmmakers. Oblivious to all and everything, and so it just ignored Bond's assault upon it and kept walking as if in a daze. Just like the makers of this film. The puerile fist-and-grappling fight scenes make these top agents look like the only martial arts training and experience they had were gotten on the school yards of high schools (secondary schools).How could the antagonists be so certain Gloomy Gus was at Skyfall? He was off the grid, whereabouts unknown even to Q. Q was not tracking him he was trying to set up a false trail. If 007 and M really wanted Silver to follow them why did they have to change cars to eliminate the possibility of being tracked?Why would a woman, as in Singapore, betray her dangerous boss for the sake of some harsh Gloomy Gus because he grabbed her wrist forcefully and pointed out the possible provenance of her tattoo? Why wasn't she being listened to by Silver's people as Bond and Moneypenny were listening to each other? Haven't the filmmakers done they're homework? Traditionally in fantasy movie situations like this it is after she makes love to or at least falls in love with the protagonist that such a woman betrays the antagonist. Oh, but Bond snarlingly grabbed her wrist. That certainly would make any woman fall head-over-heals in love, or seek to use him instantly, and in public, to betray, in his own den of henchmen, a killer . A killer who held the power of life and death over her. And what was the problem with her bringing him to the island? Bond wasn't supposed to be with her? So where was she thinking she was going on a boat controlled by Silver's men?The movie was misogynist. Moneypenny was shown to be dangerously incompetent. The other two strong female leads were killed. What was Bond's reaction to the vicious cold-blooded murder of Silver's female compatriot? 'What a waste of good whiskey.' M at the end gets replaced by a man. What do the filmmakers have against women?I could have done without the 'Home-Alone'-shenanigans, with gunpowder, at Skyfall.Not only was the escape tunnel useless in that it exited into an open field visible from miles around, but the escapees needed a flashlight to see where they were going in spite of the intense firelight illuminating all from the burning mansion. They would need a flashlight for only one reason. To give the idiot filmmakers a way for Silver to spot them. Just continual eye-rolling stupidity.I like Adele's song. But having to listen to it as part of this trash ruins it. It is much better listened to on its own.My favorite part of the movie was seeing the Aston Martin DB5. I laughed when Bond flipped the cap up to the red eject button. And, yeah, I was in high school when I first saw the DB5. I'm not now.",3,7,15,30 January 2013
Gravity," The More Things Change...
","I don't know whether to be reassured or disturbed that after more than a century a space movie like this has no more scientific verisimilitude than the 1902 'A Trip to the Moon' (La Voyage dans la Lune). Whatever it is: contempt for the audience, the arrogant ignorance of film makers, or the desire to cater to the 50% of people who are below average in intelligence, I find movies harder and harder to stomach, and in this case not because of the vertigo from motion sickness but from constantly rolling my eyes at the stupidity.For those who enjoyed this movie I say, 'Great.' But don't broadcast your enthusiasm too loudly if you don't want people to know which side of the bell-shaped curve your intelligence lies.",6,2,5,16 January 2014
The Duchess," A Masterpiece
","Sumptuous images. A satisfying screenplay that did not spell everything out in small words with capital letters yet allowed for no confusion in unstated subtleties. A directorial subtlety: When we are shown a scene of G looking through a window and then being taken to look out that selfsame window the glass was thick with period imperfections.You know how lovers can come to resemble one another? In a party scene the shape and countenance of Keira's face distinctly resembled that of Charles Grey.One quibble might be clothed lovemaking in bed with a close lover. But, after all, it was Keira Knightly. Had she not been wearing that chemise I may not have been able to handle it.I was so glad at the happy ending. Happy as compared to the ending Georgiana would have soon confronted had she not read and reacted to those letters.Overall: An eye-dazzling window into another world. A world as full of imperfections as our own: different, but equally heartbreaking in the injustice.",10,4,8,26 September 2008
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An Amusing Confection
","Cute, fun, capable of not infrequently forcing a smile, attention holding; but considering it beyond the final credits one realizes it has about as much intellectual sustenance as a Mendl's confection, which itself, come to think of it, has been known to serve as successful escapist fare.A little known figment of trivia is that because of the extreme short notice Tilda Swinton was given to replace the suddenly unavailable Angela Lansbury, Ms. Swinton was forced to go on set immediately with but a minimum of makeup, unlike the hours and hours she usually spends in the chair being smoothed and powdered before going onto a movie set. Brava for this nearly naked performance Tilda dear. (If not now, when?)",7,0,4,3 April 2014
The Favourite," Execrable
","The art direction, set direction, costume design, and cinematography were all top notch. This, after all, is an art film. But of a particular genre that could only be called arty farty. There is nothing of substance whatsoever beneath the thin veneer of glitzy surface (albeit at times muddy). Nothing rings true. Nothing happens in a way that one could believe would actually happen that way. In fact, things happen, multiple things, for which there are no explanations. They just suddenly happen because they make good visual glitz. And happening they don't reach their logical conclusions. Premises are cast aside and ignored, basically slapping the thinking viewers upside their heads. It's not just the history that is wrong, it is certain explanations, character arcs, psychology; set ups and expectations that go nowhere, that just die as orphans in the pretty wasteland of this movie.",5,20,36,20 December 2018
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Typical Formulaic Hollywood Scrudge
","Basically this was a rewrite of 'King Kong.' Ape gets imported from Africa and becomes too powerful for its handlers, and there is a shoot out involving high places at the end. A lot of the special-effects ape movements were just about as realistic as those in the original 'King Kong.'So what is the message of the movie? Feeling any anger? Suffered any abuse? Then the highest degree of violence, mayhem, and murder should do it for you. Bah!In the original planet of the apes the implication was that humans devolved (inability to speak, for example) after suffering a major self-inflicted downfall. This movie implied that all humans would perish. Where we do see significant devolution in this movie is how low have become writing standards today compared with, say, 1933. I am sure there are chimps that could produce a better screenplay. And I wish they could have been chosen as screenwriters for what turned out to be this simpleminded simian slop.",5,14,36,9 August 2011
The Illusionist," Slow, boring, and painfully predictable.
","It was easy to see exactly what the 'surprise' ending would be an hour before it reared its tedious head. After all, didn't he ask her if she wanted to come with him just before the shenanigans began? And wasn't he an 'illusionist'?There was a major Hollywood fallacy that made the movie into a typical puerile Hollywood commodity. When a powerful prince, who could be beyond the law, asks his ambitious chief inspector to get rid of someone, that someone would disappear, quickly; not have endless, idiotic discussions with a namby-pamby, highly moral and indecisive chief inspector who behaved more like Captain Kangaroo rather than the ruthless, blindly-obedient servant of the prince required of the position. Did the illusionist use his high-pitched, insipid voice to hypnotize the chief inspector? Perhaps. But it would not have saved the chief inspector from the lethal wrath of the prince.And that last scene. All I could think of is, 'Where is that raised-in-luxury noblewoman going to do shopping?' No need for that when you've got dried elk patties to gather for the stove.",5,6,13,21 August 2006
