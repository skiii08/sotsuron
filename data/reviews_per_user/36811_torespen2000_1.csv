The New World," I wanted to slit my wrist and die
","Oh. My. God.Well, this has to be the most boring movie I have *ever* seen. Ever.I would rather watch a documentary of the history of knitting, narrated by Stephen Hawking, then having to watch this piece of sh|t movie again.I am SO sick of how DULL movies - and I'm talking want-to-kill-yourself-dull - is hyped up and given both acclaimed critics and award nominations. It's just too politically correct. Like when someone is nominated for an Oscar simply because they played someone mentally retarded. So sick. It's like nowadays, you get a nomination by default if you can glue together a pseudo-deep movie. Take 'Adaptation' for example. Not as bad as 'New World', but still.I watch A LOT of movies so it's not like I expected Braveheart with indians and was disappointed. I knew the 'plot' and the genre, and was utterly intrigued. But Jesus, what a let-down. Nothing happens. I mean, NOTHING happens. At least nothing that should take three hours to communicate thru movie-making. It's all whispering, gentle touches and walking through fields in the sunrise. The only plus I would give for this movie is camera/lightning and editing.Someone should make a movie about a black, retarded, sheep herder from Albania, and the struggles she faces on a daily basis. Only filmed in her kitchen. With a hand-held camera. And no music. They would be nominated in every category. Even 'Best Animated' just because it's so f*cking PC.Bitch, please.",2,2,8,22 January 2007
