Sucker Punch," When are hot chicks not hot chicks?
","When they're in this movie. You would think a movie that is FULL of women in skimpy clothing would at LEAST make this movie tolerable, but none of them can act, all of them are annoying, and...I just don't know what to say here. Seriously, this movie is THE test, the one we have all been waiting for. This is the test that determines who is an idiot and who lives. If you liked this movie, you might also like the taste of Draino or the way the world looks after you look directly at the sun for 5 hours (wait for it).I am not going to waste much more time here, but I do want to point out that the main actress looked like she either a) just farted or b)like she is trying to fart- through the whole movie. Horrible.Also, HORRIBLE sound track. What's better than your favorite songs? Nothing, so why the hell would they instead treat viewers to shitty versions of them and not just the originals? Totally uninspired from start to finish- I hope none of you have to ever see this movie, ever.",1,3,11,25 June 2013
