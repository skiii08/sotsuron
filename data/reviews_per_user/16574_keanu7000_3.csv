Requiem for a Dream," Excellent and deeper-than-usual look at lives affected by addiction
","A superbly made movie, with excellent acting and character development to say the least.Perhaps the most successful strength of the multi-dimensional film is that it simultaneously tackles a number of deep issues, including loneliness, addiction of multiple forms, dreams of being a celebrity, the quest for a better life, and outright greed.  The drug addicts in this film are not all shown to be mindless junkies, but real people who want to do better but can never seem to escape their lives of self-abuse.Hands down the best performance goes to the mother (Burstyn) as her character slowly and steadily develops throughout the film.  It is refreshing to see a movie that deals with the ever-more-common addiction to prescription drugs, a type that is rarely dealt with in most drug films. And certainly her tearful portrayal of a widowed mother living without family or a purpose epitomizes loneliness, another common but often avoided social sadness.Overall an excellent film, and a must-see.  Better and deeper than most drug films.",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
Training Day," An intruiging, intense angle to the traditional cop movie
","Better than a typical out-of-line-cop action movie, Training Day delivers as a solid drama with enough action to keep things stirring.Ethan Hawke's naive character allows us as viewers to 'feel' the intensity & chaos of L.A.'s back alleys and neighborhoods, while steadily unravelling Denzel Washington's character as an increasingly crooked narc officer who seems to know no boundaries.Perhaps the greatest success of this film is it lacks the predicatability of many other cop movies where the 'rogue cop' does have ultimate limits (i.e. The Negotiator, Bad Boys, etc), because he's really deep down a good guy. In this movie you really have to wonder if, for Washington, that good vs. evil line is ever drawn.I feel the best part of the movie, and most suspensful, is the poker game scene.  It makes a viewer truly identify with the vulnerablitity of being completely isolated, and defensless, amidst a den of cold-hearted strangers.I would recommend seeing this movie, if for any reason to see a slightly different angle to the traditional Hollywood-cop-movie formula.",Null,0,11,13 March 2004
Lost in Translation," A good romantic story that thankfully relies on intruiging acting and chemistry, not a script
","A very good romantic movie that doesn't follow the typical genre.The story addresses the lives of two married people, isolated not only from other people who speak English (it all takes place in a hotel in Tokyo), but isolated in their own marriages on some emotional level.  Their drifting 'lost'-ness leads them into an emotional rapport & curiousity with each other that leads the viewer to wonder where the platonic vs. romantic line is drawn, if at all.The performances are good, simple, and genuine, and as a viewer it is easy to identify with the characters' feelings of quiet personal despair, and with the excitement that something new (but risky) brings.Undoubtedly the crowning strength of this movie is in its dialogue, and appropriate lack of it at times.  It is refreshingly powerful to see actors use unspoken glances, eye contact, and body language to speak volumes without the need for an explicit script.  Many other romantic movies fail in this regard by spelling everything out too obviously, and detaches the audience from true, realistic emotion.  Not so here.Without giving away the ending, I will say that the ending is what made this movie a great film.  Anything other than how it ended would have undoubtedly ruined the movie.A good movie to see, the story is not terribly complex and has more of a feel of being a short-story, but this style serves the movie well.  The want-what-you-can't-have sadness (or could have... if you gave it all up) often accompanying romance is illustrated very well here.",Null,0,1,13 March 2004
