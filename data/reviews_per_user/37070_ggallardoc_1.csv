Skyfall," Skyfall. Bond rises
","Using the terminology of the Dark Knight trilogy of my admired Nolan, I can say that James Bond has emerged from the abyss into which it fell after the disappointing Quantum of Solace. SKYFALL is presented as the film that celebrates the 50th anniversary of the series, a high bar that far exceeds.Eye spoilers! The argument is born and dies (and this is not a clich√©) with M, Bond's boss with the wisdom embodied by Judi Dench usual. The plot revolves around the theft of identities list of MI6 agents, a sort of revenge carried out by the villain of the movie, our Javier Bardem, which does very well as bad, surely one of the best of 007 films.I could say the same about the movie, but Casino Royale is unsurpassed. The direction of Sam Mendes, which gave us American Beauty and Road to Perdition, is just remarkable, is beautifully filmed and photographed, with a small section of the film lacks pace perhaps, but very good overall. Daniel Craig continues to confirm that is the best Bond, the places you visit are so incredible as always, the Bond girls breath away when they come on the screen and the plot is very entertaining. As the film progressed I felt as trapped, although the room was not the room 25 Kinepolis wonderful as I remembered my friends conveniently.An anniversary like this needed a Bond to match, and the continual references to characters, gadgets, villains (tribute to shark included) and cars in the series are to thank for the fans of it. The time that the new Q presents James is anthological dialogue with really bright. Just leave two data without revealing: why the title, a success over the tape and the replacement of a character to be at the summit.",9,1,7,27 May 2013
