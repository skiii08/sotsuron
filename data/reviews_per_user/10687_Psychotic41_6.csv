Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A truly exceptional prequel !
","When George Lucas set out to make a prequel to his breathtaking films that went down in history, Star Wars no one thought it would have such mixed reviews. This film even though some people didn't like it I thought it was truly a sight to see. The scale of the movie was very large, just like the originals and it works well with the story. The special effects also set ground for its time. The actors Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, and Jake Loyd all seem well together and seem like there ready to take on the task of going to follow up to Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher.The Story centers around two jedi who set out to make peace with a greedy trade federation and end a dispute. They end up having to protect the pretty Queen Amidala of Naboo and it starts a full scale battle. Now when they go to Tatooine to fix there ship they pick up a young Anakin Skywalker who has the force and is said to make the force have balance forcing him to leave his mother. Now on the planet which I'm not going to try to spell and try to tell the senate about the invasion which the federation is forcing to do and end up going back to Naboo to fight a war that must end in this pre battle to the horrid clone war years later.
The comic relief of Jar Jar Binks should be more liked because you can't help liking his comedy references. Also we meet R2-D2 and then C3PO the droids and its funny. This blockbuster is accepted in my heart and should be accepted in yours, so let the force be with you...",10,1,3,8 June 2002

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A Breathtaking Epic of huge scale and beauty
","The first installment of this long awaited trilogy is a huge success. The movie's 3 hour runtime is very long but dosen't seem as long as it is. Unlike Harry Potter this film takes itself a little bit more seriously but is as good. The story drifts away from the little bit better book but is still good. The actors such as Elijah Wood, Ian Mckellen, Liv Tyler and all of them are truly talented actors who give us oscar worthy performances. The beautiful New Zealand locations are truly stunning. Its sequels are long awaited and will be just as good. I give this film a ten and so should you.",10,1,1,5 June 2002
Gone with the Wind," THE BEST FILM EVER MADE
",The Epic pulitzer prize winning novel by Margaret Mitchell is brought to life as a story of the old south on the verge of war which would turn out to be the civil war. The story revoles around a plantation owners family with there daughter Scarleet O'Hara(played by Vivian Leigh in an Oscar Winning performance) and Rhett Butler(played mysteriously by Oscar Winner Clark Gable)who fall in love after bitter fights and a hideous war and sparks that fly but they just don't know it. As the war moves into Atlanta the Yankees take over it and the action flares as the stars try to ecscape it. Next struggles and Triumphs start and things start to get worse as the film gets good. Judged by many as the greatest film of all time the film won 10 Academy Awards and won Hattie McDaniel the oscar and set grounds for a african american. The film is still a glorious film after all these years and is absolutley breathtaking. Followed years later by a just as good Epic sequel 'Scarlett'. Deserves a ten and a place in your heart,10,1,1,19 April 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A FIRST RATE ADAPTION
","Based on the first excellent novel by author J.K. Rowling the film is a wonderful success.When orphaned Harry Potter finds out that he is a wizard he starts school at Hogwarts and is befriended by Ron Weasly, and Hermione Granger. But is disliked by jealous enemy Draco Malfoy. The adventure and fantasy runs wild from the Quidditch field to the stunning climax this film is going to be a classic. Played by Daniel Radcliffe Harry Potter is brought to visual life along with smart young actor Rupert Grint who portrays Ron and pretty Emma Watson as the adventerous witch Hermione. This film lacks the glory of the book at times but it flys by with its run time and is directed very elegantly by Chris Columbus film deserves a ten and is wildly waited for its sequels.",10,0,0,19 April 2002
Halloween," ONE OF THE BEST HORROR FILMS EVER MADE
",Shot in 20 days this turned out to be an independent classic. John Carpenters superb direction can't be beat with the films quality.The films performance's by Donald Pleasance and scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis are good.The killer Michael Myers is brought to chilling life by Major Payne director Nick Castle.The killers way of murders are later copied by wannabe Jason Vorhees who just can't live up to Michael. Also the film Friday the 13th wasn't ment for Jason in the first place it was his mother and now twenty years later Jason is in space and it couldn't get stupider. Thats what he gets for trying to Copy the best. The look of the film is creepy and can't be beat. The film's length is good and by far this is better than The Exorcist and lives up to Psycho as one of the best horror films ever made and deserves to be watched because at the end of the film you will know the killer is 'purely and simply evil....',10,0,0,29 April 2002
