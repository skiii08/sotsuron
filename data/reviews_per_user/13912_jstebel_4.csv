Requiem for a Dream," So excellent I wanted to shoot myself afterwards!
","But seriously, this film was fantastic. Darren Aronofsky is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors with pi, which I loved, but found a little lacking, and now this film, flawless in almost every way possible. THis film took Marlon Wayans and made you forget that he was Marlon Wayans. I never would've guessed he had talent and he was fantastic in it. Jared Leto, the pretty boy who I've always liked as an actor does his best Michael Rappaport accent here to the point where I actually thought it was Rappaport doing voice overs for Leto. 'For Chrissakes!' Ellyn Bursten... WOW... this was one of, no this WAS the BEST performance by an actress i've yet seen. Only problem I had with this film was with Jennifer Connelly. This woman is incapable of looking anything but incredibly beautiful, no matter how depreaved her character is supposed to be. She's the only character who, despite the filmmakers' and the make up people's efforts, never looks less than gorgeous, which honestly i didn't mind after seeing what happens to the rest of the main characters on their long slow journey to the bottom.",9,0,0,14 May 2001
Memento," Fantastic! I haven't enjoyed a film this much since Fight Club!
","I do NOT want to spoil any aspect of this film, suffice it to say this is the best film I've seen in a year and a half and I recommend anyone and everyone with a love for intelligent, stylish, intellectual entertainment go see it. Guy Pearce does an incredible job of playing a man who due to an attack on him and his wife, loses his ability to form new memories.
The way this film is structured is delightfully confusing, taking twists in both style and plot. The matrix refugees, Joe Patalangio and Carrie Ann Moss both do great jobs as supporting antagonists (a quite suitable oxymoron)and compliment Guy Pearce's character 'Lenny' extremely well.Any plot holes or inconsistancies are either hidden and explained later, except for one that after you see the film you'll realize you don't care about because it served the plot SO well.In short, this film is a must see, definetely the best film of 2001 thus far and it's gonna be hard to top. I can't wait to own this film on DVD and watch commentary, any deleted scenes it might have. It should come packaged with a sticker 'If you like Fight Club, then you'll LOVE MOMENTO!!!' 10/10 a true cinematic masterpiece",10,0,0,21 April 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," If you REALLY think about this film and have seen other martial arts films, this is NOTHING special, hated it in fact
","Flying Is no problem. I can suspend disbelief enough to understand that these are supposed to me 'mystical' figures. But to see them pumping their legs just looks ridiculous. OK, that being said, let's talk about the actual substance of the film.Well, except for some beautiful cinematography and a great soundtrack, there's not much substance to this film. The plot IS razor thin. The only character that gets developed is Jen, and she's contemptable with her foolish attitude. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have the most stale romantic tension about them. in fact, you need a couple of characters telling michelle yeoh that she has feelings for him to even know at all.
The fight scenes are just plain ridiculous, wasn't impressed with them at all usually when people fight in a martial arts film, you notice an exhibition of acrobatic prowess and it looks like the characters are actually trying to hurt each other. This was not the case with CTHD. It looked like the characters were being swung at each other from ropes and they were playing pattycake (no, really) rather than fighting to the death.
The flashback, while without a doubt enjoyable and the most beautiful part of the film, ruins ANY and ALL forward momentum this film had going for it. I felt so detached from every character except for Jen, and I HATED her character, even though she's extremely gorgeous.There is no plot, so therefore you wouldn't think that there'd be any holes, but there still manages to be holes in there anyway. How did this Jade Fox manage to learn all this stuff from a manual when she said herself she couldn't interpret it? How did she get into the service of Jen in the first place? Why does Michelle Yeoh's character get mad at her for no good reason? watch that scene again. it's like she just gets mad so there would be a convienient way for them to fight. It's completely ridiculous. People make fun of the Phantom Menace Star Wars Plot. In so many ways CTHD is a rip off of Star Wars. Young girl (luke/anakin) being trained by evil old crusty master (emperor palpatine). Rougish rebel (Leia/Han) becomes love interest. Chow Yun Fat (Qui Gon Jinn/Luke/Obi Wan) tries to convert Jen over to the good side of the Wudan (force) it's just silly. 3/10",5,1,1,21 April 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Entertaining as all heck!!!
","WHile not the best Coen Bros. Film by a long shot, I must say this movie was one hell of a ride. I was hoping for a tighter interpretation of the Odyssey, but it was good enough. the soundtrack to this movie was amazing, and that's really what drove this movie along, the music. George CLooney was fabulous and his performance reminded me in a weird way of the way Bruce Campbell would have acted in this movie! haha. THe music alone is worth the price of admission to this flick. and it's utterly utterly entertaining :)",9,0,0,14 January 2001
