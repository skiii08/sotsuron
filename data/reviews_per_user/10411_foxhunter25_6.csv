Taxi Driver," Taxi Driver (1976)
","Taxi Driver was a great movie. It is about a taxi driver that wants to clean up NYC's 'scum'. In the movie he works on cleaning him self up and tries to kill a senator, but he doesn't and ends up saving the life of a 12 year old prostitute. To do this he had to kill three people. I really like how this movie was filmed. At some points during the film the scene had a kind of glow to them and others were crystal clear, I thought this made the film more interesting. I give this film a 9 out of 10 because I really enjoyed watching it, and I thought it was very captivating. This is one of those movies where if it were to be released today it would fit right in, even though it was filmed in 1976.",9,0,0,7 December 2012
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now (1979)
","Apocalypse Now is an amazing film. The cinematography is fantastic. Francis Ford Coppola does a marvelous job with the lighting and shadows. I think this film is a great way to show people a glimpse of what the Vietnam veterans had to deal with when we were at war. This film was very deep and meaningful, but they story line the film was based around isn't very believable. The fact that a soldier had to go and eliminate a rouge commander, that was actually helping win the war, is just not that believable. Over all I thought it was a great film. I give this film more of a 9.5 than a 10, because I really liked watching it, but it was a very intense film.",10,0,1,7 December 2012
The Graduate," The Graduate (1967)
","The Graduate was a very funny and entertaining film. The movie is about a young man who comes home from college, not knowing what he wants to do with his life. This results in him sleeping with one of his parent's friend. However later in the movie this cause a problem because he wants to marry his parent's friend's daughter. He ens up stealing her away RIGHT AFTER she got married to another man. This movie is really funny and has amazing film editing, but the theme the film is based around is a little odd and can be uncomfortable at some points. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because it was a great film, its a classic, and i enjoyed it, but not that much.",Null,0,0,4 December 2012
Singin' in the Rain," Singin' in the Rain (1952)
","I think Singin' in the Rain is the best musical of all time. This is such an energetic film, definitely one for the whole family. Its about a how a studio deals with the new switch to sound movies, in 1927. I used to watch this film with my great grandfather all the time. I don really like musicals, especially modern ones (like the TV show glee), but Singin' in the Rain is different and I don't really think of it as musical (yes I know it is). Even though musicals always have that sense of make-believe, i feel Singin' in the Rain has a more real feeling to it than most musicals. I give this film a 10 out of 10 because it is such a great musical and its one of my favorite movies ever.",10,0,2,10 November 2012
Psycho," Psycho (1960)
","Psycho Is about a young woman, Marion, who steals $40,000 from her employer in order for her to start a new life with her secret lover. On her way to him she is forced by sleep and rain to stop at a motel. Here she meets this young man that is controlled by his mother. Psycho is very well known for its famous shower stabbing scene. Alfred Hitchcock made the scene seem so real, but without even showing Marion getting stabbed. Marion's sister and friend come looking for her and soon find out the truth(which i will not give away). The ending was very unpredictable, and well done. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because I thought Hitchcock did a very good job creating this film, but it did not really keep me entertained.",7,0,0,31 October 2012
