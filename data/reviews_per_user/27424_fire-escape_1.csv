Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A solid addition to the fleet.
","Stranger Tides brings tidings from strangers in this extension of a  1-part turned 3-part franchise, now pitted to carry on into its sixth  instalment of the saga. Rob Marshall steps in to take the helm as  director, as Johnny Depp continues his reign as the titular Jack  Sparrow. No longer legend for his captaincy, we find Sparrow in London  amidst the largest collection of known British actors outside of Harry  Potter. After rescuing first mate Gibbs (he's the one who slept with  the pigs) from hanging under Sparrow's name, our swaggering  swashbuckler discovers there's a new Jack in town.  Meanwhile an arms race is taking place between the Brits (led by  Geoffrey Rush's now peg- legged Barbossa), the Spaniards, and big ol'  Blackbeard to find the Fountain of Youth. Pretty self-explanatory,  their motives and maps are laid out in a series of hops back and forth  from exposition to rehashed sword-fight and chase sequences through the  streets of London. While Jack's runaways are more Austin Powers than  Bond, the swift swish of metal is far preferable to Verbinski's  interminable distraction with ship battles in parts 2 and 3. It takes a  long time to get to the captain crossover and corrupt bargaining that  the first film did so well, with a race to the finish opposed to a  tactical playoff. But, warming up to a reunion between Sparrow and  Barbossa, it's the archival camaraderies that bring out the best in the  remaining key characters. It's in this unlikely union you'll find most  of the laughs.  Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane team up as Sparrow's ex-lover Angelica  and evil buccaneer Blackbeard, though her needy deception and his  one-note barbarism don't liven up proceedings as much as Will and  Elizabeth's foolish frivolities have in prequels past. In a despairing  attempt to plug the gap, too much is made of an attraction between a  random mercenary and mermaid - by the by, a depiction of the mythical  creatures is too close to a Lynx advert for comfort, and the key to a  center-piece so pointless that it's almost a relief that CG was  similarly cut and plugged with slow-searing 3D effects.  Hingeing heavily on Sparrow's well-documented improvisation, many of  the set-pieces are fun and nimble, though frustratingly hampered by  needless 3D which knocks the pace of the action sequences. Hans  Zimmer's ever-excellent score pulls together all the rogue threads,  keeping well within the range of the first film and injecting a  vigorous dose of fun. Restrained and keeping convention, Pirates 4 is  far from heading up the franchise, but remains a solid addition to the  fleet.",7,80,156,10 May 2011
