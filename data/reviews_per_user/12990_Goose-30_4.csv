The Blair Witch Project," How it was made is more interesting than the actual product.
","This movie apparently lives up to the hype and scares the bejeebers out of some people. Personally, I wasn't impressed, and one kid in front of me got up after it was over and said 'it wasn't as good as I thought it'd be' and all of his friends agreed. So be warned -- Your Mileage May Vary.I didn't find the characters sympathetic, and although believable, most of the time they were just plain annoying. If I had been with that group of people, I would've quietly slipped away and followed a river back to civilization and left them to wander around in circles and scream at each other like a bunch of idiots. The witch wants 'em? Great, she can keep 'em.However - the characters in this film are incidental to the overall concept, which is the real star of the show, and my central complaint. This isn't a great film - It's a great concept done in a mediocre way. Compare and contrast with, say, 'Silence of the Lambs', which took a mediocre concept - a cannibal serial killer meets an attractive female FBI agent - and made it into something great. Most of what makes 'Lambs' so effective is the character of Clarice, and how much we believe in her and like her.
These guys relied too heavily on their gimmick. The result is interesting and certainly worth seeing (it'll be better on video than in the theatre) but unfortunately, it's just not a great film.",4,0,1,5 August 1999
Fight Club," Screwball romantic comedy!
","Don't let the title of this film fool you - you're in for a rollicking good time!This is classic, screwball romantic comedy. Those of you who've already seen it, just imagine the lead roles played by Billy Crystal, Daniel Stern and Meg Ryan, and I think you'll see my point. Sure, it's a little... different... from 'You Gots Mail', but at it's heart it's just a simple, funny, quirky little love story. See, it's all about this guy - young guy, thirty or so - and all he wants to do is hang out with his guy pals and never grow up. All along, he's completely denying himself of the one thing he truly needs to get his life on track - the love of a good woman. Guys, I know you'll relate, and gals, I'm sure you've known a fella or two like this. It's an old, old story, but somehow David Fincher and crew seem to breathe new life into it. You'll want to watch this one over and over again, I guarantee! Invite a date, a spouse, a mistress or a grandparent over this evening and enjoy it with someone you love!",10,0,1,26 October 2000
Interstellar," Should have used some of that budget to hire a screenwriter
","One of the biggest letdowns to come along in ages. Not even McConaughey can put an interesting spin on this half-baked, ham-fisted rubbish. It's an amateurish mess of clich√©s, clumsy exposition, pretentious nonsense, cheap manipulation, and predictable twists. I felt like walking out, but I kept thinking at least there might be some stunning visual effects coming up... nope. The space scenes are serviceable at best, the alien planets are either a blank expanse of water or a blank expanse of ice, apocalyptic Earth is just like normal Earth except with some dust blowing around... where exactly did that big budget go?If you dislike this film within the first twenty minutes, don't waste your time sticking around. It doesn't get any better.",3,12,23,16 November 2014
Eyes Wide Shut," Pacing by Merchant & Ivory, Subtlety by Oliver Stone
","I really expected that this film's detractors just hadn't 'gotten it'. I figured that I, Kubrick fan that I am, would recognize this film as the masterpiece that it undoubtedly is.Nope.It's a bad film. No two ways about it. It's ham-handed, outdated, ridiculous, absurdly sluggish and the blame for the terrible performances rests squarely on Kubrick's perfectionist shoulders. Kidman was terrific in 'To Die For' - I'm not a fan of Van Sant, but at least he knows how to work with people. I think Kubrick was too old and out of his element to make this movie. It was a bold step for him, I think, and I give him credit for trying. I'm just disappointed that it failed and wish that 'A.I.' could've been his swan song instead of this.I think this film, edited down to the half-hour of solid material that's actually there, will make a great after-school special in 2030. If you haven't seen it yet... I'd wait.",7,0,1,23 April 2000
