Blade Runner 2049," A Sequel that expands the original movie's greatness
","Just saw the new Blade Runner. The first one is one of my favorite movies of all time for bringing the noir style to scifi movies and adding layers to a somewhat simple category. So I was concerned if they would do a sequel that would keep the franchise where it should be - the top. And I must say - it was better! All things I liked in the first one were there and expanded. Denis Villeneuve (director) and Ridley Scott (producer) took the original concept, added more storytelling, criticism to current world actions, paid homage to the original movie and showed how important certain things from the past are. Another great thing is a movie about the future without the common gadgets, cell phones, social media or TV. Brilliant cinematography, score, pace (nothing feels rushed, each scene is well crafted), acting and directing.Gosling and Ford are outstanding. Ana de Armas is great. I would only have chosen an older actor to play Wallace- Leto is not convincing in the role. Without giving any spoilers, I recommend seeing this masterpiece. 10/10.",10,2,9,8 October 2017
Source Code," Definitely not the typical action movie - and that is great!
","Definitely not the typical action movie - and that is great! Great sci-fi with a good message, Source Code starts giving you the impression you came to watch Groundhog day, but way before the mid-point of the movie, you get addicted to it and move to the edge of your seat.First of all, the acting is superb, although I am not a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal. The actress playing Christina is also very good, and Vera Farmiga is great as always, especially in a situation where she only shows her face for 95% of the movie.If you like movies with twists this is for you, but it is definitely not your typical predictable action movie.At the end, it is a tale about what is important in life, and shows us once more how life is rare and that we should value every 8 minutes of it. The open-end gives room for interpretation and treats spectators with respect without laying it all out.",9,0,1,7 January 2012
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino's masterpiece
","As well said at the end of the movie, this is indeed Tarantino's masterpiece, together with 'Pulp Fiction'.All the elements that made Tarantino's films enjoyable are there: the dialogs, the freaks, the subtle tension, the attention to details and the hidden sarcasm, the drama and the comedy leaving the audience on the edge of their seats, without feeling the 153 minutes of the movie pass by.I loved how Tarantino left the message very clearly: 'Forget about the politically incorrect and the history books, I will make a film how I think it should be done and I will give the Nazis what they deserved. And in the process of doing so, I will make fun of some cultures too, including the American one'. And he does that playing with clichés in a way that only one of the best directors alive can do! In Tarantino's world, the characters all have flaws, villains and good guys have good and bad behaviors. Even the pretty French lady whose family was slaughtered had to pay with his life when she considered giving forgiveness to someone who did not deserve it.Brad Pitt and Christopher Waltz both deserve Oscars for their performance, giving life to great dialogs. Waltz speak French, English, German, and Italian! Pitt is hilarious, especially when he struggles with foreign languages ('Buon giorrrno' said during an evening event).Certain scenes were made for perfection: The first scene of the movie has its tension built up in a way that make spectators enjoy every second of it - every sip of milk, every smoke of tobacco.Best movie of the year, without a doubt! 10!",10,2,9,27 August 2009
The Hunger Games," Good popcorn movie but falls flat in several aspects
","I confess I never read the books this film is based on. I also did not read any reviews before stepping into the theater and I was concerned whether this was a movie solely directed to teens or adults like me would also enjoy it.What really called my attention was the outstanding box office in its first weekend. In short, I came into the theater without high expectations as most of the people who read the books had.At the end, I left with mixed feelings:I think the movie counts with great photography (although I hate the shaky camera trend), costumes, good performance by the veteran actors like Donald Sutherland and the Sugar Monster Lady, and a good surprise with the young leading actress. And finally, a nice way to show a dark, hopeless future and a warning to the descending spiral we have been taking with the reality shows.What is bad? First, the pace was too slow in the first half of the movie. You would imagine they do it on purpose to allow character development, but the feeling is they fall flat. Little we learn about the district 12 boy (Peeta), the past of the main characters like Woody Harrelson's and how the country got to that situation. Second, not sure if either the Peeta character is bad or the actor did a bad job, but he comes across very weak, and the girl is definitely who wears the pants in the relationship. Third, the fights sequences had no suspense at all. Immediate kills without leaving the audience at the edge of the seats. Fourth,the plot: So, the idea of the government is to have the Hunger Games as a way to avoid riots by the masses? Really? After 49 years knowing that every year a friend or relative will be executed in national TV? Isn't this enough to start a riot? Fifth, the Cato character is not developed at all - spectators are not really led to dislike him, he reminded me the bad high school guy in the first Karate Kid movie. By the way, shouldn't the lead actress be looking less healthy/hot for someone who did not even had bread to eat?Finally, the feeling is that the book is much darker than what we saw on the screen, and the producers wanted to lighten it up and get PG13 rating to boos audience. That leaves the movie suitable only for teenagers at most.All in all, a reasonable popcorn movie. Given the outstanding box office though, I would not expect them to change the formula for the other two coming. A real shame given the success of the books.",6,1,6,31 March 2012
Midnight in Paris," Woody Allen for the masses - and it works!
","Excellent movie... While it follows the same self-portrait that Allen did in other movies (with Owen Wilson surprisingly playing Allen well), it brings a lighter atmosphere, laughs, entertainment, romance that will please the audiences around the world, having as a background the most loved city and several of the appreciated and controversial artists who lived there.Rachel McAdams does a good job as the empty-headed fiancée, and Owen shows what each of us went through at some point in our lives: the feeling that we could be happier somewhere else or with someone else. He falls in love with the city, the artists and finally with a woman who intrigues and stimulates him in a way he can't find at present times.Great cameos by excellent actors (Adrien Brody is great). If Allen wanted to do a movie that was faithful to his roots, and bring fun to the audience while making his point in an artsy way, he certainly hit jackpot! I still prefer some other movies of his but this one does bring more entertainment!The message I got at the end is that no place is better than where we are, as long as our demons are well resolved and we can find there the things and people we love.",9,1,2,8 January 2012
Knowing," Sixth Sense, Independence Day , Lost, 10 Commandments, etc...
","I actually enjoyed the first part of the movie and the fact it was not the typical sci-fi with a happy ending but there were too many scenes that seemed extracted from other movies like:1- Whispers and Plane crash (with the same close-up of the turbine): LOST 2- NYC destruction: Day the Earth stood still, Independence Day 3- Final scene: one of those biblical movies 4- Aliens and spaceship: War of the worlds, E.T... 5- Little kid glazing at the 'angels': Sixth sense I have no problems with those references as long as the plot have worked. The movie does a good job in hooking us in and make us think a bit about how life is temporary, but it was quite hard to understand:<ul><li>What is the reason for the premonitions (50 years before the apocalypse)? Just to tell Lucinda where she should go to be saved? Wouldn't the ETs take her anyway? - What was the point of involving Nicolas Cage's character if he could not be saved anyway? He found out about the latitude/longitude where the save was going to happen only to go there and say goodbye?</li></ul>",7,1,3,24 April 2009
Bad Teacher," Bad teacher, bad acting, bad jokes, bad movie!
","I really don' t understand why Hollywood still chooses Cameron Diaz for movies like this. Does she really bring enough box office?This movie is really bad and at the end I was very glad I did not go to the theaters to watch it. First of all, a comedy is about providing the audience with good laughs. I could not laugh at all, and I am not grumpy - I watched Friends with Benefits and Hangover II in the same week and although not superb comedies, they were way better than this!Anyhow, Cameron is way too old to play the teacher who gets money in the high school car wash activity. The movie is also a very bad example for teenagers who watched this - the bad teacher triumphs at the end and the good teacher is punished for possessing drugs that she does not own!One thing is to film a dark, politically incorrect comedy. A totally different thing is to make a movie with a terrible story and insert bad jokes randomly. Avoid!",1,10,17,7 January 2012
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Best thought provoking film of 2014
","Just watched Birdman last night...I love the feeling of coming out of the theater without having all the answers and discussing with your companion how they interpreted it! This movie has multiple layers and you were invited to peel off the onion in a fluid cinematography that adds value to the overall story. Lubezki applies the concept of 'camera always running' to add realism and to make the audience part of the movie. Amazing how a 2 hour long movie which is shot basically all inside a theater, is able to capture everyone's attention without getting dull, due to genius acting, directing and the relentless camera-work. Keaton, perfect for the role, given his history with superhero and being forgotten for so many years, delivers a visceral interpretation without worrying about his image, with pure focus on the character. Norton is at his best- the rehearsal scene with Keaton is amazing, and so is his dialogs with Stone. A movie that criticizes mainstream cinema, and will make you reflect about choices, about family, career, and love. The end is left open for interpretation. Without spoiling it, in my opinion it is part of the main character's delusion and how he wants to be admired. After all, what do we say when we talk about love?",10,11,22,8 February 2015
Taken 2," Be careful - your money will be TAKEN !!
","Taken 2 is another example of a greedy producer who wants to milk the success of the first movie, knows that there should not be a sequel and tries to maximize profits by hiring dumb writers who have never been outside US.I have been to Istambul and it has almost nothing to do what we saw in the movie. OK, the Bosphorus and the mosques are there and that's it. People don't behave that way and the movie is full of flaws which makes it look like a comedy.In one of the scenes, father and daughter are in a boat and he starts telling her that the waterway separates Europe and Asia and it has been used for more than 2500 years, blah blah. And she asks how he knows all of that. The answer, which is probably the same as the source of the research writers and director did for this movie, was that he read it in a guide book in the plane on the way there.Anyway, the flaws have been pointed by several other reviews but what most annoyed me was the lack of depth in the scenes and characters. What happened to the realism of the first movie?When the girl started detonating grenades on the rooftops of the most touristic area of Istambul so her father could accurately say how far she was from where he was being held captive, a lot of people in the theater started laughing.Save your money, and wait for the DVD in case you are really curious about it.",4,0,1,15 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," I will need to watch it again
","Just watched it last night, and I have the impression I will need to watch it again to fully appreciate it. My first reaction was that this was an over ambitious project, and we should give kudos to producers/directors who decided to go for a movie with a $100M budget that does not really fit the typical model to guarantee their box office return.It is not a movie for all kind of audiences as it is not easy to follow (although I think the editing helped us a lot) and the fact that different accents and dialects are spoken make your job a bit harder.Having said that, it is a terrific idea, fairly well executed, with good performances by all actors (except Hugh Grant who just played...Hugh Grant as always). The only negative comment I have is that in a 3hr movie you should not leave with the impression that characters were not developed well enough. And I definitely felt that way in some of the stories (for example the first story we spend too much time watching the doctor trying to poison Burgess, while that time could have been employed better to develop the slave character). As a result of this underdevelopment, the film does not achieve the emotional level it aims for.But clear correlations (and other not so clear which is good) among the stories exist to make the overall arch work effectively. References to older sci-fi movies are there, as a way to honor them. I thought this was also great. FInally, it is a sci-fi movie, yes, but which puts humanistic views in the first place. And make us think about souls, karma, God, cause- consequence. In one of the first scenes of the movie, it is said something like: 'If this was all created by God, what are the things we can and can not change? '. We are still trying to answer that question.",9,13,20,29 December 2012
