Raiders of the Lost Ark," The best adventure movie ever made!
","This is without a doubt the best movie Steven Spielberg has ever directed.This movie introduces us to Indiana Jones who is played by Harrison Ford. In this movie Indiana Jones has to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis. We get to see some really great action scenes where Indiana battles with the Nazis. This is a true adventure movie from start to finish.This movie has a great story, great acting, especially from Harrison Ford, and it never slows down. What is really great watching this movie nowadays is that it is not ruined by crappy CGI and really over the top action scenes.It's too bad that they don't make em like this anymore...",10,0,1,3 September 2009
Predator," They don't make em like this anymore...
","Watching this brings back the good old days. There is no way that they would make a movie like this anymore. Nowadays a movie like this would be ruined by too much CGI. Watching the same 'girlie men' that star in a Hollywood movie these days in a movie like this, would be hilarious! The film follows a group of soldiers on a rescue mission into the jungle. Deep in the jungle they soon find themselves battling an 'invisible' enemy from another world.Predator has a simple but interesting plot. The whole atmosphere in the movie is great. The cast is perfect for a movie like this. The action is wild and mindless but not too over the top, like in a lot of movies nowadays. To sum it up I would recommend this movie to all who like good action movies with elements of science fiction.",10,2,4,19 May 2009
Die Hard," One of the best action movies ever...
","I love movies like this. When the good guy is trapped all alone in a situation and he has to 'take care' of all the bad guys by him self to save the day. In this classic first Die Hard we see John McClane, played by Bruce Willis, get trapped in a skyscraper with a gang of terrorist. McClane has to find a way to take down the terrorists before they kill his wife and all the other people that they have as hostages.Die hard is without a doubt one of the best action movies ever. It has been copied by other movies many times. Some have been pretty successful, others have failed miserably. What makes Die hard so good you might ask? I would say the combination of a simple story about a man that has to fight to save his family with intense action sequences and great humor. Another thing that makes this movie great is the acting job done by Bruce Willis. He can play a guy like this better than anyone else.If you feel like watching a old school action film with great humor and no crappy CGI, i would recommend you give Die hard a chance!",9,1,1,28 June 2009
True Romance," Should be in the top 250
","This movie is one of my all time favorites (Top 10). The story is great, the cast is fantastic and the dialog is unbelievable. The story is about a young couple who gets their hands on a case full of cocaine by mistake and decides to travel to California to sell it.This movie contains some of the best scenes in motion picture history, especially the one with Dennis Hopper and Christopher Walken, but also the one with James Gandolfini and Patricia Arquette.The scrip for True Romance from Quentin Tarantino is one of his top 3. Tony Scott, who has directed some of the best movies ever but also some of the worst movies ever, did a really good job directing this movie.I would recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it yet, and hopefully we will see this movie in the top 250 very soon.",10,3,4,18 May 2009
