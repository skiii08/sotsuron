Black Swan," Intellectual-Camp
","I had a lot of fun watching the gorgeous Natalie Portman go through her pirouettes. A film that runs the gamut from 'The Red Shoes' to 'Repulsion' without reaching the heights of those masterpieces it manages to be an original opus from one of the most interesting directors of late. Darren Aronofsky's confidence is overwhelming. I regret I'll be dead and buried by the time Natalie Portman is 50 but I would give anything to see what this wonderful actress will be by that age. Here, she goes through the motions without avoiding any of the enormous difficulties her character requires. Vincent Cassel plays the French choreographer with a touch of Dhiagelev and oodles of sex appeal. Winona Ryder gives the film its campy touches, which makes the whole enterprise much more accessible than it seems at first. I enjoyed it very much even if I was aware of the effort to be seriously intellectual.",7,45,77,4 December 2010
Troy," Not recommended, even for Brad Pitt fans.
","This is a dreadful film. Brad Pitt, who usually turns in a good job of acting, was completely miscast, and utterly uncomfortable and unbelievable in his role of Achilles. The screenplay was a conglomerate of war and killing, killing, killing...with a smattering of love scenes. Wolfgang Petersen did a terrible job of directing and was shameless in his constant posing and posturing of his lead actor, so much so that even though Brad Pitt is beautiful to look at, one became really bored with watching him strutting around flexing his muscles. Since that's not the type of thing this wonderful actor does, one has to lay the blame on the director.Too bad, too bad. What a waste of time and money.",1,21,39,20 December 2005
Zero Dark Thirty," Torture
","It has been established, it wasn't torture or, quoting that dishonest euphemism, 'enhanced interrogation' that took the intelligence community to Bin Laden. So, how is it possible that this film by intelligent people would perpetrate that lie? The film is technically brilliant but it becomes tedious because, naturally, we know the ending. The other strange fact is the casting of Jessica Chastain. She seems elsewhere, emotionally and otherwise. I couldn't connect with her, I was far too aware of the 'acting' I see she's getting lots of acting nominations, I don't quite get it. Katheryn Bigelow at the helm does a truly extraordinary job, but I can't help, worrying that most people will take this as fact and, perhaps, the most important aspect is pure fiction. No tortured prisoner took us to Bin Laden, okay?",7,74,147,21 December 2012
The Terminal," Avoid this film like the plague. Absolutely not recommended.
","What in the world was Spielberg thinking? Tom Hanks must have said yes to this film without reading the screenplay. It is so bad, so unbelievable, so ridiculous. I watched it to the bitter end hoping that there might be something redeemable in the almost two hours...but no, nothing redeemable appeared. Boy oh boy, what a disappointment.That someone could be stranded in an airport and stay nine months, building a wall, sleeping in one of the waiting rooms night after night without being thrown out, that an airport manager could do the things that Tucci does in this film...well, I can't believe that anyone could buy the story of The Terminal. What a waste of talent: Zeta-Jones, Hanks, Tucci, Spielberg. Wow! I don't recommend this film at all.",1,20,39,11 January 2006
The Social Network," An Acceptable Form Of Horror
","Maybe I'm too old. No, not maybe, I am. I saw this characters as aliens of sorts. I know they represent today's landscape, brrrrr. The film as a film is one of the best of David Fincher but the universe it explores gave the chills. A world approaching its end, fast. The youth of the characters made it even more sinister. I couldn't detect their soul or any evidence of its existence. In a way they represent the worst of the previous generations. Roman Emperors or Wall Street. Profit is the name of the game and the ideas come out of boredom of longings to get laid. Love and friendship, loyalty and/or honor as obsolete as good manners. Jesse Eisenberg is chillingly perfect as the humanoid that started it all - or did he? - Justin Timberlake keeps surprising me. Good, very good and Andrew Garfield, the most recognizable of the characters is a victim of sorts and he'll be destroyed no matter how much money he gets. How I wish this was merely a science-fiction film.",7,392,675,4 December 2010
