Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," True Fans?
","I'm tired of people saying that I am not a 'True Fan' because I think The Phantom Menace was disappointing.  This is simply not true.  I am a huge fan of the franchise.  But, that doesn't mean that I'm going to pray at the altar of George Lucas, simply because he made another Star Wars movie.No 'True Fan' can admit that the story or the characters of TPM were better than any of the 3 original films. And the directing was just terrible. Not to mention, the only characters (aside from Obi-Wan) that I began to care about were killed!Then the 'True Fans' say that you can't compare this film to the original 3. They're right.  The first three had sly humor, sexual tension, and characters that reeked of good or evil.  They had a campy, space cowboy feel.  The Phantom Menace is just a typical big-budget CGI showcase. Lucas' attempt to make this film appeal to both kids and adults just makes it less accessible to either.  After the excitement of the new movie has worn off, I am sure the 'True Fans' will be able to stand back, take an objective look at TPM, and admit that it doesn't fit well with the original trilogy.",5,0,1,20 May 1999
