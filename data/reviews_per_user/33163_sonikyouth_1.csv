Requiem for a Dream," powerful, beautiful expressionist film. completely relative film-making.
","as far as film-making and acting, this is the most powerful, well done movie I've seen. I'm an indie-film enthusiast and have seen many(not bragging) and this was certainly top 5 material, as well as pi, Darren aronofskys first feature-film. when you look at what makes great film-making, you see how what they did relates to the story, and why each shot/edit was chosen to be done the way it was, and i can say that Darren aronofsky got it right. that is why you feel sick after watching the movie, because it was told through the music, through the shots, through the montages and through the acting.nothing was missing and nothing fell short. to relate this to art, and it is one, it is very expressionist. the way the movie is done is a little over the top, but it is believable and it shows emotions. the story, however wasn't anything new or entirely interesting. however the storytelling(film-making, editing etc) makes up for it. it basically is not a drug movie, it is about addiction and what it can lead to. what makes this movie so good is that i could tell you right now a brief summary of what happens and you'd say 'ok' sounds alright, I've probably seen this movie 10 times over, however after seeing this movie you are physically sick. unless you don't care about what is happening or cant follow this movie, i would find it hard to believe this movie didn't make somebody feel disgusted in the least bit.",10,0,1,21 May 2005
