Logan," Best Superhero Movie of 2017
","'Logan' is the best superhero movie of 2017. This marks as the 3rd Wolverine movie and Hugh Jackman's Last film to be portray The Wolverine. This Movie is beyond fantastic.It's impactful, emotional, immersive, just one big helluva ride. just as the film starts, you can tell you're in for a ride of hurt and grit. instead of being upbeat or exhilarating, we see Logan as an Old, depressed, Alcoholic who's in pain and his mutant powers fail to work as well as they used to. He has some trouble getting his claws out, He's unable to heal as he gets bullet's out of his chest and biceps, he even gets beaten down by some Mexican Thugs before he straight up loses it and rips them all apart in a specific R Rated Fashion (Something that didn't happen in the last 8 X-Men Movies). We just see that this series has taken a huge turn in terms of tone.In case it couldn't get more depressing we see Charles Xavier rolling around in his wheel chair quoting and shouting commercial lines in a depressing manner. He has these seizures that causes him and everyone in few feets radius from him to freeze and be unable to do anything. he stops these seizures as soon as he gets the treatment he needs. at one point people get harmed from his super powered seizure and he keeps saying he's sorry. I should also note that this is also Sir Patrick Stewart's Last Film to play Professor Xavier.Dafne Keen play's Laura/X-23 who is a female blood clone of Logan. She's on the run from Cyborg mercenaries who are trying to track her or any other new form of new mutant down. Her Nurse tells Logan to take Laura get her to this place where her and people like Laura can be safe.I'd say this film is the perfect way to say goodbye to Wolverine while giving the fans what they want and let him slaughter any enemy left and right. The Ending has definitely shoced me and left my mouth hanging wondering what's next. but that was it. No Post Credits. No After Credits. It Just Ends.This Film is suspensful, emotional, and impactful in many different ways. definitely woryth a watch.10/10",10,1,1,19 February 2019
