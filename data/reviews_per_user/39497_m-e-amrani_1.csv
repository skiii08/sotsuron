First Man," Wrong plot summary
","Real plot summary:'Neil and his wife are coping with severe depression and they are trying to live their lives as their life goes by. Oh, and Neil is an astronaut.'What's wrong with the movie:* Overly dramatic. They act as if they live in hell* Annoying filming style: shaky hands and a lot of closeups* They forgot to depict the greatness of the huge event, the thing that the movie should be about* Graininess of the film. Can't understand the urge of filmmakers to use grain just because the story happened in the past. As if life itself in the past had noise/grain in it ðŸ¤”",4,2,4,31 October 2018
