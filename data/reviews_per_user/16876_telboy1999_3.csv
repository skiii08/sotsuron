First Man," Dul dull dull dull dulll
","I have absolutely no idea how someone, anyone, can make a movie about quite possibly the most incredible moment in human history and make it so DULL! Honestly this movie is a complete yawn-fest. I had hoped to be moved and thrilled and left in awe...instead I was left feeling 'Is that it?'. This movie sucked all the soul out of an incredible story. Don't bother watching this. It's dreadful. Watch Apollo 13 instead.",Null,10,16,29 October 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," An unworthy cash-in
","I write as a dyed-in-the-wool Star Wars fan. I hated this movie.The actual story is tissue-paper thin and could have been done much better. There is an awful lot of padding - some scenes are as painfully long as an in-game cut-scene that you can't get out of. To make up for lack of story, lots of CGI has been thrown into the mix to try to create a 'wow' factor. It doesn't. All it does is emphasise how weak the story actually is. For me, an adult fan (I'm 50), it was pretty poor but my 6 and 13 year old nephews seemed to enjoy it. Most of the adults seemed to think it was 'OK'.This is not a worthy addition to the canon, unlike The Force Awakens, which was.",Null,17,35,19 December 2016
Arrival," Drivel
","This is possibly the most boring, nonsensical movie I've ever seen. Absolutely nothing happens for the first 30 minutes. Then something happens, but the build-up is so portentous and slow that by the time it happened, I didn't care. And the thing that happened wasn't very exciting or interesting anyway. Nor was the rest of the movie.Arrival is boring, tedious, self-important, lacking any logic or character development...just give it a miss, seriously. Go and watch 2001: A Space Odyssey instead.Apparently my review doesn't contain enough lines. OK. I say again, Arrival is boring, tedious, self-important, lacking any logic or character development...just give it a miss, seriously. Go and watch 2001: A Space Odyssey instead.",Null,7,12,19 December 2016
