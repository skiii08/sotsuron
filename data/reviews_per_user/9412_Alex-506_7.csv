Casablanca," Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.
","I do not like Casablanca.  Wait!  Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out.  One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains.  It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie.  But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level.  Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine.  He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience.  'I stick my neck out for no one', 'Rick never drinks with anyone', etc., etc.   These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out.  Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back.  I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions.  It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine.  The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song 'As Time Goes By'.  But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time.  Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison.  Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened.  It could have been a great and profound film.  Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.**/*****",5,7,16,9 January 2001
Minority Report," A masterpiece...one of Spielberg's very best.
","Other than the incomparable Schindler's List (which is my second favourite film of all-time) and perhaps the wonderful entertainment Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think that this is Steven Spielberg's greatest film.  And that's saying something.To be sure, it is the best film I have seen in 2002.  As a movie lover, I love films that almost get me drunk on the pure excitement of watching it. This is such a film.  I saw it in theaters and bought it on DVD because everytime I watch it, I can look at it through a new angle.If you watch it simply to be dazzled by the vision of the future, it's a masterpiece.  If you watch it to be enveloped in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, it's a masterpiece.  And as a combination of the two, it forges it's own special genre...like Blade Runner meets North by Northwest.Also, there is an element of strong social commentary about the direction that America (and other countries, to be fair) is heading in with its 'protection' of national interests.  We may still be alive, but will we be free?  There is an undeniable horror to two images in the movie: the one in which the halo is about to be put on the man's head at the beginning of the film (the guy who was about to kill his wife) and the one in which Anderton sees himself committing a crime.  How could you talk your way out of it? 'But...I haven't done anything!'.  'Yes, but you will...'There are so many memorable images and moments: I haven't even mentioned the first great chase sequence, the Spyder sequence (which ranks with some of cinema's finest moments) or the oddly romantic 'Moon River' chase sequence in the mall.  These are all moments that transcend any genre and get at the heart of why we go to the movies in the first place.The performances would seem to be irrelevant in a sci-fi movie, but it is typical of Spielberg that they are first-rate.  Tom Cruise really made me care about his character, even the corny missing son bit seemed genuine rather than forced on to forge his character.  And the supporting performances are unforgettable: Samantha Morton as a chilling Pre-Cog, Colin Farrell as the oily Witwer, Max von Sydow as the seemingly paternal head of Pre-Crime.  And the characters Anderton meets along the way: the always creepy Peter Stormare, Lois Smith and Tim Blake Nelson add colour and humour to the story.I think this is a great film...what more needs to be said?  When I first saw the film, I thought it was a masterpiece, although I thought the ending was flawed.  Now, even the ending works for me.  It's still a little bit overexpository (the genius of the crime is better revealed slyly and subtly...but I guess Spielberg wanted to make sure the audience wasn't confused).  However, the ending contains genuine drama and many different shots that would have made Hitchcock proud.  So even though it's the worst part of the film, it's still not bad.But yes, as I said, this is a masterpiece.  If you haven't seen it, it's too bad you missed it in theaters (it really is a great moviegoing experience) but get it on DVD or VHS.  You won't be disappointed.",9,0,0,6 January 2003
American Beauty," I have seen many films in my life, this one is the best.
","No film has ever entertained, enlightened and had such a profound effect on me as Sam Mendes' directorial debut, American Beauty.  The film tells the story of one man's rebellion against the social conventions that he has fallen victim to.  It is also the story of the way his change effects the people around him, and the way that everyone slowly begins to be truer about themselves.  This is one of the most genuine films, it is not afraid to show people at their truest, hiding behind masks to cover who they really are. In my opinion, films have a responsibility to do three things: entertain, enlighten and display great use of cinema.  American Beauty entertains on every viewing, from the comedic elements that stand out as you watch for a first time, to the amazing depth that is revealed on every repeated viewing. Mendes' direction also stands out as a brilliant achievement which rivals the best works of Welles and Bergman.  His visual style is both haunting and mesmerizing, and he develops a subtle pattern of character revelation. Whenever we see characters being their true selves, it is almost always through a window, a mirror or a hand-held camera.  The acting is perhaps the finest work I have seen on film.  Kevin Spacey gives a stellar performance, combining the obvious physical transformation he undergos with the subtle changes in his personality.  Wes Bentley plays the character who knows the truest nature of beauty.  His character Ricky is the film's real hero. Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Mena Suvari and Chris Cooper all succeed in creating apparently caricatured people who reveal subtle and sympathetic reasons for their actions.  This is a film which has reminded me that most people who appear bad are only cowering behind their true selves, they have reasons for their actions which I can not possibly begin to imagine.  This is also a film which has made me realize that life is too short to waste thinking about money or future plans, it should be lived lovingly in the present.  I have seen many great films in my life: Metropolis, M, Citizen Kane, Rear Window, Psycho, Taxi Driver, Schindler's List, and that's just about 1% of the great movies I have seen.  Yet this one, this treasure that was given to us last year, stands out above the rest.  It is the only film that has affected the way I choose to live my life, indeed, one of the only works of art. I am not a suggestable type, but I realize that life should be lived, not planned for, not worried about, just lived.  We should all look for the beauty around us, even in unconventional places.  Seeing American Beauty, I didn't have to look very far.",10,0,0,28 August 2000
Schindler's List," My second favourite movie of all time
","Schindler's List is one of the best movies ever made, for many different reasons.  I could repeat what has already been said on this list about the brilliant acting, direction and cinematography.  But you already know all that stuff.  What makes the film great for me, though, is the way it shows humans at their truest, improvising and scrounging to survive.  This is what life is all about: trying to stay alive no matter what the circumstances around us.The film is amazing in its restraint and subtlety.  It would have been so easy for the movie to step on a soapbox and tell us all about the negative factors that led to the Holocaust.  Instead it simply depicts one little corner of that massive evil, and shows how a few people outsmarted it, and did survive.  The film trusts our own intelligence, and lets us draw our own conclusions about why Schindler changed, and also what the Nazis were like. Another thing I loved about the film is that Spielberg resisted the temptation to paint the Nazis as mindless villains.  Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is seen as having the same passions and mannerisms as Schindler himself.  But somewhere along the line Goeth strayed from the path of good, and from that we can see that the line between good and evil is a fine one.This is a masterful film.  Fantastic acting, superb pacing by Spielberg, beautiful lighting and photography, great music, and extremely intelligent and profound insights into human nature.  What more could you ask?",10,11,16,23 January 2001
Black Hawk Down," Technically well-made but strangely lifeless.
","Black Hawk Down is a technically well-made film that left me feeling strangely unsatisfied and empty.  For all of the hype that I heard concerning the movie's battle scenes, I found them to be incoherent and for the most part, overrated.  Some have said that this film deserves comparison to Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan.  I feel that Apocalypse Now is in a far better category, and even though I had some problems with Saving Private Ryan, it still packed more of a wallop.The problem with Black Hawk Down is that it seems to be a cinematic void. It doesn't really have much of a direction, other than almost two hours of gunfire spraying the streets of Somalia.  As an accurate representation of what happened in Somalia, I am sure it is superb.  However, I go to the movies to become involved in a story, although not necessarily through identification with the characters (Apocalypse Now and The Thin Red Line are good examples of war movies without lovable characters that involved me). However, Black Hawk Down was void of any real connection for me, so that by the end, I was just staring at the screen.Part of this is due to the way that Scott chooses to present the horrors that happened on October 3, 1993.  By consistently barraging us with gunfire and RPGs exploding, we are actually desensitized.  There is none of the surprise or suspense of Saving Private Ryan.  I understand that this is a film based on a true story, and not an action film designed to deliver cheap thrills, but it comes across more as a nonstop shooting gallery.  Some of the best moments in the film are the quiet ones: the helicopters flying over the beaches before what is supposed to be a routine mission, the eerie sight of an empty city in prayer for only a few fleeting minutes, and the silent running of the American soldiers back to their base.  But these moments are few and far between, and they only offer glimpses of the truly chilling war picture this might have been.Some have complained that this film is racist because it does not present the views of the Somalians or explain why some of the civilians acted the way they did.  This is a legitimate complaint, but it did not bother me, because the movie makes it clear early on that it is about the soldiers and what they went through.  I was really looking forward to a film which actually contemplated what it was like to be a soldier, not knowing what to do next or whether you had been abandoned.  Unfortunately, the film, while offering glimmers of my hope, also provided ample war movie cliches.  By the third time a dying soldier said 'Tell so-and-so so-and-so', I almost rolled my eyes.In a film with hundreds of different actors, only two really left me with any memory whatsoever.  Josh Hartnett (who I'm usually not a big fan of) was excellent in his role as the meditative sergeant who is actually afraid to be where he is.  The other actor is the always reliable character actor Tom Sizemore, who creates a strong character out of only a few lines. Unfortunately, other strong talents like Ewan MacGregor are largely wasted. I understand that this is not by nature an actor's movie, and I wasn't hoping for cliche caricatures, just some human connection to make me care when the bullets started hitting the soldiers.To the film's credit, it does delve into some of the fears felt by the soldiers in a situation like this.  The film gets better as it goes along, as nighttime falls, we feel an eeriness.  Scott does an excellent job of actually taking us to this city with all of its chaos and fear.  But as with most of Scott's films, the technical brilliance is overshadowed by a curious lack of any connection to anything.  Even the impressive camerawork left me with only fleeting memories of memorable shots.  And I still can't think of one scene that I could call great in the movie (by contrast, Apocalypse Now is virtually one stringed after another).  Black Hawk Down, for all of its technical superiority, could have been so much more with just a shred of spine.  Instead, we have a film that is better than most of what Hollywood offers, but still very disappointing.Rating: 58/100.",5,0,0,18 January 2002
A Beautiful Mind," Overrated, standard fare.
","Ron Howard's A Beautiful Mind, which I just witnessed win Best Picture, is middle-brow, typical fare.  It is most definitely not Howard's best work (that would be Apollo 13, in my opinion).  While Jennifer Connelly gives an excellent performance, Russell Crowe has been a lot better.  Yet this is the kind of performance people often fall for, giving credit to the role's challenges than to the actual connection we have to the actor.  Yes, Crowe is techincally excellent (although his accent slides a little).  But is it a performance that inspires us or reflects ourselves?  I think not.  Crowe's performance was nowhere near the level of Tom Wilkinson in In The Bedroom.There are some pluses to the film: The aforementioned solid acting, a genuine attempt to put into cinematic terms the mind-boggling (pardon the pun) disease of schizophrenia (which someone in my own family suffers from). Although the film has been attacked by those who say that Nash's life hasn't been put into accurate context, my question is: who cares?  You don't seen biopics for hard facts unless you are a fool.  Just look at Nixon, Raging Bull, and others.  As long as the film itself is effective in portraying its character, that's all that matters.  A Beautiful Mind also contains some great moments.  My favourite is when Jennifer Connelly lets out one instant of frustration, smashing the glass in the bathroom.  It is so shocking and emerges from such quiet that the effect is quite profound.But the problems outweigh the strengths.  Some complaints:1.  The musical score is atrocious.  I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar.  It is saccharine, violin-heavy, tearjerking and shameless.2.  The disease of schizophrenia is grossly simplified.  The fact that Crowe has these three characters who are so clearly obvious in what aspect of his psyche that they represent is a cheap trick.3.  The second half of the film becomes grossly repetitive.  We see Crowe walking, we see his POV of either Big Brother or his roommate or the little girl, and then he continues on in the face of his disease.  There were about SEVEN scenes like this.  I was growing bored...4.  There are too many Hollywood moments.  The little musical chord that strikes when we first see an aged Crowe and Connelly (Oh...how touching...they're still together after all of these years).  And worse is the episode with a beautiful woman that inspires Crowe to come up with his mathematic theory.5.  The mathematic theory isn't explained in nearly enough detail.  We are only told that Nash's work 'changed modern economics'.  Howard doesn't trust that the audience has the patience or the intelligence to be told how.6.  Back to the Hollywood moments.  I hate it in movies when we see something happen to a character in their twenties, and then this resonates while they are in their sixties.  We have just seen these things happen a few hours ago.  They happened a lifetime ago for the characters.  I know we remember some things forever, but A Beautiful Mind really stretched this effect.  Examples: the hankerchief that Alicia gives John, the phrase 'petrified, stupified, etc.' that John mocks his friend/adversary with when offered to play a game, and the full-circle effect of John receiving all the pens in that special room where he had once been snubbed.  (How touching...pass the hankerchief).  John may have been so deeply imprinted with rejection when he saw another man receiving the tribute, so it is possible that this would still have some resonance.  But the hankerchief is a typical Howardian Hollywood ploy.  And are we really supposed to believe that John remembers the exact order of words that he said to a man who offered to play a game with him FORTY-SEVEN YEARS AGO!!!!  Give me a break.I am not a cynic who doesn't like feel-good movies.  But the movies have to earn it, and A Beautiful Mind did not.  There are too many flaws in this picture to recommend it.  Rather, I would give it about a 60/100.  This continues a poor and long stretch of mistakes by the Academy in handing out the Best Picture (excluding Schindler's List and American Beauty).  Of the last TWELVE Best Picture winners, I have only really enjoyed four: the aforementioned Schindler's List and American Beauty (my two favourite films of all-time), Unforgiven and Forrest Gump.  Is something wrong with me?  Or is it the Academy?  Obviously, you know what I think.",5,4,9,24 March 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," One of my five favourite movies of all time.
","The Shawshank Redemption is one of the wisest and most touching films I have ever seen.  It tells the tale of the friendship between two convicted murderers: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). Many things make this a good film: its genuine depiction of prison life, the wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, the great music from Thomas Newman.  For all of these qualities, The Shawshank Redemption is worth seeing.What makes the film great for me, though, is the way that in its depiction of prison life, the film becomes an existential display of how most of us live our own lives.  ***SPOILER AHEAD***  Throughout the film, we are confronted by how people choose to accept their freedom.  Brooks, the old librarian, who has been in prison for almost his entire life, becomes scared of the freedom he enjoys, and can not take it.  The same fate almost befalls Red, but his redemption comes as he is able to accept the unpredictability of his life, and draw inspiration from Andy.  The film rings absolutely true, I know many people who are too afraid to chase after their own dreams, and would rather stay in a mundane yet predictable and secure job.  'Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine,' Red says in the course of the film.  So, I imagine, do many people's lives.  The Shawshank Redemption is about breaking away from the routine, taking risks, and going after your dreams without compromise.",10,0,0,12 January 2001
