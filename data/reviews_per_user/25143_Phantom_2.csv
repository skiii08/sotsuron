The Blair Witch Project," Scary...So Very Scary.
","If I had to say one thing about this movie it would be...Wow.  It was so scary that my heart would start beating faster during some parts.  It was great, it was so intense that when the movie had a quiet part, nobody in the theatre was talking.  It was so quiet that you could have heard a pin drop. It was great.  If you have the chance to see it, Please do!  You'll be very happy you did.  This is the scariest movie I have ever seen. Enjoy!",10,1,2,18 July 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Very, VERY, Funny!
","For those of you who are wondering if you should spend your money going to see South Park, I just want to say, YES!  This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time!  The songs are so funny I thought I was going to hurt myself from laughing so hard!  But, there is one thing I should say, this movie is not for children.  But young adults and adults will have the time of their lives!  Bravo to Matt Stone and Trey Parker!  South Park is back!  And a wonderful way of coming back!  This is all I could ask for in a movie.  Great songs, funny script, and all the making fun of Saddam Hussian, makes for a great movie!!!",10,0,0,1 July 1999
