Vertigo," People Call Hitchcock One of the Greatest for a Reason
","SPOILER FREE REVIEW:Hitchcock is considered one of history's greatest directors for a reason. Watching through Vertigo one time straight through gives an amazing experience. The characters are intriguing, the plot is suspenseful, and has many twists and turns, like you are falling through spiraling mayhem.****************************SPOILERS AHEAD********************************* From the beginning of the film we have one of the greatest opening credits sequences of all time. The close up shots of a face, followed by spinning shapes and spirals. As irrelevant as this credits sequence may seem the first time around, it quite literally delves into the mind of Scottie (James Stewart), our protagonist. The way he perceives Madeline (Kim Novak) is not as a person clearly, but for who she is as an object. He doesn't see her as a full person. That is why from the opening credits, we see features of a woman on there own, separate from the rest of the body. These spirals represent how Scottie feels with the chaos ensuing in his life throughout the film, and his vertigo.
 
 Another brilliant subtle use of imagery in the film is with color. In particular, the colors red and green, for stop and go. The first time I watched the film, this imagery totally went past me. Although I was in a class where the teacher was analyzing the film, and this suddenly became almost too obvious. In nearly every scene featuring Scottie and Madeline/Judy, the colors red and green are very present, whether it be the lighting in the space, their clothing, the wallpaper the room, or even something as simple as a reflection.
 
 The one element I didn't love in Vertigo which many people would disagree with is the ending. I really loved the buildup as Scottie follows Judy up the tower in the final scene, and he slowly builds up in his anger revealing he has caught on to the whole scheme, but I found the very ending bizarre, and was given no good explanation to it. My assumption was at the ending there would be some sort of intense final dialogue between Judy and Scottie at the top of the tower, and Scottie would dramatically either commit suicide, kill Judy, or just something very intense, but the way that Judy dies didn't make much sense to me, or make me feel the film had a satisfying ending. She dies because some nun we've never seen before startles her. Why does this happen and what does it mean? I read somewhere that she thought the nun is a ghost, but why is that relevant? When the movie ended the first time I watched it, I thought to myself, that was weird, although I'm sure I'll find some complex mind blowing explanation online. Nothing. If someone can link me to a great explanation of who that nun is, and what she represents, it would be appreciated.",10,7,9,26 April 2018
Us," Watch Us a Second Time (SPOILERS AND FAN THEORIES AHEAD)
","So I just came out of the theater from seeing Us a second time. The first time I watched Us, I very much enjoyed it. I found it to be funny, suspenseful, and the ending completely caught me by surprise, but there were things that left me confused. I felt I had missed certain details that could have potentially added to my viewing experience. Then I went back to see Us for the second time and I felt so much more of the film worked. It became clear that something was wrong with Adelaide from the beginning and I was suddenly shocked that the rest of the audience had no idea. I also had heard a theory since my first viewing of the movie that Jason also was switched out like his mother (likely on an earlier trip to Santa Cruz), which the film also hints to numerous times. These clues include the fact that he cannot work his magic toy, but his tethered version can, he is the only family member who seems to figure out that Adelaide isn't who she says she is, he knows words that he shouldn't, and Adelaide seems to potentially realize the tethered Jason is the real Jason when he steps into the fire in the third act of the film. She suddenly seems to be at a loss when this happens, moments after she is about to kill him herself. Anyways, these are all just theories of course but I really do believe the film has a lot to offer and does make at least enough sense to work as a movie. Of course no movie makes perfect sense, and this film is no exception.",9,24,52,24 March 2019
Ready Player One," Ready Player One From the Perspective of a VR Geek
","If you want to see this movie because you like virtual reality see it now, you don't even need to go in with any details, you will enjoy it. The same goes if you either are a hardcore 80s kid, or just anyone who loves 80s music, movies, video games, etc. If you don't have interest in any of those areas, you may want to hear someone out before going.
 
 I for one have both always been into 80s music and film (I happen to be 18 by the way), and I call myself a VR enthusiast, so this movie really was a thrill for me. Yeah, it is no Citizen Kane, and Spielberg has done better, but I really loved this movie. From the rise of the Oculus Rift a couple years ago I was so into the idea of virtual reality. I even remember when I was a young chap, I had some totally cheapo Power Rangers 'virtual reality' where you strapped sensors onto your arms and legs with velcro, and wore this incredibly bulky plastic visor, and you punched and kicked when flashing images of villains appeared in your sight (if you really are curious what I'm talking about, just search for Power Rangers Virtual Reality and you'll find it pretty quickly). But literally, just around the same time I thought that piece of trash was revolutionary, Oculus started up on Kickstarter in 2012, finally going to the consumer market in 2016. I both always saw a future in virtual reality, and really wanted it because it is so damn cool. Unfortunately due to its high price tag, it will be some time until everyone has one of these in their household. The hardest part actually is acquiring a computer which can handle it. For me, I modded my computer to be compatible (in fact it was actually just below Oculus required specs). One of the things I get whenever I tell someone I am invested in VR is, 'Virtual reality is dying.' I happen to disagree. VR is still in the works, and I'm just wanted to get on that VR train early on. I believe the Oculus Go will actually be a good boost for VR given its semi affordable price (which will probably go down) and its portability. So to finally talk about VR in the movie, which I haven't even touched upon yet, it seems really far in the future. Yes it is in the future, but not even as far as you may think. Upon my first time watching RPO (I saw it twice), I thought 'Damn, that movie was awesome, but VR like that is really far away.' Well guess what? It actually isn't (for the most part). The hardest part to achieve is getting that full field of view that is projected into your eyes via lasers. That really was the one part that seemed a bit far from us at the moment. Although VR manufacturers are indeed very focused on widening field of view, and upping resolution. The technological elements of the film that really are reasonable to see in the future, are the use of haptics, and the omnidirectional treadmill. The treadmill seems to be them furthest advanced of the technologies we see in the film, being there already are a couple startups that already have produced treadmills that almost exactly match what we see in RPO. Of course the technology isn't perfect, but it is very close to what we see in the movie. Haptics by means of vibrations we already have access to, but what we see in the movie is a bit more advanced, allowing to recreate realistic feelings of touch and resistance. This is still in the early stages, but is out there. Haptx is a VR startup which has created haptic gloves filled with hundreds of sensors and mechanical parts allowing one to feel just about anything one can imagine feeling on their hand, from a tiny fox walking on it, to individual raindrops, to picking small objects up. Now that I've said quite a bit about the technology in RPO, I'll get more to the content. The movie is so jam packed with detail you'll need to view it frame by frame to catch it all. From avatars from games like Overwatch, to sectors of the Oasis called Minecraft World, the movie really gets everything in there. I also really enjoyed the music choices in the film, being 80s hits. A favorite scene from the movie (which I will not spoil) of mine literally recreates shots and locations from one of my favorite films of all time, an 80s classic (better see it if you want to know what that is). The one thing I will say, is this film kind of is a love it or hate it scenario. My brothers and I loved the movie, and spent hours discussing it, and how VR can change the future, while someone else I saw it with hated it, and said, 'Oh it's literally just copying Willy Wonka.' To this anonymous person's defense, it does take a lot from Willy Wonka (humble poor kid invests himself into competition where reward is unlimited riches, and his humility allows him to beat those who try to win using money and ignorance), but that doesn't make it a bad film. This still is completely its own concept, focused around the very much new, modern idea of VR. So if you are a VR geek, see it. If you are an 80s nerd, see it. If you aren't, I still definitely recommend you at least give it a shot, but by no means is it a must see.",9,0,1,2 May 2018
The Shining," A Movie That Truly Haunts you
","A movie that doesn't necessarily make you jump out of your seat, but will haunt you and crawl into your mind when you least expect it. First to clear this up, if you are familiar with Stephen King's opinion on this movie, put that to the side before watching it. Forget the fact that there even is a book... It doesn't matter. To fully appreciate Kubrick's work on The Shining appreciate it as its own work of art, not as a recreation of the book. I for one have read and enjoyed both the book and the movie, and love them both, but for different reasons.
Kubrick is truly a God with sounds in his movies. This applies to many of his movies from The Shining, to 2001: A Space Odyssey, to A Clockwork Orange, etc. I think The Shining is one of the best films ever in the usage of sounds and music. If one were to watch The Shining with the music from Seinfeld, and put a laugh track over it, the film totally can be sold as a comedy. Maybe to do that some of the gore would have to be removed though... But truly, the sound is one of the key components of what makes the film work so well. One of the sounds unique to this film is the intense violin noise which I discovered months after seeing the movie for the film for the first time is akin to the sound of a broken down escalator (look out for that noise the next time you're on an old escalator, you won't be disappointed).
Another piece of the film that allows it to stand out so much is the unique creepy cinematography. The way hallways seem so long and eerie, the shot of Danny on his tricycle going around the main floor (the sounds of his tricycle going on and off of the carpet is amazing too), the shot of the two twins from afar, and the twisty shots through the maze.
The acting is brilliant too (from some of the cast), making you fear Jack Nicholson, although you may laugh a bit at Shelley Duvall as she throws a fit swinging a bat around like a maniac (fun fact, the reason Shelley Duvall was probably having trouble keeping herself together in reality because that scene took 127 takes to film).
So for anyone who is a fan of horror movies, but want something more than just a guy jumping out of the woods with a machete, here is a movie where you truly get into the mind of the crazy guy with an axe.",10,0,2,24 April 2018
Avengers: Endgame," This IS the End(game)
","So, I have been going to all the Marvel movies since I was 8 years old when the first Iron Man came out. Since then it's been a part of my life that when Marvel would drop a new movie I'd be going whether that meant going with my brother or with friends. I always really took those movies and it's characters for granted. And I have to say, I couldn't ask for them to wrap up the Avengers saga in a better more emotional or entertaining way. I have never cried in a Marvel movie before, but this movie shed tears at least twice for me. For me this was a combination of the film's excellence and the sadness I faced seeing such a big part of my childhood come to a wrap. If you grew up with the Avengers like I did I have a feeling you'll feel the same, and even if you're not a hardcore fan, it makes a really fun and thrilling watch even with its 3 hour runtime.",10,1,5,26 April 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," An Honest Review from a Non-Marvel Fan
","So first I'll tell you this. I never loved Marvel movies, so this is unbiased, and more critical of Infinity War as a film, not as just a Marvel movie. If you are a hardcore Marvel fan, and you for some reason did not see it opening weekend, you should still see it despite it's not being the best of Marvel. It is not an objectively terrible movie, it just isn't really as strong as some other Marvel productions. But you certainly will like it being a fan of Marvel, but probably not if you aren't into the style/genre.SPOILERS AHEAD: Now to get deeper, this movie will make you leave the theater thinking, 'What the hell?' This goes for Marvel fans and everyone else. Despite my not loving Superhero movies, I have seen all of the Avengers Films, and most of the major Marvel films of the past 10 years. I've seen the Captain America Movies, the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies (not the Thor sequel because it was supposed to be god awful), etc. This movie though was different. Although the Avengers movies do rely on having all of the Marvel star heroes unite, this one tried something even more insane, which was having pretty much every single Marvel franchise of the past 10 years combine (with a few exceptions), which was wayyy more than in the past. And frankly, too much for a two and a half hour movie (although if the solution were to extend this movie I would have walked out or fell asleep).I favor the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise over the other Marvel franchises. And I feel that way not because of the character depth, but I like its style and genre. Marvel movies do this. They change the genre in the different franchises to make them suit different kinds of people. Guardians of the Galaxy was a fun adventure saga with lots of colors and effects backed by an epic mixtape. Captain America was war movie style. Deadpool (not in Infinity War) is comedy, and one of the few of their movies to receive the R rating. And these genres are good alone, but kinda weird to combine. Guardians of the Galaxy for example totally does not fit in to Infinity War. The sole reason it does is the Gamora Thanos connection, which was clearly formed in Guardians of the Galaxy for the sole reason to get that Thanos connection in, because everyone has to have some connection to Thanos and therefore the Infinity Stones to be in this movie. And I'm not saying they should have been removed from this movie and left a standalone. They were necessary for the plot, but only because Marvel made them necessary. Saying that, Marvel does deserve credit for making almost every franchise in Infinity War relevant somehow. Black Panther though wasn't really needed, they only really used Wakanda as a battlefront, and their technology was used on Vision, but they could have gotten the tech elsewhere.
Now, about that ending. This ending is so completely far fetched that while leaving the movie, one of the theater attendants said something like, 'I'm sorry that was so disappointing.' Even though it was 'sad' to see so many characters cease to exist, remember, even though Infinity War is symbolizing the end of a lot of characters (contracts), there is another Avengers movie in post production right now, so we can assume that it will have a happy ending of sorts, because unfortunately Hollywood doesn't have the balls anymore to leave a multi-billion dollar franchise on a sad note. Not that I want the characters dead, but my call is that everyone comes back to life again, leaving on a happy note, which is kind of clichÃ©, and it bothers me. My prediction is the remaining Avengers hunt down Thanos one final time, with the goal of retrieving his glove, and destroying the Infinity Stones, but first they use the time stone to reverse time, and bring everyone back to life again (probably discounting Gamora and Loki; I swear if Loki comes back to life one more time...) But anyways, the movie was fine, but just a bit overboard on the characters, a bit too long, and overhyped.",7,1,2,7 May 2018
2001: A Space Odyssey," A Movie You Truly Feel Inside of
","While watching a film, you get the most out of it by truly feeling immersed. You don't just want to watch events happening on a screen and think it's amusing or cool, but you really want to feel in. Feeling in is one of the most groundbreaking qualities of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. From his unique cinematography style to the use of music, you truly feel immersed watching this film. After watching this film, Strauss's Blue Danube cannot be listened to without associating it with this film. The same applies to Also sprach Zarathustra, which almost seems it was made to be in this work.
 2001 truly uses every element a perfect film needs. From the first scene, The Dawn of Man, one of the most brilliant film transitions of all time can be found, the transition of a bone to a spaceship. These both are symbols of the evolution of man, from the original tool, to the revolutionary spaceship. The way Kubrick makes time so important is extraordinary completely inspecting and digging into major philosophical questions, like 'What is mankind?' and 'Why are we here?' One of the other reasons I applaud Kubrick for, is he doesn't even know the answers. Or at least, he chooses not to share them saying:'They are the areas I prefer not to discuss because they are highly subjective and will differ from viewer to viewer. In this sense, the film becomes anything the viewer sees in it. If the film stirs the emotions and penetrates the subconscious of the viewer, if it stimulates, however inchoately, his mythological and religious yearnings and impulses, then it has succeeded.'
Stanley Kubrick in an interview with Joseph Gelmis Many messages can be taken from the film, but all of them have some sort of a missing piece. That missing piece can be the question as to what the monolith is, or what a baby in space is, but do we really need to know? As Stanley Kubrick was a genius, maybe he prefers us having some sort of a missing piece. 2001 clearly is making some sort of a statement about the greed of modern humanity, always feeling to know everything. We evolve from being dumb apes who bow down to what we don't know, to overconfident astronauts that feel the need to take a picture with our confusing findings. Maybe the fact that we are confused is attempting to make a large philosophical realization about the fact that not knowing is okay. Or maybe it's just to make a good film. But either way, 2001 can still be greatly appreciated as one of the most complex, immersive, and even almost perfect film creations of all time.",10,2,3,24 April 2018
The Sixth Sense," Shyamalan's Best
","The Sixth Sense without a doubt is the best work of M. Night Shyamalan I have ever seen (I haven't seen all of his movies for a reason). The Sixth Sense is my second favorite horror movie I have ever seen, following Kubrick's The Shining. Although I do believe The Sixth Sense is the most frightening horror film I have ever seen, making me jump even after seeing it a handful of times. The movie isn't exactly a jumpscare kind of movie, but I think it has some of the most brilliant jumpscares I have ever seen. My favorite being while Cole stands in the bathroom in the middle of the night, and we see the lower body of a woman abruptly walk past the doorway when we were under the impression he was alone. Also, the scene where he hides from the young girl is terrifying, actually making me think of the young girls from The Shining. Of course, the best part of the movie indeed is the ending. The plot twist of this film is truly up there with some of the most brilliant plot twists of all time like those from Hitchcock in Vertigo and Psycho. Watching the film a second time is truly crucial for this film, because Shyamalan is so good at covering up the ending, you totally will miss every single clue you are given, despite the clues being EVERYWHERE. Malcolm never once talks to any other person the entire film other than Cole. As much as you may convince yourself he was talking with his wife, think again, because every time he approached him, she did not say a word to him. She mumbles a word or two under her breath a few times, but these words are not directed towards anyone. On top of that, Cole numerous times describes the traits he has learned about ghosts in his time seeing them, and his descriptions so perfectly describe Malcolm's character. The movie truly does bring one of the most brilliant plot twists ever, but unfortunately Shyamalan hasn't brought us much more since.",9,1,1,2 May 2018
The Godfather," You Can't Call Yourself A Film Lover if you Haven't Seen This
","Is The Godfather my favorite film ever made? No, but it definitely is one of the best movies out there. Not only does it follow an incredibly complex story, but it is filmed beautifly, and the acting from Marlon Brando and Al Pacino is brilliant. If you call yourself a film buff and haven't seen The Godfather, you definitely have some work to do.
 I saw The Godfather for the first time when I was probably around 14 or 15, and had some trouble fully grasping why people love it so much. But again, I was young and probably just thought to myself, oh, the movie's old so it's boring. Boring however is definitely not a word to describe this film. It is the complete opposite of boring, with more suspense than just about any other movie ever made. Coppola did not want a movie which was from start to finish mafia gangsters shooting at each other, but instead a movie that makes you bite your nails either hoping for a character to survive or the opposite... The characters (originally from Mario Puzo's book) are either characters you root for, or they are terrible people who don't deserve to live. One of the humanizing elements that is critical to numerous characters in the film is their love for their families. Marlon Brando's character of Vito Corleone is a terrible man, who has had dozens if not hundreds of people killed before, but he has a deep love and care for his family.
 To sum up what I think about this film without spoiling anything, even if you're not into the mafia genre, if you are a person who claims to like film, this movie is absolutely a must see.",10,1,1,24 April 2018
