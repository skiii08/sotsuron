The Avengers," awesome..........
","OK.! i rushed into the afternoon show with my brother at the cinema. i didn't expect much, because i thought to many cooks may spoil the broth... but as the movie began... awesome...!! superb action.. last one hour was terrific. Hulk rocked in the movie. all were great. the best cgi i have ever seen.. i recommend its a must watch. i have seen it 3 times in theaters. the story lacks something.. but everything is covered up by the humor, action, and lots and lots of cgi graphics.. the movie rocks. waiting for avengers 2. and as per 3d... i recommend u wont miss anything much in 2d..the best scene in the movie was when Bruce banner turns into hulk and punches into the alien.",10,0,2,29 April 2012
