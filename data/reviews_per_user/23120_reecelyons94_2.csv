Hereditary," Awful movie
","I have no idea why this film has such a high score on IMDB. The film starts with some promise and seems like it could be a good film, but it never picks up. The storyline is so bad and don't even get me started on how bad the ending is. Also for a horror film, it isn't scary in the slightest and has absolutely no jump scares.",2,3,8,16 June 2018
A Quiet Place," Best horror/thriller in a long time
",This movie was a nice change to the usual horror/thrillers which are all the same. It had me on edge the entire film. I really enjoyed it and would definitely recommend. Best horror/thriller I've seen in such a long time.,9,285,585,2 April 2018
