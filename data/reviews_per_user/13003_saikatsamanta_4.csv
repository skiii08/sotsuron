Your Name.," Makes even a cynical person believe in the magic of love...
","Body swapping subgenre has mostly been used to make cute comedies which has very less to say. But Makoto Shinkai uses it to not only show love can be magical, but blends in the financial depression that youth has to face and the constant fear of natural disasters that the world faces everyday. The Visual Artistry is beyond amazing. This one should be seen by every Anime Lover.",9,0,0,1 March 2020
127 Hours," A gritty story of life...
","Based on a true story of a man who got his hand crushed under a rock in the canyons and spent 5 days without any help, Danny Boyle directs this film about the indomitable desire of living with artistic prowess. Amazing cinematography, dynamic editing and great score given by AR Rahman, elevates this film to greatness. James Franco gave a solid performance.",8,0,0,25 May 2020
La La Land," Musical doesn't interest me, But the Love Story is worth watching.
","At first glance, this looked like a musical throwback to the Golden Era of Hollywood where artists come with dreams in their eyes and love for the art. But it became an amazing Love Story. Their dreams brought them together and those dreams pushed them away, but what remained were the memories, the innocence, the what-ifs and the love.
Emma Stone is outstanding and direction of Damien Chazelle is praiseworthy, a worthy follow-up to the electric 'Whiplash'. Do watch this one.",8,0,2,27 March 2020
12 Years a Slave," The Demon that Slavery was...
","In my life, no other film made my blood boil and shattered my heart like this one did. It shows the demon called Slavery in its most horrifying avatar with scene after scene of such terror that battered my conscience and soul repeatedly. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyongo gave legendary performances. Amazing direction, screenplay and cinematography. This film is a Perfect Ten !!!",10,0,1,1 May 2020
