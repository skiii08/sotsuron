Casablanca," One of the best movies ever made
","This is one of the best movies of all time. Anyone who claims to be a fan of the movies needs to see this film. The story, ostensibly about people fleeing the nazi's in World War Two could be set anywhere there are refugees today. There are oppressors, people seeking a better life, those that prey on them and the cynical ones that float with the tides. The whole range of human emotions and activities are seen in this movie. Bogie was never better than he was as Rick, the owner of a cafe in Casablanca where the refugees hang out gambling and drinking and waiting for their chance to leave. Ingrid Bergman was never better than she was as Ilsa Lund, Rick's former lover and husband of resistance leader Victor Lazlo(Paul Henreid). The interplay between Bogie and Bergman would make this film one of the best. But there's more. The ensemble cast includes some of the best character actors together in one film. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet put in strong performances(albeit brief ones) as those who prey on the refugees. Claude Raines, the chief of police, is the perfect bureaucrat who rolls with the tides supporting whoever is on top and knowing it will change. While Bogie never did say 'here's looking at you, kid,', Raines did say 'round up the usual suspects.'I won't spoil the ending, but if you're not crying because of Bogie's nobility and Bergmans pure love for both Rick and her husband, you're not human. This movie is a 10.",10,1,3,4 August 2005
Pearl Harbor," should be burned
","This is one of the worst movies of all time. We are lead to believe that two fighter pilot buddies happen to reunite in Hawaii the night before Pearl Harbor. Before that they were on Long Island, New York together before one goes off to England to fight the Germans. Then, somehow, he gets transferred back to the USAAC from the RAF in the middle of World War Two to go to Hawaii to be ready for the Japanese attack. yeah, right. All of those ships the Japanese destroyed in the attack look suspiciously modern, too. I don't think the US Navy had Aegis class guided missile destroyers in 1941. Yet, those are what the movie shows getting sunk. Then, the final coupe de grace, and if this is giving away the ending, it doesn't really matter since the movie doesn't really matter(as a piece of film, it should be burned/ as a piece of cinematographic art is should be placed in a trash can and as a reflection of history it doesn't even shine a dim light of truth) the fighter pilot from England and Long Island leads the first bomber raid on Tokyo. This would've been bad war propaganda in 1942 and is even worse as 'history' in 2002. Every actor in this film should have their credits changed to 'anonymous' and the directors, producers, and writers banned for producing banal tripe. It sucks.",1,2,4,13 September 2005
The Graduate," The Graduate
","How can you make a movie any better than this? This is the movie that made Dustin Hoffman a great star. Director Mike Nichols always seems to bring out the best in female characters as he certainly did with Anne Bancroft as Mrs. Robinson,a bored socialite who has an affair with her daughter's boyfriend. And who can not love the wonderful Simon and Garfunkle soundtrack. This film is about a young man fresh out of college and trying to find his way in the world. It pushed the envelope in 1967 and is one of those classic films that is just as good to watch now as it was when it was new. It is a definite must see for anyone's list.",10,1,3,7 June 2005
