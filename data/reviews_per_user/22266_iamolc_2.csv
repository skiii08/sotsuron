Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Who's More Stupid?
","Myself for renting the DVD of this thing, or the reviewers who thought it amounted to something? Either way, that's the point: Borat thinks it's exposing stupidity and even venality, but it's just worthless. You get an accurate read on the nature of a society by interviewing its members, letting them speak for themselves--NOT by provoking them into behavior that puts them in a bad light. In fact, most of the responses to Borat's antics are pretty restrained, which is a credit to the Americans involved.A rational response to this unbelievably crude and boorish character would probably involve jail, a baseball bat, or a gun, depending on your taste and tolerance for insult after insult.The real significance of Borat is summarized in the title of a recent book about the consumer economy: Everything for Sale. Including this dreck. I'll give Baron Cohen credit for one thing: He illustrates the maxim that nobody ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public. Cohen is laughing all the way to the bank. I already wasted $4.00 renting the movie: Everyone who hasn't seen it, keep your money. Enough is enough.",1,6,13,18 March 2007
Mission: Impossible II," Pity the Middle Child
","It's been said that the middle child often has more adjustment problems than the other two. In film trilogies, even unintended ones like I suspect the MI franchise of being, the middle film often falls short of either the first or the last. A classic example is Back to the Future II, which was as dark and repellent as I and III were attractive and whimsical.MI:II is the film to avoid in this trilogy. MI was intriguing in its exploration of the classic film question 'What if?' What if Jim Phelps had tired of always being the underpaid civil servant and gone for the gold? Brian De Palma develops his answer in a wonderfully nuanced and compelling way. The scene in which a resurrected Jim tries to film-flam Ethan Hunt is delightful. As Jim describes Kittridge, the alleged force behind all the violence, as tiring of his 60K yearly salary, his rotten marriage, and his obsolescence, Ethan realizes Jim is describing himself and everything falls into place. The later chase aboard the TGV is almost believable.Hardly anything is believable in MI:II. Worse than that, the plot is derivative in the extreme. Besides recapitulating Hitchcock's Notorious, director Woo draws on Star Trek for the opening scene in Moab.....Terminator II for the shootout in the Biocyte lab.....Star Trek again for the infected person who needs the antidote.....Terminator II again for Luther blowing up cars with huge cannon shells. The love triangle is an old one that wastes Thandi Newton's considerable talent. The motorcycle chase near the end reinforces the too-widely held perception that all riders are psychotic yahoos.Still, the film is OK for what it is: A third-rate shoot-em-up. The photography of Australia isn't bad, either.",2,1,2,25 August 2007
