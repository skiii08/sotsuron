Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A squandered opportunity for greatness.
","First, some positives.  Liam Neeson and Ewan Mcgregor are great as Jedi. This movie is easily one of the best looking films ever made.  The Pod race scene is fun.  The final fight is fun.  The Gungans aren't Ewoks.Now, the real review: this movie was even more disappointing than I expected it to be.  Reasons: *The good dialogue is non-existent. For those that disagree, wait 5 years and then give me one cool line that you remember from this film.  I can give you at least 10 from Star Wars, even more from Empire, and even a few from Return.  There is perhaps one bit of even remotely memorable dialogue in this film. *The mediocre dialogue comes in vast quantities, usually when you wish something was happening.  The guy sitting next to me growled during one scene 'When will they stop talking!' *The 2 most important alien races are ethnic stereotypes and completely out of place.  One race speaks just like Charlie Chan, and I kept expecting the Gungans to pull out Bongs and start Jamming to Shaggy. *Jake Lloyd, who plays Anakin Skywalker, is a giant pit of anti-coolness that sucks every ounce of coolness from every scene he is in like a black hole.  I cannot believe that he was the best Lucas could come up with for this part.  His lines are straight from a 'Leave it to Beaver' episode and he has the emotional depth of a block of balsa wood. *There is little emotion of any kind.  Anakin and his mother act like they hardly know each other.  Darth Maul looks evil, but hardly has enough screen time to build up vague unease, let alone menace in the audience.  The Jedi, admittedly, are supposed to be emotionless, and yet they show more depth of feeling than any other characters. *The absolutely absurd description of the Force as mediated by microscopic organisms.  This sudden shift in description brings to mind the backstory whiplash of Highlander II.Overall, this film is the biggest disappointment of a film I have seen in a very long time, and this is from a person who was expecting it to be pretty bad.  Please wait to til this one hits second run before you waste time on it.  $7 to $9 is just too much to pay.",4,0,1,19 May 1999
The Mummy," A fairly fun movie that doesn't know what it wants to be.
","The Mummy is a passable attempt at a rollicking fantasy adventure. However, the film could have been much more.  The acting is average, although Brendan Fraser does surprisingly well as the roguish hero.  The plot is straightforward, and the action keeps up throughout the film.  But there is something missing from this film.  Some of the action is quite gruesome, as if the filmmakers were taking a stab at true horror.  However, the scenes seem out of place with most of the rest of the film.  One never really gets any feeling of deep supernatural evil from the bad guys, so when they do horrible things it just seems like cheap thrills.  Yet the film is not really funny enough to match the standard set by Indiana Jones.  Overall, an enjoyable film, but destined for the dust bin of film history.",7,0,0,18 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Did he really change the story?
","Warning: Spoilers are present, however if you have read down the comments this far, you already know everything about the movie.First, off let me say that I have read the books at least 10 times in my life.  My entire imaginative life has been molded by Tolkein's marvelous world.Second, let me say that I really enjoyed this movie, and I give it a 9 out of 10, same as the first film.  It is not perfect, but it is really good.Now to the meat of my comments.  Many of the commenters, I have noticed have repeatedly bemoaned the changes made in the film.  And there are a fair number of them.  The big question though,as a Tolkein fan, should be 'Did Peter Jackson change the story?'Anyone who has ever seriously considered what it takes to adapt a book into a film has to realize that some things will be different.  Elements that work very well in writing are impossible to translate to the screen. Visual elements take a much more prominent place relative to dialogue and plot. The film must be adapted for the amount of time available (and Jackson is lucky he was allowed 3 hours).  Also, every single person who has read and enjoyed Tolkein's work has a picture in their mind of every character and a movie in their head of every scene.  It is impossible to satisfy all of these diverse viewers with every aspect of the movie.  Someone will be disappointed with something.  Therefore, alterations were inevitable.So, did Jackson change the story?  In my opinion, he didn't.  He did change elements of the story, and on the whole they were changed for the worse.
Some that work well:* cutting out several extra and essentially unnecessary characters and replacing them with other more important characters where necessary (i.e., Erkenbrand replaced with Eomer, in much the same way the Glorfindel was axed to make way for Arwen.) * intercutting the various storylines from the book so that all resolve at the same time. * altering the exact ending and beginning of the film from the book.  As long as Minas Morgul, Shelob, and the breaking of Saruman's staff are in at the beginning of Return of the King, I think the changes Jackson made end up with a better movie. * the whole gunpowder blowing up the wall bit.  I thought is was interesting and exciting. * the cool bit at the black gate with the elf chameleon cloaks. * Gimli as stand up comic.Some that are ambivalent or unnecessary, but don't really make much difference in the end.: * having Elves show up at Helm's Deep.  If he had to bring someone else in, it would have been better if he brought in the Rangers of the North early. * throwing a Warg attack in for fun.  The wargs were the least believable CGI in the film, but you got to see Legolas do that cool quick mount on Gimli's horse, so it was worth it. * More Arwen bits.  Liv Tyler does a passable job, but the storyline really feels tacked on. * Aragorn's whole near death experience.Many that were bad: * Faramir really is a completely different and much less likeable character. * No mention of how Faramir knew that Boromir was dead. * Ditto on Theoden. * No Ent draughts?  How are Pippin and Merry supposed to get tall in Return of the King? * Elrond as manipulative father. * Frodo and Sam dragged off to Osgiliath to be seen by the Nazgul and then set free by Faramir the reformed bully.However, I have to say that all of these items are details.  The fundamentals of the story really remain unchanged.  I hope and believe that many of the bad bits will be corrected in the next film; Faramir will end up cool, Theoden will go down as a true hero, Pippin and Merry will end up big, etc.  But even if they don't, none of these changes ruin it for me.  He got a lot of details wrong, but he also go a lot absolutely right:* Shadowfax running across the heath at Gandalf's whistle. * Gollum/Smeagol, one of the most pathetic, compelling characters I have ever seen in a movie. * Treebeard's eyes and face. * Everything about Eowyn (I get goosebumps picturing her throwing off her helmet before the Lord of the Nazgul, her straw blonde hair blowing in the wind.)As I look at the chapter titles in my copy of the Two Towers, I note that every major story element not already covered in the first film is covered in the second film, up to chapter 8 in Book III and Chapter 6 in Book IV. As long as the remaining chapters are covered well in the next film, then I would say he did well.  And thats really the crux of it all.  If Return of the King doesn't cover some of the important material left out of this movie, and correct a few of the more egregious bad changes, then I might have to revise my rating of this film.  However, hope springs eternal, so the bottom line is that while Jackson made changes, for bad or for worse, I don't think he ever took liberties.One last comment: What is the deal with all the people who read a homoerotic subtext into the movies?  I think that the relationship between Sam and Frodo is one of the best adapted parts of the films.  Look, get it through your heads that these are two hobbits who love each other, in a deep, committed way that has absolutely nothing to do with sex.  It comes through so clearly in both the books and the movie.  I find the whole aspect of friendship in the books and movies to be one of the most compelling aspects. I, for one, find it wonderful to learn about a relationship between two men that doesn't consist of either superficial back-slapping comradery or sex, but of profound friendship.  The friendships between Sam and Frodo, between Merry and Pippin, between Gimli and Legolas; these are the relationships that bring a richness to the work.  A very touching and moving film about homosexual attraction could certainly be made, and probably has been, but this isn't it.Man, I apparently had a lot more to say then I thought.  I wonder if anyone will actually read this.",9,0,0,19 December 2002
La Grande Illusion," An excellent exploration of class and war
","This film is more about the changing relationships between the classes than it is about World War I, during which the film takes place.  From the first scene to the last, Renoir explores the relationships between the various French prisoners of war and their German captors, always showing the great similarities between them.  The dialogue in this film is truly inspired, and the acting of all the main characters is excellent.  Each character is vividly drawn in a few brief moments, and then expanded on in the rest of the film.  I could see how some might be disappointed in this film, if they expected an early version of 'The Great Escape'.  But I was very impressed.",8,1,2,2 June 1999
The Matrix," Astounding style and visuals, with story lagging behind
","I don't know the Wachowski brothers, but I know what movies they watch.  Go see the Matrix and you will too.  Do you like Hong Kong kung fu action pics, such as Iron Monkey or any Jet Li film?  So do the Wachowskis.  They obviously knew who in Hong Kong to hire for their wire work and stunt choreography, because the hand to hand fight scenes in this film are excellent, and led to applause in the preview audience I saw this film with. Do you like John Woo's best Chow Yun Fat films, such as Hardboiled and the Killer?  The Wachowskis do as well.  There is enough flying shell casings, exploding concrete walls, and 2 handed gun play in this film for the most die hard Woo fan.  Do you like Japanese Cyberpunk Anime, such as Ghost in the Shell or Akira?  Those Wachowskis must love it as well.  The storyline in this film seems straight out of Tokyo, and has that same 'I'm not quite sure I understand what is going on, but it sure is neat' quality that much anime has.  The special effects (which are very well done) are designed to generate the feel of anime in a live action film.While the Wachowskis are not quite as good at any of the elements of this film then the true oriental masters are, they have succeeded admirably in synthesizing those elements together into one exciting film.  If you are going to see this one, see it on the biggest screen you can, because on video (unless you have a home theater set up more expensive than the GNP of Belgium) this movie will simply not carry your interest. Without the stunning visuals and style to distract you, some of the plot holes and Keanu Reeves acting (Jah be praised he has to do very little acting) will be much more obvious.",9,0,0,30 March 1999
