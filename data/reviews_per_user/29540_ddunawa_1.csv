Iron Man 3," So bad, that I cried, and now I can't sleep.
","This movie is so bad that I have trouble sleeping at night. I have cold sweat nightmares, where I imagine Shane Black holding down the Iron Man suit and rapping him. I would go on and on with evidence as to why this movie is so bad, but I think the majority of the reviews speak for themselves. Before, anyone bashes me for being pro comic book or a genuine nerd. Let me first say that I have thought that Marvel had done a great job creating movies before this one. I did not have too much of a problem with Iron Man 2. This movie however is awful from start to finish. I hope Marvel can salvage this franchise and quit trying to make comic book movies as 'realistic' as possible. They are comic book movies, they are not suppose to be real. You are writing sci-fi fiction, cut it out with the realism guys. My biggest gripe with the movie and it has been said by just about everybody on this review forum is The Mandarin. We were all fouled into thinking that an iconic super villain would take on a classic super hero. A show down that would set both on a path of awesome CGI destruction. I was unsure of how this would play out but I knew this was the show down we all wanted. The first two movies had less than quality show downs. The Mandarin is the biggest they could do and it's because of his abilities and his goal of ruling over all and destroying Iron Man. Ultimo, Fin Fang Foom, Justin Hammer, Zeke Stane (Obadaih's son) and others would come to his side in order to destroy Iron Man. The leader of SHIELD Tech, Leader inside SHIELD and friend to most all other super heroes. Cutting down Iron Man would hurt War Machine, Pepper Potts, and everybody. This movie gave us nothing. When Happy went into a coma, I have to be honest, I felt nothing. When Stark found the Mandarin's lair, I was like, yes! That quickly switched to yells of pain. I really hope that they can repair this by giving the Mandarin the rings and turning him evil but I feel that would be impossible.",1,5,11,13 May 2013
