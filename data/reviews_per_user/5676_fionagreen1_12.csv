The Avengers," The Avengers Dissassembled
","By now it's probably all been said before, so I'm really just adding weight to the views on both sides of the nerd-gasm that was The Avengers.Entertainment is the name of the game here, and Whedon doesn't hold back for a minute, throwing brawling superheroes, invading aliens, and wide-scale destruction at the screen throughout its running time.Some of the character interplay, particularly between Tony Stark (Iron Man) and Bruce Banner (Hulk) are a joy to watch, with the former's acerbic put-downs (Thor is dubbed 'Point Break', and Captain America is renamed 'Rock of Ages') injecting fun into what could have otherwise been a joyless jaunt between explosions.The acting is credible overall, with Mark Ruffalo perfectly characterising Bruce Banner as the embodiment of all that the Hulk is not (awkward, reserved, quiet), Robert Downey Jnr channelling Stark's usual suave arrogance, and Tom Hiddleson's Loki permeating charm and menace in equal measure (Banner comments 'you can smell crazy on him' at one point).These are all positives I'd been expecting from the man who wowed me with Firefly and Serenity, and my wife with Buffy.Unfortunately, there are quite a few problems as well, even for a comic book fan such as myself.Firstly, there's some seriously lumpen exposition, particularly the juvenile intro scene where the alien 'plan to invade' is bullet-pointed for the audience, in case we can't follow the basic premise. I fully expected a white board and felt markers to be used at any second. The end-credit scene is in a similar vein, and is equally cringe-worthy.A pet-hate of mine (and my wife's) is a lack of logic, and The Avengers excels in this area, with 1. The base explosion near the intro, completely unexplained, just to be accepted, 2. Loki brainwashing/controlling his 'minions' by tapping their hearts (rather than their heads, where their 'minds' are (doh!)) with his staff, and 3. Why there are numerous scenes in which the invading aliens don't open fire at the clearly exposed cops, civilians and heroes they are flying over (are they saving ammo?).Another point to consider is the absence of the National Guard. Were they off on holiday that day? By some margin, though, the greatest gripe I have with The Avengers, is the lack of genuine threat that Loki and his army poses to, not just the Avengers themselves, but to any modern army.While Loki is more than capable of taking care of Captain America (then again, who isn't?), he is quite clearly no match for Hulk, Thor or Iron Man, who each take turns in highlighting this fact. In my experience of superheroes, it's paramount to play the 'heroes' as the underdogs, who must face and overcome a challenge that, at first, seems beyond them. This is what makes for exciting (and unpredictable) entertainment.In The Avengers, there's no point at which we're under any illusion that Loki and his horde will fail, nor is there any need for concern over our heroes, since they are the overwhelming favourites to rise triumphant.All that said, I didn't feel short-changed when I left the cinema, and this is coming from someone who generally avoids Hollowood movies. Maybe some of the more abrasive critics of the movie are right - some of us are just nerdy and want to see characters with incredible powers knock the crap out of each other.Although I can understand where a rating of 8.8 has come from (over-enthusiastic fan-boys fresh from the cinema, typing up their reviews BEFORE changing their trousers), I can't add to it. The Avengers isn't Pan's Labyrinth, or Amelie, and in this context, it can't reach top spot or anywhere near it. If you're giving a movie with this numerous faults a full score, you're clearly in need of watching some genuinely well-crafted movies.It's not clever, but it is BIG!",6,3,11,11 May 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Damn Good Show Old Boy
","On first viewing I was completely underwhelmed by this second outing for the world's greatest detective, although this might've been considerably flavoured by a cinema that would've been more effective as a fridge.A second sitting, though, revealed a well-paced and thoroughly entertaining period romp, channelled, of course, through Guy Ritchie's highly-stylised lens.The roguish, yet gentlemanly bromance between Sherlock and Watson, continues to blossom here, allowing for all manner of shenanigans typical of the period, and to add my voice to others suggesting likewise, both actors seemed born to play the parts of these characters.The rest of the cast perform admirably, although naturally playing second fiddle to our two detectives, with Stephen Fry joining in the hi-jinx as Sherlock's brother.Noomi Rapace is largely wasted as a Gypsy plot-adhesive, yet continues to make a name for herself, regardless.The story itself is one of diabolical ambition typically reserved for a Bond movie, with Moriarty, Sherlock's adversary wonderfully pinning down the archetypal villain in just the right measure of charm and menace.The music is flawless, the scenes exciting, and the possibility of a further adventure is on the cards. All in all, it's pretty hard not to enjoy.My only real criticism is a lack of moral understanding from Guy Ritchie, highlighted in two separate, but related conversations. In the first we hear Holmes analysing Moriarty's handwriting, which he claims suggests a lack of empathy bordering on moral insanity, yet within half an hour we hear Holmes criticise Moriarty for indulging in a hobby of feeding pigeon's which he dubs '...winged vermin'. Surely even the most ignorant of moralists understands that it takes far more empathy for a person to relate to a bird than it does to another human. This actually shows Moriarty to have, either greater empathy than Holmes, or simply a lack of empathy regarding people.That very minor detail aside, though, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although that may have also been coloured by the fine bottle of red, and the roll of green, I enjoyed whilst watching it.Here's to the return of our fearless duo.",7,0,0,24 May 2012
Skyfall," Bond-Fall
","What a crushing bore of a movie.There's nothing even remotely original or progressive about this outing for Bond, and for me it actually plumbed new depths of disappointment that even Quantum of Solace hadn't reached.It's the same-old, same-old, with the obligatory car-chase opening which, unlike the superb Casino Royale, attempts nothing innovative, such as parquet or scaffold-scaling.The plot is a by-the-numbers yawn-a-thon along the lines of a rogue former agent, which sounds very familiar if you've seen Goldeneye.There are even obvious mistakes, which, due to boredom in the cinema, I picked up on. They both involve characters (M, then Bond) failing to pick up objects that they miraculously have in hand seconds later despite leaving them where they lay. This is unforgivable for movies with huge budgets.I despair for Bond, for although Casino Royale injected some much needed excitement and depth to the series (good plot, interesting characters, emotional resonance), the two movies since have trundled on as if it had never happened.In fact, so much of the movie is spent referencing the old ones, that there is a desire to dig out the originals, which surely can't have aged that badly, could they? If you don't expect anything new or interesting, you might not be disappointed.",1,18,37,4 December 2012
Inglourious Basterds," It's good and bad in almost equal measure
","So you know what it's about. Here's a review you can read in about the same time it takes to play a game of who's who.Firstly there are some wonderfully iconic scenes, such as the 'basement stand-off', and one highly effective performance in Waltz's Nazi detective, Hans Landa, which give Inglorius a rewatchability.Praise must also be encouraged for the direction of languages, which lend the movie priceless creditability, along with a great deal of its appeal.Sadly, as has been mentioned elsewhere at length, Mike Myers' cameo is without purpose and merely distracting, as is Brad Pitt's redneck accent.Perhaps the biggest flaw of the movie, though, is Tarintino's continued obsession with segmenting movies unnecessarily, along with adding titles, and back stories related by voice-overs. These disrupt, not just the flow of the movie (any movie), but also the 'feel' of it. For example, all the cat and mouse tension and emotional intensity of the intro, is undone at the moment when Quinten reaches for the titles board.The ending was a little flat for me also, and somehow unsatisfying. This typifies the mood of the film, which wavers uncertainly between being a serious war movie and a knowing pantomime.You finished that game yet?",4,5,9,30 December 2009
Ted," Ted's Dead
","Possibly the least funny 'comedy' I've ever had to sit through, which was a shock for me, since the creators of Family Guy, a show I love, were involved.I think this entire movie falls on its own rump if the novelty of a swearing, weed-smoking teddy bear wears off at any point. For me it took about five minutes.After that it was just a slew of simple, crude 'jokes' that never hit their mark due to their reliance on the teddy-bear vehicle.The bear itself was an irritating character, completely unlikable in every regard, and what was up with Mark Wahlbergs' accent? Are there really Americans with dialects as ridiculous as that? It sounded like he was chewing words rather than saying them.All in all, juvenile, and not even funny with it.",1,6,12,6 December 2012
Man of Steel," Supercrap
","There are plenty of reviews which highlight the countless inconsistencies of this movie (the director should be made to watch it), so I won't mirror these.What bothered me far more were the numerous religious/theistic tones and symbolism throughout the movie, highlighting the entire wreck as nothing more than a vehicle for some Christianity-selling.I'm, of course, talking about the title character's baffling, needless Jesus Christ pose in Earth's orbit, the female 'baddie's' childish, claim that 'Evolution always wins' (that why the majority of humans are God-fearing despite no sensible reason, facts shunned in favour of here-say), and Superman's Earth-father telling him that he was 'sent to Earth for a reason', that old, egotistical attitude that encourages people to believe that the vast entirety of the universe operates solely to benefit the youngest, most destructive species on a tiny planet in a quiet corner of one galaxy among billions.And people told me that the movie was 'Awesome'?! Why? What exactly does it do that's original/inventive/creative/unique? It's simply another cleverly marketed money-machine to keep hollowood rich, and YOU, the people, allowed it.Absolutely ridiculous, and an insult to my intelligence.That said, the effects were pretty good it places.Please, though, people, let's not settle for this kind of mindless nonsense. You need to want more from your movies if you want to see better ones.",1,32,61,14 August 2013
The Thing," Still squirm-inducing 29 years on
","Isolation. Paranoia. Fear.These are the typical key words used to describe John Carpenter's sci-fi fright-fest 'The Thing'.The standard plot synopsis normally reads; Antartic research team terrorised by shape-shifting alien.What's not so easy to convey is the sense of unease that permeates throughout the movie, from the opening scenes of arctic desolation and that menacing bass-thrum, to the unsettling and downbeat ending.This is genuine, stomach-curdling sci-fi-horror, which effectively translates an ever-escalating sense of fear for the characters amidst the claustrophobic settings of the research base.Little needs to be said of the well-documented special effects, which may still be considered a bar for non-CGI creation, and where acting and pacing are concerned, not a foot is wrongly placed.It's not without some consideration that I award this film a top score, for even today, having watched it recently, I'm still gripped by the taut atmosphere that veins the whole movie.I can think of no other film that inspires such a sense of foreboding or menace, and very few that deliver on such sudden bursts of visceral bloodshed and outright horror.A true classic for anyone with an interest in being scared.",10,1,2,9 December 2011
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim Vs My Attention Span
","Let's cut to the chase. This movie is woefully bad in almost every single aspect. The characters are vague, irritating, two-dimensional non-entities, and as such, I found it impossible to relate to any of them. In particular, Scott Pilgrim is a dull, whiny brat with no personality whatsoever. The rest of the ensemble are cardboard cut-outs aimed at an audience that must surely prize pre-teen rambling over actual conversation, and you'll be hard pushed to remember anything interesting that any one of them said after the movie.The plot is insulting - boy must beat girl's evil ex's to win her. That's it. Wow! The battle scenes are ridiculous, with enemies reduced to coins after being defeated, one of many, many repetitive nods in the direction of out-dated games consoles such as Nintendo's.Seriously this has all been done before and with more style. I cannot believe that this pile of equine manure is the product of the same man that wrote Hot Fuzz.I'll make it plain for you - Do you have ADHD? Are you impressed by flashing lights? Do you want dumb American teens mumbling incoherent nonsense as main characters? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, I give you Scott Pilgrim Vs The World.enjoy.",1,77,177,8 December 2010
Clash of the Titans," 1981 versus 2010 - A de-evolution in movie-making
","By remaking The Clash Of The Titans the director, actors/actresses and all those involved are opening up opportunity for comparison to the original. There's no denying that, so that's the angle I view it from.The Original is dated now, in so far as the effects department is concerned, which is hardly surprising given year of release. That aside though, the nineteen eighty one version is a classic, memorable slice of mythological nostalgia, something the remake will not be in twenty nine years time.For me its flaws are many, but the most notable are the scene choices of the director and the lazy reliance on CGI.Where are the elements that made the original story so compelling? The riddles of Calibos, delivered to the dreaming Andromeda, Perseus falling in love with her (the REASON for his quest in the first instance), the politics of the gods and their chess-piece-like manipulation of the mortals who worship them.Instead we have an inaccurate tale, rushed through in small, stuttering scenes, and lacking in any creativity of its own.The actors/actresses assembled make a fine cast-reading, but are universally wasted in their chosen roles. None of the gravitas of the original is conveyed by any character in this version.The CGI further reduces the movie's impact. The mythological beasts look cartoonish, and hardly befitting an epic tale of such importance. Look to the original yet again to see how, even stop-motion triumphs over CGI. In particular the scene in Medusa's lair is tense in the nineteen eighty one showing, contrasting greatly with the routine, ridiculous remake.That's not to say that CGI cannot work. Jurrasic Park is a rare example of effects being used well.Sam Worthington, quickly becoming a name to avoid movies by, has a character arc that is almost non-existent, such is the hurry to transform him from fisherman to warrior. Notice the fact also that he requires no training to wield a sword skillfully! All things considered, the original will remain a classic for some time, despite the ropey effects, while the remake will be quickly forgotten by a fickle audience looking for the next CGI bonanza.Just as Avatar before it, Clash Of The Titans 2010 is a simple money-making machine, not concerned for a moment with anything close to an imagination or REAL characters. Or for that matter, with any heart.It will gross vast sums of money nonetheless, which further proves that the public don't really want creative or intelligent movies (Moon, Pans Labyrinth, Amelie) but are content to settle for 'plastic' and patronising movies that dis-encourage thinking.",1,165,291,3 April 2010
Avatar," Eat your popcorn and stop thinking!
","This is another of those films that separate the 'entertainment' seekers from the movie fans.Although I must admit to having enjoyed Avatar, in places, the simple, inescapable truth is that are too many ridiculous elements at play in the film for it to be taken seriously. It may take you an hour, a day, a week or even a month to realise this, but hopefully you'll come to this conclusion at some point.Here are the facts: Americans (why is it always Americans? There are still humans on Earth from other countries aren't there?) invade alien world with an uninspiring name (Pandora - where have we heard that name before?) which is populated by creatures who, remarkably, have evolved to look almost completely humanoid. What a lack of imagination! Even the wildlife are simple alterations on what we have on Earth, or from popular mythology.All the characters are one dimensional, and fall neatly into 'goodies' and 'badies' camps immediately. There are no shades of grey in this world - that would be too complicated for the popcorn-munchers.The plot is predictable, which is such a crime to the progression of movies, but is even more so here, considering the way this movie was being touted. The next step in cinema? You mean, computer game graphics, and no story? I think we've already had that, James.Yes, it is rousing, at times, and there are occasionally good ideas, such as the physical connection between native and animals, but they are swamped in 'by the numbers' colouring-in sets and scenes that should only appeal to kids and those who seek only bright lights and loud noises.The story itself is just a riffing on the native Americans' treatment at the hands of the invading white men, which has been mirrored more effectively elsewhere. It's also depressing to see the natives win on Pandora, simply to remind ourselves that this is just a movie, and that it was the invaders who won back in the world of reality.One of the sourest points for me, though, is the fact that the movie was driven by vast sums of money and a hyped marketing strategy - surely two elements that do not sit well with the morality of the tale, or the native people out to stop a huge, greedy corporate organisation.There's more to be said, but I've got a feeling it's been well documented now.I, too, fell for the hype, so on that front the movie is a huge success.",2,9,25,27 December 2009
Prometheus," Alienating
","In an effort to avoid disappointment (being a fan of the Alien mythology), I took my seat in the cinema with as open a mind as possible, expecting nothing at all.Even the day after the late-night viewing, I'm still unsure of exactly how I feel about Prometheus, a very unique position for me regarding movies.Perhaps the equal amount of positives and negatives I've taken from the film have left me in a state of shoulder-shrugging, a view seemingly at odds with the majority of polar opinions on IMDb.As has been stated almost universally, the visuals and effects are of the high-tier calibre expected from the director who wowed audiences with Alien and Bladerunner (vastly overrated in my humble opinion).I also concede that the plot was very loosely threaded and subject to random offshoots which ended without resolution, and themes that were vague and unexplored.The pandering to religious audiences in having the two main scientists carrying crosses (Holloways tattoo is the other one) is insulting to science, a medium where factual answers are sought, in opposition to the hallelujah corner, who blindly buy into words on a book, written by goat-herders who believed that sneezing released demons.I find it incredible that in this era of knowledge, people still ask such self-centred, obliviously naive questions such as 'why are we here'? Surely an understanding of DNA reveals the answer, despite this answer being so stark and brutal that billions of humans would rather invent self-pleasing fairy tales to avoid the truth.We're here because our DNA constructed us, and our purpose is to survive, selfishly, at all costs. End of story.Even though Rapace's character finds, not god, but alien creators (viable, since DNA is involved), she still searches blindly for something there is (God), not just a complete absence of evidence for, but also absolutely no rational inclination to believe in. How ignorant.Anyway, I digress.The acting was as expected for a movie carrying a handful of well-known faces, surrounded by mere cannon-fodder, with Fassbender's android providing much of the magnetism, despite some all-too human emotions and some strange behavioural decisions, such as the drink-droplet.What I found utterly unconvincing was the blasé reaction from the other characters to the multiple deaths occurring around them, along with some of the inexplicable decisions a few of them made.Spoilers: The awakened Space Jokey/Engineer's reaction to his discoverers was also a little 'unexpected' to say the least, but then if we're correct in believing that they're out to end our evolution, it may be unsurprising.So many questions, so few answers. Was the initial Engineer who 'sparked' life on Earth acting in accordance with his species, or as an individual? Why did these beings stop visiting us? Are the Engineers' set on destroying us due to our parasitic and destructive nature? Why did Scott bother with the hastily, unexplored element of mortality, introduced by such a pointless character as the old man? Where did the chest-busters that killed the Engineers vanish to? Where was the intermittent reading of life coming from? Where was the Engineer who was discovered at the seat of the ship in Alien? Why is Rapace's character searching, when we all know that the faithful (so named for a reason) are content NOT to search, but to simply ACCEPT? As my wife has commented, this movie has more holes in it than swiss cheese.That said, there were occasional scenes that were impressive, including the Med-lab abortion, but for such moments, there were a dozen unexplained ones, such as the paranoid Fifield seeking his own way back to the ship, highly unlikely behaviour for someone who is clearly spooked, or his bizarre return as a crazed zombie, induced by the oily substance.So, in a nutshell, it was slightly confusing, with some juvenile attempts at philosophical depth, and a smattering of unlikely behavioural patterns, despite a fairly grand visual feast.Back to the drawing board Ridley. And please don't follow this one up with an even more religious offering, for in this age the shadows in which a traditional God can survive are shrinking, and rightly so. Actual knowledge is far more rewarding than personal desires and fantasies.A decent effort at a sci-fi epic, but it joins the ranks as an unfitting addition to the Alien mythos.",5,8,24,1 June 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Meh
","What's all the fuss about with these new incarnations of Batman? The first one was instantly forgettable, the second only sparked when the Joker was on-screen, and the third is a confusing, overlong waste of time, save for the wonderful and super-sexy Catwoman. Grrrrr.After a messy, incoherent opening sequence during which neither myself or my wife had any idea of what was going on, we then found ourselves wondering at numerous points in the movie exactly when it would finish.A major flaw of the film is the music, which is so loud the characters are constantly shouting to be heard over it. I missed so much dialogue I gave up trying to follow the 'plot'.It's also a bleak, dull, depressing affair which doesn't encourage the viewer to endure repeat screenings.On the plus side, I loved Anne Hathaway's Catwoman, a sleek, sexy feline who stole the entire show for me, just as the Joker did in the previous outing.Apart from her, though, there's nothing to get even remotely excited about here, unless you're impressed when comic books are filmed in dark colours and there's much frowning and glowering, etc.I think that's what accounts for the vast appeal of this trilogy - the fact that comics aren't supposed to be adult in theme or presentation, yet here they are.I'm afraid, there needs to be more for me than a grown-up version of Batman.POW!",3,4,9,5 December 2012
