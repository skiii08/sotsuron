The Blair Witch Project," Plain as drywall
","Really don't get the hype with this film, I really don't. There's simply nothing great about it yet it's extremely overrated! To start, the biggest & main issue is... NOTHING & I mean NOTHING happens in this film! You don't see anything aside from 3 teens screaming, shouting & swearing at one another throughout the 85 minutes of this film! There's no entity you can actually SEE, because apparently of this film was to have an 'unseen' entity or 'force' tormenting the 3 teens! I understand the scary idea of something you can't see or touch must be scary in real life, to just imagine it alone is scary but for it to be translated into a film for an audience behind a camera is boring! I want to SEE something not IMAGINE where's the use in that when you can easily say that ghosts don't exist? Hell you'd be better off watching an episode of Most Haunted with Yvette Fielding screaming & shouting at everything while here team also swear & curse at nothing it's that boring! That's this film in a nutshell!Film's are meant to be entertaining & the idea for this film fails to attempt to have an unseen force chasing them, we don't see anything so what on earth is the point? I just simply don't get how that can be scary considering your watching this in the comfort of your own home/cinema! It just doesn't work unless it were a real life situation! Where then it WOULD be scary & worth bragging about on the net! This film doesn't cut it & is watered down enough as it is with the shaking cam, annoying dialogue, weak story line, thin plot, Jesus need I go on!?The ending well... was crap, funnily enough better then the 85 minutes that was wasted! It was at this point, too little too late & only a 1 second bit of SOMETHING happening in the entire film! Just bad! REALLY bad!A sequel titled Book of Shadows was released in 2000 a year later & by Christ is way way WAY better than this weak piece of trash! 1/10, ignore this film & watch Book of Shadows that has action, blood, gore & something ACTUALLY happening unlike this pathetic excuse of a film!",1,3,6,15 August 2016
Insidious: Chapter 2," Scary as F**K!
","Went to see this on the day it came out! On Friday 13th!& by Christ this was this sequel bone chilling!! It beats the first by miles in terms of jump scares! Very dramatic scenes, jump scares & the scoring raising the intensity level right up!!The film itself was dark suspenseful & extremely intense! Gave me chills & spills I must say! The score was just perfect! The scenes were dramatic & sh*t scary! Like when the old man suddenly grabs Josh & scares him! When the lady appears & screams in you face! Just perfect! Along with the whole cinema (which was jam pact let me tell you!!!) applauding & wolf whistling in the cinema at overpowering points of the film! It was just a great atmosphere! They screamed & roared at the top of their voices in the cinema when the intense jump scares took place! Epic!!! Their was couples around me, with the girls cuddling up to their boyfriends! Hah!You must watch this film! If you've seen the first Insidious! Then see this epic sequel! It's epic!10/10 Looking forward to seeing Insidious 3 which leave a wide gap for a sequel!",10,1,3,13 September 2013
Blade Runner 2049," Too Long, Too Loud, Too Dull, Too Boring & Too Confusing!!
","Heard vaguely about the first Blade Runner but heard it was a book series, but again it's not something I particularly cared enough to latch onto. I just heard the words Blade Runner but didn't know exactly that it was a film, nor did I know it's story-line, theme, or that it was a book series before hand, let alone when it was released! This film, Blade Runner 2049, takes place 30 years since the last, though the film itself is made 35 bloody damn years after the 1982 original! That's way, way way way too long to make a sequel, the excuses are simply not good enough, this could've been a damn remake, that's how long ago it was made!Anyway, having heard about this film coming up & from a friend of mine, I decided to give this a watch, though I noticed that this was 163 minutes long, but I was willing to give it a watch despite also not being a Sci-Fi fan!I found the film to be stupidly, stupidly long! Way too loud & I'm on 23 not 80! It was confusing I didn't have a clue what was going on from the get go! The film dragged & dragged some more & it got duller & duller, by the time it got to the 1 hour mark I was already beginning to get restless & bored. The film just simply plodded on for too long & it was 1 hour too long than it needed to be! It could've been 90 minutes short, but pointless scenes dragging on unnecessarily & other pointless dragged out parts had to be in there! It slowed down the pacing to well below the 1 mph mark! The sound was extremely loud, too loud even for someone like myself whose used to watching loud action films with gunfire sounds booming explosions! But this film was badly edited though length & sound mix it was just bad! The story-line was confusing & made no sense, the length & pacing didn't help with this as you forgot what was what at the beginning! Not to mention the middle to which even then the film felt stretched & like it was never going to end! It went on & on & on & on & on...! If you know what I mean, it was slower than a damn tortoise! How many times do I have to emphasis to these idiots who make these films? Cut! The! Shite! OK!? Less is more! Short & Sweet! You get me!? This film could've been over & hour short! 1 hour & 10-20 minutes of fine tune super cut editing should've done it & of course made the film better, that & to beef the story-line up & make it more simpler to understand for those who weren't even born when the first Blade Runner was released! Cutting the shite & trimming the fat! That's how they should've edited this film! But no!They have to make it long & dragged out! So sense mental! By the time it got to the end, you were just glad to get out of there! You didn't care for the end result because you too bored to even care, you only cared that it ended in the first place let alone the content of the ending which just like the pacing & story-line, was proper arse!The reviewers are clearly paid, once again, to write great 10/10 reviews! Because any old tosser who gets £20 million flung onto their lap would take money like morons right!? Gullible tossers! I guess Money does really talk & well Bullshite does actually walk! I'm not paid to write this review, I'm writing this from my true & honest opinion! I ain't a liar or a faker! This is my honest review about this film & take it from me, it was utter crap! 1/10",1,10,21,10 October 2017
Iron Man 3," Great Film!
","Liked this one! Shame it's the last one! But good franchises have to end somewhere!The film itself was good, even if I myself, am not into Marvel films such as, Avengers Assemble & Thor! The villain/villains powers were ace! The special effects were epic, over 2000 visual effects were used supposingly! Iron Mans transformations & suit designs were good! The bit I liked was with the piece by piece clinging onto Tony! The humour was great here & there as per with the other instalments! Tony Stark's swift talking & punch lines are sarcastically funny! The bit I also liked was when he threaten the villain while the guy was filming him with his phone & Tony grabbed it afterwards & threw it at a brick wall! Then said 'Sue me!' Priceless!The destruction scene like Tony's house getting blown up was great! Explosions & mass destruction! Just like the finale which was great! Especially for the 3D effects!But other than that it was a great film! 9/10",9,3,15,27 April 2013
Deepwater Horizon," Decent
","Saw trailers & previews for this film & made plans to go see it as soon as.The film is about an Oil Rig named Deepwater Horizon which suffered a catastrophic explosion on the 20th April, 2010. The film is based off of the real life events of those involved in the disaster over 6 years ago & the 11 who were killed. I found the film to be decent, not the greatest. I never knew about the disaster until the film & even then never knew it was based off of true events. But it was a decent watch.I found the film took a while to get going & dragged with too much dialogue until it got to the action pack explosion parts. This seemed to carry on in certain areas of the film til the end. I also felt some scenes alone dragged on a bit too long, it could have done with a trim in a lot of areas being honest. Get to the point is what I say!The explosions & action parts were pretty good & spectacular. I did like the survival theme going on & the fire/explosion effects used. Though though all that, I found myself getting a bit lost at points in what was going on & what was happening & basically who was who. It was a bit confusing in areas through the explosions & fire. The film's rating to a 12 was a turn off also. If they wanted to truly capture the dramatic effect of the horror & disastrous chaos that took place & unfolded that day, then why not kick the film up to a 15 rating? I found some parts of this film, the injuries to be too subtle & toned down which I found to be restrained. I'm not saying it has to be Saw gory, I'm saying that it could be beefed up a bit more.I overall found this to be a great film, it was a watchable film based off the events of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. 7/10",7,0,1,1 October 2016
It," Better than the Original!
","Now before I start, I know the Original wasn't a Film, but a 2 Parter TV Series. But that don't mean this vision doesn't replicate & remake the original vision. Just wanted to clarify that.Now I caught a screening of this at my local & was blown away by how epic IT was! See what I did there...! Anyway, it was dark, gory, bloody & extremely creepy & sinister! The Pennywise in this vision is far more creepy & sinister looking than in the original, not to mention with the amount of clown scares going about over the past couple of years in the UK, this really added to that fear & phobia, not to mention how it connects with a new generation on what we find scary & sinister! It's also perfect timing too!The story in this vision is from the kids POV, so that mean in maybe 2019/2020, we'll see Part 2 with from the adults POV! It'll be great as I'm looking forward to it!The film unleashed a lot more & was simply more extreme in terms of fear factor! The gore was a lot more intense & realistic! So much so I'm surprised this wasn't an 18 certificate, as this film was rated a 15!As I said before, Pennywise was a lot more creepier in this vision that he was in the 1990 vision, as he looked too cartoon like & simply not scary enough! I also felt the dialogue was more real to life in this too!Only thing I would say I disliked about this film was the run time, I felt the film dragged towards the end & was a bit too long, but I suppose considering the book (which I've never read) it's pretty short in comparison! Overall, I say this was epic & great film, aside from the run time, it was a truly epic remake, with a dark, sinister & very gory twist on it!9/10",9,7,16,8 September 2017
Hereditary," Well...
","Seen this a month ago but never really got around to reviewing until now.To put it simply, it was ok & no more.I mean it was pretty good, sinister, creepy & plain screwed up. But on the other hand it was slow, boring, depressing & weird! It was 50/50, in short.I liked the film & its creepy elements, but I also felt the film could've been at least 40 minutes shorter & cut the crap in a lot of areas, which I get (in a way) were for dramatic purposes, but still, dragging scenes out (longer than what they should be) to the extent to which it starts to bore the audience, (& it feels like running through quicksand) means there is something wrong with the films pacing & editing (techniques)!But the film was nonetheless sinister & purely epic in terms of it's content! Sadly it was let down by it's overly long run time, pacing & editing! 5/10 That's fair!",5,0,1,19 July 2018
Rocketman," Better than Bohemian Rhapsody
","Seen this tonight & must say it was actually pretty good!The film tells the story of Elton John from when he was a child throughout to his adult life. It tells of the struggles & highs & lows he went through!The film was pretty decent! It enticed me in & kept me interested throughout!The only downside was the musical set up, I mean it wasn't really bad, but it let the film down a little!The films overall depiction was most realistic & more faithful than that of 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody which twisted & bent certain events. Bits were added on, parts were either over exaggerated or fictional & the film was sugar coated & made out to be sunshine & rainbows!Overall the film is good! The acting is spot on & the preferences were strong as ever! 8/10",8,2,8,26 May 2019
A Star Is Born," Pretty Good.
","Seen this when originally wanting to see Bad Times at the El Royale, but seen this instead. To say the least, it was pretty good! Not amazing, but really good & better than average!The film is about a musician named Jack who helps a young (babe) of a singer named Ally rise to fame as the music industry (being the way it is ) won't sing her on because of her 'nose', supposingly. And so Jack, gives her that boost she needs until a record company recognises her & signs her on. The boos is named Rez who although really likes the artistic talents of Ally dislikes the drunken, druggy attitude of her now hubby & then boyfriend, Jack. The second half of the film deals with the struggles of being a recording artist while touring & producing singles & albums!I found the film to be quite interesting. It really got you & dragged you till the end. Though long, it still done well in telling the story of Ally trying to get recognition. As well as the story of Jack, an older musician with a drink & drug problem dealing with his wife getting fame in an instant while he's getting slammed.The film was overall pretty good, sad & unexpected at the end but it was a good watch! 7/10 is what the film deserves it was above average at best!",7,2,4,25 October 2018
Us," Decent, but not amazing!
","Didn't expect too much from this film when I seen the previews. But went to see it anyway given that I'm a horror buff.The film is about a family who come across the 'doubles' one night after a holiday away at a cabin by the lake. The 'dopplegangers' are intent on killing the members of the family in sadistic games. That's what the trailer & synopsis says, but the rest of the film (the slashing & twists) are pretty much hidden from the audience, enticing them in as it were...Though I must say from watching the film I was pleasantly surprised. From the previews I took this film to be more psychological, but the film has quite a lot of slasher infused moments in it. Which is great as I love slashers.The core of the film was pretty great, but sadly the ending climax quickly looses momentum and starts to drag. Furthermore, the film turns strange and begins to loose its novelty pretty fast. Then the twist comes along with a backstory which is alright, but a bit dumb and over the top. The end twists especially was contradictory & pretty plot hole like. It felt added in to have an uncertain ending or a so called clever ending. But unfortunately, despite a good start & a strong middle, the climax leave lots to be desired and finishes pretty weak anti climatic ending.Critics & cinema snobs have hyped this up once again like they do with lots of mediocre horrors and boring films of today designed to be 'unique' & not cliche. But this one was borderline decent, not quite amazing.Overall, worth a watch, but the ending will leave you confused and left with more questions than answers. 6/10",6,0,1,26 March 2019
Knives Out," A Well Executed Crime Thriller
","Seen a trailer for this back in the summer & couldn't wait to see it.After watching I have to say the film was really well done! The story was enticing & the twists were good! I loved the whodunit theme in this & the clever story telling also!Daniel Craig especially done well among the other actors in this film. It's the second time he plays an american with a southern accent!The film centers on a Cluedo like murder which has taken place among a family in a large house. But all is not what it seems with the death & with the detective on board, shocking revelations surrounding the mysterious death come to lightThough the film did take a while to get going & was a bit hard to understand at first, the film was ace once it did get going!Overall a great watch! 8/10",8,4,10,30 November 2019
Blade," Very Good!
","Not a fan of vampire horror flicks but gave this one a watch from seeing the trailer.The film is about a man named Blade, who was born a vampire after his mum got bitten while conceiving him.I found the film to be pretty epic & entertaining! Wesley Snipes does the role of Blade well as with the other actors themselves of the roles given! The gore effects were ace, however the CGI effects were fake looking & unrealistic looking, but I guess for a film of 1998, it was good...!Overall, worth a watch! 8/10",8,0,0,4 June 2019
Creed," Great Film!
","I heard there was going to be a Rocky 7 film coming out, though I knew the possibility of him fighting would be out right impossible considering the age of Sly himself! But there was word of a another Rocky film, which was thought to be titled 'Rocky 7' was titled Creed though a UK release date was yet to be set until I found out it was to be release in January. I got to see this as a preview at my local cinema. It was pretty good!The film is about Adonis Creed, a young man who wants to be a boxer just like his dad, Apollo Creed. He then begins to take an interest in fighting & gets the help of the legendary, Rocky Balboa to train him! The film was pretty good! I did like how there was references to the previous films, along with verbal revelations about the past. Though I thought this was a good film, I felt the other Rocky films were better, though this was a great spin off & I like how we got to see the son of Apollo fighting in the ring! It was overall a great film & a good addition to the Rocky series! 8/10",8,1,5,12 January 2016
Aquaman," Solid Marvel Film!
","Seen this tonight & must say I was impressed!The story-line is pretty decent, the effects are epic & dazzling!The characters were pretty good & the action is pretty solid!But my complaint for this film is that it suffers from the Dragging-On-Itis, which kind of let it down as it could've been snappier & more rapid in both action & story telling!But overall the film was pretty good & solid for what it was! Roll on Auqaman 2!8/10",8,2,9,18 December 2018
Deadpool 2," That's just lazy writing!
","Finally got round to watching this film after much talk since the original!So without spoiling too much I must say this sequel was all I hoped it would be... ACE!!The twisted humour, the action, the jokes all done to perfection!There's a few sad moments in this film also but definitely outweighed by the happy ones also!The characters are awesome & the story-line is good!Overall, just as epic as the first Deadpool! 9/10 Roll on Deadpool 3!",9,3,6,19 May 2018
The Hateful Eight," The perfect Tonic I needed!
","Have to say, I'm not a fan of these 'dirty harry' 'western style' films let alone, a fan of QT. Though I hear his works are what I live to watch & expect in cinema, not really, or should I say, was a fan. But after seeing this I'd have to say I like his work!I saw this in January this year with a friend of mine & we both loved it after it finished! It was long, but very entertaining & funny, not to mention VERY gory! Which I f**king loved! The soundtrack I also loved too, especially the opening sequence with the Jesus statue, that was just something else!The twist was great too & the classic fonts & western style chapters for each segment was a nice touch! I liked the dialogue & the actors who played in the film, Samuel L. Jackson nails the role!The films graphics were good too & the whodunit theme was great along with the humour & racial slurs which gave this film an edge!I give this a 10/10 it was truly epic & whats more it was an 18 film!! It was the perfect tonic I needed since the last 18 rated film I saw!",10,1,3,1 October 2016
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Umm...
","So after only 2 Amazing Spidermans in both 2012 & 2014 respectively, we get yet another remake of this hero (this time with a change... or more...!), which since the 2 previous remakes, has been ruined even further with, political correctness, drastic changes & worse than before plot with muddied elements of every caliber!Now to start, I didn't find this film as bad as I thought, though my criticisms & issues were met after viewing which still explains why I'm giving this film a low rating, not a 'hated it' rating.The film is about Peter Parker who is spider man, basically, though this film is far different from what you expect from the previous film & films of course of both Marvel & in general of the same starting point (not to mention in books & comics), especially the Tobey Maguire original. In this film, Peter is already Spiderman & in the previous Avengers film was seen briefly, thereby this film here coming to light. But there's a different story-line & of course Tony Stark is in it, which to me muddies the waters quite a bit as it isn't a stand alone Spiderman film, but an Avengers film slash Spiderman Film. It really has reached the limit & will do if & when the sequel gets made!The character of spiderman is socially awkward & to be fair a tiny bit annoying. Not to mention the jokes, the run time, the traits of spiderman which have gone right out the window & of course the political correctness, all of the above have diluted a once great franchise! Spiderman not shooting webs 'directly' from his wrists annoyed me in the Amazing Spiderman Films, but even more so here! Anyone & I mean, 'anyone' could or can be spiderman, whats the point in making Iron Man like gadgets if Spiderman has powers? It makes no sense, not to mention the overkill in humour in which it was really overused & made the tone a little too light hearted & well just stupid!The political correctness with the characters was annoying, MJ & Liz, don't even get me started...! Story-line... nothing special & pretty tame, no life saving, keeping the jokes at bay until needed, too gimmicky & hard to take serious & well just dumb in a lot of places!The plot holes too, pfft! But...! On the other hand, the villain was cool, some great visuals & a few little laughs here & there & I mean little & few & far between! But sadly, the film just didn't cut it for me! It seems now films like this can't be simple & straight to the point, they have to be riddled with plot holes, bad/complex/annoying/dragged out story-line, annoying characters, politically correct characters, damn I could go on!4/10 Watch the Originals of Tobey Maguire! They're the best & always will be better!",4,11,20,11 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Pretty ace film!
","Having only seen Fast & Furious 4 & 5! This was pretty epic! The story was pretty decent! Not amazing, but pretty good in it's own respect! Also how it took place in London was pretty ace! Liked the rapid shots of the chases that took place! The fighting scenes were epic! Especially the ones that took place in the London underground! Really got me on the edge of my seat! Lacked racing abit but wasn't too bad! The ending was just epic! With the car chase in Spain with the army tank! Epic! Along with the epic finale ending with them taking down the giant air plane, along with fights taking place in the air plane!! Then the plane blowing up into flames! Just awesome! Overall a decent film! With great action sequences in it! 9/10",9,5,7,21 May 2013
Scary Movie 2," A Decent sequel!
","I'd say that this one was a pretty good follow up! Despite it having a weak story which didn't make much sense but still had it's laughs & Gags!David Cross was funny in this one with him in the wheel chair! Like when Dwight & Hanson make jokes to one another Hanson making Wheel Chair jokes to Dwight & Dwight making hand jokes Hanson! The returning cast were pretty good as the first! With Cindy, Shorty & Ray! The part when Cindy was singing in the car & the sing on the radio asked her to shut the F**k up was funny! Along with the table scene with the My Germs with Hanson contaminating the food! The giant weed plant rolling shorty up into a weed cigarette! Not to mention Dwight sucking his own ****! Funny as!Overall a decent sequel to a **** take film!",8,0,1,11 April 2013
Final Destination 2," An Ace Sequel!
","Seeing this was pretty good! It was very well put together!The opening was good explaining the events from the first film! The motorway disaster was epic! The Explosions, the Gore & the Destruction was top notch!The deaths were pretty good! Evans Death especially! How everything went together perfectly! The omens were good too! The Ladder impaling his eye was just well done!The other deaths were good like Tim Death with the dentist chair & the glass pane crushing him! But the deaths suffered the whole Buildup suspense pattern! They were like the first one too quick & over in seconds! But they were good! How they referred to how the cheated death the first time & how in the first film they caused a rift in deaths design & if not one of them (The cast from the first Final Destination) had died, then they wouldn't have lived as their deaths had an effect on theirs lives too! Just clever!A pretty good sequel! 9/10",9,2,2,11 January 2013
Blade II," Solid Sequel
","With the hit 1998 film comes Blade II! Wesley Snipes once again returns as Blade!In the first Blade, he fought against Vampires. But in this sequel, he fights WITH them against a group of reapers!I found this sequel to be pretty good! Just as good as the first & not much better or worse.The action and fight scenes are great and the blood and gore effects never fail to disappoint!Overall a solid sequel! 8/10",8,0,0,6 June 2019
Suicide Squad," *Beeping* Epic!!
","Just got back from a midnight screening of this film & have to say it's probably the best 15 rated DC film I've seen since Deadpool 6 months earlier! If anything, this takes the crown! This being 1st, Deadpool 2nd & Kick Ass 3rd!So the film is about 6 eccentrically epic villains who have been imprisoned for their crimes & get a new lease on life to save the city from an evil spirit under the name of Enchantress! Each of them are gifted in combat with few having super powers! Unlike those 12 rated DC films which have 0 kick in them in terms of style or maturity, this is one of the few greats among Deadpool & Kick Ass. These films actually have a kick of Adrenalin & really shift gear & well is the perfect intense tonic you need after watching that pre teened crap! Films like Kick Ass, Deadpool & especially Suicide Squad ooze with style & class!The music choice in this film was great as well & made the film more epic as it went on! Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes to Paranoid by Black Sabbath! What more could you ask for!?The violence & action sequences were epic too! Not exactly gory but that don't matter one bit! This film was bloody epic hands down! My favourite character from the film had to be the sexy babe honey bun Harley Quinn!! She was damn fit & made the film! Margot Robbie!! Babe alert!! The Joker, Deadshot, Boomerang & the others were also bad arse villains!I overall though this film was epic! Go & see this film! It'll be criminal if you don't! Screw those critics from the frauded website Rotten Tomatoes! They're talking out their arse! I give this a 10/10! EPIC!!",10,6,16,4 August 2016
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Overrated.
","Seen trailers for this film a couple of times & knew I had to see it. Not because of the fake rave reviews this film has been receiving, but because it got my attention & as I do, I go & watch the film with with an open mind & see if it's any good. Well sadly, that wasn't the case with this film. I mean there was some funny moments in it & some good points, but the film just seemed to go nowhere. In other words, it just seemed to string you on throughout the film with plot points here & there & just when you thought it was actually getting to the heart of what the film's climax was about, it ends...! That's it! A typical cliff hanger! So lazy, & so unimaginative! The film is about woman named Mildred living in Ebbing, Missouri. We find out just 5 minutes in, that her daughter was raped & burned to death a few years back, but the case to find the person who done it went cold. So Mildred who is driving home one day spies the billboards en route, & decides to put them to her own personal use by putting up a message directed at the sheriffs department to prompt them to re-open the case & find the person responsible.The films concept is unique & different. You already know the story about 20 minutes in but there was certain parts which made you think the film wasn't going to be as straight forward as it let on to be. The sheriff having cancer was just an instant turn off for me. You thought the film was going to get good the second he knew about the billboards, but then he has cancer & dies prematurely in the film. Similar to how Jigsaw was killed off early in the Saw franchise, he was killed off in Saw III but more films followed, but that's another rant. Anyway, there didn't seem to much of a war between him & Mildred. Which I would've liked considering it would've at least stuck to the story more & probably would've had a decent enough ending. But the films story derailed & spiraled around erratically from plot point to plot point, while being laced with scene to scene of this moody old hag 99% of the film! Some scenes seemed to stray away from the deal with the billboards, the film itself got lost in the middle, & when it finally did get back on track, it ended! I even felt the film dragged & the scenes of Mildred acting out like a bratty 16 year old slag, didn't help! I mean the scenes in question weren't all bad, but the pacing & the quantity of them felt both distracting & out of place! Even when the film did get to the good parts, they themselves dragged & then the ending which, I had a feeling was going to leave a cliffhanger ending &... Ding Ding Ding Ding Ding!! Cliffhanger it was!!Some scenes were pretty funny & there was some good stuff going on. Although the scenes you see where utterly implausible to real life & how certain situations happen, they still were nonetheless, entertaining. But began to get a little old as the film wore on. I also have to say, the film felt unbalanced & all over the place. It dragged on & felt stretched out, unlike getting to the point of what the title was. The film lost it's way & forgot what it was supposed to be. Idiots moaned at the exact things I'm pointing out here in this film about Suburbicon, which got negative reviews, but that film was simple & entertaining. Which brings me to another issue, the title. It's too damn long & difficult to remember to say when buying a ticket at the cinema. It would've been better to title the film Three Billboards! Shot & sweet & simple. Unlike this film which is long than the actual title, which is left to be desired considering the film doesn't sum up the point of the film, let alone the title itself. The point & title of the film quickly diminishes in the first 5 minutes. Long story short, the film starts great, derails, strings you along, get back on track, then ends on a cliffhanger. Incredible. Overall a poor disappointing film that had potential, had a unique concept, but was unfinished, dragged out, & ironically enough proves that once again that money talks & bullsh!t walks the critical acclaim coming from over paid film critics who'll easily give this tripe a critical acclaim of 10/10 rating for the sake of billions of £££. The fact that nearly over 30 film festivals have screen this film is shocking. This film could've been so much better had it got to the point instead of derailing & re-tracking again for the space of nearly an hour. Rating: 2/10",2,5,12,21 January 2018
Baby Driver," Cold Hard Thriller!
","Having seen the TV Series Spaced created by the man himself & of course, Scott Pilgrim Vs The World, I wasn't surprised this would be somewhat good! But didn't think it be even better than what I thought it would be!Baby Driver is about a young man named Leon who as a child was involved in a traumatic car accident killing both his parents, his dad the abusive one & his mum, the one who cared for him & was a good singer. This had lead to him having a condition where he has ringing in his ears & always listens to loud music to drown out the ringing. So basically he somehow gets pulled into a gang who rob banks & set up heists & becomes the getaway driver for each heist! But after doing a few jobs & paying back his debts & starting a new life he gets lured in once again to a job which fails & then leads to more trouble with his personal life & criminal life which also spirals rapidly out of control!The film was amazing! From start to finish it was simply ace! The action! The music! The face spaced car chase sequences! The gun battles! You simply couldn't ask for more in this film! It was just bad arse! It was twisted & humorous in all the right ways! The women in this was fit as f**k! The dark humour in this film also was just epic! The music choice was upbeat & kept you on the edge of your seat!The only slight be of criticism I have is the fact that the ending was a bit off, but it ended happy nonetheless before the credits rolled!Amazing Film! 10/10",10,20,38,1 July 2017
The Thing," Class Horror!
","Finally got around to watching this after hearing much of the controversy from it's first screening to now how it's become a cult classic.The film centers around a base out in the Ant Arctica where a crew are attacked by an alien like creature which manifests itself by mimicking its host.I found the film to be quite good. Gory, voilent & very screwed up. The action was non stop & kept you locked in.The story-line was simple & straight forward which was great as it's more about the graphics & action in this one.Overall a great watch! 8/10",8,0,1,14 August 2019
Split," A Good Watch
","Heard about this in Uni via a friend of mine, though when I looked it up it was more a thriller than a Horror, though it's branded & is a Horror with a Psychological Theme laced into it! It was actually really good, though I honestly don't think it's the best I've seen it was a good watch!The film is about a man who has a mental health illness, his name is Dennis & he has 23 different personalities with the 24th being the most deadliest out of them all! He kidnaps 3 young teenage girls & locks them up in a cell together. Throughout the film, he switches from at least 10-15 personalities in the space of roughly over 30- 40mins of the film. The girls have to not only how to escape their incarceration, but to escape Dennis & his f**ked mine & personalities by over coming & winning over each before the 24th & most deadliest comes!It's not bad considering the It's an M Night Shayaman Film! The guy who produced Devil in 2010 & also made The Visit in 2015 it was a good film, definitely above average, though not really good enough for me to buy it on DVD in 3-4 months time! But it was good! The female actresses were gorgeous honeys too & I especially liked Anya Taylor-Joy! She was great & adorable in it! Shes drop dead gorgeous generally! James McAvoy does a good job in this flick also!It wasn't bloody, though it did have some violent scenes in it. So at least that was something. I would say it was too psychological for my tastes as I myself like gory, bloody in you face horrors with more obvious concepts!I give this an average rating of 7/10, it was a good watch, though not the best I've seen. But I do recommend you watch this one! It's pretty interesting & good!",7,1,10,24 January 2017
Silver Linings Playbook," Great!!
",Great film! Really well put together! Great acting & good story line!Despite the film being predictable at some points I thought it was pretty well done! ***Contains Spoilers***I like how he befriends someone after he gets out of a psychiatric hospital & how he meets someone who is in the same sort of position he was in & how they get together at the end how he manages to over come something which triggered his anger off recovering from a very bad moment he once had! Wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this advertised but I knew somehow it was going to be a very good film & found it to be enjoyable!,10,2,12,22 November 2012
Now You See Me," Great Film! Epic Magic Tricks!
","When seeing this advertised I knew it was going to be a great film! The 'rob a bank' line got me interested!The magic tricks in this film were pretty good! Like when Henley Reeves was trapped in the piranha tank! And got out in the last minute! That was good! Liked the mentalist Merritt McKinney! He was funny as! 4 gifted magicians come together via tarot cards & form a known as The Four Horseman! They then perform in Las Vegas as 'The Four Horsemen' sponsored by Arthur Tressler, an insurance magnate. For the finale of their performances, the Four Horsemen invite a member of the audience to help them in their next trick: robbing a bank. The man is apparently teleported to a bank in Paris, where he activates an air duct which vacuums up the money and showers it onto the crowd in Las Vegas. I like how the group manipulated the man into going to Las Vegas! Very clever!Liked the performance they done, when they stole 140 Million from Tresslers Bank Account and distributing it to the audience, which comprises people whose insurance claims had been denied or reduced by Tressler's company. That was ace! Well done! Especially when the mentalist, Merritt got some of the audience to be football players & they dived onto the stage on top of FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes when he attempted to catch The Four Horseman!They bit when Rhodes and Dray locate the group's hideout and confront Wilder! & The chase sequence when Wilder attempts to escape in a stolen car, but during the chase it flips and explodes. I liked how cleverly the group performed the safe heist through use of mirrors! When they realised they were chasing the wrong safe! How well it was explained & how it confused the police/FBI! The group were 2 steps ahead of them! Awesome! And not to mention how Wilder faked his own death! And how the bridge sequence on the bridge was done to confuse them, Merritt being the bus driver with the duplicate car with the dead body from the morgue! When they preformed their final performance & rained fake money onto the crowd & the real money bursting out of Bradley s car & him getting arrested by the FBI! He then reveals to be the 5th Horseman to Bradley who is now stuck in prison! The group are surprised to discover Rhodes is the benefactor who assembled them the previous year, and he initiates them into The Eye.It then ends with Dray & Rhodes meeting & him explaining that Lionel Shrike, was the magician who drowned years ago. Rhodes says he designed the Horsemen plot to obtain revenge on those involved: Bradley, for humiliating his father, and potentially even sabotaging the trick; the bank in Paris and Tressler's company, which refused to pay insurance on his father's death; and the company that produced the safe used in the trick. Due to the inferior quality of metal used to construct the safe, it warped, resulting in Rhodes' father's inability to escape it. I just like how it connected together so well! Great film! The tricks got me & how they were done were spectacular! Go see it! You won't be disappointed! 9/10",9,1,5,10 July 2013
Die Hard 2," Epic Sequel!
",I know from the get go that I will get hate because of my love for this film & my average review for the original film. But each to their own. I liked this better than the first because the badarse villain & the epic action sequences.The film is set on Christmas Eve & John McClain is once again in the wrong place at the wrong time as Col. Stuart takes control of the Airport control system in order to extract Esperanza who is to stand trial for drug trafficking charges in the US. John latches onto their plan & does whatever he can to stop them.The film is epic! The action sequences & visuals were just stunning! The explosions were insane! The cockpit & ending were my highlights! The villain was badarse & great!I know people who love the first film will disagree with me but hey it's my opinion & review of this film & I thought it was epic & craps over the first one! I know there's many inaccuracies & factual errors but hey it's a film! What do you expect!?Overall this is really epic sequel that deserves more credit than it's due! 10/10,10,0,0,21 March 2020
Yesterday," Ok, but I don't entirely get it...
","Seen this tonight & was intrigued by the premise of the film following the trailers.But after watching I'm kind of left wondering what to think of this film. Like it had good parts in it, but also had parts which made the film hard to take seriously, let alone the film itself, which I think simply couldn't decide what it wanted to be.The film is about a young man who after being hit by a bus around the time the entire earth lost power for 12 seconds, wakes to find that nobody knows about 1960's Band, The Beatles.I found the concept interesting, but very weird, far fetched not to mention too off the rails. The parts when the young man tries to look up The Beatles, Cigarettes or even Coke Cola was while funny at times, was annoying & pretty stupid for its own good. John Lennon suddenly being alive was the cherry on the cake, the film clearly takes place in 2018-2019/Present day, yet because of an outage, The Beatles to Coke-A-Cola & other things suddenly became forgettable. Why & what? It made no sense !The Beatles being the main reason for the sudden disappearance was 1 thing but plot convenience things likes Cigarettes, Coke Cola to even Harry Potter was just dumb, funny, but dumb & got old very quickly. Another niggle was why The Beatles were forgotten by a simple power outage, all trace of them went missing, their songs, web pages, Wiki page etc. Yet everyone, even the internet, cleared all trace of them. I'm it's not as if the whole earth was plagued by some toxic nerve or trance gas!The good points were the scenes in how the guy got famous & how he got together with the love interest at the end. The film was surprisingly enticing & engaging despite the plots hole, weirdness, overall undecided execution, plot & script continence.Overall, this film simply couldn't decide what it wanted to be and was plot holed throughout. While enticing it was the premise and stupidity of the film which made it hard to take seriously. 5/10",5,1,5,29 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Too long, Overrated, Mediocre, Badly Paced, Etc
","Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being 'king' or 'leader' of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10",2,74,126,30 April 2019
Mamma Mia!," Truly Amazing!
","10 Years late, but hey remember this film like it was yesterday!I was 13, it was a rainy miserable Friday afternoon & me & my mate & our families went to see this not knowing what to expect! Well after watching we loved it! So much so we seen it at least 3 times afterwards!The film follows a young woman named Sophie who is about to tie the knot with her fiance, Sky. But having not met her father she finds her mums diary with the memories she had with Sophie's 3 possible fathers, Sam, Harry & Bill. So that's basically the story while the film itself is a musical with the Abba songs being the main basis!The film was truly uplifting! I mean, I'm not an Abba fan or anything & like newer, modern music, but this film was great! I'm not even a fan of musicals & yet this one seemed to be watchable & great in every way! I even crushed on Sophie around this time! Such good memories of this film around the time I was a young teenager!Overall 10/10 An amazing film!",10,0,1,29 July 2018
Toy Story 4," Ok Sequel, But Very Unneeded!
","First off, I'm going to start that all the 10/10 reviews on here aren't all genuine as many Toy Story Fans like myself will tell you that a 4th Film is VERY unneeded given the 3rd installment nearly a decade earlier. People hating on this film will be called by cinema snobs & those who think haters have something wrong with them because they don't think the same as those 10/10 reviewers do. But I for one didn't rate this nearly as much as 3 or the previous 2 before that one.So 9 Years on we get Toy Story 4. Now at the time, I was looking forward to it. But as I grew older I started to lose interest as it was taking so long. But because as the years have past I started to notice a trend in films & sequels much like these child animations being tarnished & corrupted with Political Correctness! Incredibles 2 is a prime example of this.Seen the first film back in '04, loved & never seen a sequel for over a decade (14 Years) & because it was (& still is) in the peak time for PC to be shoved down peoples throats, the sequel was badly tarnished with female empowerment in the left wing & 3rd wave form! I was actually looking forward to it but completely forgot about the PC treatment, so now with this & other films I've been always apprehensive with sequels or remakes/reboots because of that very reason.But this one wasn't too bad, yes it had the PC treatment but it wasn't as bad as I thought. Though you could tell from both dialogue & the visuals that is what it was trying to do, making Bo Peep a badarse type character & woody & the others dumb or stupid, not good! I mean you could see it clearly & it just annoys me why this so called movement has to be done in THAT way? It makes me wonder if they make these sequels just for that reason alone? Mmmm...But the visuals were good, the villain was good. The animation & voice over work was good as always, but the ending was a bit crap & not happy. or nearly as emotional as the 3rd film. But I liked Forky, the new character.Overall Ok, but VERY unneeded & made only for the excuse of PC & money! 5/10",5,37,79,21 June 2019
Non-Stop," Edgy, Gripping & Epic!
","From seeing the trailer I knew this was going to be a great film!The concept of a plane with 150 passengers on board & an unknown person sending threatening text messages was ace! Your constantly on the edge of your seat thinking who is doing this? How are they doing this? I liked how it used the similar formula to the Scream films, with the whole 'whodunit?' concept! Guessing who it was & every single person being suspects & doubting one another etc! Etc! It worked perfectly & I liked how the film kept you constantly guessing what was happening, piecing together fact by fact!Liam Neeson played the part well as he does in previous films such as the Taken series & Unknown!I liked the dark setting of the film! It reminded me of Flight Plan so much! The psychological mind f**k & how everything seemed to play havoc with your mind wanting you to keep watching till the end piecing everything together like a jigsaw puzzle! Overall it was an awesome film! Very gripping & keeps you on the edge of your seat!10/10",10,1,6,1 March 2014
It Follows," It's wasn't THAT good!
","Seen this tonight after hearing about this film & the hype that came with it! The film I think is maybe too hyped up & heres why:To start I didn't think this film was all that! I mean, it was OK, but I felt the film just went no where & was very badly explained. It was like the film just gave up after an hour or so! I did enjoy the jump scares & Maika Monroe (gorgeous!!) being in it. But I just felt the film didn't have half as much of a kick to it as it showed!The film pretty much is about a 19 year Jay, who after having sex with her boyfriend encounters weird visions & entities following her/trying to kill her! The film however does this well...for about an hour or so but ends up not explaining the events afterwards as it plods along! As I said, the film at that point just gave up & went nowhere! The ending was just bland & makes these abrupt endings like the Paranormal Activity Franchise, The Devil Inside & others seems like proper well thought out endings it was that bland!I really don't get why people like this film! I mean it was food & creepy, but it lacked explanation primarily because people now just expect you to know whats going on as if your mind readers which irritates me! The film just lacked kick so much & got pretty boring after a while! Like I said the hype of this film is stupid! It wasn't worth 98% (previously 100%) on Rotten Tomatoes! Or the 7.3 rating on this website here! It annoys the sh*t out of me so much how critics are swift to slander films 98% of films which aren't all bad & yet they seem to like films like this which don't even scratch the surface of 'good'! Annoys me how they pick & choose with their worthless opinions like everyone HAS to agree with them! Idiots! Overall I think this film was way over hyped & not really that good to call 'outstanding' or 'amazing'! The ending sucked arse! I mean come on! THAT was an ending, really? The director got aids or something? I don't know.To be fair it delivered some good creepy scares & freaky moments here & there & with Maika Monroe (beautiful!!) in it I gave it a 4 for those reasons! Overall not really that good! Don't be a gullible git like the rest & go by what the critics say! Their opinions are worthless like a car with no engine!4/10",4,15,109,3 March 2015
Avengers: Infinity War," Drags & Drags...
","Seriously when are these editors going to get their crap together & cut it! Hm? You don't need to drag a film on & on for what seems like an eternity! Cut the crap! Cut it! Get to the point already!!As usual, story-line was confusing, too wrapped up with own issues other than saving peoples lives, which is what these films have missed the point of over time, not to mention bad editing, & poorly executed narrative. They weren't speaking English as I had no idea what they were talking about half the time or should I say most of the time! Maybe if they cut the cra[ & made the film snappy it probably would've made more sense & instead of dragging the climax out in such a choppy changing like manner (what climax, I'll get to that later) anyway, as well as repetitive, the climaxes ending was all over the place! Bad guys gets 'killed', comes back again, gets killed, comes back, more chopping & changing, then a slow dragged out scene, then back to the climax! The end outstayed its welcome, & well as soon as it got to the 2hr mark, you knew they need to wrap it up, but it took another 40mins to do that! Damn!And the ending... don't make me laugh!! The ending could've happened much much sooner! So much so they dragged out a climax for this? I mean the ending was an insult alone, without the other reason being that it took them nearly an hour till they gave us this pile of horse crap! Oh my god!!Overall crap! DON'T watch! 2/10",2,235,571,8 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Great film!
","Having only seen a couple of Tarantino's films, I knew to expect something f--ked up in this one, even though I knew from reading that this wasn't going to be a one of his typical films.The first 2 hours of the film is good, but doesn't feature the typical QT violence or action. However, the last 37 minutes does provide what QT fans like myself have been waiting for.The visuals were good, the violence (even though it's only 1/4 of it) was ace as hell! The acting & dialogue were also pretty good! The film had quite a few bad arse moments in it! The only issues I had with the film was it dragged, it was too long winded & also the film could've befitted with more violent QT scenes.Overall this film was pretty epic, aside from the lack of QT violence! 9/10",9,16,26,17 August 2019
Get Out," Twisted
","Heard about this one last year & had to put it on my list of 'must watches' as it was both a Horror & interesting film (from the sound of it anyway). So after tonight's viewing, I can say it was a pretty good film! Twisted & sinister in all forms & levels. Not to mention political too, but it's true to reality of slavery happening in this day & age as it sadly does happen still. The film seemed to get more fast paced nearing the end & there was some really good scenes which I won't spoil for you as you have to see this one yourselves!The film is about a young black man named Chris, who meets Rose, a nice young lady who he's has been dating for 2 months or so. The days arrives when Chris goes to meet Rose's parents, who seem somewhat eccentric & odd in their behaviours. The mum is a counselor & the father has black slaves going about doing house chores! Then after one night when the mother tries to 'cure' Chris of his smoking addiction, she hypnotises him. Though things seem to get more & more odd as after a party, a black slave orders Chris to 'Get Out!' thereby shortly after the family are into some serious slavery & Chris is not the first as many others are hypnotised & 'not with it'. He then realises the family, let along his gf, are not who the appear to be...!The kills were pretty good, same old, same old but hell I'm easily pleased when there's some blood splattering gore going about! I'm a sucker for it! But it was good & better than nothing, which to be fair I was fearing as the film went on. But it kicked in eventually & it seemed to be quite satisfying & worth the wait when it got down to it!The ending was quite satisfying & nearly seemed to go down the judgemental route, but turned around swiftly to a happy & satisfying ending! I was pleased it ended the way it did, but I won't give away how it ended!Overall, I give this film a solid 9/10 rating! It was pretty sinister & twisted, not to mention a good take on modern day slavery!",9,9,17,18 March 2017

","Having not seen the 1994 original (cos I was born in the year the film was released), I went to see this due to the hype.I must say it was pretty good! With the enhanced visuals & different actors this film was a good watch!The fact that it isn't a cartoon & a live action type film is refreshing! I also think it is great that the film being remade is so that young people of this generation can experience the great story!This film is pretty good! Give it a watch! 8/10",8,2,9,20 July 2019
The Incredibles," Amazing Film!! Up There With The Classics!!
","Saw this when I was 10 Years Old back in late 2004 & bloody loved it from the get go! So much so, me & my family seen it 3 times!! It was simply amazing!!The story-line is simply great & epic! It follows Bob Par as a super strength hero saving people lives among others including his wife, Elastagirl! They all get out lawed by the public who are too fickle & ungrateful to understand there goals in saving the world & protecting the innocent. So 15 years on we see Bob & his now family with Violet & Dash, both also born with powers living a normal life, but Bob simply can't get away from his hero lifestyle so he & his best mate Frozone secretly save lives & continue to fight crime, but a past fanboy, Syndrome wants vengeance from Mr. Incredible!The film was just epic in every aspect! It was dark, funny, raw & simply one of the best films Pixar have ever made! I even recall having a crush on Violet when I was younger after seeing this film! It really does remind me of my childhood & basically the older days back in the early 00's which was a great time to grow, especially when watching films like this one that never ever seem to get old or boring & can be watched over & over again!Overall this film gains a rare but strong & solid, 10/10!Classic film! Go watch it!",10,3,5,18 July 2018
A Quiet Place," Interesting, but not amazing!
","Seen trailers & previews of this film several months before release, but took it to be a supernatural type film as the said previews & trailers didn't 'give' much away in terms of what 'it' was that was attacking the family.The concept is new & interesting, it follows a family living in the wilderness but have to remain absolutely silent to avoid attracting the 'alien' like creatures attacking them. That's it. Simple. You already know of the concept before actually watching the film, so without having to show anything, they've already spoilt it right there, but I suppose it's watching the film play out & seeing how it ends is what you have to find out from watching it.I thought the film was alright in general. Not amazing or something I'd brag about to friends let alone buy on DVD. But it was ok. Though judging from the 10/10 reviews I can't help but think they're fake or paid reviewers at it again to try & make this film something more than what it actually was by using words like 'crafted' or 'art' all in all with a 'post-Blair-Witch-1999' overtone while simultaneously slagging off other Horrors Films for being Horrors only because they use cliches which actually make horror & not atypical concepts with weak & watery premises that are flawed badly or not well executed! I'll be honest & say, I didn't feel all that tense. You KNOW you're going to be alright as it's ONLY a film! I watch horrors for enjoyment, because they're meant to be watched & enjoyed as visual media & not that of a theme park horror maze or ride! A couple of reviewers were saying it was tense & that the film was an experience obviously have little to no imagination or are scared of their own shadows!I also found the film to be a bit boring at points! I like my horrors in-your-face & gory, this lacked that & I felt that attacks 'shied away' too much & didn't show a lot. I also felt the alien concept was a bit crap. But saying that, it wasn't bad, because unlike Blair Witch you saw something, while my expectations ironically enough my provocations were more Blair Witch driven before seeing this film.I also find that films like this seem to be praised too much. Babadook, It Follows & Blair Witch join the queue for this film. They seem to be praised yet each have boring, weak & watery premises. They are atypical yet amazing films (which they aren't.) Overall, an ok film, 5/10.",5,2,3,17 April 2018
1917," Well Shot Film
","Seen a screening of this tonight & was locked in from the start.While I'm not a fan of War Films as such but this one was well done & a great watch surprisingly.The film follows 2 soldiers who are crossing enemy lines to deliver a message in the first World War. However, their task is far from easy & plain sailing as they encounter many dangers ahead of them.I found the film to be quite enjoyable. You felt the suspence as you watched because the film was edited in a way to appear as if you're with the soldiers on their perilous journey.Not a bad film & actually one of the best War Films out there.9/10",9,13,20,15 January 2020
Event Horizon," Craving for the 130 minute uncut version!
","Heard about this film earlier this year & saw from the graphic visuals that I had to have it! Not a big Sci-Fi fan myself, but gave this one the exception with the great visuals & bloody effects which I must I say were epic as hell!The film is about some space crew members who go off in search of other crew members who went missing on a voyage through space at Event Horizon. Though they discover something far more sinister & dark when they get there!I found the film to be pretty good, considering I know little about Sci-Fi. Especially the terms, phrases & things they were saying, but it was good & sort of understandable. The gore effects were good though I had heard before watching that there is about 30 minutes of lost footage which got ditched because some pussy wimpy screen testers fainted from the strong extreme gore used! Now that to me was how it should have been, though the film didn't disappoint in terms of gore or graphic violence, I felt the uncut version should've been kept if not released, there is however hope of an uncut release as far back as 2012, though it's been for years & we haven't heard anything since...but fingers crossed! I felt the gore effects in this film were quite restricted & not prolonged enough & could've done with a lot more disgusting vile gore & maggots! But like I said, it was acceptable enough despite the disappointment in the toned down violence! The death scenes were decent enough & some of the visuals didn't disappoint too much. It was an OK kind of film & one worth watching & if not re-watching & this is coming from someone who doesn't much like Sci-Fi films! The ending was satisfying enough & not clichéd like other horror film endings! But it was good. At only 91 minutes & the fast paced feeling I did quite enjoy how fast it moved, though for the sake of seeing prolonged gore & bloody extreme violence I would've wanted it to be longer & wouldn't have minded despite it being Sci-Fi & slightly confusing. I would've killed for the prolonged deleted scenes!I overall found this film to be pretty good despite the lack of gore & prolonged visuals of graphic violence which could've been prolonged more. I would've liked to have seen some graphic blood splattering violence, but unfortunately no. I'm so hoping for the 130 minute directors cut that we've been deprived of all these years!I give this flick a 7/10. If the bloody gory vile scenes were prolonged more & some good bloody kills I would've gave this film a 9 rating, but this cut version gets a generous 7/10! Give this a watch if you like bloody horrors, I did & it was pretty decent! I don't like Sci-Fi films, but with the exception of horror I watched it!

","Woah!!I was blown away by this film! The trailer, for once! Didn't give any of the gory bits away! I mean it was just spectacular! I can't remember the last time I seen a viscous, dark scary intense film like this! It was just amazing!!The opening was ace! The Abomination of the girl getting burned from the start by her father & her threatening him before she dies when he then shoots her with a shotgun! Then the opening title 'Evil Dead' appearing on screen! Epic!!I also liked how the story starts off with Mia getting increasingly stressed through out the film & things rapidly spiralling out of control! Eric & David go into the basement only find animals hanging from barb wire & a book which Eric, so foolishly reads the chant, to reawaken the demons! Then things really get nasty!! When Mia says they'll all die! I was like! This'll be great!The blood was just top notch! I mean the bits I really liked were when Mia Cut her tongue in half with the Stanley knife! Man that was ace! When Natalie got possessed & started shooting both David & poor Eric who had been ripped to shreds by her & Olivia who had previously (after cutting her mouth open with a knife which was jaw droppingly wicked!!) stabbed Eric in the chest, then he fell back & hit his back on the toilet seat, then she stabbed him repeatedly with a syringe!! Just epic! Then Eric killing her with a piece of the toilet lid & causing her head to be splattered all over the floor! Natalie then getting dragged into the basement! Then the Stanley knife cutting through the tongue which I just mentioned! Then Mia who is now possessed threatening David & calling him a f**king idiot & Saying his sister is getting raped in hell! Badass line! Natalie cutting off her arm after being bitten from Mia when her wound becomes infected! Extremely gory!!! Then her getting possessed & nail gunning David & Eric! Eric who has already sustained so much excruciating pain & suffering! When Natalie starts whacking him & David with a steel rod!! David saves Eric's ass again after he gets victimised & walloped repeatedly with the steel rod (Poor guy!)then David shoots off her arm with a shotgun & kills her right after she becomes un-possessed! Eric after saving David from getting drowned by Mia dies & gets forgotten about until then end when he comes back alive & stabs David in the neck, when David nearly kills Mia, until he dose the live burial & jump starts her heart back when the spirit 'supposingly' dies! David then shuts out Mia & he & Eric get burned to death inside the cabin which David previously soaked with petrol!And just when you think it's over it rains blood & Mia & the evil spirit have a final showdown! Mia kills the spirit after it chases her through a shed, nearly stabs her with a machete! Vicious! Then Mia, chainsaws the spirits foot off & cut the spirit in half killing her! Then the rain stopping & her looking toward the sunlight & limping toward the exit in the woods!Overall, a very, very , very!! Gory, viscous & epic film! Very impressed with this one! Horror fans, you won't be disappointed! Go see this film! Can't wait for Evil Dead 2! Another remake which hopefully will be good! 10/10",10,50,97,18 April 2013
Jurassic World," A great entry into the franchise
","Having only seen large segments of the original 1993 Jurassic Park film & not the other installments I'd have to say seeing this in 3D was pretty kick-arse considering it took them nearly 15 years to make this film which from what I've read has been in development hell since 2004/2005 time.Not a die hard fan of the franchise myself. I found this to be a pretty satisfying film with great effects & scenes which delivered some intense & slightly bloody moments which I quite liked! The part where the dinosaur bursts out of the water & eats the shark was one of my favourite sequences!The ending was pretty good too, but I won't spoil it for you as it was pretty epic & reminded me of Lake Placid 4 abit.I overall would give this film a 8/10 it was decent film with great effects & action!",8,7,21,11 June 2015
Logan," Raw, Bloody & Pure Epic!
","Never been a fan of the Marvel Films in all honesty. I think it simply comes from me not being a fan to the 12+ theme, violence & humour. Not to mention the dragged out scenes, the dumb premise, the overuse of CGI, the classic saving lives theme being dropped, over complicated dialogue story-line... I could go on. I do however like 15+ rated Marvels Films, they simply are better, raw & not afraid to let loose unlike the others which are simply too restrained!So, after getting Kick Ass's 1+2, Deadpool & Suicide Squad, we get Logan! Now from hearing about it, I had a feeling it was going to be a 12+, but from seeing the age rating, 15+ I had a feeling this was going to be good, & I was not wrong!The film is about Logan (Wolverine) finding out he has a daughter, who apparently is just like him. Has the claw ability. So with some villains after him, his daughter & Xavier you have Logan!The gore & blood in this film were beyond epic! It was exactly how I would do it! Only mines would be an 18+! But hey the violence & kill scenes were epic as f**k! They were simply epic!The ending was sad but raw & solid! I thought this was an awesome film! Overall 10/10!!!!",10,2,6,4 March 2017
Midsommar," Extremely Disappointing!
","From the writer & director who brought you the, ok but slow & boring Hereditary comes this 2.0 version bore of a film which makes that film seem Oscar worthy.I didn't exactly have high expectations of this film due to the writer & directors previous film, Hereditary being pretty boring & slow. It had the same poor directional, bad cinematography & overall poor editing seen in this film, but it was ok & had some creepy things going on in it. Hereditary at least was a horror film & executed that well throughout, plus it was shorter...So with that film comes another from the same writer & director, Midsommar. Long story short, the film is about a group of young 20 something's who head off to Sweden & part take in a wicker man like cult.While I knew this already from the trailers & previews, the film had little else to go on, but you'd expect a film that is 2 hours & 22 minutes to at least have something to go on if not a lot. But the film didn't sadly. The film for 3/4 is basically the group milling about this compound, sleeping, eating, drinking, drug taking, sitting, dancing & part taking in the weird activities this cult have for them. Only 1/4 of the film was horror. It's pretty sad to be honest. I felt the film was way too overloaded with the various activities you saw in the film if not extremely repetitive. The film could've been shorten down by at least 40 minutes tops, saving the rest for either a home release or keep them as deleted scenes. Slow burner or not, this just took the biscuit for pacing & was more frustrating, if not annoying to watch if anything else. Not entertaining.There would be a lot of scenes which dragged & dragged awkwardly for no reason, even the cut clips themselves in the said scenes. There would even be suspenseful scenes which would take forever in a day to get to the 'point' or 'pay off' it was 'supposedly going to until it would then cut to another scene. Annoying & yet this writer & director claims this is a horror?
The opening was bad too, not very bad, but not very good either. Don't get me wrong it was sinister, but it dragged & you felt it after the 3 minute mark. Even the part after the phone call sequence when Dani discovered her sister had killed herself & their parents via gassing from a gas exhaust from a running car dragged. You'd be sitting there thinking 'come on, just get to the point what's happening!?' a lot of scenes did this in the film as I stated above. Not to mention the scenes that did do this cheated you & lead on into nothing. The opening was 12 minutes & 30 seconds long. You get over the opening at around 5 minutes, but to see title of the film & the opening credits roll after that long seems very tedious if not ridiculous.The film itself was just filled with a lot of 'what the hell!?' moments, even funny ones to be honest. The scenes would either be random, out of place or just badly put together with little to no narrative whatsoever. Not even in the obvious in terms of narrative.Annoying parts included excessive wailing, crying, yelling & nauseousness. This again has a lot to do with the pacing & poor editing this film had. Even the parts which were suppose to be visually artistic got on your nerves as you just wanted them to get to the point & move on, the film travelled at a snails pace & felt way to over padded. Watching slugs race to even paint dry would be more fun than this. The film didn't even scare me at all, little to no horror. The film was more annoying & bizarre even for its own good to watch. I don't get the entertainment value. There was no plot to speak of & the film simply went nowhere. It fizzled out after the first 40 minutes.However the acting was good, the gore effects were ok but nothing which in my mind would warrant an 18+ certificate from the BBFC. I seen more gore & violence in this year Superhero Horror Film, Brightburn which was only 15+. Crazy.The director & writer himself claimed that Hereditary wasn't his first horror, but this film was? What? Ari Aster said that Midsommar was his first (then) going to be his first as Hereditary was just a 'family drama' type film. The statement itself couldn't be more pungent in irony as Hereditary was more of a horror than this film would ever be.Overall the film was flat out terrible & one the worst horror films of 2019 & one of the worst films overfall for this year alone. Ari Aster shouldn't make anymore of these films unless he looks at what went wrong with this one. Critics, cinema snobs & Rotton Tomatoes especially will praise this mess for either biased views on what makes a good horror film alone, to what makes a good film in general. I disliked this film & found it to be disappointing in the extreme. 1/10",1,21,36,10 July 2019
Saw," Outstanding!!
",Upon watching the Saw films for the first time I had chills! This was like my first time watch something which I heard was gruesome & intense! ***Contains Spoilers***As soon as the opening to the bathroom scene came I was like 'This is going to be ace!' As with the rest of the film! I just thought the twists were pretty good! How they discovered that Zepp was a JigSaw Victim & how they led us to believe it was the killer himself & how they connected the fact as to why he kidnapped Doctor Gordon & Adam he need Dr. Gordon who was the one who said to John (JigSaw) he was going to die & how Zepp was also involved & been poisoned with a slow killing poison & needed an antidote so he used Dr. Gordon & how the JigSaw killer was laying on the ground pretending to be dead all along (Us not even knowing it was him!) & how everything just came together in a way which was understandable! There's lots I could say about this film as to how well put together it was! The ending was great too! 'GAME OVER!' #SLAM!# & my best mate saying 'What a film!' Ace 10/10,10,0,1,22 November 2012
Sinister," Scary, Gripping & Twisted!
","Since watching the trailer to this film & seeing the poster I just had to see this one! Being a horror Guru I was not disappointed! It was gripping, intense, suspenseful & gave you loads of jumping-out-of-your- seat scares! ***Contains Spoilers***The story line about this guy moving into a house to write a book finding footage of the previous families that moved in getting killed in the most sadistic ways by each & every one of the children getting possessed by this supernatural killer with a very scary face! Not to mention the weird goings on like his son drawing a picture of a family getting hung from a tree & the super 8 film player turning on, on it's own! Then him finding the extended footage along with the films & player he thought he had burned at the end when they thought they were safe! Then getting brutally killed by their own daughter! Very scary & a must see for horror fanatics!10/10",10,9,13,22 October 2012
Reservoir Dogs," Solid film
","This was one of those films I kept meaning to watch but never got round to doing so. I have only seen a handful of QTs films but have been starting to watch the classics like Pulp Fiction since seeing his newest works, Once Upon A Time... In Hollywood was his newest film & while not as gory as The Hateful Eight, still delivers a pretty good film.So back to this one, Reservoir Dogs is about a Diamond heist gone wrong. 6 men who don't know eachothers identities find themselves in betrayal siruation, who ratted them out?I found the film to be pretty good. I like the style in both editing & story telling that QTs Films have. The music in the film was good. That razor scene was classic. Only thing I didn't like was the lack of gore the film had. However, the film was still very voilent all the way.Overall, a classic 90s QT Film. 8/10",8,0,0,31 December 2019
Don't Breathe," Don't Start
","Was looking forward to this ever since April/July this year & couldn't wait to see it. The story/concept sounded really interesting & looked as though it was going to be a pretty good film with a unique concept.Unfortunately, the film just lost it's buzz & excited as soon as it began. The film concept is simple, 3 teens break into a blind mans home (he's an Ex War Veteran) & steel his compensation money. It seemed to be a good film & sounded it, but it didn't deliver in a way I thought it would. It kept me excited when I first heard about it but when it came to watching I wasn't as blown away by it. I mean, don't get me wrong. The film was alright & had some suspenseful moments which kept you watching. It was creepy & had some jumpy moments in it. It also found it interesting to see what they could do with the concept of an Ex War Veteran who is blind & how he uses his military army skills to combat these intruders. As everyone would assume he's the vulnerable one & these 3 intruders have the upper hand, though we all know the film wants us to assume that. But know differently.But anyway, it was poor & disappointing as it got to the end. I also found that none of the characters, not even the creepy jerk were likable or even redeeming. You couldn't feel sorry for the intruders because of their nasty heartless intentions (well 2 of the 3 as only 1 of them had a heart... slightly), & you certainly couldn't feel sorry for the War Veteran as he also had a dark nasty little secret down in his basement. So it was pretty difficult who to root for. I also had problems with the continuity errors, like the dog disappearing & reappearing at random points. Also the plot holes, like the police not finding the DNA of the female intruder who shredded enough blood to fill a bucket & enough hair to cover a bald gits head! Unbelievable. The female soul survivor ending was clichéd, cheap & just plain sexist! This is 2016 & these idiots still go for that? Hah! This is coming from someone who says the film doesn't reply on 'cheap scares' oh the irony! So, she got away with the money, left her friends for dead & that poor old git get's robbed blind (pardon the pun) & doesn't say sh!t despite DNA evidence in the house that could place her at the scene of the crime! Layabouts like her expect to earn money by not getting a job, typical in this day & age!The kills were tame & the blood lacked in certain areas, again another boner from the director saying his Evil Dead remake was too gory! Idiot, that's what we need! Films now have really gone down hill for slashers what happened to the days of SAW, Final Destination & Scream!? Not to mention Wrong Turn, Halloween, Friday 13th need I go on? Now everything has to be clever & smart & not straight forward! This film could've ended so much better had that git killed all those nobs!The film did exactly what the first intentions of anyone's ignorant minds did. Blind man's home, has a ton load of £££. Should be easy money! Well it pretty much was when the film started & ended! Didn't have a twist ending where none of them lived or they got caught etc.They pretty much did break in & take his money. I mean, it wasn't easy, aside from a few scuffles, nearly being forced upon by a squirter filled with old man's cream, getting shot repeatedly & assaulted brutally they got there in the end... just about!But in a nut shell, that's exactly what she (they) did! Not a clever film it's hyped up to be! Watch The Strangers or The Purge! Least they deliver well unlike this poor disappointment.4/10 Could've been SO much better!",4,44,90,14 September 2016
The Descent," Gory British Horror!
","Epic opening sequence!The film centers around a group of women (including the one who lost her hubby) who go off to the US to decent down into a series of caves. But things go awry from getting lost to being eaten alive by blind creatures who likes bats, use their ears to sense & kill off their prey.I found the film to be pretty good, only thing that was how long it took the film to officially get going & get well... juicy as it were! But there was plenty of action & suspenseful enough scenes to get you through it.The film relied heavily on survival & paranoia! One of the strongest characters kills an innocent but the weakest becomes the strongest by the end.The ending however, reminded me alot of 47 Meters Down, but this film was a little unsure of what the ending was suppose to be about. Like what it was suppose to mean sort of thing.Overall the film was pretty good! 8/10",8,2,3,17 August 2019
Zombieland," Ace Zombie Comedy!
","Remember this when it came out back in '09 but wasn't big on horrors so never bothered. But with the run up to the sequel coming out this Friday on the 18th, I knew I had to watch this!The film is about 4 survivors of zombie apocalypse which has plagued the US. Columbus, Tallahassee, Witchita & Little Rock. Throughout the film they try to get from A-B, but on the way grow to know one another in all sorts of funny scenarios & rules which the main protagonist Columbus informs the audience at the start of the film & throughout.I found the film to be pretty decent! Not a lot however was going on like that of Shaun of the Dead, but it was a good watch! Funny lines & scenes of violence & comedy all rolled into one 1 hour 20 minute film!Can't wait for the sequel! I just got to hope in the 10 year the sequel has been in development since '09 that the hypersensitive/political correctness police hasn't already ruined it...Overall, this ones a great watch! 8/10",8,1,2,16 October 2019
Die Hard," Great Action Film!
","Just seen a re-release of this tonight at my local for the first time in ages & was impressed!The film is about John McClaine, a NY Police Officer who attends a Christmas party on Christmas Eve only to be suddenly up against a group of German terrorists who plan to rob the place & take out everyone inside, including his ex-wife. It's a race against time for John to stop the terrorists before it's too late.The film is action packed, not non stop action as they're points where the film has character development scenes in it, which is fine as long as they don't drag on too much. Which they didn't thankfully, but yeah the film definitely doesn't disappoint in terms of action.But to say this... IT'S NOT A CHRISTMAS FILM!!! Just because the film is centered around Christmas & has a couple of Christmas themed references in it, DOESN'T mean it's ABOUT Christmas! Had to say that as this argument still even 30 years on is still being debated!Overall, a great action film!8/10",8,1,1,3 December 2019
The Witch," Alright, but not THAT good...
","So another film that is once again over-hyped by critics comes knocking & fails top live up to it's hype! The Witch!The film is basically about a witch that attacks a family in a farm in the 1630's & is hidden thin the form a human being. That's it & so I'll tell you about the film.The film was OK, but not worth the stupid hype & 90% rating on Rotten Tomatoes! I don't get what's so good about this film, I really don't. Why critics seem to like boring crap like this & hate great films that are underrated is beyond me! What goes in their heads!? Anyway...The plot of this film was thin & watery, but not too complicated to say the least. My issue with this film is the fact that it took abit of time to get going & was also quite confusing visually & dialogue wise. It got me abit lost at one point. But, we got there eventually when it DID pick up about 30 minutes in.The dialogue was confusing as with the pacing of the film at the beginning! Why they couldn't speak normally was annoying! I mean it's like talking to someone about Star Wars & them not knowing what your meaning! The film makers & writer/directer obviously got too wound up in this film that they forgot to simplify the dialogue & what was going on in the first 30 minutes, if not the whole film itself! It may be obvious to YOU but it won't be too us! Make it general & not biased! Also in all honesty, as much as I liked the simple plot, it was all TOO simple! Like you could say the plot within 1 sentence within 10 words or less! I mean I like films that have an easy plot generally as films now work too hard to be clever & end up confusing viewers & falling flat on it's face, but the least the could've done was add abit more complexity into it! It was too straight forward & didn't have a twist or clever plot whatsoever! How critics liked this again is beyond me!The film did have some good points to it mind. The kills were interesting, the graphic violence did spice the film up abit & also made up for the first boring 30 minutes! I also liked the actress & the naked women near the end of the film! The goat killing people was quite funny & entertaining!I had a feeling upon watching this film I knew it wasn't going to be epic & judging by the over hype it shows you can't judge a book by it cover! Over hype usually means it's sh!t & under to panned usually means good in the day & age! We also never got to see the witch too which was abit disappointing! I overall found the film to be mediocre & very below average at best! Watch The Boy instead as it's far more entertaining & has a good plot twist unlike this film which is too simple plot wise & too complex & overly confusing visual wise, it should be the other way around complex plot, & simple visuals with great effects! At least then it would be more entertaining & worth the stupid over hype these stupid critics seem to churn up! 5/10",5,1,5,24 March 2016
Sausage Party," Twisted Fun!
","Heard about this one a few months back & knew I had to give it a watch after I saw a trailer for this!The name itself suggested it was 15 rated film made for adults! It didn't fully get my attention until I saw previews.It was a pretty f**ked up film! Funny, twisted & dark in so many levels! It was an interesting watch & the first child's like animation with bad language & adult humour in it!I recommend a watch of this film as it was pretty funny & very f**ked up, but great! It makes a change from seeing this animations only being made for children & now we're moving into the trend where us young adults can enjoy these films with our type of humour in it!9/10",9,6,11,17 September 2016
Joker," Dark Joker!
","Just came back from a screen of this & was blown away by how good it was! I knew it be great anyway, but from actually seeing it, I'm convinced!The film tells the backstory of how the Joker became who he was & what his personal life was like before he snapped & became a cold blood murdering villain!I found the film to be fully engaging! It was dark, blood, brutal & visually stunning! The actors done great jobs & preformed very well by giving convincing portrayals!I'm starting to like the trend in the DC Universe where these 15+ versions are showing us the raw & truly gritty side of these villains/heroes you never get to see in these watered down 12+ versions!Overall an epic, brutal & raw story about the Joker!Go & see this! 10/10",10,6,11,5 October 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Above Average 3rd Entry
","With the epic explosions & epic action sequences of Die Hard 2, you'd think that film would be hard to top. Unfortunately after watching, I have to say I was right. However, I did see it coming before watching. Saying that, the film DID entertain & was pretty action packed & good enough to satisfy.John McClane and Harlem, an Electronics Store Owner are targeted by German terrorist Simon Gruber in New York City, who plans to rob the Federal Reserve Building. He gives orders to the duo to carry out several tasks, failing to do results in him detonating a bomb before saying the phrase 'Simon Says!'.After watching the film I have to admit it was good, not quite as epic as 2 or hell, 1, but it WAS a good film with plenty of action sequences & humour added in to keep you entertained.The ending however was anticlimactic & the score used at the epic ending of Die Hard 2 is heard. But sadly, it didn't work, at all. It came off as poor attempt to be like the ending of it's predecessor. The average action laced with the score used at the end of Die Hard 2 felt out of place & a bit sloppy.But overall this isn't a bad film, it's decent enough & good in its own way. It's definitely worth a watch.7/10",7,0,0,31 March 2020
It Chapter Two," Epic Finale!
","Having seen IT back in 2017, I had to see this sequel, IT Chapter 2!The film follows the 7 friends who now grown adults leading different lives to reunite to stop Pennywise for good!The film was epic! But way too long! I understand that there is 7 characters that all need to be developed & that with Stephen Kings books they're over 1000 pages long, but it isn't the point. The film still could be shorter, snappier & less draggier! There were parts which easily could've been cut out, or fine tuned in order to keep the film within the 2 hour run time.The film did however has some terrifying & gruesome visuals! Pennywise was great as always & the actor playing him done an awesome job!Overall it's a solid sequel which draws you in! 8/10",8,6,10,6 September 2019
Jaws," Good film!
","Having seen a re-release of this back in 2012 this is one interesting shark film that sparked off the shark film craze! Martin Brody the sheriff a small island town of Amity off of New England investigates numerous shark attacks in the water after a young girl goes skinny dipping in the sea & get's attack by an unknown 'killing machine'! It's only until they discover bites marks on a whale that they discover it could be something far worse, a Great White Shark! He & 2 other guys go in search for the shark & to kill it!The film itself was great for it's time. Considering I myself wasn't around then I think it is a unique film all round! The suspense was also great in this film too teasing the audience until 3/4 of the way into the film! It's definitely one of those edge of your seat films admittingly, though in all honesty I have seen better shark films, like Shark Night 3D or Bait 3D which were both epic films, though Jaws is just as great!The kills were OK, not to my standards but OK for a film of this calibre. The ending part was truly great, (Though not as epic as Jaws 2's ending) it was still a great way for the shark to get killed off!I overall, thought this was a great film, not the best I have seen but a true classic! 7/10",7,2,3,7 December 2015
Kong: Skull Island," Great Film!
","Never seen the stupidly long 2005 King Kong & intend to, but went to see this nonetheless as a new film & something to watch. I heard about it & saw a trailer so I had to see what all the fuss was about.So after watching the film, I have to say it was a pretty good watch! It was action packed, full of surprises & well simply a decent film. Now I'm no fan of films like this one, but I still got some enjoyment out of it!Brie Larson was something too! The other actors like Samuel L. Jackson played their roles well also!The action packed parts I think saved this film, & to be quite honest, the film in itself wasn't long for a change about 2 hours is what the 2005 film should've been! Because it was stupidly long! Way too long even for the most die hard of fans, bu this one, was pretty decent & justifying-able in it's length!I'd overall give this an 8/10! It's decent enough & worth a watch!",8,1,8,17 March 2017
The Big Short," Boring, biased & very un-entertaining X Infinity!
","From seeing trailers & poster this film looked like it was going to be some-what a great one & entertaining...how wrong I was!This film was boring. I mean there were a few laughs in it from Steve Carrel, but the film as a whole, didn't cut it even in the slightest. It's a rare occasion I come across films like this. & by that, I mean films that are one sided & made for those with a technical know-how mind & not a general audience which is the main & biggest problem here. Even my friend who is a mathematician would get lost with this film just like I did it was that bad!The film lacked action (not gun blazing action) but action as in something iconic that would stand out & at least give me & the general audience something too think about! I didn't get a overview on what the film was about but the technical crap in the film itself made me very lost from start to finish. I also find it an utter joke how this got a high rating here on this site, let alone Rotten Tomatoes with an 88% rating! I've seen bad films with lower ratings that would put this film to shame! It's over-hyped & sucked balls!It's one of these films which made me want it to end every time the screen went blank for a few seconds & I also kept checking my watch over & over too. Films like this are more made for those with technical minds & would get it, it shouldn't be a film made for entertainment because it doesn't work. Hell, I've seen films which don't get distributed to my local cinema & their way more entertaining than this crap which by the way, only had about 13 odd people in the auditorium in it including me & my friend. It was just biased & got me & my mate totally lost. The film felt flat & was also part in parcel of the problem!Maybe more action & abit more uplifting drama would've saved this, but I doubt it very much considering a tsunami sized wave of technical maths, numbers & boring office scenes would've thrashed it easy!This isn't a film, it's a documentary which should be on TV which a 1 star rating. It's a boring film, nuff said! 2/10",2,4,12,28 January 2016
The Conjuring," A Sh*t Scary Film!
","I went to see this on the day it came out, on the 2nd of August & it was a pretty sh*t scary film! The sinister setting of the house was well done! The suspense really did keep you on the edge of your seat! The jump scares got you at parts you didn't expect! The special effects were pretty good! Such as with the witch, Bathsheba the accused witch who tried to kill her children to sacrifice to the devil! The theme itself was dark & creepy! The parts I thought were well done was when the sheet got blown off the line & molded into the shape of Bathsheba! The part when Carolyn gets the sheet covered over her while Ed preforms the exorcist! That was intense! When she was screaming & spewed up blood! Overall, a great sh*t scary horror film! 10/10",10,0,2,6 August 2013

","Just seen this film tonight & it was good! Very good!Gal Gadot was amazing! Damn shes a stunning gorgeous woman in this & in general! The action sequences were really good, the story enticed you in & kept you locked!The acting was pretty strong & the effects were great!Though the film dragged a bit, but it was overall a really good watch!

The Silence of the Lambs," Great Horror!
","Have seen this a couple of times & think it's a great horror film!The film follows Agent Clarice Starling, who is sent in by the FBI to investigate Buffalo Bill, a serial killer who murders & skins his victims. But to get into the mindset Clarice needs the help of another serial killer, Dr. Hannibal Lecture.I found the film to be a pretty good watch. Not overly gory, but definetly a great watch & a must watch for all fans of the horror genre. Jodie Foster & Anthony Hopkins deliver great preformances also.9/10",9,1,1,31 October 2019
Mother!," 1 F**ked up Film!
","Heard about this film & was surprised it was a remake of another with the same story-line. I was also surprised to find it was 18 rated! You never see a lot of those now...! But anyway to the film:I found the film to be something else, I'm simply speechless, yet somehow amazed by how f**ked up this film got from the first 20 minutes! It's like after the witness of the first part, you get another part which goes off the rails, then retreats back & goes off a little further & then back & then again but even, even further, so much so, it goes too out of control to even get back on the rails alone, not to mention get back to where it was at previously!The film is about a writer & his young wife, who is somewhat 10/over a decade younger than he is! He's more obsessed with himself & simply using ^ taking things, while she, is more interested in living a peaceful life away from the hustle & bustle of city life! Things quickly go from 0 - 1000 times of wtf as the husband wants more & more! The film really gets going after the 20 minute mark! We have 2 actors from 2012 best film in this one playing this couples parts: Javier Badhem from Skyfall & Jennifer Lawrence from The Hunger Games! My expectations of this film were quite far from what I read on the synopsis! I thought this to be a home invasion type horror film. But the film started off bland & a bit boring, like I was itching for something to stand out, like an obvious sign. But it got going!The film had some pretty f**ked things going on! It made the first Purge Film seem tame with the amount of violence & carnage that went on! I won't spoil it for you, but I actually quite enjoyed it! It had some raw elements going on & some pretty sad moments too! I felt for Jennifer Lawrence's character in this one! But although the film wasn't what I was expecting & I was speechless after it ended, I somewhat enjoyed the film quite a bit! I give it a 9/10.",9,3,9,19 September 2017
Creed II," Hard Hitting!
","Knew this was in the making since the 2016 original & could tell from trailers it looked epic!The film tells the story of Adonis Creed fighting against Ivan Dragos (the man who murdered his father 30 years ago) son Viktor Drago! Though he has little to sweet FA dialogue he's the infinity fighting machine of his father & as you'd expect he verses him in a fight, but it's not for the most obvious of reasons.The film was pretty solid, if not a bit long & could've been snappier in a couple of places! The fight scenes were really engaging & you actually felt for Adonis when the bones of his ribs cracked, the tension of Viktor who you were wanting to back down, but didn't! The film was solid there, but dragged in other areas! But it was over all epic & some what better than the 2016 predecessor!I won't spoil too much for you, but the film is pretty good & the ending might very well surprise you too!9/10",9,0,1,2 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Great for the fans but boring, long & confusing for the general audience.
","Jesus, where to start? This film was terrible!Now I myself Have never been a Marvel fan. I was abit half & half with a film with such a gimmicky title & well, the film was A LOT worse than I thought it was going to be! I do think these films have great effects but to be honest that doesn't make them any better & even still smothers what the heroes are meant to be about, saving lives & connecting to the real world! The main problem I've had with these films! They're simply not like the classic where the plot was simple & the effects & sci-fi crap were scarce & used sparingly! I mean is it too much to ask? Really?I even find the title of this film to be quite misleading! You only saw the 2 fighting for 5-10 minutes near the end of the film & that was it! Not that I'm one of those people who expects things to be literal to names but at least Feddy Vs. Jason was to the point of the film. This film strayed WAY to far from it's name & meaning I thought it was going to be!As with the other sh!tty films: There was no life saving. No straight forward plot which was smothered by sci-fi crap & stupid story-line & dialogue which only sad nerdy fans would get & well, the film was just a toss up of scenes which made no sense! Damn it annoyed me so much! They ALWAYS focus on sci-fi what the f*#k is that!? I mean why can't they just keep away from the sci-fi theme? Jesus These films have really gone down the sh!tter since the year 2000!I furthermore found the film dragged on & on & on & on & on & on & on....You get it right? It literally went on for what seemed like 4 hours! I mean is it REALLY necessary to have a slow 5 minute scene of Louis & Superman sharing a moment together while they are still trying to defeat the monster!? Which had took them at that point 3 quarters of a bloody hour to kill! Damn! I understand films need to be explained but to drag on scenes which are boring & have little to no action in is plain pointless! King Kong (2005) was the same took near enough a whole 1 hour until you got some action let alone 2 hours till it really kicked in! I don't get why these Marvel films feel the need to drag on so much! Just get to the damn point already!! Does killing a monster really need to take 20 minutes!? Does having a pointless clips of Louis nearly drowning for 2 minutes really need to be extended!? It seemed like it was NEVER going to end! Slow bits like Superman's funeral, again didn't need to drag on & on! It already put us general audience through enough boring torture already but just didn't end there!No! Terrible film making! Lear this!: Less is more!! Cut the sh!t!!! My arse was sore & numb when I exited the cinema! This is exactly the reason why there's such things as deleted scenes of extend cuts of the film so people who aren't fans of these films & don't want sore arse's or to be bored sh!tless can watch the get-to-the-f*#king-point version of the film on the big screen while these saddo's with no lives can watch the extended 4 hour cut of the film! Film's don't need to be long! I think even fans themselves would get bored eventually! But VERY few would do so.I even found none of the scenes made sense! Like the guys in the film were talking their own language almost! Only fans & nerds would get it & it shut out everyone else who had little no interest (general audience) right out! I just don't see why films like Superman, Batman or any other Marvel film have to be killed with sci-fi all the time? At least with the Kick- Ass films & Deadpool, they didn't over-ride with sci-fi & made it more true/realistic to life which is a hell of a lot better than this recycled, 2 hour 30 minute, 12+ sh!te which seems to be getting churned out all the time! I'd say the biggest face-palm is Superman dying! I mean really? I mean I'm no fan or expert here but isn't Superman suppose to be immortal? It's like Chuck Norris dying from a paper cut! It's just stupid & embarrassing! A terrible film! Long, Boring & a colossal waste of 2 1/2 hours I'll never get back! A film also which sad nerds with no feelings in the arse can watch as they'll only be able to get the film & forget the time elapsed as this film seemed like the never ending nightmare! Don't watch this crap!1/10",1,5,14,27 March 2016
Trainspotting," Bare Knuckle Film!
","Having heard of this film from as far back as I can remember, I had to watch this after not only my friends raving, but the sequel, T2 coming out in January next year. So Sunday, decided to watch it.A very good film I must I say! Was dark, funny, vicious, drug fuelled & one hard hitting film! Now, having not read the book myself, I enjoyed this film. Even in this day & age with films this one still seems to be a classic 90's hit as of this year 2016, 20 years on!The part near the end with the pub fight was something else! Though I was kind of expecting this film to be a bit more violent & more darker. I don't know if it was just me, but the film just didn't seem as dark or as bad as a lot of people I knew made it out to be. But it was a great watch nonetheless!I give this a 9/10 It was great & decent watch! Can't wait for T2 on the 27th January, 2017!",9,0,0,27 November 2016
Jojo Rabbit," A Great Film To Start Off 2020
","Seen a trailer for this last year & knew I had to watch.The film is about a young boy named Jojo, dressed like Hitler in the Nazi German attire & lives with his mum in a small village. One day, he finds his mum is harbouring a Jewish girl in their family attic. At first he doesn't what to do as she threatens him in a hostile manner. But as the days & weeks go on he starts to befriend her.I found the film to be quite good. It was funny, sad, dark & subtle in many ways. The satire humour was also well done & kept the perfect balance of comedy & seriousness throughout it's 1 hour & 43 minute run time. The actors & actress done well, some new blood mixed in with some actors I have seen before.Overall a good film & a great one start off the new year/decade 2020.8/10",8,4,10,3 January 2020
Live Free or Die Hard," Solid 4th Entry in the Die Hard Franchise!
","Was too young to see this in cinemas when it was released on the 4th July 2007, but now years later after finally getting to see it, I have to say it's pretty ace & action packed!John McClane and a young hacker who is nearly killed in a bomb explosion team up to take down master cyber-terrorist Thomas Gabriel in Washington D.C. Things become personal during the action packed pursuit when John daughter Lucy gets kidnapped!I found the film to action packed & epic! While a little on the generic side in terms of action it did have some epic John McClane style of action that does save & set it aside from the rest! The Cyber attacking theme added into the terrorists agenda I felt was an interesting idea & a good route to go down given the digital age we now live in!Overall a great action 4th entry in the Die Hard Franchise! 8/10",8,0,0,1 April 2020
Final Destination," Pretty Original!
",After watching Final Destination 5 I set out to buy this one & others!After watching this one I thought it was very well put together! It really gives you the best idea as to what the film & cheating death means (which I never knew before watching the franchise). Alex Browning has a premonition of a plane explosion & panics & gets off with 6 others including a teacher. Only for the incident to to place for real! Then a month goes by with the police & people growing suspicious of Alex then afterwards Death starts pursuing those who cheated their fates by manipulating the environments in deadly ways in order to kill them in the order they should die in. Alex gets accused/blamed for each death & his friends grow increasingly suspicious of him & think he has something to do with them all (including the plane explosion) & start avoiding him! The first few deaths I liked Todd Wagner's strangulation in the bathtub was well done as well as Mrs. Lewtons Kitchen death. With the kitchen knifes impaling her in the chest.The only things I didn't like were how the deaths progressed throughout the film. Such as Clears death scene how there was just no build ups to the death scene & how ridiculously it was done with the pool & the blowing winds! I would have preferred them to be like Todd's Death or even Valerie's death. Where it's takes place in a single place or room etc with objects about.But overall despite the milked exaggeration here & there it was a pretty good concept for a Teen Horror Film!7/10,7,1,1,28 December 2012
The Purge," Just Epic!!
","I wasn't bought when first seeing this film on the Odeon website. In fact I wasn't at all convinced it was going to be a great film! But I was wrong!Upon seeing trailers & previews it looked like a great film! The concept of doing what ever the hell you wanted for 12 hours! The whole 'All crime is legal!' is what caught my attention & I had to see this!Well, it was an great film! Loved the concept! Kill people over grudges/disagreements etc! It's something anyone who held so much hate for someone would do to let it out! In other words, 12 hours of stress relief! I Love it! A Stranger gets let into the house after begging for help! Which would lead the audience to think he was just pretending so he could come in & kill people! The stranger then goes away to hide while the boyfriend of the fathers daughter attempts to kill him! Then the killers outside start swarming the outside of the house, wearing creepy stereo-typical 'nice' smiling masks, while holding machetes, guns, knives, bats etc! With the polite/sinister leader giving them an hour to hand the stranger over to them or they'll come in & kill them all! They cut the power! They then wait outside making threats to the camera! Such as pretending to slice their own throats, putting the guns to their heads etc! Not to mention playing around the garden area! Women swinging on the swings! Dancing around etc! Just mental!The family try to find the stranger, so they could hand him over! But then decide against it & fight back! The heart of the film then starts with the family cautiously walking around the house, armed with guns & torches of men & women, couples & singles (all wearing the same masks) breaking in laughing & destructing the place, looking for them & ready to kill!I just liked the way the film was panned out! How the killers were just plain neighbours/normal everyday people killing! Like the women were in frilly white dresses holding machetes! How mad is that!? Couples holding hands & having piggy backs while searching for them! Just how twisted it was just made this film so interesting! Not to mention how sick minded they were! Then through the climax of the film, the masked killer get killed by unknown strangers! As well as the father, who sadly gets killed by the polite man by a machete after a great battle scene! The smug polite stranger also gets killed & is supposingly the last! Until the unknown strangers who helped decide to kill the family also as payback for rubbing the money of the home security in their faces! The stranger from the start, (who get let into the house) kills a few of them! Then they wait until morning! When the Purge finishes (after the siren sounds) & the remaining killers leave (after the women gets her head thumped repeatedly on the glass table after one last final attempt to kill the mum! Then the films ends with them standing in the door way waiting for the emergency services to arrive!Overall It was a very enjoyable film! Really liked it! Kept me on the edge of my seat! Lacked the gore & was abit dark to see! But wasn't a huge disappointment! Was well better then what I thought it would be!10/10",10,8,22,6 June 2013
Deadpool," Kick arse film!
","Not wanting to give too much away this film was absolutely epic! And second only to the Kick Ass Films which are epic!Unlike those crappy 12+ rated Marvel films this contains Sex, Drugs, Profanity & bare knuckle violence! It's Spider-Man on Steroids! The one-liners, jokes & sexual innuendo was funny as hell!The laughs in the film were great too as well as the bloody uncut violence! The actress was fit as hell too! *Bites Fist* This film truly is adult content not for under 15s, it would've been better an 18+ it was that epic!The story-line was good as well & the chop & chaining scenes were great not to mention the post end credit scene which you have got to stick around for! This film is overall an epic film you must go see & forget about the 12+ sh!t you thought was great, this is along the lines of Kick-Ass films! Bare knuckle, violence bloody, sexual & full of babes & t!ts!9/10",9,5,16,12 February 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," British, Funny, Action-Packed & Simple epic!
","Saw this 2 years ago in January 2015 but never thought to review it! But by Christ, this film is awesome! The action, the comedy, the raw bloody twisted humour in this film simply blended so well in this flick it couldn't be better! Not to mention the fact that it's British, which makes it so much better obviously! The film follows Eggsy, a young man whose father died 17 years prior when he was only 4 years old. Now unemployed & causing trouble, he finds himself joining the Kingsman to fight against evil destroying the world!The humour & bloody, violent elements you see which will remind you of that of Kick'Ass' 1-2 & Deadpool, were ace! The humour alone was simply awesome! The action sequences were epic as always & of course Samuel L Jackson's characters the villain was amazing! There were some dark parts going on in this film too!Overall, great action comedy film! 9/10",9,1,3,22 September 2017
Cube," Decent Sci-Fi Horror
","Watched this recently & thought it was pretty good. Not amazing, but pretty well done.A group of strangers wake up inside a strange cube shaped room, they have no idea how they got there or who their captor is, but realise they were all brought together for a reason. Each room is either a deadly trap from razor spikes to flamethrowers or either a safe room, all colour coordinated & coded based on the room type.I found the film to be pretty decent, not amazing but good enough. Being a slasher fan I was expecting more & felt the premise could've been taken advantage of more than what it was. Their could've been a good body count, unique deaths, gory deaths. I also felt the film was too mathematical & psychological in a lot of areas. I know it's that type of film, but to balance it out more with some action wouldn't have gone a miss.I did like the creepy feel the film had & the unique traps & deaths (of what little there was).Overall, a decent Sci-Fi Horror! 7/10",7,0,0,25 January 2020
John Wick: Chapter 2," Better than the first John Wick!
","Saw John Wick when it was released in 2015 & was impressed by the film! Though through time I forgot about it (probably have to watch again), but I do remember it being a great action film nonetheless. Now it's 2017 & we get John Wick: Chapter 2! After seeing a preview screening of this I was blown away away by the sheer amount of extreme, non-stop faced paced, gory, gun blazing action sequences this film delivered! I just loved it!The story starts with John Wick making peace with a Mafia boss which he had dealings with in the previous film, which queues the title sequence, followed on by the main story for the sequel. After John refuses a fellow client of a assignment, he gets his his blown to bits via a grenade launcher, only for John to travel to New York to inquire about what happened, he then agrees to do the assignment only to be set up by the client himself who then puts a hit out on John with nearly every hit-man getting the top pound for assassinating john with also a former arch enemy from the previous film also after him in tail for killing the clients target!I found the film to be very enjoyable from start to finish! The action sequences where truly epic & crisp, not to mention the bloody killings & brutal attacks which added to the edgy grittiness of the film! The story-line was good also & the film as a whole, to be so entertaining you were just waiting for something to happen, hell you thought if it wasn't going to end with nearly every scene being pure hard cold action from around every corner! Pure epicness!10/10 You'll love this sequel! Roll on John Wick: Chapter 3!",10,12,22,15 February 2017
Incredibles 2," Not As Good As the First, But Strong Enough!
","Saw the first Incredible when I was 10 back in 2004 & now 14 years on we get a sequel we've all been dying for! I'm now 23 going on 24 as I'm writing this & I found it to be a pretty awesome film!The action was epic! The story-line was pretty decent & the characters were pretty good too! The graphics & humourous tone also set this film up as well!Although there were things in this film which didn't seem as good or as memorable as the first. First off, the female empowering propaganda was strong smelling in this one, political correctness seems to be shoving it's way down kids young throats & it's not on. Also I felt the film dragged a bit & I also felt that them starting the film off from where it left off after well over a decade was a bit weird considering the large gap!But overall the film was quite enjoyable despite the negatives there! 8/10",8,13,23,18 July 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," Pretty good film!
","Not big on these types of war films as they're not my thing. But this one was quite good & easy to watch unlike others which are either too boring or simply lack action required to keep the audience interested!Saw this last week not long after it was released in January, it was a great film on how a young man who never broke his principles & pushed forward despite what he had against him. The story is about a young man who goes off into the army, but doesn't want to fire a weapon let alone touch one, he vows to become a paramedic during the war on the battlefield helping the those who are severely wounded & injured! He then goes even further & helps more injured soldiers! Based off true events, this film portrays what happened during the first & second World War! I found the film to be quite moving. Though it wasn't a film I'd be in a hurry to watch or even get on DVD, it was still a interesting film on the real life events which took place. The war & action scenes were done well. The blood & gore was pretty decent & the injury detail was hard hitting & raw! It really did portray the devastating effects the war has on people physiologically & psychically! It was a good watch of a film!I give this an 8/10! A must watch!",8,2,6,1 February 2017
Sully," Impressive!
","I was sort of mixed to excited about this film. Usually when it's a based-off-a-true story type I like it, but when it's directed by the likes of Clint Eastwood or Martin Scorsese you can't help but think that it's going to be overrated & more suited to older people or just a boring film that wins awards & aims to be boring in order to be great. But this film was actually really good!The film is about a pilot who lands a plane into the Hudson River in New York City after both turbine engines are destroyed when a flock full of birds fly directly into them shortly after take off on the 15th January 2009. The film then follows onto the court case Sully went through as they question why he chose to land the plane in the river & not fly back to the airport as instructed. The film goes through ups & downs but Sully succeeds in the end!Like I said, I really liked this film! It was really good & explained the story well, though it was a bit confusing at first & at some other points. I wanted to watch this film anyway as it was: A. Something new (I'm a cinema goer) & B. Because I heard good things about it, though was thinking & sort of predicting it was going to be overrated as films like this usually are. But this wasn't.I found the film to be quite good & very moving! It also locked you & kept you engrossed! I also liked the way Sully delivered the explanation of the flight simulation being invalid at the end of the film! It came out well & was exactly what I was also thinking as I was watching!It was surprisingly good & not something I'd say about a film of this calibre as I usually either write them off as overrated or crap! But this one was a pleasant surprise! And for once, I'm not being sarcastic!I overall would give this a film 9/10, it was well put together & really great watch! Go see it! It's great!",9,0,0,3 December 2016
Alien: Covenant," Sci-Fi Horror at it's best!
","Upon seeing Event Horizon just last year, I was never a Sci-Fi fan. I wouldn't say I am, even now. But when it's mixed with Horror, it makes from a pretty epic combination!Now, I never seen Prometheus in Cinemas. For the reason that it was Sci-Fi & I wasn't bought by it! But as I said above, since discovering the iconic Event Horizon Film which combines both Horror & Sci-Fi together. I've since had a change of heart, & when I found out Alien: Covenant was coming out this year in May, I decided to give it a watch! So I bought Prometheus on DVD for a cheap price to watch before going to see this one, as it was a sequel & so I wanted to watch the first film just to get a better insight for the 2nd Film.I have little knowledge of the Sci-Fi Theme alone, so I did find Prometheus & Alien: Covenant a bit confusing, not to mention beyond my know how on what they were talking about etc. But I know enough to understand whats what. So the film is set 10 years after the first. Prometheus finishing in the new year of 2094. This film starts at 2104. The colony Ship, Covenant lands on what the crew think, is an uncharted paradise! But they soon discover something far more darker & sinister going on!I found the film to be quite enjoyable! Considering the Sci-Fi Theme, the Horror elements were rife & top notch! The film was very gory & had some great action sequences & stunning visuals! The film was an improvement over Prometheus, which I thought lacked & didn't have any gore in it! This one didn't disappoint!My only complaints about he film were that it could've been better & have more bloody non-stop gory action sequences! As I really enjoyed it! Aside from finding the film a bit confusing, I found it could've been a bit better a few places & of course, cranked up to an 18 certificate! But the film was great & the aliens & graphics made up for a few of the things I mentioned.Overall, the film was really decent! I'm looking forward to more Alien Films! Sci-Fi Horror is a really great combo when done right! 8/10",8,29,55,15 May 2017
