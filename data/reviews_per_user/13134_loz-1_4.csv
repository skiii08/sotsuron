The Blair Witch Project," Scooby Doo scared me more than this!
","This film was about as scary as being tickled on the nose with a feather duster. The problem I have with 'The Blair Witch Project' is this: I have been camping on many occasions and, should you awake and find a pile of pebbles in front of your tent, you think 'Oh look. There's a pile of pebbles outside my tent', rather than screaming that you're all going to die and fumbling dramatically for a clean pair of underpants. It always amazes me that people say 'Yes, but you need to think about the implications of what might have happened'. Ok, but that's like talking about 'Mars Attacks!' and saying 'Yes, but what if some aliens really DID land and start blowing people to pieces?' - Am I missing the point here? Aaagh! No! The phone's ringing. What if it's someone masquerading as an insurance salesman but actually wants to chop off my nose with a steak knife? Help!",2,0,2,3 February 2003
Memento," One of the best films of the last 30 years!
","On a dull rainy day a couple of years ago, I was just sitting there twiddling my thumbs, so I ordered this on a Pay-Per-View channel as it looked vaguely interesting and had Guy Pearce in it - who had given such an outstanding performance in 'L.A. Confidential'. Boy did I underestimate how good this movie was going to be or what?! It is utterly compelling, has you thinking and scratching your head throughout and the ending is such a revelation that it took me about a week to scrape my jaw from off the floor. Pearce is again excellent, although Pantoliano, for me, steals the show as bent cop 'Teddy' and Carrie Ann Moss is wonderful as the playful schizophrenic Natalie. Before I watched this film I was bored and lethargic. Afterwards I felt elated and wanted to talk to everyone about it. Long may it remain in IMDB's top twenty. Impossible to give less than 10/10.",10,1,3,23 April 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Slouching Tiger, Snoozing Viewer
","I like to think that I am generally one of the most open minded viewers around, but, had 'The Fast and the Furious' not been released in 2001, I would have had no hesitation whatsoever in pronouncing CTHD the most dreary, uninteresting film of the past decade. Okay, yes I confess, I am not a lover of martial arts movies, but given the global recognition and awards picked up by the film, I was expecting the cinematic masterpiece it was cracked up to be. The movie was too slow (and I normally LIKE slow films!), the story was like 'Dallas' but with swords and sarongs instead of oil, and has sent me to sleep each and every time I have attempted to watch it. To shower this with trophies and accolades is akin to awarding Steven Seagal with a 'Best Actor' award.",7,0,1,10 January 2003
Donnie Darko," A well presented, novel idea that keeps you thinking...
","I saw this film last week, and whilst I enjoyed it very much for what it was, I wasn't entirely sure it merited its ranking as one of the 100 greatest movies of all time! However, the fact that I am STILL thinking about the picture seven days later would imply that this had a bigger effect on me than I at first imagined. Jake Gyllenhaal turns in an exceptional performance as the lead character, making the viewer feel exactly as he himself is feeling throughout the film. Add to this the sparkling inclusion (and inspired casting) of both Patrick Swayze and Drew Barrymore as sleazy self-help guru and schoolteacher respectively, as well as a breathtakingly original idea, cleverly shot and well scripted, and you will understand why 'Donnie Darko' has achieved the acclaim it deserves. So far, I have given the movie 8 out of 10, but I'm beginning to think I should be nudging it up a notch, given the lasting impression it has made on me. We'll see...",9,0,1,17 January 2003
