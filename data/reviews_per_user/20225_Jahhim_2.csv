The Blair Witch Project," Great scam
","I give this movie credit for one thing.......... It's a great scam. I can't understand what people are seeing in this movie. I love independent films, but this one right out sucked! The hype has made these people millions, and I guess I can't knock the film makers for that. I just wish it had a bit of substance to it. I sat there waiting to be scared while trying to ignore the throbbing headache I got from the horrible camera motion. Please don't give me that crap about, 'it was supposed to look like that', because I don't know about anyone else but my home movies don't shake like that. Where was all the horror I heard about? If not for the comedy relief, I would have been bored out of my mind. Where those sounds supposed to scare me? Maybe I missed something, but where were the horrifying images? Anyone can record a bunch of sounds. I've seen better horror stories on Nickelodeon's Are You Afraid Of The Dark. I get the feeling this is one of those things that people are almost intimidated into liking. They get the impression, from all the hype, that if they don't like the Blair Witch Project then they are just not cool. Sorry, my coolness is all there, but this movie could stand to find some. A-F, I give it an E for effective way to make money. Spend pennies, make millions.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
The Sixth Sense," Suspense like it should be
","Of all the so called horror/suspense movies this summer this is hands down the best! A great story, and superb acting, especially Haley Joel Osment. There is also an outstanding surprise ending, unlike another LOWER BUDGET 'horror film' that just ended abruptly with no twists nor turns.SEE THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,6 August 1999
