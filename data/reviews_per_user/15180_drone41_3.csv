Casablanca," Cult spectacle
","As a fan of cult movies, i'm starting to love the movie before watching. And if the movie is great like this, my judgment has very low criteria.What to say about Casablanca. Nothing bad, absolutely. This movie left one of the biggest mark in the history of cinematography. I just don't discuss about movies with people who didn't watch Casablanca. That movie is unavoidable.I'm so sorry that Humphrey Bogart didn't won Oscar. He has a fantastic role, and he act that absolutely genius. On the other side is Ingrid Bergman who is gorgeous and selfish women. She is very good too.The main action in movie begins like many movies, and i can bet that everyone expect that Rick will stay with Ilsa in the end. That buy me so much. Rick as a character showing us that no one can outwit him. He is one of rarely characters who listen his mind, not his heart.For the end, i must commend the director of the movie, Michael Curtiz. Fantastic story, fantastic actors, fantastic picture. Must watch everyone.",10,1,2,12 August 2015
Gone Girl," I expected more
","If you watched the movie and didn't read the book, movie is then left better impression on you. I first watched the movie, and i think it's a great, unexpected story and gave 8 to movie. But, after reading the book, i must decrease vote to 7 because book is much better than movie. I don't really like Ben Affleck, not because of his acting, it's just unlikeable to me. Maybe because of that, but i don't think that he is present good Nick Dunne as a character. On the other side is Rosamun Pike who is very beautiful women, and she is a way better than Affleck in this movie in my opinion. Movie has one nomination for Oscar, and that is for Rosamund Pike as a leading role, and she could won that if you ask me. She was great. I've felt hers emotions even that is hers lies. Story is very good, i like every unexpected part, and this movie have a lot of that things. I don't like the story of her and hers ex boyfriend, and his house in the woods. They could make something better. That parts looks like just wasting time in the movie. All in all, it's a good movie, pure 7/10 in my opinion.",7,3,4,11 August 2015
Whiplash," Brilliant
","This is one of the best movie in 2014. i've seen. The movie is unexpected,uptight and looking in one breath.Great acting by J.K.Simmons, he deservedly won Oscar. On the other side is Miles Teller who show us again how he can become a great actor if he continue to work in this way. Great reference to the story of Charlie Parker, i love that guy too. I recommend this movie for all movie maniacs like me, and others who understand what's the quality, and for music lovers. Whiplash and Caravan are wonderful compositions, love them too. That's another deservedly won Oscar. Soun mixing is awesome. If you ever dream to be the best this movie gave the great inspiration for that, and that means you can't avoid this movie. Really magnificent drama for 21st century.",9,1,2,10 August 2015
