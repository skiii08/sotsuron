First Man," An awe inspiring journey to the moon centured around Neil Armstrong as a character.
","Performances across the board are all brilliant, in particular Gosling and Foy. One scene in particular towards the end including them was one of the best in the film. The cinematography throughout the whole film is amazing, essentially being fully handheld and it worked entirely for the film especially for the space shuttle sequences. The score is also magnificent, giving off this sense of beauty and awe surrounding the space scenes in particular. The entire last third of this movie, when Neil is preparing for the moon landing, is transfixing. This entire sequence is breathtaking, from a director standpoint to a cinematography standpoint. Some of the best scenes this whole year. The conflict within NASA about the complications, dangers and precautions of the moon landing were most definitely the bright spots in the occasionally dull screenplay.'First Man' is a very slow movie, which isn't always a bad thing, but in this case I think it was a hinderance on the overall flow of the film. Moments and scenes could often be meandering, boring or a bit tedious. Much like the 2016 film 'Sully', 'First Man' feels like it is in search of movie built off one event; the moon landing, which is the entire last third. Or in Sully's case, the plane crash. Although First Man is a much better directed, acted, filmed and written film, those parallels are there. It's a film about Neil Armstrong's life leading up to the moon landing. While interesting, it never seemed to reach the emotional heights Chazelle was going for. Personally, I felt rather distant from Armstrong as a character. The emotional beats he went through, although sad, didn't help me engage with him as a person, therefore leaving the theatre disconnected from him. The emotional core is at the start of the film and is extremely sad, and is payed off at the end. Unfortunately, this emotional core didn't enhance the secluded, quiet nature of Neil as a character. This is a major flaw, because the entire film is about Neil Armstrong and his life leading up to the first step on the moon. It is a subjective thing, and will work for some and not for others. 'First Man' is directed marvellously by Chazelle. The cinematography is incredible, in particular the flying sequences which felt extremely realistic. The score is wonderful, the performances are great, and the last third is magnificent. It is at times boring, dull or tedious, but never all at once, as I was mostly intrigued by the events leading to the moon landing. Neil Armstrong as a character was distant from feeling any investment in him. 'First Man' is still, at its best, an awe-inspiring journey to the first steps on the moon.

A Quiet Place," Thrilling, gripping and tense.
","'A Quiet Place' is directed by John Krasinski and stars himself, Emily Blunt, Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe and is the story of a world ravaged by monsters who hunt by sound. Even the slightest noise could mean death. So we follow this family trying to live in absolute silence as they live their everyday lives.
 
John Krasinski shows himself to be a more than capable director, as this is his third directorial feature film. The way he conducts the camera is immaculate and the cinematography is lush and vibrant. Krasinski gives a stellar performance in this film, that is full of subtlety. Emily Blunt is just absolutely magnificent in this film, one scene in particular which could be done laughably, but she truly ensures the maximum believability and was enthralling. Millicent Simmonds as their deaf daughter, also being deaf in real life, is fantastic and truly understood her character.
 
The monsters really posed as a threat to this family, and their designs looked very outlandish. Almost all the scares in the film were extremely suspenseful, and the tension builds throughout the film to a whopper of a finale. Although, occasionally, the film can divert back to the common horror tropes of fake jump scares, but the majority of the time every tension filled scare is worth it.
 
Although horror is a large part of this film, there is an equal amount of heartwarming relations centred around family. The family dynamic glistens with love throughout the whole film, and due to trauma set up within the opening act, those complications come into play. The film is paced very consistently, having never a dull moment. It is a film that is easy to pick apart from a screenplay point of view. There are nitpicks you can have with certain things that happen, and things the family use. But if you delve to far into those unnecessary qualms, the core of the film is lost. 
 
'A Quiet Place' is as terrifyingly thrilling as it is heartwarming. Kransinski's vision is very clear, and hits home for what he his trying to achieve. There are some unnecessary nitpicks and fake unearned jump scares, but the crucial core still beams with creativity and thrills. If you're looking for that gripping horror-thriller, this will be your ticket.",8,2,3,26 April 2018
