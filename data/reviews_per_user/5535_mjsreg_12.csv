It," Too long - too boring
",After the hype this film received I was looking forward to a gripping story.All I did was fight not falling asleep as the story unwound at a painful pace. It was like watching a souped up version of the Goonies.A re-edit could easily have shortened this film by 45 minutes it was that slow.Better off spending your time watching a couple of good movies that this one.,4,0,3,3 April 2018
Passengers," Very much worth seeing.
","I am not particularly a fan of sci-fi movies, or of Jennfier Lawrence, but this film is GOOOOOOOOD!Usually when a film is hyped as much as Passengers the reality of watching it often disappoints.The cinematography and effects are good, but what made the film something special for me was the way the cast portrayed their characters in a subtly brilliant story.Nothing was overdone. The effects were appropriate for the action without overriding the core of the film.All of the actors were superb, and as I watched I was drawn into their lives, thoughts, and feelings. Perhaps being such a small cast helped then to gel together.And for the guys - take your partner to see this movie - you won't regret it.",8,4,5,1 March 2017
Green Room," Not the best - but not bad either
","i didn't have any expectations of the film and had only seen one listing and as far as I was concerned it was just something to watch when nothing was on telly.At first, it seemed to start rather slowly with a bit of a tired plot. A group of young people doing something, who then go somewhere, and something happens.As the film progressed I gradually become more involved with the plot and the characters, and in the end it wasn't a bad film to watch at all.One major problem (as other reviewers have pointed out) was the poor sound mixing. Some of the actors dialogue was almost inaudible - especially Patrick Stuart's.If you have nothing particular you want to see then this film is OK. It is not the greatest of all time but is watchable.",7,2,6,10 July 2016
"I Love You, Man"," A less that zero
","I don't know what film other reviewers were watching but I don't think it was this one!This film is AWFUL from beginning to end. It is a very slowly drawn out torturous film with an extremely boring storyline and nothing funny about it or in it whatsoever,Some of the acting is OK from the supporting cast but the main cast is just vacuous trite and unbelievable - in every way.It is so boring I really can't think of anything that is worth mentioning about the film. It looks like a made for TV factory production where even the lighting is as artificial and boring as the rest of it.",1,0,5,19 November 2017
BlacKkKlansman," It is OK but obviously bias.
","The acting is superb, and the whole cast does an excellent job, but the story leaves something to be desired.It is going to be difficult maintaining balance when making a film based on a person's subjective interpretation of events, and bias within the story and directing is evident.The 'Black Panthers' get a very cursory mention yet they were embedded in the black student movement of the 70s, and were as equally idiotic and prejudice as the Klan. Perhaps covering their involvement would have given more reasoning to the black characters motivations and views of the time.It's not a bad film, but it is far from a true reflection of race conflicts in the 70s - which is a time I remember well.",6,5,9,8 January 2019
Bird Box," Better than expected
","This is a very watchable well made film with an interesting story.I wouldn't call this a 'horror' at all, but as a sci-fi it is well worth watching.Bullock probably isn't the first name one would think of for this genre but she does a good job of playing the main character, and even the two kids put in a believable performance.It may not be a genre buster but it is certainly worth watching.",7,2,5,10 January 2019
A Quiet Place," Tedious and stupid
","I don't know how this film has such a high rating.It is nothing special by any means, and gets really tiresome after the first fifteen minute where you get to know the characters and their situation.There are so many really dumb things that happen in this movie that make no sense whatsoever, and the characters are just as dumb.Really, there are far better movies to watch than this. I wouldn't bother again that's for sure.",5,1,4,28 June 2018
Midsommar," A well written and engaging story
","This film deserves the hype.Everything about this film shows how a good film should be made. An engaging story, beautiful cinematography, brilliant acting, and real artistic thought put in to the shots. All of which pulls you in and keeps you there.Certainly one to watch - beautiful yet disturbing.",8,3,6,26 September 2019
Joker," Superb!!
","Rarely does a film exceed the hype like Joker!it always puts me off when I see rave reviews from critics about a film and really wasn't expecting this film to be as good as it turned out.The acting by Joaquin Phoenix is a masterful performance, detailing every nuance of the Arthur character.It sucks you right in to his world and keeps you there for the whole two hours or so - which went by so quickly.If you are a fan of quality film this is certainly one to watch.",9,1,1,10 January 2020
Mother!," An attempt at artistic cinema perhaps that fails
","This isn't really a horror at all, more of an attempt to make a mainstream art film.There is nothing wrong with the acting or technical aspects of the film, or even the directing. They all fall into place to provide the viewer with an experience that is good on the eye.Where this fails miserably is in the storyline - where it seems someone has taken the concept of Rosemary's Baby and tried to shoehorn it into something else - although what that something else is remains elusive ot the end.I suspect most people watched this film expecting it to live up to the hype - it doesn't.",4,1,1,24 December 2017
Jojo Rabbit," OK but not worth all the hype
","No doubt this is a charming well produced film, but at nearly 2 hours long the story becomes tedious.",6,3,5,9 March 2020
Spectre," The worst Bond film ever
","I didn't have high expectations of this film because since Mr Pathetic Wimpy Craig has been playing the part I have totally lost interest. I have seen more masculine girls scouts.But seeing as this is the last Bond film he has stated he will be in I thought he may have made one last effort at reprising the more masculine elements of Fleming's character.Nope - within the first fifteen or twenty minutes I thought I had died and was desperate for defibrillation as the screen in front of me slowly blurred into a mush of nothingness. And that sums up the whole film.They obviously spent some cash on the production - mostly on special effects, which are (surprisingly) obvious from the outset. The street scenes are so unrealistic and resemble something from a 2000 computer game that it was difficult to find any semblance of realism with which to latch on to, and become engrossed in, the story line. It was like watching a more modern poorly executed rehash of the funeral scene from Live and Let Die.The storyline was slow, the action obviously false, and the monotone pathetic ramblings of Craig made the film exceedingly unwatchable and a total waste of time for me.I would rather have watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang - at least that is well produced with an excellent interpretation of the original.IF the Bond franchise is to continue the Producers really need to get their heads out of their backsides.",1,22,44,25 February 2016
