The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Maybe Known Story
",When a watched this film I realized then this could happen to anyone of us. Typical 'drunken' teenage girl and shamefaced teenage boy who thing about her all the time.Especially party lovers and drama lovers will appreciate this movie. I thought then this story is written very well.There's a mention about psycho things what happened to Charlie. It was a little bit confusing. But after all we can see the whole story and what happened to Charlie.Getting friends between graduates can be sad... because you lose them all after one year and if you not it will be very difficult when everybody goes on the college. I've got one friend between graduates too when I was freshman. It's not easy when they move away... we will lose a lot of fun and jokes with them.This movie tells a real story which you lived through or someone of your friends. That's why I suggest you to watch it.,10,1,3,27 May 2013
