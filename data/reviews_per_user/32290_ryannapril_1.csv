Iron Man 3," Blasphemy
","Irritated. A little while back my wife and I vowed to not watch nay movie that blasphemed the Name of God. Where many movie writers and directors will not dare to tread on sensitive subject, they certainly make their stance clear when breaking this simple command. DO not take the Lord's name in vane. Not that hard. I bought this movie and just before watching it I IMDb'd it to make sure there was no blasphemy. ONE. One single GD. The editors could not take out one word that many of us Christians find intolerable. The movie is going back tomorrow. I will never watch it. I am sure it is great and fun. I will not compromise for a 2 hour kick. I cant watch Oblivian either. I love scifi movies. Tell me this writers: If scifi movies deal outside of the idea of God...then what sense does it make that a character uses the Name of God in a cuss word in your dialog??????? Sorry so serious :) Love you all",1,1,4,9 October 2013
