It," 80's throwback
","The film has as a charming 80's feel to the film, think goonies / gremlins etc. Without a doubt the first 10 minutes are the best, and the first scene with the clown was actually the best. The film dragged a bit in the second and third act, and was just spinning it's wheels. Overall a solid film, but room for improvement.",9,1,4,6 November 2017
