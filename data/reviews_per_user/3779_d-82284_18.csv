Despicable Me 2," It Bring a lot of joy.
","The feeling after watching is that the minions have significantly increased their role, and there are many new images. The creator may have spent too much thought on the minions, and I feel that other characters have been left out. , The little yellow man is the biggest cute point. The protagonist's love story is a bit old-fashioned, but it's not a romance in itself. I also like the minions and cute things, but I didn't like them very much, so I sat in the movie theater for more than half an hour without seeing any progress in the plot.",9,0,1,17 March 2020

Madagascar," Love
","Some people like to watch serious and thought-provoking works, while others like to easily deviate from the actual small categories of life. When you are overwhelmed by the heavy work, watching such a movie is actually good.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Every generation has a legend.
","As a Star Wars fan, although I do n't see the full story trilogy and prequel trilogy on the big screen, I am very lucky to have witnessed the posttrilogy trilogy on the big screen. After the show was over, it was still exciting, a legend ended, and a new adventure was about to begin. At the end of the movie is the double sunset of the planet Tutain. Mida is sighing.

Wreck-It Ralph," This film is more suitable for people who love nostalgic games.
","The plot is simple. The moving and funny advantages of general animated films have not been shown. The last point is to destroy the friendship of Wang who sacrifices himself for his friends, saying 'be the bad guy. Touching, this movie is very loving, very easy, and quite enjoyed. After returning home, I also found this game to play, which reminds me of many previous games and childhood! !! !!",8,0,0,21 March 2020
Frozen," Brave

What is important is that we accept ourselves, no matter what we are, even if we do n't like it, we must accept ourselves, because only when we accept ourselves can we change. possible.When we sit down, when we are alone, when we talk to ourselves, when we analyze ourselves, we become friends with ourselves.

Brave," This is still my favorite Pixar animation, no matter what other people think.
","In the TOUCH THE SKY song in the title, I don't know why I can't help crying.

The Dark Knight," In front of The dark knight, all superhero movies are so superficial and dwarfed.
","The clown in The dark knight is actually an extreme of elitism, that is to say, the clown is a wise saint who sees everything, but unlike the past, he turned to the dark side, and in his opinion which direction No one side is important. It is important to publicize your elitism spirit and complete your great social humanity experiment to prove his point: madness is just like gravity. He believes that the various orderly systems established by humans relying on their so-called rationality are themselves a big joke. As long as he easily arouses the madness of human nature and inspires him, the system can immediately collapse and disintegrate.

Inception," I found that many people superficially underestimated the value of this movie.
","Many people like to analyze from the technical level, but often fail to notice that the core content of the movie is really emotional. As the director himself said, 'The commonality of action movies is to deliberately treat the emotional lines superficially,' but 'Pirates of Dreams' is a movie that relies heavily on the meaning of the film. It is about dreams and memories Thing, so I decided to aggravate the emotional part. '",9,0,1,16 April 2020

Shrek," Love
","This film not only absorbs the classic mode of Disney, but also makes a huge goodwill joke with this mode. In the past, Disney's films can be summarized as the law of 'the prince rescues the fallen princess, the two fall in love at first sight, and finally grow old.' Needless to say, the prince and the princess are kind, but the most important thing is the appearance of Lang Jun. However, most people in the world are plain and have neither a star face nor an athlete figure. Do they only match Cinderella's sister or stepmother? The film has achieved great achievements in shaping characters with sound, especially the donkey voiced by Eddie Murphy. In addition, computer technology has also made breakthroughs, making vision real.",8,0,0,30 March 2020
The Godfather," Impressed deeply
