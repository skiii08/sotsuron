The Blair Witch Project," Deserves its success
","I think it's the snuff film aspect of the exercise that's most captivating - the psychological verisimilitude inherent in the working method, coupled with the knowledge (from the opening caption) that there will be no happy ending, marks it as a morbidly voyeuristic exercise - but with a contemporariness that lends itself to a bandwagon and to mainstream respectability. The characterizations are well-judged, with the initial hubris of Heather's leadership providing the perfect springboard for the tensions that explode as their situation worsens - I didn't detect many false notes in it. It pushes all the buttons while remaining open to ambiguity and alternative interpretations, and on the whole seems to me to deserve its success for its fresh but respectful approach to the genre.",8,1,1,3 August 1999
Casablanca," Undoubtedly the happiest of accidents, which doesn't make it any less admirable
","Undoubtedly the happiest of accidents, which doesn't make it any less admirable - the movie has a perfect note of romantic fatalism, a wonderful balance of comedy and drama, and a staggering array of memorable lines and incidents: however often you've seen them or heard them quoted, the moments when the screen settles into one of those legendary bits have a privileged electricity about them. The film is highly dependent on its players - apart from Rains, none of the support really has  ample time to sketch much of anything in depth, but they	re all such strong, persuasive types that the movie feels like an extraordinarily deep canvas. Compared to some other movies, Bogart's hard edge is too much a pose, too obviously ready to be wiped away; and although the movie draws strength from its almost mythic location, it's also a way of reducing the actual political elements to the point of near-abstraction - the elements of personal morality flourish here, but then they have an unnatural advantage. None of this matters very much. The movie has such huge emotional depth, representing such an enormous array of incident, that it's a triumph of economy at 100 minutes or so. Bogart is at the absolute peak of anyone's form here - there's no strained sentiment, no apparent grasping for charismatic distance or charm - he's the peak of moral self-definition interacting with a complex world on its own terms.",9,0,0,8 September 1999
The Birth of a Nation," Half enjoyable in a rickety old-fasioned way; half chillingly offensive
","The movie's first half is enjoyable as a straightforward reconstruction - with the intertitles occasionally quaintly citing the source material underlying the recreations - the mushy family stories and strenuous historical tableaux don't really mesh, but it rattles along well enough. In the second half, it takes on an offensiveness that mere changing times can't excuse. The titles refer approvingly  to the KKK as quelling the force of negro anarchy; the movie consistently seeks out degrading  images of blacks - the grotesquely posturing mulatto;the blacks drinking and taking their shoes off in the legislature; the black who harasses the young woman into jumping off a cliff to her death; the scheming lieutenant governor...and on and on - contrasted with the piousness of the prevailing tone and the ludicrous would-be stirring patriotic aspect of the project, it adds up to a chilling spectacle. Students of early film could no doubt point out the things this film did before any others, but that aside the staging is mainly static and ponderous; the most distinctive images are also the most dated. It's most intriguing when capable of being viewed as a pure curio - as with the assassination of Lincoln or the surrender of Lee, dramatized like some rickety local theater costume party.",6,4,9,9 September 1999
Elizabeth," Well-acted and colorfully, vibrantly told
","The movie presents her climactic stylization of herself(virtually severing her link with her own human self and becoming pure symbol, embodiment of the state, leader to her people) partly as a visceral reaction to her frustration at her missteps and partly as a shrewd calculation, and it's the relationship between the two that's most fascinating - the film manages to grapple with the complexity of her psychology and her situation quite elegantly and certainly entertainingly. Against that, the details of how events actually unfolded aren't as well presented - the movie consists largely of encounters within palace walls or between twos and threes - there's a constant slew of intelligence and things found out, but it gets to be almost abstract intrigue, with the talk of conspiracy and motivations and suchlike sounding like a bit of a macguffin. The whirl of plotting men renders Elizabeth's actions as isolated high spots and inspired moments of sound judgment rather than necessarily consistent leadership, but it's hard to tell how much that's a deliberate narrative strategy. The film is nevertheless well acted and colorfully, vibrantly told - forged in powerful, bold sympathetic instincts.",Null,0,0,31 August 1999
He Got Game," The movie's flaws may stick in the mind more than its strengths
","The movie's flaws may stick in the mind more than its considerable strengths: Lee's superb orchestration of the pressures that attend the acknowledged rising star - driven home with shining cars and watches and almost comically available big-breasted women and unexplained bundles of money; the coach, the girlfriend, the uncle are all on the take. The cumulative impact is powerful even if you're not sure about some of the details. But the main plotline with Washington is pretty familiar and doesn't amount to much whichever character you concentrate on - we've all seen such familial pressures/strife played out at the intersection of sports and tough love before. The subplot of Washington finding genuine tenderness with hooker Jovovich is pretty useless too. Lee's montages are wonderful but the Aaron Copland music may actually be TOO stirring and much of the film resembles nothing as much as image ads for the NBA. Generally engrossing but overall too long.",7,1,3,7 July 1999
American History X," Wildly variable quality, but fascinating and gripping
","Suggests the devil has the best tunes: the portrayal of Norton's immersion in the movement is scintillating, conveying both the visceral excitement and his fearsome articulacy and the sexy physicality it gives him - the scene where the dinner-table discussion of Rodney King grows into a brutal attack on Gould is painful to watch. At such times the sleek, visually punchy style draws you right in and is all the more mesmerizing for the repulsive nature of the identification.  But the movie has way more problems with the other side of the argument. The prison scenes are reasonable enough, if too reliant on a single amiable black guy as a positive influence on Norton, but Furlong's personal journey makes far less sense - the performance is blank and he doesn't have half the space to explain or demonstrate himself. The closing stretches are messy and disappointing. The social fabric of racism is barely touched on (easily the worst scene is the clunky flashback to the racist dad) and the movie's 'anti' argument consists mainly of assertions about  racists being sad, time-wasting assholes. Despite this wildly variable quality, it was one of the more fascinating and gripping movies of its year.",7,0,0,1 September 1999
Lawrence of Arabia," Still a film of substantial impact
","The film's cumulative impact is substantial. Sometimes it still feels extremely modern - like the famous cut from the match to the red sky, or in the detailed study of Lawrence's psychological disintegration, or just in the vivid depiction of the moments of darkness and brooding at the heart of his grand achievement. Then at other times it tends to descend into men talking in rooms or to the over-mannered portrayals of the likes of Guinness, although the theme of the young impetuous leader contrasted with the weighty cynical calculations of the true ruling class is powerful. O'Toole provides a subtle, bravura picture of Lawrence as a man tormented by his own desire for achievement and grandstanding, yet barely able to bear his weaknesses and fears and also increasingly haunted by very real and    dark demons. The movie is of course a visual splendor and a great feat of coordination and assembly - every scene is constructed like a paining or a great tableau, sometimes other-worldly ghostly or strange, sometimes sheerly magnificent, always attuned to the grand contrast between the messy culture of the Arabs and the clipped, calculating British - a line that Lean himself walked quite eloquently and fluidly in this film. It sometimes strikes me as lying too much on the side of hero-worship, but no matter.",Null,0,0,10 September 1999
Once Upon a Time in America," Often dazzling symphony of memory
","The movie is at its most dazzling when orchestrating space and time into a symphony of memory and emotion - it has such panache that you rather lose your rationality, so that even the playing of a distinctly corny version of 	Yesterday	 on the first appearance of the aged De Niro seems poignant. In its middle section, the movie settles into a more conventional telling of a gangster melodrama, with a central plot that considering the time involved in the telling may seem a little thin - just the conventional trajectory of young hoods thrown into the big time and then coming to a bad end; the ending allows broader allusions, but they're a little odd and obscure. The characterizations aren't the show here - it's the finesse with which Leone manages to make every scene seem noble and weighty - especially when he's sketching across the passage of years. The movie's strengths and weaknesses are encapsulated in its treatment of women - narrative tools, but thriving amid the ventilating grandeur of Leone's ambition; McGovern (ridiculously but resonantly unchanged after 30 years) is not just a continuing object of desire but also a symbol of his past weakness and folly.",8,0,2,3 September 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," An old man's film
","The movie, scene by scene, is often embarrassing, with blandly functional, declamatory dialogue delivered slowly, oh so slowly; the performances are exactly what you'd expect if multiple takes had squeezed the life and the will out of the actors. It's mostly shapeless, especially when Cruise seems to revisit every earlier scene in the movie to little effect; the movie is awash in a softcore art-movie cliched view of nudity; the ritualistic sex is mostly ludicrous and the climax...well, it s not much of a payoff. It s not that I can t see the things people cite as proof of the film s greatness - it s just hard to value them that highly. Certainly, there s an occasionally hypnotic ritualistic air, a feeling of heightened unreality in which the boundary between dreams and reality is untrustworthy - the movie periodically quivers under its severe vision of the weakness of the flesh; the privileged lushness of the settings heightens the fragility and shock of subversion. These undercurrents are interesting, but not enough to make the thing predominantly enjoyable. It's an old man's film; out of touch with the raw material of life (and perhaps even of dreams).",4,1,2,19 July 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Sweet but minor
","A sweet but minor compendium of fictionalized showbiz chestnuts, with Sean Penn playing a jazz guitarist who - despite drinking and womanizing and general unreliability - enjoys a brief 20's and 30's heyday before fading out of sight. The film keeps a brisk pace, and although Penn's artfully stylized performance could have supported a more probing portrayal, that's not on the agenda: the illustrations of his neurosis are largely played for comedy (of the wistful smile rather than the laugh-out-loud kind). In its zippiness and general inconsequentiality and fake documentary trappings the film sometimes reaches all the way back to Allen's debut, Take The Money And Run. It keeps emphasizing the unreliability of its own portrayal, stressing how the legend may have overtaken the facts, but it doesn't really matter - the film apparently aspires little to art or satire, and achieves its goal of mellow raconteurship.",7,1,1,20 September 1999
The Sixth Sense," Surprisingly coherent, effective movie
","The ending was a real surprise to me anyway, and to my mind involves far less cheating than many final twists of this type; even thematically, it's fairly consistent with the movie's surprisingly consistent tone of troubled concentration. The performances all contribute ably to this atmosphere of quivering melancholy; certainly the dialogue is heavy-handed at times, and although the contrast of the kid's visions and Willis'	 personal pain is valid in thematic terms and broadly successful as melodrama, it also lends itself to a lot of portentous soul-searching and wallowing (which admittedly looks better when you think back on the thing with the hindsight of knowing where it's going). The movie marshals its shock effects wisely and for maximum impact, and in the post-funeral scene among others achieves an almost Blair Witch-like sense of unbearable apprehension, imminent trauma and desire to run out of the theater. Still, its commercial calculations make it ultimately less interesting than that film.",8,0,0,16 August 1999
Cube," Philosophy-friendly suspense yarn
","The movie has the taste not to overplay the potentially facile philosophical implications of its premise - a diverse group, in a stripped-down environment the origin of which they have no knowledge, finding that they each have a particular skill relevant to effecting their escape...if they can conquer their differences. Through generally unforced writing, canny acting, and surprisingly striking production design given the very low budget, the movie makes it as a suspense yarn. The limited possibilities of its premise start to become more obvious as it goes on, and it lacks the wild idiosyncrasy and fluency of something like Pi. But it's no surprise that it's reportedly been a big hit in France - it lends itself very effectively to a high-school essay-level of philosophizing; and it's no doubt canny (if dramatically a bit of a letdown) that the movie refrains from showing us what's outside the cube (except, as per one memorable exchange, human stupidity).",6,0,0,14 July 1999
