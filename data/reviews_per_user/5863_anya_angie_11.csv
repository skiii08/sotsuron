Casablanca," A kiss is still a kiss... a sigh may be just a sigh, but MUSIC MAKES THIS FILM A FILM THAT WILL LIVE IN INFAMY
","For a film that is so highly spoken of I never really was too eager to see it. I suppose it's because of what some would term as 'hype' others would term as 'overkill.' But some would term it as 'tribute.' Anyway, I didn't feel like it was a must-see. I THOUGHT I knew the story. I didn't. I THOUGHT I knew the lines, I did, I THOUGHT I knew the music, and I did, but only when I see this movie over and over do I begin to appreciate Bergman's acting, Bogie's finesse, and Steiner's music. Ever since I saw 'Carrotblanca,' I remembered that I should really try to see this one. So at the first opportunity, I bought it, watched it that very night, and unlike Doctor Zhivago, this one actually kept me entertained and sympathized with the characters. It's an amazing story, I'm surprised people have actually thought this was a boring film... though for action-loving dudes on motorcycles in leather and gold chains might find it so.NO ONE PLAYS IT LIKE SAM!

Minority Report," A review of Tom's acting, and then the rest of the aspects
","Acting-wise, at least in most of his films (Interview With The Vampire, Vanilla Sky, A Few Good Men, and Magnolia are exceptions) he has just been pretending to act like he's in a school play. Vanilla Sky changed my mind about him, not because of the confusing storyline, but because of his amazing acting ability in that. I guess that was just a fluke considering I have seen nothing, acting-wise, to top that performance (Cruise-wise).But on to the actual movie. This movie's first hour I imagine was to establish premise and characterization. But it doesn't do a good job at either. But the rest of it was absolutely amazing, and spellbinding, mesmerizing, but because of Cruise's poor acting I wouldn't term it as a masterpiece. Effects, cinematography, directing, screenplay, all should be remembered come Oscar time.7/10 for the long period of nothingness and Cruise's bad acting.",Null,0,0,31 July 2002
Training Day," I loved it, but it's hard to watch because of the offensive language
","I know that's just part of the realistic atmosphere but still, there was a lot of cursing in there, and I wouldn't let anyone overly religious or conservative watch it, or anyone under the age of 20 and over 50. It is extremely realistic, violent, offensive, and extremely amazing, because of the story, and directing, and Denzel's masterful performance. It's not the thing I usually like, but I saw it and love it still.",Null,0,11,14 October 2002
Sleepy Hollow," Burton is magnificent, as is Depp... BUT GIVE ELFMAN HIS CREDIT TOO!!!!
","This is a real masterpiece, and like any masterpiece it would not be the same with a frightening score. Sure, it resembles The Frighteners and Batman, and perhaps a bit of Edward Scissorhands, but James Horner copied Braveheart in Titanic. This score is amazing, in addition to the landscape and scenes, and story elements. I can't imagine any other way to tell this story and make it scary. I was never frightened of the actual Irving tale, I thought it was stupid. But when I saw this, it was wonderful. The more I watch it the better it is. Burton is amazing. Depp was fantastic, but better in The Ninth Gate, the acting was good, and the story was fantastic despite the dialogue/script, but give Elfman some credit, every masterpiece has a masterful score, and this one is it.",Null,0,0,14 October 2002
Lilo & Stitch," Something for Walt to be proud of, finally
","I like every Disney film I've seen but of course the new classics, The Lion King, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid have gotten a tiny bit of bad press, and I don't think they're the way Walt would have done them.This one takes the taco. It's not necessarily better than the three I mentioned, and definitely not better than the ones Walt made, but this one is definitely the one that would have made Walt proudest (except Beauty and the Beast, which I'm sure he was looking down and proud of). I can not think of a time when I did not like any part of this movie. In fact I cried when I saw this with my 11 year old niece, who loved this far more than I did, which is funny cause we don't usually agree on animated films.One thing I rolled my eyes about was the overkill of pop songs, though the Elvis ones did have relavance to characterization at least. *shrugs* I still prefer score over pop. At least the score was better than Menken's atrocity he calls score (though Hercules is an exception), but I would rather James Newton Howard bring the same score magic he brought to Atlantis and Dinosaur, here. But Silverstn did a better job than expected.In terms of the movie, plot and characters, just check the other reviews, they say it all!",Null,1,1,30 July 2002
Doctor Zhivago," I can't recommend this movie to any of my friends, and that's a first.
","Perhaps seeing this a second time in its entirety would help me understand what everyone sees in this 'historical' epic.The first time I watched this, I couldn't believe that I wasn't liking it. I stopped it shortly into the second part and it took me forever to be bored enough to finish it. When it ended, my jaw dropped, and the first thing out of my mouth was 'That was stupid!' For such a complex and layered story, I wondered just what was it I didn't understand. Perhaps it was because I wasn't paying attention for the first part and so on. I'll have to watch it again before I can give it a full critique.Like Casablanca, I thought I knew the story, and didn't. It was terrible, unlike the former. I thought I knew the music, and I did, but when I heard the main theme I wanted to mute the sound, for some reason.Why do people think this is history? It's like Pearl Harbor and Titanic: fictional love story set in a real life event. For a love story mixed with revolution, read Les Miserables, or perhaps read Pasternak. For those who are into the Russian Revolution as I am, I recommend Rasputin, or read Nicholas and Alexandra; don't waste your time poisoning your mind with the movie. My advice on this one is see it at your own risk. I don't know what everyone sees in it... yet! But perhaps after a second viewing I'll be able to critique it more.",Null,3,6,25 October 2002
Spider-Man," Wonderful, but Kirsten should go back to Interview
","I was never a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, but I did love her performance in Interview With The Vampire. That catapulted her from nobody to somebody, She was MTV's Best Breakthrough Performance, why couldn't she have done the same job here, acting wise?I loved this movie, and everyone I watched it with also loved it, my bro who read the comics as a kid loved it. He couldn't stop talking about how awesome it was.Danny Elfman's score could have been better, but it could have been worse too. It should have been something like a cross between Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and Batman. Oh well, it's still a pretty good one.Some trivia for the reviewers. Spiderman was completed BEFORE 9/11. BUT the ending had to be reshot, because it ended with the bad guy getting caught in a web BETWEEN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS. I found the Goblin's attack on NYC chilling, and realistic, as it should have been I suppose. After all, what makes a good villain? Evil plan, evil deeds, evil laughter evil voice. A villain has a commanding presence on the screen, or wherever you encounter one. He/she makes you hate him/her, fear him/her, wish he/she were dead in a terrible way.Being an aspiring writer, I can say that it could have been better written, I found for example Tobey's ranting about how great Kirsten was when her eyes, blah blah blah, very dull, partially because he wasn't acting very well, and partly because writing-wise it was ranting.Overall though, it is the best comic book movie I've ever seen, some of the shots did make it look like it was indeed from the comic. Loved it, can't wait for the sequel(s).8/10drawbacks: Kirsten should take lessons from Brad again. Elfman should go back to what he really did best, the writers should take some classes. Also, some may find (understandably) that the attacks by the Goblin a little too close to home, though my brother was fairly close to the crash in Somerset and he didn't seem bothered by that part in the movie.pros: awesome special effects, great acting from Dafoe and Maguire, wonderful direction and cinematography, little swearing (when taking a kid to see a movie, or even an old person, this is important to me, to be able to tell a great story with as little cursing as possible), and a great moral.",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
Pearl Harbor," Good history, but lacks atmosphere before the attack; something is missing... could it be the music? (spoilers of a Boy Meets World episode)
","Not that I loath Zimmer's score, I think it was masterful and beautiful, but for a story so similar to Titanic, wouldn't he have thought up some way to really compete with it? The song is nice but doesn't play orchestrally throughout the movie like Titanic, I suppose that's cause he didn't write it.I like this movie, but only the parts minus the love story.When I saw this, I wasn't expecting a Titanic ripoff. I was expecting something TRUE. I saw this very same thing (sort of) in a time travel episode of BOY MEETS WORLD. Cory goes off to the war, makes his best friend Shawn promise if he doesn't come back to marry Topanga, then he comes back from the dead so to speak, interrupting the wedding.For an actor of Cuba's status I was surprised his character wasn't developed more. All that time they spent showing the closeness between the three fictional characters they could have spent on REAL people in Pearl Harbor before the attack, much like Cameron did in Titanic. See my review on that for more insight.When my mom and stepfather got home from seeing this, I said, 'Too bad it wasn't true,' and my mom and stepfather were so misled by the love story they couldn't believe it was fiction. The same went for my sister and her husband, and even my brother who is an expert at war movies, ESPECIALLY WWII, was duped, and his girlfriend. What's hilarious is that I am the youngest out of all of them and I knew it was too soapy-Titanic-like to be true.I don't care for war movies, so I can't really recommend an alternative one to seeing this, but I can advise, SEE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK. IF HISTORY IS WHAT YOU WANT, JUST WATCH THE ATTACK-THE END. Or perhaps check out some documentaries, or if you are into anything about America's involvement in WWII, watch BAND OF BROTHERS, excellent miniseries from HBO.It's really a shame that they couldn't find ANYTHING AT ALL that would make the audience 'care' for the real people in this event that they had to create FICTIONAL characters instead. Is this what historical filmmaking has been reduced to? Or were they just aching for a hit like Titanic?",Null,0,1,25 October 2002
Titanic," Sacrifices characterization for atmosphere. Emotionally involving, visually accurate, and pleasing to the ears. You experience what they (whichever character you sympathize with most) experience. It's powerf
","It's 'in' to hate this movie for some reason. But I for one have this in my top ten favorite films list. This would be about 9. Here's why.It's fiction, but everything that happens around the fictional characters is real. Ah, well almost everything. Either fact or legend. A lot of the characters we only catch a glimpse of for one moment are inspired from real photographs and such. It takes a terrible tragedy and makes you care about it, because of the fictional characters, they put you in an atmosphere of what things were like. How they missed this in Pearl Harbor I have no clue. Perhaps they were too busy trying to dupe people into thinking they were real people and not bothering to show what things were like before tragedy struck.The music in this movie is spoken for, many times in many ways. But it's not just the main theme that is worth talking about; how about when the ship is sinking? And the other various moments in the movie? I've never been scared because of music before but this really scared me during the sinking, in addition to the sights. You know a film is a masterpiece when the theme music is famous worldwide. Think about it: Casablanca, Romeo and Juliet, Psycho, Jaws, Schindler's List, Star Wars, all of these have their notorious themes, and Titanic is no exception.In conclusion,I recommend this movie to everyone!",Null,2,3,25 October 2002
Signs," Don't expect 6th Sense in terms of comprehension, but something remarkably close in terms of feeling
","For the record, the movie was great. Not as good as 6th Sense, but definitely close to Unbreakable, if not above it.No spoilers.Night has been known now for his ability to create great movies while making great points for discussion (what, you think 6th Sense did not have a purpose?). He is a true writer and intellectual, and THEN a moviemaker. A true writer makes us THINK and DEBATE, and WONDER, and FANTASIZE, and DREAM, about what things would be like IF this happened, IF this were true, IF things went this way instead of that. He's a lot smarter than most people I know (for the record I don't know Night).The world could be a very interesting place if there were more people who thought like Night and chose to get their thoughts out.The spiritual message that every review I've read has talked about, I'm not quite sure how to comment. I think it's meant to have us analyze and debate and talk about, long after we leave the theater.",Null,0,1,5 August 2002
Pocahontas," The inaccuracy is a con, the astounding animation, music, and voices are all pros to see this movie
","Every other reviewer practically has talked about the historical inaccuracies in the film, so I'm going to spare the readers from that.It's not a film intended to be for a research history project, it's meant to be a tale of the spirit of who she was. I watched this for the first time in years today, and I analyzed the animation and music for the first time in ages, and realized how superior those things are in this film. When you compare it to other animated films, this one, along with Sleeping Beauty, looks real.I loved Menken's songs always, but despised most of his scores, particularly Aladdin. This is filled with beautiful drums and trumpets and strings. 'Can you paint with all the colors of the wind?' is reminiscent when I think, can you see the images of the movie with just the score, and yes you can. This, as well as Beauty and the Beast and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are his crowning achievements as a score composer.Sure, it's inaccurate, but so is Anastasia. If you liked that one, you'll like this one. Even if you're like me and have mixed feelings about it, you should give Pocahontas a chance.",Null,0,1,16 October 2002
