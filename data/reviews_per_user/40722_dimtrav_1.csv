Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Worst film on this planet
","I could not imagine a less creative and more offensive film than this. I saw this as the front end of a film double feature and I almost walked out of the theater and missed the other feature. Fortunately I didn't but not because of Borat.A sleazy version of Moscow on the Hudson this film offers nothing worth the time or the admission cost. If people actually like this film then I have lost any respect I might have had for them. If you think that maybe I didn't like it then you're only half right, it was worse.Borat is so unfunny I would take Andy Kaufman's Latka any day in favor of Borat. Both strain the brain with their deliberate illiteracy. Andy Kaufman at least had some heart to his madness, Sacha Cohen has none.",1,13,26,11 January 2007
