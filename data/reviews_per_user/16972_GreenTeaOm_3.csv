Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Hilarious
","This is a very funny movie. The humor is primarily slapstick and physical humor, although the use of language is also comical.However, there is vulgarity, frontal nudity, and grossness, so if these things offend you avoid this movie. The main character (played by a Jewish actor) is anti-Semitic and homophobic, so again, if this kind of thing bothers you stay away. But it's all in the name of fun. This is equal-opportunity silliness. The movie pokes fun of everything and everyone--no one is immune: Kazhakstanis, evangelical Christians, TV anchors, homeboys, drag queens, animal rights people, New Yorkers, Southerners, rodeo people, frat boys, feminists, etc. etc. The cast is wonderful, especially Sacha Baron Cohen and Ken Davitian.Good to see if you need a belly laugh.",8,1,6,11 November 2006
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A masterpiece.
","Wonderful film.  Breathtaking martial arts scenes, gorgeous cinematography, wonderful sets and costumes.   Poignant double love story. The cast is beautiful to see, and the acting is marvelous.  Also this movie works on multiple levels.  It's a reflection on the nature of spirituality, intergrity, and karma as well as an action film. And yes, I liked that the women did a lot of the fighting, and that they were not just beautiful looking, but also strong and capable.  Why don't American movies have more of these kinds of roles for women? I'm not surprised that this didn't win the Oscar for best film. It's too unusual and off-the-beaten path for American tastes. Oscar likes movies that are predictable--and this was anything but.",10,0,0,26 March 2001
Mystic River," Marvelous acting and cinematography, otherwise unremarkable
","I wasn't crazy about this movie, for reasons I can't entirely verbalize.  Maybe it's because the subject matter and resolution are sordid and not in the least uplifting.  However, the film is worth seeing just for the acting.  The entire cast is amazing, with standout performances by Penn, Robbins, Bacon, and, especially, Marcia Gay Harden.  Also, the cinematography is quite striking.",8,0,0,1 February 2004
