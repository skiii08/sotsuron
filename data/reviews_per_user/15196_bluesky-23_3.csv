Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Surprisingly wonderful
","First of all, let's make one thing clear: I have never been a Tarantino fan and have never seen his other movies. They never appealed to me one iota. Yet the trailers for Kill Bill so intrigued me I finally had to watch Kill Bill, Vol. 1. I liked some of it, I started to understand why he is critically adored, but as a whole, it really wasn't outstanding. KB1 was fun to watch, but sometimes over-the top and lacking in coherence and plot. I watched KB2 simply to see how it ended but without high expectations. I was blown away.From the black-and-white beginning where Uma addresses the camera to the final shot as the credits roll, there are so many brilliant moments I can't even list them all. The flashbacks to the wedding chapel and her conversation with Bill completely draw you into the characters and (which KB1 never did) make you care about what happens to them. The scenes in the coffin are so claustrophobic you feel trapped yourself, and the moment when her hand bursts out of the dirt is so terrific it induces cheering. Walking into the diner covered in dirt and politely asking for a glass of water is another great moment, reminiscent of the gunslinger walking into a bar. There are other wonderful Western homages and Western-style music which are incredibly cool as well. There are of course great action sequences with Pai Mei and Daryl Hannah and cringe moments (the snake and the eyeball) but thankfully, no ludicrous blood spurting as in Vol. 1. (There are also very funny moments as well, in particular the reaction of Daryl Hannah to the tobacco spit - a totally girl moment and absolutely hilarious.) But the genius of Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is in the dialogue between Bill and the Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo we discover), and in the wonderful scenes with their daughter (such as: playing with toy guns; David Carradine making sandwiches, butcher knife in hand; tucking her daughter in bed for the first time; the superhero discussion... all moments to savor).Ultimately, KB2 is an amazing tribute to motherhood and what makes us women. Even such a cold-blooded killer as Beatrix changes her entire life and does anything to save her child once she learns she is pregnant. The credits say it all: the shot of Uma smiling at her daughter, driving away, and AKA: Mommy as the last line - a defining part of her character from this point onward. She isn't just a killer, as Bill implied, who can never lead a normal life; she can be something more. It's a shame that a lot of women will see this as a guy's movie and not be drawn to it; as a woman, I loved the movie even more for the development of Uma's character and her stunning performance. And I have far more respect and admiration for Tarantino as a filmmaker than I ever did before. If you think this movie isn't exactly your cup of tea, try it anyway (if you have a tolerance for the action sequences) - you might be delightfully surprised.",9,6,13,9 February 2005
Finding Neverland," A beautiful Neverland
","Finding Neverland is exquisite in its simplicity. It is never overdone or melodramatic; instead, its gentleness, subtlety, and depth of character make it moving. It moves back and forth between real life and a fantasy world, illustrating the link between inspiration and imagination in the creation of the beloved play Peter Pan. Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet give strong performances with genuine emotion, yet the most outstanding performance of the movie belongs to Freddie Highmore (Peter). It is ultimately Peter who carries the movie's heart and soul, especially in the climatic scenes. I defy anyone to watch this movie without feeling a lump in the throat or shedding a tear. Finding Neverland deserves to be awarded Best Picture of 2004.",9,5,6,7 February 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," For once, a fantastic movie that surpasses the excellent book
","I was first introduced to the Lord of the Rings in high school. I read through the entire trilogy and loved it so much I immediately read it through again, back to back. Whenever I love a book (and am very familiar with it), I tend not to fall in love with the movie. I think, 'that was a pretty good adaptation,' or I dislike certain elements of it, or I don't like it at all.Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh, and Philippa Boyens changed all that. For the first time I love the movies even more, if that's possible since the books are the original, than the books. It was a love which grew over time and multiple viewings, that finally caused me to realize that here was something I never tired of. Not ever. I could buy extended versions of the movies, listen to hours of commentary, watch hours of behind-the-scene footage, and never be bored.Why? First of all, the casting in the movies is exceptional. I would not change one of the actors if I could. They will forever define the characters for me; they fill the roles and work together in a way that no one else could. It is a shame there is no Oscar for Best Ensemble Cast; if ever a cast deserved it, this one did. But the key to the success of these movies is their emotional heart and soul. Peter Jackson understood this (see Heavenly Creatures) and took the spirit of the books, rather than the literal letter, and made it work on film. The brilliance of the writing and direction on this gargantuan project cannot be underestimated. To the book purists: write a screenplay, pick up a camera, and do a better job yourself. I cannot imagine how it could have been done better. In fact, in many places, Jackson and co. improve upon the original by streamlining it, simplifying it, and making the whole story more logical. Finally, Howard Shore's beautiful soundtrack is so emotional, evocative, and memorable that the movie without it is unimaginable. My favorite movie (all three together) of all time. What more can I say?",10,2,4,10 February 2005
