Hereditary," WORST movie I've seen in a loooong time!
",If I could've give it 0/10 I would! Made the mistake of going to see this piece of garbage based on hype alone. I just spent 2 hours in a movie theater checking my watch and waiting for it to be over. I would've left half way through but kept thinking 'maybe something will happen to make this better!' Needless to say nothing happened and nothing got better. 2 hours and I genuinely couldn't tell you the story line!!! If this was the best horror movie of 2018 anything else that comes out doesn't have much to live up to. Save your time and money.,1,4,9,28 June 2018
