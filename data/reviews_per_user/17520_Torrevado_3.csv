The Expendables 2," Expandables 2 is too cruel to enjoy (Review by lifetime Sly fan)
","I wanna thank Sly for his hard work at keeping the 80s action alive. You can tell he has put his whole heart into this project. And this time he really has EVERYONE on board. Not an easy task.The cast is great. Arnold, Couture, Chuck Norris and Van Damme are hilarious. Dolph Lundgren is awesome too, and he proves that he actually can act. Statham is great as an angry British mercenary. Sly is wearing different clothes in every scene and i think he is also wearing a wig. He is macho, with make-up and rude to the ladies. He is way too serious in this movie.The action is WAY BETTER than in Expendables Pt 1. You can now understand what is going on, who is where (no shaky cam). The plot is ridiculous and i'm fine with that. What bothers me is the senseless violence in Expendables 2. It's just shocking. It is not cool, Commando-type funny violence. It is pure gore, ugly and disturbing. Totally unnecessary. There is no explanation who is the enemy. Or what are they fighting for? The Expendables shows no respect for human life. It is all a shoot-them-up video game. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone under 18.",4,17,28,7 September 2012
Terminator Salvation," John Connor meets the Transformers.
","What a mess. I actually expected better. I knew it was gonna suck, but not this bad. This was a joke and a mockery of the first two Terminator movies. I'm glad Stan Winston R.I.P never got to see this crap.Bad: - the script is very very weak - novice director - no atmosphere. - there are no characters, you don't care who wins - everything explodes, nothing is memorable - when you leave the theatre, you feel disappointed - plot holes - the music. the movie would have actually gained had there been no score at all. - some strange new terminators. one is as tall as a house - the worst part, you don't really give a crap - cheesy philosophy part in the end.. something about the differences of man and machine - honesly i was begging for the credits to start rolling - the 'computerised arnie-face on a cyborg' part is so random - spoiler, In the end, a metal pipe is pushed through John Connor, he looks like he's gonna die (because he don't have any internal organs left), but he gets away and later gets a heart transplant. - the model who was Marcus' friend, obviously has time to wear makeup and make curls for her hair. Nothing depressing about this kind of future. - the last minute plot twist with Marcus - the cyborgs are like James Bond villains: when they have finally captured Connor (leader of human resistance), they just throw him around. The don't kill him.Good: - the actor playing Marcus does a decent job - actor playing John Connor is very good - most effects are good. i wish there was less explosions. - Helena Bonham Carter's role was OK, but the movie gained absolutely nothing with her inclusion - C.Bale's acting was good, but this is by far his worst movie.McGee sucks. He missed the point of the 2 original movies. Sad Whole movie in 1 word: A mess. 2/10",2,3,6,25 June 2009
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," This movie is really weak.
","The only good thing about T3 is when you think of oneliners you get for those Arnie soundboards. I give credit to the writers for continuing the original story with the inevitability of the coming nuclear war.The biggest problem with this movie is that you don't care what happens next. A lack of suspense.The dialogues are not written with passion. A lack of feeling.John Connor has been made a wuss and is miscast even then.The T800 is not really protecting John nor Kathleen in this one. The bullets are flying left and right while he just drives the van. They're just driving into freaking Mexico. They have no plan.The TX - the new Terminator villain is not explained at all. What is she? What are her special powers? How exactly is she more advanced than T1000? She jumpstarts a car with her fingernail - what is that? She can produce any weapon but how? This whole concept is really lacking imagination. The TX visual display screen is really lacking imagination. Kristina Loken is quite attractive but she is not scary in any way.Claire Danes is the best part of this movie. Her character makes ridiculous choices but thats because of the bad screenplay. She plays good.Kathleen Brewster's father is really miscast.Some of the action scenes were quite enjoyable. The jokes are cheap and recycled from previous Terminator movies.The camera angles are wrong, T800 is not shown strong. Editing is wrong. (A lot of boring dialogue could have been left out.) The scenes are too clean. (Where is all that dark and gritty future?) The car chase was pretty cool. The CGI snake is fake. The music has no bass and low frequencies. The movie feels dated already. Stan Winston has done a good job with the endoskeletons but the camera is not capturing it. Too much stuff is copied from T2: Judgement Day. This whole thing reads like some kid's school paper to me...",1,0,3,11 May 2012
