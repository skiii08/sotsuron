The Ring," fairytree
","I watched the original japanese film a few years ago and thought to my self wow that was a really good horror, a one of story line a story never been used before on screen.That makes such a change compared to all these new horror films that pop up from time to time, dreamworks made the remake and this mistake happens so often, the remake is nothing like the original screen master piece. Sure these companies have got the money got the actors but the films never quite cuts it. I have seen many many horror films one of the best by far and always will be is the exorcist the same as starwars for science fiction films, however the ring was up they some where with the exorsist, i love the 80s and 90s horror flicks they were the best and always will be. It was so refreshing to watch a truly excellent horror film the story the acting the effects it was great.But be warned this film is about as dark as it can get it gets into your head and stays they for a little while. As so many new horror films go wrong in todays society they forget the one thing that so many lack ,psychology fear.Remember when we were kids we were all terrified of what was under the bed ,when the bedroom light was turned off they are no boundaries of fear nor the imagination. If you can put this mental feeling into an audience for an hour and a half you are on to a winner, the ring did just that one of the best horror films i  have watched up to date horror writers take note.",Null,1,2,18 March 2004
Dawn of the Dead," Good effort
","When i first went to watch this film last weekend i was a bit sceptical after i had heard all the hype surrounding it.  I wasn't too impressed with the first opening scenes to the film, as unlike the original George A Romero trilogy the film seemed to lack the gritty and dark atmosphere they had. The story in the remake seemed to be more inventive and interesting.  I don't want to ruin too much of the story line for you so i will give you my favourite moments.  Watch out for the zombie baby, and the ample sized zombie lady!  The chainsaw scenes were also not to be missed.  These zombies were fast mothers, unlike the stiff, slow zombies that would normally blow over in a brisk breeze!  These zombies were like the ones out of 'The return of the living dead'.  The story in whole was a good balance of acting and effects and plenty of tense fear pumped into the audience, but sadly this film lacked the true zombie atmosphere.  Approximately half way through the film the story line showed the characters playing sports games, looking through telescopes on the roof and generally trying to pass the time.  These scenes were unnecessary as a zombie flick should be a bit more depressing and dark.  The zombie scenes were excellent, i was almost hanging off my chair in suspense, sadly the zombies were not as rotten and fearful as i was hoping unlike 'zombie 2' or 'day of the dead'.   The most impressive scene was towards the end of the film when the zombies had managed to enter the mall and the remaining survivors escaped in two armoured buses, crashing through the car park gates into a sea of zombies.  There were not many gore scenes in the film, but the ones they had were nice and juicy!  As far as zombie remakes go it was a good effort.  I think for any true zombie horror fan its worth a look, but this remake is not on the same level as George A Romero and Lucio Fulci.",Null,0,0,2 April 2004
The Exorcist," The most famous horror film ever made!!!.
","Wow you could write a book on this film dont worry iam not going to.Ok so it was 76 or before and an audience was just sitting down to watch the film ,remember all the horror films they were used to are at that time is hammer horrors and John carpenter and Tobe Hopper great film makers.And then came along the exorcist and totally destroyed the audience both mentality and physically.The problem was this film was about twenty years ahead of its self, and twenty years to soon for the big screen as well.The general public at that time in are history had suffered also  from viewing this film.Some had died of heart attacks or killed themselves after viewing the film, babies had been lost through shock and stress and reports of other health issues relating to the film ,no wonder back then there was religious groups handing out leaflets warning people not to view this film.The mystery of these causes did not stop there.I think it was about 8 or 9 members of the film crew died of unknown or un- natrual causes as well while in the making of the film.Images appeared on still photos of the set and film.The most disturbing scene in the film is the spider clip of linda blair coming down the stairs, why this was not included in the film is beyond me that had to be the best scene ever used in horror film  cinema history.You can see this clip and other really interesting info in the fear of god, a documentary on the exorcist film as well as the film lts self, but this may only be available in england iam not sure.One of the younger priests who was shooting a scene went for lunch a small restaurant was across the road from the set there the actor sat down to have some lunch ,there he had got talking to a real priest,the real priest warned him the devil does not like to be shown the way  the film was portraying him to the world he will seek retribution on all those that portrayed him this way said the priest, true stuff honest!!.I actually watched the true documentary story on a satellite channel  a few years ago  a  story of a young boy that had become possessed.The exorcist film had used one or two pieces in the film.This documentary scared the pants of me.A summary of this film is the exorcist is  as dark as it can get it is based on a true story just to make matters worse.If you have not seen this film you must off been dead or in space for the last 25 years sure it was banned for some time, but its out now the question is are you ready to watch it, be advised watch it with caution!!!!.As one councellor said in a reveiw of the exorcist in a british horror magazine called the darkside' know person can sit through this film with out it having some sort of effect on that person viewing such material'.",Null,2,3,23 March 2004
War of the Worlds," best sc fi since star wars
","Wow!, the first scenes of the alien craft rising out of a crater from within a road was wicked, it was quite a dark film for Spielberg, but a brilliant one, one man's battle (Tom Cruise) to keep his two children safe and well and his struggle to try and find safety and also to escape these killing alien craft. Simple story with excellent acting all round and fantastic special effects. Spielberg seems to prolong and concentrate on the doom and gloom of the alien invasion. As mankind and the world is being wiped out,unlike films like Independece Day,Signs,Evolution etc, not even half way through these films the good guys are winning and all is well, War of the Worlds is the complete opposite. You don't even see the army or any shadow of help until about half half way through the film. I was just sat in my cinema seat thinking bloody hell everyone's going to die, this is the end of the world but just as in the original ending the aliens didn't die from mankind's resistance or weapons but of microscopic germs which they were exposed to when they came out of their crafts. Mankind lost the alien battle invasion but survived.",9,1,3,9 July 2005
Evil Dead II," A quality remake with superb horror make up.
","Poor old Ash he is just not having a good time with these holiday breaks in the log cabins, far up in the woods. Maybe he should of chose a different vacation. Confusing to some people this film may be, why would Ash return to the cabin after what happened in the past? I would say this film is a remake of the original rather than a sequel. The makeup and effects are fantastic throughout the film, i actually think part 2 was better than the first, the same as Aliens was better than Alien. There are not many horrors out there, especially the 80's type, where the sequel was better than the first. The story line is very similar to the first film but more detail and depth is incorporated into part 2. The gore level is pretty good, i think sadly some scenes may of been cut or removed before video release, but still there are a good few demons and demonic creatures popping up throughout the film. The ending involving the tree was too much and for me totally ruined the end. The scene with the chainsaw and the eye of the tree was over the top and should never have been used, but still it was a brilliant film.",8,1,1,14 April 2004
