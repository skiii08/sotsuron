The Blair Witch Project," Not scary, just tense.
","'Tense,' not 'scary' is a more truthful description.  I liked that it wasn't a slasher and had almost nothing grotesque.  The movie lacked good dialogue but it did keep me interested.  Don't expect your heart rate to go up until the last 15 minutes.  IF YOU GO, SEE A MATINEE.",3,1,2,4 August 1999
