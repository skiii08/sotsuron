The Incredible Hulk," Better than the first, but not perfect
","I'm a massive Hulk fanboy (it's the only thing I'm a true fanboy about), so take this with a grain of salt.First off, they skip the entire story of how Bruce became the Hulk and they sum up what should have made the first 15 min of the movie in about 30 seconds. My girlfriend was pretty lost because of this and she didn't really know how the Hulk came to be.Second, I really wish they would have picked someone other than Liv Tyler to do Betty. She shows so little emotion during the movie that it is nearly impossible to like her, hate her, etc. The rest of the cast (Norton, Roth, Hurt) did an amazing job and I felt like the bottleneck was Tyler.Third, the action was really nice and really entertaining, but I hated how they downplayed the Hulk's power and anger so much. There were several times when Betty was about to be hurt or die and he doesn't get much stronger. The Hulk and the Abomination are about the same strength when they start but the Hulk gets more powerful as he gets angry. You don't really see much of that and it would have added so much to the movie. Also, in the comic book the Hulk could jump a few miles at once. One time he even jumped into ORBIT. In the movie he couldn't jump to the top of a building.All in all though, it was a good movie. The pacing was a bit fast, but it was manageable. Don't let everything I said prevent you from watching the movie. As I said, I'm a huge fan of the Hulk and I could probably find a flaw with anything related to him.",8,3,9,13 June 2008
Iron Man," Amazing
","I typically don't take the time to write something like this, but I can make an exception for Iron Man. I am a huge comic book fan, and so far many of the comic book movies have fallen somewhere between mediocre and downright crap. There are exceptions to this rule (Spiderman 1&2, X-Men 1&2, Batman Begins), but Iron Man dominates them all. Downey does an amazing job of portraying the character of Tony Stark and he delivers one liners like no one else can. The composition and editing in the movie is perfect and the pace felt spot on. On top of all this, the visuals and music were the best I've seen and heard yet.Let me put this in perspective for you: my girlfriend fell asleep during Batman Begins and she thought the Spiderman series was 'ok.' She loved Iron Man though and has recommended it to everyone she knows. For a girly girl like her and a comic book nerd like myself to enjoy it, it must be amazing ;).",10,6,12,4 May 2008
