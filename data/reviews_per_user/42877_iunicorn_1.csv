The Blair Witch Project," A great movie it is for all audiences.
","As a foreign audience, I also feel that this is a great film. You do have the expectation to wait and see what happens next. You do expect them to be safe at all times throughout. You also feel that there is something strange about the place. It's very much like any school kid's camping, or excursions, that you always bump into something strange, and want to check out what it is all about. When they reach the ghost house, and it ends, and you just have all resolutions of your own stories of what has happened to them. A great movie. It's gripping in every twist and turn. I have a private collection, and it's hard to find. Any serious film buff should watch this film, it just explains how creative the next generation of film-makers can be.",Null,0,1,16 August 2000
