The Blair Witch Project," NOT for the 'MTV/Nintendo Generation'
","First of all I really, really liked this movie. But then again I have an imagination. I thought this movie was the most thought and sensory invoking movie I've ever seen. No there aren't any quatrillion dollar special effects. The fear is much more cerebral. Anyone who has spent as much time as I have outdoors, knows how every breaking stick sounds like a gun shot, and every gust of wind sounds like an animal growl.If nothing else, the movie is brilliant as an experiment in human behavior. To watch how confusion, fear, hunger, exhaustion, and isolation will break a person down. during my days in the Army, I've spent weeks at a time in the jungles of Central America, and know what it's like to be lost and tired, and scarred. Try it some time.OK so the constant movement of the camera was a little much, but I never really noticed it much. If you go expecting a big James Cameron THX monster to pop out for a bunch of explosions, don't see it. Because you will be disappointed. That's why I say NOT for the MTV/Nintendo generation. There is no constant barage of light and sounds and explosions and music and CGI monsters and stuff to bombard the senses. You have to IMAGINE what it's like to hear something outside your tent at 4:00 in the morning.
If you want special effects go watch the next ready made block buster trillion dollar extraviganza. If you have an imagination, and would like to be genuinely scarred, see the Blair Witch Project. This is movie making stripped down to the basics. 8 out of 10 *'s",8,0,1,29 May 2000
MASH," Masterpiece
","I am a little biased. MASH is my second favorite tv show of all time, but this predecessor is really an eye opener. Showing in detail the inner workings of a front lines medical unit, it is a little more gory then the tv series. But looked at from a movie standpoint, it was quite a ground breaking movie. The overlapping dialog, the way the film cuts away to a different scene in the middle of a conversation to give the scene more impact, and the indepth characters. War is terrible, but this shows how some people managed to keep their sanity, in one of the most diabolical ways to separate a person from reality, by playing pranks, and using their wit and quips. Based on the novel of a real life MASH surgeon, this movie is a testament to the human spirit, and a must see.",8,0,2,29 May 2000
