Black Swan," The ENVY of dark thriller movies
","My boyfriend and I saw this together for a movie date; I know how to pick out films due to the trailer or other reviews in total. When I first saw the trailer of Black Swan, which was played at the Toronto International Film Festival I knew this movie was a must see on my list. I then read the phenomenal reviews from many critics about the film and decided that no matter what I would see it for sure.I found what drew me into the movie was not only the dark thrill, but the ballet and the classical music. Here's hoping this movie gets an award for the music score, it was all pure classic. The suspense of the movie started to really draw me in, some parts could be predicted at times however the film could still be pulled off and made where there was always another unexpected twist.I would recommend this movie if you're into dark thriller movies, but to warn you it's really graphic and creepy. However I say go for it if you're really into that kinda stuff. I give this movie a 10/10 review and don't be surprised if Natalie Portman wins big for this film, this masterpiece is something that you gotta see it to believe it.",10,1,4,29 December 2010
