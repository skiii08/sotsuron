E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," review of E.T.
",E.T. is a really good movie. I like Science fiction. The special effects are old but it's also attractive. All the new movies now are made with new technology. E.T. has been made without all of this but it's still known and a lot of peoples still like this movie. E.T. is a pleasing emotional story and I think it's never boring. Some scenes are really funny but on the other hand some scenes are sad and serious. I like it. The characters are really nice. Eliot plays very well his role. I would recommend it to everybody who has never seen it before. It's a famous movie and everybody should watch E.T. Do you like this movie ? What do you think about it ?,10,0,1,6 November 2009
