The Incredible Hulk," I was expecting a typical MCU blockbuster...
","...and was heavily disappointed.The story is boring and predictable and the villain has no credible motivation: He wants a good fight. There are a lot of obvious inconsistencies: Travel distances don't matter, the Colonel is the Head of the USA, no fatalities by Hulk, escape from crashed helicopter is not possible because a corpse lies in the window and so on. I also didn't like some of the cliche characters either.I wasted 2 hours I could have spent with another movie.",4,2,4,20 August 2018
