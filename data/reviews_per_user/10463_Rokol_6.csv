Vertigo," Hitchcock's best film
","I have been watching old Hitchcock classics for a while now and I can say that vertigo is without a doubt Hitchcock's best filmThe use of the camera and way the movie tells the story comes close to perfection. Kim Novak gives a superb performance, and I can tell the same thing about James Stewart. But what really makes me like this movie so much is the tension betweenthe characters and there way of responding with their environment. It just seems that you are being dragged into another world. Also the ending is one of the most memorable endings in cinematic historyOverall Vertigo is the best movie I have ever seen and I rate it a 10/10",10,3,6,19 July 2004
As Good as It Gets," Highly recommended
","'As good as it gets' is tragic comedy about a writer Melvin (Jack Nicholson) who is afraid of germ-infection from other people and other places. At the beginning of the film we see him being hostile against his gay neighbor and his dog, we also see him having lunch at the same restaurant where he always wants to be served by the same waitress.The Jack Nicholson character stands pretty much central from the beginning of the film, but that is going to change when the other two leading characters start to develop. The waitress Carol played by Helen Hunt has a very sick son and he is in desperate need of medical help. Melvin is prepared to offer this help in a kind of way by submitting a doctor for him. Here fore he asks of her just to keep serving him at her restaurant.The third leading character Simon who is a painter gets harassed early in the movie. Simon ends up in a hospital and is threatened to lose his apartment because of financial depths. From this point a relationship begins between Melvin and Simon.At a certain point in the movie the three characters make a trip to Simons parents for financial support. Here all the characters really melt together and some good scenes come along. The acting of all three parties is great. The dialogue is pretty decent and the story shows little flaws.Of course the outcome of the movie is predictable and a Hollywood ending can't lack from the film. But overall I still highly recommend this movie. Final grade 8/10",8,0,1,7 January 2005
Good Will Hunting," terrific job from Matt Damon and Robin Williams
","After seeing the remake of Hitchcock's masterpiece 'Psycho' I didn't know if I would ever watch a Gus van Sant movie again. But at a rainy Thursday night there was nothing on TV except Good Will Hunting. Hearing some people say how good this movie was made me want to give it a chance. So I did. Thirst I must that the acting is pretty decent here, even Ben Affleck (who I normally can't stand) seems to know what he is doing here. Robin Williams gives a marvelous performance and so does Matt Damon. I already knew how talented Matt Damon was when I saw him in Rounders and the Bourne Identity, but I think this was his best performance I have seen so far. The dialogue of the movie is superbly written. Some of the sentences really make sense and go deep. The story isn't bad and the character development is also very good. The direction is fair enough although I didn't really pay attention to that. Maybe I even overlook the 'Psycho' remake incident. No not really!!!!!!But still this movie is very good and I sure recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good movie once in a while. Grade 8/10.",8,0,2,6 January 2005
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Really bad!
","Wrong, wrong, wrong!!! Hollywood you are doing it all wrong again. This isn't a proper suspense-movie. New characters are thrown in this movie every minute, they mention there name only once, then they instantly get killed and are already forgotten a second later. The only two characters the viewer could possibly care about are Alice and Jill Valentine. And the Jill character is hardly developed and enters the film without the right introduction.Now every good filmmaker knows that building the suspense during the film will give maximal impact at the end. Obviously these guys don't know. Already the first two minutes I see zombies running down the street killing of people. Cops pumping 200 rounds of ammunition into the zombies bodies and there are explosions everywhere.And what is the deal with all those curse words. Don't they have any idea that kids will watch this trash to. I thought Hollywood made all audience movies these days. A PG-13 rating would give us a movie just as bad as the R rating gave us.But the real problem with this movie is the editing. This is by far the worst editing I have ever seen in a film. The scene at the graveyard where Alice and her mates get harassed by zombies who come out of the ground is horrendous. The fight scene here is about a one-frame cut. The camera constantly moves real fast, and you can't recognize any moves or any of the characters who are executing them. But if you thought that this scene was bad just wait for the fight between the Nemesis and Alice. Boy what were the director, cameraman and editor thinking here. Probably 'I get paid anyway so what the hell.'Admitting that I saw a 'making of' on TV before I went to the theatre, you might think they warned me enough to avoid this porker. But no I was stupid enough to pay 10 hard earned Euros. To keep you from making the same mistake, I will give you some words of advice:This movie is a complete waste of money and time. Roger Ebert wrote: 'I you meet anybody who likes this movie, don't let them date your children'. I couldn't agree more. The first Resident Evil wasn't a masterpiece, but compared to this joke it could have been a multiple Oscar winner. Avoid this one at all cost except if you are contemplating suicide!",3,2,6,15 January 2005
Bring It On," great fun
","This movie isn't really about anything except dancing, and if you like dancing than you are in the right place. The story follows a cheerleading squad that won the national championships like 4 times in a row. This year they get heavy competition when another squad comes along who claims they stole their cheers. I know this doesn't sound like the most original and complicated plot, but what do you want from a movie like this. Kirsten Dunst looks fabulous and so do all the other cheerleaders. The dance sequences are nicely choreographed and the movie spoofs with the common high school traditions. Now don't expect a masterpiece here but just lower your expectations and enjoy the ride. It's worth renting or watching for free on cable.Grade 7/10",7,0,0,6 January 2005
Ran," cinematic perfection
","I have had the pleasure to watch Ran twice this year. I purchased the 2 set DVD about 9 months ago and I must say it was worth the heavy price. The second time I viewed this masterpiece pleased me just as much as the first time I've watched it. The direction is stunning (ofcourse it is: KUROSAWA!!!)and the costumes, sets and colors are all state of the art. I haven't had the opportunity to read King Lear but I sure want to give it a try. Although Ran is not my favorite Kurosawa film (I would say it's Ikiru)I think it is his second best film. I only defeats seven samurai with a few inches, and that's because i think the story is more interesting and obviously the battle scenes are a bit more realistic.But all in all he made so many great movies it is hard to decide which one is his masterpiece. But Ran sure belongs to his best films. 5/5 stars.",10,0,3,5 January 2005
