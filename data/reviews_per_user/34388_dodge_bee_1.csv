Walk the Line," Walk the Line...a must see!
",I thought Joaquin and Reese did a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of Johnny & June. Waylon (Jerry Lee Lewis) Payne gave an A+++ performance as well. There were things that were surprising and shocking about Johnny that I didn't know until seeing this. It prompted me to do some research on him. I found some of the details in the movie don't exactly match other sources. This is probably because they had to pare 30 years down to two hours. I will be buying Johnny's books for the 'rest of the story'... This is a movie I will watch time and time again. I bought the soundtrack yesterday and have been listened to it many times already. I hope all involved in making this movie win many awards! They deserve it!,10,0,0,18 January 2006
