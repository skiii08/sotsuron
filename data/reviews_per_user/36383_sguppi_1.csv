Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Best movie this season
","I loved it so much. Best movie this year! So much fun, action, drama, humor. It is entertainment, it is excellent, it is wonderful and Robert Downey Jr. is perfect!!! Along with his excellent fresh ideas and overall movie making, Robert Downey Jr., and Jude Law give great performances once again. They have the best chemistry I have seen between a Holmes and Watson character, which is one reason why this movie is so great. The ending was probably the best part out of the entire movie. I think this is a significant improvement to the first movie with the characters and plot. It's a Downey movie and that's good so. He runs everything.",10,3,8,19 December 2011
