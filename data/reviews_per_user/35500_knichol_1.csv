Walk the Line," I loved it!
","I am not an expert on Johnny Cash, I liked him, but he was before my time. I have been reading about the Carter family for the last couple of years and so was familiar with the story of June and John. Joaquin blew me away and Reese proved that she can act and deserves to be taken seriously. I loved this movie, I would love to hear the two of them comment on this film. They can't have been huge fans either, but for some reason their chemistry makes this work. I recommend it highly. I have heard some of the criticisms, Joaquin is too short, Reese too pretty but I had no trouble believing them as John and June. I wanted to be entertained, not pick something or someone apart and I was entertained, transported even, to their lives. What more should a movie do?",10,2,4,21 November 2005
