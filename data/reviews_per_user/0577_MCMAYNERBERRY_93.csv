National Treasure: Book of Secrets," A Spirited And Precise film
","For Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), history isn't just a dry record of what's occurred in a distant and half-forgotten past... for him, history is alive, vital, and occasionally it offers the possibility of finding extraordinary treasures. After his astonishing discovery of the riches of the Templar Knights, Ben has become the world's most famous treasure hunter... although he prefers the term 'treasure protector.' Ben and his father, university professor Patrick Gates (Jon Voight), are shaken by the discovery of one of the long-lost pages from the diary of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth. The diary was found on Booth's body when he was killed; however, several pages had been torn from the diary and have never been found... until now. Surprisingly, the information on this page seems to implicate their ancestor Thomas Gates as a co-conspirator in the assassination of President Lincoln.Ben must work with his now ex-girlfriend, American history archivist Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), and his tech-wiz partner, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), in a globe-trotting adventure which dangerously criss-crosses the inner sanctums of Washington, D.C., Paris, London and the American heartland.As Ben, Patrick, Abigail and Riley meticulously unravel clues which threaten to turn history, and their lives, completely upside down, their search for historical truth widens into a hunt for perhaps the most mysterious and highly guarded book on earth and, from that, to a famed mythological treasure. Much to Patrick's consternation, Ben calls upon a secret weapon -- his formidable mother and Patrick's ex-wife, linguistics professor Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), who hasn't spoken to Patrick in 32 years. She is soon caught up in the intrigue, but the team is not alone in its pursuit. The man who brought the lost page to Ben's attention, Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), has his own family history to uncover. But his ambitions are less noble than merely discovering treasure, putting him on a deadly collision course with the others in a desperate effort to uncover the secrets that lie beneath the half-burnt diary page from America's past.

Walk the Line," Johnny Lives On In Joaquin
","In 1955, a tough, skinny guitar-slinger who called himself J.R. Cash walked into the soon-to-be-famous Sun Studios in Memphis. It was a moment that would have an indelible effect on American culture. With his driving freight-train chords, steel-eyed intensity and a voice as deep and black as night, Cash sang blistering songs of heartache and survival that were gutsy, full of real life and unlike anything heard before. That day kicked off the electrifying early career of Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix).

In the most volatile period of his life, he evolved from a self-destructive pop star into the iconic 'Man in Black' -- facing down his demons, fighting for the love that would raise him up, and learning how to walk the razor-thin line between destruction and redemption. As his music changed the world, Cash's own world was rocked by the woman who became the love of his life: June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Walk The Line 10/10",10,1,1,7 April 2009

","Bruges, the most well-preserved medieval city in the whole of Belgium, is a welcoming destination for travelers from all over the world. But for hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson), it could be their final destination; a difficult job has resulted in the pair being ordered right before Christmas by their London boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to go and cool their heels in the storybook Flemish city for a couple of weeks.Very much out of place amidst the Gothic architecture, canals, and cobbled streets, the two hit men fill their days living the lives of tourists. Ray, still haunted by the bloodshed in London, hates the place, while Ken, even as he keeps a fatherly eye on Ray's often profanely funny exploits, finds his mind and soul being expanded by the beauty and serenity of the city.But the longer they stay waiting for Harry's call, the more surreal their experience becomes, as they find themselves in weird encounters with locals, tourists, violent medieval art, a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) shooting a European art film, Dutch prostitutes, and a potential romance for Ray in the form of Chloe (Clemence Poesy), who may have some dark secrets of her own. And when the call from Harry does finally come, Ken and Ray's vacation becomes a life-and-death struggle of darkly comic proportions and surprisingly emotional consequences.

He made Dillinger America's first Public Enemy Number One and sent in Purvis, the dashing 'Clark Gable of the FBI.' However, Dillinger and his gang outwitted and outgunned Purvis' men in wild chases and shootouts.

The Other Boleyn Girl," Scarlett Johansson headlines a major list of reasons why this movie is terrible
","Never have I seen such a melodramatic, boring and insulting adaption of the tale of the Boleyn family. A film that substitutes historical accuracy for soap opera antics and loathsome acting.The casting of this train wreck is wrong, with numerous better British actresses who could've done a better job. Portman manages to hold firm but Johansson's evident disinterest in even being on the set is off putting and her utter laziness when it comes to speaking dialogue or expressing emotion is frustrating. This is meant to be a period piece, there's a certain calibre of acting you need to bring to the table, and she fails to do so, making it clear she was only cast for her A-List status.Bana isn't very interesting as Henry, popping in every now and then to say 'hey, this is still a film based off a true story', as the focus of the film, to it's very minimal credit, keeps centred on the Boleyn's, even if a majority of it was made up for dramatic plausibility. When you have to make things up to make a film that's supposed to recount a real event, then it's clear that it's not meant to be a film. Perhaps if they told the story with the actual events, a way better actress than Scarlett Johansson as Mary and a lot more life into this dull, tired flick, maybe it could've worked, but considering the choices they decided to make, The Other Boleyn Girl fails.The Other Boleyn Girl 1/10",1,0,0,30 October 2013

Don Jon," A film that muddles it's hard hitting commentary on today's culture with stereotypical rom com fluff
","I really wished this would've turned out better. I do. The message it strives to convey is an interesting one on the way people view media, but it unfortunately gets bogged down by corny scenes and underdevelopment.Levitt, in his directorial debut, plays Joe 'Don Jon', a stereotyped version of a New Jersey boy who, after bedding various one night stands, becomes enchanted by Barbara, played, sigh, by a very weak Scarlett Johansson. What is it about her? Her range is just not there. It always seems half assed and never fully committed to any film she does. And though it's cute that she plays a stereotyped version of a Jersey girl, there's no real emotion there to make me connect with the character, and therefore the film suffers. Joe and Barbara begin a relationship, with Joe modelling his love life after the porn he watches and Barbara after the romantic movies she enjoys. Complications arise when their views collide and cause irreparable harm to their relationship.It spurns Joe to be taught how a relationship truly works by Esther, played by Julianne Moore. The character has a backstory, but there's no real development aside from that. She's just kind of there.But what really makes Don Jon not work is how, while depicting the exaggerated views people hold, they exaggerate the way people from New Jersey act. A lot of residents from the area were offended when they were depicted as, for males, sex addicted, body building tough guys and for females loud, gum smacking, hoop earring wearing divas. It's inaccurate and unfair towards how life really is in New Jersey.I once again assure I liked the message it tried to convey, but it's flaws stand out and become too distracting.Don Jon 5/10",5,1,9,30 October 2013

As he teams with his rail-thin, unconventional partner, Esqueleto (the Skeleton), Nacho feels for the first time in his life that he has something to fight for and a place where he belongs.As Lucha is strictly forbidden by the church elders at the monastery, Nacho is forced to lead a double life. Disguised by a sky blue mask, Nacho conceals his true identity as he takes on Mexico's most famous wrestlers and takes on a hilarious quest to make life a little sweeter at the orphanage.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson make this the best Marvel film to date
","Captain America: The Winter Soldier isn't just a phenomenal sequel, its the best Marvel movie in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.Chris Evans is back as Captain America, and I feel we should all give Evans the credit he deserves. He provides the character with a likability that allows you to sympathize with him. I find the highlight of the entire film is the chemistry between Evans and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow. This being their fourth film together, they manage to deliver a believable relationship that evolves from mere partnership to a strong friendship (maybe even romance in future instalments). This is the first Marvel film to have two Avengers actually have a connection between one another depicted fully. Widow is implied to have history with Hawkeye, but we only saw one scene with them actually building in that.Though the villain kind of serves more as a plot point, The Winter Soldier breaks Marvel's streak of forgettable bad guys (Whiplash, Malekith). He's not even really a villain, but I won't spoil anything.I'm glad to see more of Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill as she's not been given able time to show off her abilities. She's cunning and quick, and serves more purpose in this film than the trailers would show.The additions of Anthony Mackie and Robert Redford are welcome ones, with both their characters providing us with a more detailed character arc and plot then we've been receiving in the post Avengers sequels.If I was to nitpick, I'd say Frank Grillo and Emily VanCamp as Brock Rumlow and Agent 13 were pretty underwhelming. Rumlow appearing as the typical bad guy and Agent 13 only appearing to further the plot and set up the rest of the MCU.Captain America: The Winter Soldier makes me hopeful that future Marvel movies play out like this one: suspenseful, entertaining, funny at times and overall exciting.Captain America: The Winter Soldier 10/10",10,0,1,4 May 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," This time, Bourne comes home.
","What a way to end a hugely successful series. Though there is talk for a 4th film, Matt Damon, Joan Allen or Julia Stiles aren't coming back unless it's Paul Greengrass, who unfortunately left the project back in September. So it looks bleak right now for a 4th Bourne.All he wanted was to disappear. Instead, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is now hunted by the people who made him what he is. Having lost his memory and the one person he loved, he is undeterred by the barrage of bullets and a new generation of highly-trained killers. Bourne has only one objective: to go back to the beginning and find out who he was.Treadstone, the top-secret black-ops program that created this super-assassin, is now defunct. It has been reimagined as the joint Department of Defense program Blackbriar, with a new generation of trained killers--hidden from domestic or foreign oversight--at the government's disposal. To them, Bourne is a $30-million malfuntioning threat who must be taken out, once and for all. To him, they are the only link to a life he has tried in vain to forget.Bourne has reached the end of the line. This time, he will not stop at his former masters' empty promises or even with the killing of those who relentlessly pursue him. With nothing left to lose, he will use each nuance of his training and every finely honed instinct they taught him to come after his creators and finish it all.His quest will take him from Moscow, Paris and Madrid to London and Tangier--evading, outsmarting and outmaneuvering Blackbriar operatives, federal agents and local police every step of the way--in a desperate quest to find answers to questions that haunt him. And Bourne's journey will ultimately lead him to where it all began and where it must come to an end: the streets of New York City. The Bourne Ultimatum 10/10",10,1,3,2 January 2010

The Happening," Happened Too Fast
","It begins with no clear warning. It seems to come out of nowhere. In a matter of minutes, episodes of strange, chilling deaths that defy reason and boggle the mind in their shocking destructiveness, erupt in major American cities. What is causing this sudden, total breakdown of human behavior? Is it some kind of new terrorist attack, an experiment gone wrong, a diabolical toxic weapon, an out-of-control virus? Is it being transmitted by air, by water.. how? For Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) what matters most is finding a way to escape the mysterious and deadly phenomenon. Though he and his wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel) are in the midst of a marital crisis, they hit the road, first by train, then by car, with Elliot's math teacher friend Julian (John Leguizamo) and his 8 year-old daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), heading for the Pennsylvania farmlands where they hope they'll be out of reach of the grisly, ever-growing attacks. Yet it soon becomes clear that no oneand nowhereis safe. This terrifying, invisible killer cannot be outrun. It is only when Elliot begins to discover the true nature of what is lurking out thereand just what has unleashed this force that threatens the future of humanitythat he discovers a sliver of hope that his fragile family might be able to escape what is happening.

","When they were kids growing up together in a rough section of Boston, Jimmy Markum (Penn), Dave Boyle (Robbins) and Sean Devine (Bacon) spent their days playing stick ball on the street, the way most boys did in their blue-collar neighborhood of East Buckingham.

Now a homicide detective, Sean and his partner (Fishburne) are assigned to the case. They must also stay one step ahead of Jimmy, a man driven by an all consuming rage to find his daughter's killer. Connected to the crime by a series of circumstances, Dave is forced to confront the demons of his own past. Demons that threaten to destroy his marriage and any hope he may have for a future.

"Hail, Caesar!"," Rather Disappointing
","I'm typically not very enthusiastic about the Coen brothers comedy movies, but I heard this one was about the shenanigans of the film industry in the early days, so I was modestly excited.So it's unfortunate that Hail Caesar is a bland, unfunny experience with only sporadic chuckles.The Coen's assembled an A-list cast for this outing: George Clooney, Josh Brolin, Tilda Swinton, Ralph Fiennes, Channing Tatum, etc. And outside of the main characters Brolin and Clooney play, everyone else feels...squandered. Wasted in over glorified cameos. Jonah Hill's only scene in the movie was featured in the trailer. And all other members of the cast are involved in plot lines not directly involved with the main story. Like what Family Guy goes with their non sequiturs.Scarlett Johansson is definitely the weakest link in the cast, donning a hokey and distracting New York accent as she goes about playing an actress who's pregnant during her movie's filming (oh, the irony). It just seemed like an unnecessary part of the film that could've easily gone without.Roger Deakins is once again behind the camera and once again delivers a stunning visual palate, but it doesn't do much to help the movie from feeling dull and overall a disappointing effort from the Coen's. Though it isn't on the level of disappointing as The Ladykillers, it is far, FAR from being on the level of Fargo and The Big Lebowski.Hai, Caesar! 5/10",5,18,35,4 February 2016

Lucy," Dumb. And not in a good way.
","Let's get the controversial part of the film out of the way: the science is laughably wrong. We will not gain superpowers by using 100% of our brains. With that said, Lucy isn't even an enjoyable mindless action film. It's actually pretty bad.Lucy is a hodgepodge of concepts lifted from the likes of The Matrix, Akira, Limitless, etc., and manages to not be awesome. The main flaw of the film has to be the main character. Played by Scarlett Johansson, who by the end of the film seems to just not care about actually acting anymore with the robotic nature of her dialogue delivery, the character is one that is meant to be the person you care about the most. Trouble is, I don't care, as she is basically indestructible, and the antagonists are your run of the mill gangsters. No excitement, so sense of danger, nothing. A scene that rubbed me the wrong way was when Lucy confronts two taxi drivers and kills the one that doesn't speak English. The guy had nothing to do with her dilemma, and she just killed him. It makes me unable to like the protagonist.The action was fairly underwhelming, which is shocking considering the director of The Fifth Element, The Professional and Taken was at the helm. But it is what it is.One upside to this film is that it doesn't outstay it's welcome. It ends and you quickly forget you even saw the filmIt's mindless, and probably meant to not be taken seriously, but even then, the only time that audiences could enjoy this is if there is absolutely nothing else to do on the day they see this. Lucy is boring, unoriginal and just plain dumb.Lucy 2/10",2,12,30,24 July 2014
