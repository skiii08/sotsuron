The Monuments Men," Monumentally Bad...
","What a long, tedious, pointless story told badly. I can't recall another movie I walked out of in recent memory but this was one. One would expect some modicum of entertainment from such a big production,but this is pure Hollywood pap. Very seldom would I rate a film a 1 out of ten. This was a pure pot-boiler. I am having trouble expressing how poor it was from the beginning until I gave up. Yeah, complete with the fat Nazi riding int he back of a limo...yeah, we get it, the Nazi's were bad guys. This is a total turkey. How many lines do I need to describe how breathtakingly bad both the acting an directing were. No continuity, no character development, predictable dialogue. This movie is a stinker.",1,0,0,3 August 2014
