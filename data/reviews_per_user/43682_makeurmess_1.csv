The Rock," Sean Connery eat your words
","When this film came out, I recall Sean Connery blasting Michael Bay and saying all kinds of bad things about him as a director, (similar to Al Lewis (Grandpa Musnter) about Robert Zemeckis). Anywho - I think this is the best thing Connery has been in since his 007 days and I don't think he's been in anything near as good since.",7,4,5,10 October 2003
