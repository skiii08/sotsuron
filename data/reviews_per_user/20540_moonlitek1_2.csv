The Blair Witch Project," An awesome horror flick!
","WHOA, look at all those bad comments! Time for a change.My brother took me to see 'The Blair Witch Project' for my birthday and I was terrified. I already knew the ending though, so it didn't scare me as much as I had expected. But I was shaking when the credits rolled.All anyone ever complains about is that this movie didn't live up to the hype and all that - well, the hype was half the fun! I saw the Blair Witch show on the SciFi Channel and I got so scared that I actually started to cry (at the time I thought it was all real).Half the reason people say this movie is 'stupid' is because they don't understand it (boy am I gonna get it for that one). They went into the theater expecting something like 'Scream' or 'Urban Legends' - you know, with a jump every minute & enough gore to make it an anatomy lesson. Instead, they got a great psychological thriller (*Oh no! A change in the typical horror movie pattern! I can't handle it!*).I give 'The Blair Witch Project' 4 1/2 out of 5 stars. Way to go Heather, Josh, & Mike! You guys ROCK!!",10,1,2,2 January 2000
The Breakfast Club," A great movie, to put it simply.
","Hi everyone!Let me start out by saying that I truly love this movie. To me, it is a movie I can watch again and again, finding something new to like about it with every viewing.Okay okay, you already know the story line and all the characters, so I'll just cut to the chase.Without a doubt, Judd Nelson gives the strongest performance in TBC. He hits every line perfectly and nothing that he says or does is ever out of character. No other actor could have played John Bender as well as him - he just fits the part so well, in appearance and actions. Not that his appearance is bad. His eyes are so gorgeous..and his hair, and his smile, and...you get the point. But I digress.Another strong performance, in my opinion, is given by Ally Sheedy. The girl hardly says anything in the entire movie, and yet her character 'speaks' to you more than the others. Plus Allison was one of the coolest people, anyway. How come she didn't have friends? I would've hung out with her.Molly Ringwald, Emilio Estevez, and Anthony Michael Hall give great performances too, though not as strong as the other two. Molly gives off the 'rich kid-prom queen' vibe better than any other actress probably could. She doesn't make her character fake, like the snobbish types are in movies today. She gives Claire depth.Emilio Estevez is good in TBC, though his real shining moment is when he talks to Allison about her problems. His emotions are so apparent during the dialogue...it's at that pivotal moment that you know his athlete character has real feelings, too. And I swear, Anthony Michael Hall can do no wrong. He is so cute in this movie...his character is so believable. What an amazing underrated actor!*Spoiler*The only problem with this movie is the fact that a) Allison gets together with Andrew at the end when b) she could have gotten together with Brian (or not gotten with anyone at all). Andrew does drop little hints during the movie, if you watch closely, that he likes her, but they got together too quickly for me. It would have been a bit better if they'd just left the detention as good friends.And besides, why pass up Anthony Michael Hall? He's adorable in this movie. :o)Well, that's enough of my babbling. See 'The Breakfast Club.' Two thumbs up, four out of four stars, 10/10. The Brat Pack at its best.~ Peace out ~",10,0,1,30 June 2000
