Blade Runner 2049," Pretty, but slow, self-important and a pseudo-profound but implausible plot
","Maybe I'll give it another shot, but I found it incredibly slow to unfold. like you knew how every scene was going to resolve before it did. Beautiful sets, as has been mentioned, but totally lacking in all of the detail that made the first movie such a compelling environment. Ridley Scott got his start making commercials, and he always had a gift for packing a lot of visual information in a shot. That is really lacking. The script felt like it needed another re-write, and the editing was too self-reverential.",6,2,4,31 January 2018
The Adventures of Tintin," Well-crafted homage
","Picasso said 'Good artists borrow, great artists steal.' There's a lot of borrowing in this film. When, the opening credits rolled on Tin Tin, I inwardly groaned. John William's score and the title sequence were a rip-off of 'Catch Me If You Can'. Spielberg's own rip-off of 1960's title sequences. Spielberg (and Williams) repeat themselves in this movie, but there is enough that is new and fresh to save the day. If you remind yourself that this movie is intended for an audience that may not have seen all the clichés that are used, it is quite a good movie. First and foremost, the animation is stunning. It manages to cut a line between comic book and realism that is fresh without feeling contrived. Your mind's eye comfortably settles into this world. The effects are subtle and effective. The back of a hand morphs into a desert dune. A desert dune morphs into an ocean wave, all beautifully done. The story incorporates 3 Tin Tin books in rather seamless fashion. The core relationship, that between Tin Tin and Captain Haddock (both beautifully voiced by Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis) rings true. John William's score, while cutting no new ground, serves this adventure as well as the score in Indiana Jones. In fact, there is not a lot to separate them. But if you forgive these gents from repeating themselves and look at the film with new eyes, it's really a very fine and entertaining work. Seen it before? Yes. Seen it done better? Not really.",8,0,0,5 March 2012
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Solid and well-crafted Whodunnit Suspense Thriller
","When you make a remake of a movie version of a well-loved book series, you're going to upset some people. Normally I wouldn't be interested in seeing something so far removed from the original, but the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a shot, and I was not disappointed. This is a very solid movie. It is difficult to take a book with the complicated relationships of Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and turn it into a comprehensible movie script, but I think this film succeeds. Is it 100% faithful? No, many details have been left out. Does it need to be? If you feel a movie's first objective is to be a 100% accurate reproduction of the source material then this movie is a failure.If, however, you feel that a movie should stand and fall on its own merits and should be its own experience then I think this movie succeeds. Daniel Craig's persona lacks a bit of warmth which I think his role needs to engender Lizbeth's trust, but that is my biggest complaint.Having seen the movie, you will not have read the book. But you will have seen an intelligent, well-crafted re-imagining of the original.",8,3,7,11 February 2012
The Hurt Locker," Exceptional Movie about the experience of war
","This is the best movie I have seen this year, and one of the best war movies I have ever seen. Kathryn Bigalow has presents a tightly constructed unrelenting look at the pressure and perverse thrill of living with death as a constant companion.Oddly enough, the experience of this movie for me was very much like 'Das Boat', the German WWII movie that made the viewer feel the sweaty claustrophobia of being under attack on a submarine.The movie follows an American bomb squad in Iraq as they investigate and attempt to diffuse bombs and IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) in the field. A new squad leader poses some problems for the group, but this review is concerned about the plot.This movie does two things as good or better than any war movie I've seen. One, it gets you into the mind-space of going to work each day in an environment where a single misunderstood detail can end your life.The second great accomplishment of this movie is that it shows how impossible it is to live in this environment and not be changed by it. Some experience the flip side of fear as the adrenaline rush of being alive. But for some that adrenaline clouds their judgment, and makes make them seek that which they fear the most.An unforgettable film, highly recommended.",8,2,5,30 July 2009
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A great movie starts with a great script
","Charlie Kaufmann is the brightest light in American screenwriting today, period. 'Eternal Sunshine' is not only a great script, it is brilliantly realized. Not only in Michel Gondry's direction, but Valdís Óskarsdóttir's creative editing give Kaufman's ideas a wonderfully non-linear canvas on which to roam.The best way to see this movie is to know as little about it as possible. Suffice to say that it is an examination of the cost of loving and losing. Is love worth the pain? The hoariest question in romantic comedies, right? Except the answer to that question lies at the end of an astonishingly original landscape of inventions that allow the viewer to look at an old question in new ways.Jim Carey and Kate Winslett are star-crossed opposites: Carey plays the introvert and Winslett the extrovert. It works well. Hopefully Carey will learn that taking all of that energy and compressing it inside a repressed introvert can make a much more interesting and adult character.
I can't imagine this film not winning best original screenplay.",8,0,1,25 April 2004
In Time," In the future, everyone will live in a Beer Commercial
","In the future the world will be composed of a demographic that is critical to the enjoyment of 18-34 year old movie goers. Just like beer commercials, there is no one over 25 years old to gum up the works. Everyone's mom is a milf. Science has figured out how to make people immortal, but has evidently forgotten how to make a car manufactured after 1985. Most of the world looks like either Century City or the Los Angeles river basin.Just like today there is the 99%, who live literally day-to-day, and the 1% whose luxury is predicated on inequality. Hopefully the movie viewers (the 99%) will not notice that the actors, the writers and the studio are trying to get into the 1% by make the others pay for the privilege of watching this dreck.Ah, it's not THAT bad. I just get sick of future dystopias where the writers stopped after pitching the concept and didn't bother creating a world (or characters for that matter) that have any nuance. Think of all of the visual detail in a movie like Blade Runner. That is what this movie lacks.",6,0,0,10 March 2012
Rango," If you like movies, you'll love Rango
","Don't be fooled by the PG rating, or the fact that this is an animated movie. This is a film for adults. Picasso supposedly said 'good artists borrow, great artists steal', (he may have stolen the line from someone else) and this movie makes unashamedly wholesale thefts from a number of movies and books. Start with the writings of Carlos Castaneda, flavor with a heavy dose of Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, blend in a rather strong resemblance to the plot from Chinatown, season to taste with Star Wars, Blazing Saddles, Bugs Life, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Indiana Jones and High Noon. The next time I see it I'll try to make a list of all of the other references. If the movie was boring you would at least be entertained by trying to guess where it all came from.Despite the movie's rather complicated family tree, it all hangs together very well. If I were pitching to a studio, I'd say it was 'Carlos Castaneda versus Noah Cross'.And oh, by the way, the voice acting and animation are as good as I've seen. I just finished watching a rental copy on DVD and I can't wait to buy it on Blu Ray.Literate and funny, this is a movie that aims much higher than the typical summer animated fare. HIGHLY recommended.",Null,1,2,16 July 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Wes Andererson, warts and all
","**Tiny Spoiler** Early in the film a scoutmaster (Edward Norton) at a boy scout summer camp notices that one of his charges is not at breakfast. He inspects the camper's tent, which is empty, and notices a map on the wall. Pulling the map down, he reveals a large round hole cut in the side of the tent which was used as an escape route. That the camper could have easily unzipped the tent and walked out misses the point: this was an ESCAPE from a prison of sorts. The visual metaphor is more important than reality. That pretty much sums up the sensibility of a Wes Anderson film: s gentle absurd aesthetic that is a possible meeting of Holden Caufield, Richard Brauntigan and Stanley Kubrick. Some directors try to break out of the 2-dimensional boundaries of film, Wes Anderson plays there. His wide lenses and flat tracking shots are like turning the pages of a lushly illustrated children's book. Like Kubrick, his actors are characters more than real human beings. I like Wes Anderson's movies, but his highly stylized structures can sometimes constrict, rather than expand, his expressiveness. Moonrise Kingdom is a beautiful, gentle fable that could have been better than it was. I just wish the director would trust his characters to breathe on their own.",7,2,3,16 June 2012
