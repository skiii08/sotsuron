The New World," Separates the 'lovers of cinema' from the 'average movie watcher'
","Separates the 'lovers of cinema' from the 'average movie watcher'.Yes it is slow. If you view that as a negative then don't go see this.If you have a passion for cinema, this film is a gift. If you 'just like going to the movies', then this film will cure your insomnia. Better to spend your cash on Last Holiday and let true cinema nerds like me take in this masterpiece. Every. Single. Shot...is a work of art unto itself. I even forgot that I hate Colin Farrell. Thank you Mr.Malick. I look forward to your next masterpiece a decade from now.",10,192,369,21 January 2006
