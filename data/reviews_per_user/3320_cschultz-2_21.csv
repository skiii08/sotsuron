Blade Runner 2049," Glacial Pace, Ponderous...But Seamless Continuity
","Occasionally a major motion picture will be modified by a film studio based on the criticisms of test audiences prior to the movie's release, and without the creative participation of its director or screenwriters. Such a movie was 1982's 'Blade Runner,' directed by Ridley Scott and released by Warner Bros. At last count, 'Blade Runner' existed in some seven different incarnations, including the original version, the studio-modified version, the restored version, one with narration by star Harrison Ford, another with the narration removed, and others with scenes either augmented with additional footage, or removed entirely.Set in a bleak and hopeless Los Angeles in the year 2019, 'Blade Runner' imagined a future in which human-like androids, called replicants, are manufactured to toil as slave labor in off-world colonies. Mostly indistinguishable from actual humans but with superior endurance, intelligence, and strength, a group of replicants escape to Earth from their off-world settlements. A burned-out LA police detective is assigned the task of hunting down the escaped replicants and destroying them. The term 'blade runner' describes a hunter of replicants.Despite its troubled production history, many consider 'Blade Runner,' in either or all of its incarnations, to be among the best science fiction movies ever produced. And in the thirty-five years since its original release, fans have been clamoring for a sequel.'Blade Runner 2049,' released on October 06, is that long-awaited sequel. Set thirty years after the original, 'Blade Runner 2049' follows yet another blade runner, now investigating the remains of a replicant who displays postmortem evidence of having produced a child— unthinkable to their technology. The officer is assigned the clandestine task of locating the child of the replicant, if it exists, and destroying all evidence surrounding the pregnancy and the birth.Produced by many of the same people responsible for 'Blade Runner'— Ridley Scott returns, this time as a producer, leaving the direction in the able hands of Denis Villenueve—the sequel is a worthy follow-up to the legendary original, although the picture is not without problems. Presumably because so many versions of the original picture exist, the sequel seemingly attempts to embrace them all. And as a result, the movie displays a tendency to over-explain even the most rudimentary points, accounting for both the picture's glacial pace and its mammoth running time of nearly three hours.As a means of compensation, 'Blade Runner 2049,' with an estimated budget of some $180 million, is also bigger than the original in every way possible—visually stunning, filled with sometimes astonishing optical effects, and with a booming synthesized music soundtrack strongly reminiscent of the popular Vangelis-composed original. Much like the music from Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' from 1968, the 'Blade Runner 2049' soundtrack emphasizes music tones so low on the chromatic scale that they're often felt rather than heard, underscoring the audience's frequent sense of awe.Actor Ryan Gosling, playing the 2049 blade runner, is appropriately conflicted by his assignment, and eventually troubled with dividing loyalties. Harrison Ford also turns up somewhat late in the picture to reprise his role from the 1982 production. And to the filmmakers' credit, the continuity is nearly seamless even after a thirty-five year hiatus.Despite his prominent billing in the picture's advertising, Ford's role is relatively small, but the resolution of the film's plot relies on his character's participation. Which begs a question—since Ford's participation in 'Blade Runner 2049' was far from a sure thing until almost the beginning of production, what would the filmmakers have done had the actor declined to participate?",7,4,10,9 October 2017
It," Faithful to the Novel
","While not the best picture based on a novel by perennial bestselling author Stephen King—that distinction would probably be held by 1994's 'The Shawshank Redemption'—'It' is probably the most comprehensive.At a whopping 1138 pages, Stephen King's novel 'It' reads like an encyclopedia of not only horror, but also horror movies and rock 'n roll music. Iconic movie monsters from Frankenstein to the Creature from the Black Lagoon make brief guest appearances in the book, and a bibliography of musical selections quoted in the novel takes up two full pages at the end, as sort of required listening.While the new motion picture version is not quite as detailed as the book—to accomplish that, 'It' would need to have a running time numbering in days instead of hours—the picture does certainly have an epic feel, with the movie's seven or eight major set-pieces based solidly, accurately, and even lovingly upon the events described by King in his novel...although mercifully the metaphysical aspects of the tale are eliminated. Although the filmmakers nominally set the film in the late 1980s instead of the late 1950s era specified in the novel, in essence the movie exists in sort of a generic time-frame which might almost be any era from the 1930s forward, to the present day. The only actual visible milestone in the picture is the advertising of 'Batman' and 'Lethal Weapon' at the local Bijou—presumably as a sort of in-joke, since both pictures were also Warner Bros. releases.Briefly, in 'It' a group of seven children identify in an otherworldly, malignant, psychotic clown the living source of all worldly evil, and seek to destroy itparticularly after the younger sibling of one of the children becomes one of its victims, and the children deduce that the monstrous clown feeds not only on fear, but also on actual human lives, especially those of the young.The scares keep coming in 'It' at such a pace that the audience has little chance to catch its breath, let alone collect its thoughts. Although the picture does not contain as many sucker punches or low blows as, say, 1973's 'The Exorcist'—another Warner Bros. release, by the way, based on a bestselling novel—'It' plays not only on the audience's fear but also on certain paranoias and even a handful of phobias. The images depicted in the movie run the gamut from the mildly disturbing to the genuinely shocking to the jaw-droppingly horrific. This might be the rare movie which is rated R for its fright ratio, although the violence and bloodshed are present in abundance—in one scene a geyser of blood erupts from a bathroom drain.Adapted from King's novel by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga, and Gary Dauberman, and directed by Andy Muschietti, the movie benefits enormously from the casting of the children. The seven young actors appearing as the group of friends in the movie are a remarkably talented and persuasive group of children, with young Jeremy Ray Taylor and Sophia Lillis contributing particularly vivid characterizations as an overweight outcast and the supposedly 'loose' girl from the wrong side of the town's tracks, respectively. Also an asset to 'It' is the casting of young Finn Wolfhard as the most sarcastic and irreverent member of the seven. Already familiar to many viewers from his role on television's 'Stranger Things,' Wolfhard with his constant flow of cynical wisecracks provides a nice counterpoint—possibly even an emotionally-necessary one—to the movie's seemingly inexhaustible supply of horrific images and scenarios. Actor Bill Murray performed much the same function in 1984's 'Ghostbusters.'Although self-contained as a stand-alone feature, a title superimposed on screen at the very end of the picture designates 'It' as chapter one of a larger story. Readers of the novel are already aware that the group of children must reunite as grownups to again battle the clown monster—indeed, even in this picture the children recognize that the evil returns to their town in twenty-seven-year cycles. Still apparently undecided is the number of sequels which will be necessary to complete the story, but educated guesswork suggests more than one—'It' has earned gross receipts exceeding $179 million in the first four days of international release, and at the present time exhibits no trend toward slowing its rate of commerce. Hollywood rarely turns its back on a moneymaker prior to exhausting the supply of financial resources. There's already talk of a continuing television franchise.Needless to say, 'It' is not for very young children, or even sensitive adults. And for viewers troubled with coulrophobia—the irrational, paralyzing fear of clowns—'It' additionally presents an enormously satisfying opportunity to whisper to the world, 'I told you so.'",8,5,12,11 September 2017
If I Stay," Affecting, Without Being Manipulative
","'If I Stay' is without shame a picture aimed straight at the tear ducts, presumably in the belief that a good crying spell is both therapeutic and cathartic for the spirit. And the picture mostly works hard to earn its tears honestly: The characters are attractive and appealing and likable, and the actors playing the characters also are attractive and appealing and likable. This is the rare picture which features no bad guys. Everybody's a good guy.Based on Gayle Forman's 2009 young adult novel of the same name, 'If I Stay' chronicles the emotional experience of a buttoned-up 17-year-old cello prodigy Mia Hall, played here by actress Chloe Grace Moretz, and her worlds-colliding romance with an up-and-coming young rock-and-roll guitarist named Adam. That both Mia and Adam are on the cusp of professional breakthroughs in their musical pursuits accounts for most the of the ups and downs in their relationship.Unfortunately, their romance is in the middle of one of its downs when Mia and her family are involved in a catastrophic auto accident, casting Mia into an out-of-body experience in which she can observe the people she loves, but not communicate with them or interfere with their actions.'If I Stay' is a picture that gives you the kind of satisfaction you get from being on time for an appointment, following your doctor's orders, eating the right cereal, taking your medicine as prescribed, or getting a flu shot: You might rather be watching 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' a 'Fast and Furious' movie or 'The Expendibles,' but you just know that a movie with this much cello music in it has got to be good for you.And it is fairly good. Young Mia has wonderful support from her parents, a set of amiable former rockers played appealingly by Mirielle Enos and Joshua Leonard. Leonard especially, late of 'The Blair Witch Project' hysteria of 1999, has matured into a solid character actor and possesses a sort of good-natured, loopy appeal which in 'If I Stay' contrasts nicely with the buttoned-up performance of Moretz as his daughter.In the film, it's shown in flashbacks that Mia's folks grew up and embraced responsibility when it became apparent to them that the late nights and party lights did not blend well with parenthoodan epiphany which makes even more perplexing their almost pushing young Mia out the door to be with her rocker boyfriend.As Mia's rock guitarist boyfriend, Jamie Blackley is somehow manages to be sullen without actually pouting, and is simultaneously withdrawn and inarticulate about romance yet strong-willed and verbose about music. You can see why Mia's attracted to Adam, but if you're like me you might be more than a little conflicted about their falling into bed quite so quickly, especially if, like me, you view the picture with your girlfriend's adolescent daughter present.Unfortunately, at some point—I'm not exactly not sure when, but I think it's about an hour into the picture—the narrative becomes sticky and manipulative, and the picture begins to rely on broad characterizations, familiar stereotypes, and the familiarity of plot devices from movies past, to sort of swindle the tears from the audience.And that's too bad, because by that point I'd already decided I enjoyed the picture, and was unprepared to modify my opinion. That the scene which I believe began the manipulation featured the showcase moment for veteran actor Stacy Keach, as the crusty but lovable old Grandpa, made the cheat seem even more unexpected and surprising. Keach, much like Robert Loggia, seems like such an honest, sturdy, and dependable actor.But having said that, about 80% of the success of 'If I Stay' belongs to young Chloe Grace Moretz in the central role as Mia. Moretz is earnest enough in her craft to make us care about young Mia even through her most puzzling and selfish interludes.Moretz followed 'If I Stay' with a supporting role the high-profile action film 'The Equalizer,' with Denzel Washington. And combined with 'If I Stay' and Moretz' affecting characterization in the title role of the most recent remake of 'Carrie'—not to mention Hammer's under-appreciated 'Let Me In' and the 'Kick-Ass' pictures—it's plain that this is one young actress who's going places. Fast.I liked 'If I Stay.' But I think I already told you that.",8,12,15,4 June 2015
Detroit," Stunning
","The Academy Award-winning filmmaking team of director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal turn from the Gulf War setting of their films 'The Hurt Locker' and 'Zero Dark Thirty' toward the battleground of a racially-torn United States during the summer of 1967 in their new picture 'Detroit,' an intimate, brutal, and terrifying chronicle of an incident which occurred at the Algiers Motel during the summertime riots in that city fifty years ago.In 'Detroit,' a man foolishly fires a toy pistol from a window during an all-night drinking party at the Algiers Motel, and a team of rogue police officers leave the scene of the nearby riots to respond to the motel incident, with retribution rather than justice on their minds.Actor John Boyega contributes an intricately-balanced, almost saintly performance as a part-time security officer at a local supermarket who's drawn into the events at the motel, and is willing to endure the cardinal indignity of racism as a means of disarming the volatile situation and saving innocent lives. The ensemble cast also features vivid characterizations from actors Will Poulter, Anthony Mackie, Algee Smith and many others in a story about the sanctity of human life and the sometimes-casual misuses of power.Coupled with the realization that the absolute worst of human nature can erupt in any person at any moment, 'Detroit' is as frightening as any horror movie in recent memory, and is made even more upsetting when the viewer realizes it's all based on a true story— updates on the lives of the survivors appear at the end of the picture. The lessons of fifty years ago are as relevant today as the terrible night when the events in the story occurred. For that reason and many others, 'Detroit' is highly recommended.",9,2,8,27 August 2017
Wind River," Elegant In Its Poignance
","'Lyrical' is an accurate term to describe the superb drama 'Wind River.' 'Poetic' and 'haunting' are other appropriate terms for this genuinely moving little picture, which seemingly came out of nowhere to score heavily among critics and has been developing a strong word-of-mouth following since its quiet release in early August.In 'Wind River,' a veteran officer with the Wyoming Fish and Wildlife Service while tracking a rogue mountain lion discovers in a remote wilderness location the body of a young woman who appears to have been sexually assaulted and murdered. That the young woman was a Native American from the local Shoshone Reservation eventually complicates and even hinders the identification and apprehension of the killer.The FBI assigns to lead the investigation an inexperienced young agent, and she solicits the assistance of the Wildlife officer. He guides the rookie agent with his expertise while using the case as a means of seeking personal redemption for an act of irresponsibility which led to the unsolved murder of his own teenaged daughter a few years earlier.The critically-acclaimed 'Wind River' benefits enormously from a quietly authoritative performance from Jeremy Renner as the veteran Fish and Wildlife officer. This is a role which is quintessentially American—at one time the part would've been performed by Steve McQueen, or by Gary Cooper thirty years before McQueen, or by silent screen star William S. Hart thirty years before Cooper. Renner and his performance are easily comparable with the legendary stars of motion picture history.Also starring in 'Wind River' are Elizabeth Olsen as the rookie FBI agent, and the wonderful Graham Greene as the Native American tribal police chief nominally in charge of the local part of the investigation. The younger sister of the once enormously-popular Olsen Twins acting and singing team from the 1990s, Elizabeth Olsen has matured into a legitimately persuasive and talented performer on her own.In 'Wind River,' Olsen benefits greatly from performing a role with similarities to her own novice career as an actress—possibly somewhat insecure among the veterans, but canny and practical enough to request and rely upon the guidance of the seasoned pros. Olsen's performance is persuasive, and uniquely effective. Olsen can genuinely act, literally among the best of them. And veteran actor Greene, effective earlier this year in a small but pivotal role in the popular 'The Shack' but known as well for his signature role in the classic 1990 western 'Dances with Wolves,' again uses his sleepy eyes and relaxed, almost excessively informal demeanor to disguise a wise and wily character—sharp and experienced, despite a lazy and vaguely incompetent demeanor. In this way, Greene has matured into a sort of modern-day Robert Mitchum. When during a dangerous confrontation Olsen's FBI agent requests backup reinforcement, Greene patiently explains to her, 'This isn't the land of back up—this is the land of you're on your own.' His manner is quiet and firm, but kindly, and gentle.Written and directed by the talented Taylor Sheridan, also the writer of the critically-acclaimed 'Sicario' from 2015 and last year's 'Hell or High Water,' 'Wind River' doesn't miss a trick or leave a plot thread undeveloped. Already known as an enormously talented writer, Sheridan with 'Wind River' becomes a director to keep an eye on in the future.But 'Wind River' belongs primarily to Jeremy Renner, in his affecting performance as a decent, solitary man trying to do his best against opposition, apathy, and sometimes overwhelming odds. Despite the actor's strong showings in 2010's 'The Town,' for which her received an Academy Award nomination, and in 2009's Academy Award-winning Best Picture 'The Hurt Locker,' this is Renner's career-best performance, at least so far.Filmed, beautifully, on breathtaking Utah locations, 'Wind River' was financed in part by the Tunica-Biloxi Native American tribe. A closing title notes that missing person reports are tracked for every United States demographic except Native Americans. But far from being a diatribe on Native American human rights or the undeniable and unconscionable slights against their heritage, 'Wind River' is simply a classic American drama about strong and morally conscientious individuals banding together and trying to work through their responsibilities with a sense of honor, dignity, and integrity.Forget the awards, the critical acclaim, or the likely recognition during awards season—'Wind River' is a motion picture which will belong in the DVD library of every fan of classic motion pictures, alongside 'Shane,' 'High Noon,' 'The Gunfighter,' and, yes, 'Dances with Wolves.' The final scene especially is almost elegant in its poignant beauty, and relevance. 'Wind River' is recommended, highly and strongly.",10,1,4,5 September 2017
Inglourious Basterds," Better Than You'd Guess
","Writer/director Quentin Tarantino re-imagines history by matching against each other two amiable psychopaths--one an American Army officer and the other an Austrian Nazi--in a customary Tarantino bloodbath, with nothing less than the outcome of World War II at stake.Brad Pitt, as the American, ironically has never been quite so appealing, endearing, charismatic, loose, or just plain funny. And character actor Christoph Waltz, as the Nazi, is a real revelation: His performance received not only the Oscar but also most of 2009's other supporting actor awards.Filled with stylish anachronisms, references to other films, and arch homages to period propaganda, 'Inglourious Basterds,' like the other films in the Tarantino lexicon, is not for all tastes, and most definitely is not recommended for the timid or the squeamish. Additionally, the middle expository interlude bogs down the remarkable momentum of the opening segments but in comparison adds the necessary zing to the climactic hour.All-in-all, 'Inglourious Basterds' is much, much better than pulp fiction has any right to be. By the end of the picture the knowing viewer might very well be not only laughing at the ultra-violence, but also ravening for more.Which is probably the point.",8,1,6,10 March 2010
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Not Bad, Actually
","In the Star Wars lexicon, the new release Rogue One—not designated with an episode number but subtitled A Star Wars Story—inhabits a time roughly thirty years after the conclusion of 2005's Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, and just prior to the beginning of the original 1977 picture: In Rogue One, the oppressive Galactic Empire has designs to build a massive new spaceship called the Death Star, a craft already familiar to fans of the original picture. The Death Star will contain a weapon capable of reducing an entire planet to rubble with one single shot. But the primary architect of the Death Star escapes from the Empire's service before the weapon is functional.Sometime later, the Empire tracks down the architect and conscripts him to return and complete the weapon, leaving behind his young daughter. Years later the daughter, now an adult, is recruited by the anti-Empire Rebel Alliance to locate and enlist the services of the father in destroying the weapon, toppling the Empire, and restoring peace and liberty to the galaxy.Rogue One is a fairly impressive movie in the fantasy genre, not as good as the best entries in the Star Wars series but better than many. Actress Felicity Jones is cast in what is nominally the leading role, as Jyn Erso, the adult daughter of the Death Star architect.Jones' Jyn Erso is consistent with the Star Wars tradition of strong female leads, from Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia in the original pictures to Daisy Ridley's Rey in last year's The Force Awakens. Erso is seemingly a little more indifferent to the niceties of good versus evil, but the character's carefully-maintained ambivalence seems to inspire the audience to desire even more her eventual conversion.But Jones is only the headliner in a strong ensemble cast which includes Mads Mikkelsen from Casino Royale and television's Hannibal, the always-engaging Forest Whitaker, Ben Mendelsohn, Riz Ahmed, Donnie Yen, and Genevieve O'Reilly contributing memorable characterizations. Mexican actor Diego Luna is effectively cast in the swashbuckling role of Cassian Andor, a resourceful pilot working for the Rebel Alliance.There's very much a sense of unification about Rogue One, with appearances by a variety of characters from both previous trilogies. At least one character from the original 1977 picture reprises his role posthumously, via the not-quite-persuasive magic of computer animation.Certain of John Williams' familiar musical themes are repeated from the previous seven pictures, although the actual music score for the picture is credited to composer Michael Giacchino. Giacchino, who also scored the recent Star Trek pictures and Guardians of the Galaxy, already seems to have been so influenced by Williams that his name in the closing credits instead of Williams' is a mild surprise.Rogue One director Gareth Edwards has proved his mettle for putting legendary film characters through their paces with his work on 2014's Godzilla remake. And certainly Edwards' sure hand keeps Rogue One moving along at a pace brisk enough to almost disguise some of the more preposterous turns in the film's script, credited to Chris Weitz and Tony Gilroyalthough twenty minutes could've easily been trimmed from the picture to bring the running time to under two hours.In October of 2012, seven years after the release of Episode III: Revenge of the Sith—which Star Wars creator George Lucas assured us would be the last installment in the franchise—the entertainment world was stunned to learn that a deal had been finalized for Lucas to sell his Lucasfilm Ltd. corporation to the Walt Disney Company. As part of that transaction, the Disney organization also acquired ownership of the Star Wars series of films, released originally by the 20th Century-Fox film studio.Simultaneous to the Lucasfilm acquisition, the Disney Company announced the production of new entries in the Star Wars series, beginning in 2015 with Episode VII: The Force Awakens. The new picture would reunite most of the cast of the original three pictures, and Lucas' services would be retained by Disney as a creative consultant.The first clue that Rogue One is not a typical entry in the Star Wars canon comes in the picture's opening seconds. Although the Lucasfilm Ltd. logo appears prior to the opening shot, as well as the familiar legend 'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away' there is no opening stab of John Williams' iconic theme music, no words crawling from the bottom of the screen to the top explaining the story so far.But the differences between Rogue One and the earlier Star Wars pictures are not limited to the modified opening moments. Since 1977 the pictures in the series have grown progressively more somber, developing a mythology almost as complex and challenging as Tolkien's Rings novels. Last year's The Force Awakens seemingly only barely avoided an R rating, with a My Lai-style massacre at the beginning of the picture and the violent death about halfway through of one of the saga's most enduring and beloved characters.Parents conducting young children to a Rogue One screening should be warned: Even the darkness of vision revealed in The Force Awakens doesn't completely prepare the viewer for the unflinching loss of life and disturbing images in the picture. Rogue One works hard to earn its PG-13 rating: Characters we grow to like are killed on screen, and the graphically-depicted results of the Death Star weapon are more reminiscent of a nuclear holocaust than the bloodless big bang we remember from the original picture. Those who professed wonder or surprise at the 2012 sale of Star Wars to Disney shouldn't have been—George Lucas always did profess admiration for that studio's entertainment heritage.More perplexing at the present time, and especially while viewing Rogue One, is the knowledge that when the Star Wars saga began to explore its darkest and most disturbing themes and images, it did so under the Walt Disney flag of wholesome family entertainment.",7,3,8,21 December 2016
Passengers," An Agreeable Waste of Time
","Set in an undetermined future time, Passengers has some 5000 space pioneers aboard a gigantic spacecraft en route from Earth to an undeveloped and unsettled planet called Homestead II. The travelers were eager enough for a new beginning that they abandoned all worldly friendships and associations, and submitted themselves to suspended animation, enforced hibernation, for the 120-year voyage to the distant Homestead II planet.Unfortunately, some thirty years into the voyage the spaceship runs through an uncharted asteroid field, which causes a system failure. One of the passengers, a mechanical engineer named Jim Preston, is accidentally revived from his hibernation. And after a day or two of exploring the cavernous space vessel, he realizes he's not only alone, but also likely to remain alone from the remainder of his life—his shipmates, including the flight crew, all will be remain in suspended animation for ninety more years.Preston is played by actor Chris Pratt. Pratt is a wonderfully engaging performer who's been attracting a lot of notice recently, not only from his starring appearances in such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy, but also in smaller supporting roles in pictures like Kathryn Bigelow's 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty—he played a member of US Navy Seal team on the mission to kill Osama bin Laden—and Antoine Fuqua's remake of The Magnificent Seven earlier this year.Pratt's screen persona is similar to that of the late James Garner—a reluctant hero with a stubborn streak of integrity dire circumstances can't quite overcome, often conscripted by circumstances to step up and make a stand against forces which threaten others. But unlike Garner, Pratt projects an aura of sweetly childlike naiveté which seems to make audiences want to reach out and protect him.But as Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, and Will Smith learned in the various screen versions of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it's difficult for an actor to appear alone on screen for an extended period and still maintain the interest and emotional investment of the audience. And despite some support from the versatile Michael Sheen as an amiable android bartender who serves as a sort of Greek chorus, a solo performance is what Pratt needs to deliver for the first quarter of Passengers' 116-minute running time. Then his character makes a choice which risks losing the audience's goodwill entirely:After a year of isolation and despite the entertainment amenities and activities of the spacecraft—lounges, gymnasiums, nightclubs, movies, spacewalking, and the most awesome Wii system you're even seen—Pratt's Jim Preston is literally dying of loneliness. He's actually considering ending it all when he becomes emotionally obsessed with one of the 4999 fellow travelers still in artificial hibernation, a journalist played by the wonderfully charismatic Jennifer Lawrence.And the moment Jennifer Lawrence's unthawed feet hit the deck, the movie starts to zing. On full display in Passengers is Lawrence's plain-spoken, self-deprecating let's get this party rolling persona, which has endeared the actress to movie and television talk show audiences over the past handful of years.Lawrence's performance seems also to ignite something in Pratt—their scenes together are as charming as those between the title characters in Disney's Lady and the Tramp, and for much the same reason. As a means of making sure we're paying attention, the filmmakers have named Lawrence's character Aurora, an obvious nod to Disney's Sleeping Beauty, Princess Aurora.But also accompanying Lawrence's arrival on screen is the central on screen conflict: In waking Aurora prematurely from suspended animation, Jim has selfishly robbed her of her plans and ambitions for a life on Homestead II and beyond, for no better reason than to provide company for the lonely mechanic. What's going to happen when she finds out?The filmmakers are not too adept at explaining the science behind the fiction, but are fairly good at covering their tracks: Every time the audience thinks they've spotted an anomaly in the plot, a new wrinkle is introduced that might or might not smooth it over. That's almost excusable in Passengers, because it keeps us on our toes enough to allow other nagging distractions to slip by, such as why Pratt's character left the signature scruff on his face after he shaved off the rest of the fake-looking movie beard he grew during his year of isolation.The one distraction too large to ignore is that Jon Spaihts' script can't decide whether Passengers is a romance, a character study, or a science fiction thriller: It's too much of each and not enough of any. And despite some eye-popping special effects—there's a honey of a scene in which the ship's artificial gravity fails while Lawrence is taking a dip in the swimming pool—there's too much plot going on to pause and savor them.Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who also guided 2014's The Imitation Game, keeps Passengers plodding forward evenly enough to resolve the various plots, although at times the movie seems as tedious as the 120 years required to travel from Earth to Homestead II. And Thomas Newman's techno-pop music score is pleasant enough, with a few old standards thrown in to augment certain scenes, but seems to have been composed for a more lighthearted picture. Whatever it is, Passengers is not a comedy.In the end, it's Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who carry Passengers and sell it to the audience. The undiluted rapport they generate with the audience inspires us to forgive most of the picture's problems and deficiencies. It's an agreeable expenditure of holiday time. Unfortunately, instead of a love story, a persuasive science fiction saga, or a rumination on the effects of isolation, Passengers instead becomes an explanation of why movie stars are paid such enormous salaries.",8,6,10,6 January 2017
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Difficult and Challenging
","The critics are practically falling all over themselves in their efforts to find new ways to praise 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri.' But it's not the kind of praise somebody uses when they enjoy a picture, or are entertained by it.
Rather, the critics seem be heaping upon this movie the kind of praise you'd give to a complete stranger if he made an unflattering but surprisingly accurate observation about you in the presence of your friends-either you compliment him on his comprehension, or risk looking like a fool.
In 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri,' when after seven months no arrest is made for the rape and murder of her teenaged daughter, a grieving mother rents three deserted billboards on the outskirts of town and displays on them messages designed to provoke the local police chief into placing a priority on her daughter's case, and renewing his efforts to locate and arrest her killer.
Written, produced, and directed by the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh-the writer and director of the critically-acclaimed 'In Bruges' in 2008 and 'Seven Psychopaths' in 2012-'Three Billboards' is being described as a black comedy. But more accurately, the picture is a tragedy which occasionally incites a sort of ironic humor. What laughter comes from the picture is rueful, self-conscious, and sometimes even nervous-chuckles with a question mark at the end.
The billboards are at first tolerated by the grieving mother's sympathetic neighbors, then openly criticized. Finally, the community begins to ostracize the woman. And after her billboards fail to achieve the desired result, she escalates her campaign to provoke the police into action, with methods which include assault, vigilantism, and eventually even domestic terrorism. 
At the center of 'Three Billboards' is a riveting, virtuoso performance by Frances McDormand as Mildred Hayes, the grieving mother. In intimately-adjusted levels, McDormand's Mildred slowly loses her sense of rationality, and her ability to interact with society. Her difficulties and emotional agony are reflected in her eyes-as she grows more and more estranged from her neighbors, the light of reason begins to fade from her eyes, and the viewer senses she's losing her sanity, and even her soul.
Along the way, the audience's reaction is tested also. Like the townspeople of Ebbing, the viewer is at first sympathetic to the mother and patronizing of her eccentricities. But as we grow more uncomfortable with her actions-and before long are even horrified by them-we conversely become more sympathetic to the police chief, played with a sense of canny, homespun wisdom by the wonderfully-talented Woody Harrelson.
In case you haven't noticed, Woody Harrelson has matured and developed into one of our most solid, dependable, and inventive character actors. Harrelson's presence in a picture all but guarantees its quality. Those viewers who doubt the actor's ability to stray from his television persona are advised to look at Harrelson's genuinely terrifying characterization in 2013's 'Out of the Furnace,' filmed in and around Pittsburgh. And in 'Three Billboards,' Harrelson contributes a customarily thoughtful and multidimensional performance.
Martin McDonagh's script and direction of 'Three Billboards' makes it heartbreakingly plain for the viewer to observe how easy it is for a person to surrender to bitterness and despair. A flashback scene halfway through showing Mildred and her family interacting with love and warmth prior to the daughter's murder becomes almost unbearable in its contrast to the bitter cynicism of the rest of the picture. 
It's during the flashback that we realize that part of Mildred's mania-her growing outrageousness, and her motivation to maintain the billboards-is a hysterical need to shift the responsibility and blame for her daughter's death away from herself. And it's the growing affection we feel for the grieving mother, the police, and the townspeople of Ebbing which contributes more than any other factor to the ultimately unsettling nature of the picture's conclusion.
Already nominated for six Critics' Choice Awards, 'Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri' is a great film-challenging, and often difficult to watch. In seeing the residents of Ebbing Missouri, we're seeing ourselves through the eyes of outsiders-our strengths and weaknesses, our foibles and eccentricities, our reflexive and conditioned sense of justice. The success of the picture depends almost entirely upon the audience's ability and willingness to recognize and acknowledge in ourselves the unflattering realities as well as the greatness. 
It's not easy to hold a mirror to ourselves and ask, 'Is this how the world sees us?' Especially when the answer is, 'Yes, it probably is.'",8,1,4,14 December 2017
Justice League," A Step In The Right Direction
","Batman needs a shave.He can also use a shower, by the look of things—the brooding countenance he's displayed in more recent motion picture adventures seems to have developed into a full-scale funk in 'Justice League,' or at least a particularly sullen attitude which eventually results in a couple of beatings at the hands of his superhero friends. In 'Justice League,' when an alien despot named Steppenwolf arrives on Earth with his army of deadly cicada-like minions, Batman must recruit a league of superheroes, including Aquaman, Cyborg, and The Flash, to work in tandem with himself and Wonder Woman to defeat the alien threat and save the world.The alien invaders are the least of the superheroes' worries in this picture, compared with the obstacles of clunky dialogue, one tired characterization, and a few plot details which just don't make any sense. From that perspective, Batman's attitude and unkempt appearance are probably understandable, and even more so considering the troubled history of this latest picture from the DC Comics universe. In fact, Steppenwolf and his alien friends might be partly responsible for saving 'Justice League' from complete failure. In development since 2007, 'Justice League' was as of 2014 meant to be the first installment of a two-part series, Zack Snyder's next project after 2013's 'Man of Steel' and 2016's 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.' Once begun, the picture's principal photography lasted from April until October of 2016, after which Snyder brought aboard writer/director Joss Whedon to write a few extra scenes to be shot later, during May of 2017. But the expanded production schedule of the picture was interrupted in March by the tragic death of Zack Snyder's adult daughter (wife Deborah is also one of the producers of 'Justice League'). After the funeral of their daughter, both Snyders returned briefly to the production, but soon abandoned the project to grieve their loss. Whedon's duties were expanded by Warner Bros to include directing the additional scenes he'd written for the picture. Whedon had previously guided 2012's 'The Avengers' and 2015's 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' for DC's comic book rival, Marvel Entertainment. Following the surprise worldwide success of 'Wonder Woman' in June, two more months of additional reshoots were added to the production schedule. And along the way, the picture's budget kept growing until the final cost reached a mammoth $300 million, making 'Justice League' the third most expensive movie in motion picture history, behind the two latest installments in Disney's 'Pirates of the Caribbean' franchise.Whedon was given three objectives by Warner Bros.—lighten the picture's tone, expand Wonder Woman's presence, and deliver a picture with a running time of two hours or less Both 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' had drawn severe criticism for their overlength.The good news is that Joss Whedon has accomplished all three of the Warner objectives. Despite its failings, 'Justice League' moves like lightening at 119 minutes, and contains a plot which is both compelling and relatively easy to comprehend—no small accomplishment in these days of absurdly complicated science fiction. In addition, during the action sequences which occupy much of the film, the screen is filled with images which are eye-filling, and colorful in every sense of the word.The single worst-kept secret in the DC universe is the identity of the iconic superhero who's resurrected from the dead in 'Justice League.' And of the dozens of ways available to regenerate a departed character in comic book-driven science fiction, the filmmakers in this picture have chosen the solitary option which involves grave-robbery, resulting in the film's gamier moments. As an example of the film's clunky dialogue, after the character is revived, his description of the experience is the single word, 'Weird.' When pressed on the point, he elaborates, 'Really weird.'The rookie members of the Justice League fare quite well in the picture— Jason Momoa as Aquaman is earthy, plain-spoken, and raucous, Ray Fisher as Cyborg gives Batman competition for sullen attitude and self-pity, and young Ezra Miller as The Flash displays a hyperactive Howie Mandel- like persona—endearing or grating, depending on your taste. In a world of demigods, Miller's Flash is the audience's surrogate, delivering observations and asking questions the viewer might, if given the chance.But the lion's share of 'Justice League' belongs to Ben Affleck as Batman and especially the delightful Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. Despite Affleck's lazy and repressed performance, his character moves the plot alongeffectively allowing an opportunity for Gadot's star to shine even brighter. If Affleck's performance seems tired and stale, Gadot's is a breath of pure oxygen. 'Justice League' moves the DC superheroes closer to the rarefied air of their rivals at Marvel. And while DC has a way to go before becoming a real threat to the Marvel entertainment colossus, 'Justice League' is a big, and very entertaining, step in the right direction.",7,0,4,21 November 2017
Split," No Hannibal Lecter, but Not for the Squeamish
","Fairly early in the filmmaking career of M. Night Shyamalan, the Philadelphia-based writer and director suffered a terrible professional misfortune—three consecutive films he wrote, produced, and directed became enormous critical and commercial successes.The Sixth Sense in 1999, Unbreakable in 2000, and Signs in 2002—and to a lesser extent The Village in 2004—were mostly lauded by critics for their innovation and imagination, and were embraced an adopted by audiences, many of whom returned for repeat viewings. The Sixth Sense additionally spawned a catchphrase—'I see dead people'—still quoted as among the most familiar in motion picture history.After those remarkable feats of box office legerdemain, critics began mentioning Shyamalan's name in the same exulted breath as Steven Spielberg—and worse, Alfred Hitchcock. Like Hitchcock, Shyamalan often included an unexpected, surprise twist in the plot at the end of his pictures, and also usually either played a small role or made a quick cameo appearance in his pictures. Unfortunately for Shyamalan, after reaching such a rarefied cinematic stratosphere there was precisely one way to go. And from Lady in the Water in 2006 through the almost unwatchable After Earth in 2013, and 2015's The Visit, the filmmaker has been mostly descending into a maelstrom of pedestrian filmmaking.But Shyamalan is trying to reverse his recent misfortunes: In his new picture, Split, released Friday by Universal Pictures, three teenage girls are kidnapped together by a man who reveals himself to be a disturbed individual indeed. The girls' abductor transports the girls to an undisclosed location and tosses them into what appears to be a damp medieval dungeon with cots and a spotless and well-appointed full bathroom.Quickly revealed is that the kidnapper suffers from dissociative identity disorder, multiple personalities. And while each of the man's twenty-three separate personalities seem vaguely aware of each other, only one or two appear to be in charge. Those couple of personalities are prepared to give profane birth to an entirely new manifestation, one which promises unspeakably bad news for the three involuntary guests.Split itself swiftly develops multiple personalities in the form of separate plots: It turns out the kidnapper, played by Scottish actor James McAvoy, has been in the psychiatric care of a renowned and well-heeled psychiatrist played by Betty Buckley, almost unrecognizable from her days as the mom on television's Eight is Enough.The good doc has apparently been earning a pretty penny from papers and lectures about her star patient's multiple maladies. And while the patient has of late appeared fairly benign, the psychiatrist—unknowing of the kidnapping—senses something unsettling enough to begin sniffing around to learn what's cooking.Meanwhile, back in the dungeon, the three kidnapped girls continue to plot, mostly unsuccessfully, to escape their confinement. And eventually it's learned that one of the three girls—the quiet, unpopular high school outcast Casey—has been raised in the footsteps of her loving outdoors-man father, and knows a thing or two about hunting, stalking, and killing prey.Mostly, Split is McAvoy's show, a real tour de force for the actor. It's sometimes forgotten that prior to the actor's recent steady gig as the young Professor Charles Xavier in the popular Marvel Comics X-Men series of pictures—three appearances and counting—as well as in plainly execrable garbage like 2015's Victor Frankenstein, McAvoy was once considered to be a talent of some promise, with performances in such acclaimed pictures as 2006's The Last King of Scotland in 2006 and Atonement in 2007.Possibly the challenge of playing and individual with twenty-three distinct and different personalities was McAvoy's means of groping his way back to his original promise. Unfortunately, the actor seems to perform each individual manifestation with a knowing little smirk, an implied wink at the audience, which keeps the viewer constantly aware that this is a performance, a stunt, and is not believable or credible so much as it is mildly impressive as an acting school exercise.The flip side of McAvoy's multiple characters is Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the kidnapped girl whose survivalist background—and whose own troubled childhood—might provide a key to escaping her confinement. Recently appearing in 2015's controversial and disturbing The Witch, Taylor-Joy contributes a performance which is competent but not particularly evocative—the audience is anxious for the character's situation more than for the character herself. Taylor-Joy with her wide-eyed, emotionless stare seems to be in a hypnotic trance most of the way through the picture's 117 minutes.There's nothing really wrong with Split—the picture delivers enough suspense, chills, jumps, starts and surprises to justify the cost of admission, although it's also sometimes tough to comprehend how the picture escaped the MPAA's clutches with a PG-13 rating when the menace and the subject matter alone should've earned at least an R. One genuinely unsettling early scene in which the kidnapper terrorizes his hostages even strays briefly into NC-17 territory.But thrills aside, the biggest casualty of Split is M. Night Shyamalan's reputation as an innovative filmmaker. Three plots running simultaneously is at least one plot too many. Subtract the survivalist plot and Split becomes a Classics Illustrated version of The Silence of the Lambs, a movie Split references endlessly anyway. Take away the psychiatrist's sleuthing and Split becomes last year's Don't Breathe, Ten Cloverfield Lane, or any of a number of the dozen or so other ubiquitous horror opuses which seem to open almost weekly Mostly, Split references Shyamalan's earlier successes—almost literally, thanks to a significant cameo and line of dialogue at the very end of the picture.But Thomas Wolfe could've told Shyamalan—you can't go home again. Instead, Split suffers from the very mediocrity the director seems to want to emulate from lesser films but exceed in quality and surpass in effectiveness, a feat Hitchcock accomplished in 1960 with Psycho. Possibly Split would've been more successful in its ambition had it been guided by the steady hand of a Steven Spielberg or an Alfred Hitchcock.",5,17,41,23 January 2017
Hidden Figures," A Richly Entertaining History Lesson
","There's a scene in Hidden Figures in which Al Harrison, the harried NASA administrator tasked during the early 1960s with getting an American into space—quick—tells his staff of scientists, mathematicians, theorists, and engineers, 'We all get there together or we don't get there at all.' He's speaking not about ego or seniority or degrees of education, but about the integration of an enormously-gifted African-American woman into their ranks. Although that line of dialogue, as spoken by actor Kevin Costner as Harrison, is inspiring enough to have been prominently featured in the television, radio, and computer advertising for the picture, there's really nothing particularly special about Costner's delivery of the line in the movie—the words are spoken with some authority, but also fairly quietly, almost conversationally, without any emphasis.And that's one of the most likable aspects of Hidden Figures, the new 20th Century-Fox/Fox 2000 motion picture about the early days of the US space program and the importance of three very special people to the project's eventual success in landing a man on the moon. NASA was during that time very much a man's domain. The story of a handful of uniquely-gifted women who were able to gain entry to that exclusive territory is inspiring enough. That some of these women were African-American during a time of segregation and oppression makes a great story even better.With the possible exception of the three women whose story it depicts, Hidden Figures is populated by characters who are sometimes flawed and eccentric or motivated by their own narrow personal agendas, but united in a mission to navigate the impossible, and in the process invent an entirely new branch of science.In this way, Hidden Figures is refreshingly a movie about integration and civil rights in which integration and civil rights are almost—but not quite—secondary to a crackerjack story about exceptional people during exceptional times.Katherine Goble, played by Taraji P. Henson, is an intellectual prodigy whom since childhood has grasped advanced theoretical mathematical concepts as if God Himself were her tutor. A shy, reserved, and bespectacled widow and mother of three, Henson plays the role as if segregation is an unfortunate and irritating inconvenience which only serves to distract her from her primary scientific passion.Mary Jackson, played by model and recording artist Janelle Monae, is a research mathematician and physical scientist who yearns for an education in engineering. The mother of two and married to a civil rights activist, Mary is more career-oriented, determined and irreverently outspoken than her friend Katherine—the word sassy springs to mind. Unable to pursue her educational degree in a state where scholastic segregation is still legal, Mary ultimately takes her ambitions into a courtroom and challenges the law.Dorothy Vaughn, portrayed by the wonderful Octavia Spencer, is the most philosophically-canny of the three friends, seemingly willing to compromise with segregation for as long as it doesn't interrupt her plans or career path. A mathematician assigned because of her gender and race to a secretarial pool, Dorothy finally employs subterfuge, and even a humorous little piece of larceny, as a means of gaining the information she needs to operate the new room-sized IBM computer NASA's experts don't even know how to turn on.Registering the most impact among the supporting characters is Kevin Costner as Al Harrison. As played by Costner, Harrison is so consumed and obsessed with his mission of placing an American into space that he's virtually oblivious to the world and society which surrounds him. A consummate professional, the gruff, humorless Harrison needs the best scientists in the country to help him invent the new science required of his missionno matter their color. Harrison is a fictional character, an amalgamation of several different NASA administrators, and Costner plays him perfectly.Also notable is actor Glen Powell as astronaut John Glenn. Although he does not bear even the slightest resemblance to the astronaut, Powell easily captures Glenn's million-megawatt charisma and charm. When the IBM computer's trajectory figures appear shaky, Glenn insists Goble personally—he calls her 'the smart girl,' the cardinal plaudit in Glenn's vocabulary—check the numbers before he climbs onto the rocket for his launch into history. It's a charming, little-known detail to an American legend, and it's absolutely true.Theodore Melfi guides Hidden Figures with a loose and relaxed hand, wisely allowing the story to unfold naturally, in its own time. He essentially lets the story to speak for itself. While the viewer never gets the sense that actual historical events are unfolding on screen, it's a consummately agreeable history lesson. is so fascinating to others.Hidden Figures takes more than a few liberties with the facts, but the filmmakers will be quick to point out that the picture is not a documentary—the words projected on screen at the beginning of the movie read, 'Based on a True Story.' As Americans, we sometimes seem to hobble ourselves, and move forward only with great reluctance and deliberation. And even accounting for the progress we achieve, often after a period of enlightenment we take a step or two backward and build walls of mistrust instead of bridges of understanding.While Hidden Figures is being described accurately as a 'feel-good picture,' at the time of the historic space mission of John Glenn which concludes the picture, the fire hoses and police attack dogs shamefully used during the historic civil rights demonstrations of Selma and Birmingham were still a year or so in the future.So as we're patting ourselves on the back and congratulating ourselves on how far we've traveled since that time in the early 1960s when Kevin Costner's character in Hidden Figures tells his newly integrated staff 'We get there together or we don't get there at all,' we might also want to be mindful of how far we still need to go.",9,32,68,17 January 2017
World Trade Center," A Kinder, Gentler Oliver Stone
","In 'World Trade Center,' a surprisingly even-handed and well-modulated Oliver Stone steps on the brakes and turns down the volume, and puts away his customary histrionics and hysteria long enough to allow a true story about quiet, ordinary, everyday heroes caught in extraordinary circumstances to stand on its own and speak for itself.John McLaughlin--Nicolas Cage--is a sergeant in the NYC Port Authority PD who's called upon to recruit volunteers to travel across town to the title location to help evacuate the towers following the impact of the first plane; Will Jimeno--Michael Pena--is a Port Authority cop, the first to volunteer, albeit somewhat reluctantly. They and their friends and fellow cops don't know the exact nature of the emergency and they're rusty with the breathing equipment and heavy fireman's gear they're given to wear and take with them, but they're aware the situation is grave and that their colleagues from other, nearer city PDs are overwhelmed. They're also aware that the chances that they might die are superb, and more formidable by the inch. With all this information, they're still standing in the WTC lobby trying to figure out what to do when their world crashes in on them. Literally.'World Trade Center' takes a story we thought we knew and uses it to discover new territory; by turning inward and keeping the special effects to an absolute minimum, Stone and screenwriter Andrea Berloff focus their attention to the formidable heroism displayed that day by depicting what amounts to an extended conversation between McLaughlin and Jimeno. In a way, the movie is as intimate as Malle's 'My Dinner with Andre,' except for the fact that the participants are buried alive in rubble, and quite possibly dying before our eyes.And in listening to the nature of the two mens' conversation--the two discuss the most trivial and banal subjects: Demi Moore, 'GI Jane,' their kids--we realize that the mens' words are secondary to the fact that they are literally talking to keep each other conscious, staving off shock, saving each others' lives. They're decent, ordinary men in circumstances more desperate than most of us can imagine, and through their attitudes and the tones of their voices, they need to rescue each other, prop up each others' spirits, and live.Nicolas Cage disappears to far into the character of McLaughlin that he nearly ceases to exist. A trailer for another upcoming Cage film, 'The Wicker Man,' plays before 'WTC,' and you wouldn't recognize the actor from one performance to another if you didn't already know him. Cage takes the less-flashy of the two primary roles--Pena as Jimeno has the use of his arms and is therefore more animated--but each time Cage delivers a line he refocuses, and rivets, our attention back to his tortured face and vocal tones. By underplaying his role he steals the show.And the competition is keen: Pena is superb as Jimeno; Maggie Gyllenhaal is sweetly perfect as Jimeno's pregnant wife, Allison; Maria Bello is strong and authoritative as McLaughlin's wife; Michael Shannon, as a USMC sergeant from the Midwest who travels to NYC to do what he can to help, seems to be working for a director higher than Stone. Shannon has the bearing and the laser attention of Elijah walking out of the wilderness and into the land of the Baal gods. Frank Whaley, a terrific supporting actor who's never quite been handed a breakthrough role, contributes a quiet, dignified performance as a former paramedic pressed back into service. And check out Julie Adams, as the pregnant Allison's grandmother.Craig Armstrongs's cerebral score sounds enough like Adagio for Strings to contribute an adequate gravitas to the film and remind us we're watching important stuff. And the cinematography, by Seamus McGarvey and augmented by archival news footage and NASA satellite photography, is seamless and stunning: When the first tower collapses, hell is unleashed; when the second tower goes, it happens through our ears and inside our heads. Theatre auditoriums equipped with digital sound might need to boost the film's rating from PG13 to R. So let's hear it for the sound department...no pun intended.By sticking to the facts and allowing the drama to unfold at its own pace, Oliver Stone displays a maturity he's hinted at but mostly kept to himself up until now. For too long, Stone's seemed uncomfortably like the lone adult sitting at the kiddie's table at Thanksgiving. The maturity displayed here, and his choice of an ultimately upbeat and life-affirming story, feels somehow like Picasso caught red-handed in Norman Rockwell territory. 'World Trade Center' is like a Ron Howard film, directed by Oliver Stone.",9,5,12,12 August 2006
La La Land," Entertaining...and Moving
","The decision to either abandon one's dream of success in the arts, or to compromise one's own artistic vision and modify a dream to conform to someone else's, is a heartbreaking and emotionally traumatic moment in the life of a performer. And it is during that transitional moment in the lives of two performers—an actress and a jazz pianist—that the movie La La Land occurs. How the two reach that decision, how they visualize it—and most importantly, whether or not they can survive it together, as a couple—forms the plot of the picture.And what a picture La La Land turns out to be—a 128-minute swirling, colorful explosion of a movie, equally brimming with elation and heartbreak, drama and comedy, but all filled with singing, playing, and dancing not in movies sincewell, maybe ever. Comparisons to 1985's A Chorus Line or 2002's Chicago or even 1933's 42nd Street are inadequate. And to measure the film against 1952's classic Singin' in the Rain, often considered the best musical ever made, is just simply inappropriate.La La Land stands on its own--it is its own unique, exhilarating self. Even for those of us who don't enjoy musicals, La La Land is an inspiration, because more than about art or music or performance, it's about life itself. You think you've had a bad day? Take a look at these poor unfortunate souls as they realize they might have squandered their entire lives on a dream no more substantial than a Land of Lollipops and Cotton Candy, Somewhere Over a Rainbow.Just after the movie screen opens up and widens to reveal the picture will be presented in glorious CinemaScope, the widest and largest film presentation available, and in vibrant and breathtaking Technicolor, the very first scene takes place on a steamy day in a traffic jam outside Los Angeles. One single, frustrated driver exits her car and begins to tentatively sing a song about how she's remaining optimistic despite the misery of the day.That solitary driver is soon joined by another driver, and then another, and another, until moments later the entire freeway is filled with a breathtakingly entertaining musical production piece involving hundreds of drivers, all performing an optimistic song to a driving tempo while displaying spectacular synchronized jumps and whirls and high-steps in a variety of dance styles. It's a tough act to followbut as Al Jolson said in 1927's The Jazz Singer, Hollywood's very first musical, 'You ain't seen nuthin' yet!' Nominally the stars of La La Land are the vibrant and lovely Emma Stone as Mia, an aspiring actress, and the laconic, handsome Ryan Gosling as Sebastian, a jazz pianist performing for tips in a lunchtime restaurant. Stone and Gosling also teamed effectively earlier in their careers, in supporting roles in the 2011 comedy Crazy, Stupid Love, starring Steve Carell and Julianne Moore.In La La Land, Stone's Mia is a young actress toiling as a waitress at an upscale coffee shop. Mia accepts the slights, low tips, and casual cruelties of both customers and co-workers with an indefatigable sense of optimism while religiously attending auditions for acting roles, when she can find them. She believes in her dream, and is aggressively pursuing the opportunity that will vindicate her vision and show that all her effort has been worthwhile.Emma Stone with her luminescent eyes and expressive smile opens her heart, and shares with the audience nuances of every tiny triumph and discouraging failure—her feelings quickly become ours, until we're praying for her success almost as much as she is.Gosling as Sebastian, the jazz pianist, turns in a less effecting performance than Stone, but that might be a subjective point—some viewers simply don't quite comprehend the actor's performance method: Gosling often appears inarticulate, murmuring his dialogue while looking downward or away from the other character, then looking up to assess the impact of his lines, followed by a wistful smile, as if the actor's recalling a sweet memory from long ago. Gosling is effective in his role as Sebastian, but some of that success is earned as a result of the belief Mia places in him—we trust her trust.Both Gosling and Stone, however, dazzle in their musical scenes—their singing and dancing are impressive, and at times exhilarating. The canny viewer will notice, however, that often the dancing is presented in very small segments of two of three seconds duration, edited together to create the illusion of one continuous performance. It's a trick of Tom Cross' expert editing, but it works beautifully: Stone and Gosling are not Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, but watching them dancing together you'll hardly notice the distinction.But the real star of La La Land is writer and director Damien Chazelle, who also delivered the inspiring and challenging Whiplash in 2014. Plainly sufficiently inspired by music to largely build his movies around it, Chazelle is also canny enough to appreciate that the non-musical sequences are equally important to the overall success of the picture. Also enormously impressive is Justin Hurwitz' music—words, lyrics, and orchestrations. If the ballad The Fools Who Dream doesn't draw a tear from the viewer's eye, call a cardiologist, quick. The song is delivered by Stone toward the end of the picture, during the audition that will make or break her career. And the wistful delicacy of Stone's performance of the song nicely summarizes the emotion of every man or woman who knows the feeling of making a decision based on their heart rather than their mind.Plainly, La La Land is a movie made by people who love movies, for people who love movies. Proceed with caution: See this picture only if you want to be moved as deeply as you want to be entertained.",9,3,12,30 January 2017
Don't Breathe," Tension to spare, but nobody to care about
","I don't know whether the remarkable physical resemblance between actor Stephen Lang and horror novelist Stephen King was a factor in Lang's being cast in Don't Breathe, but the similarity provides a nifty extra dimension in a picture with enough plot twists and reversals of fortune to keep the viewer's head spinning for most of its 88-minute running time.In Don't Breathe, three burglars lured into a life of crime by the economic despair of their Detroit environment seek to score one final payday before retirement by pulling a heist on the home of a reclusive military veteran blinded in battle during the Gulf War. That the veteran resides in the solitary home remaining in an otherwise-deserted neighborhood fails to provide a clue to the erstwhile criminal masterminds that their target knows a thing or two about survival.From the looks of the trailer, Don't Breathe appeared to be a fairly interesting variation on the 'Boy, you picked on the wrong guy this time, punk' theme made popular decades ago by actor Charles Bronson and director Michael Winner in Death Wish and its sequels. I was a little confused that what appeared to be an intense urban drama was being marketed to the public as a horror picture, but sometimes a picture needs that extra little oomph to find an audience.Don't Breathe as expected turns fairly quickly into a game of cat and mouse between the sight-impaired quarry and the brain-impaired burglars, with the advantage being switched back-and-forth often enough to make the picture almost resemble a Road Runner cartoon. The problem is that about halfway through the picture the plot takes an absurdly-unexpected turn toward the gamy, and launches Don't Breathe into both another dimension and another genre. From that point on, the picture works hard to earn and maintain its R rating.The ultimate trick played on the audience is that there's really nobody to root for: As in real life, distinctions in morality become blurred---nobody's completely good or completely bad: Even the dog is conflicted. There's tension galore in Don't Breathe, but no emotional investment in the characters...any of them. As a result, I emerged from the screening--maybe escaped would be a more accurate term--feeling a little cheated...and a lot used.Don't Breathe is making money hand-over-fist, so in the final analysis the morality of the piece matters little to the filmmakers and producers.But ultimately, before the end of the picture I found myself rooting for Detroit.",5,7,14,12 September 2016
American Made," Based On A True Story...Not!
","The MPAA should probably consider a 'Whopper Alert' warning for audiences who attend a motion picture prefaced with the phrase 'based on a true story.' And the first movie to feature the designation—in big red letters—should be 'American Made.''American Made' is purportedly the true story of Barry Seal, a onetime TWA pilot who eventually became a minor peripheral player in the Iran- Contra political scandal which plagued the second term of the Ronald Reagan Administration. The picture depicts Seal as an innocent adventurer recruited and co- opted by the CIA to fly clandestine reconnaissance missions over Central America. As Seals' value to the CIA increases, he's asked to become more deeply involved in highly illegal diplomatic interactions.The film shows Seal becoming a courier between the US and Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, transporting weapons to Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras and eventually building an army of Contras training at a secret base in Arkansas. It's only a matter of time before Seal is captured by Columbian drug-lord Pablo Escobar, and compelled to run shipments of cocaine from Medellin to the US. According to 'American Made,' Barry Seal was the Forrest Gump of the Reagan Administration and Iran-Contra. In real life, Barry Seal was a reprobate and career criminal who was sentenced to ten years in a federal penitentiary before avoiding imprisonment by offering to become an informant against Escobar and the Medellin Cartel. The extent of the 'based on a true story' designation is apparently that both the movie and the history books agree that Seal was once a pilot for TWA.You'll never find an entertainer who works harder to please an audience than Tom Cruise. And in 'American Made,' Cruise as Seal is the whole show, a fun-lovin' good ol' boy, a-servin' his country 'Air America'- style, and making a little money in the bargain. And it's astonishing how many audience members—and even film critics—are accepting 'American Made' as a factual account of a confusing time in history. But it just ain't so. Director Doug Liman, who also teamed with Cruise on the well-received 'Edge of Tomorrow' in 2014, excuses 'American Made' as 'a fun lie based on a true story.' And from his perspective, maybe it is.Warner Bros. studios during the 1930s turned this sort of story into an art form, in a series of cautionary tales such as 'Little Caesar,' 'The Public Enemy,' and 'Bullets or Ballots.' And in each of those pictures, the message came through, loud and clear—Crime Doesn't Pay. In 'American Made,' that message is mostly lost in translation. A running gag in the movie is that every time Cruise as Seal leaves home to commit another abomination in the name of Uncle Sam, as a gesture of farewell he drops his pants and bares his butt to his family.And in the end, that's the image we're left with—Tom Cruise, his famously dazzling grin turned away from the camera, mooning the audience in the name of democracy.That's show biz, folks!",6,1,5,9 October 2017
Kong: Skull Island," A Good, Old-Fashioned Monster Movie
","'Kong: Skull Island' reimagines the origins of the title creature, the enormous ape made famous in the legendary 1933 RKO Radio Pictures release 'King Kong'—the biggest classic monster of them all.The new picture, a co-production of Legendary Entertainment and Tencent Pictures released by Warner Brothers, takes place not during the Depression or in the present day but in 1973, during the waning days of the Vietnam War: A crack US Army helicopter squadron is rerouted from their rotation stateside to accompany a government operative and his team of explorers to an mysteriously uncharted island in the South Pacific where, it is whispered, monsters still roam the earth.From that point on, the plot becomes too complicated and convoluted to bear simple description, let alone belief. Suffice to say that 'Kong: Skull Island' gives us a lot so swallow during its 118-minute running time, and does not withstand a great deal of scrutiny. Every time the picture slows down long enough to allow the viewer an opportunity to think, 'Hey, wait a minute' another thunderous action sequence begins and the implausibility of the screenplay goes out the window. But credibility issues aside, the picture goes down fairly easily, thanks largely to an outstanding cast.The commander of the Army helicopter squadron is played by the wonderful Samuel L. Jackson in the inimitable slow-burn, short-fused style familiar to fans of his appearances in the films of director Quentin Tarantino. Plainly Jackson is having the time of his life in his role, and his relish, enthusiasm, and plain enjoyment are infectious—the audience has just as much fun watching him as Jackson has playing the part.The government operative responsible for diverting Jackson's squadron to the island is played in a subdued, thoughtful, and slightly unhinged and obsessive style by John Goodman. Although known primarily for his comic roles, Goodman provides a hint of tragedy to this picture: His character is revealed to have been the solitary survivor of the sinking of a US-owned vessel. The ship was presumed to have been the casualty of other, more natural forces. But Goodman eventually reveals the sinking was actually the result of an attack bywell, something big, and unseen on Earth for millions of years. Looking into his slightly unfocused eyes, we begin to believe him.As a former British Special Forces officer turned mercenary and now working for Goodman as a tracker, Tom Hiddleston adds a note of clipped and efficient authority to the picture. Although Hiddleston gained wide public attention in his recurring role as the villainous Loki in the popular film adaptations of Marvel's 'Thor' and 'Avengers' line of comics, the actor has also gained critical recognition in pictures as diverse as Steven Spielberg's 2011 adaptation of the novel and play 'War Horse' and in Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris.' And as an anti-war photojournalist working to expose the Skull Island mission as a corrupt military operation, last year's Academy Award-winning actress Brie Larson contributes a little gravity to a role which might in other hands have become jokey or cartoonish. While Larson appears in most of the island scenes, her role contains relatively little dialogue. But the actress displays a laconic aura of single-minded competence in a surprisingly unglamorous role. This member of the expedition is decidedly not a damsel in distress—rather, she gives even the US Army members of the expedition a run for their money, with a few lessons in fortitude in the bargain.The versatile and dependable character actor John C. Reilly is also on hand, as an agreeably loopy Army Air Corps pilot shot down in 1944 and stranded Robinson Crusoe-style on Skull Island for the past three decades. In a role originally intended for Michael Keaton, Reilly acts as a sort of tour guide for the others, introducing to the members of the exploration mission the various sights, customs, and monstrous inhabitants of the isolated island.As noted, the 'oh, come on' factor of 'Kong: Skull Island' is high. The screenplay, credited to Dan Gilroy, Max Borenstein, and Derek Connolly, seems to have been a result of marathon caffeine-fueled sessions with the writers trying to top each other in proposing outlandish notions and preposterous situations, an effort matched perfectly by Jordan Vogt-Roberts frenetic, let's-cover-our-tracks style of direction. But to be fair, the audience does not attend a movie such as 'Kong: Skull Island' with an expectation of credibility.Rather, a movie such as this succeeds of fails on its verisimilitude, its special effects. And in 'Kong: Skull Island' those effects are impressive and sometimes breathtaking, if never exactly overwhelming or frightening. The scenes of Kong taking on his various opponents—from the gigantic subterranean Skullcrawlers, to vicious flying pterosaurs, to a squadron of US Army helicopters and loads of napalm—are alone worth the price of admission. And in close-up shots, with the giant ape roaring from the screen, the viewer is not only able to inspect the orthodonture of the monster, but also nearly feel his hot breath blowing in their faces, even without the aid of 3-D glasses.In the original 1933 'King Kong,' the title beast was described as having a size of between forty and fifty feet. In this picture, the ape is considerably larger, in plain anticipation of Kong being matched in future sequels with various other familiar monsters. To be honest, 'Kong: Skull Island' is likely not going to win any major awards for acting, writing, or direction. Movie viewers in the mood for an artistic triumph or a cathartic emotional journey are advised to look elsewhere.But if you're looking for a raucous good time, a place to scratch your itch for a good, old fashioned monster flick, or even in the mood for a visit with a treasured—and very, very large—old friend, 'Kong: Skull Island' is the movie for you.",7,1,4,22 March 2017
Arrival," Arrival is Superb Science Fiction, and More
","Science fiction often works best when used as an allegory or a metaphor, compelling the viewer to become a participant in the story, and to examine his or her own feelings or reactions to the drama on screen or a similar situation which might be occurring in society.In Paramount Pictures' Arrival, released Friday, a linguist and a theoretical physicist are recruited by US military intelligence when twelve interplanetary vehicles appear simultaneously around the world. The objective of the two civilians is to discern the intentions of the alien visitors, in order that the country is able to respond appropriately. The mission becomes even more critical when the other countries hosting the unexpected visitors begin to react to them with hostility.Arrival was adapted by screenwriter Eric Heisserer from author Ted Chiang's award-winning novella Story of Your Life, which successfully interwove sentiment and science fiction with the notion that the course of one's life is pre-determined prior to birth. That Heisserer's previous screen writing credits are mostly in peripheral horror pictures such as Lights Out and entries in the Nightmare on Elm Street and Final Destination canons does not necessarily give the viewer an accurate idea of what to expect from Arrival.Which is to say, the picture works beautifully on all levels. Denis Villeneuve, the director of last year's superb international crime drama Sicario, works with Heisserer to lead the picture with humanity, allowing the science fiction elements to follow in a more effective fashion. Arrival with its complex structure lends credibility to a story which in more sensational hands might've become just another lurid interplanetary shoot-'em-up. As in Chiang's novella, two stories are told simultaneously, but flow together easily and effortlessly to create one large picture.And the picture's casts works with intelligence and a quiet forcefulness to deliver the message. Amy Adams is a remarkably talented actress who always seems to be standing just short of major international superstardom. Usually found delivering rich and credible performances in movies as diverse as American Hustle and Man of Steel, The Muppets and Disney's Enchanted, Adams as the linguist in Arrival delivers an eminently believable performance in a difficult role which might well be her most multi-dimensional and emotionally-invested characterization to date.At the time she's persuaded by the government to help determine the intentions of the visitors, Adams' Dr. Louise Banks is recovering from an acutely vulnerable point in her life, unknowing that the very sensitivity caused by a recent devastating experience will provide the key to her ability to communicate with the visitors.Adams gives persuasive voice to the languages and technical jargon required of the role, but allows her eyes to wordlessly convey a sense of wounded humanity. The viewer feels her emotional pain, and as a result not only wants to see her succeed in her mission, but also is willing to work along with her in order to do so. Intense concentration is required from both the actress and the viewer to realize the picture's considerable impact.Jeremy Renner, an underrated actor often found performing in action adventures and comic book adaptations, contributes a previously untapped dimension of bemused authority to his role. As the theoretical physicist working alongside Adams' linguist to interpret the intentions of the alien visitors, Renner does not simply don a pair of eyeglasses to suggest intelligence. Instead, in a role which might've become cartoonish or showy in less-capable hands, Renner works with quiet determination and sly humor to fashion from his role a characterization as vivid as Heisserer's screenplay allows.Equally persuasive is the always-reliable Forest Whitaker as the US military intelligence colonel who recruits both Adams and Renner to communicate with the otherworldly guests. Whitaker with his sleepy-eyed, good-natured countenance has often during his long career worked successfully as men of conscience struggling to comprehend a difficult situation before erupting into impulsive action.In Arrival Whitaker delivers another such characterization, and more. I found myself wishing Whitaker had more screen time, but such a wish seems to occur every time he appears in a picture. It's difficult to believe Forest Whitaker's been in films long enough to have delivered finely-crafted performances in such motion picture classics as Platoon and The Color of Money, as well as the title roles of Lee Daniels' The Butler, The Last King of Scotland and Clint Eastwood's Bird, the latter two of which earned him Academy Award recognition.Arrival represents the entire array of contributing artists working at peak performance, on all levels. The ultimate messages of the picture—that we're all here to help each other, every experience is a good one, and time is all we have—are a hopeful antidote to the pessimism if our times.Science fiction, when it works well, adapts itself to the age and allows the viewer to interpret the message in his or her own way. The Thing from Another World, It Came from Outer Space and several other alien invasion pictures of the 1950s mirrored the us-versus-them hostility of the post-World War II era. Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956 showed us the futility of McCarthyism and the Communist Witch-Hunt. And television's beloved Star Trek and The Twilight Zone during the 1960s mirrored in any number of episodes the dichotomy of advanced civilization juxtaposed with the intolerance and hostility of the times.It'll be interesting to learn the reaction to Arrival, with its message of cooperation, during a period in time when much of our world seems to be building walls of hostility rather than bridges of communication.",9,5,10,13 November 2016
Mother!," A Polarizing Failure
","Rarely has there been a motion picture as polarizing as 'Mother!' Critics seem to be split almost down the middle in their consensus— about half seem euphoric over the picture, and the other half are furious. Of those critics who endorse 'Mother!' many seem to be leading their defense of the picture with a vague suggestion that they like it because they're really, really smart, and the rest of us in the audience are dumb, dumb, dumb. And cousin, we all know that just ain't the way it is.Of course, it doesn't matter one bit whether the critics love or hate 'Mother!' Plenty of motion pictures open to enormous critical acclaim and still die a slow, painful death at the box office. The difference to a motion picture's success or failure is the audience, the people who pay to see it. Most movie critics approach a picture with the advantage of not having to shell out their own do-re-mi for tickets. Audiences who have to actually reach for their wallets in order to see a movie might—and sometimes do—have a completely different reaction to the picture than the critics. And the audience's reaction to 'Mother!' is historic in its emphasis.CinemaScore, a Las Vegas-based polling service which surveys audience opinion of a motion picture on a scale from A to F based on exit interviews with theater patrons, reports an average audience score of F for 'Mother!' In the history of CinemaScore, no other movie's rating has ever been that low—never, ever, ever.In fairness to 'Mother!' CinemaScore conducted their interviews with movie patrons while they were on their way out of a screening, undoubtedly still furious for having spent a substantial chunk of change on the experience. Had CinemaScore given audience members a day or two to calm down, the grade might have improved to something more like a D, or a D-minus.'Mother!' after 2014's 'Noah,' is writer/director Darren Aronofsky's second whack at rewriting the Bible's Book of Genesis. Some viewers might remember 'Noah' as the movie which revealed that giant three- armed monsters made of rocks did most of the heavy lifting as Noah built the Ark—a point later explained to have been subjective, but was suspected by many observers to have been included in the picture as a means of luring in the 'Transformers' audience.Starring Jennifer Lawrence and Javier Bardem, 'Mother!' nominally depicts the disruption of a married couple's tranquil life when unexpected guests arrive at their home. But actually, 'Mother!' is an allegory—nothing is what it seems. The characters and situations are symbolic, and are designed to illustrate the director's interpretation of events described in the Old Testament. This notion is augmented by the names of the characters—Man, Woman, Him, Oldest Son, Younger Brotherand naturally, Mother.One of the likely problems with the reception is that 'Mother!' has been seemingly marketed as a horror picture, a sort of distaff, opposite version of 1968's 'Rosemary's Baby.' The misleading marketing was an error which 'Mother!' star Jennifer Lawrence took to the television talk show circuit to correct, prior to the picture's release. But instead of clarifying the issue, the infallibly candid Lawrence effectively further obscured the point by acknowledging that she didn't know precisely what 'Mother!' is, except that it's brilliant and intense. During post-premiere interviews, Lawrence even actually seemed acknowledge that 'Mother!' goes at least a little too far.Which might be the understatement of the week. More than a reimagining of the Book of Genesis, 'Mother!' sometimes more closely resembles a reimagining of Edward Albee, and 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf.' And certainly there's no disguising the knowledge that during a week when only two new major motion pictures were released to theaters, 'Mother!' came in third at the box office, and debuted to an audience which by all appearances plainly despised it. Should you decide to attend 'Mother!' be prepared to hate yourself later for having wasted a fistful of dollars, on a movie which probably shouldn't have been made at all.",1,33,58,16 September 2017
The Greatest Showman," Superb Family Entertainment
","Like Johnny Appleseed, Annie Oakley, and possibly Harry Houdini, P.T. Barnum has become less a figure of history than a giant of American popular folklore. And since Barnum himself never pretended to possess more than a passing relationship with the truth, it's richly appropriate that 'The Greatest Showman,' the new movie which uses as its foundation the life of the father of the circus, does not even bother to use the usual opening gambit, 'based on a true story.' Because it rarely is.Instead, before the opening credits even hit the screen the movie throws the audience by the seat of its pants into the most foot-stomping, pulse-pounding, show-stopping entertainment since the circus came to town. The picture grabs the viewer by his nose and doesn't let go from the first frame of film until the last. And after the show is over, the viewer leaves with a song in his heart, a smile on his face, a spring in his step, and a tear in his eye. 'The Greatest Showman' follows the tried-and-true formula of Horatio Alger and dozens of motion pictures biographies, from 'Rhapsody in Blue' to 'Night and Day' to 'Yankee Doodle Dandy': Through hard work and dedication, the hero rises from poverty to the pinnacle of success, falters for a moment, and then through faith and love achieves an even more lofty and soul-satisfying conclusion.But 'The Greatest Showman' continues the hallowed entertainment tradition to the beat of a percussive and pounding drum-driven hip-hop tempo of street music, accompanied by the most jaw-dropping breakdance moves you'll ever see in an ensemble performance. During the opening scene the world explodes into a panorama of vivid colors embracing in its entirety the world of the circus-flying acrobats, prancing horses, fire-breathers, elephants, and clowns. When the song ends, it's all you can do to stop yourself from jumping to your feet to applaud. And then the movie tops itself, over and over and over again.Anyone who's seen Hugh Jackman appearing on an interview show-and he's doing a lot of them in support of this movie-knows that his signature role as the caustic and violent Wolverine in eight 'X-Men' movies are the real stretch for the actor. The very definition of the term 'amiable bloke,' the Australian Jackman at heart is a song-and-dance man. And in 'The Greatest Showman' Jackman proves it-the actor whirls, jumps, kicks, cakewalks, and struts with such loose-limbed dexterity that he often seems immune to laws of gravity. Matching Jackman almost step-by-step, scene-by-scene, and note-by-note are a talented array of supporting performers, including Zac Efron as a highbrow New York playwright persuaded by Barnum to join the circus as a means of broadening the show's appeal, and the platinum-selling pop star Zendaya as the trapeze artist Efron falls for. One highlight among many in the picture is the ballad 'Rewrite the Stars,' performed by Zendaya and Efron in a sort of aerial ballet courting ritual under the big top.Likewise, the exotic Keala Settle, playing the bearded lady among the uniquely-gifted and physically distinctive show people recruited by Barnum to star in his 'Greatest Show,' provides much of the heart and soul of the movie. Settle's performance of 'This is Me' adds real spirit to an anthem for the heartbreaking loneliness of individuality, and the empowerment found in accepting yourself as you are.The gifted Michelle Williams is as adorable as usual as Barnum's patient wife, Charity, and the Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson adds European flavor as opera star Jenny Lind, persuaded by impresario Barnum to undertake a series of US concerts under his tutelage in a bid to gain acceptance among the more rarefied echelons of society.Surprisingly, 'The Greatest Showman' is receiving mixed reviews from some of the country's more influential critics. Some are turning up their collective noses at the movie's 'soupy soulfulness' and shallow, populist aspirations. But the picture in its depiction of the contentious 'friendly enemy' relationship between Barnum and newspaper critic James Gordon Bennett seems to anticipate the unflattering reviews. When Barnum is confronted with the challenge that everything connected with his show is 'fake,' Barnum points to the circus' audience and smilingly replies, 'Those smiles seem real enough.' And you know what? He's right.Written by Jenny Bicks and Bill Condon and guided to the screen by first-time director Michael Gracey, 'The Greatest Showman' steps up to the plate and bats a grand slam home run in just about every single department. And with a dozen or so rousing, showstopping songs courtesy of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the Academy Award-winning lyricists from last year's 'La La Land,' the viewer might even want to stop on the way home after the movie to pick up a copy of the soundtrack album. 'The Greatest Showman' is superb motion picture entertainment in the tradition of the great Hollywood musicals, and as close as we're likely to get to a Broadway experience simulated in a movie auditorium. There's real movie magic at work here: This is one picture packed with an ingredient rarely found in films these days-it's spelled J-O-Y, and it has a big exclamation point at the end. There's a lot of competition out there for your family entertainment dollar during this holiday season. If you can only see one movie this month, 'The Greatest Showman' is the choice you want to make. Any movie which depicts a father riding to his daughter's musical recital on a dancing elephant is doing something awfully right. The highest praise-P.T. Barnum would love this picture. And so will you.",10,1,4,30 December 2017
Life," We've Seen It All Before
","About three quarters of the way through 'Life,' the new science fiction thriller from Skydance Media and Columbia Pictures, one of the characters muses to his colleagues, 'Life's existence requires destruction.' Even as simple pop psychology or a pun, it's a fairly prophetic statement: The character who speaks the line of dialogue has only a few more minutes before being dispatched by an alien in a particularly colorful way, and it occurs at a point in the picture when the audience has mostly given up hope of any sort of conventionally happy ending.Set in more-or-less the present day—one character makes a reference to being a schoolboy at the time of the Challenger tragedy, and the math works out about right—in 'Life,' the six members of the International Space Station crew are tasked with recovering an interstellar probe vessel returning from Mars with a sample of soil.In analyzing the sample, the crew's biologist discovers a dormant single-cell organism, and is able to revive the specimen through the use of scientific stuff. Naturally the organism begins to grow.At first the life form is fairly innocuous, resembling a cutely hungry little dandelion bud. And as news of the extraterrestrial discovery flashes across Earth below, the united schoolchildren of the world vote to name the alien life form 'Calvin.' But it becomes quickly apparent to the members of the space station crew that Calvin isn't as adorable as he seems—the organism continues to grow and grow, and eventually develops an attitude. And as usually occurs in this type of enterprise, the number one item on the alien hit list is people.Screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, who previously teamed on 'Zombieland,' 'Deadpool' and one of the 'G.I. Joe' pictures, acknowledge the influence of 1979's 'Alien' on this picture, although 'Life' actually is more reminiscent of the 1958 picture 'It! The Terror from Beyond Space,' which heavily influenced the filmmakers responsible for 'Alien.' As in the 1958 picture, 'Life' makes a persuasive case for the future inclusion of flamethrowers among the other tools routinely assigned to astronauts.But Swedish filmmaker Daniel Espinosa, who previously directed 'Safe House' in 2012, is also plainly influenced by Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' in portentousness if not cinematic quality. The major problem with 'Life' is that nobody involved seems to be able to decide whether the picture is science fiction or horror, so they try to cover all the bases.The cast of the picture seems to be game enough to play along. Actor Jake Gyllenhaal stars as the space station's melancholy physician, Dr. David Jordan. Jordan has been on the space station continuously longer than any previous astronaut, at least long enough for his muscles to have begun to atrophy.Jordan explains to a sympathetic colleague that he prefers space to life on Earth because of the relative peace. But as Calvin continues to grow in both size and hostility, Jordan must begin to rethink the notion, no matter what might be going on below.Swedish actress Rebecca Ferguson, recently of the latest entry of the 'Mission: Impossible' film franchise and 'The Girl on the Train,' appears as the space station's quarantine officer Miranda North. North is continually attempting to isolate Calvin to one part of the station, but is usually about one step behind and one or two seconds too slow. Quarantine becomes a major dilemma in 'Life,' and finally explains to everybody's satisfaction the reason the original Apollo astronauts were sequestered for weeks following their return from the moon in 1969, a precaution many at the time thought preposterous.And the genial, benign Ryan Reynolds, quickly emerging as a major Hollywood star, appears as the space station's selfless engineer and chief problem-solver, Roy Adams. Reynolds also seems to have been something of the catalyst behind the project: He's the solitary member of the cast to have previously worked with many of the picture's production team: 'Life' screenwriters Rhett Reese and Paul Warnick also adapted Reynolds' breakthrough hit, last year's 'Deadpool,' and the actor costarred with actor Denzel Washington in 'Safe House,' director Espinoza's previous English language picture.All hands onboard seem to be enjoying themselves as actors scooting themselves weightlessly through the various corridors of the space stationand frequently slamming hatches behind them in an effort to escape becoming a quick lunch for their Martian guest.'Life' ultimately works better as horror than as science fiction, and the picture is rated R for enough space carnage to almost be called 'Close Encounters of the Lurid Kind.' In fact, the picture has a little fun at the expense of Steven Spielberg's 1977 classic science fiction drama by satirizing that film's famed advertising slogan, 'We Are Not Alone,' with their own posters, which read 'We Were Better Off Alone.'Unfortunately, there's no such humor in the picture itself, with the possible exception of keen-eyed viewers perhaps noticing that the alien as it grows begins to resemble H.G. Wells' description of the invading Martians in his 1897 novel 'The War of the Worlds.' Otherwise, this is not a happy movie. 'Life' takes a page from Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' playbook by killing off one of its major stars in the second reel, and also leaves the door wide open for a sequel. And the picture's finale is genuinely nightmarish, although you'll probably figure out where the movie is heading a good five minutes before it arrives there.But as these movies go, 'Life' at 111 minutes has good production values, state of the art visual effects, and persuasive performances. It's not a bad picture, just an awfully messy one. And if the movie is not the classic of the horror or science fiction genres you were hoping for well, that's 'Life.'",6,3,7,29 March 2017
