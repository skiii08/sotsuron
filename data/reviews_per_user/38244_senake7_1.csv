Iron Man 3," Does brilliantly for an evolving story
","In my opinion, I felt that Iron Man 1 had both innovation and as an engineer, even potentially inspiring educational value on it's side. Iron Man 2 also had a way of communicating the the potential positive and negative impact of technological innovation....then it all came crashing down with the Avengers movies which seemed to me to comprise mainly of fight scenes and CGI.Iron Man 3 has reintroduced the tech innovation albeit mainly in a bio-tech/genetic instead of an electro-mechanical context. As a innovatively minded engineer who has pitched my fair share, of (high and low quality) innovations, it's good to see the standpoint of take-it-or- leave-it-investor and desperate-tech-entrepreneur represented too! I can see why some are saying that the plot is disjointed, but it is in fact quite the opposite. None of the technology is introduced for frivolous reasons and the film surprises on quite few occasions.Not as easy to watch film as 1 or 2, but thought provoking nonetheless.",8,2,10,27 April 2013
