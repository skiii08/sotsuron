Vertigo," the splendor of a genius
","I think that this movie has been one of the most masterpiece of every time. Mr Hitchcock overcomes himself in a visionary thriller full of memorable sequences. Surely, the most impressive and artistically scene is that of the James Stewart's dream.......a bad dream. Every time I see it I remain chill because it shoot the spectator and as like a painter Mr Hitchcock draw every scene in majestic way. To remember the chilling 'false' look of MRS Kim Novak and her various classic wearing. I considered this movie the best of all played by hitch although the unreal story.CARMINE TUF............",10,2,4,9 August 2005
