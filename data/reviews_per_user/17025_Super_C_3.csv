The Ring," Can't... Sleep...
","This movie was like nothing I have ever seen.  I am rarely scared by movies and when I am, it's usually a minor, fleeting sort of fear.  'Signs' did it a little, and maybe 'What Lies Beneath' a bit - but I have never been scared by a movie like I was by this.  It's been a week since I've seen it and I'm still having problems getting to sleep.  And, if I wake up in the middle of the night, I just lay in fear until morning, occasionally (and reluctantly) glancing at the TV in my bedroom.  When they play the commercials on TV, I get the chills.  I can't decide if I love this movie, or dread it.  Both, I think.",10,0,0,24 October 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Fantastic
","I went into the theater with high expectations for this movie and I was not disappointed.  I was concerned that the story wouldn't be maintained and instead, all of the creative energy might only be directed to visual effects.  While a lot certainly went into the later, the former was, thankfully, not neglected.  This movie answers questions I didn't even know existed and gave me that same excited feeling I remember experiencing when I originally discovered what the matrix actually is.As for the effects... 'whoa'.  I actually had to make a conscious effort to restrain the urge to break out in applause in the middle of the movie. Quite simply: I've never seen anything come close.  I was nothing short of astounded.The Matrix Reloaded did the first movie justice, and then some.",10,0,0,15 May 2003
The Matrix," A really outstanding movie with an extremely original, twisting plot. I give it a 9/10.
","My opinion: I absolutely love it.My reasoning: Outstanding plot - This brilliant plot keeps your eyes and mind glued to the movie for the entire 2+ hours.  It's a really great (if not mind-bending) feeling when your brain puts two and two together and you discover what the matrix really is (a short time before the actual explanation).Outstanding visual/special effects - Filming styles never-before-seen in a movie, seamless CG constituents, and outstanding 'classical' special effects add a tremendous amount of eye-candy to an already great movie.Good music/sound effects - The music's very well-done (not quite 'great' but close).  The sound effects are great and, at times, quite innovative (the metallic distortion of Neo's screams, for instance).Overall, it's a really outstanding movie with an extremely original, twisting plot that really keeps you guessing and continues to make you think long after the movie is over.  It's a bit on the cerebral side so people who just like pure action and no thought may not be completely impressed (more than likely, you'll at least like it, however).  It will definitely appeal to geeks (like myself).  There may be a few slightly, over-dramatic shots, not bad - but made me chuckle a couple of times (usually facial expressions by Keanu).  Believe it or not, Keanu Reeves actually does a decent job (could've been better, but definitely the best he's ever done).  I saw it multiple times in the theater (very rare) and also bought the DVD (a very good disc with a lot of features - BTW).  I give it a very enthusiastic 9/10.",10,0,0,11 October 1999
