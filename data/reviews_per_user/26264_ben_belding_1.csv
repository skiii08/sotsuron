Requiem for a Dream," Left me feeling pretty emotionally drained...
","'Requiem for a Dream' follows several characters as their lives are gradually ruined by drugs. Maybe not such an unusual subject for a film, but unlike most other films of this type, Requiem is truly shocking.There are many films I have enjoyed far more than Requiem for a Dream (most with much lower IMDB ratings) however few films have managed to leave me so emotionally drained, especially after the film's disorienting cinematography and nightmareish climax. Whether that makes it a great film or not, i'm not sure...",Null,0,0,15 February 2003
