Black Swan," A beautiful and clever masterpiece
","I tried to find a reason to give this film anything less than a full 10, but failed. We must celebrate the making of films like Black Swan.The drama revolves around the young ballet dancer Nina (Portman). Through her, we are invited to follow the physically and mentally trying life of a professional dancer, through repetitions, auditions and - finally - performance. The director and the cinematographer very cleverly brings us close to Nina - both emotionally and visually. (The cinematography is in itself a worthwhile reason to watch this movie.)This closeness is sustained throughout the film, keeping the audience on their toes as the plot unfolds - never really knowing what to expect. The psychological credibility of the characters furthermore makes it almost impossible not to be drawn into the drama.Those things would not have been possible, however, without nothing less than outstanding acting on all parts. Reading about Portman's preparation for the role just confirms the feeling you get when watching the film - that this is a work of great skill, professionalism and passion.Last but not least the beautiful soundtrack of the film is worth mentioning. It is - of course - Tchaikovsky's original music, which has been altered to some degree to fit the feature, albeit in a clever, tasteful and unobtrusive way.I highly recommend this beautiful and intelligent film.",10,2,5,29 January 2011
