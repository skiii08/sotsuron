Angels & Demons," Very good but too much of the novel was removed
","I must say that I liked this movie. I liked the book also. I thought the book was better than the Da Vinci code with one exception. Silas was a much more interesting antagonist than the assassin in Angels & Demons. To follow the story of Silas was very interesting, I thought.Back to this movie, I thought the changes made was justified and made sense in the movie. One element that I sorely missed was one of the major motives of the main villain. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book please read no further and skip to the next paragraph. I missed that the camerlengo was the pope's son, and that the camerlengo's misunderstanding that the pope had fathered a child through sex was truly sacrilege and his big motivation for doing what he did. The camerlengo's appearance as a Christ figure after the antimatter annihilates was also something that I missed.Spoiler over. It was great to see all the sights in Rome, having previously been there last year on vacation. But I wished that Howard would slow down a little in his pacing of the movie so the movie wouldn't go by so fast. So despite the changes made and the things that I missed I thought it was a excellent movie that was well written and well executed. A movie that I will definitely see again, probably twice.",5,1,1,22 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good science fiction movie, but no Star Wars movie
","I have seen this movie seven times now, once at the theater and six times on Laserdisc, and I really must say that this is a great science fiction movie. But nothing else. To call this a Star Wars movies is a almost a mock on the original trilogy, which I have seen about 30 times each now. It has none of the magical storytelling that the other movies have.Like I wrote earlier, it is a great science fiction movie. It has a good story with magnificent special effects to back the story up.I think that it was a GREAT mistake to take the Jar-Jar Binks character to such lengths. I didn't find any of his so-called comic releaf the least funny. What I found the funniest thing about the movie was, once again, C-3PO. Especially when 3PO introduces himself to R2, when he says 'What do you mean naked?' and then 'My parts are showing?'. I found that very funny indeed.Something that I don't understand though is why did Jar-Jar go with Qui-Gon and Padme (Queen Amidala in disguise) to the city on Tatooine. Jar-Jar is a creature that is used to and lives in a very wet enviroment. Since his people live in the underwater city. Wouldn't it almost be torture for a creature like that outside in a desert enviroment like Tatooine? I guess he just came along to act as further comic releaf.I sincerely hope that Lucas ditches that character unless he will have some function for the story. I would think that Jar-Jar only has a function in this movie when the action takes place around the plant Naboo. He did have a function to bring the Naboo and Gungan peoples together to defeat the trade federation. But other than that was he just a nuisance.It didn't make me feel the same way as the original films did. None of the awe and wonder we saw in the first movies with colorful characters like Han Solo, Darth Vader, Yoda (who only has a minor function here), Governor Tarkin, Jabba the Hut, Boba Fett. And with wonderful ship designs like the Millenium Falcon, the Death Stars, Tie Fighters, Tie Bomber, Darth Vader's Tie Fighter, Darth Vader's flagship in The Empire Strikes Back, Cloud City. I guess the lists are endless. I didn't find any of this in this film. The ship that Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, the queen and everyone else traveled in was obviously a computer generated ship. It didn't even have a scratch after being shot at by the blockade.I found that the actor who did the best work here was Ian McDiarmid who played Senator Palpatine and Lord Sideous, I suspect. I found this to be the case when I noticed the music after the forth time. Every time Lord Sideous appeared, the Emperor theme heard in Return of the Jedi is played. And since we all know that Senator Palpatine became the Emperor later in the story, we must assume that Senator Palpatine is Lord Sideous. He is obiously acting like he is very protective of his queen, but very discretly and with much finess manipulates the queen when she is on Coruscant.
There is also another wonderful scene when Anakin says goodbye to his mother. That is a heartbreaking scene with Anakin showing his reasons for becomming Darth Vader later in the story, his fears that he won't see his mother again. It is my suspiction that the Emperor/Senator Palpatine works on this in addition to his love for queen Amidala to make him give in and become his evil apprentice and work with him to eliminate almost every Jedi.I have been writing enough now. But I must say again that is a good movie on it's own. But if you have been raised on Star Wars, like I have, I think you will find out that it is nothing compared to the original films.",3,0,1,2 May 2000
Citizen Kane," Without a doubt THE greatest motion picture ever
","When I got the CAV Criterion Laserdisc version of this movie, I didn't have any expectations what so ever. When the movie was over, I was so tranced and entoxicated that I couldn't believe what I had just seen.What I noticed the most was the photography. The gorgeous black & white photography by Gregg Toland. The music by Bernard Herrmann was also something that I noticed.Having only seen Orson Welles in 'The Man Who Saw Tomorrow' before, I was excited to see such a young man in the title role, making his feature film debut with such tremendous energy and wonderful acting. I said to myself, 'How can a man so young make something like this?'. Welles, only 26 at the time, showed such understanding of the motion picture and how to make so something beautiful, funny, exciting and terrible. How could such a genius become such an outcast of Hollywood.Even 17 years later in 'Touch of Evil', hadn't he lost any of his touch of how to make something extraordinary. Like Martin Scorsese, 'Citizen Kane that makes you believe that anything is possible on film'.This is truly a motion picture that will be the greatest of all of motion picture for another 50 years. It will be the crowning and the most tragic achievement in the history of the motion picture. The crowning achievement because of the film's quality and groundbreaking means to achieve it. And the most tragic because of the way Orson Welles was welcomed into Hollywood. But we can thank God that at least one film of Welles' best was untouched by the shortsightness of the studios.If you like to see a wonderful movies with a tragic, funny story and gorgous photography, go and see this fantastic film",10,5,9,3 December 1999
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Quite overrated
","I am so glad that I didn't buy this movie on Blu-ray when it first came out even though I am a fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. I saw it first on Canal Plus Film HD in really good picture and OK sound. The movie looks great with the normal dark Burton atmosphere. I love the old musicals with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly, and all the other great musical stars of the golden age of the Hollywood musical motion picture in the 40s and 50s. But I really don't like the modern musicals like Hairspray, Chicago and this movie. This movie is the best of them all because of Burton's handling of the story and his sets looking like sets. I really don't like these movies with people singing and dancing in the middle of city that is filmed in the city. There are exceptions, of course, like 'West Side Story' and 'On The Town'. Musicals are not meant to be realistic. You can see that in all the great Arthur Freed musicals. But every musical now has people singing and dancing on location in the big city which looks so stupid. This is where this movie towers above them all. But what I don't like about this movie is the mediocre singing of all the actors. Why not have really great singing actors do the parts? There are so many really great singing actors that could have made a name for themselves in the movies and the studio could have more stars to build up and make money of. Instead Warners and Burton chose to have very well known actors sing badly. The songs were really good and really well integrated into the plot. I never felt like the story stopped when they burst out in song. But you need people that can sing or else everything falls apart. The producers and Burton should have made the same decision that the producers and director of 'My Fair Lady' did when they decided to dub Audrey Hepburn in the singing because they felt that Hepburn didn't have the voice necessary. I have heard the temp track of Hepburn singing one of the songs and she sounded better than either Helena Bonham Carter or Johnny Depp. She was even musical. Carter and Depp were not.Being such a fan of both Burton and Depp I was very disappointed and I was very glad that I didn't buy the movie. Since the singing was such an integral part of the movie it ruined the whole experience of what could have been a really great movie.",4,0,1,8 June 2009
The Passion of Joan of Arc," The greatest piece of film before Citizen Kane
","I saw it at Cinemateket in Oslo once and I was so captivated by the film that I was stunned for days after I saw it. I saw it with no background music, but when I saw it, I didn't even notice that. The camera work was SO tremendously magnificent, the cutting so exciting and the acting so good, that it passes Sunrise as my favorite silent film, which also made a tremendous impact on me. The extreme close-ups of the faces in the courtroom, the cutting during the torture scene are just two of my personal favorite things about this movie Falconetti's portrait of the french heroine was some of the most wonderful acting in a silent film I've ever seen. It even compares to the great Lillian Gish. I haven't been able to get it on Laserdisc or DVD yet though, but I hope it will be issued.",10,6,10,30 April 1999
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," It could be great but became so bad
","I thought this movie was so bad, much like Jackson's King Kong was really bad. It was SO overlong that I sat in the movie theater and pondered when it would end. I will most certainly NOT see the rest of series. I know that if Jackson had followed the book (with some adaptation changes to keep the continuity with LOTR in check, like the Rivendell sequence) and made a two hour movie adaptation I would be very happy. Considering that the original book wasn't a great masterpiece like LOTR was a single movie would be the best. It seems like that Jackson was SO preoccupied with subplots that he lost his way with the main plot (again like with King Kong). This was simply a bad overlong movie made by a now very pretentious film maker.",2,13,22,20 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Laughably bad writing, direction and acting
","I was hoping for a grand end of the prequel trilogy of my favorite movies when I was growing up. I still remember being a 10 year old kid sitting in the Colosseum movie theater in Oslo being totally at awe in watching Return of the Jedi back in 1983. It has always been the greatest movie experience of my life and it always will be. I now think that Empire is even better (I was too young to see it in 1980) and have bought the original trilogy on VHS, Laserdisc and DVD (and I will buy them when they come to Blu-ray). This prequel trilogy was just such a waste. All the talent in front of and behind the camera, except Lucas, was wasted on these movies. I have written a review on the first prequel movie and I must say now that I feel even worse about it, episode 2 and this movie. I have seen all three of the prequel movies several times now and I must say that they contain so much clichés that it is almost frightening. I cannot say how many times I cringe when I see these horrors that are disguised as Star Wars movies. When I see the pod race in the first movie I keep thinking that I am seeing a sort of desert live-action Wipe-Out race.But I will keep my comments to this movie. All aspects of the movie are such drivel. The worst things are the script and the direction, both by Lucas. The last movie George Lucas directed before episode 1 is the 1977 Star Wars. That's over 20 years of not directing any movie. His third time around he is still bad. It seems like the movie is all over the place. I read another review on this site and he was totally right when he wrote that the wipes were all over the place. This bad editing is the result of a bad script that needed trimming and believability. Not to mention the truly horrible dialog.What everyone was waiting for, Anakin's seduction into the dark side, was done so badly. Hayden Christensen's ham acting didn't help, but with a superior director (basically any of Hollywood's good directors would do a better job) the acting could have been improved on. When Anakin kills Count Dooku in the beginning of the movie I keep thinking 'That's it? No more remorse about killing another human being in cold blood?'. We see no conscience at work at all. Anakin's seduction by Palpatine to the dark side is also very unbelievably done. When Anakin cuts off Windu's arm Palpatine screams 'Power! Unlimited power!!' and throws lightning at him so he is thrown far into the city. Can't Anakin see him for what he is, a manipulative, deceitful evil man that is behind everything that has transpired all his life? No. All he says is 'What have I done?'. Everything Palpatine has been pretending to care about has been a lie. His mentor is the very evil he has been fighting all his life. Does he reject him because of this? No. OK. He wants to save Padme's life, but how can he know that this ability about saving people from death wasn't a lie too? The transformation from good to bad is done so badly. It was very cool to hear the great James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader when he put on the famous suit, but I cringed at the the dialog spoken. The romance between Anakin and Padme is also handled like a bad high school play with acting and dialog to match. The technical side of the movie is second to none. The effects and sound design are really great. When I was a teenager I kept thinking about how Anakin Skywalker had turned to evil since he was really a good person. How can a good person willingly do all these terrible things? He was my favorite villain of all and he still is. I think I have to pretend like these horrible prequel movies never was made. I just hope that the original trilogy will appear on Blu-ray in their original incarnations and not with all the out-of-place digital CGI work what were inserted into the movies back in 1997. This movie was just a letdown that I think it is better to think that it and the two previous movies weren't made at all.",5,10,19,24 October 2008
The Wolverine," What a mess!
","I have just seen this for the second time in the hope of it making more sense the second time around. It does not.I tried to view it like one of characters wasn't quite what he/she appeared to be, but it didn't help. The plot of this is drivel from about 20% into it. The first 20% was interesting where we just saw Logan coping with what happened and what he did in X-men 3. When he arrives in Japan the movie bogs down to drivel. It has action sequences that doesn't make sense with uninteresting people. There is one exception to this. One character is interesting, Yukio. She is the only one that displays any real sense of having a past, and being a real character with her own emotions and sense of self. The plot doesn't make any sense what so ever, even the second time watching it. So when the movie moves towards the climax of the story it so uninteresting that I was about to sleep. And by the time the main bad guy has the final showdown with Wolverine it is very predictable how this is going to end.Actually the most interesting scene in the entire movie is at the very end, after the main plot has been concluded, when we see a couple of familiar characters from previous X-men movies in an airport. This little scene has more fire and more character that it seems to be written and directed by other people than the movie proper.I would most definitely say that this is the worst of the X-men movies. Even Origins: Wolverine is better than this. With the other Marvel movies, like Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man, and DC's Dark Knight Trilogy we know by now that superhero movies can be really great.I would not recommend anyone watching this piece of nonsense.",2,6,13,5 August 2013
Contact," One of the very best science fiction movies of the 90's
","When I first saw Contact, I breathed a breath and thought that finally did they make a very interresting sci-fi movie with real people and with a story that makes so much more sense than all those other stupid sci-fi movies out there nowadays, like Independance Day.An alien civilization contacts earth and instructs us how to build an interstellar transport device, so that we can come to them. It is a very original idea. We meet Ellie (Jodie Foster) who dreams of reaching the stars all her life, motivated by the loss of her mother and later her father. We see how her obsession almost destroys her when all her wishes and dreams become real. There is life out there.Then the film take a dramatic turn and all the world is presented. We see the American government trying to make it a matter that is better to be classified for national security (I almost laughed when I heard that). There are the religious fanatics that say that Jesus has returned and other religious fanatics saying that the Devil is tempting us with this. There is even a group of new nazis that's screaming that Hitler is alive, because of the signal containing the plans to the transport device was transmitted with the television transmission from the 1936 olympic games when was Hitler making his speech.The movie so expertly realizes the social hysteria created by contact other than us. Both from the scientists, who say that we should examine the unknown, and other people, who say that we should leave the unknown alone.And finally there is the ultra rich person (John Hurt) who can have transmitted and made all this happen just for his personal amusement.There is so much going on in this movie. The special effect are so subtly inserted into it that we hardly notice them until at the end. I especially love the effect when young Ellie runs for the medicine cabinet after her father has collapsed. We hardly notice it, because it so subtle and we are so involved in the story and the character. That is what special effects is supposed to do, in my opinion. Not have a bunch of stuff that are obviously effects and have a thin story around it. The effects are supposed to help and assist the story and character, not the other way around.When the movie ended I was left thinking of how magnificent this movie was. It had almost the same effect as 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' and 'Metropolis' (although very different films).",Null,3,7,14 June 2000
