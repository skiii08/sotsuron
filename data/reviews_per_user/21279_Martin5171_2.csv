Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Star Wars is finally back!
","I will not give away any spoilers about the important plot points and events but I still like to warn those who wish to know nothing. If that is the case I will start by saying this:If you like Star Wars, see this movie! If you hated the prequels, you have nothing to fear ... only enjoyment can be found in this film. If you love 'A New Hope' and 'The Empire Strikes Back', then you will love this one as well!Now onwards for a bit more info and what I think of it in more detail.Star Wars: The Force Awakens is directed by J.J Abrams and it is a perfect sequel to Return of the Jedi and the original trilogy in general. The movie is fast pasted, full of great action, lots of practical effects, good acting, beautiful music by John Williams and it is a fun ride with a lot of funny moment! Its a mix of nostalgia, enough fan service together with many feelings of 'new' alongside with the new young cast. The story is NOT original, feels more like a mash up between Episode IV and Episode V ..... But it works since it is the first in this new trilogy. I have my hopes up for a way more original story with the upcoming two other films.The films flaws is in its lacking story, trademark J.J Abrams by now (!) and its bad handling of two certain movie characters in two different type of ways (of which I have no need to go in further too). However whomever gets fixated with these MINOR things and draw the conclusion that the movie would be bad or even suck .... they have obviously fallen to the dark side. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is a great movie, a lot of fun and a perfect sequel and restart to the Star Wars saga. Will be catching the next screening tomorrow already, this is a film I can re-watch plenty of times!*And as many others have stated, this is at least the third best Star Wars movie ever made.*",7,11,30,16 December 2015
