Marie Antoinette," Being Marie Antoinette
","Upon reading all the terrible comments about this movie, even though I am an admirer of Sofia Coppola's work, I had a strong fear that I would get disappointed with it. But, I was wrong! It was beautiful, everything was so pure and realistic. A great art work combined with great directing! I entered through a door and landed in Marie Antoinette's head, where I was able to see the world through her eyes. After 123 minutes, instead of being dropped into a ditch beside the New Jersey Turnpike, I was sitting in a movie theater with 100 other people who were fascinated with what they just had experienced.The story is about a little girl who is traded by her family as a merchandise to the French and has to spent the rest of her life living imprisoned in Versailles. She is forced to give up almost every right of choice and live by third party instructions. She has some never fulfilled slots in her heart, such as joy, sex and love. As a young woman she will seek ways in the boring every day life to forget about her pain, loneliness and seek proof of her existence.This is an intelligently depicted story, which will reflect Marie Antoinette's world in your current being. The point is definitely not, if she was good or bad, shallow or deep, if you are still discussing about that, then for sure you didn't get anything about the movie. Maybe you should stop watching Sofia Coppola movies. Only thing that matters here is what she had to live through and how these affected her feelings. If you are expecting to see a historical movie then don't watch it, but if you want to watch the story, of an innocent girl in the cruel world, with punk rock vibes, pink cakes, manolas and champagne, this is the right address, enjoy!",8,8,15,22 October 2006
