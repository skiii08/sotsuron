Antz," Amazing effects take a passenger seat to a good story
","A great movie, amazing CGI effects. It ups the ant on how well actors are integrated with their CGI counterparts. The story is quite good - the best I've seen from DREAMWORKS, and on par with TOY STORY. Let's hope A BUG'S LIFE, which I've been waiting a long time for, and which supposedly has its heart in a better place, does as well.",8,0,0,4 October 1998
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It has that STAR WARS feeling!
","I was afraid TPM would fail to capture the same feeling of exotic place and time that has spanned galaxies and lodged itself so firmly in our imaginations - but I was wrong!The story was very STAR WARS, better than Return of The Jedi, but not as good as EMPIRE or STAR WARS. The effects, in quantity and for the most part quality, were far beyond any blockbuster ever. And there were several key surprises, too!Altogether, ignore the critics and believe (most of) the hype!I'm giving this movie two body parts up (my thumbs, my thumbs!)>",10,0,0,19 May 1999
Unbreakable," Not the Sixth Sense, but a groundbreaking, down-to-earth new approach to superhero mythology
","Go see it. Do not expect 'The Sixth Sense 2'. It's slow for the first two-thirds (but still interesting), and the last third brings it all together with a surprise ending that will make you want to watch it again form the start. The more I think about it, the more I really, really like it.",10,0,0,24 November 2000
Fight Club," An intensely hip psychological trip of violent, 'revolutionary' ideas
","An intense film filled with disturbing, hip, and provocative scenes of violence, nihilism, and anarchy, FIGHT CLUB will almost certainly appeal to men more than women. Nevertheless, it presents a compellingly primitive imperative (and philosophy) in the character of Tyler Durden, whom we find charming despite his extremism. It also presents a few twists and turns in a cleverly written script which addresses the valuelessness and sense of dispossession felt by the unfortunate generation categorized as 'X'. Two thumbs way up for director FINCHER, and everyone in the film.",9,0,1,21 October 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Totally redeems the franchise after MENACE !!!
","I thought it was amazing! The sheer spectacle, it's like they filmed a documentary about the rise of an empire in another galaxy! Sure, there's some wooden lines and cliches, but if you can't get excited about some of the scenes in this movie, you are not there to see a STAR WARS picture! Spiderman (who I always liked) eat your heart out !",10,0,0,16 May 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," The thinking-man's eye candy
","Matrix Reloaded enhances and develops the Matrix lore and universe, both in terms of effects and storyline. The heavy and long philosophical discussions may not be for all viewers (and the do go on a tad too long), but respect the intelligence of the audience as a whole. The slow first third is forgiven once the car chase starts, and the awesome visuals and unpredictable plotline heads in an engaging and entertaining direction - literally leaving you hanging, waiting for the next installment. Cool!",9,0,0,15 May 2003
The Iron Giant," It made me feel like an imaginative little boy again
","It made me feel like a boy again. I loved the wonder of the film, the look, the animation, and the message. It's nice to see an animated film that is both adult and yet still enjoyable by children (as well as the kid in every adult!)I'm going to buy the book and track down the Pete Townsend musical, too. Thoroughly recommended!",9,1,1,30 August 1999
