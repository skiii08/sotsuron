50 First Dates," Great flick.
","This movie conveys all that love should be. This is a fun movie that is about love, laughter and the first kiss. It is something that couples everywhere should watch. Adam Sandler has never been more attractive. Drew barrymore has never seem more innocent. She reminds me of a child who is experienceing love and life for the first time. It is of course a humurous movie. I mean c'mon Adam Sandler, Drew Barrymore, and Rob Schneider. Of course it's funny. I suggest this movie if your looking to just kick back, relax, be entertained, and find a new way to love.",10,0,0,24 February 2004
