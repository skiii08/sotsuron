The Ring," A Successful Remake....again!!!
","The idiots who merchandised for this film conveniently forgot to tell anybody that there was actually a film called Ringu, in Japn, long before the Ring was a thought. Much scarier, atmospheric, and interesting for me. The Ring has been a success in the US, and people keep saying, 'It was so scary!', and 'How did they come up with such a great idea?'. In reality, the people at Dreamworks had no idea where to get a new idea for a movie, so they ripped off an excellent Japense smash hit and repeated the success. Unfairly, in my opinion. People should remember the original film, because the story, atmosphere, and tension was ten times greater than this crap. 2/10 :)",2,1,2,18 January 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," the best movie of all time!!!!
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is easily my favorite film of all time. The special FX, the acting, the musicÂ…almost everything was superb. I only had a major problem with Michael Gambon, who plays Dumbledore. His interpretation of Dumbledore is appalling; he is just a headmaster, and almost violent (like when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire), he's not the Dumbledore that Richard Harris was. If I had my way, Gambon would be sacked immediately. He actually said in an interview that he hasn't read the books, and he has no interest; he just reads the script and does what he's told; there's no interpretation. Basically, he's just in it for the money; people like that shouldn't acting, because acting is interpreting something to make it your own performance. But enough about Gambon; the rest of the movie was terrific. Patrick Doyle wrote one of the best musical scores I've ever heard. Mike Newell took Steve Kloves's screenplay and worked wonders with it; he is the first actually accomplished director this series has seen, and it shows. The FX were wonderful, good enough to rival those in King Kong. The acting was superb, ten times better than in Prisoner of Azkaban. Rupet Grint and Emma Watson were great, even better than in the first three films. Brendan Gleeson was perfect as the eccentric Mad-Eye Moody; David Tenant was excellent as Barty Crouch Jr. Alan Rickman, as Snape, was great, as always. Jason Issacs was excellent, as he always is, as Lucius Malfoy. Katie Leung was great as Cho; Miranda Richardson was hilarious as Rita Skeeter; and sadly, we see very, very little of Gary Oldman, who was great in Prisoner of Azkaban. But my favorite performances were by Timothy Spall, as Wormtail (perfect choice!), Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory (he was charming, and handsome, and it was heart breaking to see him die near the end of the film!). Daniel Radcliffe, who actually had himself cry to film the heartbreaking scene when Cedric's body is brought back to Hogwarts, was superb. His acting has improved so much over the years; he was absolutely amazing. But, as much as I loved Daniel Radcliffe's performance, the performance that stole the movie, and, in my opinion, the greatest performance by any actor, of all time, was Ralph Fiennes as the evil Lord Voldemort. The makeup and digital effects combined with Fiennes's sinister performance made the graveyard scene absolutely terrifying for me to sit through; he was better here than even in Schindler's List! If any actor deserves an Oscar for best actor, it would have to be Ralph Fiennes (unfortunately, the snobs at Hollywood fail to acknowledge true magic like the entity that is Ralph Fiennes these days). Forget about Brokeback Mountain; Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best movie of the year.",10,0,0,16 January 2006
