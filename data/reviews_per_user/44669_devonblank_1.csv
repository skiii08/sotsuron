Captain Phillips," Increased respect for actor already at the top
","I came into the film having only seen Hanks in the Toy Story series and Forrest Gump (you could say I'm sheltered when it comes to watching films). My respect goes even further for Tom Hanks after watching this film considering that Forrest Gump is my favourite of all time.Captain Phillips is thrilling, emotive and leaves you gripping the seat as if on a boat on the cusp of a wave. Hanks is exposed to give a very 'naked' performance - the camera is nearly always in his face and in saying that this film certainly isn't for the faint-hearted. The Somali pirates recruited for the film were particularly impressive given their limited (if any) acting experience, as well as the music which, if repetitive at times, added to the tension. I urge you to watch this film as it will almost certainly be either your favourite Tom Hanks film or your film of the year. I would also recommend being in close proximity to a bar as a stiff drink will be required to wind down.",10,1,3,26 October 2013
