Hereditary," Evil, Terrifying and Absolutely Brilliant
","This... this is special. One of the best female performances I've ever seen in my life from the highly skilled Toni Collette. Her performance took my breath away. The performances are really grounded in a realistic way, which makes the whole crazy premise so much more believable. I'll never forget this movie for as long as I live. This seriously is this century's Exorcist. I actually pity the people that could not find a way to appreciate this masterclass.",10,2,6,6 October 2019
