Casablanca," Casablanca is a well written romantic drama
","Casablanca is a film that goes much deeper than suspected. The world history behind the story is fascinating! Humphrey Bogart does a great job, he captures the surprise along with the resentment upon meeting his past lover played by Ingrid Bergman. The films themes are very patriotic and romantic. The tension between the waring parties makes for great scenes like the battle of the national anthems between the German soldiers and the French people living in Casablanca. The photography is dark and brooding. The lamps within the club cast fantastic shadows across the walls. Casablanca is a romantic classic that stands the test of time.",8,1,2,7 May 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Family Values at Their Best
","John Ford examines the plight of families at the (cusp) of the great depression. The story is centered around the family of protagonist Tom Jobe. Tom is reunited with his family after serving a four year prison sentence for killing a guy in a dance hall. Ford has such a fluid style of film making. The viewer becomes a part of the family as they pack into their old truck and head west to California. I find that Ford uses a lot of visual metaphors to convey his ideas. For instance, when a families house is demolished, ford pans down to the shadows of the family cast over the tracks of the tractor. Symbolizing the destruction of their whole life. With each day the situation seems to get worse as the sun goes down, but each day brings a new hope as the sun comes over the horizon. The film makers fully understood the effects of lighting, that's part of what makes Fords films so great.",7,0,1,24 March 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Fabulous Musical
",Singin' in the Rain provides a host of lovable characters. It is also a cool history lesson about the birth of talking pictures. The film is shot in brilliant Technicolor so there is a grand variety of color to take in. The story is heart warming and noble. With the integration of dance and music this is an instant classic. The song Singin' in the Rain is Gene Kelley's performance of a lifetime. It is so iconic that people who have never seen the film know the song. The cast is electric and they give every moment everything they've got. The film within the film is entertaining as well. Perfect for all ages this film has something for everyone.Every bit and piece of this film is entertaining.,8,0,1,7 May 2014
Psycho," Brilliant Classic!
","It's hard to think of a thriller more well known than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho! Unfortunately the films popularity may spoil the shock value. Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot. After all we haven't even met the infamous Norman Baits yet and already I am on the edge of my seat with anticipation.We arrive at Baits Motel as the rising action rolls into the main plot. What an astounding actor Anthony Perkins is! Perfect casting for a psychopathic mamma's boy! He is an actor that truly understands his role. When he peers through the hole in the wall, spying on Marion you can almost tell the moment when the mother personality clicks on. The only thing that I could have found more satisfying would have been if we saw Norman doing his mothers voice.I love Hitchcock's style. When Marion was stopped by the police officer the way he shot the actors close-up really gave me the impression of invaded personal space and added to my discomfort. He also had great techniques for moving the camera into may different positions without cutting. When the camera follows Norman Bates up the stairs to his mothers room the camera does a 360 as it climes and we are left with the perspective of a bug on the wall.Psycho is a classic horror/thriller that I will watch again. It provides an outstanding cast and fantastic cinematography. The timeless score that accompanies the film could not be any better.",10,6,8,28 March 2014
