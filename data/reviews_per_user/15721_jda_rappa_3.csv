Blade Runner 2049," A sequel which manages to do the impossible: be better than the first masterpiece
","All I ever wanted for a 10/10 movie was to leave the theaters emotional not because the movie was sad but because it gave me everything and more. And for the longest time I thought it was a dumb standard cause nothing delivers. A combination of the company, the film, and the environment (Atmos, leather seats, good food) made for a truly amazing experience. Definitely need to rewatch this another one or two times but holy.Easily the best looking film I'v ever watched. Now that he easy part is done:It was thrilling, it was thought provoking, it was emotional, beautiful, heavy, smart, and well all around one of the best films I've seen. I liked the first one a lot, but this is what I expected when I hear everyone saying the original is a true masterpiece and one of the best films of all time. Even at a long screen time of 163 minutes, I was not bored for a second. Complete immersion was achieved in part due to the amazing Dolby Atmos theater I saw this in as well as the great score and visuals. The slow burn definitely led to an amazing bang, and at the very end I could not believe this had met and surpassed every expectation I had for it.At the end of the day, this movie is not for everyone. I wasn't ever bored but I can understand if someone else is. Even when nothing was happening the score, the set design, and the cinematography acted as characters to the plot and enhanced the experience.I could not recommend this enough. I want everyone to watch it as it is currently bombing at the box office, but at the same time I'm almost happy it is so it assures we won't get another sequel after this, at least for a while.",10,3,13,7 October 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," Suspense. Then some more suspense.
","Wow, finally bought into all the reviews and decided to watch this movie, and by all means it was very good. The acting, the writing, the screenplay, everything was worked out very well and for a movie with such a small scale it was very well shot as well. I felt at times it slightly dragged and I reached for my phone, but quickly put it down as something happened. My only qualm with this movie was that it felt somewhat predictable. And the ending. If the ending didn't include that 1 thing, or if it did but was done better in a not so 'i'm a blockbuster' sort of way, I would have loved it. Nevertheless, while watching this movie there are several surprises and moments that jump out at you. Very fun watch, would definitely recommend buying on bluray or renting it.",9,1,2,6 September 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Good movie, fun, but parts drag and bring the rest down
","WAYYYYYYYYYY Better than critics are making it seem, not better than the hype surrounding it pre release. Many parts were amazing, almost all of it was visually stunning, something marvel will never match. But it had its flaws, parts were mediocre or boring or fell flat, and there was a whole side story line that was totally useless and had little impact. Also felt a little long in the end, but overall a good movie, definitely worth the watch. Batfleck is the best batman ever, watching this movie and then watching the fight scenes from Nolans trilogy (i loved it) is painful. And lastly, wonderwoman is totally perfect, everyone will for sure love her and the job gal gadot does.",8,2,4,25 March 2016
