Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent Movie whose strengths outweigh its faults
","Well, as I catch up on sleep from the midnight screening at Q Cinema 9 here in Omaha, let me say this. The critics are dead wrong. This is a great movie. Definitely not the best ever, but still very good with a good shot at beating Titanic's record.The first hour was a little slower paced than I would have preferred, but in hindsight so are the first hours of the first 3 movies. Once the movie hits the pod race scene, however, the movie is vintage Star Wars.The pod race scene and the final battles (or 4 parts of one battle) are awesome, especially Darth Maul vs Obi-Wan and Qui-Gonn. Vader and Luke never had a lightsaber fight that was that intense or stunning.The special effects are the best ever in a movie. The soundtrack and sound effects are probably up near or at the top as well. The acting is average, but go look at the first movies, not exactly outstanding either.The biggest downfall is Jar Jar Binks. I realize Lucas made these movies for kids, but Jar Jar is nothing more than annoying to anyone over the age of 10. They could have at least made his speech understandable instead of slurred or subtitle it. One other thing I would have done differently was give Maul more screen time and Jar Jar much less.Overall this was a must-see movie, if for nothing else than to see the best special effects ever combined with a great soundtrack and sound effects.My ratings: acting: 5 plot: 7 Visuals: 10 Music: 10 Sound FX: 101st hour(up to pod race): 7 (Visuals save this 1/2 of the movie)2nd hour(rest of movie): 10Overall: 8.5-9.0 (Jar Jar lowers it a 1/2 star on his own, and the other flaws, though overshadowed, are still present)",4,1,2,19 May 1999
Minority Report," Typical Spielberg
","A good movie spoiled by two things, a standard overblown Spielberg ending and the lack of any philosophical viewpoints whatsoever. Not to mention his insulting the viewer's intelligence by having Tom Cruise do a voice-over during the climax when the 'minority report' is being shown at the party.This movie would've been so much better had it ended with Cruise haloed, but instead Spielberg has to make it a semi-happy ending.An above-average movie, but Top 200? Not even close.",5,1,2,11 July 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious movie, but not for everyone
","Very funny, it had some moments that could make anyone and everyone laugh, but the content was about as close to NC-17 as I think you can get without actually getting that ranking for a non-exotic movie. One of the funniest movies I'd seen in a while though, I liked it more than Austin powers 2.",7,1,1,1 July 1999
Pearl Harbor," The Summer Movie version of War
","It's not that Pearl harbor is a bad movie. In fact many parts of it were quite enjoyable. My dissatisfaction comes from the fact that this is obviously an attempt at a summer movie rather than an Oscar candidate. If I was a World War II vet (or any vet for that matter) or a Pearl Harbor survivor, I honestly think I'd be extremely ticked off.Pearl Harbor was a profound event in American History. The attack basically awakened America from its Great Depression and launched us into WWII and eventually the atomic age/cold war/etc. I get goose bumps every time I listen to FDR's famous speech. And yet this movie spends more time trying to entertain than providing the real drama of the tragedies of war. They show the Arizona exploding but don't follow it all the way down, I did not feel the sorrow in the aftermath scenes that I did in Saving Private Ryan, when this was an ultimately more tragic event in that we were the losers. If they wanted real drama drop 30 minutes of the love story and focus 30 more minutes on the tragedy of war.Saving Private Ryan this isn't. This is WWII meets Armaggedon. It's a very well done Summer Movie. However anything dealing with Pearl Harbor deserves better than a summer movie listing. 7-10",3,0,0,26 May 2001
