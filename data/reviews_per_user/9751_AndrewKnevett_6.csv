Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A charmless, CGI extravaganza
","George Lucas once said you can not replace good story telling with computer graphics, or words to that effect. It seems over the years that phrase became lost as George began creating and filming three of the most disappointing prequels ever to be released on celluloid.I can only echo what other critics have said of these films. The characters are charmless or annoying, the dialogue and acting is laughable, there are numerous plot holes, the actors look bored speaking their lines with all the passion, charisma and conviction of wet cardboard. Lucas has tarnished his own reputation with these duds presumably to satisfy his own ego ensuring he and no one else completed the Star Wars series.Avoid unless you're a child or have an IQ of single digits.",1,4,10,3 December 2010

Downfall," A truly harrowing insight into the last days of the Reich
","Der Untergang is an impressive and brilliant piece of film making and ingenuity. Oliver Hirschbiegel was perfect choice as director, and he and his team have done an absolute fantastic job with the set designs, make up and costumes to make Hitler's inner sanctum and Berlin look and feel as authentic and real as possible. I was thoroughly engrossed from the start to end, and you will be, too. The choice of actors could not have been better. Bruno Ganz as Hitler gives the performance of his life and the supporting cast all do a great job also.I must admit I've never really understood people criticising Der Untergang for humanising Hitler. It was right that the film makers chose to portray Hitler going through all the emotions as described by those who were around him at the time. If you'd prefer see Hitler caricatured as Satan watch Hitler: Rise Of Evil (ok, that was a film portraying Hitler's rise to power rather than his final days alive, but you get my drift). Der Untergang doesn't set out to paint grotesque caricatures of Hitler and his generals as evil monsters. It attempts to bring to life as vividly and accurate as possible what went on without showing bias. Also the plight of the German refugees walking through rubble and children as soldiers hit me profoundly.Adolf Hitler will always continue to arouse interest in people for many years and centuries to come. Der Untergang is the definitive account of his last days alive and a must see for all.",10,4,7,21 November 2007

Back to the Future Part II," A mess
","I'm a huge fan of BTTF1 but this sequel is too convoluted and the characters we know and love from the first film give birth to offspring who become grotesque caricatures of themselves from the first film. For example, while Biff in BTTF1 was an endearing bad guy, Biff in the future screams at people in a high pitched tone making him annoying and unappealing.The amount of futuristic gadgets become a distraction to the story. The writers were being extremely over optimistic to think that in 2015 we'd be flying about in cars, have robots that walked dogs and hover boards. If we want to gape at special effects or gadgets there are an abundance of sci-films. I didn't quite see the point of having George McFly being held upside down as some attempt to show we've advanced medically to allow that. Why I ask would any human want to see the world upside down besides the fact that being held upside for long periods can be damaging, OK maybe I'm nit-picking here but you get my drift.Yes BTTF2 its still watchable and has some funny scenes, but overall it is a darker confusing sequel that could have been so much better.",5,1,2,20 March 2010
Braveheart," Historically inaccurate and overrated
","Braveheart has to rank as one of the most overrated movies in the history of cinema. Yes it is visually stunning and the battle sequences are extremely well done, but it is historically inaccurate and portrays the English in such a bad light that the film has been used by the Scottish National Party to whip up support. This distortion of history is, sadly, all too common in Hollywood film making. If and when the United Kingdom breaks up then Mel Gibson can smugly boast to have played a part in its downfall. The fact Braveheart won 5 Oscars awards also shows how politicised the ceremony is. Rated 1 / 10",1,94,214,13 November 2005
