United 93," I saw the movie by myself in at the main IMAX screen SAT 930
","It will make you feel how you did on 9-11-01. It will make you raise your hands up in disgust. The Movie is 50/50 50pct about flight 93 and 50 pct how NORAD and the FAA failed that day. Very well done and accurate. Not republican or a Democratic movie. One of my all time favorite history movies. There wasn't one dry eye in the house after the movie. I did not know till afterward the the head of the FAA played himself. If you are thinking you don't want to see it because you don't want to feel like you did that day think of what Rudy Gullani said on the HBO special 9/11 'You need to relive what happened that day, that way you can think of ways not to let it happen again'",10,2,6,14 May 2006
