It," IT Movie Review; Everyone Can Float Now
","5 Minutes into the movie you'll realize that it is not a movie for kids to watch for sure lol. Di** jokes and gory scenes come along the way. The best thing of the movie is the likable characters. The kids actors really pulled off the movie, they are the heart and soul of the movie. On the other hand, Bill skarsgard as pennywise, dam* he is creepy as fu**. Overall, it is a nostalgic experience seeing these kids fighting out their life of bullying, conservative parents, and clown of course, perfected by the 80's theme. Everyone can relate to this movie. Can't wait for chapter II",8,6,13,9 September 2017
