Ford v Ferrari," Fast pace, brilliant!
","What a great movie from the moment it starts, the chemistry between Christian Bale & Matt Damon is just excellent!Everything was great with this movie, a fantastic true story, cinematography, lots of heart and high adrenaline, totally transfixed whole way through, great seeing it on iMAX screen!",8,1,3,17 November 2019
First Man," Interesting...
","Everyone knows who landed on the moon, this is more about the build up and his home life and how he always remains focused, good insite to the astranault legend, I found it compelling.. this was never to be a fast pace movie.",6,0,0,4 November 2018
Hereditary," Suspense and originality!
","I enjoyed this one, I think usually contemporary horrors aren't all like they were in 70s / 80s but I found this chilling and disturbing and great suspense throughout, Toni Collett is great! We'll worthy a watch and totally original! I would of gone for an 8 rating but could of been a little bit more disturbing haha!",7,1,2,1 July 2018
Captain Marvel," Second half is better!
","Very much a slow burner, liked the 90s setting and a young fresh faced Nick Fury, classic 90s songs too! But felt it lacked thrill or excitement but second half of movie picked up and much more action and ups it game, least we get a back story to main character and ties her in to the main storyboard of The Avengers movies story line",7,2,4,7 April 2019
Aquaman," God set pieces and some action.. that's it
","I think this focuses to much on landscape then core story.Open scenes were great, some during and towards the end... too much cgi and overly exaggerated below sea.Some decent scenes.. an ok movie",7,0,0,12 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Deadlpool 2 kicks butt!
","Absolutely loved it! more laughs, action.. more Deadlpool! From start to finish, lots of action I'm confident to say it lives up to the first movie and beyond!",9,16,34,16 May 2018
Ready Player One," Spielberg did it!
","Great movie from start to finish, what was amazing was the fact most of the movie was in the Oasis, great storyline.. engaging, and a plot easy to follow.Like musicians that change there tune over the course of time, Spielberg has embraced the modern platform with references from the very much loved 80s decade and games from present and past, go see!",8,0,1,1 April 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Good watch!
","Didn't realise this was based on a true story, good acting and well set for the 1970s, good acting.",7,2,5,16 September 2018
Justice League," Second time viewing..
","After watching it again after purchasing on blu ray I actually think it's not a bad movie, all characters work well as a team and .. story isn't the best but easy to follow and lots of great action scenes with light humour, it's a 7 for me!",7,0,1,29 April 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," New, innovative.. Brilliant!
","Had a good feeling about it and thoroughly enjoyed, story was new and exciting and loved the comic book look feel to the movie.. plenty of action and comedy and movie maintains its steady pace throughout, smashing movie!A great spin on the comic book genre and of the endless reinventing of Spider-Man.. well worth a watch!",8,1,2,1 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Brilliant!
","Thoroughly enjoyed a way throw and builds with great momentum, not only is this an action movie so much emotion that slowly builds, I loved the development & build up leading to its finale conclusion, this is what visiting cinema is all about and leaving on a high.This is more then a part 2 of End Game but very much it's own movie that leads to its bitter sweet ending.Director brothers who decided less advertising / marketing prove this is vital to ensure been moments / scenes are left for the audience to discover as it unravels on the big s screen, well done guys!",9,0,2,6 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Another great edition to the previous 3
",Wasn't aware till I read some months ago they were making a 4th movie and yet again... Fantastic!More of what you love about the previous movies with the addition of the main character this time round 'Forky' such a heart warming movie with lots of laughs and great action and taking on the wider environment.For a new generation of kids this is one to watch and as a family.I will be buying on the blu ray boxset when it comes out!,8,29,53,1 July 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Gripping!
","I really enjoyed this, I think every Avengers movie goes from strength to strength making it even more gripping to watch, roll on part 2!",9,1,4,8 May 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Enjoyable movie - 60s Hollywood
","Like many heard mixed reviews before I saw it... generally it's slow pace movie but gradually heating up as it goes on.Never realised Pitt / DiCaprio have never acted on screen before but they had great chemistry and played off one another.Well acted, great insight of 60s Tinseltown and great cinematography throughout, last hour is bonkers!Glad I saw it, loved the feel of the movie and felt like u was watching a 60s documentary in the life of an actor.",7,0,2,25 August 2019
The Lion King," Charming, heartfelt ... Brilliant!
","I really don't get the negative reviews, I thoroughly enjoyed it from the moment it started.Lost in a world that was all cgi that you forget isn't real.A lovely film, with lots of heart, funny scenes and great voices to the characters and some great action sequences, setting was beautiful and lived up to the original Disney animation, equally as funny as the real world movie of The Jungle Book.I strongly recommend those that haven't go see it, blu ray movie for me when it gets released!",8,1,2,1 August 2019
1917," A fine war movie to be seen
","I was confident this was going to be brilliant, and well... It was!Sam Mendes does it again with that famous. continuous shot make you feel you're really part of the story as it's unfolding.Cinematography is also very on point!Compelling, brilliant action, intense .. gripping, heart felt .. A lot to be said for our young war hero's from WW1 that we take modern day for granted.Go see!",9,0,2,20 January 2020
Midsommar," More laughs then scares!
","I admit great visuals and some real gory moments but this being compared to Hereditary no way, this movie was just weird and incredibly trippy ... I have nothing else to add",5,2,4,22 July 2019
Joker," Masterpiece!
","What a fantastic movie.... literally I could write sooooooo much, just BRILLIANT!!!!!!",10,1,5,4 October 2019
It Chapter Two," Not as good as first one!
","Felt this dragged from the beginning and too much cutting from past to present, some decent scenes and shocks of gore but it didn't capture the fear and shock of first chapter.Would of prefer a better ending and more screen time from pennywise, but I felt the adult characters were good choices to play the older versions of the young kids in act 1.I feel the story lacked some how and would of preferred it some how left it a mystery of the entity... I won't be getting the blu ray!",6,0,0,14 September 2019
Creed II," Just brilliant!
","I had high hopes and passed expectation! I've even say better then the first movie! Very multi layered dealing within legacy.. fatherhood, a reunion to 1985 with flash back of the past.. loved it!",9,0,0,19 December 2018
