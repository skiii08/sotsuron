"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," In my dreams. . .
","I am so well dressed! Of course, we can't all have an Oscar winning wardrobe. But Guy Pierce revels in his flip-flop dress and butt-less ensembles.The three leads are so fun to see before the 'big time'. And each of their performances is inspiring. I know a few drag queens and I can see pieces of their personalities and characters throughout the movie.This is a movie that wears it's heart on it's sleeve and it's sexuality on it's platform stilettos! I just love a good musical and currently they are few and far between. Priscilla fills the niche with great music, fabulous performances, and pithy heartfelt dialog in between.",10,4,8,25 April 2006
