First Man," Bad movie of a great story
","I am mystified at the positive reviews. The movie is flat and unengaging. Most of the time you have no idea what is happening and the stock filming technique is super close up of Ryan Gosling with an unsteady cam. I lived through the moon landing and any documentary is more interesting and vastly more informative. The cast is very talented, but wasted.",3,10,16,5 July 2019
