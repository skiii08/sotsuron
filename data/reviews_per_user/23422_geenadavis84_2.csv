The Legend of Bagger Vance," It has a edge of magic, that will dazzle anyone . .
","At first i thought, a movie about golf . .yeah . .Will must have lost it ..but as I kept watching I found myself caring more and more about the main characters. At the end of the movie I thought 'great film'. I think this is the kind of movie anyone could like if you would take the time to get into the story as I did . .Will portraits a very charming character (he didn't really have to try very hard).Matt Damon is also very convincing, not much to comment on that. Its a shame Charlize Theron's part wasn't lager, she's very charming.Inconclusive I would like to add I really (being a Walt Disney fan and all) like the magic kind of edge the movie seems to have with Bagger Vance in it . . Great film!!",10,1,5,16 August 2004
Seven Years in Tibet," It's a 1940's film kind of feeling!
","Great film! Very compelling as you see the two main characters of this movie struggle to survive. Fining there own kind of peace at the end of the film. The way the story was written and performed great, and it also contains a message!What I really liked was that Brad pitt brought some fun into his character form example when they chase the two inhabitants from tibet away. I also like the little fella that played the dai lama by the way, it's nice to see these two having fun portraying there characters (hope i wrote that right). I also like the accent, greatly done. If i had to name flaws i guess they'd had to be, that sometimes during the film you feel like , getting on with the story, while there drinking tea or something . ..bottomline great movie, but ya gotta be in to the genre!",10,6,9,11 July 2004
