Alien 3," The egg that did not hatch?
",As the title suggests this film was a utter disaster on many levels. Unfortunately the story was a real let down on many levels.The very beginning of the film makes no sense as only a complete idiot would not check every single corner on the entire ship and hanger bay before going into cryogenic sleep.As Ripley demonstrated to be intelligent the entire first act is unfortunately ridiculous.,6,1,1,25 January 2019
Alien vs. Predator," You just can't make a pg-13 film in this franchise.
",A lot of the scenes from this movie were cut and edited from the original takes. This is why the movie gets so much hate from hardcore fans. There is no directors cut.Secondly the women at the end is supposed to be given the option by the elder predator to go on the ship because of limited fuel in the mad cat she will never survive until rescue. Machiko was her name and she eventually was supposed to be a vad ass predator. Rising through the ranks to the elites.,4,1,1,19 July 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Gut wrenching depression.
","The movie itself from the very start of the first scene which is a space battle, was completely and utterly illogical and technically incorrect. Watching this was like seeing a best friend die a horrible death that filled you with both gut wrenching depression as much as terror as it continues.Because as it continues it gets worse and worse and worse and worse. Disney should pay people for psychiatric therapy after being before exposed to this visual and auditable garbage. Or we should at least make Star Wars the last jedi anonymous focus groups. Thank you.",1,8,11,16 July 2018
