Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," The Case Of The Curate's Egg
","I really wanted to like this, as I loved the previous Mitchell offering.But this one was let down by scores of anachronistic props and modern dialogue which grated on the nerves. The M1906 Mauser pistol and the 1912 Vickers Machine gun were bad enough but when Watson started firing what appeared to be a World War 2 Owen sub machine gun things got really stupid.This was all after the date being boldly stated as 1891 in the first scene. We also had not one, but two, Checkov's guns. i.e. a device is introduced early on that we just know will be used in a later scene. Like the obvious man trap in Straw Dogs that was just obviously going to have someone in it by the last reel. Here it was the magic Dungeons and Dragon's style healing serum, and the ridiculous cyberpunk/ Thunderball style micro breathing apparatus. Two get out of death free cards for our hero that were total pants.Despite all this there were magic moments of acting and direction, but I was just too appalled by the under use of Irene Adler and the pointless intrusion of Naomi Rapace together with too much Band of Brothers style gunfire which made it all look like the Battle of the Bulge in several scenes.",7,0,0,15 January 2012
Star Trek," Press the self destruct Jim!
","The writers, producers and actors in this film are accomplices to the murder of Star Trek.SPOILER ALERT ! How dare they reboot the timeline ! How can they prevent everyone in TNG, DS9, and Voyager from ever being born ? What gall ! I sincerely hope they don't do a sequel,but they probably will. The glut of weak sci fi films lately that all earn $140 Million no matter how bad they are is a new milch cow. Screwball comedies, cop films, sicko horror. No make a sci fi film, the money will just roll in. Never mind the fans who have invested 20 years or more of their lives with this franchise.",1,30,44,29 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," A Nasty Piece of Work
","I really wanted to like this. Mark Kermode and a few other reviewers has said the sub plots were worthy of awards. But it was so horrible to watch. The non-Geneva Convention US/Jewish Death Squad. The eponymous 'heroes' of the piece. Where on earth did he dream those up ? Unhistorical, illegal and surely more at home in Viet Nam or Nicaragua in the 1970s. What really saddened me is that many youngsters ignorant of history will think these people were real and not made up. I started rooting for the poor Nazis as these alleged 'heroes' were so vile. I couldn't understand the glorification of the heroes in the film as 'kill them all and let God sort them out' type murderers. All German's were not Nazis. Many were simply enlisted men. Real stories from World War Two reveal this. This was simple racist hatred. Were there really Jewish Death Squads in WW2 ? Or did Tarantino just wish that there were ? I gave up before the Hitler assassination attempt. The fantasy sequence in the cinema was too stupid to bear. The guy portraying Hitler was ridiculous too. The worst version since Mel Brookes the Producers. By making him a buffoon it diminishes him. Why do it ? The worst excesses though remain the unnecessary gory violence. The Mohawk style scalping surely unknown outside the Goumier in the French Colonial Army, and the clubbing to death of prisoners, surely copied from Nazi tactics from the Holocaust, sat uneasily with US troops as the perpetrators. It seems Tarantino's blood lust knows no end and he will never grow up past the age of 18.",2,4,10,23 March 2010
Alexander," Alexander the Grate
","They took a thousand people into the desert for two years and had to justify the expense by putting together three hours of footage as a film. Unfortunately Stone used the wrong three hours. Somehow Petersen's Troy was watchable, and even brilliant in places. This was totally awful. Irishmen transplanted to Greece, with no explanation. Peroxide blond hero with dazed expression. Russian mother who is only two years older than himself. One eyed Dad whose motivation is impenetrable, and then who dies off screen. I gave up half way through the battle of Gaugamela. Despite Alex outlining his strategy using models at the beginning, it degenerated into the usual Braveheart / Gladiator style pell mell nonsense. The Macedonian phalanx was successful because of its discipline. Not for taking part in a chaotic mess. When will directors stop following Gibson's free for all style in battle scenes? It is just lazy and stupid. Alexander wouldn't have conquered the block around his own house if he had behaved like that. What came after this I don't know, as I decided not to waste any more time on this rubbish. Is this the same Stone who made JFK and Nixon ? Is he on crack nowadays ?",1,13,21,30 November 2005
Troy," Ignore the Cassandras. This Film is Brilliant
","Once again legions of moaners pull down a great film. It's so easy to attack Aunt Sallys like Brad Pitt. The poor guy can't do anything right can he ? I ignored the vitriol and bought his movie. Because I loved Pitt in 12 Monkeys, loved Peterson's Das Boot and have loved Homer for 25 years. All the central performances were good. Cox's hollow Agamemnon, Pitt's doomed killing machine, Bean's world weary Oddyseus,Bana's nobility and especially O'Toole's pained and tortured Priam. As for it being untrue to the book - far from it, the film contained all the right bits and only ignored the boring stuff like the Games and unnecessary characters like Idomenous and Diomedes. To have left them in would have confused people. Peterson was so right in his condemnation of Agamemnon, and Briesis as the real tragic heroine of Troy was a novel twist.Where did they find Rose Byrne who played her? A future star for sure.",9,1,4,3 March 2005
Shutter Island," A Masterpiece
","Once again we were told to hate this by dumb-ass reviewers in the press and on TV. Once again, actually applying your brain to the viewing process rewards one with a fantastic experience. The best thing I have seen since Mullholland Drive, and like that film, this one plays with your head until it hurts. This is what a good auteur film should do. If you want something easy go and watch the latest Car Chase movie, you won't be disappointed. What do you get when a mad policeman is asked to investigate himself ? This was simply brilliant. Especially the claustrophobia that built up towards the end as DiCaprio realises that 'perhaps' he is the bad guy. All kudos to all the cast for superb acting. Especially Ben Kingsley in the best thing he has done for years.",10,1,5,14 May 2011
Interstellar," Simply A Masterpiece
","To all the bad reviewers on here, I have only one thing to say. If you hate Sci-Fi don't watch a Sci-Fi film. Of course you won't like it. Watch Fast and Furious 8, or whatever number they are up to. Even I found this hard to follow in the first few minutes. There was some mumbled dialogue, and the farm bits seemed far from 'Interstellar'. But I stuck with it. Was I glad I did. It just kept on getting better and drew you in. The confusing early scenes explained themselves eventually with a fantastic 'Bootstrap Paradox' that was worthy of Dr Who or Star Trek at their best. The spacecraft were real hardware and models just like in the 1990s. Not cartoon ones like we have become inured to in recent decades. The acting was fantastic. Especially from Matthew McConaughey who proved once and for all that he is brilliant. (Mind you I've liked him since Sahara.) This was an epic that I was still thinking about the next day, which is always a good thing. I loved the homages to 2001 A Space Odyssey. But Nolan has made a film that somehow even surpassed that classic. This DVD won't be going to the charity shop. Ever.",10,0,4,8 November 2016
Watchmen," Stunning
","The reviews have been mixed, and therefore it was with some trepidation that I went to see this. Despite being a lifelong comic book fan and having read the original book back in 1986. Oh wow! As good as if not better than Blade Runner. This film will run on forever just like that one. Everyone was excellent. Especially Rorschach. If there is no Oscar for Jack Earle Haley playing him, there is no justice at all. Malin Ackerman too. Awesome. Not 'eye candy' like some clowns have said. Her character is the central role in the story, so she had to be more than that. She played it brilliantly. Also extremely well acted was Patrick Wilson's take on Night Owl. A middle aged man with problems some fifteen years older than the actor himself. Now that is good!90% faithful to the book which seems impossible, but true.I loved it all except the guy playing Nixon's rubber nose which was a tad silly. The only thing could really fault was the horrendous Bob Dylan cover by My Chemical Romance played at the end. I agree with other posters that this was out of context and in the wrong film. Not only that, but it is probably the worst track they have ever made. It sounded like it was made in one afternoon's jam session - it was crap! Why put this this incongruous awful music on the end ? Was it done to make the goths go to the cinema to boost takings ? What possessed the Producers to throw red paint at their otherwise beautiful movie ?",9,2,5,7 March 2009
Wanted," Not Wanted
","I wouldn't normally review a film without seeing it. But the trailers were so bad I couldn't bare to go and watch it. Bendy bullets. Give us a break ! But the thing that really sickened me was the bus stop advertising campaign. In Liverpool UK ( and no doubt other cities ) we really don't need glamorous depictions of powerful handguns being waved around by glamorous Hollywood stars. We have enough real handguns being waved around by teenagers, and fired at people ending lives.The rich people from Beverley Hills that made this stupid film won't have to live with the consequences of their hyper realistic CGI violence. Sadly the real people in cities like mine will.",1,8,29,28 July 2008
Jarhead," Just What Was The Point of This ?
","A lot of the dialogue ( This is my rifle etc ) and the boot camp intro seemed lifted from Full Metal Jacket. Even the fly nature of the main protagonist. But after half an hour I felt nostalgic for that old classic. This film was nowhere near as good. I seriously doubt indiscipline is this bad in the USMC. A lot more of them would get killed by accident. Or by their own side. The firing the guns into the air to the rap party backdrop was pure hokum. Why was knobhead (sorry jarhead )shown as being a Camus reader for all of five minutes, and then later shown to be a total moron for the rest of the film ? Sci Fi is accused of being all Science and with thin character development. This was a supposedly factual film, but despite that had 2D characters that were worthy of the worst Sci Fi. By the end I didn't care if any of them lived or died they were so irritating and boring.",Null,6,11,17 September 2011
Jackie," A Wasted Opportunity
","This was such a wasted opportunity. Natalie Portman's performance was superb. No one can detract from that, but it needed something more to make this into a film. You kept waiting for it to get started, but it never did. Things just plodded on for the full length of the movie. As Jackie was the centre of the story, only 2 dimensional cyphers seem to have been recruited to pad out the rest of the cast. Many only had first names. So we played 'spot the historical character' as Bob, Bill, Jack, Dave etc were introduced. Some captions for the uninitiated would have been useful. I have studied the period for 30 years and I was confused. What the casual viewer was supposed to make of this I do not know. Also some characters were unnamed, yet played by totally miscast actors. So I'm only guessing that Clint Hill and Godfrey McHugh were who I supposed they were. There was also a coterie of unnamed women, who were completely unrecognisable. They had about one line each. One may have been Eunice Kennedy. Who knows? Attempts were made to reproduce some historical scenes. Such as the LBJ swearing in. But for some reason some details were omitted. Why was Albert Thomas's sly wink to LBJ deleted? It happened. It's clearly in all the photographs. This raises questions about the whole idea of verisimilitude. What do you keep in, and what do you keep out? Perhaps whole people. Poor Edward Kennedy was deleted again. (Just like in the Kennedy's TV series) For most of the film. Until, someone realised he had to be shown marching in the parade with Jackie and Bobby. Then a mute, unintroduced actor was included. Who was never seen again afterwards. Other people, who Jackie had poor relationships with, like Katzenbach and Hoover were also conspicuous by their absence. Lots of dialogue could have resulted by their inclusion. The real people who were included, Bobby and LBJ, were so lacklustre and unlike themselves that it also did a disservice to history. I get it. This was supposed to be all about one woman. The title said as much. But she did not exist in a vacuum. She interacted with strong ego driven people who made history. Surely they should have been shown doing that. The Director was hell bent on showing her as 'alone' so everyone else had had to be downplayed, silenced, or in some cases erased. One surprise was the first ever correct representation of the effects of the bullets on JFK. This has been misrepresented so many times before that I've lost count. So kudos for that.",6,0,0,2 June 2017
The Duchess," Underrated and Brilliant
","It seems to be a common consensus on here that this film was unfairly savaged by the critics. I have to agree.I expected nothing from this due to the hideous revues it had received. However, when it was on the TV recently I gave it a try.Simply marvellous. I was hooked from the beginning. Sumptuous sets and really good acting from Keira and Mr Fiennes as usual. What a bastard ! I would have shot him if I was his wife. There were plenty of guns and swords around his house.I couldn't fail to compare it with similar snore fests like Age of Innocence and Dangerous Liaisons which bored from point one, and never achieved what they did here, and both of those films were critically received.",Null,1,2,28 August 2011
Resident Evil," Agh Kill Me Now................................
","I expected a slick American CGI explosion fest from this. The Film 4 logo on the opening credits was a bit of a give away. What we got was a cheapo British film with limited special effects and crap sets. The only special effects that were tagged onto this prosaic exploration of concrete tunnels and an office building were the laser slice up session, the CGI Alien creature rip off, the unexplained red dogs ( some which seemed to be a real dog covered in paint )a few slow motion bullets a la Band of Brothers and the Matrix and the hologram of the little girl. The rest was low budget British TV movie fare of the lowest order. Very basic zombies. i.e paint ordinary blokes in white paint, and add a bit off blood. Then the script. Where do you begin ? Basically take Aliens Space Marines and replace them with clichéd SAS types straight out of Ultimate Force. Don't even change the Hispanic girl Marine from Aliens, keep her in. Chuck in some Bourne Identity amnesia for the two central characters. This helps when they look bored and confused and disclaim their lines as if wishing they were somewhere else. Add some water. Hey it worked in the Abyss ! Then when the rushes still seem boring, throw in two nearly nude scenes of Mila for the teenage pervs to salivate over. If they'd had the bottle to make them fully nude it might have been worth the wait. But like everything else in this shoddy film they were half hearted.",1,15,29,26 May 2005
Tigerland," More From the Shlockmeister
","I realise that the US Army was demoralised by 1971, but this film was unbelievable. It was supposed to be a training camp not the SS punishment battalion in a Sven Hassell novel. The writer must be a real Army hater. The psycho sergeant who kept beating the crap of people belonged in a prison cell, and the useless Black top sergeant should have been sacked as well. These men were going overseas, the receiving units would surely have wondered where all the unusable damaged recruits were coming from, and an investigation would have ensued. The scene that blew it completely was the electrocution one. Farrell, the alleged barrack room lawyer, would have had the instructor over a barrel for issuing an illegal order ( to torture POWs in contravention to the Geneva Convention ), actual assault on an enlisted man, sexual assault and conduct unbecoming an officer. Intead he just walks away. After this, discipline brakes down into a madhouse level and the film becomes unwatchable. I don't know how it ended, I went to bed.",3,3,6,17 October 2005
Gone Girl," Agatha Christie for the Internet Generation
","The mumbled and unintelligible dialogue lost me for the first ten minutes, but I gave it a second chance as the mystery developed. The boring characters were just about bearable as the plot began to twist and turn. But Affleck and Pike were so cold and mysterious, even with each other, that it was hard to like either of them. So where was your emotional engagement here? Only Margo was remotely interesting. This film also had some of the least erotic and downright odd sex scenes ever filmed. This was a film of two parts. The first part ran through all the clichés of the detective thriller. But we were cheated in the second part when the villainess inexplicably got away with it. In Agatha Christie books, when the killer makes a mistake and has a sudden change of plans this is usually their undoing. As things planned for the original crime stand out like sore thumbs in the adapted scenario. Then they get caught. End of Story! In this particular tale it was the diary. Why would Desi have taken it to a house he didn't know existed, and fail to burn it properly, when he could have burnt it in seconds in the fire at the crime scene ? The cops would have seen through that in seconds, and then the rest of her contradictions would have unravelled. What about the attempted purchase of an illegal gun ? The purchase of the car, the credit card purchases of the electronic toys, the puppets, the Treasure Hunt clues ? None of which could be attributed to Desi, so someone else must have organised or staged them. And just who was supposed to have tipped off the cops to the woodshed ? All non – sequetors that made no sense in the end. Columbo would have had her in the slammer long before the final reel. But the cops just let her off ! The non – examination by the medics of the blood covered Pike was utterly ridiculous. This hospital must miss lots of wounds as they simply don't look for them. Don't let me get taken to this sloppy hospital if I get run over ! She would have had none of the injuries from the initial kidnapping, but a mysterious venepuncture wound on her arm, both of which would have lead the cops once again to think the kidnapping had been staged. We also got treated to homages to Fatal Attraction and The Hand That Rocked The Cradle were the female lead had to be totally insane, not just confident and calculating. This is the old 'male gaze' all women are evil psychos drivel being rehashed for a new generation and we can do without it.",1,23,44,11 March 2015
Lincoln," Best Film of 2012
","This was exceptional. I feel as if it wasn't a movie, but some sort of time probe back to the Civil War and we were watching the real people. Day Lewis literally was Lincoln. The dry as dust dead men of the House Of Representatives were brought back to life. I only hope these characterisations were accurate, as they were brilliant. Tommy Lee Jones also was on top of his game, along with the underrated David Strathern who was once again a rock solid foil to the more famous actors. I even forgave James Spaader for some of his previous juvenile work, as here as a middle aged man he was brilliant. So many good scenes, but the murder seen through the eyes of the son was a brilliant twist. The inevitable Ford Theatre endgame is overused in a dozen other films and TV series and needed a different approach. Many on here have called this film boring - the usual action film buffs who have no patience - I myself didn't even notice the passage of time. In fact the weakest scene was the battle scene at the beginning which seemed to have been shot by Mel Gibson it was such a mess. The usual pell mell chaos a la 'Braveheart' we have suffered since that film. (See 'Gettysburg' or 'Glory' for how to do it properly.) Oh, and the hundred or so extras walking in the rain without inverting their rifles were in danger of a breech explosion. Did no one, not even Mel, spot that howler ?When is the DVD out ? I want to see it again !",9,1,2,6 February 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Totally Awesome
","There are not many films that you are still thinking about several days later, but this is one. The acting from a cast of (in the US / UK ) unknowns was first rate. Not having a well known star helped with the sense of disbelief. Somehow when watching Jennifer Aniston, for instance you always know its her and you can't forget its a film your watching. This was very real, too real in the rape scenes, and in the graphic coverage of the serial killer, but not poorer for attempting verisimilitude. Yes some parts of this were uncomfortable to watch, and God knows how the TV will ever show it uncut. But I applaud the film makers for doing it so well. I couldn't help thinking what a mess Tarantino would have made of it. The female lead was brilliant. I hope they film the other books in the series and let her reprise the role. Easily the best thing I have seen this year.",10,1,6,25 March 2010
Mulholland Drive," Astonishing
","I'm only sorry I waited until this week to see this. Perhaps put off by the diabolical fatuousness of Twin Peaks. But eventually due to the rave reviews I took the plunge. Am I glad! Lynch really comes of age with this film. One of the best things I have ever seen. Watching it I realised Life on Mars and Lost were homages to it's amnesiac, we're all really in purgatory theme. Mimicry being the sincerest form of flattery.My only criticism is that a lot of crap from the aborted TV series was left in. The dwarf gangster, who just disappears half way through, and the pointless scenes with Adam, which you can fast forward through and lose nothing. Plus the scenes with the tramp and the dreamer guy. How were they possibly related to Diane's POV ? They could only be seen by the omniscient director not her character.But still. This wreaks your head and is still there days later. I spent about three days trying to solve the puzzle. And I still haven't. Plus no two viewers ever have the same solution. Simply brilliant.",10,4,7,18 August 2010
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Most Preposterous Plot of 2008
","This started off quite well. My wife has read the book and said it was much better, with much more from the child's point of view and more humour. The actual premise about a child not understanding the Nazis was quite good at first, but it just got stupider by the minute.What we got was a TV level budget. Don't build an actual Concentration Camp, just go to an old RAF base in England and film one corner of the fence. Behind the Jewish boy was a pile of broken concrete stanchions from the derelict base. - In every shot! Why were there no double wire, electric fence, booby traps and machine gun towers (on the corner - doh! The most obvious place to put one ! )? Answer - so that the kids could sit and play unseen by the guards. Utterly preposterous. Then it had to get really stupid. The only person in history to break INTO a prison. Then he gets taken into the gas chamber without getting his ID number checked ? Unbelievable. I have seen more believable plots on Smallville or Charmed.Oh, and I've just noticed the box art. The ridiculous tower-free fence corner is misrepresented as a straight fence, and the broken stanchions from the derelict RAF camp are not shown. Did the artist realise how stupid it was ?",5,5,11,4 May 2009
La La Land," Good, But Don't Believe The Hyperbole
","From the incandescent reviews that preceded this picture, I was expecting something like a cross between 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Moulin Rouge'. By the end of the opening sequence on the motorway overpass it was obvious we were going to get neither. It was all shot outdoors with naturalistic lighting. Despite this being LA, one of the sunniest places in the world, the light was poor. Shadows fell over faces, and in the night time scenes people almost disappeared, even the two leads. If they hadn't been wearing that yellow dress and a white shirt they would have disappeared altogether. Strangely, on the promo still, both characters are illuminated in a Gene Kelly like glow worthy of Cinemascope. This was disappointing to say the least. Then as the fantasy sequences began, I expected there to be a switch to full lighting, or a change of film stock to zap us into the eponymous 'La La Land' of the title. But no, these were dull and poorly lit as well. Wasted opportunities. How my wife and I yearned for Kelly or Baz Luhrman to jazz this up a bit. (Pun intended). What we got was a pretty prosaic story, with no real antagonist to thwart the couple. There was no evil boss, horrible parents, wicked sister, invading army or other McGuffin to keep them apart in the third act. All we got was a rather contrived row, which could have been sorted out with one phone call. Thousands of couples survive being on the road, or becoming a film star. Why was it so difficult for these two? I thought of Johnny Cash and June Carter. Who really did love each other forever, despite decades of troubles. Then a whole 'Sliding Doors' Alternate Universe happens, and our heroes' lives go off on an inexplicable tangent. Did neither of them pick up the phone in five years? Boy could these guys hold a grudge after one aborted dinner! So, despite being an alleged homage to Hollywood Musicals, we don't get a happy ending. I get it. To suffer for one's Art, pain is necessary, especially in Jazz or in Method Acting, but you sort of promised us one. At least in the promotional material. The acting itself however, was first rate. Both Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone were as good as ever, and did their best with the often underwritten material. For them alone the film still gets an Eight.",8,1,5,13 January 2017
Stalingrad," Excellent
","Apart from the low budget, there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at any one time, plus the same 2 half tracks, this film is absolute top class. Everything is accurate. That is the point, I think, from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionment.Everyone is as grey as the field grey uniforms. Grey men with the life drained out of them. Forget US made Gung ho rubbish like Blackhawk down and Private Ryan. This is one of the best war films ever. Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and story. Please could we have a proper Un-dubbed German language with English subtitles version in the UK ? Without having to pay ridiculous import charges from Europe. Most other DVD's are multilingual. Why not this one ?",10,8,10,3 November 2005
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Give it the Bird !
","First of all there seemed to be two films. The Black Comedy and Smallville style costume free superhero film that was advertised, and this miserablist Art House thing that we ended up watching. Obviously the media decided that if they advertised it as seen no one would have gone to see it and they would never have recovered the SFX costs of the fantasy sequences. All the cast turned in stellar performances,however which made this even more annoying. You couldn't fault what they did with the dire script and its banal dialogue. Hollywood still doesn't know how use profanity, so why bother ? The eight uses of the word 'balls' was cringe making and made me long for Eddie Murphy or Chris Rock before they lost theirs. Perhaps the redundant use of this word was a comment on the film and it was a load of them after all ? The best thing in it was the use of Batman's modulated voice as his Harvey like alter ego. But then they had to ruin it by making him a solid hallucination and showing us some chickenman joke figure. We never saw Harvey.....better film. The long continuous shots were done better in Rope and had better joins to hide the fact that in places they weren't continuous. Steadycam has already been done to death and merely made you nauseous. That bloody drummer - he was annoying from the credits onward. When he appeared for real (twice) why did no one tell him to Shut the f*** up ? I kept waiting for this to get better - it didn't. The film should have ended when he shot himself. But you could tell they'd added another 10 minutes on the end for the 'ambiguous ending'. There was no need for this. Also, even Kevin Spacey in the weird KPAC did the alien thing better !",2,5,10,31 May 2015
Munich," Best Film of 2005
","Sheer brilliance. As a former soldier, and one who has studied terrorism and its aftermath for my degree, I couldn't fault this. Superb casting, ensemble acting, direction, and photography. Not a single anachronism or dodgy prop. Brave script and riveting execution. Almost as good as Shindler's List. Spielberg never ceases to surprise you. There is always something else great up his sleeve. How many other directors/producers can say this after such along career. Eric Bana was absolutely brilliant in the central role. Ciaran Hinds was unrecognisable, leaving his BBC Julius Caeser behind.( how on earth did he do the two roles back to back ) Only the blonde Bond was out of his depth. Playing yet again a two dimensional muscle man, just like in Road to Perdition, yet this time with a cod South African accent.",10,3,6,19 May 2006
Windtalkers," One of the Worst War Films of all Time
","Having read some of the historical detail around the Navajo talkers I thought that maybe this might have been a good film. But then I didn't reckon with the double whammy of John Woo and Nick Cage.Thankfully I came in in the middle, on TV, and missed the first half. I arrived in the middle of the most ridiculous battle scenes ever filmed. Men standing up in the open waiting to get shot. Short range Tommy Guns given the range of rifles and hitting people at long range. Long range Browning Automatic Rifles being saved for close range. Grenades that seemed to be filled with napalm throwing huge petrol explosions 30 feet into the air. This was a WW2 Kung Fu film. Everyone was running around at double speed just like in those Hong Kong comedies. But this was supposed to bea serious film ? A career nadir for Cage. He has made a lot of rubbish but here he seemed to be stoned. A one man army without any emotion. Even John Wayne wasn't his bad in the 1960's. This was made in 2002. So why the unreconstructed right wing garbage of the 1960's war film?",1,2,4,3 March 2008
Valkyrie," Gripping
","It's usually a mistake to watch a movie made from a book,especially a historical biography like this one. But this was superb.The complex story was pared down to film length keeping in just the right material. Every tank, truck and uniform seemed accurate, even the ones in the earlier Desert scenes which seemed excessive by previous decades of movie laziness. Where were the old US tanks with a respray we are used to ? The predominantly UK acting team were spot on. Excellently cast and tight and skilled in their execution. Tom Cruise was brilliant and totally believable. I don't care what he does in his private life. That is irrelevant to his performance. Even my daughter loved this film and asked me countless questions about World War 2. If it makes you look deeper into the subject it will have served a higher purpose. The idiots who condemned this film stand exposed by their own ignorance.",9,0,0,10 July 2010
