Lucky Number Slevin," A psycho/drama chess game predicated on mayhem and murder
","The first part of this film runs so quickly and so loosely without good direction that it is a relief when things start to fall into place midway through the meandering plot. Part of the problem is that there are a hand full of people who directed this film. I had the impression that the people who directed and produced this film spent a lot of time over coffee with computer software testing over and over again the logistics of their story line. The gratuitous violence and sex in Lucky Number Slevin is the crazy glue that keeps the flashback scenes from seeming completely without relevant content. The merits of the film are artistic expression; the acting and other technical aspects of film are very good. I was entertained most of the two hours I watched the film; if you can hack brains being splattered everywhere several times throughout the movie, and like a suspense/thriller this is the movie for you.",7,1,8,22 April 2006
