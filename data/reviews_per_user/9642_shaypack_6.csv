Sucker Punch," Good Premise, bad execution
","Going in, I knew that the main character was going into a fantasy world from the previews. I liked the concept. The problem I had was the execution. The thing that bugged me most was the 'double' fantasy. By this, I mean, she went into a fantasy world, then went into another. If they stayed with reality, then went into the fantasy fighting scenes, I would have liked the film. Leaving the theater, I wasn't sure what actually happened in reality. Maybe that was the intent, but it didn't work for me. The second thing that bugged me was the weapons. It is 1955. Even in a fantasy world, you wouldn't have the weapons that would not be invented in another 40 plus years. Even futuristic comic books didn't have these weapons. As far as the acting goes, I was not as disappointed as others have been. The main character killed her sister. Something that would leave anybody in a zombie state. My main question leaving the theater.... Were those 3 girls killed, or was it fantasy?",2,4,11,6 April 2011
Star Trek," Erases all other Star Treks - - Highlander 2
","A true embarrassment to the series. Nothing good ever came from time travel. Well, except bringing back the whales >sic<.... I enjoyed it at the start, then it slowly dawned on me that they were setting themselves up to 'fresh' new sequels. They no longer have to worry about anything in the series (no tribbles)or the movies(no Khan). They hit one giant reset button. The time line has been changed the only Star Trek that is safe, is 'Enterprise'. Yippie. Besides from that, what is up with all the characters being the same age? ALL of them went through the academy at the same time? All those different ranks? That big reset button couldn't cure that. Uhura and Spock hooking up? Are you freaking kidding me? And.. A non-graduating cadet becoming Captain of the enterprise, in what, less than a week? PLEASE! Really disappointed. I felt the same way leaving Highlander 2. How come McCloud didn't know he was from another planet? It could have been better. They could have just told Kirk's story. All they had to do was leave out his junior officers and it could have been great. I'm not the best writer, so I'll sum it up: total crap.",1,67,101,11 May 2009
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," This is it?
","Action was fine, acting and plot need massive work. I understand the concept and difficulty of explaining backwards to Episode IV, but can't we put some thought into the plot? If this and Episode I are the best they can do, how 'bout having a writing contest for Episode III? The Trilogy is being disgraced by these new movies. We've seen Matrix. We've seen Godzilla. We are no longer impressed with Special Effects. It bores us. We need story lines. We need acting. I've seen these actors act before. They are good. All of them. Even Mr. Jackson was weak. I thought that was impossible. But when Yoda puts out the best performance, something is seriously wrong. I don't want to be disappointed. I am also not a clone. You can't make me see a movie that lacks what the original 3 had. Somebody please help the writers!!!!!!",1,0,1,23 May 2002
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Not as good as the original
","I hope the sound editor never works again. For some reason, dialogue was over driven by music. And it wasn't even good music. The first scene, I struggled to figure out what they were saying. That should never happen, but it happens at least three times. The acting was very good. Rooney Mara was an excellent Lisbeth. Just one problem: Noomi Rapace was better. I feel bad comparing the two, but when you remake a film, you are going to have comparisons. If it wasn't for the sound, I would give it a 10, just like the original. There were a few plot changes. I'm guessing that US audiences wouldn't get the jail time for libel. It happens in Europe a lot more than the US. The ending was also different. Don't know which I prefer. Overall a good film. But, see the original as well.",9,8,15,27 December 2011
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Why does QT have to change history?
","The Basterds killed Hitler. Now, the actor and stunt double saved Sharon Tate. To me, changing history to such a degree ruins a film. Sharon Tate and her friends were brutally murdered. Tate had her baby cut from her. I was hoping not to see that once I noticed Sharon was a main character, but come on, killing the murderers before they kill? To disrespect Sharon like this in unforgivable.",6,7,21,27 July 2019
Black Hawk Down," Great Film
","A war started by CNN (hunger) and ended by CNN (soldiers dragged). I've heard some critizism about the amount of gunfire in this movie. Imagine how it was for the soldiers and Somalias who were in the battle. At least the audience can munch on Milk Duds, while the bullets wiz past. This is a great example of soldiers not having proper support for the missions they are expected to carry out. I guess Vietnam proved nothing. I was impressed on how the Rangers and Delta Force were portrayed. This followed documentaries I've seen pretty well. Although, the movie didn't mention that all of Durants crew survived the crash. Only problem with this movie is how visually dark the images are. I thought the theater was messed up, but ads proved that they needed a little more light exposure while filming.",9,0,0,3 February 2002
