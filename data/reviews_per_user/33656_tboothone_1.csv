The Hangover," Sometimes everything is done RIGHT in a movie!
","Simply put, The Hangover gets everything right. First, the movie is hilarious. Second, the direction, script, and comedic timing are spot on. This is one of those movies that guys in their 30's and 40's can relate to very easily. So many of us have either been in or known friends who've been in situations like this only to relive these experiences later in life as our 'You won't believe it story'. As someone who rarely takes time to comment on films, I have to say 'what a great job!' to the director and all the other cast and crew for really getting all the elements to come together so well. From the choice of actors to the cinematography, editing and score, this film made me laugh over and over again, while appreciating how well all the talented folks who worked on this movie did such an outstanding job. I can't remember when I've gone to see a movie more than once, and I've seen this one 5 times! This is extremely rare for me. Don't wait for the DVD go see it now, but I will buy the DVD. I can't wait to see the deleted scenes and extras like director commentary on this. Thank you for making a classic!!!!!",9,7,14,23 August 2009
