The Lobster," Do not waste your time.
","I struggle with the favorable reviews for this film. To call this a weird film does not do justice to weirdness. Do not waste your time watching this disgusting film. It over uses pseudo intellectual psychobabble to disguise pointless animal cruelty and an empty sterile plot. I anticipated a dry comedy and a creative tale about relationships. Being an animal lover, I was looking forward to a film that explored the depth of relations a human can have with the unconditional love an animal has with its owner. Instead, the film lacked any depth regarding relationships at any level, human or animal. Film critics may like it. I cannot fathom viewers liking it. The idea of the film was very catchy. I believe the writers got lost along the way. I certainly did.",2,10,14,24 October 2016
