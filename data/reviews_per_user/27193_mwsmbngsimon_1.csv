Deepwater Horizon," An excellent movie, please you must watch this one
","Deep water horizon is a movie that is supposed to be reviewed as a whole package and not individualized performances of the actors. Its an excellent film that slowly builds itself up from the beginning and as it precedes towards the end,it establishes a connection with a viewer that almost makes you idealize on what exactly happened on that oil rig in 2010. The thing i like most about this film is that i do not know anything about oil drilling,but the director has found a way to translate the complex engineering stuffs that goes on the oil rig to the extent that a layman like me has almost a complete understanding on what went down. The film also has proper execution of the action, that feels real, as in am not sure if they used CGI or they were actually performing the stunts.Without forgetting an excellent depiction of life of a human in different life situation, the film has good arguments you can almost feel the tension between the characters, true depiction of family love, dynamics and it has carried itself well when it comes to the emotional aspect that it might make u cry. This is a must watch film and it has definitely gone into my 'movies of all time' list",9,0,2,2 January 2017
