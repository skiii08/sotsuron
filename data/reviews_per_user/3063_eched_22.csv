Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," it's as wonderfully bad as you think it is
","Oh boy, oh boy! Got this for free at the local library and it was well worth every penny. :) Yes, this is a movie with Lincoln running around with super human strength taking out vampires everywhere he goes with his trusty axe-gun! And yes, it is played 100% straight and the film makers seem to have no idea just how moronic this really is. As a result, this is a so bad it's awesome movie that is on par with such cheese fest as Jack Frost and Postal.Oh my, where do I get started? Cons: 1. The action scenes are so over the top that it's insane. Specifically a stampede scene mid way through the film in which a vampire is tossing around horses as if they were rag dolls. Oh, you have to see this movie just for this scene.2. Vampires can become invisible, but they sure do like becoming visible again to let Lincoln kill them. Actually, they never use this power in combat. They go out of site, pop back in site to let themselves be killed, and then wonder why they keep losing. Maybe if you actually stayed invisible, that would help. :) 3. As stated Lincoln has super strength but it only pops up once in the entire film and has no impact on the plot. It also of course makes no sense. Yahoo! The fact that his axe also happens to be a gun is just kind of there too.4. Vampires can't harm each other for some reason...but yet at the end of the movie when the plot calls for it they can ignore that rule because for some reason...5. The entire film just feels overly stylized in this very cartoon way. Think Batman and Robin only more CGI based.The pros? Every bad thing comes together just right making this a moronic blast of a film. You'll laugh yourself silly at this train wreck.Proper rating, 1 out of 10.Rating based on how much fun you'll get out of it, 7 out of 10. :)",1,2,4,9 April 2013
Constantine," The longest anti smoking ad you will ever see
","Constantine is a man that was given the power to see demons by God so he could keep the balance of good and evil. Apparently God has a bet going with the Devil to see how many souls each of them can get. you know, kind of like how they bet on Jobe (I don't know how to spell his name. Maybe when I got some free time I'll look it up). If you don't know who Jobe was, that's no big deal. I was just giving an example.Well, anyways, they have this bet and Constantine is there to make sure that nobody cheats. Because of Constantine's bad life he is doomed to burn for all eternity. Now, Constantine figures he can buy his way into Heaven so he goes hunting down the bad guys and then your movie begins.Keaneu Reeves, aka Neo boy from the Matrix plays Constantine and expect to see some bad acting on his part. He is dieing from lung cancer that he got from smoking. The whole film is turned into an anti smoking ad because of this point by the way. Well anyways, when he starts to cough to illustrate his sickness you can tell he's forcing it. They should have just said he was dieing. His fake coughing only destroys the illusion. But expect to see some darn good acting from Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. Now, I know what you're thinking. Everything ever said about Gabriel has hinted at him being a guy, so you would think that getting a girl to play him would be a big no-no, but it really works well. You see, this incarnation of Gabriel is both male and female, which in a way makes sense because angles wouldn't have sexes. To bad they didn't think this plot point threw and make all the demons the same way. Well, anyways, she/he looks and sounds like a girl but dresses like a man and is talk about as a man. Constantine calls Gabriel a man threw out the film. So, this is a rather creative idea and I must say that Tilda Swinton makes for a darn neat and interesting angel.Now the good thing about this film is for an action flick it has a very smart and creative plot and a very interesting and well thought out conclusion. It's not your wham bam thank you mam kind of climax. Instead it's a very surprising and well fitting one that just works really well. Not what I was expecting, but I'm darn glad they went with it.As most of todays action flicks go, expect to see some bad CGI, but it's never painful. The film makes up for it with its creativity.So, some bad acting from the star, but because this is a surprising intelligent film, and because of good old Gabriel (I hope she gets more acting roles) I'm going to give this film high marks. 7 out of 10. For an action flick this is pretty good.P.S. God has really got to do something about his gambling problem.",7,1,4,16 July 2005
Terminator Salvation," There is one reason why this film is worth your money, and only one...
","And that one reason is the Arnold guest appearance. I can honestly say I have no idea how they did that. That sure did not look like a CGI face to me and he was entered into the film seamlessly, and the five min that he is in, and terminator beat playing in the back, just made the whole film worth while.Other then that the action felt like a hit and miss. Some action scenes were grade A, like this action set piece in the water and the ending fight with the T-800, while other action set pieces, like the truck scene, just seemed to drag. Maybe the adds gave to much of that scene away so it couldn't surprise me like it should have.The other problem I had at least is the humans seemed to be doing to well in this war. The flash forwards in the other films showed them on the brink of death, living off of rats and pure smarts, but in this they had jets and submarines at their finger tips, and because of this I never got the feeling that man kind was a step shy of dieing out.Still, none the less the characters were well done, and when an action scene does get hit right, it goes out of the park.The lowest in the series, but still a good part to the series.PS. The PG-13 doesn't hurt the film at all. All the blood that was needed was in it. Adding any more would have just seemed forced.",7,2,5,23 May 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Confused?
","In order to try and turn Pirates into the greatest/biggest epic of all time the makers of this film have all decided to give it the most epic plot of all time. To bad the plot is to massive for its own good.Believe it or not, but it would take me at least twenty pages to summarize the plot. Yes, it has that much to it. I'm not even going to bother to try and explain it. Short to say, there is a new plot point about once every ten minutes, and sometimes three or four all at the same time. This makes the film next to impossible to fallow. By the end I was so lost I just didn't care anymore.Also, many plot points were simply added to add spice and were not thought threw. There is a massive goddess subplot that ends up going no where and when they at last bring forth the goddess she does nothing more then explode into crabs and doesn't really help anyone out at all, making the whole plot line unneeded. It simply had no pay off.Also, since a lot of the story lines weren't thought threw they come to moronic conclusions. The ending with Will is so dumb I don't even know where to start. Plus, there's the ending to the love story which has Will and Elizabeth getting married in mid battle. The scene is so corny I can't even put it into words. It felt like a school play with a big budget at that point.Lastly, there are no more heroes in the series. Everyone is now stabbing each other in the backs to get what they want and they all secretly want to kill each other. Will, who in the first film was a noble man trying to save the love of his life, has now become a heartless backstabber who only wishes to save Jack just so he can kill him and get his ship. Elizabeth is also heartless and betrays all she meets. These are not the heroes you came to care for at the start of the series. They're all just greedy brats in things for their own gain. Will use to be a likable guy. Now he just comes off as, well, mean.Other then that there is not much to say. The film simply is a confusing end to what could have been a great series. Sad really.",1,21,32,5 September 2007
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," It might just be the most important comedy ever made
","Back when this was made, as we all already know, the world was in fear over the idea that a new war could start and end man kind as we know it.I think that making this film was a very intelligent thing to do. Not only does it present the problem of war and says that something should be done to solve the problem before it is to late, but it also turns war into a joke to help ease everyones fears. The film in a nut shell makes war look ridicules, which in reality it very well is, but making it look this way makes it seem less likely that it will actually happen. This film might have put some people's fears to rest because of just how absurd it all is, but then again it does have a lot of truth to it. It would have raised a lot of awareness to.You see, I didn't live back then so I can only speculate on the kind of impact this film had, but no doubt it was ground braking and it might just be one of the most important films that there is.As for how good the actual film is, well, like I said I did not live in that time, but none of the humor was lost on me. I laughed my head off threw out the film.'My Fuer! I can walk!'Oh my God what a great line!The only thing that bugged me was how suddenly it ended. I had gotten so into it that I didn't want to see it end. I don't think it tops Clock Work Orange because that is far more intelligent and visually stunning, but by God this was a hoot! Smart, witty, provocative, and well all around a great show.10 out of 10!",10,3,6,26 July 2005
Corpse Bride," A bit of a let down, but still rather fun
","I had been looking forward to this film for a straight year. It was good, and very well done, so I must give it high marks, but to be honest it let me down a bit. The biggest flaw, and it really hurts the film, is the musical numbers. They sound horrid, but what's really bad is that they are painfully point form, as if they are only their to tell the story, instead of enhancing it. It's like their more like plot explanations instead of songs, and the fact that the song will stop half way threw, have someone talk normally for five minutes, and then suddenly start up again doesn't help much.What is good though is the look of the film. It looks great, fantastic really. The characters are also rather enchanting, and though the sense of humor is very lacking, when it does pop up it helps the film a lot.The best scene was the piano scene between Emily and Victor. Now that was just plain sweet. If the film had more of that and less of well, kids stuff with the songs, then this movie would be really up their and the end would of had a lot more impact.As is it really just shows off old Tim having a great old time, which makes the film pretty enjoyable, but still flawed.",8,2,2,3 March 2006
She's the Man," A bit to teen movie
","When the opening is a bad music video it is granted that the film is to much of a teen flick. The songs of the week are crammed in(a couple of them redone classics(I almost ripped my ears off when I heard how they had a remix of Bad to The Bone in it)) the humor is pretty typical sight and sex gags(but I, like most am a sucker for that stuff) and the plot line has been done pretty much to death.It's no where close to the charm of 10 Things I hate About You, but it does none the less have some good points, namely it is funny and the star does a darn good job of turning herself into a living cartoon character.So, the gags are nice, and I had a good laugh, but everything else is very standard.Good for one see, but that's about it.6 out of 10",6,1,3,15 July 2006
The Machinist," Hasn't this horse been beaten enough?
","We've all seen it. It used to be shocking and smart, but now it's been done so much that it's dumb and predictable. Let's have a whole lot of random odd things happen and in the end it will turn out the guys nuts. What a smart idea! Buddy it's been done. Do something new for the love of God! Like really, first there was Fight Club, then there was Identity, then there was Secret Window. It's just not a twist any more. You can now see it coming and you now say, 'What, not this again.' So this film gets a 1 for ripping off so many others. Go see the films that started the trend, like Fight Club, not the pieces of trash that rip them off.",1,16,35,5 June 2005
Ghost Rider," Bring on the cheese!
","And I once believed that the cheesiest film ever was Howard the Duck. Boy was I wrong. Ghost Rider takes the crown from Howard the Duck as the cheesiest film of all time, and for darn good reason. What's so cheesy about it? Oh where to start.1. BlackHeart(who is of course related to Dark Heart from the Care Bears) calling himself 'The Legion'.2. Nicolas Cage's cartoon six pack.3. All the bad guys looking like their from the newest boy band.4. The constant cartoon like back drops(IE. the tree shot near the start of the film when young Johnny Blaze kisses the girl).5. The endless, and I mean endless, amount of bad puns.6. The eye zooms!(It's fighting time! Zoom in on the freaking eyes!) 7. BlackHeart being the dumbest bad guy to have ever walked the Earth.( Is shocked to find out that a graveyard has been moved(more then 50 years ago) which has the contract he needs to take over the world in it. If he wants this contract so bad wouldn't he have done just a bit of research on it to find out ware it could be?) 8. BlackHeart killing people by turning them blue.(NOT kidding)9. The fact that a motorcycle/comic book film is trying to be a Western. Bring on the cheesy music.and 10. The ending. That eyelash freaking flew man! The cheese is both good and bad. In other words, this is a so bad it is good film. I was laughing at all the wrong moments and oddly loving a lot of it.The only truly bad thing is the action because there isn't any. Ghost Rider sees bad guy, bad guy grabs Ghost Rider and screams, 'you can't kill me!', Ghost Rider then kills bad guy, then repeat for every single showdown in the film. You can't really call it action when the fight scene is two seconds long.Other wise the film is pure trash that some may oddly love. Bring on the cheese!",6,0,1,13 June 2007
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Besides for the quirky dark humor, this film has nothing going for it
","And it sure isn't no world of pure imagination.Tim Burton does what he does best and goes with the dark, Gothic look and feel, but this time around it feels like he takes it WAY to far especially for a kids film.I guess that's what bugged me the most. Sure, Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka had a bit of a distinct dark side with him making sarcastic comments of 'oh no' whenever one of the kids got into danger and him never showing any real care for their safety, but Johnny Depp's version of Willy Wonka is right out sadistic. Not only are the kids put into massive danger(we are made to believe one of them is about to be incinerated.) but while they are being harmed and humiliated the Oompa Loompa's sing their(so horrid it makes you want to cut off your own ears) songs with the soul reason of taunting the victim.Sure, the Oompa Loompas always sang, but it was AFTER the kid had already come to harm and it was also AFTER Willy told everyone that the kid would be just fine. Also, the songs came across as, well, you can learn something from this incident.BUT in this version the Loompa's are taunting and mocking the kid AS they are in danger. And the harm off the child is multiplied by ten. Let me paint you a picture of one of the scenes.Violet turns into a giant blueberry, but as she transforms(and she gets 25 times bigger then she should) the Oompa Loompas sing their song, as she is screaming, 'Help! Someone help me! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!' And then the Oompas don't just role her out. They jump on her and move her with their feet like she was a barrel. All the while well she is still screaming in horror and while the whole time Wonka is nodding his head to the beat of the song.The whole scene was so utterly disturbing that it made me sick. And I kept on saying to myself, 'this is a kids' movie?' Though the film is rather funny in spots, it's just to dark for its own good. That, and Charlie isn't nearly as likable as he was in the original, and Wonka is just right out creepy.Plus, wasn't Grandpa Joe SUPPOST TO BE BED RIDDEN! At least the original has him fall over for a few minutes at first when he first gets up, but now he can freaking tap dance the moment he stands? Stick with the classic version. 4 out of 10",4,3,5,15 October 2006
Avatar," Without question
","Without question this is the greatest action film, and the greatest science fiction film ever. For a long, long, LONG time I thought nothing could ever compare to Terminator 2. Well, if anyone could surpass it, it would be the man that made the original film, and that's what James Cameron has done.Anyone complaining about no character development has NOT seen the film. An hour and 50 min of the film is spent on ONLY character development. These are some of the most well rounded and in depth characters I've seen in a film. Sigourney Weaver literally breaths her part, as does Stephen Lang, and man, what a great bad guy he makes. In fact to call this an action/science fiction is pretty dishonest. 50% of the film is character drama.The visuals are indeed the best ever. The war scenes near the end are simply stunning. The Na'vi I felt looked a bit off at first, but they fit perfectly in the alien world made for them.The action of the film is mind blowing, and the second half of the film will likely cause you to stand up and cheer. It was very hard for me not to.By the end, the entire theater applauded, I have never been to a showing of a film and seen that before, but my God this film earned it.Stunning sites, great action, and really some of the best acting in a film I've ever seen. Everyone in this film should get an Oscar. EVERYONE In short, you must see this film, and if you've seen it already, SEE IT AGAIN!",10,5,11,18 December 2009
Drag Me to Hell," A cartoon horror film
","Imagine if you will the Bugs Bunny And Tweety Show doing a Halloween special that is acted out by a live cast. That really is all Drag Me To Hell is.Sam Raimi returns to his splatter horror comedy flicks(Evil Dead 2) with a vengeance and if you loved thoughs old movies, or just love B horror or grindhouse in general, then you will LOVE this.But that's what it comes down to, you'll either get the joke or you wont. I saw this with my family, and they all hated it, while I loved it from start to end.So, ask yourself, do you like random crazy stuff hitting the screen every second, do you like blood flying everywhere, do you think the idea of a killer cloth is brilliant, and do you like the idea of seeing someone try to gum a girl to death? If the answer to all these questions is yes, well then why are you not seeing this film?",9,1,3,1 November 2009
Mama," What could have been...
","This has the same thing wrong with it that a lot of bad horror does. It tries to hard to be scary. Endless, cheap jump scares. Things redone from other films 100 times before that used to be scary but are now just warn out. And let's not forget a poorly made CGI bad guy. Yahoo!I wish these main stream horror directors would just say screw you to being scary and actually try to tell a good story. But no, we got to add more run of the mill jump scares to this sucker.Also, a scene rips off the game Fatal Frame. There is also a lot of plot holes. The ghost for example is clearly a good one at the start of the film. It protected and cared for the two kids for five years straight and it killed one guy, a man that was about to kill them. Not actually evil there. But then she goes evil because...? Well the film suggests that she's jealous of the new parents. But if that's the case, why does she wait so long to strike? Her power seems endless at the end of the film. It would of been nice if she had a motive because you can't simply say she's evil due to her literally saving the kids lives. Oh, and did I mention she spends most of the film trying to find her lost baby only to destroy the things bones? Why? Beats me. It's just random.The Annabel character also makes no sense. Yes, I get it, she doesn't want to be a mother, but why does she have to act so distant and mean towards the kids? Just cause you don't want to be a mother doesn't mean you should randomly act like a dick towards some kids you just met. She has no reason to act this way. Sure, she comes to care for them by the end(for unclear reasons) but by then I, the viewer, already see her as a dick.There are only two good things about this. Isabelle Nélisse acting was very impressive with how she moved and acted like an animal. It was so off, but interesting. And the dream scene, which is wonderfully over stylized.This could have been so, SO much better as the idea of two kids being raised in the wild and then having to live a normal life can be made into such an interesting story. Read The Room to see what can be done with an idea like this. Instead, screw that original and thought provoking idea, let's slap some random scary ghost in it! BOO!3 out of 10. Don't bother.",3,3,8,27 March 2013
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," This was a joke, right? Right??????????????
","Given the plot, two people are married, they just both happen to be spies, they are then both told to go and kill each other, you would think that this would be a pretty cheesy comedy film with a little bit of action blended in. Well, to say the least, this film is to action packed for its own good. There is just little dabs of dry humor placed threw out. Nothing to special. Something to make you chuckle a bit. Sadly this small chuckle is the highlight of the film. The action out weighs the comedy by leaps and bounds, and like most action films these days, it just keeps on going and going, and doesn't know when to stop until the whole film ends up dragging. The real kicker is the one spy is a clear Charlie's Angles knock off. From the scantly clad cloths, to the unknown man giving off orders to the army of women spies. This is so painfully cheesy that you would think it would have to be funny, but surprisingly they never bring up the fact that it's a joke and just kind of treat it seriously. When you have a cheesy element you should treat it as such, or else everyone is just going to see it as some kind of cliché.Oh, and here's the best part. Right here. Spoilers! The two heroes somehow topple the entire government/spy system that is after them. This is just to painful to believe. In other films like, The Bourne Identity the government covered up what had happened and cut their losses and then let Bourne live. Bourne didn't actually beat them. You can't beat them! Their the government! They control everything in these spy films! They can shove endless amounts of men down your throat. The idea of someone beating them is just so painfully dumb that it boggles the mind. This is the first ever film that I've seen to pull such a bad idea. Hopefully it will be the last.So, this film was a joke, and should have been treated that way.4 out of 10 Go see True Lies instead",4,4,7,4 September 2005
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," I'm going to go over the cons first BUT
","But that doesn't mean I hate the film, though the cons do come more easily to mind then the pros. I think it's do to there being more cons then pros, but the pros are very high, so I guess you could say it balances itself out. Well, anyways, let's get started: Cons: This is Transformers part 3 not part 2: At the start of the film Prime tells us that the government is working with the autobots in a group known as nest. Nest is formed of many different autobots and in the first 10 min we meet them all, but the film never introduces any of them. It pretty much assumes that we already know all these characters, though I don't see how. Then 5 min later it dumps all these extra nest characters and the actual film starts. It feels like the nest autobots would have been the heroes from part 2 and the opening is simply a recap to say what happened to them and then we move onto the third film, only there is no second film. There's this motorcycle autobot, and this autobot with massive blades coming out of his hands, but does the film ever bother to tell you these characters names or anything at all about them, no. They just pop up and then are gone again. Really, the motorcycle bot had ONE line, what was the point of even putting her in there. And the sad thing is only long time fans of the series are even going to know who this autobot was supposed to be.Random powers: Out of the blue, or at least it feels that way to me, transformers can suddenly teleport and move objects with their mind. There is no reason for these powers or no explanation for them, they are simply there.Barricade is still missing: We all remember how Barricade simply disappeared in the first one with really no reason why. I was really wanting, and kind of expecting, for him to show back up, but he's still just gone.Random plot points: Transformer ghosts! Decepticon girl bot: Once again, another bot that goes the way of Barricade. She simply disappears for no reason. I really don't believe the car wreck would have killed her, she's a blasted transformer! I don't know why this series simply keeps on forgetting about its characters.And now the pros: The Action: Much better done in this one.The special effects: Kind of a no brainier, but it can not be said enough that the visuals in this series are simply ground braking.Scorponok! It may have been only 50 seconds of film but when Scorponok busted out of the sand I nearly got up and cheered. That's what I'm talking about, a character that was simply dropped in the last film popping up out of nowhere and kind of saying, I'm back! Why couldn't the same thing be done for Barricade? Scorponok was the best part of the film.The comedy: MUCH of it does fall flat and MUCH of it is in bad taste, but the first was just as bad with its comedy with Jazz. I still none the less laughed a bit.So, a high 6. Rounding up I would say seven. My cons make the film seem horrid, but I'm still glad I saw it and it should be a film seen on the big screen.",7,0,4,28 June 2009
War of the Worlds," A Nightmare
","This film is dead set on proving its point and theme. The theme is simple, that man is evil. To prove this point it has man put into a spot where he or she would only care about themselves and would fight to survive. Sounds like a natural disaster.And that's what the aliens are in this film, a natural disaster, like a twister or an earthquake. They have no motive for what they are doing. No reason. They are heartless, senseless beings only in the film to cause the mayhem that is needed to show man at his worse. And once man's chips are down it is painfully disturbing what he'll do to get his chips back up, but this is the point of the film.from the start the film is dedicated to this point, and relentlessly so. When the aliens first attack everyone that does not see them up close and personal suddenly believes that it is terrorists doing the damage. This is a bold statement about just how paranoid the US has become, and it also shows man's natural distrust for his fellow man. Of course this is only a foreshadowing of the things to come.Also, the film starts off very bright, and as it goes on the picture slowly gets darker and darker. A rather creative way of setting the tone. Also, the stylish pictures of destruction never stopped to amaze or chill me to the bone.This is a dark thriller that pulls off its job at showing man at his worse, and for doing such a fine job it should be given high marks. The only grip I had was what the aliens looked like when you at last saw them.I have seen all three versions of this film. The original, Independence Day, and now the new remake. This one gets top marks.",9,5,11,20 December 2005
Ray," Ray's ticked, Warwick's happy, and I'm OK
","Let me just star by saying I know next to zip about Ray Charles. I know he was blind and that he sang, 'Hit the Road Jack' and that's it.Now, seeing how this film was made shortly after his death you would expect a movie that was in honor of him, where this one is more of a slap to the face. If Ray was still alive I'm 100% sure this film would make his blood boil. Maybe this is why I didn't really enjoy this film. It was attacking a character that I knew next to nothing about and it was trying to make me hate him, and I kind of got the idea that it was lying to pull it off.Movie Ray(played very well by Jamie Foxx) is getting big into the music game. Because of his brothers death and him going blind he has become very bitter and rude. He mistreats everyone he comes in contact with. He cheats on his wife, he cheats on the girl he's cheating on his wife with. He does drugs. He's short tempered. He thinks everyones out to get him. Etc, etc. Just imagine evil incarnate and you get movie Ray. Now, we all have a dark past, but I know real Ray stopped doing drugs and I'm not about to judge him because of some fictional character that has the same name. This film takes Ray's dark past and multiplies it by ten and then goes on, and on about.Of course, this is one of those stories where the bad guy goes good at the end, but there's no enthuses on it. He just suddenly becomes good and then the movie just ends. The worst thing about it is the only reason he becomes good is because the cops crack down on him. That's not very respectable at all. Well anyways, the movie ends before you can see him do any real good deeds. It just says that he gave to some charities and then it's all over. None of that sticks with you because it's so short. Only the bad stuff sticks with you. This is why Ray is so angry right now. This film only shows off the bad and none of the good.Then it takes a really low blow. It even calls Ray a hack.Movie Ray, 'I don't make up my own music. I listen to other people's music and then copycat it.' Okay, that's just low. Taylor Hackford, you have no evidence to back up this claim and you're fighting a man that is dead and can't fight back. That's just low. If anyone called me a hack, I'd be ticked. Even though I know next to nothing about Ray Charles I can safely say he was not a hack.So, movie Ray is one of the most unlikable characters you will ever see. This film is painfully well acted and directed, but evil movie Ray makes it very hard to enjoy. Like, you can like a bad guy, but he needs something like personality going for him. He needs to be likable when you hear him speak, despite the bad things that he's doing. These guys should have seen Clock Work Orange and took down notes.So, this film has a lot going for it. It's well acted, well made, it's got 'Hit the Road Jack' in it, Warwick Davis stops by(Willow. Man, he's something else. You got to love that guy.), but Ray is just so gosh darn evil and you know he'll be good by the end but there's so little put into his transformation that it's kind of not worth it.7 out of 10. And Taylor Hackford leave Ray alone for God's sake. You could have made the film about his long struggle to quit drugs and become a better person, but instead you just made him look like a jerk. Well Taylor I just want to remind you that I'm only giving you a 7 because it was very well done, but all in all I'm going to be very wary when I grab one of your films. You're walking on thin ice. Attacking a dead man and the hero of a generation. That's just low man.",7,1,3,5 August 2005
Beowulf," Proof that a gimmick is still just a gimmick
","This film was on my avoid at all costs list for quite some time. Why? Cause the film felt like one massive gimmick after another. Oh, it's in CGI! Oh, it's 3D! Oh, the DVD is UNRATED! All the adds sold it on these gimmicks and good visuals, but there was never a statement on the actual plot or why this movie was good? So, the adds didn't sell the movie, they were selling the tools to sell the movie. That right there made me think it would be trash, and was I wrong? The hero, who can't stop saying his own name and must fight all his enemies but naked(one of the most random things I have ever seen) is just silly.The plot is dull and the action scenes simply aren't engaging in anyway. The ending is also plan and predictable. Grendel, who should be one of the films main selling points, is killed off in 30 minutes! Not only that, you can't understand one blasted thing he says So in all, I should have stayed with my gut. A gimmick in the end is only a gimmick and it shouldn't be a mistaken quality for a film.",3,0,3,2 August 2009
Sin City," I know films have gone down over the years, but we still shouldn't settle for trash
","I know what you're thinking. Sin City, got to be a great movie. You've heard nothing but good things and the adds look stylish and cool.Well, let me tell you, it's not the best there is. In fact you couldn't pay me to see it again. I 100% believe that the only reason why anyone is saying this is good is because they've seen some really bad new films, so this actually looks like the holy grail to them. Well, just because you got stuck seeing films like Cabin Fever and Diary of A Mad Black Women, doesn't mean you should praise a film for being slightly less painful.Where to start, well this is a film of about three or four short stories. The first flaw is that each of the short stories doesn't really have a main plot. Each story starts out with a simple plot, but then half way threw it does a 180 and goes in a completely different direction. The film is really all over the place and can't make up it's mind where it wants to go. One story starts with a cat and mouse game between the hero and bad guy, then suddenly the bad guy is dead and the story is still going for some unknown reason, then the bad guy starts coming back from the dead, then that is all forgot about and a mob war suddenly brakes out over a head. No direction what so ever.A few of the stories start to travel into Kill Bill territory. I.E. No plot, just senseless kill after senseless kill until you lose count. Now, some people liked Kill Bill because of this, but personally this annoys me. Senseless deaths start to put you to sleep if they become to constant and the film as a whole starts to turn into a broken record.And I know this is based off of a comic, but did it have to be so much like a cartoon? It's so campy in this cartoon aspect that I thought it was meant to be a joke, but there's no actual joke in it. The guy is tossing cops like he's Superman but there's nothing to really redeem the scene by making this stupidity look funny. Now, not every film should be funny of course, but when a film becomes as campy as this one does it's kind of a given.And to top all this off there is just nothing really enjoyable in this film. It's not an action because you need fight scenes to pull that off and this is nothing but death and bad plot points. It's not a drama because it's to cheesy for it. It's not a comedy because there is nothing really funny about it, and it ain't no horror. There is nothing here to actually enjoy, unless you like horrid and pointless love subplots that go no where. Hollywood sure has come to believe that we love rubbish like that.4 out of 10. Like the characters of the film tell you to stay out of Sin City.",4,8,16,12 August 2005
The Cabin in the Woods," A instant classic, on par with Scream and the other greats
","This film is stuffed with sly dark comedy, likable characters, a twisty turny plot that just gets more smart as it goes, some good gore, and some good jump scares.The climax is a step shy of blowing you right out of your seat. It's so insane! I can't say what happens in the last 30 min, but it will blow your mind.The main great thing of this film though is it takes old horror stereotypes and makes it that you love them. The stoner, the jock, the virgin, are all here. All of them are altered slightly though to make them more like real people and more like people you can cheer for.Get ready to laugh your head one moment and turn away in fear the next. You've never seen a horror movie like this before, trust me.",10,3,18,15 April 2012
Happy Feet," A point to a film is well needed, but do you really have to beat me over the head with it?
","Is this movie about a penguin who can't sing, but can dance and becomes an outcast because of it? Why yes. Is it a light hearted film that you just sit back with? Why yes. Is the 3D animation better then ever. Yep.Yes, the film is exactly what the adds for it promised, for the first 50 minutes, and it's not hath bad either. After those are done though the film just transforms into a completely different show.Ya see, the film has a bone to pick with the fishing industry for over fishing and causing many species of fish to go nearly extinct. Well, this is a good bone to pick and if the film wants to make an argument against these guys it should go right ahead, but the film becomes so obsessed with this theme that it becomes no longer a theme, it becomes the plot of the film, and the original plot of this little penguin not being able to fit in isn't only forgotten, it's thrown right out the window.As a result the thing feels like two different films mixed together. One is the light hearted thing I was expecting, and the other is an in your face one sided documentary that is more blunt in its point then a South Park episode(not making fun of that series. It just gives you a good idea of how dedicated this show is to its theme.) In short, the second hath of the film just bashes your head in with its theme, again, and again, and again. It just keeps on going on about until you can't take it anymore. It simply shoves its own view point down your throat, and as a result you end up with a bad taste in your mouth.And that's the film in a nut shell. One big long rant that I wasn't up for.Also adding onto this is the painfully out of place anti Christian themes. The Pagan comment that is thrown in just for the heck of it really came out of left field and right out makes no sense. Come on Warren Coleman, please tell me? How in the world is Mumble symbolic of the Pagan faith? I'm waiting.Like really, how? Heck, he's more symbolic of being gay then anything. I know you may be thinking I'm nuts right now, but if you have seen the film just take a deep breath and actually think about it. It oddly makes a bit of sense. Hey, if Mumble was symbolic of being gay then all the anti Christian stuff would be kind of fitting, though still to rude and blunt for me.And yes, I'm not over thinking things, the film is pretty anti Christian, and hey, if they had a good enough argument against that faith they can make it, but what in the world does the Christian religion have to do with the fishing industry? Ya see what I mean. The Christian stuff is just kind of there and has absolutely nothing to do with the main point of the film. So please, save that debate for a different movie. It just doesn't make any sense here.Anyways, you get what I mean. The film is just really messed up with its point of view.And what was with using real human actors at the end? Seriously, what was with that? In short, this film isn't for kids. What kid in their right mind enjoys having a heavy symbolic theme bashed into their head? Plus there's a tone of sexual related comedy that is so blunt everyone can get it.1 out of 10. Right now, I sure wouldn't mind living in a world without penguins.",1,2,4,23 April 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Is this the end, or just the start?
","Everyone, on Earth knows about The Simpsons, and everyone also knows that the series has been going a bit down hill lately. The 'newer' Simpsons is by no means bad, but when compared to the older stuff it simply doesn't hold up as well. The flaws seem to be reusing of plot lines, over and over, more jokes, but them not being thought threw as well(it's machine gun humor,get off as many gags as fast as you can, and often it doesn't work) and jumping on the band wagon on a couple of things.The question is, how does the movie play. Does it fallow the flaws of 'new' Simpsons because the well is simply to dry, does it somehow go back to the good old days, does it end the series on a high note, or is it the last nail in the coffin, or does the series not end at all.Well, the film doesn't swing back to the good old days, BUT it shows the 'new' style can be good if done right, very, VERY good.Plot lines are reused like crazy in the film, heck, the Simpsons once again move to a new location for a bit, but a lot of the plot is jacked up to an over the top level, which oddly makes it feel epic in a way. This makes the plot stand out and 'seem' like something new.The comedy style is the machine gun brand, but where the flaw was in the show with a lot of the gags being rushed and not working because of it, this time around they pull off the pace. Every joke, despite the speed of them all, pays off well. I think it's due to the shear amount of writers. Once one of them couldn't come up with any more 'fast' jokes, another one picked up the slack and they all somehow banded together and made it work.Then there was the last flaw, the band wagon. Many 'newer' episodes dealt with issues in todays world and went along with trends going on, and often they didn't pull it off to well and came off as, well, out of place. The film deals with todays problems, but this time they thought things out, and it comes off like a really kind hearted and nice South Park bit. It works, oddly, but it still does.So, this is NOT classic Simpsons. This is the 'newer' Simpsons, but fine polished. It shows that even though things have changed, the well isn't dry yet and the series can still work, darn well! It's obvious from the end that this is not meant to be the end of the series, but for once a lot of old school fans may not see that as a bad thing. This is a new start for the series and has raised the bar for the show.Bravo in making the new stuff work, and yes the film is funny, smart, and quick witted. Enjoy.",10,0,2,15 December 2007
