The Avengers," Cool but...
","I was in 5th grade when I first saw the trailer of The Avengers. I got shocked! I mean Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and the other heroes were in one movie. Heck, it was like a dream come true for me. I saw the movie, it was so cool! The story wasn't much but it was still awesome. The characters were great and so was its finale when the nuclear missile went into space with Iron Man in it then the Chitauri Mothership exploded. But something happened.Now that I got matured, it got different the way I see this movie. Before, I like it very much. Now, I'm like 'Now that I've seen this movie so many times I'm over with it!' I don't really know why but I'm sure it's just that I had a feeling that I should see something new. That's right, the way to cure it is to watch its sequel, Avengers Age Of Ultron. Maybe I'll see it on the big screen, I just hope it happens.In conclusion, The Avengers was a good movie. It's great when you see it the first time.",7,1,4,24 April 2015
The Incredible Hulk," Truly Incredible
","When I was a kid, Hulk was my favorite superhero. I asked my brother-in-law to buy me a Hulk movie. I got Hulk (2003) then I watched and it wasn't what I expected. It was so boring. A year later when the trailer of The Incredible Hulk was shown on my TV I was like, 'Oh my, this looks awesome!' Another year went by when I first saw the 2008 Hulk movie. It was awesome! I mean, it got an appropriate villain unlike the first Hulk movie. It definitely was an improvement from the first movie.The best part of the movie was when Hulk and Abomination fought to death. Unlike when Hulk fought his dad in the first movie that I didn't actually like. Anyway, the action starts slow but it'll leave you satisfied.In conclusion, The Incredible Hulk really is incredible! Watch it and you'll not get disappointed.",7,0,1,21 April 2015
Iron Man 3," Okay but disappointing
","Before Iron Man 3 was shown to theaters, I was expecting of a 'science vs magic' kind of movie. I mean Mandarin with his magic rings will fight Iron Man? So yeah, I expected that in the movie. But that isn't what I saw.Mandarin (Trevor Slattery) is just a powerless and useless character while the real Mandarin (Aldrich Killian) is a guy that has the powers of regeneration and blowing up? I mean why? Why did they do that? But anyway I still liked it though. The action scenes were great but the end credits scene was kinda useless.In conclusion, Iron Man 3 is okay but it'll leave you disappointed.",7,0,3,28 April 2015
Iron Man 2," Lesser Action
","For me, Iron Man 2 was okay but the first Iron Man was way better. Iron Man 2 had less action, more boring dialogue and it's a little disappointing. The story was boring but it still doesn't make me hate it though.Before, I thought Crimson Dynamo would make an appearance but no. We only get Whiplash. Also, in the final fight, Whiplash actually made himself an armor which is odd because he never had a full armor on the comics. Only a mask and some metal parts. I guess they should have chosen a better villain than Whiplash in this movie. In conclusion, Iron Man 2 was pretty much okay. It only had lesser action and a boring story but you'll get through it.",7,1,4,24 April 2015
Suicide Squad," A flawed but fun movie
","I had high expectations before seeing Suicide Squad. When I watched the real thing, it kinda falls down. First of all, the movie was cool looking. It had interesting characters, good action and not so bad acting. Will Smith and Margot Robbie did great playing their respective characters. It made me want to see more. With the down side, not all of the characters were given attention. Even though I pretty much know who Killer Croc, Katana, Captain Boomerang, Rick Flagg and Enchantress are, those characters lack the backstory they needed. Also, Jared Leto's Joker; I didn't love it nor hate it, I just think it's a lot less interesting unlike the previous Jokers like Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. In conclusion, Suicide Squad is a fun movie to watch, it may have its flaws but still, it's fun.",6,0,1,27 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," An Improvement
","Captain America The Winter Soldier is definitely an improvement to Captain America The First Avenger. It had more action, a little bit of comedy and some lovable characters. The first time I saw this movie I was like 'So awesome!' I mean it's one of the best Marvel movies I've seen. It also had a better and more interesting story. It made me get hyped for its next movie Captain America Civil War. I hope they can make the next movie awesome too. In conclusion, Captain America The Winter Soldier was such an awesome film. Marvel has a bright future of making more awesome movies like this one.",8,0,1,24 April 2015
Pacific Rim," A movie that unleashes your inner 9-year-old
","When I went to the cinema one time with my mom, I chose White House Down over Pacific Rim. I didn't want to see Pacific Rim at that time. Christmas of 2013 when I went to the DVD store and bought Pacific Rim because I was interested to watch it. I watched it and surprisingly, I loved it! I mean giant robots fighting giant monsters? It was so awesome! I haven't seen a movie like this before. Well I've seen some shows/cartoons etc that has giant robots and giant monsters but Pacific Rim is the first live action film that I've seen that has that. I got to admit, the story was kinda flat.. Things were predictable and it also has another useless love story. But it doesn't really bother that much. Too bad the ending really ended the story. There are news that Pacific Rim would have a sequel even though the 'Breach' has been destroyed I mean, where are kaijus going to come out? But I guess it wouldn't be a bad idea making a sequel of it.In conclusion, Pacific Rim is a fun and enjoying film. For sure you'll appreciate it",7,0,1,2 March 2015
Forrest Gump," One of the best movies I've seen
","As much as I love superhero and action movies, Forrest Gump is so far, the best movie I've seen. I loved how Tom Hanks played the role as Forrest. It was very moving. Forrest Gump's life can somehow be similar to every people's life. There will always be challenges and it could be hard but you can always go through it and succeed in life. That's what the movie is all about.Another thing is, there will be people that will help or make your life uneasy but all those people actually have a purpose, in reality and in the movie. Forrest Gump tells us that 'Life is like a box of chocolates, you'll never what you'll get.' Which in reality is also true. This movie has a lot of life lessons that you'll appreciate.In conclusion, Forrest Gump is such a great film. It has a great story and lovable characters. I gave it 9 stars because it's not the perfect movie. Maybe when I watch Pulp Fiction, The Godfather I and II or Shawshank Redemption, maybe I'll give one of those movies 10 stars.",9,1,1,21 June 2015
Ant-Man," Awesome And Funny
","It's very refreshing seeing a non-sequel Marvel movie. I loved Ant Man very much. The first 20 minutes was kinda boring but it gets interesting after those 20 minutes. The humor in this one is great. The story is pretty much good. But there are still flaws. First flaw is the villain, Darren Cross or Yellowjacket. He almost has no motivation as a villain. His background story wasn't enough, making his character underdeveloped. Second Flaw is, we only get to see Hank Pym as Ant Man on a very short footage. If there would be an Ant Man prequel and we'll see Hank Pym as Ant Man, I'd love to see it. But even with these flaws, it's still a lovable Marvel movie.In conclusion, Ant Man is awesome! Great humor and great story. It was a good treat.",7,2,9,17 July 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," A good start for Captain America
","Captain America The First Avenger was somehow a good origin story for Captain America. I really don't get why some people hated this movie. Maybe because of its advance technology even from the 40's? Well this is the Marvel Universe and that is something to consider.At first, I enjoyed watching it. But then when I was mature enough to watch it again, I realized that this movie was only made just to set-up The Avengers movie. The same thing goes for Thor. But Thor lacks the origin story that it became an obligatory movie. But this movie tells us the details of the story of Steve Rogers from when he was still skinny until he became the super soldier. Captain America The First Avenger is better than Thor. In conclusion, Captain America The First Avenger is somewhat an okay movie. Not good, not bad but it'll leave you satisfied.",7,0,0,2 March 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Amazing at its finest
","Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation has gotta be the best Mission Impossible movie ever. Maybe next to Ghost Protocol. I mean it was super awesome and amazing! It really made my day.For starters, the characters are very likable even the villains. It had the right amount of comedy and action on it. The only downside is that the story is a little bit confusing but it is understandable. Overall it's still an awesome movie.In conclusion, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation is amazing! It was great, it was awesome and it was amazing. A great action movie for this year.",8,1,5,22 August 2015
Captain America: Civil War," Another Great Marvel Movie
","This is another great Captain America movie. It not only serves as a sequel to the Captain America: The Winter Soldier but it also does to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. Kinda unique when you think about it. Obviously it doesn't follow the Civil War comics but Marvel still managed to make a great movie out of it. Even with many (or few) characters, it still worked and were all shown well in the movie. The characters too are very lovable. The action was again, awesome. The story was great also. It was hard for me to find some nitpicks in this movie but there are only two. It's not that complicated though. In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is another great Marvel movie. It's a great movie filled with the right amount of action, comedy. thrill and excitement! You won't be disappointed.",8,22,43,30 April 2016
Non-Stop," Only good when you see it for the first time
","The first time I saw Non-Stop, I was very entertained because of the huge suspense in it. Very thrilling though. I walked out of the theaters and I was satisfied for the day. Months later, I bought a DVD copy of Non-Stop and watched it again for the second time. What I realized is that the suspense is absent because I am already aware who the threat in the movie is. That's what I found disappointing. It's not that kind of movie that is re-watchable.Other than that, Liam Neeson did another great performance as a bad-ass character. What I find ridiculous is, is the bad guy's plan. Framing an air marshal from hijacking because of 9/11? Really ridiculous or maybe the bad guy is that just crazy. Anyway I still liked the movie.In conclusion, Non-Stop is great but not re-watchable. The movie is only good for people who saw it first time.",7,0,1,2 June 2015
X-Men: Apocalypse," Cool but not great
","When the movie began, it has this very exciting feeling I have. That's because the story telling is good. There were a lot of cool scenes in this movie like Quicksilver saving everyone from the explosion of the school, Wolverine slashing his way out of the military base, Jean Grey releasing her full potential and many more. Even with so many cool scenes, there are also things that came to disappointment. For example, Apocalypse. They actually killed him off in this movie which is pretty underwhelming. Not all of Apocalypse's powers were shown. Psylocke just went away for no apparent reason. Apocalypse's real goal isn't clear either. It's sad to say that this movie isn't as good/great as X-Men: Days Of Future Past.In conclusion, X-Men Apocalypse is a cool movie. Lots of cool scenes but it has its flaws.",7,2,8,22 May 2016
Big Hero 6," Fun and Incredible!
","Big Hero 6 is awesome! One of the best Disney movies I've seen. This movie is less cliché than the other movies which is a good thing because we are able to see something new. The story was well written and the characters were introduced properly. Things happen in an unexpected way. Same goes for this movie because it's unpredictable and I like it that way. Another thing I like in this movie is that it can mix our emotions. There are scenes that are fun, also there are sad scenes. I thought Baymax was really going to be stuck inside the portal but later on we learn that his 'memory card' is on Baymax's rocket arm. That scene made me happy at the end of the movie. And also, the funniest scene is the end credits scene where Fred sees his dad which surprisingly, is Stan Lee. Not only it had a good ending but it also had a funny end credits scene. In conclusion, Big Hero 6 is an awesome movie. It satisfied me. Safe to say it is a child friendly movie (because it's Disney).",8,42,61,28 February 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," Totally Awesome!
","Guardians Of The Galaxy is the best Marvel movie ever made so far. There are many things I can say to this movie. It was awesome, it was funny, it was beautiful and so on and so forth. It's a good feeling seeing something new on the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story was so good that you won't realize it's kinda cliché (a little). Like for example, the hero's parent is dying cliché or that one part when the villain doesn't finish/kill the hero cliché (that part when Star Lord was dancing in front of Ronan). But just because it had that doesn't mean it was bad but of course, almost all superhero movies are like that. In conclusion, Guardians Of The Galaxy is a must watch especially those to Marvel fans out there. Fun, awesome and amazing!",8,1,3,7 February 2015
Jurassic World," Mediocre but Great
","There has been already four Jurassic movies. Jurassic World is my second favorite. It manage to become much much better than The Lost World and Jurassic Park III. For starters, the characters are almost memorable but likable. Except for the fat asshole that got eaten by one of the raptors. Anyway, the special effects were great, the dinosaurs looked more real with its improved CGI. I like the way it pays homage to the original Jurassic Park where Gray and Zach explores the old park. Other than that, the plot was really too tragic. I mean dinosaurs running/flying around freely on an island filled with people. Obviously a lot of people died in this movie than in the last three movies. The best part has got to be the fight between the T-rex from the first movie and the Indominus Rex. That's all for this one. In conclusion, Jurassic World is great but not as good as the original. Even at first I wasn't expecting much for this.",7,5,14,12 October 2015
Avengers: Age of Ultron," It will make you excited for future Marvel movies
","I just saw it on theaters this morning. It was great! It starts with the action right away. This movie made me more excited for future Marvel movies and I know I'm not alone.There are parts in the movie that bothered me like when the huge rock from the city actually floated, it looked cartoon-ish. The characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were under developed. And the part where Quicksilver died. Well I guess it's not that bad. I can say a lot for this movie. The post credits scene made me excited for Avengers Infinity War. It shows Thanos taking his gauntlet (without the infinity stones) then saying 'I'll do it myself.'In conclusion, Avengers Age Of Ultron is awesome! Way better than the first Avengers movie.",7,2,6,1 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Most realistic superhero movie ever
","Batman is one of my favorite DC heroes ever. I've seen the old Batman movies such as the Batman 1989 and Batman Returns and so are the bad Batman movies that I am not going to mention. But this movie, The Dark Knight, has kicked it! From beginning to end it's awesome. There was no other superhero movie that has been as realistic as this one. Sure, I do love some Marvel movies like The Avengers and Captain America The Winter Soldier and they were actually good but those movies lacked the realism. In conclusion, The Dark Knight is a 'must watch' movie. Especially to those DC fans out there.",8,1,2,7 February 2015
Thor," Felt like it was a rushed movie
","The first time I saw Thor on theaters, I honestly got amazed. When I got to watch it again on HBO, it got different the way I see it. So yeah, Thor was punished by his father and sent him to Earth without his powers. Then he only stayed on Earth for like 2 and a half days. Then Thor saved two worlds in one day. What I'm trying to say is, everything happened so quickly. But still, the actors did a good job portraying their characters especially Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Tom Hiddleston as Loki. It really blends in together. In conclusion, Thor is okay, even with a rushed story. There are still good parts left.",7,1,3,24 April 2015
Iron Man," Very Great!
","First of all, Iron Man is truly awesome! Every scene was great and there was almost no boring parts in the movie. Iron Man is the best out of the three. Iron Man 2 was boring and Iron Man 3 was just disappointing. Iron Man was a part where the Marvel Cinematic Universe began. And yes, it was a good start. But the sad part is the last 2 movies left a legacy of mediocrity. At least it had the chance to redeem itself through the movie The Avengers. Maybe, Iron Man would redeem itself again on Avengers Age Of Ultron.In conclusion, Iron Man was great! A good start to the franchise and the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe.",8,3,4,5 March 2015
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The best 'okay' superhero film I've seen
","I've seen a lot of 'okay' superhero movies like Ant-Man, Thor: The Dark World, Man Of Steel, The Wolverine and more. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is an 'okay' movie but this has to be my favorite among the 'okay' superhero movie. I'll start with the things I liked in this movie. Ben Affleck as Batman/Bruce Wayne is very good. The fight scene of Batman and Superman is great. The way the other Justice League characters like Aquaman, Cyborg and The Flash are shown is very interesting. The Knightmare scene is also pretty interesting too. The part where Superman's body is heavily damaged from the nuclear explosion is very similar to what happened in The Dark Knight Returns Part 2; it makes a very clever easter egg. That's about it for this movie's positives.Second is the nitpicking parts in this movie. Bruce's parents died on a sidewalk rather than an alley (Crime Alley to be exact); in which I think they missed an important detail. The part where Bruce fell on a hole in the forest then levitating back up with the help of bats, still kinda confused with that to be honest. Well I guess that's all for here.Third is the things I hated in this movie. Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor was an idiotic decision. Lex is not supposed to be super crazy; he may have been crazy in the comics but not as crazy as the movie suggests. Doomsday is not the appropriate villain; it should've been Bizzaro. Also Doomsday's origin is complete bullsh*t! He wasn't made by Lex, He was made by a Kryptonian scientist. I hope this Doomsday in the film would stay dead. That's about it for this movie's negatives.In conclusion, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is an okay superhero movie. It's not great, it's not bad either. An easily recommendable movie.",7,3,7,2 April 2016
Thor: The Dark World," Another Improvement
","Thor The Dark World is good. Definitely an improvement to the first one. It had more action, its storyline was more interesting and the special effects were great. Marvel did a good job again on making movies. The storyline was interesting because of the new characters and the new worlds.It also gave us some new characters that are likable in a way. Another thing I liked in this movie is that it'll make you hyped from its coolness. Yes, there may be boring parts but those only takes a while.In conclusion, Thor The Dark World is good. It was such a satisfying movie. Now, I really can't wait its next sequel Thor Ragnarok.",7,0,1,28 April 2015
Godzilla," Far from my expectation
","Godzilla 2014 was not good, neither was it bad. It was summer when I had enough money to buy a ticket to see Godzilla. I wanted to see it badly but my mom didn't let me so I didn't. I waited for its DVD release then I bought it. I was so excited that I immediately put the disc on my DVD player. After I watched it then I said to myself, 'Good thing I didn't see this on the big screen.' I mean the movie was 2 hours long then Godzilla's screen time is only 10-11 minutes? It really disappointed me.Well about the movie, the story is kinda flat but it had great cast. Too bad Bryan Cranston's character died early in the movie. The only scenes that I liked in the movie was the final fight where Godzilla fights the MUTO. Well at least it was better than the Godzilla 1998. Disappointing but still it had its good parts.In conclusion, Godzilla 2014, again, is not good neither was it bad.",7,1,2,25 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Action packed!
","I only saw this movie because of the upcoming The Force Awakens movie. Of course before I watch The Force Awakens, I need to see the other Star Wars movie, then I started with Episode IV. It was good? Not only good, it was great! Especially its special effects. Was it action packed? Yes it is! The actors in this movie did a great job on portraying their characters. Speaking of characters, they were actually likable especially my favorite, Han Solo who was played Harrison Ford.I gotta admit, the first parts were kinda boring but it gets well when the action starts. That's why I give it 7 stars. I'll still continue on seeing the other Star Wars movies then I'll try to review them.In conclusion, Star Wars is a great film! I really appreciate it and probably one of the best sci-fi movies I've seen.",8,0,0,21 April 2015
