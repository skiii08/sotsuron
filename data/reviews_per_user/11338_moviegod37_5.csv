Raiders of the Lost Ark," Makes me feel like a kid!!!
","I was only 6 or 7 years old the first time I saw Raiders of the Lost Ark.  I remember being inspired to take a shovel and try to find buried artifacts in my yard, but I had forgotten just how much the movie captured my imagination until I watched it again years later. I could watch this movie just about every day of the week, and it makes me feel like a kid every time.  It is the absolute perfect combination of action, humor, script, music, and acting.  Special effects have gotten better, and other action flicks have given better adrenaline rushes, but the only one that comes close to capturing childhood fantasy quite like this is 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.  If anyone ever creates a hero more fun and interesting than Indy, then he will have accomplished something miraculous.",Null,0,0,7 August 2001
Se7en," Serial Killer movie done right!
","It is a rare studio film (at least in 1995, when Seven was released) that has the cojones to be this dark, sinister, and depressing.  Yet, despite the dark tones and cynical view of the world, the film is totally mesmerizing. Great performances by Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  Also, a completely chilling, albeit brief, portrayal of the killer by a now-famous uncredited actor.My only gripe about the film is that it is a bit overstylized by Fincher. Honestly, it can't be dark and rainy 24 hours a day. But, for the most part, the style benefits the film.  Still, you may find yourself wishing someone in the film would flip on a light switch every now and then.The way the movie builds up is nervewracking.  In the beginning, you find out that a killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his M.O.  You learn what these sins are, and then you begin to wonder what will happen next.  How will the next person be killed?  With each graphic and disturbing death, there is a greater sense of horror and disbelief.  The murders sound outlandish, but the realism of the film keeps each killing resting uncomfortably in the back of your mind. Also, unlike most Hollywood thrillers, you never actually see the murders happen, but see enough images that you can imagine each brutal scene. I think that adds to the dramatic value of the crime scenes. It is definately worth noting that this film is not for the squeamish.The first time I saw Seven, the ending absolutely blew me away.  Some may argue that it is predictable, but I think Fincher merely gives enough information to make you suspect that the ending may occur.  He then builds up the tension until you are dying to have your suspicions confirmed.  The first time I watched it, I truly couldn't believe what I had just seen. Almost like I wanted to believe it didn't happen.  It is as powerful and memorable of an ending as I have ever seen.Many imitators have tried to use a similar formula, but then put in some cheap, Hollywood ending that ruins the film (ie, The Bone Collector).  If you want to see a serial killer movie done right, watch Seven.",Null,0,0,26 July 2001
Cast Away," Outstanding.
","The difficulty of carrying an entire movie alone must be tremendous... Yet Tom Hanks succeeds in Cast Away.  This modern, high tech retelling of the man on desert island tale is outstanding in every way.  Wonderful acting, excellent direction, and ,despite its simplicity, an engaging story.  Also, some interesting themes about fast paced, modern life. Pretty much everything has already been said about this movie, but I want to recommend seeing this one on DVD!  There are many many extras that add insight to the film.  For example, in Robert Zemeckis' alternate audio track, he tells you that Fed Ex paid nothing to be put into this film, but that it had been a part of the story line from day one because it fit so well with the way they wanted the Chuck Noland character to be...  I found that reassuring after hearing so many friends said the movie was a Fed Ex commercial...  Anyway, go for the DVD version... if you have a good surround sound system, you will really be able to appreciate the excellent sound effects which are another big part of carrying this film.",Null,0,0,3 August 2001
American Beauty," Love it or hate it...
","This is a movie that will divide households.  Either you will watch it and feel as though you related to each character or you will think they are all really twisted people who complain too much.  Honestly, if you can't somehow relate to the characters, then you are probably an ego maniac ('Never underestimate the power of denial').   The idea here is that nobody is perfect, and the hardest thing to do in life is know your flaws. Each of the characters has major flaws, and that is why it is hard to like them. The process of learning what each character is hiding under the surface will either bore you or intrigue you.  The movie has many genuinely funny moments, and all the acting is brilliant.  It is very rare that a movie this funny can be so unsettling.  So, if you're looking for thoughtless Saturday night fare... you will hate this...go rent something else.  If you want to see something memorable that you will want to watch again, watch American Beauty.",Null,0,0,2 August 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Greatest War Movie Ever
","Spielberg set out to create a war movie unlike anything ever seen, and he succeeded brilliantly.  The visual style puts you right there on Omaha Beach.  The handheld cameras take away the clean, rehearsed feel that can hurt movies that need to rely on realism.  I could go on all day about the film's first half hour- the D-day invasion... but everything the needs to be said about it has already been said.  Suffice to say that it will leave you gasping for air. The story is fairly simple, but it works.  Mostly, it exists for the purpose of developing each character further.  Each character gets at least one moment to reveal himself, and to say something about the nature of men at war.  It can seem a bit preachy at times, but it fits with the pull no punches, unapolagetic nature of the film. The acting is absolutely brilliant.  A great ensemble with no weak individual performances (except possibly Edward Burns-playing the same wise-ass city boy he does in every movie).  My personal favorite performance is that of Giavonni Ribisi.  He brings very convincing honesty to every line he delivers. Anyway, this is one of those movies that everyone needs to see sometime. It sheds new light on one of the most important events in history, while telling a good story at the same time.",Null,1,2,2 August 2001
