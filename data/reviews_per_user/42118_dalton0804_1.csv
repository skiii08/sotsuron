Sucker Punch," Surprisingly awesome
","I think Zack Synder must suffer from ADHD judging by this film, and thats not a bad thing. I've been a fan of his since Dawn of the dead, not a fan boy but I like his style over substance filmmaking, he's certainly better and more consistent then a lot of other big budget directors out there.Right from the start we are in the familiar Snyder-isms of CGI and slow motion. Complaints about the lack of story are valid but then that's not the point of this film. Its purely a visual experience and as such it delivers in spades.Coupled with the sheer beauty of Emily Browning's eyes and game performances from all involved, this is great, not perfect, summer entertainment. I think that Synder continues to grow and develop as a filmmaker, and I look forward to his Superman film.",8,8,14,20 April 2011
