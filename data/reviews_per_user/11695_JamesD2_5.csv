United 93," Surprisingly understated. Surpassed expectations
","I have to tell you that I really did not intend to see this movie. I have to confess to being numb on the subject of 911 due to the overdose of it in the media over the last 6 years. I was really expecting this to be in the line of 'win one for the red and blue' and all that but it surprisingly was not at all. It was the most realistic movie I may have seen. Of course one can roll their eyes at such a statement considering the subject matter, but the acting was really understated which is almost unheard of in these types of flicks. In fact, due to the subject matter, this would have given them a license to go over the top with the melodrama, but they did not.The director really showed both sides of the story here to an extent with respect to the fact that the terrorists were nervous as well and both sides were praying to their various Gods. You really got the chilling feeling the moment the passengers heard that two planes hit the towers as it probably took them a few minutes to process that information and what exactly it meant. It also really captured the confusion in the air traffic control towers as basically it took time for people to realize what was going on and nobody really knew what to do. What could they have done really? Not much in retrospect.Anyway, I really can't stand melodramatic movies. What a shock it was that this was the LEAST melodramatic disaster film I have ever seen when it could very, very easily have been the most.I am burnt out on the media overkill of 911, yet this movie still managed to be perhaps the most intense movie I have ever seen.",9,2,4,13 September 2007
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Boring Stupid Movie
","7.6? Have you all gone mad? This movie sucked. I laughed about 3 times.Painful to watch. As with all romantic comedies, once it hits the dreaded one hour mark, go away because the 'comedy' part goes and is replaced by the 'romance'.In other words zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.And the first 50 minutes were no prize either.If you are a straight male, do not be convinced by your significant (or insignificant) other to endure this crap.If you want to see something funny have haven't seen before, go rent Saxondale. Or see The UK version of The Office again.Americans make comedy. Britian makes humour.The jokes in Crazy, Stupid Love were so obvious and predictable, I was covering my head with a blanket to stop the agony.I remember when my baby had an infection and she was pooping all over the place. Cleaning that up was more fun than watching this movie. Because after 20 minutes, you were done. This just kept on going on and on and on.",3,17,34,1 December 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Most overrated film of the year
","This movie was poor. I was bored out of my mind. Maybe the first 20 minutes of so was somewhat interesting as there was a big chase scene. That was followed by another chase scene. Which was followed by...well you get the drift. Actually this is all not true. The entire movie was one big chase scene. It is difficult to find a part where there was not a chase scene. Maybe if Bourne walked for 10 seconds that was a new scene. Each camera shot was one or two seconds max. It was MTV style direction. Total headache inducing cinematography. There was virtually no plot at all. I was bored. This is a good movie to go see at a drive in because you can talk throughout the whole second half of the movie and not miss a thing. This got a 8.4 on IMDb??? I was scanning the movie theaters yesterday and no less than six (6) movies were granted with a 8 rating or higher...in one theater alone. For perspective, a 7.9 was the #250 top movie of all time. Give me a break. People are getting way generous with these 8s these days. Talk about grade inflation. If you liked 'Independence Day' or 'Armegeddon' and 'films' of that ilk, then perhaps you will like this. If you have a brain, do not go see this movie.",2,4,8,16 September 2007
Ex Machina," SLllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow
","I can't believe I watched this whole movie. Pretty much nothing happens until the end. And the end was not worth the wait.There is no way this movie is a 7.7. There must be some people below 21 who rated this highly because everything in here is been there and done that. This movie is so slow. It just goes on and on and on.I came on here just to warn people who think 'Hmmmm...sci fi with a 7.7, I'll think I'll give that a try.' Believe me, you won't miss a thing if you skip this one.Well my review is done and I submitted it. But it got rejected because it does not have 10 lines of text. So I'll drag out this review just like this movie.Oh yeah...I was thinking the whole time I was watching this...this would be perfect for a half hour episode of the Twilight Zone. Maybe if there is some Twilight Zone clone that lasts an hour, you can stretch it out for that long. But you really can do the whole basic story in a half hour.",4,2,7,8 November 2015
Stranger Than Fiction," Liberal crap
","This is one of those liberal pretentious movies. You know, like Wes Anderson movies. The ones that seem think they are oh so clever but aren't. The ones that liberals certainly rated higher than conservatives.The first 20 minutes or so did pull me in. It had a good premise. But that was it. It kept on going on and on and on. It would have been a good 30 minute Twilight Zone episode...maybe 60 minutes at the most. Absolute most. It just dragged on and went nowhere.I guess I have to make 10 lines of text to get this review published. That is what this movie felt like. It just kept on going to fill up its required space.",3,1,6,2 December 2016
