The Blair Witch Project," The scariest film I have ever seen
","I was 15 and desperate to see this film when it was released, I was finally allowed to watch it on Halloween night. Alone in my room. In the dark. I consider this the scariest film ever as the 'bad guy' is never seen, only suggested. The tension felt between the characters is intense. The children heard in the woods at 2am crying sent shudders down my spine. You could tell the actors were scared themselves. No other film has had the effect of sheer terror on me as the Blair Witch Project has. It was a ground breaking piece of film that will forever stand the test of time.",10,2,4,3 October 2014
