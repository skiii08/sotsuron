The Blair Witch Project," Brings out instinctive fear from within you.
","I wasn't sure if I should watch this movie or not.  With all the hype that surrounded it, I thought it would turn out to be something purely commercial.  I was mistaken however.  The way the movie was shot, gives you a sense of 'Help!  I'm lost in the woods with these guys!'  Heather was just great. You could see the fear in her eyes and feel it in her breath.  What a movie it would be if she were to tandem in another horror alongside Haley Joel Osment of Sixth Sense fame!!",9,1,2,10 December 1999
