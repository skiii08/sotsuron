Resident Evil: Afterlife," Very disappointing ending!
","The film starts off impressively with a great battle scene, however the films pace slows down considerably after the opening battle scene.The prison fortress that Mila lands on takes up most of the meat of the film, but very little seems to happen in here. And the dialogue is well....... here's an example from one of the main protagonists:'What the hell is that thing!'The abandoned prison also houses Chris Redfield played by Wentworth Earl Miller III of 'Prison break' fame...... Chris Redfield, his sister Clare and Alice & co all escape from this abandoned prison. Was the selection of Wentworth Miller because of great casting....or was it because he gets to 'break out' of prison......and his inclusion is nothing more than a wink/in joke to Prison Break!The ending is pretty poor and very anticlimactic, there is a a sequel on the way as the ending makes clear but I would have preferred not to have to wait another year or 2 just to see part 2 of this movie!It could have been much much better!",5,16,34,10 September 2010
Centurion," Battles, Blood & Warrior Women....what's not to like?
","This is a straight forward tale of a band of Roman soldiers being hunted down by Pict warriors in the stunning surroundings of the Scottish mountains.Whilst the dialogue and script won't exactly win any Oscars, the film was entertaining enough with plenty of blood & guts fighting scenes.Olga Kurylenko was actually quite convincing in her portrayal of a brutal ice cold warrior, much better than Keira Knightley's portrayal of a female warrior in King Arthur. Perhaps Olga not having to utter a word in the entire film as she portrays a Pict who had her tongue cut out was a clever way to make her character more cold and mysterious.I wouldn't quite go as far as one of the previous posters who describes the first major battle scene on a par with the opening scene in 'Gladiator'. Indeed some of the small criticisms I would level would be the use of very fast action shots during some of the fight scenes, i.e the camera motion is faster than your eye can register, think opening car chase in 'Quantom of Solace' and you get the picture.What really stands out in the film though is the stunning back drop of the Scottish mountains, It's like 'Highlander' all over again only better!Centurion, doesn't carry the 'epic' status as other movies like 'Gladiator','Braveheart' or 'Kingdom of heaven', no it's on a much smaller scale and doesn't really spend too much time on character development on either the Pict or Roman sides. I suppose in a way it helps this film as it doesn't get bogged down in lengthy dialogue, but concentrates more on action.Whilst this film won't score too highly on the originality stakes, it's a good effort in an all too neglected genre.",7,94,131,27 April 2010
