Ford v Ferrari," facts vs fiction
","As much as i liked this movie for what it is, fictional. based on true events. but this isnt a true story. some of the basic facts are in there but when a movie based on history should be as historical as that history. creative licensing is a stupid way to make any movie.
the time line is out. ford started this project without shelby, shelby came later after ford lost his first two tries at le mans. miles drove in the race the movie said that he had to stay home for.
where are all the other cars? for a hundred million dollar budget, they could have at least used some stock footage to show all the other cars in all the other classes that are involved also.
where was the winner's podium? ford and all others protesting that miles should be awarded first prize.
why was ford and his crony made to be villians? after all, it was his company, his cars and his race. why add the fake conflict?ive seen movies using all the facts from history without distortion. i thoroughly enjoyed them more knowing what i was watching was completely true. and if ive ever enjoyed a movie then later found out the facts were distorted, it ruins the entire experience.",6,1,2,14 February 2020
Aquaman," very young adolescent comic book on screen.
","Cuz im not a teen anymore and probably have seen to many movies; this movie is,
king arthur pulling the sword from the stone. and his knights of the round table.
lots of lord of the rings stuff, giant stone statues, giant monsters of various sizes including a kracken, etc,
starwars stuff, flying ships through lots of tight spaces, even if underwater. a space battle with lots of dogfighting fighter ships and battle ships, all underwater.
if they can swim so fast, why do they need ships, or even the boat?
a bit of harry potter with the hidden world of the undersea people and even some moana stolen plot lines of the bottom of the ocean air bubble and its creatures.when are they going to have an actual hero that sought out and wants to be a hero? and not someone who is resisting and has to be trained while everyone else who is completely trained and educated sit around waiting and dying.how many die in the battle only to have the two leaders have mommy make them behave themselves and shake hands to be friends again? i thought was just as story killing as both of them have a mom named martha, even if she was mom to both.
rules of physics kept changing. sometimes the tridents could go through metal without any problems, other times it didnt even scratch, the same metal. can jump out of an airplane a thousand feet up and not get hurt, falls a few feet and gets hurt.
girl beats the crap of out the guards without any problem, then runs like hell from another guard just like the others.
in the beginning the sub, stolen by our bad guy, to shoot at who? the guy who he already has a deal with to start a war so that the shooting sub will make him want to start a war?????????????????
like i said, this movie is great for younger teens. logic is out the window so many times but its a lot of fun to watch if you ignore that. if you can ignore that. i couldnt. if this was a one off never seen before, first of its kind, i would have blasted it, more than i already did :) as a well informed adult with to many movies seen, i give this a 5.5 out of ten. 9 out of ten for everything visual, sfx, acting, dialogue etc. minus 4 points for the plot holes. and that is being generous.
it wasnt at all the aquaman i saw on tv cartoons as a kid, nor in comic books. i missed how much he relied on the animals of the seas for help and him, not his girlfriend, using waterballs as a weapon. and there was no hint, not in the late 60's and early 70's when i watched and read about this character, of an entire underwater kingdom. one that could easily outnumber the surface world. it is 3 times its size and the tech they got? we wouldnt stand a chance. but, like harry potter, they give the right of way to a bunch of ignorant morons like us. i doubt it. they would rule our asses off and probably better at it too.",10,1,4,24 January 2019
Oblivion," seems backwards
","its been a few years since I've seen this movie. I enjoyed all the eye candy along the way until I started thinking what it is all about. Aliens attack earth. all is lost except a random few left behind as watch dogs. but when you see it coming along the way, you find out Tom is a clone. He thinks he is a human protecting his assigned territory from the aliens hiding in the wild or such. but the aliens are really humans pretending to be aliens. why? for the movie's sake, its to protect Tom's delicate ego so it is not such a shock when he finally figures it all out. very elaborate therapy, for a clone. the movie tries to explain it so it will make sense but really its a slight of hand twist plot. but not like a card trick to entertain you, rather, if you realised it, is a pickpocket scam. the leads switched rolls not for the sake of the story but for the sake of the twist only.",Null,0,1,24 January 2017
The Caine Mutiny," relived of command
","Well made, well acted. one big flaw. The Captain was sick and after all the abuse he put the other officers and crew through, but the time he asked the other officers for help, who would have trusted him? To be fair, the other officers could have relieved him of command at that point. They probably should have been reprimanded for not doing so at that time and not during the storm, when in the court ruling he is found to be sick. being sick and in so a danger to the ship and everyone on it. not penalised, not so easy to have that done without going through what they did do through anyways, a mutiny trial. So why is the lawyer upset? Doesn't make sense to me. Queeg was sick, asking for help or not. When the biggest, baddest school bully comes up to you to ask for help, what do you do when he has never been proved trust worthy before? And yet the film goes out of its way to vilify the innocent mutineers.",6,3,8,11 June 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," predictable and clichéd
","mediocre sequel. question; who's fault is that? answer; its the audience and the producers who want to make money from them more then to entertain them with originality and entertainment. this was more of a remake than a sequel. while i'm in the audience, i kept hearing the neanderthals either complaining certain stunts weren't repeated or cheering when stunts were repeated. so when you cater to the lowest common denominator, you cant make art, you only make a two hour commercial. the first was fairly original with a somewhat clichéd ending. the time travel part was cool but its not that hard to keep to the rules of science of physics. movies are crap when obvious rules are broken and sequels are worse when they ignore their own history. IE, flesh or flesh covered only, so how did the liquid robot pass through the time portal? the over used cliché of the doctor not believing the patient. that scene should have been first, t2 lands outside the hospital, rescues Sara, shocks the doc who was berating her about t2 and we all laugh. then together they find the punk kid who is to save the world. the ending narrative was good about its all new, creating a new time line without a paradox. that is until the sequels ruined that and got more commercially stupid. i do so hope the franchise ends with Sara Connor riding her scooter to work as the last scene of the last movie as the time paradox closes around them. why? because they couldn't come up with a better idea than the tired one of technology from our own future. how does that ever work? we are not smart enough now to invent what we did in the future so it couldn't ever exist then. does that mean Einstein ensured are technological history by sending the wheel back in time to the neanderthals such as the ones cheering in this audience? why do movie makers think we are stupid and/or don't care that we can actually understand more than a grade 3 level of logic. maybe pandering to the lower classes makes money, but so does being original or t1 wouldn't have been so successful and then there wouldn't be any sequels. as with many badly thought out sequels, the performances were good. its not their fault what lines were given to them. if not for the acting, i would have walked out of the theater. the sfx and action were good, except for the truck jumping into the canal and still keeps going and then is able to out accelerate a very agile dirt bike. maybe the truck should have been part of the liquid robot too.",5,3,13,30 July 2017
Avengers: Endgame," a reunion show more than an avengers movie.
","I didn't like end game much. to long. to slow. to sloppy, to weak of a plot. to many cameos.thanos had to much physical power, all the other superheros got their power from outside sources, his was never explained. is it supposed to be his is born that way? even in infinity war he had to much physical strength. of which i didnt like the beginning of showing the end of 'thor, ragnorock, victorious ending being totally useless. a better ending and more tense/suspenseful scene would have been showing them fly off towards thanos ship in waiting.if thanos got his strength from some unnatural method, i missed that being explained. then why no others like him? comics say he is a titan. why no other titans?the key points in the movie's end fight scenes were far to subtle and why did iron man have to die because he used the glove? it was never explained. thanos never suffered using them, only destroying them. and so many others had it, why didn't they use it? even if it would kill them, whether they knew it would kill them or not, they could have ended it all instantly.the time travel thing was oh so sloppy. seems it was used only to go over the list of all the other movies. was more like a reunion documentary than an actual movie. bored the crap out of me. and the stupid mistakes made me upset.so now they have all the stones, with or without a glove, why did they need time travel machines to go back again to replace them? wouldnt the stones have let them do what they wanted to do, restoring any history they wished, one without thanos? and they could have brought back vision, why didnt they? etc etc etc.captain marvel was vastly wasted. so was her haircut. what was the point of that? she said she was needed elsewhere? who cares whats happening in the rest of the universe when its not going to matter after the glove puts it all back right. the only and the smartest thing about the movie was when thanos took her power stone to beat her. that was the best 10 seconds in the movie. but with that stone, they should have been equal. but then not equal because thanos isnt strong enough to smash entire ships by himself like captain marvel is. she is, without a doubt, by far the strongest character and that strength was not used.oh ya, that the glove just had to get back to him was such a joke of a cliche. again, should have been used before. the center point of the movie should have been making use of the glove by other means.thanos and the glove. he is smart enough to build a vast empire, yet he can only think to use the glove to kill. not to created a better method of existence without killing? he not so smart after all. and neither are any of the others for not suggesting something of that sort.the time travel thing should have put it all back right from the point of before thanos snapped fingers. should have gone back to the point where star lord should have shot thanos and ended it all, and then actually shoot him and end it all. of which that star lord didnt shoot him was the stupidest and weakest part of infinity wars. he was going to kill him but got so upset at him that he didnt kill him. huh? how does that work? who else would not have instantly shot thanos upon hearing such news?the only thing this movie was successful for was giving out as many paycheques as possible. the most cameos any movie ever had. did they really need to do that? showing 3 second clips at the end in the credits of each actor would have been better. at least less boring.they didnt just want to end the story line, they wanted to end my interest in it also. i watched them all just to make sure i didnt miss anything that might have been worth while. some of the others were just great. this one was far from it.",4,33,52,8 May 2019
No Country for Old Men," emperor's new clothes
","if you like this movie because you think its good story telling, you are stupid. if you like it because it has some good acting, yes it does, and has some good looking filming, nice landscapes and angles and such, because it does, and lastly because it has some good dialogue, then you are a film student that has yet to pass your final tests and graduate.plot wholes. if you don't understand what they are, you are stupid. this movie is incomplete. there are no good incomplete movies. its missing about 20% of its story. not at the end like some movies were left off and still good. but intermittently throughout. how did the hit-man figure out who to chase down for the lost money? why did the hit-man kill just about everyone he came across? yes, he is nuts, so what. is he supposed to be just as stupid? people who like this incomplete movie frustrate and anger me because they heard someone say they liked it who was hot on the market and important at the time, and no other reason. the emperor's new clothes theory. or they were all stoned all to hell and cool clips and scenery didn't need connections to each other to make any sense. they don't care as long as the fireworks look cool. they are in it for the carnage, not the story. it doesn't need to make sense, just look cool like car accidents, regardless who is at fault.why do people say they love a movie that has some nice scenery in it? as so many reviewers here keep saying. how is that a good movie? get your sorry asses outside and look at it for yourself for free like its supposed to be. a good movie is complete, without plot holes. it makes sense. its a mathematical equation, if it doesn't add up, its wrong. this movie is a very good looking puzzle with to many important pieces missing, like all the plus signs needed in between the many digits before the equal sign at the end.",1,3,8,31 March 2017
Saving Private Ryan," this was a good telling of actual events of d-day.
","War is hell. retelling is is almost as hell. but,,,what i hated of this movie was seeing how the attack on d-day was so much like shooting fish in a barrel. how badly our side messed up our own soldiers. the landing boats were so stupidly designed. opening from the front instead of the side using the front as cover until it was somewhat safer to disembark. like shooting fish in a barrel. they were fish. the boats were the barrel. why couldnt the boats have landed and then soldiers fired from there for their own cover? why couldnt a lot of thing happened that could have not ended is such a huge loss of life?
how many died by the overly simplistic strategy of flooding the beach until the enemy was overrun?
artillery by land. by ship. bombs by plane. were used but, this battle was sloppy. i know all the other details about this battle. all the hardships and time constraints due to the weather. but there was no lack of time for planning. so what happened? they claimed they didnt know how much defence were waiting for them on the beach. for all they already knew, how is this true?
the higher ups didnt care about the expendable individual. how many did they think was needed? add enough more to make sure it works. it did work.",8,0,0,13 November 2018
Insidious," some effective scary moments but to much taking from other scary movies to call itself original
","i find it very hard to be scared or shocked when i can see them coming. it doesn't matter what kind of movie really, the older i get the more I've seen the harder it is to see something original.i was surprised at some of the attempts to shock or scare me and they were very effective. but all i all, i have seen this movie in to many other movies that in themselves may not have been all that original either. i guess that would depend how old i was when i saw, say, poltergeist and how many movies I've seen before. yes, it very obviously stole from that movie. a child being used to get the message across to the living from the ghosts, and mommy, this time daddy, going into the other realm to get baby back. i found it a bit amusing to see Barbara Hershey in a movie about a ghost that follows the victim from house to house as in the 1982 movie she stared in, the entity, supposedly based on a true story.many reviews cite many movies that have been borrowed from that i have not seen or even heard of. thats just shameful. there is only so much borrowing you can do without calling it a remake of some sort even if its remaking several movies at once. even at that, some of the scares were scary, not all, but some. then again i was tired and getting shocked out of my sleep only helped the effect of the shock and i cant re-watch it to see if the shock is just as effective now that I'm wide awake. and no, the movie was not so boring it put me to sleep at the end of a very long day. star wars would have put me to sleep then.",6,1,2,22 April 2013
The Sixth Sense," slight of hand pick pocket instead of magic
","big time spoiler alerts so go away if you haven't seen the movie yet. or even if you have and enjoyed it. plot holes always ruin it for me. plot holes, like bad math. very simple math. if it doesn't add up, its wrong. if the equation is long enough with more digits than able to easily keep track of, then the mistakes are more easily missed. this guy shammer the scammer is bad at math and is only good enough at slight of hand to pick your pocket and run away with your money. i love a good magic trick where i know I'm being fooled but i cant ever see how. but picking my pocket, i know you fooled me but only long enough for me to look the other way in trust you are entertaining me, not picking my pocket. Bruce dies, in the beginning, but we are not 'officially' told this until the supposedly twist ending, and then becomes a friend of a kid who sees dead people. but the red hearings we keep seeing to keep us from this twisted are misleading and in the end, i felt betrayed. the kids sees dead people, Bruce is dead. all the other dead people's wounds can be seen, not Bruce's. not until the end. misleading. all the scenes where the kid starts talking to Bruce, he is supposed to be interacting with the kid's mom or others and such. its supposed to be cool that he isn't really and we are not supposed to notice that. so in the end, we are only tricked into thinking this. but as the rest of the dead people are replaying out what was their life before they died or how they died. Bruce is on an unknown to him mission. very good idea if properly written into the movie. but what ruins it is the kid must know Bruce is dead and says nothing about it. all the rest of the dead people scare the crap out of this kid, but not dead Bruce. and then why does Bruce not realize no one else but the kid is answering him? the unknown mission is to save the second daughter from being poisoned to death by her mom. again, the kid is scared of the ghost girl first daughter while she leads him to the video she made of mom poisoning her. OK, cool, but why didn't she run away instead? but that whole bit seemed so out of place with the rest of the movie even if you did know the twist. why not have the twist realized before this part and then realize that's why Bruce is stuck haunting this kid to finish this mission. otherwise, how did Bruce and the kid really find out about Munchhausen mom? how is it not better to have a tighter better written script with the same twists?",3,6,13,31 March 2017
The Social Network," wrong movie for the title. it was boring and clichéd
","if mr zuck didn't like this movie, he should have financed his own and overseen the production, starting with the script. that probably wouldn't have been any more accurate than this movie was. i bet the mediation to make sure ALL the facts of all those involved made it into the movie would take infinitely longer than the real life lawsuits shows in the movie. i tried watching it. for a movie about facebook, you know, the social network mentioned in the title, it was all about legal disputes. so what? could have covered all that in about five lines in an epilogue. so what about the book it was based on. boring book that didn't seem to cover the feel good parts of the happy accidents of the world choosing facebook over the already established yahoo360, friendster and myspace who paved the way for facebook that probably otherwise wouldn't exist. mark zuck and co didn't invent social networking as this movie seemingly gives them all the credit for. they got lucky. why was facebook infinitely more successful than its predecessors is what should have been covered as well. it should have also included why no other soc/net never tried after. mind you, twitter, instigram and such are doing well but not to the same extent. why did the world choose f/b over the rest?﻿",3,0,0,31 July 2017
