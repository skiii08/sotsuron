National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Waste of $8; should have waited for the DVD
","This movie was way too similar to the first. If not for Riley's added humor, this movie would not have even been worthy of renting. For example, in one of the final scenes, when they find the treasure, they light up a path just like in the first movie. Also, the actual action did not even start until three-fourths of the movie was over. If the second was this bad, I hope there will not be a third. They should of stopped while they were ahead. Do not waste your money on this movie while it is in theaters; wait until it is on DVD. Instead, save your money to go see Indiana Jones in May. And, while you are waiting for Indiana Jones 4, watch episodes of 24 and Monk, which are well worth your money.",4,2,6,22 December 2007
