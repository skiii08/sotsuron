Hereditary," Ending sucked
","Ending sucked, just like The Witch. Had so much opportunity, but it's obvious the director wants to make his magnum opus a rejection of Christianity and an homage to paganism. This might work for one or two films, but it won't last. Acting was wonderful, beautifully filmed. Ending was almost exactly the same as the director's previous movie. I felt awful after I watched a family destroyed because of paganism. Truly terrible.",4,0,0,22 August 2018
Shakespeare in Love," A fun parody of the life and work of Shakespeare
","People are missing the point of this movie-it is simply a parody of Shakespeare, his life, and work.Whether it works as such is up to the opinion of the viewer. Go in with this expectation and you won't be disappointed.",7,2,3,22 May 2019
Us," Not a good film
","I suppose this comment has been repeated a few times, but in all honesty, this film was not what is was hyped up to be. It had a lot of potential-good actors, good direction, good music. But the plot was asinine and completely contrived.I don't mind horror movies that leave you with a lot of questions. But this movie was 2 hours long, with oodles and oodles of 'explanation,' all of which really made no sense. Either the movie has to be abstract artwork, or metaphorical psychological horror..... or the explanations need to go away, because they just come across as plot holes.Biggest problem was the main character, and this huge gaping plot hole that is revealed at the end literally ruins the entire premise. I won't give away the ending, but if the lead character is in fact who she is revealed to be, there is no reason for her to be doing any of the things she is doing, nor her doppelgÃ¤nger.Absurd premise, absurd ending. Not worth the time or the money to see it. The 3-stars are for the pros I already mentioned. Didn't care for Get Out like others, but this one sealed the deal for me. I'm done with Peele's movies.",3,4,7,29 April 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Frustrating story of being consumed with anger
","This movie is well-acted, well-filmed, well-paced. Literally no complaints in these areas. The only minor issue I have are some script choices-McDormand's character has some quips that would seem better suited to a Jane Austin novel were it not for the constant f-words thrown in. And while the characters are quite complex and evolved well throughout the film, their spoken occasionally seem effusive for no real reason. But some script issues aside, this film was difficult to watch. Not because of the violence, or the subject matter. But because it is a story of characters completely consumed by grief, unfulfilled desires, hopelessness, and futility. This concept is not necessarily original, but the film provides an interesting story and definitely kept me engaged. The main thing to enjoy about this film is that all the characters are portrayed as flawed, deeply disturbed individuals, all finding was to cope with existence. Moving from one crisis to the next, they deal with life, make their mistakes, and continue on. My biggest issue (outside the script) is that no real people 'make this many mistakes' and don't go to jail. The film portrays Missouri as a sort of wild-west atmosphere where people take the law into their own hands (Molotov cocktails, arson, battery on minors while on school grounds throwing people out of windows-all done with literally no legal ramifications) This kind of behavior is just simply not the case any more in this country, and so it is an incredible suspension of disbelief being requested on the part of the viewer. But as a film, I thoroughly enjoyed it for the most part-if not solely for the acting of McDormand and Rockwell.",7,0,1,12 August 2018
Twilight," My sister made me watch this
","I could have been the first movie, or maybe one of the other ones. Does it matter?This movie was awful, just awful. Truly terrible. Horrible, no redeeming qualities. Bad makeup. TERRIBLE acting. A wretched script. Kristen Stewart constantly biting her lower lip and looking in every direction but at the person talking to her. And then it just got worse, because I realized it was trying to be a 'serious''movie. Did anyone on set think this was going to be given good reviews? Do not watch this movie. Completely uninteresting plot derived from a book thaf was written by a woman who very obviously wanted to be Bella, and have her little vampire romance.",1,2,3,28 July 2018
Climax," This passes for dancing?
","Really? I don't think so. I would never pay to see anyone 'dance' like this. Go on a diet people-dancers need to be size zero.Who knows what this movie is really about. Anyone who's done drugs knows this is not the way people act while tripping on acid. I've seen reviews that say it's conservative art propaganda. Or maybe it's just the director's own take on drugs after some of his own bad experiences.Honestly it doesn't really matter. There is no plot, nothing makes any sense, the acting isn't particularly good, and neither is the dancing. And it's especially disgusting to watch some odd looking woman urinate on the floor. And by the way, why would a woman, who didn't take any drugs, inflict self-harm at the advice of acid-tripping lunatics?I literally neither cared for, nor connected with any character in this 90 min bore-fest.Don't waste your time watching this film, it's pure garbage.",2,2,6,23 October 2019
A Quiet Place," Don't like horror/suspense? You'll love this movie!
","Great movie, all around, period. Suspenseful, interesting, and full of characters you actually care about. I wish Hollywood made more movies like this.",9,3,4,20 April 2018
Midsommar," Pretentious, highfalutin snoozefest.
","Why, oh why does IMBD not have an option to give zero stars? I was beyond excited to see this movie. I waited for each preview trailer, bought midnight premier tickets, couldn't wait to see it. I enjoyed Hereditary, but I thought the ending was terrible. I should have taken that as a hint.This movie was horrible-just horrible. It was like watching paint dry. It was way too long, the acting is an abomination, and no matter how good the cinematography is, it can't possibly make up for the ludicrous mess of a film I just saw. DO NOT listen to the critic reviews, or headlines. This movie is not scary, and it's certainly not suspenseful-because there's no climax to lead up to. What's worse, the ending smacks of repeat from Aster's previous film. He's a one-trick pony, and this film seals the deal. I didn't care about any of the characters, despite unresolved and totally unexplored backstory. They are complete idiots for staying for the entire pagan festival. Every activity, every scene is based on drugs, and why would anyone do any drugs while isolated in a village that seems to glorify death?The entire premise of the movie is predicated on an event that, had it not happened, none of the ensuing events would ever have taken place. Is this a yearly festival, or is it every 90 years? There sure were an awful lot of pictures of May Queens...the plot holes are endless. Out-of-place movie references (apparently this electricity-free village has a TV and access to movies from the 90s!) Rituals and games that make no sense and are never explained. Characters standing around in silence for no reason with bizarre looks on their faces. Gross shots of old naked people. Stupid jokes that made no one in the theater laugh. In fact, the entire audience was laughing at all the parts that were supposed to be serious moments. This is usually an indication that the film director has FAILED MISERABLY.So many missed opportunities for a good horror film that were totally abandoned. And don't give me this garbage that the movie was supposed to be some sort of metaphor for a failed relationship. That just insults the intelligence of everyone who makes the unfortunate mistake of viewing this film. This movie was a waste of time, money, and my intellect. I would have rather stayed home and played with my dog, or cleaned my bathroom, or bashed my head against the wall. Really anything else besides see this movie.",1,210,391,3 July 2019
12 Years a Slave," Great movie, a few factual issues
","This is an incredibly filmed movie, with stunning cinematography, superb acting, and a story so engaging it will heighten every emotion within the viewer. I highly recommend it. My issues with the film are mainly its dissection of source material. The move movie is based on the title character's memoirs. Solomon is depicted, in the first scene of the movie, as being sexually provoked/molested-whatever-by another slave. This character was a strong Christian, and my issue is less about his response in the film than the actual scene. Why start a film off with sex between non-consenting adults, when such a scenario is never discussed in the book. Totally outside the source material, and obviously a director's choice. But it diminishes the religiosity of the character in my opinion. Also, Brad Pitt's character is portrayed as far too much of a Jesus-figure than in the memoir. His detached ambience is appealing on the screen, but no true to what the book records. All in all, fabulous film. A few minor issues.",7,0,1,20 August 2018
There Will Be Blood," Odd music and even more odd film
","Acting was great, cinematography was beautiful. But story was extremely lacking. Other than the corrupt preacher, we have have no backstory to any character and this have no explanation of any motivations. The tone of the movie was very odd to me-in particular regarding the music. Without the score by Johnny Greenwood, the movie could easily pass as a typical drama. The only reason any part of the movie seemed 'scary' was due to the music. It solely gave an ominous feel, not the story.",7,1,2,27 July 2018
Incredibles 2," Should I care about the social justice nonsense?
","I'll start by saying I don't like movie reviews that can't speak to the substance of the art while perhaps disagreeing with the message. That being said, there is definite social justice garbage being pedaled in this movie (female empowerment over men who are all a bunch of idiots, gender role switches, 'illegal' social classes, etc.), and those are a part of why I was bored with the movie. But the main reason I that I felt like this movie went nowhere. All of the subplots never played out (Helen upstaging her husband, the villain's absurd and elaborate motivation). The only funny moments involved the baby. The worst part was that the movie was just too long. Not as good as the original, but not a terrible movie. Pixar has done far better sequels.",6,1,5,23 June 2018
The Cabin in the Woods," Decent horror film, ultimately not gratifying
","Finally, a horror movie with a fresh plot! And in the days of torture porn masquerading as feature films, Cabin in the Woods definitely delivers in the category of originality. The problem, however, is what to do with the end of the story. My 6th grade English teacher used to tell me 'that's what separates the men from the boys, the real writers from the mediocre ones.' That is, what to to with the end of the story.The problem that I have with the film is inherent in Joss Wheedon's purpose--that is, to create a stand-alone horror flick that is unlike anything that came before it, or will come after it. Fine, mission accomplished. But one can put a chair in an art gallery and call it art. And perhaps some might find it amusing, interesting, entertaining---but ultimately, it doesn't gratify.The premise is interesting--but given away a bit too early, in my opinion. 5 teenagers (?) spend a weekend in a cabin in the woods, zombies attack, people have sex and die, da da da da da.....But the twist is that it's all in the control of technicians who seem to care little for the participants, who are watching the teens' every move, and helping to ensure their demises. Why, we all ask? Well, that's the biggest problem with the film.Even if the movie had been left completely open-ended, with no further explanation past 'trying to keep the people upstairs happy,' the movie would have been better. But that would have left room for a sequel, which Wheedon certainly doesn't want. Or perhaps it could have ended with a twisted government experiment, but that would have seemed like too much of a social statement. I think Joss Wheedon's character in the movie said it best: 'Do you remember the days when all you had to do was throw a woman into a volcano?' From this, I gather, the movie is ultimately an homage to the past horror films of our lives, and I thank you, dear sir. But ultimately, the ending just doesn't cut it, and it certainly doesn't live up to the expectations of the rest of the film. And just one quick question: What the #%&* was Sigourney Weaver doing in this movie?",4,2,6,21 September 2012
