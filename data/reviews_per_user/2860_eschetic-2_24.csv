Angels & Demons," Ah, the irony! Better film, lesser returns.
","Millions of us who enjoyed the finely crafted fiction of Dan Brown'a DaVinci Code novel were sorely disappointed in the highly anticipated and inevitably successful Ron Howard movie of same. Tom Hanks didn't fit our mental image of the suave central character, Robert Langdon and like many modern action movies based on decent novels, it short-formed or omitted too many of the best loved plot details.Ironical, Brown's less well crafted earlier novel Angels & Demons came to the screen as a far more satisfying film and fled to DVD far faster. Let's face it, worse novels frequently make better films, both because they may rely more on visuals and action than mental development and because there are fewer invidious comparisons to make. Hanks as an EARLIER Robert Langdon (several remarks in the film make the time frame of the story which was supposed to take place BEFORE the DaVinci Code ambiguous at least - and those who know both books will try to ignore these or face the disappointment of the negation of the relationship with Sophie) is fitter and more like the Langdon of the novels - he has to be in this far more active role. The less complex plot for Angels... has fewer 'codes' to be missed, and the one major plot revision between page and screen actually makes more sense than Brown's original even though it allows a supporting character (the perfectly cast Ewen McGregor as the Camerlengo) to 'take stage' from Langdon (it had to do with the well filmed helicopter climax).Like The DaVinci Code and all those earlier James Bond thriller/travelogues, Angels & Demons takes us to exotic places (here in and around Rome and Vatican City) and while the set designers actually recreated a majority of them for filming, they did their job beautifully and even those of us who have been there can enjoy ravishing revisits to favorite places along with the action.Of course there are the inevitable plot holes which the flesh and action films are heir to (in all probability no mortal man could cover the ground specified in the time allowed and the effect of the specified bomb is basically incalculable and fudged for effect in the film), but Director Howard and plotter Brown keep us too visually and mentally occupied to care.For anyone who likes action films intelligent enough to allow thought on a higher plane than the Disney/Bruckheimer misfire, G Force, Angels & Demons is highly recommended.",8,0,1,18 December 2009
Black Swan," How do you destroy a ballet thriller? Start by hiring Darren Aronofsky, continue by casting non-dancers.
","We fought our way through the season's first serious snow storm in New York to see BLACK SWAN, much praised (in some quarters) for reasons which I can only conclude have something to do with the silent movie style reliance on close-ups - one gathers a Darren Aronofsky trademark - to disguise the fact that this 'ballet' film has almost no actual dancing except in the background because the leads *can't* - getting there and home again was the fun part. For anyone with any actual frame of reference either in the ballet or modern film, the movie was simply dreadful.A conflation of the *worst* parts of THE RED SHOES performed without actual dancers (three minutes of details of ballerinas working on their toe shoes do NOT equal 30 seconds of actual DANCE) and a very bloated 'Twilight Zone' episode, I would ONLY recommend this film to parents who would prefer to drive their children to therapy rather than have them take up ballet, or to hard up straight men and lesbians who want to see 'respectable' pornography (it is R rated for extended segments here no respectable gay man should be forced to watch as well as 'violent content, language and some drug use'). Seriously: years ago I found 'Deep Throat' and 'Behind The Green Door' *significantly* less offensive.The basic story of the artist so totally wrapped up in her role she loses herself with tragic consequences is perfectly valid - Carlos Saura did it with a flamenco CARMEN in a 1983 Spanish film brilliantly and even Isaac Asimov used the idea of the curse of a 'perfect' performance as the basis of one of his more memorable short stories. With competent writing and direction, it could make a *thrilling* film or even stage musical, but under Aronofsky's close up direction, the screenplay by three separate hands raises all sorts of potential issues without resolving ANY of them. Is the choreographer a monster trying to seduce the virginal Portman or merely trying to get a performance out of her? Is Portman being drugged by an ambitious rival in the corps de ballet or perhaps her own jealous mother or is she merely having a mental breakdown under the pressure of her big break and the artist's quest for 'perfection'? WE'LL never know, and once he's convinced the shallow that he's 'serious' by raising the issues, Aronofsky doesn't seem to care - competent suspense, surrealism and even Grand Guignol macabre are not merely the incomprehensibility and bad behavior drained of the inherent beauty of his subject that Aronofsky gives us.Even beyond the core plot indignities Miss Portman's character is forced to endure, apparently unprofessional behavior which would never be allowed to pass at Lincoln Center (where the film is set) is consistently given a pass - or is it part of the actress' delusion or the director's conceit? The choice *as presented* in this movie is not sophisticated or even surrealistic, it is simply lazy film making - writing, direction and acting. Worst of all, the film is dishonest even to its own story telling. Portman's flirting with 'perfection' in her official performance is early destroyed in her first act on stage and the supposed perfection of her act two 'Black Swan' is rendered physically impossible by the director's final (and ludicrously drawn out) 'coup de theatre.' That is simply bad movie making.Even the MUSICAL direction is poor, frittering away the great Tchaikovsky themes in Clint Mansell's lame adaptation which rarely was allowed to soar except in the movie title segment of the actual performance of SWAN LAKE (leads only shown from the chest up) to help give the impression Ms. Portman's acting is supposed to, and scared far less than even middling work in an average Hitchcock film. (Hitchcock could have made a corker of a thriller out of this mishmash - just add the detail that the director had poisoned the lipstick the girl steals.) Anyone who thinks this is 'outstanding' really does need to check out an even middling ballet film like THE TURNING POINT (of *course* it was melodrama, but hot without resorting to pornography, the dancing was REAL and you could care about the characters!).If you don't think the present producers are fully aware of the quality of their work, look at the ads in Sunday's papers (26 December 2010) touting the movie as 'WINNER' of 19 separate 'Critics' Choice,' Golden Globe' and 'Screen Actors' Guild' Awards - but in dishonest, almost disappearing print *half* the size of the word 'winner' is the word 'nominations'. They haven't won a single award yet - and if god respects the arts, they never will. (Since this was written, Ms. Portman has been given an award or two for her 'acting' which can only be a devastating comment on her competition and 'the voters.' For those who understand that acting is more than just appearing angst ridden, this is mere scenery chewing.)I *will* say that the theatre was nearly full (to my surprise given the snow storm already in full progress), and afterward I heard as many people bubbling 'how great' it was as grumbling that it was the 'worst piece of crap' they had ever seen. At $13 a ticket for the early show some people have to defend the expenditure even to themselves. When out on DVD, the film's failings as a surreal thriller will doubtless be more tolerable reduced to the small screen, and no serious artistic values will be lost. I'd probably raise my rating to an overly generous 4 as a failed attempt at ballet based Grand Guignol, but it's still a basically bad movie that would be relegated to the 'midnight' trash circuit if it didn't have a major studio behind it.",2,26,58,26 December 2010
Source Code," Sci-fi Lite, but a satisfying, intelligent date flick
","In a film so fast paced that most audiences wouldn't notice any plot holes until well after the lights come up, the Asimovian/Heinleinian underpinnings are so well written that even after a couple hours discussion most will feel that a majority of the obvious incongruities are satisfyingly tied up - and given the general appealing nature of the characters and story, you will want to talk about the film over long drinks or desert afterward if this is taken as the intelligent date movie it should be.One of the nicest things about SOURCE CODE is that *part* of the quality in the writing is knowingly letting the audience guess what's going on a scene or two ahead of the characters. We went in not even knowing the core concept, just that there were sci-fi overtones and that the lead was the always enjoyable Jake Gyllenhaal - it could just as well have been Matt Damon or any of the other current young action heroes - and were immediately swept up in the well explained action. All very satisfying, but, as I said at the start, also ultimately light. Because it is at its heart a sci-fi mystery, once the mystery is solved it doesn't seem as weighty philosophically or as demanding of re-viewing as, say, a GROUNDHOG'S DAY, but it is just as much undeniable fun at the time.Despite my last sentence, this is a film I'm going to want on DVD when it comes out. The CGI effects - both exploding trains and the in-lab environment(s) for Gyllenhaal - are beautifully executed and the real time cinematography is a delight to watch. Is Chicago re-imagined as it might look in a decade or two or shown as it is? From these crispy clean overhead and suburban angles it is hard to tell for this non-native. If the setting is, as I suspect, in the near future, it is delightful to have an essentially optimistic take on the future for a change.Just HOW optimistic will depend in part on how the audience interprets the final scene - which is one more admirable aspect of the generally salubrious writing. Note that the final text message sent and received (is it to this reality or an alternate? Your choice) is 'Help him', not a request to 'give him what he wants' *now*. Again, what is meant or how it will be interpreted is left to the audience - and offers as many possible interpretations as there may be dimensions the audience is willing to posit.This will almost certainly be long forgotten by the nominators when the year-end honors are being proposed, but it is still the most satisfying non-epic science fiction film I have seen in a very long time. If you like light sci-fi or tech-mysteries, this is close to a don't miss and a great potential date movie if your date is intelligent enough. Think INCEPTION-lite. I suspect that in 50 years SOURCE CODE will play as well as the 20th Century Fox Charlie Chan or Mr. Moto films do today - even though no one is going to build a series around it.",8,0,1,17 May 2011
Skyfall," Thoroughily enjoyable Bond outing only a little let down by Mendes' direction
","Daniel Craig and Ian Flemming's great James Bond character are always worth spending time with - both for the adventure of seeing where this 50 year old franchise can go next and the joy of seeing subtle acting in a very unsubtle genre. One notices however, after enjoying a couple hours of solid escapist adventure including both touching transitions (a great character exiting the series given a meaty role on the way out!) and smile inducing re-introductions of minor iconic characters (it's clear THIS Moneypenny is going to have more to do in future films even if the classic Aston Martin may not!), that by the next day between the standard set pieces (the thrilling chases, the smooth erotic encounters and the lavishly filmed travelogues) there seems to be a certain lack in the connective tissue holding director Sam Mendes' story telling together.Yes, we do have a new villain who has freshly creepy kinks to offer, and a few jokes all too parsimoniously doled out, but neither the kink nor the comedy get enough screen time (or have the impact to FEEL like they have enough screen time) to fully satisfy! The great first challenging encounter between Craig and Bardem seems particularly shortchanged (even though it contains the movie's most memorable line, 'what makes you think it's my first time?'), and the 'Hannibal Lecter' style transitional confinement scene is simply a time waster, but any film which can have the fun this one does with a pair of komodo dragons and a throw-away line about 'the circle of life' is not so very far off the track with which the series has always bonded with its audience, and there are other delightful surprises as well (I defy anyone to *recognize* Albert Finney in his sublime turn at the family estate which gives the film its title).This is a smooth enjoyable Bond from the superlative opening credits (among the best in the series so far) to the final rooftop passing of the 'inheritance', neither shaken nor stirring, but a worthy addition to the series and pointing the way to potential greatness still to come. 'Rebooting' an adventure series which had gotten the not entirely deserved reputation of being a Cold War creation (only FROM Russia WITH LOVE really went there) into a Post-Cold War environment where the nature of the threats have evolved is not a bad thing - even when copycats from Helm to Bourne to all the earlier Bond incarnations makes keeping ideas and visuals fresh difficult. Ben Whishaw's new 'Q' offers impressive potential if we can take his unfortunate assertion that 'we don't go in for that sort of thing any more' as mere hyperbole and something the DEPARTMENT will back off of when they see the potential for the sort of 'toys' his kind are good at - particularly if interacting with the fascinatingly flawed Naomie Harris' character, Eve, and while the initial introduction of Ralph Fiennes here was none too smooth until the exciting scene in the Committee Hearing Room, there is great potential to be mined in his persona as well.It is easy to note that Sam Mendes is a wildly uneven director in his stage work - sometimes brilliant, sometimes simply misguided - and he shows the full range of that unevenness in this film. Two of the important new 'Bond women,' Bérénice Marlohe as a supposedly frightened adversary and Helen McCrory as an aggressive MP are essentially wasted in his apparent effort not to be 'politically incorrect' (to do a Bond film is to free yourself from such concerns unless you can honor them with *humor*). Nevertheless, he gets the broad sweep of the film right and if he returns for another go in the series, one can expect the ride will be smoother and the 'highs' of comfort, kink and comedy even higher. I look forward to it - or ANY film in which Daniel Craig or Dame Judi Dench hold forth.",8,4,11,19 November 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A surprisingly satisfying 'alternate history' adventure
","I read the book almost on a dare, but was surprised to find that the author had put in almost as much solid research as Doris Kearns Goodwin, the author of the definitive Lincoln work 'Team of Rivals,' to make his background solid. The film mostly lives up to the book and with or without the trashy/fun overlay of the supernatural admirably depicts the LOOK and feel of America in the mid-19th Century.While some admirable elements (like the frame) of the book are passed over, with the exception of the few White House scenes where only one Lincoln child is mentioned, the Cabinet is ignored and Lincoln's actual two white secretaries, Nicolay and Hay, are conflated into one black friend of the President's, most of the actual historical figures are more than fairly painted even as the film starts to drift from the tight structure of the book toward the end.Over all the film is a fun 'alternate history' which ironically does bring the actual issue of slavery back into an examination of the Civil War. We came away (and the friend who went with me had not read the book) having found the film exceptionally well cast, acted and directed and immensely satisfying. Most satisfying of all, the more solid knowledge of history you HAVE, the more you'll enjoy the film, although it plays well merely as adventure. Benjamin Walker's Lincoln - he made a notable mark on Broadway last season playing a 'Bloody, Bloody (President) Andrew Jackson' - is particularly good, blending a credible young Lincoln with the more ingrained popular image from the penny. If the film has a fault, it is over produced in places (the burning bridge scene) - but to criticize it for that would be like damning GONE WITH THE WIND for the 'burning of Atlanta' scene going on too long! Mark it as something better than a guilty pleasure. Too many of the print critics heard the concept and assumed it had to be a campy spoof like Roman Polanski's THE FEARLESS VAMPIRE SLAYERS or PLEASE TAKE YOUR FANGS OUT OF MY NECK - and seemed upset that it wasn't. Go for what it IS, and you'll have a very good time.",7,2,6,1 July 2012
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Big, pretty fun. A music-free WIZARD OF OZ for the 21st Century
","PRINCE OF PERSIA; forget the well publicized video-game inspiration (only in the afterglow does the final romantic resolution feel like the artificial balance of a successfully played 'video-game' - it's also romantically right); I'd never heard of the video games and was far more aware of the semi-literate time travel, royal conspiracy and fairy tale sources those games were apparently cribbed from. While the final literal flashback just barely passes the credibility test under the 'world rules' the film makers have set up, the plot basically works as a framework to hang the ample action and beautifully crafted fantasy on.OK, I'm a sucker for Jake Gyllenhaal's smile (if you aren't, you probably shouldn't go - it's used a lot) but the film also has Sir Ben Kingsley and a uniformly talented supporting cast (Gyllenhaal's chemistry with leading lady Gemma Arterton is on a par with Tracy & Hepburn and based on the same kind of sparing), surprisingly decent production values and, as stated, a plot pretty well plagiarized from several relatively literate sources and recent front page searches for non-existent 'weapons of mass destruction.' If 'G FORCE' - that ghastly gopher-spies-meet-evil-household-appliance-transformers kiddie film - was just what you'd expect from a Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration, this was probably as good as the unlikely ill-matched species mating could produce.I'm a passionate believer in historical accuracy in theatrical story telling BASED on history (we LEARN much of our history from popular entertainment), but when your sources are as close to Andrew Lang's classic books of Fairy Tales as to Gibbon's or even McCullough's historical literature, the impossibility of placing this Persian 'prince' or any details of his story in any actual chronology or even 'real' historical legends can easily be excused.PRINCE OF PERSIA is big, pretty and satisfying for at least as long afterward as it took to see it. It probably doesn't try to be more than fun, but it certainly succeeds at that. Is it worth the prices they're charging for movie-house films today? At least you see where the money went. I think I'll want to see it again - probably more than once - when the DVD comes out.",8,1,3,6 June 2010
Ted," A question of taste
","It boils down to a question of taste. This film takes a well worn but clever idea (a child's Teddy Bear is given the gift of cognition and speech in response to a wish) and instead of going in the predictable, maudlin direction of the child inevitably outgrowing the toy (as in I.Q.), it goes in a different direction. The child (Mark Wahlberg) never out grows the toy and the toy never outgrows the child, but both age into foul mouthed 'everyman' working class jerks (with, inexplicably, the toy having better luck (but worse taste) with ladies and drug suppliers than the boy - one wonders where the boy got passably adult standards (and Mila Kunis) even to this extent - possibly by watching episodes of MacFarlane's FAMILY GUY which is much more consistent and disciplined in its humor, possibly because it's on network TV.The problem isn't the language. When the shock value plays satirically against expectations (as in the definitive answer to IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE as a Christmas movie, THE REF) it can be bracing and fresh. Here though, it is not only all pervasive but as inconsistent as the story telling (adults and Ted swear right up to the point where a swearing father says 'you shouldn't swear in front of children.' Ted, the toy, is treated as a real person by EVERYONE but the possibility of selling him to a psychotic father - Giovanni Ribisi in a change of pace role - of a horrible child who wants him is treated as reasonable. The stuffed bear is shown taking a bubble bath with no realistic issues of absorption or drying out). EFFECTIVE fantasy must be grounded in some reality or at least consistency. The only consistent thing here is the overly broad Boston accents (Southey might consider defamation suits.) If gross-out comedies where prostitutes dedicating on your girlfriend's floor on a dare and your girlfriend's reaction thereto is considered ripe material for comedy in your world, add another couple stars to my rating - if not, deduct two stars.You will still want to go along for this particular ride so badly because the acting (Whalberg and various unbilled supporting character actors - one nice cameo with Patrick Warburton and Ryan Reynolds offsets a lot of implied homophobia - and even Seth MacFarlane's voice for the well CGI'd Ted) is so good and the idea has such potential, but if you make it as far as the cameo of Sam Jones (from the campy FLASH GORDON remake) without being as high as the lead characters, or switching to the essentially more innocent (and funnier) HAROLD & KUMAR films, you may want to consider counseling.You're definitely not going to feel comfortable watching TED with pre-teens around (one of the reasons it tanked in the theatres) and I have to wonder who else the film makers had in mind when they green lighted it. Who else would laugh at the idea of Lance Armstrong's testicle (lost to cancer) being bronzed and displayed by a collector - not to mention followed by the obvious line from period Mounds/Almond Joy commercials.The traditional fight scene between the best buddies (and the whipping of Whalberg's half naked ass by said best buddy) is a moment or three I will long remember, but all in all I cannot honestly recommend the film as a whole. Whalberg in song (not too long after the fight scene) will probably recall Cameron Diaz's challenged vocalizing in MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING for many, but without the warm romantic pay-off. Nothing in TED has that kind of pay-off, and that's the real problem.",4,8,15,30 September 2012
Don Jon," Solid, hard to define indie satire which will make some very uncomfortable - EXCELLENT first directorial effort!
","Defining what kind of film this is had to be the hardest part of getting DON JON made, but ultimately it was worth it! It isn't really a 'guy' film even though *technically* it tries to look at sex from a guy's perspective. It may actually best be called a 'chick' flick, but one they would see alone rather than with a date. At the screening I saw, ALL the raucous laughter was coming from very obviously female voices - falling out of their chairs laughing over what they viewed as stereotypical male behavior - and even as the supposed '10' played by Scarlett Johansson reveals herself to be the kind of demanding (insert the word for a female canine here) who a very stupid - make that excessively immature - straight boy (like the one played with supreme élan by author/director Gordon-Levitt) would make a fool of himself over! The film heavily satirizes stereotypical straight New Jersey Catholics - the easily offended of which should probably stay away along with anyone who expects a slick date night romantic comedy that doesn't require them to THINK - but it IS a beautifully structured and polished first directorial effort and very funny in its way. Man or woman though, it is not your usual DATE film to see with the opposite sex. The litmus scene for the film was probably when Johansson (Barbara) confronts Gordon-Levitt (Jon) over watching porn! Foolishly trying to evoke simple reason, he (accurately) tells her that 'EVERY guy watches porn - and that anyone who says he doesn't is lying.' The theatre got absolutely quiet there for a moment in any section where dates were sitting, as each side wondered what the other was thinking. What YOU may think in that scene will determine a lot about how you view and react to the film. You may enjoy it regardless of what you think of that (for the film) core issue, but you sure won't want to see it with anyone who you can't comfortably talk about it with.The 'home' scenes with Jon's family and Barbara's are probably excess baggage, but they give the central characters broad context (the broadest performance in a very stylized film is probably Tony Danza's performance as Jon's father) - and set up the one totally human moment in the film when Jon's silent sister defines what a good sibling should be when she finally has a line! Ultimately, there is one unexpected, rational woman (Julianne Moore giving a remarkable imitation of Susan Sarandon!) who Jon meets in the night class Barbara insists he take who not only 'gets' him but broadens his horizons for the kind of growth any central character in a good film must have.Don't expect a pat happy ending or a cheap thought-free throw away comedy (and DON'T make it first date material with someone you don't know yet!), and the open minded will have a wonderful time. My take-away image is really of a few years ago at the first Broadway preview of a Tony winning musical called AVENUE Q. Just before it started, a student of mine at the university where I teach came over to introduce his mother who was seeing the show too, sitting in front of each other all the way over at the side. Midway through the show there was a very funny, very outrageous musical number called 'You Can Be As Loud As You Want' (When You're making Love). I glanced over to see how my student and his mother were taking it and, as you can imagine, my student, sitting in front of his mother, was sinking onto the floor with embarrassment. What he *couldn't see* was his mother rocking with laughter both at the insouciance of the number and her son's embarrassment! I think my mother (who, as far as I know, probably doesn't approve of pornography) or my minister would be howling with laughter at DON JON too - but they probably wouldn't want anyone they knew to see them doing so.Recommended - but with noted reservations.",7,115,150,6 October 2013
The Prestige," A thinking man's director - a satisfying film - hard to classify
","THE PRESTIGE is a fascinating, satisfying if flawed look at magicians and passion through the lens of a thinking man's director using details of turn of the century history as his palate. Most satisfying if you're up to following the unexpected details, but it must have been frustrating for the releasing studio to try and figure our how to SELL the film when it first came out.Is it a simple classic costume mystery? (It isn't) Do you give away that there may be science fiction elements? (They didn't - to even hint that there may have been some inspiration in the STAR TREK series and its fictional technology might have been a major spoiler, but without buying into that concept, the film has a serious logistic flaw - and the mere incorporation of references to the period science - heavily extrapolated - of Nicholas Tesla wasn't enough to get the point across for many) Are the great Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale big enough stars to simply sell it as a vehicle? (At that point they weren't) The film didn't find its initial audience and went to DVD all too soon, but it's rightly developing a fair cult now, because it IS a fascinating experience for audiences knowledgeable enough to bring at least some awareness of Nicholas Tesla (the Sci-Si Channel's great series EUREKA has helped a lot on this front), willing to actually pay attention to Nolan's complex story telling which uses the flash-back and flash-forward more effectively than most recent films, willing to take a leap of faith or two and anxious to enjoy the excellent work from a uniformly superb cast and director.It is all too tempting to see the first shadings of director Nolan's lighter but more complex 'thinking man's extravaganza,' INCEPTION, in THE PRESTIGE. Both are films which require an audience willing to pay full attention and actually LISTEN, not just lie back and wait for the car crashes and exploding buildings to entertain them. Both are stories which use the pain of lost love to unexpected advantage motivating their core characters. Both are immensely rewarding to those willing to THINK and not just absorb.In the film and real life 'the prestige' is a magician's term for the final reveal which makes a trick pay off. On DVD, THE PRESTIGE is a prestige item serious film buffs will want to savor more than once.",7,1,1,18 July 2010
Closer," An admirable stage to screen transfer which demands intelligent attention
","I first saw the outstanding Patrick Marber play, CLOSER, when it was on Broadway (172perf., March 25-Aug. 22, 1999, at the Music Box Theatre with the late Natasha Richardson in the Julia Roberts role following a successful run in London, where the play is set) and was enthralled with the cool cinematic dissection of the come-again-go-again relationship of four people. I liked the play so much that I somehow never got to the excellent film version with a well neigh perfect cast until recently on DVD.Coming back to the piece a decade later, in a version which director Mike Nichols, working from the playwright's own screenplay, somewhat Bowdlerized (he eliminated the death of one character who now merely goes abroad and actually improved the opening of the Second Act in the Strip Club by reducing the 'ick factor') in the vain hope of warming the piece for a broader audience, I am struck again with what a superb, un-sappy, universal examination it is of the motivations and mistakes which plague and bless interpersonal relationships. Many people will find this unromantic and cynical, but only if they are unprepared to accept how close the characters come to themselves or people they know in spirit if not in detail. People who thought the Prince/Sondheim/Furth musical COMPANY was somehow an attack on marriage rather than a statement of how essential 'coupling' is to the human condition will simply not 'get' this film.Structurally, Marber still gives us a brilliant flow jumping back and forth in time and occasionally playing mirroring scenes overlapping each other. Under the earlier playwright's heavy influence, this is probably the best play Harold Pinter never wrote - improving on the master in Marber's clarity of vision and gift for real dialogue. All too often when a stage production glories in a 'cinematic' approach, it is screwed up when it comes to the screen by a director who feels he must impose his own concept on the piece. CLOSER was blessed with the choice of Mike Nichols - a director who was sufficiently self assured not to have to worry about calling attention to himself, but merely serving the best in Marber's story.The performances Nichols gets - from Julia Roberts as Anna the artist (unfairly criticized in some circles for precisely the emotionally inhibited quality which makes it real), Jude Law as Dan the striving author / obituary editor, Natalie Portman* (in the only fully professional performance I have ever seen from her - the director really does make a difference; witness her cheap scenery chewing in BLACK SWAN this year regardless of award nominations it may bring her) as Alice the damaged free spirit and the darkly sensuous and painfully insecure Clive Owen* as Larry the sex addict who finally finds a love he needs - are all as close to perfection as any audience could ask. (* = well deserved Oscar Nominations and Golden Globe AWARDS in 'Support')Although all of those involved have had bigger commercial hits, seldom have any of them done better actual work. CLOSER is not a film for the shallow or those who want fast, easy laughs or pat romantic solutions, but for an adult audience willing to engage their minds and pay attention, it's one of the great ones.",9,2,3,4 January 2011
Tangled," Even this late, the first genuine adult laugh-out-loud film of the year!
","A few years ago the technical wizardry of SHREK trumped the superior story telling of MONSTERS, INC. at the Oscars, and this may be one of those years. Early buzz has the wistful mixed bag TOY STORY 3 with a lock with Oscar voters who long for their lost childhood despite the monstrous children they show in that film, but the FAR more enjoyable experience, while still not without flaws of pacing, is Disney's deliriously enjoyable semi-musical (wonderful even if surprisingly unobtrusive score by Alan Menken) rethinking of the old Rapunzel legend, TANGLED.The funny and yes, actually sexy animated leading man and his innocent but capable leading lady anchor a near perfect animated cast. The cavalry horse Maximus who starts as the hero's chief nemesis and winds up his best ally is a brilliant comic creation nearly matched by Rapunzel's faux 'mother,' a 21st century version of the classic wicked witch. While some of the most popular recent animated features have generated major and minor sequels, this is the first animated film in my experience where I'd love to see these animated characters AS DRAWN and VOICED reused in other, not necessarily related properties as if they were real actors. They're so much fun to spend time with, you want to spend more. If Disney had the good sense to try an animated version of George Bernard Shaw's perennial success ARMS AND THE MAN with the same animated cast they've already developed, I'd be willing to bet it would be just as big a hit.Great cast, but also a great story told with amazing freshness and insouciance. By elaborating on the well known story of the maid in the tower to create a classic quest to center their refurbished story around, the film makers also opened the door to a dazzling array of fresh comic touches (I'm with Flynn - 'I gotta get me one of these!' - in loving the possibilities of the rediscovered old kitchen and comic standby, the cast iron skillet) and amusingly twisted sub-characters (yes, even one momentarily covered with the comic rodents that have been a Disney good luck talisman for years) with 'dreams' similar to but different from Rapunzel's and thus touched on something universal in all of us. We all have dreams that seem unrealistic, but with determination and faith may not be. TANGLED has its heart firmly in the right place as pure entertainment so that it's only afterward that we realize how strongly it was encouraging us in the audience to follow our own dreams, but the joy and the beauty that washes over us while watching it remains with us to inspire long after the credits (which, sad to relate, are the one unimaginatively filmed part of the movie and easily missed) roll.Of course the more and more ubiquitous new 3D system works beautifully and makes the motion picture experience more than it will inevitably be on the small screen, but the story telling is so good, that when the DVD inevitably comes out, it is one which will have to be on my shelves for regular reviewing whether or not we have 3D technology on our home screens yet.When the 'previews' are as good as TANGLED's, you usually think they must have pulled ALL the best parts, but this is one case where a film lives up to it's hype. It really is one of the few 'must sees' of a pretty good year at the movies. (Sadly, as of January 25, 2011, it appears my prognostication re. TOY STORY 3 was prescient: the Academy chose to only nominate THREE animated films - including the inferior 'How To Train Your Dragon' as 'Best...' - in the apparent fear that TANGLED might actually beat TOY STORY 3 as it has at the box office.

Call Me by Your Name," A remarkable revelatory 'coming of age' story - not for the overly shallow
","While I can almost guarantee that CALL ME BY YOUR NAME will *not* win this year's Oscar as Best Picture (despite the well earned nomination), by my lights it is head and shoulders the most deserving of this year's nominees. Proceeding at a stately pace to best appreciate the subtlety of the story and beauty of the settings, this is not a film for the overly shallow or those unable to appreciate adult films in the Merchant/Ivory tradition, but for those emotionally prepared to meet it on its own terms there will not be a more satisfying revelatory exploration of a male coming of age and first love this year. The films greatest achievement may be that while, as many 'first love' stories, it can be painful, it is grown up enough that (unlike a film that attempted to treat this territory a decade or to ago and forced to pander to the bigot audience that didn't realize its own bigotry) no one has to die. The 'object of desire' is a wise, highly moral graduate assistant who (contrary to the few IMDb reviewers sniffling that the film ignores the potential ethical or moral problems of the seven year age difference of the protagonists) spends a considerable part of the film avoiding the deeper relationship his academic sponsor's eldest - and almost adult - child so obviously desires in large part for that very reason. This implied danger actually gives the film an impressive edge of tension. Setting the film in Europe is probably the film's (and book's) master stroke, freeing the parties from the stultifying 50's repression of too much of what is remembered by those of us who lived through it in the U.S. - the surface cultural homogenization that the current Administration in Washington imagines as a 'happy time' to be returned to and which explains the melancholy coda to the film when the older student does have to return to it. Yes, the father's knowing, loving discussion with his son late in the film (which perfectly captures the relationships the luckiest among us HAD with our parents) is a high point that should be required viewing for every American or anyone who expects to be a parent - but the set up for that discussion is what makes CALL ME BY YOUR NAME a masterpiece of American cinema.",9,2,5,5 February 2018
Lincoln," The moving trick of making an icon human
","For over 50 years, Raymond Massey (ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS - 1940) has been the public image of the ideal and idealized Lincoln, but whatever the year end awards may think of Daniel Day Lewis' performance in Stephen Spielberg's LINCOLN, I think this may be the standard for the next fifty years: not of an idealized Lincoln, but a warmly believable, *human* Lincoln achieving his final and perhaps greatest political feat in the final months of his life.We are not given a perfect film to showcase Lewis' magnificent performance; to be honest, Spielberg has not found a satisfying emotional opening (an unconvincing close up of hand to hand combat) OR finish to his film following his triumph in the House Chamber and White House and the well finessed finale to Lincoln's life that we all know (and finding a fresh way to tell that tale, with young Tad in the seat at Grover's Theatre that his parents might have occupied, is in itself a minor achievement), David Strathairn's solid Secretary of State Seward is never allowed to show the warm literate relationship which made these two former rivals for the Republican nomination for President the envy of their Cabinet colleagues and Tad, the President's youngest son, is played with more an eye to the loving parent's image than the physically challenged (a cleft palate and lisp) historical reality, but the performances of the entire cast - Sally Field's magnificently layered Mary Todd Lincoln ('Molly') and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Robert Lincoln in an impassioned scene with his father outside the army surgery especially - more than make up for any failure of detail.VISUALLY, the detail is astounding, from the look of a still unpaved Washington and pre-electrified White House to Secretary of War Stanton's whiskers, the viewer is drawn into the historical reality of the last chapter or three of Doris Kearns Goodwin's magnificent 'Team of Rivals' (the whole book follows Lincoln from the beginning of his drive for national office), and delineates Lincoln's drive to get the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, formally and finally abolishing slavery in the United States, passed on to the States shortly after his re-election and before the new Congress could be seated in the spring. It explains even more clearly than Kearns Goodwin had why the timing of the passage was so important to Lincoln and the country. Warner Brothers' 1972 transfer of the Broadway musical 1776, like the stage version before it, showed that with the proper skill and passion, it is possible to build great suspense around a historical political event the audience consciously KNOWS to have happened but may not know the drama which surrounded it originally - so it might be easy to slough off the second time the feat is achieved, but the achievement is far from easy and the result here is in many ways even more impressive than in the musical because there are no side issues to distract the debate over...well, less potent side issues. There, the issue was independence and the side issue was slavery. Here, the issue is slavery - as Ben Franklin had prophesied, a question for a later generation - and the side issue a broader equality - a question which WE know would take more than a hundred additional years to address.The film's requisite set pieces bridging the main body of the film and the end - the burning of Richmond and Lee's surrender - are somewhat perfunctory, but ultimately satisfying. It's a fair mark of how well the film held its audience when a dozen of the full house when I saw it stayed for the full 'crawl' of the credits at the end.Over all, the film will leave you feeling a new respect and almost affectionate connection with our 16th President - one entirely appropriate at a time when we have just re-elected a president who so much of the country (admittedly in a FAR less divisive peacetime) has developed almost as warm, personal feelings about. It's fascinating to see Lincoln trying to hold his Republican Party together as the Radicals of HIS day (who were extreme LIBERALS) start to overwhelm the moderates from the perspective of a 21st century where the Radical Right has started to lose control of the party in the face of a president Lincoln made possible and who is, in fact, more like a Moderate Republican than a traditional Democrat.If the film can capitalize on its own quality and the fortuitous timing, my fondest wish is that much the same team could make ANOTHER Lincoln film from earlier chapters of 'Team Of Rivals' focusing on Lincoln's drive for the presidency itself! That one should be a corker too, and a great legacy to a broader understanding and knowledge of our essential common history.",8,4,9,17 November 2012
The Adjustment Bureau," Strong, Satisfying contemplation on The Nature of God
","I splurged yesterday and went to the movies: THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU (based, as a surprising number of satisfying sci-fi films have been, on a Philip K. Dick short story). The film proved to be a delightful romantic comedy adventure companion to Arthur C. Clarke's contemplation on the nature of God, the 2001 Space Odyssey series. This one's much more down to earth and does indulge in a dizzying mid-film chase sequence which will strike some as INCEPTION-lite, but even then, what a delight to see films again where the words (from writer/director George Nolfi) actually matter - when characters talk to each other we can care what they say because it's so well said. The romantic relationship rings true without ever risking cliché or sticky sweetness and details of the action are scrupulously foreshadowed and set up as well as in the best down to earth mysteries - right down to the importance of which way you turn a door-knob when using special 'doors' engineered by 'higher powers.' Matt Damon is a successful young politician who has lost all his blood relations years before but who has developed a caring and very tight 'official family' over the intervening years, and who meets and becomes fascinated with a delightfully off-center young ballerina, Emily Blunt, on the evening of a stumble in his upward political career path. They seemed destined to be together until odd engineered barriers seem to be moving heaven and earth to keep them apart (engineered to involve the smallest possible 'footprints'). Maybe they are 'meant' to be together. Maybe they were but something changed? Is there a 'plan' for our lives? Is it immutable? The film takes these deadly serious issues and plays with them in a warm, romantic action comedy frame that actually makes them more fun to think about.If the film ultimately ends in an almost too pat 'uplifting' resolution, it's one that goes down well - and one the audience is almost certainly pulling for for the last half of the film (is it possible we're reluctant to respect the film *because* it ends the way we hope it will?). Over all, it is VERY satisfying piece that will leave you thinking about the issues it uses for days afterward - if you want to - or simply entertain you for a wonderful hundred minutes if you're not in the mood for deeper thought. Either way, you WILL be entertained, and your intelligence will not be insulted.I recommend it highly if you like Philip K. Dick's work (films of BLADE RUNNER, TOTAL RECALL, MINORITY REPORT, PAY CHECK and others started in his fertile imagination), Matt Damon's or Emily Blunt's (the female lead who dances FAR better than Natailie Portman ever managed in BLACK SWAN and has a perfectly lovely chemistry with Damon). Even the city (Manhattan), its sub- and superstructure, becomes an active character as Damon's life is turned upside down and he tries to right it. John Slattery is not only practically perfect as the mysterious, slightly slimy 'heavy,' but when revealed as essentially a mid-level functionary who doesn't necessarily know what's going on, adds a wonderful level of comically mystified humanity - if, in context, that's the proper word.THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU is ultimately probably too 'small' a film to be Academy Award fodder, but you WILL have fun. It's something of a delightful surprise in that how many romantic comedy sci-fi speculations on the nature of god actually come along? Decidedly recommended to anyone with a mind who enjoys playing with it occasionally. If you loved INCEPTION, you won't want to miss THE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU - if this one is not the great one that was, it's in the same ball park.",8,1,3,6 March 2011
Les Misérables," An overwhelming experience soars above leaden direction
","This LES MIZ was largely wonderful despite astonishingly bad direction (the deft touch this director displayed in THE KING'S SPEECH has given way to the ludicrous 'tar and feather' scene in the TV JOHN ADAMS mini-series which seems to be more his métier - relying on excessive close-ups as if it were a 1950's TV special - and he essentially destroys the 'comic' Thénardiers. Someone really must persuade Helena Bonham Carter to play another NORMAL role some time soon; she's given this performance a few too many times). The rest of the cast however, soared above the challenges their director set them. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, the released convict who stole a loaf of bread to feed his sister's child & Eddie Redmayne as Marius, the wealthy young rebel who falls in love with Valjean's ward, Cosette, walk away with everything; both are beyond marvelous, but even Russell Crowe (the intense Inspector Javert, determined to track down Valjean) is far better than you've heard. No, he can't hit some of the notes in 'Stars', but that *could* have been 'tweaked.' It's a real pity that it wasn't! This is NOT a filmed stage production but a fully realized (and in places abbreviated) film of a great stage work, so insisting on exclusively live performances even when the technology has improved to make that possible was, in this small case, foolish.Opening at the end of the year, just before the serious Oscar races kick off, it is impossible not to consider a film's prospects on that front. Everyone's talking about Anne Hathaway's doomed Fantine (with her perennial hit song, 'I Dreamed A Dream') because she's a 'name' and she IS good - VERY good in the final scene - but Samantha Barks' Eponine (with her own hit song, 'On My Own') is even better, even with a slightly truncated part! Isabelle Allen's little Cosette is the original poster child reborn, and the definitive Jean Valjean, Colm Wilkinson (robbed of awards for the top role in London and New York by a flashier performance credited with carrying another, lesser show), makes a fine appearance as the Bishop who redeems Valjean's soul! Ham handed direction aside, just about the only ACTOR who came up short for us - including Crowe - was a case of miscasting rather than lack of merit. Enjolras, leader of the student rebels (and the first Act Finale), NEEDS to be a figure of literally towering charisma - a young Hugh Jackman if you will. On stage, Aaron Tveit has charisma and intensity to spare, but standing next to Eddie Redmayne at the barricade, as he has to, he comes across as 'second in command.' Nevertheless, if you like the basic show, any such reservations are mere quibbles. With many sources talking about LES MISERABLES and Spielberg's LINCOLN being the prohibitive favorites for the Best Picture Oscar, it does give one pause that for the first time in MY memory, neither Oscar contender is particularly well directed - but at least LINCOLN's direction mainly fails at the start with the lame battle scene that tries to set the tone of a nation too long at war.The last Oscar tie I can remember was when Streisand and Hepburn pulled it off (and well merited) for their leading roles in FUNNY GIRL and THE LION IN WINTER, but I'd really love to see three this year: LINCOLN and LES MIZ for Best Picture, Jackman and Daniel Day Lewis as Best Actor and Sally Fields and Anne Hathaway as Supporting Actress. I think LINCOLN may be close to a lock on the first two, and LES MIZ for the last, but if I had to choose ONE, I'd go with Jackman (Day-Lewis is magnificent and CONSISTENT as Lincoln, but the variety and intensity in Jackman's Valjean is astounding) and Fields (an actress I don't even *like* under normal circumstances, but making Mary Todd Lincoln not only human and understandable but sympathetic is a thing only achieved once in a lifetime).I can't honestly make any observation about the new song they always feel they *have* to insert (regardless of the quality of a score) for Oscar purposes. We simply didn't notice it. If it's a good thing that it blended so well with the rest of the robust score as to pass un-noticed, it at least met that standard.The audience we saw LES MIZ with on the Opening afternoon was rather fascinating as well - in part as reflection on things the film got very right. Eddie Redmayne had set the song up so well, that more than half a dozen of us unexpectedly - *I* certainly didn't see or even feel it coming! - broke out in audible sobs half a beat *before* Hugh Jackman swung into the iconic 'Bring Him Home' (which he brings off credibly - no mean achievement) and again when he's revealing to Marius much later why he, Valjean, must go away! ...and of course, more than half the audience were wholeheartedly applauding at the end - I was amazed we weren't two or three times DURING the show. You *wanted* to, because the numbers are structured to ask for it.Nice job - maybe director Hooper didn't do such an awful job after all - but if it had been as well directed as it was written and acted, LINCOLN wouldn't be anywhere near a lock on Best Picture this year. Regardless of how the Oscar races come out however, this is a fine film that any fan of the international stage success should want to savor over repeated viewings.

In Time," Excellent idea, inevitably flawed execution. Serious disappointment,
","The idea of taking the basic idea behind the classic LOGAN'S RUN, where in order to stretch limited resources to the maximum an earlier generation had limited all life expectancy to a set maximum (around the age of the average movie-goer), and giving it a more complex and 'sophisticated' extension (some half thought out clap-trap about the potential for and downside of immortality based on the shorter lives of others is a late afterthought) was not a bad one, but positing a society where all aging stops at 25 *without* offering an explanation of how society got reorganized on these lines also presents certain problems which these film makers proved unequal to.With no 'character' actors available under the concept (the closest we are allowed is The Big Bang Theory's excellent Johnny Galecki, wasted in a small role as Timberlake's sidekick in the film's early scenes), the film has a real problem finding characters the film goer finds interesting enough to care about. Timberlake and his co-star, Ms. Seyfried, have the requisite charisma and, in Mr. Timberlake's case, a growing acting ability, but the other twenty-somethings all tend to blend into each other with only Cillian Murphy's latter-day 'Javert' and (thanks to his TV personality) Matt Bomer as a suicidal 'century holder' making much of an impression - and the film's extremely cold heart has too weak a beat to sustain interest even when it leaves its original concept and enters 'Bonnie & Clyde' territory.When you can't care about the characters and you give up on any hope of a 'happy ending' near mid-film (having failed to say how 'the system' came into being, they can't make us believe in the financial principles it would take to bring it down - let alone return the leads to a safe life) and worst of all, when the journey ceases to strike the viewer as credible, the film which pretends to concentrate on time as a metaphor for money risks leaving the audience resenting the time it's taken from IT - and at movie prices these days, that's a pretty fair parallel - long before the silly ending.What a pity. I had really been looking forward to this one.",4,0,1,10 March 2012
Jersey Boys," 'Oh, What A Night'...it might have been!
","Were the reviews really that bad? I saw the film this afternoon in Manhattan with only 7 other people in the large theatre, and while it was technically more faithful to the stage show (which remains one of the best shows on Broadway after eight and a half years!) than 1982's 'Burt & Dolly Go to a Whorehouse', it wasn't nearly as much fun. Despite at least one of the notices I scanned which thanked the film for 'basically showing us the musical at a lower price than it would have been on stage' (or words to that effect), it really doesn't - despite preserving many of the musicals touchstones like the characters 'breaking the 4th wall' to bring us into the story and following the basic - originally effective - 'blemishes and all' plot line.A good bit of the problem (beyond Mr. Eastwood's heavy handed, dark direction) was simply that film is inherently a more REALISTIC medium than the stage, and showing the events of the show in 'realistic' settings (or showing them at all!) rather than the original highly stylized indications drains them of any charm they had originally - the casting of half the leads achieves this in other ways. Yes, we're thrilled that Tony Winning lead John Lloyd Young was allowed to repeat some of his performance - but, like the rest of the group, not singing or acting NEARLY as well as he did on stage - and would that Christian Hoff (the stage Tommy DiVito who founds the singing group which evolves into The Four Seasons) also been brought along. The guy in his role (the only one of the central 'group' who had not played his role in some stage version of the show) comes off as a Ricky Nelson-with-a-sneer and impossible to like even before he alienates his peers like a musical Eric Cantor. Their screen Nick Massi is simply embarrassing. One of the genius aspects of the original show was that the stage cast actually sang BETTER than the original group. The same cannot be said of the film crew, although Eastwood appears to try to defend himself against the inevitable charges by blending in some of the group's original performances.The few noticeable liberties taken by the stage authors who are credited with writing their own screenplay are generally more problems rather than improvements. On the PLUS side, more stage time is given to the daughter Valli lost in an effort to make the loss register more (it doesn't - in part because we never SEE or even hear her supposed musical potential - unmentioned on stage), but all through the film (if one is making comparisons) it's a balancing of pluses and minuses. The group's gay record producer, Bob Crewe, once he settles into the role, like their Joe Pesci, the later film actor who as a kid introduced Bob Gaudio to the group, is a strong positive. The ever more craggy Christopher Walken as Valli's Mob connection, 'Gyp,' only manages to loosen up his stony stereotype too late in the film in time for the final confrontation with the DiVito character. The negatives ultimately out-weigh the positives - but one can't entirely tell which were the screenwriter's choices and which Eastwood's.A crucial line 'Valli' has near the end is that the most important memory for him was not all the fame or the money but that FIRST moment moment when they found 'the sound,' standing on a street corner - except that in the film, we never SEE that moment until tossed on as an afterthought LATER! We never see a moment in the entire film (until the end) where the group is performing without instruments and simply harmonizing. It's like someone forgot whose story they were telling!For ME in any case, *the* high point in the stage musical was the song 'Oh What A Night,' played against Bob Gaudio's first sexual experience. In the movie, the moment is played against 'Walk Like A Man,' making a moment which *had* been a simple, universal, celebration of the joy of first time sexual experience into a profoundly offensive homophobic moment - even if not intended as such! Any vestiges of innocence in the scene are removed and 'Oh What A Night' is wasted on a too 'on the nose' intro to the group's reunion for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and then, in the film's worst miscalculation, the broadly danced 'curtain call/credit crawl' which totally violated the spirit and tone of everything else in the film and felt like something staged (by choreographer Sergio Trujillo) for a TV episode of 'How I Met Your Mother'! I did not have a terrible time at the film, but in the end it was such a wasted opportunity. While some on these lists are enjoying the film as much as I wanted to, their enjoyment is not reflected in the empty theatres it is playing to - and in the New York area anyway, the studio seems to have lost faith in the film and pulled all print ads after the first two days of release! We've had disappointing film versions of a number of long run musicals in recent years since the triumphs of DREAM GIRLS and CHICAGO. Things from the modest success of LES MISERABLES to PHANTOM OF THE OPERA to ROCK OF AGES and even MAMMA MIA (the most enjoyable of the last four) probably didn't harm their source shows - most of which actually run on in their original productions! One hopes this JERSEY BOYS won't either. It is mildly enjoyable on its own terms, but it is far less JERSEY BOYS *really* than any of the other film transfers since ANNIE or ...WHOREHOUSE..., and that's a real pity.",6,1,23,22 June 2014
Inception," Elegantly plotted sci-fi / caper film - REQUIRES full attention
","I actually got to a movie yesterday - the second or third in over a year at these prices ($12.95 for a Matinée in Manhattan!!!) and the first that actually gave its full money's worth - something called INCEPTION with nicely understated work (in a very overstated movie) from Leonardo DiCaprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt guided by the well promoted director, Christopher Nolan, of one of those awful Batman films, DARK KNIGHT. This was MUCH better for broader (ie. older) audiences. As a writer, Nolan has come up with a far subtler, better developed idea than the oft cited by younger viewers MATRIX films, and all in a single satisfying work.A lot of print critics, while raving about the new film, said it was 'hard to follow' (it's a science fiction/caper film riffing on themes first well touched on in DREAMSCAPE and PAYCHECK, ramping the concept up several levels by taking the characters and the audience down three or four levels within the guided dream/subconsciousness of the 'mark') but I'm not sure I'd trust the mental facilities of anyone who can't follow it. It's most elegantly laid out if you have affection for the science fiction or caper film genres and the wit to pay attention.It would be easy to want to resist anything this heavily designed with such spectacular CGI effects (Paris folded over on itself, a freight train turning up in the middle of a busy street or a hotel suddenly going weightless) just because of those effects, but Nolan for the most part keeps the mood and lighting light and even better, explains the rules of his created worlds with meticulous care - and even calls his characters when they violate the standards they have laid out (DiCaprio has a complex back story revealed at the perfect pace through the movie). It makes for a thrill ride for those who do pay attention and give themselves over to the fantasy. INCEPTION will almost certainly have its greatest impact on the big screen where the viewers can lose themselves along with the characters in the visuals, but the plotting is so elegant, I suspect it will still work in the inevitable video release.The film is not flawless. The third level of mountain-top/dreamscape 'security' displays a certain failure of imagination and, while exciting in a James Bond reminiscent way, isn't entirely worthy of the other levels of the puzzle. Further, the film DOES require the full attention of the audience to catch all the meticulously placed clues and explanations - especially in the opening which pays off fully near the end and the justification of the 'good guy' nature of the core caper which is all too briefly dropped in mid-film. Stick around through the credits for a full throated playing of the Piaf song used so subtly and well in the film - there's one final audio trick that's a perfect coda to the film.Still, it's all there and the film is legitimately a thinking person's extravaganza. A sci-fi/caper film which challenges the giddy, Terry Gilliam heights of a BARON MUNCHAUSEN visually and blissfully succeeds. Don't bother with it if you're sleep deprived or have no patience for puzzles, but if you like a good caper film (like the non-sci-fi Joseph L. Mankiewicz HONEY POT or any of the more recent OCEAN'S... films) and are willing to be challenged, this is a great summer treat.",8,4,9,18 July 2010
The Good Shepherd," A flawed but fascinating epic
","Robert De Niro's direction of Eric Roth's layered evocation of the early years of the CIA stumbles here and there - not least over the casting of Edward Wilson, the brilliant 'everyman' hardened into a not quite soulless operative by the times and the events he lives through (Matt Damon again pushing the boundaries of what a still young actor can credibly pull off and this time coming up just short, but close enough) - but over all the film soars on so many levels, the intelligent viewer has to be swept along in the sheer intellectual adventure.As with many historical works - and more than most - the more you know of the history which inspired the film, the deeper the impact of work of all concerned. The CIA in recent years had gotten a very bad rap both at home and abroad as its periodic shortcomings have been exposed and through the misguided right wing efforts to justify them or blame them on 'liberals,' and the film does not attempt to change that, although it does show the fair minded the underlying necessity of SOME effective covert intelligence gathering agency.Roth and Di Niro make some aspects of the 50's (in the last half of the film) unrealistically dark - quite clearly neither grew up in the suburbs of Washington where many knew their neighbors worked at Langley, but few (including the wives of these employees) knew exactly what they were doing - or often, where - but the largely top drawer cast elevates the occasional 'spy/thriller' stereotype to literature.Di Niro was able to literally pack the film with some of the best and brightest talents Hollywood and London had to offer and it shows in the hold his by turns mystifying, enthralling and heartbreaking (waiting at the church) story maintains on the audience.Possibly the best example is the young character actor who ultimately brings the balance of the film into focus as the father sees the turning points in his own life in his son's. The son is played by Eddie Redmayne, a British stage actor who has already piled up half a dozen important film credits before opening this month (April 2010) on Broadway in RED - recreating his London role in a dazzling 'two hander' opposite Alfred Molina as modern artist Mark Rothko - almost certain to bring him a Tony nomination at the least. In THE GOOD SHEPHERD, Redmayne's range and power as the son trying to live up to a father impossible to understand and carve out his own life with the values they share gives a texture to the story and a depth to the relationships that is quite dazzling - and the film has character after character doing the same thing (especially telling performances from Michael Gambon as a possible double agent and Oleg Shtefanko as a transparently single one are alone worth the film); creating a real world where we are all to used to seeing only the thinnest of story lines.Some will be reminded of John Le Carre's THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD, a Cold War film that anticipated the end of same, but while set at an earlier time, THE GOOD SHEPHERD is both less bleak and far more sophisticated in it's story telling. Not every twist works, but the whole more than justifies the few parts which fall short.Go with an open mind on the subject and an appreciation for great acting - even in the case of Damon's over carefully restrained one - and you'll realize how much of this film is brilliant. The immediate impression of the film may only be seven of ten stars, but the afterglow is eight or nine.",7,1,2,17 April 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Not an ideal double feature with ALL ABOUT EVE...maybe A DOUBLE LIFE
","A passel of better than average performances - not excluding Edward Norton as a stereotype of the kind of 'method' actor too undisciplined to be a real actor or survive two shows in the real commercial theatre (Dustin Hoffman pulled this off far more amusingly - and surprisingly, more BELIEVABLY in TOOTSIE!) are the chief glories of BIRDMAN. Top billed Michael Keaton goes Oscar fishing with a predictably against type depiction of aging insecurity, but ultimately the cast cannot overcome a script which is at best excellent imitation Mamet, at worst pretentious claptrap.The film strives for artistic credibility - given the nine Oscar nominations, with some success - by Hitchcockian long tracking shots and self conscious close-ups (in part necessitated by the incorporation of the back stage areas of a Broadway house as the set and a kind of third lead) and commercial success by having its leading men in their under shorts or less as often as possible, but as back-stage drama or comedy (it tries to be somewhere in between when not flirting with attempts at soaring fantasy) it struck this viewer as one of the least successful yet put on film.The Mexican writer/director Alejandro Inarritu and the fervent followers he has developed, should have a look at MEETING VENUS (1991), A DOUBLE LIFE (1947) or even, God help us, ALL ABOUT EVE (1950) to see how this sort of thing can actually be done with a sense of reality. It isn't just that the play under consideration pretends to open (as it might have 35 years ago) with less than a week of previews and no 'out-of-town' tryouts, or that actors walk in the lobby of one theatre and into the auditorium of another (one of the most enjoyable aspects of the movie for a theatre person is the street views of the Broadway theatre district circa 2014 - including the homeless man's over-emoting a soliloquy from HAMLET at the start of Keaton's manic depressive hallucination which nearly saves the film) or its depiction of a hate filled Broadway critic which was dated when Cary Grant did it hilariously in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE (1944) or even the old Hollywood trope of an audience member chatting backstage in his dressing room with the lead of a show JUST before he has to make his final entrance in the last scene of the play on Opening Night! Inarritu's model here seems to have been the bizarrely surreal BLACK SWAN (2010) - the first out-loud laugh at the performance I saw followed the most unfortunate parallel to the earlier film near the end. More power to them. If you liked that template (I loathed it), you will probably have a wonderful time at BIRDMAN.One side note: that crack from the daughter about the source story for the play Keaton's character has written and stars in being '50 years old' is a JOKE typical of the film aimed at her immaturity! The story was first published 38 years ago in 1977. For those who were aware of Raymond Carver, his all too brief career (mainly in his last decade) ended with his death AT only 50 in 1980.",4,0,6,17 January 2015
Saving Mr. Banks," Serious thanks to Hanks' Banks film
","Whatever SAVING MR. BANKS' ultimate financial fate - which most sources seem to indicate will probably be comfortable - it was doing something close to 'land office business' when I saw it New Year's Day afternoon on 42nd Street with a very youngish mixed crowd who almost all stayed well into the credit crawl. The very clever gimmick of having the original tape of the actual Mrs. Travers at the reading of the script with the other authors - which was dramatized in the film itself - played over the crawl made them almost impossible to walk out on.The film itself was not, IMHO, a major work of art: they pretty much give away the main element the audience should be figuring out in the film's title and and I have read that a number of the strict historical details are seriously distorted (the cynical will always insist that there was never any real chance of P.J. Travers' withholding the film rights that Disney wanted to her most famous work since she needed the money) but the broad strokes - including that one - are made most believably credible and three perfectly lovely performances from Emma Thompson, Collin Farrell and Tom Hanks (not to mention Paul Giamatti's utterly charming driver, two women in Disney's office and the boys playing the Sherman Brothers - especially B. J. Novak) make it a very enjoyable outing.For me however, and I suspect many of my age, the greatest reason for seeing the film is the rehabilitation (humanization) of Walt Disney's personal image and reputation after all that came out after we grew up about how right wing the man was in his personal/political life. The film speaks to his artistic legacy and it is as charming as the legacy is important. I'd much rather remember the founder of the Mouse House this way than the way I had come to think of him - and I rather doubt that Mrs. Travers would have serious objections either.No-one will deny that the lady reserved the right to formally/officially dislike the Disney MARY POPPINS the way GBS rejected THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER operetta based on his ARMS AND THE MAN, but you will want to see the publicity photos of Travers with Disney and the Sherman Brothers at the end of the film which somewhat soften the image.",7,2,4,2 January 2014
Lucy," A 'straight boy' phenomenon: star and film
","Like her current film - which may well be a kind of apotheosis, summing hp her career to this point - Scarlett Johanssson strikes this viewer as an extremely limited actress who has had the intelligence (or luck) to choose challengingly off-beat projects put together on highly commercially successful models. Her visceral appeal may best be understood by extremely straight boys with hormones raging - the target demographic for many of the violent 'action' films like LUCY turns out to be.Johansson's current film, LUCY, purports to be an examination of the (at one time) oft discussed but somewhat controversial idea (controversial in being overstated more than actually wrong) that most humans only use a small portion of their brain's potential and could achieve untold intellectual (or other) feats if they could access more. It bolsters its advertised claim to seriousness by casting as co-lead the gravitas of Morgan Freeman as a scientist who lectures in the film's first moments on that theory - while Johansson takes the audience into the unrealistic flights of gory and supernatural fantasy the film's creators are really interested in. Long before Freeman's pseudo lecture is over, Johansson's irresponsible character in the film's real plot-line is being sucked into the film's violent chase plot with Chinese drug dealers trying to export an apparently highly addictive blue crystalline drug (whose main 'high' results from opening up greater portions of the brain - a gimmick used in half a dozen recent films with fewer plot gaps) into the west and control same.Four over-sized plastic bags of the drug are surgically packed into the stomachs of apparently kidnapped 'mules' to be flown by normal commercial routes from Taipai to Berlin, Paris and Rome but, for reasons never explained, Johansson is sidetracked into a dungeon before she can catch her U.S. bound flight, apparently to be beaten and raped. The beating ruptures her plastic stomach bag leading to her discovering never logically explained powers both intellectual and psycho-kinetic enabling her escape to search for medical help and starting a violent 'round the world chase. Characters from drug mules to policemen to drug cartel heavies to innocent bystanders are strewn about in celebratory explosions of blood with the utmost carefree abandon which should spell a happy commercial future for audiences of teenage boys - but not so much for fans of serious science fiction.The film does ultimately (with the bad guys closing in - bloody violence continuing unabated) reach Johansson's well advertised use of 100% of her brain's potential and any sense of reality is left behind for the more rarefied reaches of transmogrifying fantasy well trod by second and third tier 'sci-fi' movies and TV fantasy shows long before.If you enjoyed this season's earlier (April 18) Johnny Depp/Morgan Freeman exercise, TRANSCENDENCE, which explored much the same territory with somewhat surer plotting and pacing, you should enjoy this ultra violent action fantasy (to call it legitimate science fiction is a stretch), but the abrupt conclusion of both films once they reached where they said they were going in their ads and the creators ran out of ideas diminishes the impact of LUCY just as it did TRANSCENDENCE.In both cases, some interesting ideas were wasted on ultimately unsatisfying films. That's a real pity in both cases, but at least in the case of LUCY, unless you're in the mood for a 'super shoot 'em up,' you are let down early on. The satisfaction for a appetite for intelligent science fiction is 'lite' at best - and a few more presumably well paid exploitations of his 'gravitas' like these and Morgan Freeman's stock as a serious actor may start to tarnish seriously no matter how high the opening week grosses.",6,1,8,5 August 2014
RED," Primary color, secondary Sara Palinesque fun
","It is hardly surprising that Hollywood would manufacture an obvious fantasy version of the plot of a venial Vice president (or right wingers behind him) ready to have countless people murdered in their quest for power as a vehicle for a group of mature actors to have a fling at an over the top action film.Eight years of Dick Cheney and his minions (and the still current irresponsible gun slinging pronouncements of a later candidate for the office) made the story all too believable. Few seriously made such charges against Cheney openly, but right wingers practically made a cottage industry out of manufacturing fictions they asked to be taken seriously along those lines about their opponents in office for years (the truly venial always think they see the rest of the world when they look in a mirror). Of course Hollywood had been here before with the masterpiece assassin film THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE and lesser films like THE PARALLAX VIEW, but RED (a 'humerus' acronym for Retired, Extremely Dangerous) departs from the best story telling (and reality) by seeming to launch, under extreme provocation (the first half of the film where Bruce Willis, fleeing over-the-top attempts on his life assembles his team of also targeted retired 'spooks'), an an attempted assassination on a right wing politician (in the real world usually only moderates and liberals seem to get shot - but fictional reversal of the political poles seems almost traditional: look at how Alan Drury reversed the behaviors of his 'liberal' and 'conservative' politicians in his ADVISE AND CONSENT and its sequels). The film tries its best not to name the party or the positions of the venial V.P. in question (more an evil Dan Quayle type than a Dick Cheney look-alike) who may have initiated the string of murders, but the visual hints and the people behind him are unmistakable, and since RED is at its heart a comedy of violence, you don't need to worry too much about the politician - although anyone around him is likely to share the fate of minor supporting players on 'away missions' on Star Trek.The cast is 90% of the real fun - from Bruce Willis retreading familiar territory to Morgan Freeman's usual noble support and Helen Mirren's elegance adding 'pistol packing mama' and unexpected comedienne to her resume. Mary-Louise Parker's tag-along phone-in-girlfriend to Willis (kidnapped when he believes her also targeted) comes across as pretty much of an afterthought for plot purposes, but new screenwriter Jon Hoeber (his only major previous credit was the gimmick murder mystery set in Antarctica, WHITEOUT) gives her just enough comic lines to never let her seem like a drag on the story. We don't expect much more than serviceable direction from Robert Schwentke, whose most original work was on THE TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE, trying to expand again on ideas TV had gotten to first (he showed far more subtlety in the 2009 TV Pilot for LIE TO ME), and we don't get it, but he keeps the traffic moving and the explosions popping with (apparently) fewer actors injured than in the previews of the Broadway musical version of SPIDER-MAN, despite the higher body-count blithely depicted here.The ballet of violence played for laughs IS fun if you suspend your disbelief and moral sense - which is the only way to watch this wild exercise in star exploitation. The team assembled and the resolution achieved is so elegant in a MISSION IMPOSSIBLE fashion, one suspects the film makers thought they had a 'caper film' franchise in the making ala OCEAN'S ELEVEN, and they may have, but judging from the scene just before 'the crawl' of credits at the end they apparently realized they could go this way but once while the stars are fresh. Too many TV shows are mining the territory weekly for free.Still, the film is undeniable fun and the mission not quite impossible...just not for the impressionable.",6,1,4,16 January 2011
Her," Very old basic sci-fi concept spun out cheaply with no fresh insight
","Take one of the oldest sci-fi concepts (human interaction, even love, with artificial intelligence; so obvious - bordering on trite - that TV shows from THE BIG BANG THEORY to BONES have all made effective comedy sketch subplots out of it recently), add a promising writer-director like Spike Jonze (ne. Adam Spiegel) who has built a reputation as a promising light weight intellectual with films from BEING JOHN MALKOVICH to ADAPTATION and WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE and mix in a respectable if second tier cast headed by a solid but charisma-challenged Joiquin Phoenix and you'd think Jonze's HER would be a safe, nearly can't miss commercial product. Far too safe, as it turns out, and a commercial miss that looked very much like a mile to this viewer.Jonze's team started off cleverly spending their production money on location shoots in ultra modern cities like Shanghai to create a look just enough like a not immediately recognizable western city only a few years in the future with JUST the right degree of familiarity to emphasize that while working with a sci-fi mind set, the film is based in technology not that different from that which we already have. They are less successful in costuming the central characters in what looks like cheap pickings from the nearest Goodwill thrift store (presumably on the theory that the best way to look forward inexpensively is to look back).The rest of the film follows on that path. Phoenix's Theodore Twombly, a 'writer' living the logical extension of a modern 'service' society where the most minor personal tasks are hired out, is the first of a number of the film's characters who, dealing with a failed relationship, finds solace in a personality created specifically to fit his emotional needs (exceptionally well voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Once one gets past the truism that a real marriage is about much more than sex - that it is, in the long run, about the enrichment of life through the mating of two compatible MINDS, there is nothing particularly shocking or even surprising about this, and Jonze is able to come up with NO fresh insights or twists to the situation.Following the usual 'Midas' version of the way this predictable story usually plays out, the relationship is too initially perfect. The dependence of one side on the other becomes all too predictably extreme while the side better able to adapt outgrows the other. The only way the story CAN resolve itself is in suicide or mature growth. Properly done, one way can be satisfying hope, the other classic tragedy. A potentially GREAT resolution could leave the final resolution in the mind of the audience - telling as much about their lives as the underlying story. Unfortunately, Jonze is not yet a great writer or director, however superficially he tries to pull off a resolution which would argue he were if it had only worked.Most of the friends who told me how much they loved Spike Jonze's HER emphasized the warmth of the feelings expressed by the 'lovers' and how satisfying they found the execution. I'm afraid I was too wide awake to be swept into Jonze's sleepy fantasy - especially when he keeps throwing incongruities in his audience's face (there are gross copyright questions in the central character publishing a book of letters he has written on contract FOR third parties midway in). In the end, while I remained wide awake for the whole 126 minutes (feeling more like 252), emotionally I was right with the poor boy sitting the row in front of me who had to ask his girl friend during the credits what had happened during the last quarter hour when he had fallen asleep. At least he didn't snore.Not a good afternoon - all the more disappointing because HER might have been in more creative hands.",3,2,6,8 February 2014
