The Blair Witch Project," Will there be a next time?
","I sure hope not. But if there is, put something besides inexperienced actors and pathetic filming into play.This movie was B-O-R-I-N-G and had little effect on me, the characters were stale, and the acting terrible. The only thing that held its own weight was the story which is original and interesting. But Steven and James (Cameron that is) could have done it better. I hope these college kids find some good stuff to spend all that royalty money on. NOT another movie like this one I hope.",Null,0,1,19 December 1999
American Pie," Porkys? I think not!
","This movie is nothing like Porkys. For one, Porkys was good. I grew up with it. Sexual humor is fine, I love movies that you can kick back with. But THIS flick.... If I said what I really thought of it my comments would NEVER be accepted.I would expect Thomas Ian to go for better movies than this, he's got some good talent. Utterly wasted on this flick. zip out of 10.",Null,0,0,21 December 1999
Man on the Moon," Get ready for the Oscars...
","'Man On the Moon' is a winner. So is Jim Carrey, who took the character he was given and ran with it. What a strange event, that the same wrestler who landed Andy in a neck brace also injured Jim. MOTM is a beautifully made film with good, decent acting (for once!) and kept me interested all the way through. As a life-long Kaufman fan I was thrilled with the movie and Carrey's performance. This time around, he deserves best actor. I've never really been a big fan of Carrey but I am changing my tune surely. I'm glad that Carrey had enough respect for Kaufman to do him justice. But then maybe Andy was really poking through... Who knows.8 out of 10",Null,0,1,20 December 1999
The Elephant Man," Forget Titanic and Star Wars...
","Want to see a real movie? See this one. Truly, The Elephant Man is one of the greatest films ever made and yet it is so unrecognized. Anthony Hopkins and superb, as is John Hurt with his moving performance as John Merrick. I have never seen or felt such a film that touched my heart so much. 10/10",Null,1,2,27 May 2000
Scream 2," Enough already!
","I have heard there's a third Scream movie in the works...please don't! Two was bad enough. A bunch of little teenage girlies running around trying to escape a serial killer. That cliche I don't mind but find another cast and another plot line. It looks like bad episodes of Moesha, Friends, and Party of Five all rolled into one.",Null,0,0,5 August 1999
Bring It On," Grow up, Kirsten
","This movie was dumb. What can I say? It was meant to be dumb. The scene when the dance instructer asked the girls to skip meals to lose weight really made me sick, although the rest of the movie was so-so.
I've been a Kirsten Dunst fan for years, but I have to say she been cast in some really lousy flicks lately. She has talent but she should use it with her mind instead of her body. I noticed that her seemingly 'perfect' body is shown off way too much in her movies. Yes she is beautiful but she has talent, somebody tell her agent to get Kirsten some MIND movies (if that makes sense).Anyway, back to the movie.....oh, did I say it was lousy?",Null,0,0,5 September 2000
Apollo 13," Representation of a great director!
","It's often difficult for a director to really touch the heart of his viewers. However, Ron Howard is one who does this again and again and again.At the end of Apollo 13, when the astronauts break through, it's so hard not to want to get up and yell, scream, cry, and cheer for those guys. I have seen this movie a hundred times and each time I tense up when the guys are missing and I always cry when they make it. It takes a damn good director to do this type of work. I give this movie a 10 and Ron Howard a 15.",10,0,1,9 July 1999
