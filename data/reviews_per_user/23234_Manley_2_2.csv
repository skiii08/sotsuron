Alien 3," A throwback to old times
","While many have villified this film for being disappointing after high expectations, personally I loved it.  After Aliens took the saga in a high tech, shoot-em-up direction, Fincher decided to change it up and take it back to its roots where it was more human vs. alien instead of humans with huge guns vs. alot of aliens.  I found this film to be much more personal and to me it translated very well from screen to audience.  Fincher's aggressive style played well into the story, and its my personal favorite of the saga, well, maybe Alien is a little better.",Null,0,2,20 December 2002
Spider-Man," Blockbuster with heart
","Although Spider-Man was presented as your typical summer blockbuster action visual butt-kickin type movie, which it was, it was so much more.  I almost started crying with joy when I found out Sam Raimi was slated to direct this film.  I knew he would bring something new and fresh to the whole blockbuster scene.  Also Tobey Maguire might be the best casting decision since Ewan Macgregor as Obi-Wan.  This combination was setting the stage for an incredible experience.  Although I'm not much of a comic book fan, Spider-Man is my favorite comic book character.  So take all of this and what do you get?  A blockbuster with heart.  Not only is it a great movie, its a good movie.  It hit the large scale production but did not lose the personal touch of a small art house film.  I would not go so far as to compare this to an art house film, but the surprising heart this movie displays makes it seem that way. I cannot think of any weak points in this film.  Even the overwhelming campiness of the conversation between the Green Goblin and Spider-man is lost in the fun of the moment.  You can tell Raimi isn't used to filming a grand scale fight scene, but he pulls it off rather admirably.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful this film is, to the very basic elements, to the complicated ones.  Raimi thought this film through from beginning to end, and Macguire cemented himself as the ultimate troubled young adult actor. You can even take your girlfriend to go see this.  There is truly something for everyone.  Seriously, if you don't like this movie, I wouldn't wonder why you don't have many friends.",Null,0,0,20 December 2002
