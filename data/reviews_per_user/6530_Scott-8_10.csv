Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This wasn't a Star Wars film
","If I was a die hard fan who sat six weeks waiting to get in to see this movie, then you might think, well, you were expecting too much.  No, I'm an average movie goer who snuck in to the early Friday show.This was awful!  I felt more like someone had licensed the 'Star Wars' franchise and made a big budget overblown rip-off.  I can't believe this was made by the same man who did the original, I only hope Lucas opts out on directing the next two.The dialog was stale, the pacing was off, the lines were read, not spoken, the music didn't have any memorable rhythm and intruded more than accentuated, and things like the two headed announcer seemed a little too earth like.Lucas even rewrote some of what made his original movies so good.But what I hated most about the movie wasn't the character everyone loves to hate- Jar Jar Binks, it was cute little Anakin Skywalker.  I've never understood why film makers want to stick in a kid to make it more 'appealing,' the effect is more often to ruin the film.  And Jake Lloyd just isn't right for the part- THIS is going to be Darth Vader?Not only that, we are told over and over about how wonderful and intelligent and here to save us Anakin is, and how he's the 'chosen one.'  If Lucas expected us to feel foreboding at the tragedy that will forefall Anakin, he missed the mark.  I was more irritated at how Anakin seemed to be there for product placements for games and toys.George, you blew it this time, big.  But you can still save it; let someone else direct, spin Jar Jar off into a Saturday morning show, and ditch the kid.  Especially the kid.",Null,0,1,23 May 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Awful Movie, waste of time
","I had high hopes for 'Alien Resurrection' when I saw it last summer, since I think nearly everyone feels the third movie was a weak entry.  I was both revulsed and turned off by AR, and when I saw it again on cable recently my feelings were only confirmed.The original Alien was one of the first movies that used the 'doom and gloom' view of the future to good effect.  Everything's dark and murky, spaceships look more like industrial waste yards, and the view of people and society is cynical.  The first few times you see it that approach is different or interesting, but now it seems every aspiring sci-fi movie uses it.  Will somebody please turn on the lights?The makes of AR forgot one key element of making this approach work is giving someone for the audience to care about.  Ripley's dead, now we have a cloned half human hybrid who spouts wonderful lines like 'Who do I have to f$%! to get off this ship?', a gang of smugglers who kidnapped colonists to use as hosts for the aliens, and a bunch of soldiers and scientists on 'the other' side.  The only person in the entire movie who I cared lived or died was the poor infested colonist who ended up getting blown away as the alien was about to burst out of his chest.Sigourney Weaver overdoes her creepy hybrid human but, let's just say you can tell she was the executive producer. Dan Hedaya I honestly thought was playing his part for laughs, which jarred in an otherwise gloomy movie.Lots of running around and shooting, with the heroes using weapons that looked like they were cobbled together from spare plumber's pipe. It got to the point I wondered what color blood/entrails would be splashed across the screen next as people and aliens died in various creative ways.The 'final showdown' with the newborn alien, who is supposed to be a hybrid that's more alien, was ridiculous and incredibly revolting.  Did we really have to see every detail of it being sucked out a hole into space?I've heard they're committed to making a fifth movie, after this entry I certainly hope not.  They can keep cranking out Star Trek movies until the end of time, but I think this series is dead",1,5,10,8 December 1998
The Fifth Element," I love this movie
","The Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies.  At least some of the reason I like it so much was I first saw it right after I'd had some bad times in my life, and it was a real break to watch something that was just plain FUN.Most people who don't like this movie probably either expected an action film or sci-fi adventure.  It's neither and both at the same time.  Just sit back and enjoy it, don't bother trying to rationalize.  A wonderful, exotic soundtrack, humor and comedy in spades, and a future New York that has COLOR.  Most people are so used to the dark and grim future bit that seeing a world brightly lit and animated is a sight for sore eyes.  You have to admit it takes a certain chutzpah to decorate the President's office in lavender!",Null,0,1,7 February 1999
Batman Returns," Yecch!
","If you can picture in your mind a bad recipe that produces a movie, this would be the likely result.  Add in one part Christmas movie, one part Dickens atmosphere, two parts great set design, 5 parts of the previous Batman movie, and 327 parts of a villain more disgusting then evil, half bake it, and you get this.I like Danny Devito, but his grotesquely malformed Pengiun constantly drooling green stuff was too much.  Michael Keaton and Michelle Pefeiffer try, but can't rise above the material.  Still, it it brings a smile to my face thinking of a zoo keeper getting a phone call from Hollywood, 'You need 1,000 penguins for WHAT?'",Null,2,4,25 December 1998
Predator," Schwarzennegger in his prime
","In the mid to late eighties it seemed as if Arnold Schwarzennegger could do no wrong.  Practically every movie he made was successful, people loved him, and things were good.  'Predator' is typical of the movies he was turning out, just enough schlock and humor to add some fun, serious enough to get your attention, and gobs of special effects and action.  Carl Weathers and Jesse Ventura complement rather than compete in the drama, and there's enough shoot outs and one-liners for everyone.  (Bad Idea, Stick Around.)What's always stuck in my mind about this movie was where the final battle took place, a forest with huge trees and an almost primeval look to it. I've always felt the director was trying to symbolize going to the basic instincts of survival and conflict; when the identity, race, and origin is stripped away, and all that is left is two beings fighting to the end. Maybe I'm just reading in too much.Most people would agree that 'Terminator Two' was the peak of Arnold's acting talent, but 'Predator' is a sample of what he did when making hit movies was his bread and butter.",Null,0,0,31 March 1999
Armageddon," Absolutely Bad
","In my deepest hopes I'd like to think that somewhere in Hollywood one of the producers of 'Armageddon' wakes up after a fitful night of sleep, splashes cold water in his face, and looks at himself in the mirror, thinking, 'My God, what have I done?'  But I know the truth is they're thinking 'people went to see this movie, let's make more!'It's easy to see what they were planning on; take the formula of 'The Rock,' add in some good 'ole boy characters to liven it up, and a healthy dose of patriotism, and you get a movie everyone will love and have a good time with.At least 'Armageddon' showed me what happened to all the Junior High drop outs who never did anything but get into trouble ended up at, they're working on off-shore oil rigs.  A key to any movie is liking or identifying with the main characters; but here they're like the loud next door neighbors, you just wish they'd go away.  When they get let out to see 'what they're trying to save' and they make a beeline to a strip joint, maybe we're better off getting pulverized by the asteroid.And in a tradition that runs from Fred Flintstone and Archie Bunker, brawn and know-how takes the place of training and skill.  I'd love to see it where a highly trained and educated scientist or engineer can do the job, rather than Bruce Willis stepping in the door and telling everyone in two minutes how things ought to be done.Finally, about all the scenes of run down small town America with little kids running around in denim overalls toting US flags and toy space shuttles- let me put it to you this way, I'm an American midwesterner in a small town, and I couldn't believe the false patriotic hype.  May this movie mercifully slide into obscurity.",Null,0,1,5 April 1999
Armageddon," A farce, plain and simple
","'Armageddon' was made by the many of same people who did 'The Rock.'  Both are loud, hyperactive, and quick on the draw.  But whatever worked for 'The Rock' doesn't here.  The 'heroes' come across as such a bunch of jerks you almost wish they would die anyway.  What can you say when when the call comes to save the world and your response is lead the police and helicopters on a motorcycle chase?The asteroid looked more like someone's art school project, and the space scenes have great special effects but are shot in such a cartoon style you can't even tell what is going on half the time.  Wherever the movie tries to be serious it falls flat, seeming more silly or desperate than dramatic.Maybe next time the producers should film lots of special effects, scenes of the stars doing, well, stuff, and mix in a rock an roll soundtrack.  Why bother with a plot?  That's not too far from what this movie is.",Null,0,1,28 December 1998
North by Northwest," An all-time classic
","'North by Northwest' is one of those movies that is both ageless and squarely set in a different time.  I enjoyed it as a child, and I still like it now.Newer movies have bigger explosions, more special effects, and more sex, but Hitchcock showed you can make suspense just by careful editing and development of the story.Cary Grant was in top form in this movie, and it goes without saying there will never be another like him.  He had just the right balance of suave, intelligence, and bravado to pull it off.  Other actors trying the same thing would either come across as a smart aleck or a foppish intellectual.'North by Northwest' is a true classic.",Null,0,1,12 February 1999
Aliens," Still one of the best action movies
","Unless you've lived on a remote island in the pacific for the past decade and a half, you had to have heard of 'Aliens.'  It's a non-stop thrill ride with enough near escapes and to the draw shoot outs to satisfy anyone.  The only time it ever slows down is to explain more of the plot, otherwise you wouldn't know what's happening.It also is a perfect follow-on to the original.  The first movie was high suspense more like a horror story, this one is akin to a war movie but on the same theme.That aside, 'Aliens' has some qualities that set it above most other action movies.  In the short time span of a movie each character comes across as an individual (except for the aliens) and we get to know them.  The child actress who played Newt was also perfect for the part and had a very strong and fitting relationship with Sigourney Weaver's character.It's a shame this movie has been followed by two successively worse sequels, not only does 'Aliens' stand out because it's so good, but because it's also plausible to the mind.  The weapons, equipment, and technology seem like later developments of what we have today.  You can also easily picture a future where corporations run everything and don't care about the foot soldier.  Some people would say that's the way it is today.",Null,0,0,9 January 1999
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Shoulda, Coulda, Woulda,
","But didn't.  This movie had all the right elements, but it just seems to miss.  It's a visually opulent movie, it captures the look and feel of the victorian age better than most any movie I've seen.  Excellent special effects blend in with the imagery, as often we see several events happening at once on screen.  Thankfully this movie only indulges slightly in the MTV video inspired zig-zag mile a second camera action so many modern movies use.  The cast was wonderful, and it's more true to the original story than probably any other Dracula movie.So where did it go wrong?I'd say most of the problem was a weak story; fantastic and wonderful images are placed on screen, but there's not much to tie them together.  There's too much gore for a movie that claims to have a love story at the center, and finally Gary Oldman appears in more incarnations than you can count. He's a fine actor, but when you don't know what he's supposed to be from one moment to the next - it gets confusing.  Still, the imagery makes the movie worth watching.",Null,0,0,20 February 1999
