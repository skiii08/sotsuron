The Blair Witch Project," Very scary in hindsight
","Too many people have complained that this film isn't scary, thats is boring, that that characters are stupid, etc, without putting proper thought into it.  This is one of those movies that is scary after the actual event, rather than being scary while you're watching it.  At first I was quite disappointed, but once I discussed it with my friends and began to work things out and piece things together, I realised that most of the time the trio are lost in the woods is very suspenseful and leads up to a spooky finale with a very haunting closing image.So, my point is, don't go and see this film if you're not prepared to have a good, long think about it. If you pay attention and stay alert during the sometimes irritating (but infamous) camerawork, then you're in for one of the best, most original films on the decade. 8/10",Null,0,0,16 December 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," based on Shakespeare?!
",">spoiler warning<This movie is hardly based on 'Taming of the Shrew'. It's just another addle-minded, cliched teen film whose plot just happens to share certain elements with TOTS. I hope there are no people out there who've watched this and thought 'wow, i never realised how good Shakespeare is!' but I have a terrible feeling that there are. The references back to the play are incredibly obvious - wouldn't it have been more clever if they were a little more subtle? (BTW, having last names, high schools etc named from the play isn't particularly subtle). Julia Stiles gives a great performance as the bitter Kat Stratford, even though she is surrounded by not-so-great actors and a lousy script which is full of holes. Would you forgive someone for doing something really mean to you if they bought you a guitar? I didn't think so.Worth a look, definitely better than its contemporary 'she's all that', but don't expect too much from it.",Null,0,0,17 January 2000
