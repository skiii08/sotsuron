National Treasure: Book of Secrets," national treasure- both book of secrets and the first are a favorite of mine
","When I herd this movie was coming out I was excited. I truly loved National Treasure, the first movie. I was also nervous too since it was an opportunity for disappointment. I also hoped Book of Secrets would get National Treasure some additional attention and praise that, in my opinion, the original deserved.National Treasure Book of secrets is a great movie, and one thats fun to watch, with an upbeat mood. The first National Treasure is one of my personal all time favorites, one reason being it's one of those movies I can watch again from time to time, and appreciate it every time.It's surprising that I did enjoy book of secrets as much as I did, since I expected a lot from it. It does have it's points that could have been better. Riley is still the geek but much better looking I noticed... and we get to meet Bens mother. I liked how all the actors who played the main characters were also in Book of Secrets. Ben Gates, Patrick Gates, Riley Poole, Abigale Chase, and Sadusky were in both films and were awesome together.Some elements of the first movie that I liked did not appear in the second. My favorite elements from the first movie that did get captured into the second, plus some additional elements, were just enough to make this movie a hit for me.I'm happy that they decided to make a sequel to national treasure, because it would only make sense to me... but although I liked book of secrets, it don't beat the original.",9,0,2,27 January 2008
