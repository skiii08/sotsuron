Minority Report," Good film, huge plot holes.
","There was no evidence to lead him to his son's 'killer' to murder him in the first place, so that section was a huge paradox.Also, at the end when Burgess and Anderton face off, they have no idea that the precogs had seen a murder, they had not been in contact with anyone at the temple.  So Cruise talked him out of killing him without any knowledge of the future, so the precogs would never have predicted it.Maybe these things were explained in the book, I haven't read it so i don't know, but they were glaring holes in the film.",7,0,0,28 December 2002
L.A. Confidential," Simply Perfect
","Normally, no matter how good a film is, there are moments where you think (in that unqualified, ignorant arrogant way all film go-ers, whether ocassional or regular, have) 'I wouldn't have done it like that', or 'that would have been better if they did this'.  I can't find a single moment like that in this film.  I walked out of the cinema with a feeling of elation I have never been able to match, and numerous re-watchings haven't dulled a moment of my enjoyment. The cast is perfect, inhabiting their roles with absolute conviction.  The plot is clever in an age where most Hollywood films are insultingly stupid. Marvelous.",10,1,2,13 January 2002
Gangs of New York," Edited to pieces, saved by the final third (Day Lewis ruled)
","You could literally see in a couple of scenes where bits were cut out.  The first two thirds were pretty uninteresting, as if they had kept only what was needed for the plot (and even then there were some pretty big jumps in logic).Once Amsterdam had set himself up in opposition against The Butcher the pace picked up and the film was a lot more enjoyable (this was to late for a friend of mine who had already walked out through boredom), but overall it was disappointing.I could definitely believe rumours of a great 4 hour version sitting around somewhere, but the cinema release was sub-standard for Scorsese.",7,0,0,20 February 2003
