The Longest Yard," Awful movie!!! I want my money back!!!!!!!!!!! -10 out of 10
",I saw this movie and want my hard earned money back!!!! The original was a 10 out of 10. This movie is a -10 out of 10. Adam Sandler was horrible! Chris Rock was O.K.! and the rest of the cast including Nelly should not have even been cast. Movies like this remind me of how overpaid some actors are and how stupid we are to actually pay money to see an over-hyped and over-commercialized piece of dung that Hollywood is making these days. Hollywood should pay us to see movies like this!!! Adam Sandler was not even believable and had no charisma. I felt like I wanted the guards to beat up the convicts and win. I thought maybe Chris Rock would have made a better star than a supporting cast member. I think I would have had a better time renting 'Tommy Boy' and buying a six-pack than watching this lame movie.,1,5,11,2 June 2005
