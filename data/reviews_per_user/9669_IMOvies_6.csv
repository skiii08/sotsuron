The Blair Witch Project," Who needs SFX and big budgets?
","BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, THE (1999) **1/2 (D: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo Sanchez) - Made cheaply for around $60,000, this succeeds as a novelty using a camcorder and a noble return to 'suggestive old time horror'. Proves you don't necessarily need a large budget and special effects to make an effective little horror flick. Tries to scare its audience rather than dazzle them, and pretty much accomplishes that.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Immature and confusing; then again, I'm no STAR WARS fan
","STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE PHANTOM MENACE (1999) *1/2 (D:George Lucas) - Immature and confusing, but then again I'm not a fan of the STAR WARS franchise anyway. Jar Jar Binks gets on my nerves; the new kid actor displays little flair for the craft and is unconvincing as a youthful Darth Vader; Liam Neeson and his partner make for a good team; the villain is good albeit too short-lived. But the good points are lost in a maze of whirling SFX and muppet-like creatures, with minimal attention paid to a storyline. At the time of its release even diehard fans were disappointed.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
Blade," Not too bad
","BLADE (1998) **1/2 (D:Stephen Norrington) - Wesley Snipes plays it fairly straight. Kris Kristofferson is well-used as the mentor of the half-vampire Blade. Stephen Dorff makes for a good villain, and Udo Kier is even on hand as a member of the Undead. A dark, solid action film (like BATMAN '89). Its liabilities include too many vampire obscenities and those typically awful CGI effects.",Null,0,1,10 October 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Better than I expected, but not 'Great'
","DR. STRANGELOVE (1964)**1/2 (of ****)(possible spoilers)I'm not big on 'political' movies by any stretch, and I didn't expect to like this film at all. Yet I actually got a few chuckles out of it and was kept moderately entertained. I'm a big fan of George C. Scott and I don't believe I've ever seen him like this before or since... he was a riot as the over-the-top general who is constantly suspicious of the 'Russkies'.Peter Sellers was a delight as the President, and some of the best moments of the film revolve around him on the telephone and his interactions with Scott. I wasn't much impressed with the other two roles played by Sellers, however, and Dr. Strangelove in particular was silly and annoying.Not a drop-dead-laugh-a-minute film, and certainly Overrated and in no way 'great,' but I did get more out of it than I thought I would.",Null,0,2,22 September 2003
Blade II," The epitome of what's wrong with today's horror films
","BLADE II (2002) (BAD) (D: Guillermo del Toro) - Everything is wrong with this mess, and typical of recent films in the horror genre: All action and SFX, nothing else. And this time the computer effects are insultingly bad...the characters do nothing but fight each other with what resembles artificial Computer Game People plugged in every so often, looking fake and cartoonish. This film is very long and very mind-numbing and boring, despite the nonstop action pounding all around you. Ugly, dark and dingy, with uninteresting characters everywhere and lousy rap 'music' thrown in regularly for extra bad measure. This crap is the epitome of all I despise in motion pictures today.",Null,1,1,10 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Good, but not quite PULP FICTION (SPOILERS)
","KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 (2003) *** (D: Quentin Tarantino) - Uma Thurman is great in her role as a vengeful femme fatale in a film that's good, if not great. PULP FICTION was better, but KILL BILL VOL. 1 still has much of the vintage Tarantino style that fans devour. It's fun, but uneven and disjointed. I'd just like to take a moment to praise the opening scene of the film; it's positively brilliant and compelling.The action sequences deliver the goods but perhaps push the credibility factor somewhat (I had a tough time accepting that Thurman alone could so easily defeat an army of sword-wielding Asians!), and I could have done without the cartoon segment. Other than that, the fight scenes were entertaining if bordering on overkill at times. In fact, as for the controversy surrounding Miramax's decision to split the film into two parts... while I did have a good time for 90 plus minutes or so, I'm ultimately glad they did it; I for one was ready for Intermission Time by the end of the picture.",Null,0,0,10 October 2003
