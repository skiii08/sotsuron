The Blair Witch Project," It Plays Tricks On Your Mind
","*Possible spoilers*. Now, I like this movie. A lot of people say, 'its not scary' or 'the camera work was awful' etc etc. I personally couldn't disagree more.I like the fact that you are like another character in this film, you see everything they see, you hear what they hear, and it DOES scare you.
You never see the witch, so it feeds your imagination. The suspense is terrifying, because anyone can make the witch scary. You can build up images in your head, and there are no limits. As for gore, that's not scary, its just disgusting. There are too many films where all that happens is a bunch of teenagers get sliced up - not exactly scary. Suspense, tension, imagination - these are the ingredients that make a horror film.The scariest films in history have these ingredients, and maybe the Blair Witch Project isn't one of them, but its better than so many other Hollywood rejects. It is chilling, but you can't just sit there expecting to be scared. You have to get involved, you have to make it scary - imagine, see it from the characters point of view, then be chilled.",Null,0,1,21 October 2002
Bridget Jones's Diary," Sweet, Witty and British
","Bridget Jones. I love her. I really do. That's why I think everyone loves this film, because so many women can say: 'That's me!'. The jokes are mainly at Bridget's expense, and there are times when you cringe for her. Overall, its a sweet feel good film about falling in love. Its witty, charming and very adorable.",Null,0,0,20 October 2002
