The Blair Witch Project," more about marketing than movie making
","The Blair Witch Project only works if you believe it's real. It's an experiment not only in film, but more importantly in marketing and promotion. I knew a lot of people who truly believed that what they were watching was real footage. The Blair Witch Project is only scary on that level. Otherwise, it's a jumpy, obnoxious experiment into the gullible nature of todays society. I personally found it annoying, but then again, I never thought it was real. The only scary thing about the film is the amount of uninformed idiots there are walking around who will believe anything they hear. I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this film as a work of fiction. The audience was cheated out of their money by clever promotion. Who knows, this could be the movie of the future. Little production costs equal huge profits.",4,0,2,4 May 2002
Spider-Man," didn't have to be so lame
","Why was this movie so lame? Why was the dialogue so horrible? Why did normally good actors suck? The cheese factor was through the roof. Why does Hollywood dumb down everything? I want answers. Actually, nevermind, I don't even care. This movie is not worth seeing, so don't go see it. Trust me. All hype, no substance.",4,0,0,1 November 2002
