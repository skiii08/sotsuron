Blade Runner 2049," An Insult to the Original
","Although the original Blade Runner didn't do well at the Box Office, and became a cult classic later on, it is still remains a classic today. It is extremely watchable, a decent story line, and a chilling but totally realistic vision of the future. This sequel is completely the opposite. At a running time of 2hr 44mins, this movie is so slow to start off with, with Deckard not even appearing until after an hour. The story line is an insult to the original, with a long winded drawn out very basic story stretched out even further with a ridiculous sub-plot about a virtual girlfriend. All the virtual girlfriend scenes should have been cut, it would have made for much better viewing. Another annoying thing is that the original Blade Runner had no profanity in the movie, so why fill this one with such words? It's obvious this was a corporate money making venture with little respect for the original. For me, the original Blade Runner is best as a 'stand-alone'. My verdict: Avoid.",2,12,25,12 October 2017
Blade Runner," Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
","In anticipation of the sequel, I watched the original Blade Runner for the first time in 30 years. I was blown away by how good this movie actually is. As a vision of the future it is almost perfect, and even when watching it in 2017, there is nothing that implies it was made in 1982; this movie has not aged at all. In fact is is so good as a 'stand alone', that I'm hoping the sequel doesn't ruin it. The future is exactly how one would imagine it to be, the story is set within the realms of extreme possibility, and the acting is believable. Recommended.",8,3,4,3 October 2017
