Blade Runner 2049," too much too soon
","I looked forward to seeing this sequel and enjoyed it . but I agree it was too long (even ridley scott says so). but all in all it was an interesting and entertaining movie. good acting, good story, acceptable ending. my biggest gripe with it is this, it's set too soon in the future. all the tech that is portrayed in it just seems too much, too soon for a time period of 30 years. maybe 2149 would have seemed about right. even so, well worth watching.",8,1,4,30 December 2017
Justice League," no 'justice' for some
","Having just rewatched Justice League I am disappointed in the writing and some of the cgi. as others have stated Superman often looks too much like he is in a video game. but it's the backstory of the Flash that bothers me. everyone who reads the comic or watches the tv show knows that Barry Allen works in a crime lab and it was there he was struck by lightning that transformed him. why is it so hard for the writers to stay true to the original. it added nothing to this Flash to have his story changed. I enjoy Ezra Miller in the role but Ben Affleck just doesn't cut it as Bruce Wayne/Batman. Aquaman is ok in small bits as is Cyborg. never can have too much Wonder Woman/ Gal Gadot. she is my vision of the real Wonder Woman as a child reading her comic. overall, I enjoyed the movie but there was a lot of things that did not do justice to the story and characters.",7,2,4,18 February 2018
