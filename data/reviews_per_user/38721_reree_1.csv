Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Movie Can't Stand on Its Own
","The weeks before the movie, I was disappointed to see that every critic that saw the Phantom Menace was panning it.  I was determined that they were doing so just to be different, and that the success and goodness of this were inevitable.  Well it was not so.  The problem with episode 1 is that it is not its own movie, the only highlights came with references to other moments from the first three movies.  The villain is weak, the kid is taken from Home Alone or something, and in general it was just bad.",Null,0,1,19 May 1999
