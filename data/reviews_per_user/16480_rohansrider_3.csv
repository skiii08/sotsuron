Black Swan," ... and the Oscar goes to (not Natallie Portman)
","I viewed Black Swan with women only, all of whom did not like it. They found it offensive, disturbing and not as good as they had hoped. Many critics on IMDb have already found the flaws in the film so I shall not repeat. Portman is a little one dimensional. She is so uptight as the actress never mind her character. I found Nina Sayers irritating and could not sympathize with her. Winona Ryder should have had more screen time as the role of Beth was perfect for her. There is so much which is implausible about the film that the good bits such as art direction, music and atmosphere are somewhat lost. I really wanted to like this film as from the trailers I inferred that it would be top notch - not so. Rather disappointing as I felt something was truly missing and it never jumped out at me. The bad script did not help, it was more than bad it was appalling. Was it horror? Was it thriller? Was it just the story of a repressed girl who was totally unsuitable to be a ballerina? Come the Oscars, I think Jennifer Lawrence from Winter's Bone would be a worthier winner. Portman is a fine actress but was unable to quite deliver in the role; simply put she was too uptight. Judging by so many other negative reviews the film has not lived up to its hyperbole.",7,0,2,6 February 2011
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Not as good as I had hoped.
","Interesting views here; terribly polarized. Appears to be a love it or hate it movie and as for me I think I know why its detractors were so disappointed. Given the wonderful ensemble cast I think they expected a stronger plot line and narrative building up to the revelation of the 'mole'. This did not happen and because the film was too short the final few minutes with the 'mole ' revealed were a let-down. I usually love a good thriller/whodunnit but this did not measure up. I challenge anyone to declare that they knew who was the mole by evidence shown. I don't think Smiley was really sure an in any case there were no definitive reasons given for why the 'mole' was a double-agent. I found Smiley rather tedious and I did have the odd yawn. The flash back technique was at times confusing, and the film feels to be rather pretentious,almost implying that it's very cerebral and if you don't like it then you must be a moron. I am not a moron; I was not expecting an action packed film by any means but this was too slow. The lack of character development was also a mistake. It falls into the category to watch again on DVD and maybe I will appreciate the nuances and tiny clues. As someone already said not suited for the big screen. For me Tom Hardy stood out with Cumberbatch also very competent. Hurt was playing himself as usual, the rest were not that noteworthy except for Kathy Burke's small role which was excellent. It did capture the mood and drabness of the seventies very well and the cinematography was faultless; look out for an Oscar or BAFTA in that category.",Null,2,3,5 October 2011
Legends of the Fall," Simpy one of the best, so where were the Oscars?
","I rarely give ten but this film is one of the best that I am ever likely to see. So much praise already so I only have this to say.It shows how very foolish are the members of the Academy for not lavishing this movie with a batch of Oscars. Thecast were so well balanced. Julie Ormond was perfect in this role,sadly we don't see much of her now. She has a fragility on the screen which other actresses don't have. A young Brad Pitt is a revelation in this film and as always Aidan Quinn totally reliable. Hopkins is perfectly cast as the gruff father who adores his sons but cannot hold onto his wife. The total futility of war is more than proved in this movie. It is Samuel who sets off a terrible chain of events by going to fight the Hun ( as they were referred to). A once loving family are torn to pieces and the dreadful irony was that it all could have been prevented. Suzanna loved Samuel but Tristan sent her wild and poor Alfred the serious older brother who adores her also, has to wait patiently in the background. The real tragedy is Susanna's infertility juxtaposed with Isabel Twos fertility. The narration of One Stab was a masterstroke, especially as he never spoke English when addressing the characters. A great story that is very easy on the eye with wonderful cinematography. Look out for the 1080p blu-ray version.",10,0,3,26 June 2011
