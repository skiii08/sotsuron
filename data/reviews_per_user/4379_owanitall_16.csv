Ford v Ferrari," On the edge of my seat. And I don't even like car racing.
","At one point during the movie I looked at Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon) and wondered how he, with his bad heart, doesn't drop dead watching those races, especially one where so much is at stake. Because I was watching it on the screen and my heart was pounding like crazy. And here is the weirdest thing - I have exactly zero interest in car racing. Yet when I nearly stopped watching, it wasn't because I was bored nor because there was something wrong with the film, it was because it was so intense, I was getting too stressed out. I knew absolutely nothing about the real life story. I do wonder how I would have reacted if I did. But as it were I was not only completely engrossed the entire time, even looking back I couldn't find a single flaw. And believe me, I tried. It's like that race car they built - no frills, but the power to do precisely what it takes to succeed.",10,1,3,22 January 2020
Rocketman," It's trying to be magical, but I could see the strings
","There is a scene towards the end of the movie in which young Reggie Dwight (Matthew Illesley) asks for a hug and finally receives one - from the grown up Elton John (Taron Egerton). That scene is a perfect illustration of why this film should have been great and why it ultimately didn't work for me. At its core Rocketman is by the numbers musician's biopic - early natural talent, meteoric rise to fame and fortune, alchohol and drugs, an abusive partner/manager that nearly gets him killed. I felt like I saw that same movie last year. Luckily for the filmmakers, Elton's songs not only provided ready chunks of the script, they also made those moments when characters burst into song almost organic. I cringed when characters other than Elton would start to sing though. This would work in a stage musical where you expect everyone to sing. And it does sometimes works in movies. Here it felt weird. The dance numbers, though disappointingly generic looking, did manage to illustrate the mood of the moment. Most of the time. The problem is that in order to make a movie that injects fantasy into reality like that one needs to do something akin to magic. There are times when the movie achieves precisely that, like the attempted suicide scene in the pool. But too often what we get are these obvious symbolisms, which I personally dislike. People lifted off their feet by Elton's performance. Elton gradually removing parts of his elaborate costume - he is peeling off the layers of fake persona and revealing the real person underneath. And the scene I mentioned in the beginning - Elton hugging his young self - look, he learned to love himself. It's like they are trying to do magic, but I could see the strings.",6,0,1,16 January 2020
A Star Is Born," The title doesn't quite fit
","I haven't seen any other versions and had only a vague idea about the story. But it was pretty obvious from the beginning where things were going, making for a rather depressing watch. More so as I found the title kind of misleading. It's not really a story about a star being born. It's the opposite. It's much more about Jack (Bradley Cooper) than it is about Ally (Lady Gaga). His character is the one with a back story and motivations and surprise revelations. Hers never quite gets developed. It didn't help that her initial rise seemed so improbable it felt inauthentic. Her club performance was appropriately amateur and awkward. Then suddenly she is on a huge stage in front of thousands of strangers and she is perfectly fine. Of course, you could say that at the club she was pretending to be someone else while in those performances she was singing her own songs in her own voice and language with her own hair and face. But still, to deliver a flawless duet without so much as a soundcheck, never mind a rehearsal - that's stuff out of fairy tales and this is decidedly not a fairy tale.The movie still works thanks to two ingredients - impeccable acting across the board and the songs. More than anything, the lyrics that vividly express the characters' feelings - something that if spoken, would have sounded cheesy. There's also a wonderful symbolism in the way a song about leaving the shallow and going for the deep becomes 'Shallow' towards the end. I just wish the movie didn't pop to the surface the moment the music would stop playing. I get it that perhaps they didn't want to ruin the poetry by spelling it out, but I wish they found a way to infuse the rest of the movie with more of the depth that was there in the songs.And on a shallow note, I wish they washed Bradley Cooper's hair. It looked gross even when he wasn't supposed to be a dirty mess.",6,0,1,26 December 2018
BlacKkKlansman," Too simplistic. Some really bad dialogue.
","I can't believe this was nominated for an Oscar. And for directing too! Maybe it's a style and I am not understanding it, but many scenes just seemed clunky to me. Acting is kind of meh. And the dialogue is full of cliches or worse - slogans, especially on the clansmen side. It's really unfortunate because it could have been a great story. There really was a young, ambitious (if overconfident) African American cop who on a lark, out of boredom responded to a classified ad from the KKK which lead to an undercover investigation with his white colleague being his face for the Clan. But they made everything too black and white, no pun intended. White people are either extremely racist or anti-racist. I found it simplistic and felt like it glossed over important nuances and sugarcoated things. The racists are total caricatures. I hate to say it, but the rest of the characters are not well developed either.",3,5,10,25 February 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," A movie with a huge heart
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri has a heart. A big one. The film is rough and tough on the outside, but has a soft warm core. Just like its characters. They are all flawed. Some more than others. A lot more. They are all damaged. Some more than others. They all have something they feel guilty about. Some more than others. Some have more reason to than others. But they all care about one another, even if it seems early on that it couldn't be further from the truth. I could feel their hearts ache and it made mine ache too. A sprinkle of humor here and there acts like a good spice - bringing out the flavor of the whole thing. All that makes the movie immensely watchable. It's tragic. It's heartbreaking. Yet, I didn't want it to end.The acting is impeccable. Sam Rockwell may seem to be overdoing it in the beginning but then about half way through you realize that it is intentional.",9,1,4,12 March 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Something's amiss
","When you have someone as unique and talented as Freddy Mercury, an actor as interesting and capable as Rami Malek, songs as powerful as Queen songs, you have a movie right there that is impossible to screw up. But does it achieve more than just not screw up? I am not sure. There's a strong beginning. (A fitting line from the film.) There are many powerful and pognient moments. But something's amiss. At times it felt like it was out of breath. Supporting characters seemed universally flat. With a few exceptions everyone so easily agreed to everything, no matter how outrageous. That felt fake. It's a pretty good film. But it could have been better.",6,2,4,23 November 2018
The Favourite," Spellbinding and alive
","I must admit I was a bit apprehensive about watching this film. After Mary Queen of Scotts I felt no desire to see any more Royals and their Courts with all their scheming and self importance making it impossible to feel for them. But The Favorite proved to be a different kind of a movie. It has a Royal alright, and her Court, and lots and lots of scheming. But the alchemy between acting, direction, and writing conjured up characters that are living, breathing human beings. Every single one of them, even men in those ridiculous wigs and, in case of the character played by Nicholas Holt, ridiculous makeup.But of course, the film belongs to its three female leads. Olivia Coleman plays a heartache of a Queen - increasingly unwell, depressed, and lonely, belittled and down right bullied into believing herself incapable of governing on her own. She is the most sympathetic character in the film, but Coleman makes sure she's not too sympathetic. Sarah (Rachel Weisz) is the Queen's childhood friend as well as her lover. Weisz has perfected playing characters who may or may not be what they seem (Oz The Great And Powerful, My Cousin Rachel). Here she often appears to genuinely care for the Queen. But at other times she acts like a manipulative bully. Is her loyalty really to Queen Anne? Or is she in it for herself and her husband's advantage? Maybe both? And finally Abigail (Emma Stone) - a scrappy little upstart with an almost unbelievable gift for scheming. This one states openly that her loyalty is only to herself. She seems to be a mean creature with no morals, yet I couldn't help feeling sympathy for her. Determined to never go back to what she came from, she is stuck in a permanent survival mode and quite miserable.Add to these three brilliant characters creative use of musical score and editing and the movie is so mesmerizing, I didn't want it to end, and so spellbinding, I didn't care if it took creative liberties with history. I still haven't looked any of it up. Don't want to break the spell.",9,2,7,9 February 2019
Get Out," The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level.
","I am not a fan of horror genre. I don't enjoy being scared. And I am so glad it didn't stop me from seeing Get Out. It's not the kind of horror that makes you afraid of the dark, or of showers, or whatever innocent inanimate objects. The horror is in the meaning. The movie takes common, casual racism and what-ifs it to a whole other level. Plausibility of the horrific things that happen or lack thereof (that can be an undoing of a movie like this for me) is irrelevant here. It's the symbolism that matters. And this symbolism is very subtle, never in your face. The film delivers a message, yet never appears to be trying to say something. The lead and supporting actors are all great, but I want to give special kudos to Marcus Henderson (Walter), Betty Gabriel (Georgina), and Laketh Stanfeld (Andre Logan King). They had the hardest jobs and they were fantastic. The story flows smoothly. There is never a false moment that could throw you out of the movie's hypnotic grip. I thought Chris's mother's death was a bit overexploited, but that is such a small complaint, I wouldn't even count it as one. The film is nothing short of shockingly brilliant.",9,15,29,20 February 2018
A Quiet Place," Clever concept, brilliant acting sabotaged by too many plot holes and inconsistencies
","I don't like being scared. So, as you can imagine, horror is not my favorite genre. A Quiet Place actually helped me understand what makes a horror film tolerable for me. Some of it is good. Some isn't. I'll start with the good. The premise is very clever - a monster with only one sense - hearing. That allowed for some great close encounters. The tools the family uses to protect themselves - from knitted monopoly pieces to fireworks - are also very clever. And logical. I love logic. The family is relatable, their struggle to survive felt real, for the most part. The fact that so much of their survival seems to be owed to having a deaf child gives it a beautiful additional dimension. The acting is brilliant, especially Emily Blunt and the young Millicent Simmonds.But here's the problem. Because I like logic, I can't help noticing when it's missing. And it's distracting. And when it happens too often, as it unfortunately does, it's hard to stay fully engaged. Like, I couldn't quite focus on the wife trying to slip away from under the creature's nose because I was too busy wondering why the crate was open. Things that bring on dire consequences at one point somehow don't cause any trouble at another time. Objects conveniently (or awfully inconveniently) appear in places they have no business being - a bunch of prescription drugs, a nail, a microphone. These are not mere inconsistencies, they drive the plot, which makes them kind of, um, cheats. I also don't understand why a movie with so much innovation had to resort to cliche 'jump' moments - a bloody hand on the shower door, a hand grabbing a wrist. Couldn't he just tap her? I jumped alright. And then I rolled my eyes. All those things were pretty effective in keeping me from getting too scared. But I think I would rather feel scared, than duped.",5,2,3,30 January 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Bewitching, mesmerizing, intoxicating.
","I am a Math major. It is hard to get me out of my head. Near impossible, in fact. Call Me By Your Name achieved just that. I found myself not wanting to, almost unable to think. I just wanted to watch and feel it, breathe it, be mesmerized, bewitched, intoxicated. I loved the peach theme running through the film from Oliver chugging a glass of juice as if it were water to the insanely sensual while barely sexual scene towards the end with feelings of violation and pleasure and disgust and sweetness and so much that cannot be translated into words that Elio might have felt. I loved how there were no close-ups of Olivier early on - we were getting to know him at the same time as other characters were. And how in spite of his brash, borderline rude demeanor half way through the film everyone on screen and me watching fall in love with him. The acting is restrained and real. My only complaint is that Armie Hammer may have been too restrained. I get it, Oliver is used to putting up a front and keeping his emotions tightly wrapped inside, but I felt a little bit of warmth could have gone a long way.",9,2,5,4 February 2018
The Shape of Water," A visual poem I would have liked more if I could stay with it
","Artistically this film is fantastic. Every space is like its own character with its own mood and atmosphere. A lot of it has to do with light, whether it's the dimly lit hallway of Elisa's apartment, her bus rides in the twighlight, or harsh fluorescent lighting of the laboratory. This is the world in which the characters dwell. Outcasts of society - a mute woman, a gay man, an African American woman (to an extent), and a merman like creature - they find friendship and support and love in each other. The movie is a love story and a little bit of a thriller and a visual poem. But I feel that in order to fully appreciate it one needed to be fully immersed, and I kept getting thrown out. One problem was that as a native Russian speaker I found Michael Stuhlbarg's Russian hilarious and thus distracting. I also thought the whole Russian story line was rather wobbly, like it was there just to serve a purpose. Another element that felt contrived was the presence of three scars on Elisa's neck. The explanation they offered accounted for one scar, the other two seemed to be there for the sole purpose of being transformed at the end. The relationship between Elisa and the creature was beautiful, but I had to squash my queasiness when it went sexual. I mean, yes, he was intelligent and sensitive, and could sit at the table like a person eating his beloved eggs, but he wasn't human. Was it really necessary? And lastly, maybe that's just me and my dislike of gore, but was the last scene with the fingers necessary?The ending was really beautiful. I just wish I could stay with the film the whole time.",7,2,3,27 February 2018
Parasite," Felt for everyone except the protagonists
","Parasite starts out with a rather familiar gritty arthouse vibe. Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the 'host' family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone. And that wonderful allegory that existed so naturally in the first half of the movie? Not completely gone in the second, but you have to look for it.",6,3,8,3 February 2020
Black Panther," Visually striking and smart
","The first thing that struck me about Black Panther was visual imagery. From a simple detail like a milk cart for a net on a street basketball court to the way the spectators were placed for the ritual over the waterfall to the pastures and futuristic urban landscape of Wakanda. Then came the questions. Like, if your country is in possession of something valuable that allowed you to make extraordinary progress and give your citizens good lives, do you keep it to yourself or do you help others at a risk of losing it all? The movie answers this in a rather naive, simplistic manner. Well, it kind of had to, being a superhero movie. Just as it had to have all those silly fights and rhino robots. But it also had a villain whose goal is actually quite noble, making things beautifully complicated. And that, along with the actual beauty of which there was so much, made it well worth watching.",7,0,1,9 March 2019
The Greatest Showman," Someone who was a conman and an exploiter is presented as this saintly pioneer of diversity
","It was an enjoyable experience, but they would have been much better off if the character 'loosely based on P. T. Barnum' wasn't named P. T. Barnum. It isn't so much that factually maybe just 10% of it is true, it's that someone who was a conman and an exploiter is presented as this saintly pioneer of diversity. If they didn't insist on tethering the film to real people, it would have looked much more like an entertainment and less like a con. Take Jenny Lindt story. She is presented as an opera singer, which she was in real life, but then she goes on stage and sings what is essentially a show tune. She is there for the sole purpose of demonstrating Barnum's quest for class. Once that's achieved, more or less, they give her a completely ridiculous out. And it happens again and again. Just as I'd get into the mood with a musical number, which are all great, some real life related blunder would throw me off. And the other way around - there would be a nice genuine scene, I even cried once, and an out of place musical number would ruin everything. Circus freaks crashing a high society events? Interracial kiss? On stage? To applause? In mid 19th century? It's hard not to notice that kids don't grow up even though clearly years pass. And some of the adults look way older than plausible from the get go. Hugh Jackman is a great actor and truly a great showman, and it pains me to say this, but when there is Barnum as a young teen and in the next scene he becomes Jackman, coming to take his young wife from her parents' home, I cringed. And it took a while to get over that.",5,2,7,9 January 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Reality was surreal. They just turned the 'sur' up a notch.
","Taika Waititi is a very good actor. Yes, of course, he's a brilliant director of possibly the most creative film of the year. And yes, young Roman Griffin Davis did a remarkable job portraying Jojo's journey and all the emotions he goes through. And Scarlett Johansson was marvelous as his mother trying to balance protecting her last surviving child and doing 'what she can', like hiding a Jewish girl. And Sam Rockwell's Nazi commander drowning his shame in alchohol came across as heartbreakingly human. But if Waititi didn't hit just the right notes as the imaginary Hitler, the entire movie might not have worked. He might have been goofy, hilariously blunt, yet often supportive and encouraging, but he never stopped being Hitler. What this film reflects is the time that seemed surreal. All it really did is turn the 'sur' up a notch. More often than not whatever is funny is also very scary. And tragedy is acutely real. It stays with you.",10,2,3,30 January 2020
Green Book," Quietly magnificent
","Green Book has a lot going for it. A story so incredible, it would be hard to believe if it weren't based on real life. Two fantastic actors Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali giving best performances I've seen from them. (Not that I've seen that much, but I thought the latter was 10 times better here than in Moonlight that got him an Oscar). And Peter Farelli's precise, no frills direction, which I felt was perfect for the story. Parts of it were unavoidably predictable - a black man goes to the deep south in 1962 to perform to all white audiences - bad things are bound to happen. But nearly every predictable episode had a quite unpredictable resolution. And I loved how Tony wasn't just transformed by the extreme racism he witnessed - towards someone he knew and have come to respect, he was also kind of cultured by his overeducated boss. And the fact that Tony was the one who in turn introduced Dr. Shirley, sometimes rather forcefully, to African American music and food was a nice touch.",9,5,11,2 January 2019
