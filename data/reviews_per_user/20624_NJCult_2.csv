The Blair Witch Project," Yeccch
","OHMIGAWD! IT'S SOOO SCARY! Yeah, it's so scary I don't understand why I paid 4.25 (matinee) to see it. There was no suspense, no terror, no dread, no horror (psychological or otherwise). Just lamers wandering around the woods complaining about being lost. The ending of this movie was more of a grand finally than a grand finale. I wasn't scared though in favor for this movie, it gives me a chance to screw with people's heads by driving them through the woods and pretending to break down.",3,1,3,11 August 1999
Dark City," Execrable
","I nearly fell asleep in the theater a quarter of the way through the movie. Dark City was not compelling, the plot was contrived and directed at the moody trenchcoat wearing audience who will gladly eat up anything that is served to them that they can be assured no one else will like.During a second viewing, on video, I remembered the pain I felt while sitting through this movie. I have yet to see what people see in this rubbish that is so gloriously beautiful.The ending was supremely terrible. Look! The lab rat has become powerful like the scientist and now he's going to take over the world (or the maze of rats). Once it became apparent that he was 'special' the movie went from bewildering to predictable.Zero stars out of five stars along with 5 minutes in a closet with Proyas slapping him repeatedly.",1,19,43,25 May 1999
