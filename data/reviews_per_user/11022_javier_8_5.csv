The Equalizer," Ridiculous superhero movie. And I loved it.
","This movie has a generic plot, damsel in distress, the bad guys, the overpowered superhero that can kill anyone in the most stylish and ridiculous ways... but it's entertaining, like if you don't think about the plot too much and you just want to enjoy the good guy punish the bad guys and bring a small piece of justice to the world.Cool slow-motion scenes, cool fight scenes (rid√≠culous, but cool), and Denzel is great at this role. Fun ride.",7,8,12,17 June 2019
Us," Entertaining, but made absolutely no sense.
","I got used to Jordan's 'K&P' sketches always giving you something to think about on race-related subjects. Get Out is also in the same line. I sort of expected something similar with 'Us', but I was largely disappointed. The film made no sense, the plot itself (while misterious) is not engaging enough, and the ending was something like 'Meh, cool, but at this point it doesn't matter really'.
I think he missed a step here. Acting, directing, everything is 10/10, just the plot is ultimately too far fetched and nonsensical. Hope he keeps doing horror movies though!",6,0,0,8 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Good enough (in the context of the worst trilogy).
","I mean, let's face it, this third trilogy was the worst. So in that context, Rise of Skywalker is decent enough. It's entertaining, it brings closure to this trilogy and even Rose has like 60 seconds of total screen time.
Episode 7 was ok I guess, Episode 8 was a train wreck, so to me Episode 9 is a decent star wars movie, not the best of course, it's mainly 'by the book', and fortunately has only a few crazy WTF moments (*minor spoiler* I mean... horses? really? over a star destroyer????) which are not bad enough to ruin the movie, like the Casino subplot on Episode 8.Overall decent, don't expect too much and you'll have a great time, a must see if you've seen the rest of the movies of course, 7/10.",7,3,7,28 December 2019
Bird Box," Long, boring, nothing new.
","The movie is 2 hours long. It focus too much on the characters, and how they survive (which we have seen in TONS of TV Shows and movies about zombies-aliens-monsters apocalypse, so nothing new here). Nothing is ever explained, it's just happening and the ending is dull, disappointing and explains nothing.It's the worst movie I've seen from 2018.",4,2,4,6 January 2019
Jurassic World," AMAZING MOVIE... if you're 10 years old.
","This is clearly a kids movie. It's boring, predictable, by-the-book characters (like the villains are always SO OBVIOUS and so by-the-book it's boring), obvious plot, uninteresting subplots and, of course, CGI dinosaurs. And not that many as you might expect... These movies have nothing new to offer, I'm amazed how this got a 7 on IMDB. Too many ten year olds rating this movie I guess...",4,1,3,4 June 2019
