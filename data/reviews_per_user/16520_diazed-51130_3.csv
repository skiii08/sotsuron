10 Cloverfield Lane," Not as bad
",10 Cloverfield Lane is a simple and suspenseful film that builds interest by not giving too much away at once. from the beginning I started to make guesses and constantly kept changing it and tweaking them. At one point I was 100% sure of something and then completely doubted it. The film focuses on few characters which helps to better show how the relationship between them develops. The mood suddenly changes through out the movie so there are instances where you get the feel that there is no tension and then it abruptly escalates which kept me interested.I was not sure that I would like it at first because it takes place in a bunker and I assumed that it would be boring but it was not as boring.,7,0,0,25 October 2016
Doctor Strange," overall good
","Over all the movie was good, it had some really funny scenes and very good visuals that made it entertaining to watch. The plot was very cliché and the ending lacked some logic. A lot of it was very predictable to the point that you don't have to go to far into the movie to have a solid idea of where it is leading. It played a lot with mysticism, magic, and time making it intriguing and confusing which is OK if you're not paying too much attention, but if you do you might notice that some things contradict and defy the logic that was established previously in the movie. That was one of the issues I had with the ending, which I don't want to spoil. The acting was good and I feel like if I didn't like something about it was probably because of the plot. Although the plot was cliché people never get enough of the story and most movies today rely a lot on the visuals to entertain the audience.",7,2,3,21 November 2016
Saw," worth seeing
","This movie was the bridge for me to other horror films. Unfortunately I watched saw years too late but I did not have to wait for the sequels. The ending of the movie is completely mind blowing. In many other movies of the same genre the ending and plot are very predictable, like someone moving to a new house. The victims is given the opportunity to live, but at a high price and it makes you wonder what you would choose to do, although you don't really want to think about it. It's a really twisted and creepy movie. What I loved about it was the plot twist and mind games that kept me engaged the entire time. The only problems I had with the film was the constant swings from one part of the story to another which can leave you confused and some things are not very realistic, but over all you can either see that as a good thing or a bad one and for me it worked.",9,1,5,25 October 2016
