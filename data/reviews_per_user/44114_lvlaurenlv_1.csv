The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of my new favorites (Maybe spoilers, not sure...)
","I'm only fourteen, still in high school. But I really wanted to see this movie. I finally got around to doing so and I have to say it is one of my new favorites. I struggle with friendships and fall in and out of depression like Charlie. I just feel that this movie just relates to me. I cried the rest of the night because it just hit me. The story is about a freshman who has problems and doesn't have any friends. He finally finds himself among upperclassmen. Him finally fitting in and feeling alive really brings Charlie to life. And I just felt a connection to that. It might just be me, but I absolutely loved this movie. This will be one to go down in the history books for all the misfit toys, including myself. I strongly recommend this movie. I just... can't really put it in words I guess. Everything's perfection. It is how life is for some. Real life; reality. I'm happy a movie finally shows that.",10,1,2,20 November 2013
