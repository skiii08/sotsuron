Your Name.," The most beautiful thing i have ever seen in an animated feature, Stunning.
","So much enticing, so much heart breaking yet so well crafted that this beauty never diminishes till the end. I had not such expectations that this animated feature would tend to be so alluring let alone carving a scar on my heart with such a graceful story line. By the time i was half way through the movie, my world of imagination and consciousness was turned upside down being totally engrossed in this art. Having a fondness towards anime series but an inclination to shun any kind of anime movie, I couldn't be more satisfied and contented with the decision of watching this sensational work of Makoto Shinkai, the writer and director.The way both the characters develop is so brilliantly constructed that it makes you ship for their union irresistibly. The plot was suffice enough for an Oscar nomination but i wonder why it wasn't. If you add up the animations, the plot twist. voice dub, and yes especially the music! The music is everything that makes it so much beyond heart warming. It really suits with the scenario and with the characters as well making it the real beauty that it is.If you are not familiar with animated movies or more precisely to say Japanese anime. This one will certainly get you started. I would definitely rank this as one of the best movies i have ever seen and undoubtedly place this as my best animated movie feature of all time. Definitely a piece to watch.",10,2,5,24 September 2017
