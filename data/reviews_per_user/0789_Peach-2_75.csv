The Devil's Advocate," Thrilling and well done.
","Taylor Hackford has a sure hand as a director and I liked what he did with this story. This film could have just been a rehash of everything else that has ever been made by Hollywood concerning the subject of religon as entertainment. There is a lot of nudity in this picture, but I think it is warranted. I mean the devil deals with matters of the flesh in this film. The nudity, sex and violence are all tastefully done and never exploitive. Al Pacino plays Satan with calm and confidence. Keanu Reeves holds his own with Pacino and puts forth one of his best performances. This film isn't afraid to tackle it's subject head on and I liked that very much.",8,5,9,17 January 1999
The Blair Witch Project," Stunning.
","My intrest in film began in horror movies. More than any other genre, horror movies made me really feel something...real fear. I hadn't seen a really scary movie that stuck with me for a long time, then I heard about this film. No monsters or slashers seen on screen, no moody music, no over abundant amount of gore. I thought to myself this must be some kind of experiment. Being a huge movie buff, I had heard everyone on the net and in magazines talk about how scary this film was for them. So I went to see The Blair Witch Project last night and I was right about the experiment part, this film is an experiment in total fear. The film is shot on what looks like mostly video and is very low budget. I believe however that you will be scared. The film is basically a premise played to the highest degree, a premise that never once let up, not even at the end. I've never really seen a film like this and I advise everyone out there who loves to be scared to go see The Blair Witch Project. The last shot of this film will be stuck in my head for years to come and for the first time in many years I slept with the light on. Can you face your fears?",10,1,2,31 July 1999
The Mask," Good film for Jim Carrey.
","Tis is a great film vehicle for Jim Carrey and a nice little film to boot. Sure it isn't very original, but the special effects help compliment the story and the leads are well cast. Jim Carrey is terrific in 2 roles as the Mask and Stanley Ipkiss. Cameron Diaz, in her first picture, sets the screen on fire as the women of his dreams. The film is a total cliche, but I enjoyed it very much. Oh yeah, the dog was cool too.",7,1,2,19 January 1999
Saturday Night Fever," Dated, but well worth a watch.
","Some people will avoid Saturday Night Fever because it's a 'disco' movie. It couldn't be further from the truth though because this film is about kids and the trouble they sometimes have finding themselves. This film has a great opening shot, showing us where John Travolta's character has his priorities. The friends he hangs with don't really know what they wanna do either and there is a lot of time spent actually avoiding real talk. Sooner or later Travolta's character decides he wants to move on, he meets a girl in the club he hangs out in and Travolta is interested in her because she has left the neighborhood, or is trying, and he is tying to find his escape. Saturday Night Fever gets pretty serious for just a 'disco' movie and there are some good questions made by the screenplay. John Badham does a very good job with the material and this film made John Travolta a star. Some will avoid it.....no one should.",8,0,1,14 March 1999
Alien 3," Under-rated!!
",David Fincher's Alien 3 is a breath-taking feature film debut. Most critics and fans didn't like this Alien movie but I thought it was very well done and beautifully made. The film has a good story and the set design is gorgeous. The performances are all well done and the creature is very spooky once again. David Fincher's film will be appreciated in years to come.,8,3,5,16 November 1998
Antz," Very cool.
",Antz is a very cool film. The animation is very well done and I really enjoyed the characters. In some ways this is Woody Allen's action movie debut. The attention to detail is amazing. This film is much darker than Disney's bug film and in a lot of ways seems made for an older audience. I really liked this film.,9,0,0,3 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hmmm....
","Although I enjoyed The Phantom Menace, I find myself wondering if I was watching the most expensive video game ever made or a great achievement in film-making. I did like the film, but for all that is on the screen, it left me feeling empty. The characters are like action figures in a make believe universe. My young neice could have made the characters more complicated. I am one of the world's largest fans of Star Wars and everything to do with Star Wars. I found myself harkening back to the wonder I felt the first time I saw Star Wars in a movie theater, this film felt empty. Fantastic images, but at the cost of human compassion.",7,0,1,20 May 1999
Se7en," Astounding.
","My favorite thing in film is atmosphere. Once a film has set a tone for its story, I am completely hooked. Seven is a very disturbing film, for some too disturbing. Anyone who has seen Seven though doesn't deny it's ability to leave you with a strange feeling or leave you thinking about it for days afterwards. David Fincher is a very talented director. I thought his Alien 3 film was much more powerful than other people I know and here Fincher shows he has talent. The mood is set from the very beginning, especially the credit sequence. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt become their characters and the film pulls you into its universe. It makes you feel scared, it makes you think. How many films will you see that will make you talk and think in your lifetime. The cinematography by Darius Khondji is amazing and the set design is beautiful. David Fincher has made a very memorable film, one you will never forget.",10,1,1,5 April 1999
Akira," Wow.
","What a vision this animated film has laid out for you the minute you sit down to watch it. Breath-taking visually, ultimately over-long and boring. Great finale!",7,0,3,16 November 1998
As Good as It Gets," Nicholson puts on a clinic.
","Jack Nicholson owns this film from beginning to end. It is a tribute to James Brooks to make us care about the character of Melvin Udall. The movie has great acting all through it. Helen Hunt is fantastic. Greg Kinnear is fantastic. Cuba Gooding Jr., in a small role, is also very good. The movie seems like everybody enjoyed themselves making it. I own the DVD of this film, so I've seen it a few times. Each time I watch Nicholson's performance it seems to get better. In the last 10 years or so, Jack seemed to be running through the paces. Here in this film he does some of the best acting of his career. Brooks has made his best film since Terms Of Endearment.",9,4,5,16 November 1998
12 Monkeys," Gilliam at it again.
","Terry Gilliam is one of the true visionary film-makers working today. Gilliam has a style that is definitely all his own. Usually he writes his own films, this time he directed someone else's screenplay and it is still a Terry Gilliam experience. The film is visually amazing and well casted. The only real weakness is that the film is too long. It slowed down dramatically in parts and seemed incoherent. Great performace by Brad Pitt. Gilliam is up there with the giants of film making.",9,0,0,28 December 1998
Elizabeth," Great film.
","Elizabeth is a great film. It sets its tone early and never lets up. The film is well directed and well acted. The character I can't seem to forget however is Walsingham. Geoffery Rush portrays Walsingham as a quiet and menacing soul. I simply loved his performance, as well as Cate Blanchett. This film runs a little on the long side but you will never forget Rush's character. Great film.",9,0,0,13 May 1999
Blade," Awesome!!!!
","Blade is a great movie. This film has so much energy that even I'm ready to go hunting vampires. For a film geek like myself, this film has it all. Wesley Snipes can finally have an action franchise and Stephen Norrington will be working in Hollywood for awhile. The screenplay is great, the cinematography is great, and the editing is awesome. The special effects are in a world of their own. This is one of th most thought out comic book based films you will ever see and it has a great cast. It's good to see Kris Kristofferson and Udo Kier. The only weak point in the whole film is the performance of Stephen Dorff. Dorff's character, Deacon Frost, seems rather weak for Blade. Can't wait for a sequel!!!!",10,42,73,29 December 1998
The Mummy," Cool.
","The Mummy is an overblown, big budget B-movie. It is an exciting piece of entertainment. Brendan Fraser is solid in the lead role with the right amount of comedy and seriousness. Vosloo was very spooky as the Mummy, showing that he has the natural ability to play a heavy in a movie. The direction from Stephen Sommers was pretty tight all around, the film did linger from time to time, but overall was always interesting. My favorite part of the film however was the special effects. The effects were close to seamless and I really enjoyed the Mummy effects. This was a very cool flick.",8,0,0,6 June 1999
The Natural," Surrealistic.
","The Natural is a very un-natural baseball film. It seems more a myth of great baseball players and the sometimes super human things that can be accomplished on the baseball field. Robert Redford is very good in the film and the rest of the cast was chosen well. I especially liked Richard Farnsworth and Wilford Brimley. The film isn't a true story, but treats itself with the respect of a great biography. Some will like it, others will be appalled by it. Either way, Randy Newman's score and Caleb Deschanel's cinematography are a good reason to tune in and enjoy this one of a kind baseball picture.",8,8,14,9 January 1999
Dead Poets Society," A truly inspiring film.
",Dead Poets Society is a truly inspiring piece of film-making. Robin Wiliiams is great in this one and the rest of the cast are good as well. Great direction from Peter Weir and great cinematography by John Seale.,8,0,1,23 November 1998
Home Alone," Good family film.
","Home Alone is a good family film. I enjoyed it. I saw the film with about 500 young children and it was an overwhelming experience. Although I didn't think the film was as funny as they did, I had a great time listening to them laugh. Kids will laugh more than adults will, but I think that's what this film is aiming to do.",8,4,5,20 December 1998
The Doors," What a ride.
","Oliver Stone's film, The Doors, is a visual delight. Stone has taken the music of The Doors and made this film as a homage to one of the great rock performers. Val Kilmer's performance as Jim Morrison will not be forgotten. He captures the role in every frame of the movie. The whole cast is well thought out as a matter of fact and Stone uses them wisely. Olver Stone is one of our great film-makers and this film will be appreciated in years to come as a staple of the rock-n-roll movie.",9,3,3,27 November 1998
Taxi Driver," Powerful.
","Taxi Driver is the perfect cinematic example of a lonely soul. Travis Bickle is so alone it drives him crazy. Bickle tries to understand everything, but can't figure out anything because his judgement is so completely blurred. Bickle's idea of a date is dinner and a porno film. Robert De Niro turns in one of the greatest performances of his career and Martin Scorsese is at the top of his form. Paul Schrader's script is deep with character development in the right areas. I find the most interesting aspect of Taxi Driver is the Bickle characters obsession with the women in is life. Cybill Shepard plays the Madonna and Jodie Foster is the underaged whore. It seems like Bickle treats each woman as the other, showing just how complicated Bickle has become in his self pity and loneliness. All this frustration causes Bickle to comprehend an act of violence, his first attempt, he chickens out. Then out of more anger because the first act of violence didn't pan out, the second attempt at violence is extreme and insane. Scorsese, De Niro and Schrader have created one of the most interesting and complicated films in cinema history. One of the great films.",10,0,0,7 September 1999
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick is genius.
","Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master.",10,289,396,10 December 1998
Fargo," The best Coen brothers yet.
",Fargo is the best film from the Coen brothers yet. This movie is perfect. The cast is great and the direction is outstanding. The script is well thought out and the cinematography from Roger Deakins is brilliant. I would also like to comment on the score from Carter Burwell and say that it is his best to date. There is not a wasted frame in this film. One of the best films I have ever seen period.,10,1,3,29 November 1998
Predator," Short and solid.
","Predator is so much fun to watch that I forgot all about it being an Arnie movie. It has suspense, terror, gore. a little humor and an amazing creature that will blow you away. John McTiernan does a terrific job and Arnold was very solid. Check Predator out and you'll be very happy that you did because this picture rocks!!!",8,0,0,26 October 1998
Notting Hill," Great film.
","I absolutely loved Notting Hill. It made me feel good the way a romantic comedy should make you feel and the performances were outstanding. There really isn't anything bad about this film at all. The soundtrack is perfect, the cinematography is beautiful, the editing is well done. It's as close to perfect as you can really get, I just wish they could have explored the background characters a little more. I enjoyed Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts performances so much however that I can forget about those background characters very easily. My favorite sequence in the entire film is when Hugh Grant is walking through Portebello Road and the seasons are changing. The way the film shows time passing is very creative and there is another great shot involving a huge crane, that's just great film-making. If you can't watch this film and smile, you should have your head checked.",9,0,1,27 January 2000
American Pie," Funny.
","American Pie will no doubt shock some people and make others laugh all night long. If you are a fan of Dumb And Dumber or Kingpin, you will definitely like this film. The film is about a group of young teenage boys trying to lose their virginity. It reminded me of the hgh school films I used to watch when I was growing up and sneaking into the living room to watch movies on cable late at night. My parents would be fast asleep in their room and my brother was too young to care, it was just me and a dirty movie about high school or a private boarding school. Those were the days. This film is very funny and full of sexual overtones, I definitely enjoyed American Pie.",8,0,0,27 January 2000
Grease," Greatest musical ever!!
","I am a huge fan of Grease. I've seen the play and I've watched the movie at least 500 times. It captures everything high school is about. Even though it is set in the 50's, it seems to resonate even for today's generation. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John are great in the movie as well as the rest of the cast. I met the girl of my dreams when I took her on a date to see the play, so this film has a special place in my heart.",10,49,81,15 December 1998
The Color of Money," Scorsese's sequel, not the original.
","Martin Scorsese's sequel to The Hustler is at times entertaining, at times stylish, and at times boring. The movie starts out well and then wanders into nowhere land. The score to the film is good, the editing and cinematography are nice also. I just wish Scorsese would have made an original film instead of a sequel to a great film. Paul Newman is great in this movie and Tom Cruise can hold his own along the great Newman. The movie just turns boring then seems to last forever. I will say that the scenes with the billiard balls on the tables are fantastic.",7,1,2,23 November 1998
The Thing," Great flick.
","I've watched this film countless times and it never bores me. This film sets up atmosphere from the very start and never lets up. Kurt Russell is great in the lead role and the rest of the cast is perfect. John Carpenter uses lighting and music to develop nice moods and textures. I've seen this film at least 100 times, it isn't perfect in some ways, but I've neverminded that at all. It's a pure horror film with great special effects from Rob Bottin and great lighting by Dean Cundey. I think Carpenter should get back to this type of horror film, it really is his strength as a director.",10,0,1,3 October 1999
Armageddon," Very little to enjoy.
","Armageddon is one of the worst movies Hollywood has made in awhile. It is also one of the loudest. Usually I wouldn't complain about great sound for a film, but this one has more sounds and effects than story. There is too much talent involved for this movie to be as bad as it ended up. Let me also say that I'm very tired of Hollywood's recent fascination with disaster movies. Maybe the disaster that this one became will make them think about a better story next time.",5,0,1,22 November 1998
The Shining," The Master.
","As I write these comments about The Shining, I write them with the knowledge that this films director, Stanley Kubrick, passed away earlier this year. It is a shame that we will only get one more film from this cinematic genius, but at least we get one more. The Shining is one of the great horror films of all time and my personal favorite. This movie has so much atmosphere that you feel like your inside the hotel with the characters. The set design is amazing and the opening helicopter shot is unforgettable. The score to this film, by Bela Bartok, is simply hypnotic. There is also great cinematography from John Alcott. Kubricks' films are always hard to forget, but this film also has a hard to forget performance from Jack Nicholson. Nicholson holds the picture together in a lot of respects, as he goes crazy, the audience begins to see his dementia as well. I've heard Stephen King didn't really like this version of his novel. I think that is a shame because Kubricks' films are like novels in many ways. This film, like so many of Kubricks' films, is a masterpiece.",10,1,2,7 June 1999
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Big time action.
","This is an ACTION movie. It never really lets up, except for some narrative that has to be explained. I saw this film right when I got out of high school and it blew me away. I like the choice of cinematography, it all seems to be a cold blue color. Very interesting. I have a friend who has seen this film so many times that I can't even count. I think he's addicted to James Cameron. I didn't like this Terminator flick as much as the first but, oh well, it still rocks!!!",Null,0,0,8 September 1999
Apocalypse Now," What a great film.
","Francis Ford Coppola took on a great task in making this film and we are all very lucky that he decided to do it. Many have said that The Godfather is his masterpiece and that may be true. No film, however, is closer to his heart than Apocalypse Now. This movie is a feast for the eyes, imagination and mind. The casting is great. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous by Vittorio Storaro. Many have said that Coppola was a mad genius during the making of this film, that he went overboard in every respect. I don't understand what's wrong with that considering that this is a man that believes in his art. The film is a journey into the darkest recesses of the mind and Coppola went into it headfirst. The film is a feast for any film fan.",10,0,0,16 November 1998
Edward Scissorhands," A Tim Burton film.
","Only Tim Burton could take a character like Edward Scissorhands and make you care about everythng that happens to him. The set design on this film is great, it seems to be making a comment on the bland lifestyle of suburbanites. The houses being one solid color is a nice touch. Edward Scissorhands, as played by Johnny Depp, is an innocent and naive fellow who gets thrust into this crazy suburban nightmare. Tim Burton shows us that he believes the people in town are crazier than a strange lonely character at the top of a hill. If you have ever read interviews with Burton, you will see that this is his favorite type of story to work in. Burton seems to love the characters who nobody else would understand. The cast is solid, and I particularly liked seeing Vincent Price and Alan Arkin. The score from Danny Elfman is his best to date and totally captures the feel of this film. Edward Scissorhands is one of the most original characters in cinema history and Burton does a great job of making this character memorable.",9,0,0,29 November 1998
Dark City," A film that will be remembered for years.
","Dark City will be remembered in years to come as a true masterpiece of film-making. It will be along side such films as Blade Runner and Metropolis as statements to the genre. The director, Alex Proyas, could be the next great director of our time. The visuals and set designs in this film can hardly be rivaled by any other film out there. It is simply a beautiful film to look at and admire. The script is tight. I've heard people complain that the film is confusing or weird, but I found it very easy to follow. This movie hypnotized me from the very first frames to the very last. The performances are all top notch and the cinematography is visually stunning. The music from Trevor Jones is perfect for this film. Alex Proyas has only made two films that I know of, and both of them have visuals that stick with you for months afterwards. He has the eye of a great director and reminds me of Kubrick. We could be witnessing the next great director of a future generation. Great film.",10,0,2,23 November 1998
Legends of the Fall," Melodramatic.
","Legends Of The Fall is a very melodramatic film. The story is so unreal in its sadness that it becomes a game of one-upmanship to see which character suffers a worst fate. Definitely a beautiful film to look at, but a very sad one to sit through.",7,2,5,3 January 1999
The Princess Bride," Inconceivable!!!
","The Princess Bride is a very beautiful and romantic film. It is also filled with humor, which will make it a cult classic for years to come. Rob Reiner has created his most brilliant film here and the cast is awesome. For anyone to deny liking this film, there has to be something wrong with their imagination. If you don't understand the film, I have only one word for you. INCONCEIVABLE!!!!!",10,1,2,23 January 1999
Velvet Goldmine," Interesting.
",I really wanted to like this film. It had a great set-up and a great story idea. The attention to detail was very good and the music was pretty good as well. The part that let me down was that the reporter never found Brian Slade. I wanted to hear more about this character from the character himself. It just never lived up to that premise of a fallen legend. Ewan MacGregor is very good in this film and he's the main reason to see it.,6,1,2,21 May 1999
Good Will Hunting," Solid.
","Good Will Hunting is a very solid and quiet film. I just finished watching it for the second time on DVD and was more impressed by the screenplay than I was the first time. I thought the first time I saw the film it was only Van Sant's direction that held it all together. The movie is just well written and well directed. I think the casting was good, although I don't think Ben Affleck does a very god job in this film. Robin Williams deserved his Oscar, although a big part of me still thinks it belonged to Robert Forster for Jackie Brown. Matt Damon is very good in the lead role. I particularly like the scene toward the end when Matt and Robin's character's open up. The emotion is overwhelming and that is some great acting. The rest of the cast is good too, and Gus Van Sant's direction is powerful. Great movie.",9,15,32,27 December 1998
Casualties of War," De Palma on top of his game.
","Casualties Of War is a great Brian De Palma film. Sure it's not his best work but it is intense and suspenseful storytelling. The cast is good. Michael J. Fox was a surprise to say the least in this movie. I didn't think he would hold his own with Sean Penn. Fox more than holds his own, I believe he overshadows Penn. This would not be the case if Sean Penn wasn't overacting so much. He is all over the place with his character. De Palma continues to be one of the great stylist of modern cinema.",8,16,25,21 November 1998
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Magical animation.
","Magical animation and pure imagination pretty much sum up Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. I've never seen stop-motion photography like this before. The film is simply a marvel to the human eye. The score by Danny Elfman is amazing and is the most beautiful component of this film. Since nobody makes musicals anymore, it's always nice to sit thru a well made animated picture because it harkens back to old Hollywood musicals. Danny Elfman is one of the most brilliant composers working in film today and this just might be his masterwork. What a pure and magical film.",10,1,2,11 January 1999
The Evil Dead," The joys of low-budget film-making.
","There is a complete innocence in the wicked ways of The Evil Dead. The film is made to scare and disgust you and achieves some of those things, other things seem long and drawn out. Sam Raimi has alot of great originality behind the camera. Some of the point-of-view shots of the evil in the forest are some of the most interesting shots you will ever see in a film. This film is a prime example of a low-budget causing the filmmakers to become more creative. The acting in this film is very stiff, the directing and camera work however are very interesting and creative. The Evil Dead is one of the most original horror films you'll ever see and there are still two sequels to watch that are classics.",8,1,2,28 April 1999
From Dusk Till Dawn," Drive-in theater!!
","From Dusk Till Dawn isn't a great movie but it is a great movie for film geeks that love drive-in horror/action films. The casting was well done and the screenplay is good. It just seems that Tarantino and Rodriguez had so much fun making this movie that they just took the concept and ran with it. I enjoyed this movie because I am a film geek, but I think other people will think it childish and badly put together.",9,0,0,10 December 1998
A Bug's Life," Wow.
","There is great detail in A Bug's Life. Everything is covered. The film looks great and the animation is sometimes jaw-dropping. The film isn't too terribly orignal, it's basically a modern take on Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, only with bugs. I enjoyed the character interaction however and the bad guys in this film actually seemed bad. It seems that Disney usually makes their bad guys carbon copy cut-outs. The grasshoppers are menacing and Hopper, the lead bad guy, was a brillant creation. Check this one out.",8,52,60,13 May 1999
For Love of the Game," Baseball....movies....cool.
","Although I didn't like For Love Of The Game the way I liked Bull Durham or Field Of Dreams, it's still a very entertaining film. Directed by Sam Raimi in a very subtle style, this is Costner's best film since Tin Cup. Raimi only shows flashes of his visual theatrics, Costner is very solid and I liked Kelly Preston very much. The way the story is told in the film is very fresh for a baseball movie and this is the high point for me. Baseball is just the background to a very touching love story. I hope this film more than anything else shows Hollywood that Sam Raimi is one of or greatest talents behind the camera.",9,9,17,9 April 2000
Major League," One of the funniest baseball movies I've ever seen.
","Major League is definitely one of the funniest baseball movies I have ever seen. The only thing I didn't like about it is that I'm a life-long Yankee fan. They make the Yankee's out to be such jerks in this film, how could you not root for the Indians. The casting is excellent and there are some truly great moments in this film. It suffers from a Cinderella type storyline, but that is the only true weakness.",8,0,4,6 January 1999
The Graduate," Great movie.
","The Graduate is a very good movie. I really don't have much else to say, just trust me when I say 'check it out.'",8,2,8,15 December 1998
Toy Story 2," A very funny film.
","The amount of detail that Pixar studios puts into their films is really amazing. The reflections and the shadows on characters and surfaces alike is really cool. Toy Story 2 is just as good as the first Toy Story, in some ways even better. It seems the film is more comfortable with its characters and the humor doesn't seemed forced at all. I can't imagine a better film for small children to see and adults as well. I have alot of friends who won't watch animated films because they are made for children. I think that my 'grown-up' friends should stop thinking these films are for children and start realizing how great animation can make you feel.",9,0,1,6 February 2000
There's Something About Mary," Funny and tasteless.
","The Farrelley Brothers love tasteless humor, there is no doubt about that. This film is very funny and manages to inject a sweet little romance between Ben Stiller and Cameron Diaz. There is some humor at the expense of the mentally challenged that may bother some people, but it is just tasteless humor and I think if you go into this film knowing the same guys brought you Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin, you'll get exactly the movie you expect. One more thing, how about the performance from Matt Dillon? This is quite a departure for him and in a weird way he had me laughing more than anyone else in the movie. Little long, but close to perfect.",8,0,0,14 February 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," A last tip of the hat to the master.
","Stanley Kubrick's last film, Eyes Wide Shut, is simply one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Although the film was in production and shooting for well over two years, the wait has been more than worth it. The master of cinematic atmosphere, Kubrick explores jealousy and sex in Eyes Wide Shut. I have heard that there is both a R-rated and NC-17 rated version, either way the version I saw was powerful and hypnotic. The imagery in this film will be with you for a long time after viewing, and the score is very eerie. Kubrick knows more than any other director how to manipulate an audience, his films are always thought provoking and this film is no exception. The underground sex party is one of the strangest cinematic experiences I have had the pleasure to witness in a very long time. Kubrick was the greatest director ever and this film shows he was never afraid to explore the dark side of the human race. The best film of the decade. You will be missed Mr. Kubrick.",10,0,1,18 July 1999
Detroit Rock City," There's a better film here.
","Detroit Rock City seems like it is totally incomplete. The film never gets rolling in the right direction.The comedy isn't very funny and the characters you never really care for at all. I think that the characters should have at least met their idols, instead they just make it to the concert and that's the end of the story. I wish they could have went into more detail about Mystery, the band that the main characters play in and perform in their basement. It would have been interesting, more so than watching four characters do really crazy and stupid things just to get a ticket. There's a better film here.",5,2,5,27 January 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Ritchie is a film fan.
","The director of this film, Guy Ritchie, must be a very big fan of film. All the tricks in making a film are evident throughout this picture. Slow motion, quick cuts, strange camera angles, you name it and it's here. There's nothing wrong with that at all. I enjoyed the film although it was nothing I hadn't seen before in other films. I liked the characters, especially Big Chris, and I liked the locations. The film has a very English feel all around it, but it feels more like an English film wanting to be American. I'm sure Guy Ritchie will get work here in the States, hope his next film is better.",8,0,0,15 September 1999
Die Hard," The most influential action film in the modern decade.
","Die Hard is the most influential action movie of the last 10 tears. Without a doubt this movie has been ripped of more than any action movie in the modern era. When I first saw this film it was so cool that I immediately hit the rewind button and told my brother to come in the room and watch with me again. This move is very cool. I don't think Bruce Willis has made a better action movie since, except the other Die Hard films. John McTiernan is one of the best action directors around and this movie made him a Hollywood name. Great movie.",9,0,0,24 November 1998
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Beautiful to behold.
","Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula is a beautifully realized film. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is like looking at a gothic painting. The set design is brillant and the score by Wojciech Kilar is great. Coppola must have found some of that old energy to bring this one to the screen. A lot of work has gone into this picture and it shows on every frame. The cast is good. There are stand out performances by Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder and Sir Anthony Hopkins. There is one bad flaw in the casting however and that is Keanu Reeves. Reeves is normally a good actor, but he is plain terrible in this one. I can't believe Coppola let that performance get by and onto the screen. The movie is a little overlong, but it was a treat to see one of cinema's masters at work.",8,0,1,17 November 1998
Kingpin," A very funny film.
","Kingpin is a very funny film. Although it leans toward very tasteless humor, I don't think anybody could watch this one without laughing out loud. The humor is way over the top and this has to be one of Bill Murray's best performances. Great movie.",10,1,3,28 December 1998
The Waterboy," Just plain dumb.
","The Waterboy is just a plain silly and dumb movie. This movie made a lot of money, although I don't see how because it seems aimed at children. Now I know a lot of people liked this film, I had friends that told me it was the funniest Adam Sandler movie yet. I'm left wondering what they saw in this film at all. I love idiotic humor, this film just seemed childish to me. I can understand a kid liking it or maybe an adult if you could give me a good reason, but this film didn't make me laugh at all. Sorry if I make anyone upset but there are better movies to waste your time.",2,2,3,5 April 1999
Stalag 17," 'Guy' movie?
","I've heard the term 'Guy Movie' many times in my life. The other day someone I know told me that Stalag 17 was a total 'Guy Movie.' Now, I really like this film alot, I like it for it's male camaraderie and I like it for it's storytelling. The thing I like most about Stalag 17 is William Holden, who has to be the most under-rated actor of the golden age of Hollywood. Holden is dead on in this film, never once letting you think he could be the informant or not. There is an awful lot of comedy in this film, most at the expense of Shapiro and the Animal, alot of it aimed at the Russian camp across the compound where they hold the female prisoners. My biggest complaint isn't the comedy from the prisoners, it's the buffoonish way the German guards are portrayed. Maybe this is a 'Guy Movie.' Either way, I really enjoyed the film. But does anybody really think the Germans were that goofy?",9,3,6,31 July 1999
The Cannonball Run," What is this exactly?
","I believe I liked the Cannonball Run movies when I was younger because of the car stunts. There's no other reason to like this movie. The chemistry between Reynolds and DeLuise is good, it also has Jackie Chan,but why an adult would be entertained I have no idea.",5,2,6,18 November 1998
Platoon," Oliver Stone's masterwork.
","Oliver Stone's true passion as a film-maker comes to the screen in vivid life in his biographical film, Platoon. This was one of the most captivating experiences I've ever had while watching a film and I still watch this at least once a year. The cast is perfect. Charlie Sheen has never been better, Tom Berenger is hypnotizing and very scary as Barnes. Willem DaFoe plays Elias as a mentor and guide to life for Charlie Sheen's character. There are similarities between Elias and Jesus Christ, especially when Elias is killed. He dies with his arms outstretched, as if to say he sacrificed himself for his men. Stone's film never misses a beat and proves that he is a film genius.",10,1,1,21 January 1999
Scream," Dedication.
","Horror movies come and go in terms of popularity with the public. When Scream came out in movie theaters, no one was seeing horror films. This movie hit the nerve to get horror films back on track as one of the great reasons to go to the movies in the first place....to be scared. It's fitting to let Wes Craven direct this film, it's basically an dedication movie to all the great slasher films of the 80's. The first 15 minutes of this film are amazing, the rest is tight, it just never holds up to those 15 minutes. The film is well casted and well written and there are a lot of great moments for horror movie buffs. Wes Craven has had a long career in horror films and he deserves a big hit such as this film. Congratulations on scaring us again, Mr. Craven.",8,0,0,3 April 1999
Halloween," John Carpenter's masterpiece.
",Halloween set the standard for a whole generation of horror films. It certainly was the most influential film since Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Carpenter created atmosphere with this film and to me atmosphere can tell a story all on its own. Jamie Lee Curtis is effective in the lead role. I just like the way the film is shot by the great cinematographer Dean Cundey. There are truly some shots that will stick with you for a long time after this film is over. The best horror film of the last 20 years without a doubt.,10,0,0,15 December 1998
Carrie," De Palma at his best.
","Brian De Palma is the true voyeur of film-makers. You don't really watch a De Palma film as much as it seems he's letting you take a peek. Carrie is one of his early masterpieces and it doesn't disappoint. Great film, great editing, great cinematography and great score.",8,0,0,18 November 1998
Blow," The culmination of modern cinema...
","It has been a very long time since I have sit down to write a review for a film in the IMDB. It's a practice I am happy to resume with a film that I believe is definitely a must-see movie. I gave the film a 9 on the voting scale, not a 10 only because of some weak acting in spots. Maybe it was some of the old age makeup on Johnny Depp, but at any rate the film is very good. Depp is probably the best actor of his generation and he doesn't step wrong in this film. Ray Liotta is very solid in a role that reminded me of Corrina,Corrina for some reason. I also want to add that it is a very huge pleasure to see Paul Reubens back on the big screen. Forget Pee Wee Herman or don't forget him, welcome back Paul. I started feeling sorry for the guy Johnny Depp portrays in this film, that has to be the convincing nature of acting because the man George Jung is probably a real scumbag in some ways. Although every American has a right to pursue the American dream, it's just that George Jung pursued his in Colombia. I believe more now than ever before that Ted Demme has arrived as a director. There is true inspiration in his directorial style and his choice of shot selection. I will always be one of the biggest fans of The Ref, but as of this film, Ted Demme is here people. Take notice. Some reviews I've read have compared this film to Boogie Nights and Goodfellas as if it's a terrible rip-off of those pictures. All I can say is, if your gonna rip-off any movie, why not Goodfellas or Boogie Nights?",9,0,0,8 April 2001
The Silence of the Lambs," Great film.
","I am not the world's biggest Jonathan Demme fan. I have to admit however that The Silence Of The Lambs is a great foray into film-making. Demme's use of close-ups are there to put you in the face of the horror that is serial killing. Hopkins performance is a stand-out one, although I didn't care for Jodie Foster's performance much at all. Foster's southern accent sounded forced and slurry. This film is tight though and at 118 minutes it never seems to be long or drawn out. There are many scenes in this film you will never forget and many more that you will try to forget for a lifetime.",10,2,3,8 June 1999
Speed," Fast paced.
","Speed is a film where the title says everything about the film itself. This movie is fast. The action sequences are fast, the dialog is fast, the editing etc. I really enjoyed this film the first time I saw it. I don't believe it has much rewatchable value. Keanu Reeves is very solid in the lead role and Sandra Bullock is endearing and sweet in her supporting role. Dennis Hopper plays the main bad guy and it's pretty much like all Dennis Hopper bad guy roles. This film just flies by and never loses the momentum it builds. Good movie.",8,0,0,23 June 1999
The Sixth Sense," Great Twist.
","Every now and then a film comes along and really surprises you with its power. The Sixth Sense is such a film. I followed this film very carefully and still didn't see the ending that was heading my way. My jaw literally dropped to the ground and I had to wipe my chin of all the sticky cola product syrup. Bruce Willis is very subtle in the film and the young boy is very sweet. The credit really goes to the director, he sets up atmosphere and mood and does a very nice job. I really liked the cinematography and the production design as well. Do yourself a favor and get up off your butt and go see this film.",8,0,0,19 October 1999
A Nightmare on Elm Street," One of the best horror films ever made.
",Wes Craven's A Nightmare On Elm Street is one of the classic horror films of the modern cinema. It's a very creative film with some awesome visuals and knockdown scares. The first film is still the best film in this series because it takes the Freddy myth seriously and doesn't treat it like a comedy routine. Robert Englund is lucky to have landed the role of a lifetime in Freddy Krueger and you can tell he relishes the part. The direction by Wes Craven is some of his best work and the cinematography by Jacques Haitkin is amazing. The entire film is well cast and Freddy is a great modern urban legend. One of the best horror films you will ever see.,10,0,0,14 January 1999
The Truman Show," Surreal.
","All I have to say about this film is 'WOW!' I went into this movie hearing a lot of people say that it wasn't any good. The movie is a surreal fantasy and it sets itself up from the very beginning. Those of you who have read my comments on IMDB before know that my favorite thing in a film is atmosphere. This film has a great atmosphere from the very beginning and never lets up. I had heard many different things about Jim Carrey's performance. All I can say is that this is the best performance of his career so far and shows that he is much more than just a great slapstick actor. Peter Weir has done an excellent job with this film and Andrew Niccol's screenplay is amazing. Don't go into this film looking for Ace Ventura or Dumb and Dumber, you'll only be let down. This is a totally original film and a brilliant exhibition of the films Hollywood should make more often.",10,0,0,3 February 1999
Heat," Great cops and robbers story.
","I loved Heat. It was a very stylistic cowboy flick set in Los Angeles. Michael Mann's direction and script were solid. The cast is phenomenal. De Niro and Pacino are great, but I wonder why only the one scene together. Watching two of the greatest actors in cinema history chase each other around was awesome. Great movie.",10,0,0,19 December 1998
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Classic.
","When I started putting my comments on the IMDb, I just wanted to share with other movie fans my love for the celluoid image. I told myself I wouldn't comment on the great films because I figured evrything was already said about those films. After seeing The Phantom Menace though I realized what a real masterpiece of film making the original Star Wars has become in my eyes. The feelings I have for these characters is one of complete love and affection. You can't watch Star Wars and not care about the main characters in the film. When Obi-Wan sacrfices himself it is still gut wrenching and more effective than 45 minutes of The Phantom Menace. It is true when Star Wars hit the screen in 1977 it changed movies forever. Only a handful of films will ever achieve that amazing feat.",10,0,0,30 August 1999
The Great Escape," The greatest of escapes.
","The Great Escape is THE prison escape movie. The film is rich with characters and the direction by John Sturges is great. Steve McQueen is the man and the rest of the cast are terrific. This movie is heroic and shows the bravery of men in the second world war. I escape into this movie whenever I feel really down, it's a great spirit lifter and one of the greatest films of all time.",10,82,120,15 December 1998
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A comedy landmark!!!
",Truly one of the greatest films of the 70's and beyond. Hardly ever have I laughed as much as I did watching this one. There are many sequences in the Holy Grail that stick out as unforgettable. The killer rabbit is one of the most absurd things I've ever seen and the debate on the witch is Monty Python at its best. The greatest comedy team of all time is Monty Python and if you watch this film you'll know why. RUNAWAY!!!!!!!!!,10,0,0,6 January 1999
Contact," Short and sweet.
","I could write a whole essay on the subjects of this film, so I'll keep it short. Check this one out for sure, you will not be disappointed at all.",9,0,2,23 November 1998
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Spellbinding and magical.
","Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade starts with a great opening scene and never lets up afterwards. River Phoenix is cast as the young Indy and he does a terrific job. There's a great chase on the top of a train and a neat little reminder of how Indy received that scar on his chin. The opening, however, is just the start of a fantastic journey that involves Nazi's, a dogfight with fighter planes, and a well done journey into the lair of the Holy Grail. The screenplay, written by Jeffrey Boam, is terrific. It has the right amount of comedy one-liners and adventure to hold your attention for 2 hours. I have to comment on this character of Indiana Jones again. Harrison Ford plays this character so perfectly that he almost made me forget Han Solo and George Lucas has created one of the most memorable characters in the modern cinema. Steven Spielberg seems very comfortable with the character and the stories. I'm hoping for a new Indiana Jones picture soon.",9,3,5,26 October 1998
Goodfellas," Scorsese's greatest film.
","I believe that Goodfellas is Martin Scorsese's greatest film. This movie is a film fan's dream come true. The acting is brillant. Ray Liotta is terrific as Henry Hill and Robert De Niro is great as Jimmy The Saint. Joe Pesci deserved his Oscar for a brillant and terrifying performance. Scorsese is the greatest film-maker of his generation and he has made alot of great films. Goodfellas tops them all. The way the camera moves, the way the narration grabs you and pulls you in and the characters themselves, top notch film-making at it's best. I loved this movie from the first minute to the last. I especially loved the ending where Liotta is running around doing his errands and snorting cocaine the whole time. Scorsese injects into his film style the paranoia that Liotta's character is feeling. In the process making our heart race at the same time. This is a great film and it is highly recommended.",10,0,0,15 December 1998
Beetlejuice," Tim Burton is awesome!
","Tim Burton's Beetlejuice is a great film. The director was given free reign to make his own film visually and it is great. The casting is good, but the standout is Michael Keaton. Keaton is absolutely hilarious in the title role. This movie is very funny and well done.",8,51,88,17 November 1998
Evil Dead II," A blast to watch.
","There is no real critical comment to make about this film. It basically comes down to this, if you like great B-horror films, this one should be at the top of your list. I had so much fun watching this movie that I must have watched it 100 times since. Highly recommended.",10,2,3,29 November 1998
