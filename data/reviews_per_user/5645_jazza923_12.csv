Walk the Line," Walk the Line
","Great film. What makes it is Jaoquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon's performances. Wow, absolutely amazing. They really put their hearts and souls into the roles, without them it could not have worked. Joaquin Phoenix in particular. He delved into the character so deeply. As a story, a dynamic first half. It falls into a slump midway and picks up toward the end. Excellent period detail. The direction was fine. Great music.Again, amazing performances from Jaoquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon. They certainly deserved their Oscar nominations. And since this site ridiculously requires a certain amount of lines I will ramble on. A film can easily be summed up in three lines. It is called basic and to the point.",8,0,0,23 February 2006
Gremlins," Gremlins (1984)
","I never cared for this as much as most, even in 1984 I thought the special effects were a little cheesy and that the gremlins looked like stuffed animals, not real living things. It's a good thing that it doesn't take itself seriously. It is so predictable, the minute you hear the warnings of gremlins not liking light, not to feed them after midnight and never ever expose them to water, you just KNOW all those things are going to happen. Also, you know the something is going to happen to the evil Polly Holliday character, so it is rather clichéd in that way. On the plus side, there is some originality and creativity. There are some very funny scenes as well.",6,1,2,31 March 2010
Shutter Island," Good, but not Scorsese at his best.
","The cinematography is very impressive and the supporting cast is exceptionally good. Patricia Clarkson and Mark Ruffalo stand out. Ben Kingsley's role is very stereotypically him, perhaps a little offbeat casting would have made the role more interesting. Very well produced in all areas, and the attention to period detail is exceptionally well done. But I have to agree with the critics on this one, although it is good, it is not up with most Scorsese films, it is distant emotionally and has one too many dream fantasy sequences for it's own good. The two hour and eighteen minute length is a bit excessive and unnecessary. Still, along the way there is much to entertain.",6,1,3,9 June 2010
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Brilliant silent film...
","100/100. A brilliant, absolutely brilliant film. Breathtaking, with amazing performances from everyone in the cast. One of the greatest silent films ever made and among the greatest films of all time. Moving, unforgettable, and Maria Falconetti is mesmerizing. She is incredible, and lights up the screen in every frame. This is a must see film for anyone seriously interested in film and film history. Visually it is a remarkable achievement, especially the frequent close ups. Well edited and a film that is not easily forgotten, thanks to the extraordinary vision of director Carl Theodor Dreyer. He has created a cinematic piece of art.",10,2,4,13 March 2010
District 9," District 9 (2009)
","90/100. What an amazingly imaginative film, and it has a totally unique plot and you can't help admire a filmmaker who can present something so unusual in an era known for borrowing plots from other films. This is not all flash and special effects, it has a real story to tell, and a very interesting one at that, with fine character development, realistic and stylish cinematography, it's brilliantly edited, and a heart pounding score that enhances the film. It's exciting with a pace that takes your breath away. The special effects are indeed special. This isn't a film just for sci-fi fans, it is an amazing tale of relationships and human behavior.",9,1,6,20 March 2010
2012," Just another disaster movie.
","58/100. I was so hoping that this film would avoid all the disaster movie cliché's and at least have something original to offer. It apes everything from Earthquake, Airport The Towering Inferno to the Poseidon Adventure. My hopes for this were dashed rather early into the movie. Indeed the special effects are impressive, the acting is adequate. It's a shame the filmmakers didn't take more risks and try something more original. I knew everyone who was destined to die, the usual cities were destroyed, it was so very very predictable. It's all special effects and melodrama, it lacks substance and originality. On the plus side, in spite of it's extreme length, it did hold my interest.",6,0,0,21 March 2010
From Dusk Till Dawn," From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)
","72/100. This stylish film starts out with a bang and never lets up. I wish they would have just left the vampire angle out, what was an excellent film prior to that, suddenly it went over the top big time. It spoiled the film a lot for me. What a terrific cast, the acting is great, particularly Quentin Tarantino. George Clooney, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel also do a terrific job. Great sound effects and special effects. It does go a bit over the top with the gore. Incredible pacing, the main characters are well defined. It's certainly a film worth watching. It's not for all tastes, but I admire the effort, and it certainly rises above most of the films in this genre.",7,0,0,13 March 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Typical Tim Burton
","Alice in Wonderland has never been one of my favorite stories, and although Tim Burton doesn't quite capture the essence of the book, for me it was a good thing. The look of the film is very expressive with the typical Burton trademark of wildly imaginative visuals and expressiveness. The performances are quite good, particularly Helena Bonham Carter doing a great job imitating Bette Davis in The Virgin Queen and The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex. Wonderfully photographed, superb costume design and the score is well suited to the film. It's not perfect by any means, but Tim Burton is always worth a look, and I was not disappointed.",7,1,2,1 June 2010
Avatar," A visual masterpiece
","It certainly is one of the most visually impressive films ever made. The special effects are amazing. The imagination used in the visual effects is incredible. James Cameron has crafted such an impressive film to look at, so why could he not have used this gift to create a screenplay that was more original, that had more depth and that wasn't so predictable? It's still a good story and the film is enormously entertaining, but the script prevents it from achieving that level of greatness that would distinguish it as a truly landmark film. Great score, the art direction and cinematography are superb. It's certainly memorable and good performances from everyone.",8,4,6,18 May 2010
War of the Worlds," Stick with the original
","The War of the Worlds remake is pretty good, but not as good as I was hoping it would be. One of director Steven Spielberg's strongest traits as a director has been his incredibly well developed characters, especially the children in his films. What happened here? Actually none of the characters were appealing. It's probably not a good thing when you root for the alien's to win over the earthlings. I wanted them to suck up Dakota Fanning SOO BAD just to shut the brat's screaming. Tom Cruise's character of a deadbeat Dad was not exactly a character one would sympathize with, and his performance is very one dimensional. Technically it is terrific. The special effects are first rate, very imaginative and well filmed. Truly amazing in that regard. But as with so many modern remakes of classics, it's all razzle dazzle and so little substance. The original is more than 50 years older than this version, and it still remains the best version. Great special effects are very entertaining, but you need more than that. A film has to have a heart and soul, and not just wallow in a superficial mix of technical achievements.",6,1,3,20 March 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Visually magnificent
","78/100. Impressive feel for the era it was set in, absolutely amazing art direction. The camera-work is also impressive and inventive as well. Great costume design. The score is amazingly good and contributes very much to the films success. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr., but he is quite good. Jude Law gives his best performance in years. The humor in the film is welcome and used appropriately. Fine supporting cast. Sometimes it does go a bit over the top and I don't feel that it is true to the original stories. I don't think Guy Ritchie was the best choice to direct, his style isn't best suited to a film of this nature. Overall the movie is remarkable, and is worth watching for the visuals alone.",7,0,2,14 May 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," Law Abiding Citizen (2009)
","42/100. Preposterous plot that has so many holes it resembles Swiss cheese. Over acted by the leads with unmemorable supporting performances. The score is too intense and interferes with the story. After thirty minutes you just don't care what happens. This plot has been done so many many times before, can't Hollywood come up with something more original? It is never convincing because it is all so absurd. Dark and dingy, it tries to throw in out of place 'Saw' type scenes to attract that audience, making it needlessly violent and unpleasant. A silly mess. It doesn't even make much good use of the Philadelphia location shooting. On the plus side, it does have some good cinematography.",4,5,8,12 March 2010
