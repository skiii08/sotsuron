Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not the best story I've seen but stunned about the special effects.
","This was a long awaited film for me. I grew up on Star Wars, so it means a lot to me. I've expected a little more inventive story and a complete story-telling. Somehow I feel the characters weren't truly explained and presented. The whole film was a little bit in a rush, but it can be forgiven for the tied hands of Mr. Lucas. The special effects are really amazing (from now on there are no limits). The final clash between the Jedi and the Sith lord with the music and design made me to give a full score for this movie. (But if The Empire Strikes scores 10 The Phantom Menace only makes 7.) I expect Episode III to become the best from this trilogy. 'I hope my feelings will serve me well!' 'May the force be with us!'",8,0,0,6 June 1999
Titanic," Slimy story, bad acting, great FX and directing.
","Titanic. The story was really bad everyone knew from the beginning that how it's gonna end. DiCaprio was extremely harsh, presenting himself, I guess. I would give the A.M.P.A.S. awards to the L.A. Confidental. What was good then? Directing was quite okay, and the visual FX were superb.",1,9,21,6 June 1999
