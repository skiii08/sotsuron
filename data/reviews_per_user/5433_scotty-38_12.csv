Raiders of the Lost Ark," Holy Cow!
","Fighting Nazis, recovering a mysterious lost Ark, and running from a gigantic rock. What could be better than that!! This by far is one of Ford's best! If you ever want a movie with a lot of adventure, see this one! I especially like the part at the beginning, when he's flying with Chuck in the airplane. Indiana: 'There's a big snake in the plane Chuck!' Chuck: 'Oh, that's just my pet snake, Reggie.' Indiana: 'I hate snakes Chuck, I hate em'!' Chuck: 'Come on, show a little backbone will ya!?'",10,0,0,31 December 1998
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," No No No!
","No No No! Mr. Mostow, what are you doing! You had this movie going! This movie was fantastic! Why did you end the movie on a sour note? Why did you set the tone for another movie?! This could've been an amazing conclusion to it all! The movie was sooo good until the end. What a mistake. This movie had action, suspense, and curiousity. Why did you end the movie like that?! The ending could have been sooo much better. I'm disappointed. Up until the ending you made me not want to leave the theater. I hate when perfect movies end badly. It could have been better. I wish it was.",10,0,0,3 July 2003
The Fast and the Furious," Why?
","This movie began with a pretty nice drag race. The rest of the movie had absolutely no plot what so ever! It had plenty of nice looking women, and fascinating car scenes, but where the heck is the plot? How can you understand what the movie is about?? They botched it all up! They smashed beautiful women, good car scenes, and some nice action all into one big mess! Why couldn't this movie have had more drag racing and more plot? It definately needed a plot. Bad bad bad.",Null,0,1,11 July 2001
The Exorcist," The Exorcist
","I didn't focus on the acting, or the gore and violence, or the weapons used by the killers in this movie. I focused a lot on the story here. And that is what most of you have to do. You don't quite understand what this movie is expressing. When i saw this movie i was so amazed. The story blew me away. It's unbelievable. To make this movie really seem like a horror movie they added some pretty creepy music which really helped it become a horror movie. I was astonished by this film. It's like the power of God verses the power of the devil. I was really impressed, and it will still remain (in my opinion) a movie with an amazing and astounding story, and also the creepiest and scariest film ever.",10,0,2,27 December 2001
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not bad. A little funny, less scary!
","It's kind of stupid to have a T-Rex in a city. You call this movie scary! The only scary part I saw, was the part where the guy gets eaten by the little dinosaurs. Trust me, the original Jurassic Park was MUCH better! That's all I have to say!",10,6,14,31 December 1998
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not bad at all!
","I'll admit that this movie can seem boring at times. But stop getting bored and pay attention to what this movie is about! I thought this was a great sequel! It may not have gotten a very good rating, but it's actually a very good movie. I especially liked the part with the field. The raptors sneak up behind and snatch someone one by one. Good idea. I liked it. Jeff Goldblum plays a very serious Ian Malcom in this one. He's much different then he is in the first. The ending is quite clever. You might not expect it to happen, but it's quite clever. Good sequel! I liked it.",10,6,15,27 July 2001
Psycho," Freaky!
","This movie freaked me out! I mean, Norman Bates seemed kind, but nobody knew his secret with mother! Nobody knew what his activity has been for years! Norman is VERY weird in this movie and that and his killings were the best part of this movie! YOU'VE GOTTA SEE THIS MOVIE!!! IT IS VERY FREAKY!!! The Bates house is creepy, the final scence in the basement is scary, and the killings are scary. SEE IT!",Null,6,11,22 June 1999
Scream 2," GEEZ!
","This movie is a waste of time! It's not scary at all! It's just a boring teenage flick! The first Scream is the best! Why does this movie have to be so pathetic?! What a mess! There are many more sequels better than this one! Halloween 2, Halloween 4, Birds 2, Psycho 2, ETC. There's a lot more! I'd rate this movie my least favorite sequel horror movie. 3rd time better be the charm in Scream 3! I need to see it! But this movie was complete trash!",Null,0,0,4 January 2000
Jaws," Spectacular!!!!!
","I loved this film!!!! I've seen it almost 20 times now!!!! It is my favorite movie of all time!! My favorite parts were when Chief Brody (Roy Schieder) tells Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to tell a bunch of men who are going fishing to help get them out of the boat and if I remember right they said: Hooper-'Gentlemen, gentlemen, the officer asked me to tell you that you're overloading that boat' One of the men- 'You ain't goin' man what do you care!' Hooper-'Ok well then can you tell me if there's a good restaurant or hotel on the island' One of the men- 'Yeah, you walk straight ahead' Hooper-'He He He they're all gonna die' Yeah I liked that part and the part where Quint dies. This movie has GREAT shark music and it's awfully scary for a crowd of people to go swimming when there is a shark in the water. This movie will teach you to never go in the water again!",10,2,4,9 July 1999
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," OH YEAH BABY!
",This movie is awesome! I really wanted another good Indiana Jones and here it is! I loved the ending to this movie! But there really wasn't a single moment in this movie that i did not like. All of it was great! Connery was great! Ford was great! Even River Phoenix did a good job as young indy! The thing i like the most is Indy beatin the crap outa those nazi fools! Hah! i love it! This one was great!,9,0,0,2 April 2002
Jurassic Park," Best Talk Of The Movie
","The best talk of the movie is between John Hammond and Ian Malcolm.John Hammond: 'This is just a delay, that's all this is. All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.'Ian Malcolm: 'Yeah John, but if the Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates don't eat the tourists.'Hahaha! Great!",10,5,10,9 November 2003
Jurassic Park," Excellent job Spielberg
",Excellent action sequences! This movie had very very tense moments which made it an unbelievable movie. It's dino doom! hah! 'Maybe it's the power tryin to come back on.' Yeah right! Nice. hehe.... i simply loved the action sequences. They did a tremedous job. Sam Neill plays a great role as Dr. Grant. Everyone else does a splendid job as well. Good movie!,10,1,2,27 July 2001
