Iron Man 3," This is how it should be..
","Since my childhood, I was a big fans of IronMan.. And just watching this movie last night..Not too bad.. not too good.. Didn't surprised me a lot.. I think TDKR had better emotional playing on it.. But I guess it's okay, I guess Marvel's franchise didn't take too much emotionally played compare to DC's.. Focusely to Nolan's Lil bit disappointed about 'Mandarin'.. As I know on my childhood, Mandarin was always Iron Man's big nemesis.. but, things got different here.. But I guess, Iron Man 3 is still very very worthy to watch.. I love the storyline better than IronMan 2.. I love Tony's character better here..For guys who disappointed by IM2, you will be quite satisfied with IM3.. So I give 7 out of 10... A quite worthy to watch movie this month..",6,0,5,25 April 2013
Oblivion," Love this... A should watch movie this year!!!!!
","I just watch this movie like 9 hours ago... and Its still in my mind all night... At first, I think its just another casual sci-fi movie.. like just another 'alien wars'.. People's hero and so on... I try to guess the plot and my guess was just right.. until the quarter part of the movie...But after that, this film was just surprising me.. the director bend the plot a lot I guess.. The director just successfully makes this movie special... with the plot,, ending, earth stuff, love story,the angle and else.. *btw, I really love the quality of the picture in this movie...I love this movie.. a lot...its one of my 'best sci-fi' ever... Looking forward to watching this movie for second time... I give it 9 from 10....You should watch!!!!",9,6,15,11 April 2013
