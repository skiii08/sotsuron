Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Disappointing in some areas, but still great entertainment
","I saw the original release of 'Star Wars' when I was 7 and I have never lost the sense of awe that I carried out of the movie theatre that day. My 7-year old mind had never seen anything like it! So I'm inclined to be much less critical than many have been. Sure, it's got plenty of flaws - poorly developed characters, annoying alien sidekick, appalling and cloyingly cute child actor - but it's still great entertainment and candy for the eyes, ears and imagination. Lucas has 2 more prequels with which to really hit his stride - I'm confident he will. I enjoyed it immensely and will see it again.",6,0,1,21 June 1999
