Blade Runner 2049," Not what it's advertised to be - too slow
","I try to not watch all the previews and information about a movie before I see it, and that backfired this time. I should have looked closer at the reviews and realized I'd hate this movie. There were moments that were good, but in general the movie moved soo slowly that it was difficult to stay involved. The incredibly loud blaring low tones were also just annoying after a while and became another reason that I didn't enjoy the experience. Just be warned that you should read the reviews and know what you're getting yourself into. I won't make that mistake again.",3,6,11,1 February 2018
