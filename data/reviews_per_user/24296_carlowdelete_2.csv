Iron Man 3," This is NOT a good Iron Man movie; Not at all
","I am a fan of the first Iron Man movie. The second was not too bad. This one is HORRIBLE! Why is it every series of movies have to try so hard to become a comedy?! What is the purpose? I like comedies and go see them when I want to see a comedy. When I want to see a super hero I go to see one. This is neither. On top of that now any and everyone is now a super hero because they are wear the Iron Man suit at some point in the movie. I believe there was FIVE different people wearing some form of Iron Man suit.How in the world does this get such a high rating from critics too? I'm baffled at that. This movie is about Tony Stark the super dude. They don't even have the suit doing much....unless you count the fact that it seems that everyone is wearing one throughout the movie.I will not be spending my money at a theater for a long time to see another Marvel movie. Internet, here I come because this was a ripoff!",2,3,7,13 June 2013
Captain Marvel," Thank goodness for bootleg movies
","Wow MCU! This is a horrible movie. Horrible storyline. Horrible acting. Horrible fight scenes. Horrible everything.The high star rating of this movie has to be a lie. I love some Marvel movies, and enjoying going to see them in the theater, but I knew from the trailers this would not be all that good, but my goodness, this is crap.",1,74,132,28 June 2019
