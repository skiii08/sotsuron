Angels & Demons," The battle between Science and Religion begins...
","Having not read any of the books but already having a pretty good general knowledge of the Da Vinci Code and having watched the film adaptation of the Da Vinci Code, I didn't know what to expect for Angels & Demons. I mean, many people are familiar with the rumours surrounding the idea of a 'Code' created / discovered by Leonardo Da Vinci. So I thought, what could Angels & Demons possibly be based on? Well it was surprising. The link to contemporary and current affairs was truly outstanding and the way in which current experiments in Astronomy / Physics were combined with possible objections / issues the church would have if these were to go smoothly.Personally, I preferred the Da Vinci Code, merely because it was something most people could easily relate to and the way in which Langdon found his clues were believable. Many people I went to watch this movie with thought the clues were just 'coming too easy' to Langdon this time and they were quite typical e.g. 'The Angels are pointing to where it is hidden!' Despite all of that, it is one of those films you don't mind watching again to gain your own extra clues and similar to the Da Vinci Code, one you can lose the plot with if you don't listen extremely carefully to the revelations.",8,2,3,25 May 2009
Star Trek," It's like sitting in an Edexcel GCSE R.E Exam...
","This movie was amazing! I've grown up watching pretty much every episode of star trek there is to date due to my father's craze about it. I was never THAT interested in it but this movie has done what it was set out to do: it has sparked off a new generation of fans and has re-lit that torch in me that was losing faith in the Star Trek phenomenon.If you love action, special effects in almost every scene, humour and sheer action, this is the film for you.Although I must say at some parts, it's hard to keep up with the story and does switch from scene to scene very quickly. Whatever you do, DON'T POP OUT TO THE LOO OR FOR SOME POPCORN, because you will truly lose the plot completely when you return.For this reason and this reason only, it can feel like you're sitting in an Edexcel GCSE R.E exam where there is no time for you to BREATH, only time to write.But who cares, right? Some people LOVE the adrenaline rush!",10,5,15,19 May 2009
Twilight," Twilight the movie vs Twilight the book in comparison with other film series' adapted from best-selling books
","I agree with the majority of previous comments made about Twilight the movie and like many people who have rushed to watch the movie; I have read most of the series of books and am in the process of moving on to the final book.I too also believe that not enough attention was placed upon Bella's and Edward's relationship which was the fundamental part of this story. I am not sure whether the director is to blame or the actors themselves.I found the personality of the character of Bella come across a little too aggressive and she is supposed to be seen as an innocent girl. The scene in where Bella works out Edward is a Vampire seemed too easily done in the sense that in the book, it was done in the car journey after they eat at the restaurant and I believe she never does out right say he is a Vampire in front of him. However, I do believe this was put in the film to get the adrenaline going which I do not protest against.The prom scene was all wrong. Bella is supposed to be dreading going to the prom and in some ways irritated with Edward, yet she willingly goes with him to the prom in the film.Another important scene in terms of showing their relationship develop is the scene in the book where there is a Biology less which involves blood and Bella seems like she is going to faint and I believe it is Mike who wants to take Bella to the medical place. However, half way there Bella decides to lie down on the pavement for a while and then Edward comes to pick her up despite her stubbornness to stay on the pavement and takes her to the medical place himself. I believe this scene may have aided in showing the development of their relationship much better in the film.I completely understood why James and his coven were seen at the start of the film but only at the end of the book and I believe this was helpful in making the film captivating.I also believe there was something missing from Edward's personality in the film compared to the book; I'm not entirely sure what.Although with every film there are also great features. I believed the special effects were great and they weren't too over the top or too mellow. The baseball scene was awesome and better than described in the book. Rosalie's acting was great as well as Alice's to some extent. Bella's suffering after she is bitten by James is depicted excellently and we feel the pain with Bella. I also loved the idea of showing how James was killed at the end which isn't described so well in the book. I thought when Bella explains to Edward during the prom that she wants to become a Vampire and Edward asks her if she is ready now and she puts her head back and he puts his mouth in position to bite her was done very well.The craze of Harry Potter here in the UK is said to match up with the craze of the Twilight saga in the States, and I must point this out that Twilight after its premier here was said to beat Harry Potter's record and I believe it will not be able to as after reading the Harry Potter books I felt the movies matched up much more precisely to the films and they didn't fail to even captivate the readers who knew what to expect and Warner Bros managed to go one step further in impressing the readers as well, which I felt didn't happen with the movie of Twilight.Finally, I thought it was great that they hinted in the film what was to come in the sequel New Moon which doesn't occur in the book and overall as this film wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be, I hope it was just a warm up as to what is to come in New Moon, Eclipse and probably Breaking Dawn, because the team have got their work cut out for the upcoming films of those books. _____________________________________________________________________I just want to say also, is that seeing it for a second time does really help. Especially when you go with people who are also as interested in the Twilight series as you are. I learnt to like it the second time because I already knew what to expect and saw it for what it was and it did change my pessimistic views slightly...but not immensely. I still believe Warner Bros. could have done a better job and I think I should be glad their changing the Director for the sequel, New Moon.",7,1,4,22 December 2008
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Chris Weitz is a Genius ... better than the book
","This is what we wanted. The book on the screen - Mr Weitz did not do that, Oh no, - he did BETTER.As part of The Twilight Saga Obsession, Twilight left me spitting at the screen for its lack of content, dodgy dialogue and embarrassing acting from Stewart.Chris Weitz just made a book which was three-quarters depression into one-whole adventure. The Jacob-Paul fight makes you cringe, Laurent's swift movements take you into shock-mode and you will find that Michael Sheen delivers the Aro that is straight from the book.The script was (suprisingly) excellent - with dialogue taken out of the book and extra lines that make you think 'if only they said that in the book'. Some lines were so good, they added to the mood created by the scene.Kristen Stewart is almost 90% there, in becoming Bella Swan. Taylor Lautner isn't Taylor Lautner - he IS Jacob Black: completely flawless performance. I'm so glad they gave Jackson Rathborne more Dialogue - he practically said nothing in Twilight. The Vote scene was excellent in introducing the different elements to each of the Cullens' personalities. The humour wasn't too much, but perfect to keep you engaged. LOVED Charlie Bewley's acting - his entrance, composure and first lines were so well done, it made you feel Demetri should be a much more important character in this series.I love that at the end of the Birthday scene, even though in the book ALL the Vampires become ravenous after they see Bella's wound, (to cut costs it was obvious they couldn't do that) they still showed some hostility in the other vampires, with Alice admitting she couldn't be in the same room and apologising for the rest of them as well as feeling guilty the birthday party she planned became such a disaster.Alice's entrance (Bella's House) makes you jump. Also, her first entrance into the movie will stun you, with her enthusiasm and flexibility. She probably held the most memorable quote for me. The revealing of the title 'New Moon' at the beginning, using the phases of a real Moon was an excellent idea, I hope they do something like that for Eclipse, but instead use the red ribbon symbol rather than an actual Eclipse.The werewolf fighting was ghastly! It really made you think THIS IS NOT A GAME! STOP! I was so pleased, they showed Edward's reaction on the other end of the phone, which obviously Bella can't see in the book. However, I am a little irritated why to back himself up, Jacob did not say at least 'It sounded like Carlisle'.There's a cool, subtle special effect where Bella throws a piece of Pizza to Jacob but the scene shifts to Jacob catching a spanner instead of a Pizza - very clever.The music reminded me of the epic orchestrated pieces from Harry Potter, but obviously much more subtle and worked well in emphasising underlying moods of scenes.Victoria's sequences were excellent and almost breathtaking.Sam's cliff dive was the work of excellent cinematography.CGI and Special Effects were not too overdone and crafted to create perfection amongst the audience's reaction and breathtakingly dramatic on-screen.I thought the idea of a cliffhanger ending (although not like that in the book) - even though it required some re-sequencing of scenes at the end, was effective for the sake of the movie and keeping people on their toes for The Twilight Saga: Eclipse.Now for the bad things: There is a REALLY cheesy scene near to the end of the movie, when Aro reads Alice's mind, portraying Bella as a Vampire - it looked like it came out of a Barbie movie - typical slow motion running and out-of-place music that made it seem like a comedy stunt. Jane's entrance was too stomp-like, she is described as a 'mini Alice' the way she glides swiftly across the floor. Her 'Pain' was done too effortlessly, it looked like she was bored and couldn't be asked to show it off. Here smile was extremely freaky though.What was with the underground lift? That was not mentioned in the book and was utterly stupid to have it in the middle of Volterra, which looked pretty renaissance-like and medieval. Surely, if the Volturi Estate is underground - THERE WOULD BE NO WINDOWS WITH LIGHT COMING THROUGH THEM. Where exactly do you explain the light is coming from? Overall, camera shots were much more imaginative, which added to making each scene so successful in keeping us engaged and constantly commending them throughout. It was only 10 minutes into the movie and I already thought it was better than the book. The 'bad things' are so minute and more personal aspects for probably just me that were dis-likable, that I see it fit to rule them out. Another reason I give this movie full marks is because it didn't need you to rely too much on having watched Twilight first as they show you the clips you need from Twilight in this movie (something Harry Potter fails to do - as well as failing to pick out fundamental scenes that are self-explanatory for the audience to remain engaged in the movie).The Twilight Saga: New Moon deserves a few Baftas here and there, but Oscars are still way out of its reach: it's not grand enough, yet (let us wait for the sequels).It is evident that Chris Weitz is a dedicated, faithful and intricate director. Sometimes wanting every minute detail to be perfect can prove to bring a film down, but New Moon needed it.All I can say is, if Chris Weitz is signed on for The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - I have not a single doubt in my bones it will be a masterpiece.10 / 10",10,9,23,20 November 2009
Avatar," Transports you into another World successfully...
","I'm gonna make this quick because I'm still in shock: CGI - Out of this world, not at all mechanical, good luck to the next film trying to break the boundaries of CGI.Plot - slightly typical but successfully misleading throughout the entirety of the movie. Really gets you involved, always emotionally stimulating.Acting - highly skilled, professional, flawless.Cinematography - bloody brilliant.Overall, you're an idiot if you haven't watched this movie yet, get your BUTS DOWN TO THE NEAREST CINEMA and watch a masterpiece.",10,5,11,18 December 2009
Titanic," Perfection
","I have probably seen this movie so many times now, but it is still emotional to watch. It was pure genius to entwine history's most well known ship-sinking with a raw love story. Despite knowing it isn't completely true, you cannot help but think that it could've been one of many catastrophic stories within a catastrophic disaster. I believe the mere plot line kept faults in acting skills, etc so implicit that it is very hard to pick out any sort of fault. Acting skills overall were exceptional and cinematography leaves you awe-struck.This combination has only made this film what it is today - top of the all time box-office around the globe, and it deserves it: a perfect masterpiece.",10,3,5,1 September 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Simply a Slumdog MASTERPIECE
","I only managed to watch this film yesterday evening even though I was planning to go anyway when I found out how many Golden Globe awards and Bafta Nominees it had! I have to say...I have no regrets for sacrificing my relaxation time on a Friday evening to watch something that literally didn't give me the chance to go to the toilet half way through! Slumdog Millionaire is an absolute masterpiece and there is no other way to describe it. Such a simple idea developed into a very believable story which is a literal 'kick in the face' to the Indian Authorities.It reveals the INS and OUTS of the real India you would never have dreamt of (not all the Bollywood rubbish) and takes you through a journey you wouldn't get lost in or be sidetracked.There is some mild humour in this pretty serious movie, some strong language and scenes which make you cringe away, put your hands over your eyes and literally start sobbing (and not many films have done that to me). There are parts where you wish you could comfort people and wish you could kill them yourself.If I were to criticise any element of this movie, it would be Anil Kapoor's acting. He's lost his touch. Even the younger kids who were real children in India who live in Slums were better than him and they just had to improvise.It's definitely worth the watch and I congratulate Film4 for making it look so easy to create a BLOCKBUSTER.",10,1,3,31 January 2009
