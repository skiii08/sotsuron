The Ring," A top-notch thriller chiller, a two-hour freight
","The ring is Gore Verbinski recent contribution to the cinema scene. Verbinski who made his feature film directorial debut with the comedy hit Mouse Hunt, and then the action comedy The Mexican, starring Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini is probably best known for his award-winning work as a commercial director creating the iconic Budweiser frogs. Verbinski has also been honoured with four Clio Awards and a Cannes Silver Lion Award for his innovative work on an assortment of memorable advertising spots, working for companies such as Nike Coca Cola and 7-UP.The Ring was based on a novel written by Kôji Suzuki. It was originally entitled 'Ringu' (The Ring), and was initially  published in 1989. The work was supposedly based on an urban myth. Urban legends are the most enduring, are often the most disturbing-stories of murder and mayhem happening to ordinary people that are shared around campfires, retold at slumber parties and spread through chain emails. Suzuki, who wrote the book, actually a series of novels, was once a somewhat obscure writer, but is now referred to as the Stephen King of Japan.  Japanese director Hideo Nakata brought the story to the screen in his gothic horror mystery 'Ringu,' which was released in January 1998. It quickly became a phenomenon, spawning the most successful horror film franchise in the history of the Japanese cinema. The mainstream Hollywood film community then picked up the basic story of the ring. Ehren Kruger who attended college at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts then rewrote the story to attract the western film audience. Kruger's subsequent credits include the hit horror sequel Scream 3, directed by Wes Craven and John Frankenheimer's action thriller Reindeer Games. The new adaptation of the ring was then produced to Hollywood standard using special effects by a top production team, including Walter F. Parkes and Laurie Macdonald the husband and wife team and heads of Dream Works Pictures and two of the most active producers in Hollywood today. Mysterious videotape is killing off anyone who watches it. Whenever the victim watches it, the phone rings, telling them they have only one week to Live. A young reporter named Rachel is investigating these events, but after she and her small son watch the tape, it becomes a race against time to find out why the tape is killing everyone and how it could be stopped. The story centre around Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is a young journalist with a divorced husband, Noah (Martin Henderson), and a son, Aidan (David Dorfman). Her niece was recently found dead with a look of pure shock embedded in her face as if something scared her to death. Upon Learning that her niece's three friends died at the same time, too, and hearing about a disturbing videotape that is said to kill you seven days after watching it, Rachel comes into the possession of that same tape. Now, as time grows short, Rachel And Noah race to save their lives from impending doom and discover what the tape has to do with a tragedy-stricken horse ranch and a very strange little girl named Samara.The ring is a top-notch thriller, chiller horror for a Friday night date.

Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time
","A stunning masterpiece from the director of the Godfather, Francis Ford Coppola. Apocalypse Now is set during the Vietnam War. It follows the quest of a man called Captain Willard who receives orders to travel up river and locate a renegade officer, the mysterious Colonel Kurtz. Once located Willard is ordered to 'terminate his command with extreme prejudice'. The only problem with this is that as the quest progresses Willard begins to see parts of himself in Kurtz and begins to identify with is intended victim.With an infamous reputation and a cast to match, I built Apocalypse Now up to be a life changing experience. One thing I can say about it is that it stands out among the bombardment of films that my brain has been subjected to over the years. It had a reputation as being a bit of a let down in Coppola's eyes as he spent far too much money for what the film eventually grossed at the box office. To be fair to Coppola, anything that follows a film as prolific and influential as the Godfather would be hard pushed to surpass its predecessor. I believe that Apocalypse Now does this and at the risk of making myself unpopular with all you film buffs out there I believe that Apocalypse Now is twice the film The Godfather is. It is a film that I attempted to watch numerous times but just couldn't concentrate on it, dare I say it I found it tedious. I just couldn't understand how it had the reputation it does. As a film man I very rarely switch a film off but I did this one, at least the first ten attempts. I then was sitting bored the other night and swore to myself that it was something I just had to do so I sat down, stuck the DVD on and started drinking a large cup of coffee. Two and a half hours later I was mesmerised. Some may say it was the coffee, I say it was the film, but never the less that night I just could not sleep with excitement. Apocalypse Now is one of the most disturbing and powerful films of all time, it reflects the true limits of the human mind and demonstrates ideally how our ideology changes in different situations. A true masterpiece of epic proportions, that if stuck with will make you a truly richer person.5/5",10,7,12,20 January 2005
