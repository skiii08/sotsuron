Casablanca," A FILM THAT LIVES ON FOREVER
","It is overrated.Come on folks, a lot of expected power was missing. But hey,why not it still be good! Bergman,Bogey, and Henreid hit as the greatest film love triangle of all time (topping Han,Luke,Lea) and Claude Rains,Peter Lorre,and Dooly Wilson are an excellent supporting cast with Conrad Veidt as the hated villain nazi.A truly beautiful film still loses power and makes the film slightly overrated. But the cast shines with power making it a landmark motion picture.",Null,0,0,30 August 1999
Elizabeth," an amazing look on 'Good Queen Bess'
","This film was very good and probably the most accurate film on Elizabeth ever (minus the sex scene with Lord Bob Dudley). In Cate Blanchett, we can see the real Queen Elizabeth who banished by her father Henry VIII, suffered by the sad deaths of her brother Edward VI and cousin Lady Jane Grey, is a courageous and faithful Lutheran who did all she could to banish Catholocism started by her sister Mary the late Queen and restore Protestantism to England and Ireland and France (as Queen) of course. Sir Walsingham is her most trusted servant and advisor who did all he could to protect her and England.Bob Dudley is the lover that never was a lover. Mary,Queen of Scots is her rival and Mary's cousin is a man trying to marry Elizabeth. The monks and Pope (played by John Gielgud) team up with the Duke of Norfolk, Mary of Scots, and even the 'lover' Dudley to overthrow Elizabeth and take over England. Until they are caught by Walsingham and are all executed. This was an excellent film of good qualitey, it was my favorite CHRISTmas present and I give it a 9 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Null,0,0,26 December 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," a film that feels like no other
","This film, has powerful moments though it seems nothing that could've been made on this planet. But it was a good way of telling everyday life if there were space stations. Kubrick put a very wierd sort of wit and style and this is the movie to remember him by.",Null,2,3,17 September 1999
Psycho," a haunting film
","this film is a masterpiece of suspense, semi-horror, and mostof all romance. All three are haunting as they are placed through Hitchcock's outstanding touches and twists.In the first viewing by you, it will probably be a suspense thriller. The 2nd and 3rd viewings will put interesting questions in your mind like 'Will Marion go with Norman or Sam?' or 'What ever happens to Norman later on?' (of course two sequels were made to solve this one)but most of all this movie should be remembered for being based on probably the greatest murderer of our time named Ed Gein (who is even more psychopath than this movie describes him as). This film is the most haunting film I have seen, Halloween, Scream, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I Know What You Did Last Summer are all just a bunch of stupid bloody teen flicks. But this film is a piece of art.",Null,5,9,15 May 2000
