Hereditary," Cool, uncanny, but never scary
","I liked the movie, but unfortunately it dit not live up to expectations. The slow build up was nice, and the acting of the lead character was superb. The ending was the bit where I was disappointed. I has a couple freaky horror scenes that make it a chilly cool horror movie, but I wanted some more I guess.",7,0,1,27 August 2018
