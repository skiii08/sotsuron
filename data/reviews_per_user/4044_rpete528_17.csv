The Longest Yard," Why Bother
","Remakes are a tough thing to do. They have standards to live up to mostly in comparison to the original version. It's no different with this remake. It doesn't hold up. The story is kind of the same but it doesn't have the same flair as the original. I think the biggest flaw is Adam Sandler. He plays Paul Crew which was originally played by acting legend Burt Reynolds. The difference is BR had a lot of wit in the original where Sandler is dry and somewhat forgettable in this. The movie has funny moments but it just fizzles out and the game between the inmates and guards seems long and tries to be too much like the original with the split screens and some of the antics. Basically the movie doesn't take a life of its own which is it's down fall. It's not a horrible movie and worth a watch,",5,0,0,3 March 2014
Fury," Saw it twice
","I saw this movie twice before it left the theaters. I don't care what anyone posts in here regarding their dislike for this movie. This movie was great. Were there similarities to other movies, yes. Some clich√©s, yes. Find me a movie that doesn't. I love the way the movie was made. The characters personalities and the way they clash. I thought the way the battle scenes were filmed were done exceptionally. Was the last scene over the top? Yeah it might be. Then again, it might not. This movie is a lot better than what some of the reviews here give credit for. Definitely go see this movie. It will keep you in suspense. You may also want to see this for a second time....like I did.",10,9,22,17 December 2014
This Is the End," It Was OK
","I watched this on STARZ the other night. At first I thought this was going to be really good seeing all of the actors that are in the film. The problem is, there really was't much to the story. Basically it all comes down to being the Apocalypse and how each character eventually reacts to it. There are funny moments here and there but just a lot of silly dialogue. Danny McBride has't been funny since Tropic Thunder and he really gets annoying in this movie. Jonah Hill hasn't done anything good since Moneyball. In fact, his humor seems to repeat itself. I do believe you are to think he gets raped by Satan. In 21 Jump Street and The Watch he refers to giving oral sex to men. It's a bit nauseating and old hat. Seth Rogan was last funny in the 40 Year Old Virgin. It's almost like these guys are running out of good ideas. I like the use of the music by Black Sabbath in the movie since they are my favorite band. I don' t know what else to say about hence the 5 stars. I may opt to give it another watch but this movie was just not put together well.",5,1,3,27 January 2014
Lords of Dogtown," The good old days
",I loved this movie. It reminded so much when I grew up then. Skateboarding was the 'in' thing. A lot of kids in my neighborhood did it. We would skate the biggest hill on our side of town and it was a challenge to make it all the way down. The music in this movie sets the tone for emotion. I thought Emile Hirsch was very good as Jay Adams in this film as the 'bad boy' of the group. I think if you grew up in this time when skateboarding was becoming popular you would relate to it better. This movie was put together quite well and was very entertaining. This is definitely a good watch at least one time. I love the part of the film where they skate all the empty pools. How fun that would have been!,10,1,1,21 February 2013
Argo," Great movie
","I went to see this at the theater Saturday night and thought this was a very good movie. There was much suspense and it keeps you going right to the end. I couldn't help but read user changbroot review of this movie. (See below my review). It says he is from Afghanistan and basically this person just trashes the movie since it isn't seen through the point of view of a Muslim. Well, it really is not supposed to be and quite honestly who cares. Most movies are not dead on accurate but I would say having grown up during this time this movie does a pretty good job of telling the story. Affleck deserves a Best Director nod for this and it appears there was much research done to try and be accurate in the way the events unfolded. Again, this is a movie and not real life so I am sure there were things that were not as accurate as well. This is a very good movie and I recommend it highly to anyone.",9,1,2,19 February 2013
Ted," Funny
","I don't care what the hell anyone thinks, this movie is funny...period! Some jackass from the UK suggested Milan Kunis is just average looking as part of his critique of this movie. FU buddy...she is absolutely gorgeous. For those of you that didn't think the movie was funny please remove the stick out of your tight ass. Everything from the narration to all the sarcasm and stupidity made this hilarious. One of the best comedies made in a very long time and I hear Ted 2 might be a possibility. I certainly hope so!!!!! I was just amazed at how many negative reviews there are. Sounds like some of those individuals would find humor in the Wall Street Journal.",9,0,5,23 July 2013
The Day After Tomorrow," Awful
","The only thing good about this movie was the coming attractions. The kicker for me is when the guys crash the pickup truck outside of Philadelphia but manage to hoof it in snow shoes in a mega super storm to NYC..with a functional GPS device and find his kid at the library, which happens to be buried under snow. The idea of this movie is great but it is made poorly and the acting is just average. There are the wolves on the ship. Really? How did they get on there? The idea there would be medicine for his girlfriend on that same ship, the only bottle being in English. What a surprise. Oh yeah, and let's evacuate half the country. This definitely could have been made a whole heck of a lot better",1,5,9,28 January 2013
Divergent," Nonsensical Kid Drama
","Sorry...this movie sucked right out of the gate. If you are over 18 you probably won't enjoy this. This was definitely generated toward the teen population. It just seems to be a poor ripoff of the Hunger Games. It's a post war dare I say apocalyptic war time? In Chicago where people have to join factions to keep harmony and peace. If you can't fit in then you're factionless. You don't really get an idea about the war or really a full picture of who or why these factions are created. There are a lot of holes throughout this picture. You have to be tested to join one of these factions. There is just too much about this movie that is bad. The acting is weak, the writing, all of it. I basically watched this because my wife wanted to rent a movie on a Saturday night and she picked this thing. Hey Verizon, can I get my $5.99 back?",1,2,3,2 November 2014
Goon," Good flick
",I really enjoyed this. For some reason the music to the opening scene grabs me. It sets the tone for the rest of the movie. The humor is good. I like the hockey scenes as well. The players are each defined with their own quirks as well which makes you relate to them. I love Belchior the goaltender. He loves his mom and he loves his Percocets lol. Sean William Scott is a pleasant surprise since usually you see him as a wise cracking smart a--. He definitely can play more serious roles if given the chance but does a great job I feel with his role in this movie. Liev Schreiber was good as well. He definitely plays a good role as an enforcer. I think this is definitely a great watch for any sports fan or at least a fan of this sport. Non sports lovers may not relate the this movie but the humor is there to enjoy. Cheers!,9,5,6,28 January 2013
Saving Private Ryan," There is no other movie
","I spent some time reading old posts in here. Some of them are terrible. One post suggested that the baby boomer generation had to try to prove they were as good as the generations before them. I have no clue what that means. Other post suggest the movie is average once the beach scene is over. This movie is incredible. Every mission, every detail, the thought process of each character, their personalities, makes this movie about as true to life as a movie can get. It is an epic piece of work and kudos to all the actors in this picture that bring this film to life. If the very first and last scenes, not the beach scene or the battle scene in the abandoned town at the end, I mean where the elder Ryan visiting Capt. Miller's grave doesn't drive home what this movie is about then just stick to comedies.",10,2,4,6 February 2013
The Bourne Legacy," Falls short
","When you watch the Bourne Trilogy to me those 3 movies were equal in suspense and excitement. It's hard to come away with a sequel and have it be as good as the first one. Here, Jeremy Renner is really good in his role but I'm not sold on Rachel Weisz. It's like she is trying too hard?? When you watch her and Renner in the car when they leave her burning house it's like she is forgetting her lines or something. Just not very good acting. Anyway, the action scenes are really good but the story isn't. It doesn't carry the same flair or interest like the first 3 do. The movie is not awful but it's not great either. Good to see at least once. It gets a 6 from me.",6,3,5,12 November 2013
Rocky," Cut me Mick.........
","I saw this movie when it came out. I was 13 then so that kind of makes me an old man now. I loved this movie then and I love it just as much now. I think where people are misled is that they feel this is considered strictly a boxing movie. In fact it is part love story as well. It 's funny because as you get older your taste changes in regards to your likes and dislikes. There were movies years ago I thought were good and now I consider them just OK. This movie, however, still moves me. The musical score is well done and provides emotion to the film. I think the only character that may have been done better is Pauly. Other than that this movie is intense and for a film made in 1976 the fight scenes are done pretty good. If you watch them though, there are flaws chronologically. Example, in the later rounds Rocky has no sweat on him in or bruises on his face or you will see a lot of empty seats in the arena. Just things to pick out. When you do watch this and you get to the part where Apollo Creed is being introduced and he is dressed like George Washington throwing money, you can hear someone laugh as if they were laughing at him. Yeah, the little things can be entertaining as well.",10,0,0,12 February 2013
War of the Worlds," Kind of annoying
","This movie was just OK to a point. I mean it never made much sense. The electronics weren't supposed to work and they did (cameras, camcorders). The van they got was the only car to work except for the military vehicles that all worked (tanks, planes, etc). Then the jumbo jet that falls out of the sky minus any passengers. It was hard to like any of the characters in the movie. The kids were especially annoying. The daughter Rachel is bratty and screams through half the movie. The son Robbie is a smartass who becomes obsessed with fighting the aliens. He even tells his father that he should have balls and go back and fight them. Well, the tripods just laser beam the crap out of people until they turn to dust so how the hell did he think he was going to take on the aliens? Just stupid. They go up a hill, there is the moment where father and son connect for a moment. The son says let me go while the daughter is being confronted by concerned people for her safety. The son goes by himself up the hill and then you see a massive fireball the would torch anything in 500 yards and out comes one of the tripods. Skip through the rest cuz the movie is just boring at this point and holy crap, father and daughter make it to Boston where his ex wife and family are and whom do you see? The son...really??? He survived and made it to Boston...I thought he was in for the fight....he didn't do much... lol...and on the doorstep of the Brownstone is the rest of the family who are dressed up like they were having Thanksgiving....just silly. The original movie was way better.",3,2,4,24 October 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The Die Hardship should have ended here
","OK, Johnny boy is an alcoholic. Him and Samuel Jackson have to play Simon Says. The movie is stupid He has to wear a sign saying he hates N------. Dumb, just dumb. All you get from Samuel Jackson's character is how to be a racist. The story is awful and should have never been made. This would have prevented the diabolical mess that follows this hunk of crap. The whole plot to perform the heist is off the charts. It's like the Jaws and Rocky series...nothing should have been made after the first one. You know it's bad when it's difficult to come up with 10 lines to try and create this review. The Tower Heist is better and that isn't saying much.",4,0,1,20 February 2013
Prometheus," All Hype
","Sorry folks but this movie sucked. I remember when this was coming out in the theaters and the commercial for it was on all the time. I saw this on cable the other night and tried to find something to like about it. It wasn't happening. The plot sucked, the acting sucked. In fact, the acting was annoying if that is possible. Without giving it away, the movie just had stupidity all through it. When you watch it you will see. Charlize Theron seemed like this was her first acting gig. I like her too but this was weak for her. The hype this movie got and the delivery you get from it is disappointing. This same night I watched the Total Recall remake on Starz network and liked that better, and that movie wasn't that good. Good luck all you viewers. This is going to be a total let down.",2,3,4,8 April 2013
The Hangover Part III," What a P.O.S.!
","The order of the trilogy is as...the first being the best and funny as hell. The second only able to be funny in a few parts and mostly unmemorable. This installment, however, is absolute garbage. I watched this the other night and it suuuuuuuuucked! Zach Galifanakis just blows in this thing. You want to absolutely just smack this dude. His character is awful and this guy isn't a good actor anyway. Kim Jeong's character was also annoying and not funny. This was just for the money and not the intent to humor. The actors must look at this and ask themselves why they did this disaster of a movie other than getting a nice paycheck I am sure. Please don't waste your time watching this steaming pile. It is a total letdown.",1,2,4,30 March 2014
Cinderella Man," Pretty darn good
","I love how all the historians of boxing and the Great Depression and the haters just down play this movie like it's completely false. Are all the parts of this movie the absolute truth? Probably not. With that said, I believe Ron Howard was trying to capture the goodness and heart of the main character Jim Braddock, played by Russell Crowe. It's Hollywood folks and the truth can be slightly twisted to blown out of proportion in movies. I really enjoyed the movie and thought the boxing scenes were filmed perfectly. Paul Giamatti as Joe Gould was brilliant. I felt his character pieced the movie together. Now, if I am not mistaken, the real life Joe Gould had run ins with the law later on. In the movie they make him out to be a great guy and maybe he was. Some of the acting is a tad bit cheesy but not over bearing or unwatchable. I believe Ron Howard was just trying to capture the feel of someone living through the depression and what one person did to save his family and he did. If your stomach didn't have a little lump in it seeing how tough it was then you just didn't get it. Most of us here wouldn't understand. As far as Max Baer, he is painted as somewhat of a monster. My guess is he wasn't and was given that image as the 'bad guy' for the movie. Overall, this movie is worth the watch and more than once. Great movie from Mr. Howard that leaves you feeling good when it's over.",9,0,0,2 April 2014
