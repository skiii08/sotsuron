Mission: Impossible III," Turning Japanese?
","Did you know that Tom Cruise can run? He can. Did you know that he can smile? He does. Have you ever seen him get angry? Look no further!Has there ever been a less versatile actor with more success? No matter. He knows his strengths and plays to them, and he's never been caught brooding or Oscar-baiting.Mission: Impossible is even less a stab at immortality than most blockbusters. The formula is even baked into the title. Odd that it took three movies for them to follow it! The third time may not quite charm, but it gives us what we want from this sort of movie: flirtation with danger, exhibition of stealth, playful sophistication. You know, stunts and gadgets and dress-up.While never transcending genre, M:I3 is almost entirely content to be what it is so long as it can be Alias! But J.J. & co. steal from themselves admirably. The only real misstep is a political monologue by the villain; such topical boilerplate pulls us out of what is fundamentally a fantasy, and demonstrates the filmmakers' disregard for their own material. Save the preaching, guys; audiences'll draw their own conclusions anyway.I do wish they'd kept the theft to the script, though. The biggest problem with the movie is that it's shot like TV. Tight close-ups, few masters. There's a couple of great set pieces, but they don't get the scale they deserve, and so aren't as impressive or as intense as they should be, because of the way they're shot. Well, it won't lose much on video.Welcome to the big-screen, Mr. Abrams. May you make movies as great as the first 1 1/2 seasons of Alias and the pilot of Lost.",6,0,2,8 May 2006
Blade," Dull
","The seriousness with which this movie took itself kept me from enjoying it; I wanted to laugh, but the wall-to-wall gore n' lore didn't allow it.  The incessantly unpleasant tone makes for a terribly boring moviegoing experience, unless you're the sort that pores over Fangoria magazine.Most offensive are the movie's calculated images- every single moment, practically every shot, is designed around the premise 'what would look cool?'  This renders characters, exposition, dialogue and action completely unbelievable.  It also has the unfortunate- and perhaps intentional -effect of glorifying some truly repulsive, blood-drenched violence.  We can expect as much from a vampire movie, but there's no subtext or allusions here (other than to other movies) and director Norrington shows no understanding of implication or restraint.Not to mention, Mr. Snipes is so pompous, I would rather have seen Blade bite it.",3,1,3,11 May 1999
Brokeback Mountain," A beautiful lie
","Great acting, grand scenery, good writing. A sure lock for Best Picture, and a significant event in movie history. These, and more, I grant Brokeback Mountain. What I want to get at, though, is why I am not joining its legion of revelers. I do not, as so many here, flatter myself for my tolerance and fall all over myself to laud it.Clearly, many find the film deeply moving and identify strongly with its characters and with the dilemma at its heart. We may further debate its merits and discuss its implications, and I applaud the movie for engendering thoughtful conversation about, and consideration of, sexuality and society. It deserves more than mere approval or dismissal. But in reviewing it, I cannot avoid the central conceit. So I'll cut to the chase:The relationship never moves beyond its passionate beginnings. Even if we assume that it could have if given the chance, it's an empty dream. Jack tells Ennis, 'It could always be like this,' but that is clearly a delusion; what were for them the halcyon days of Brokeback Mountain cannot be repeated, much less lived indefinitely. No mature couple, be they gay or straight, can remain as they were at the start. Singularity— an existence apart, seemingly, from obligation and constraint —is, it is clear, integral to the appeal of any illicit affair. We may blame society, fault forces beyond their control that two men in love cannot freely pursue, and allow to develop, their passion. But the movie also asks us to lament that Jack and Ennis never get to return, metaphorically, to Brokeback Mountain— when that haven doesn't really exist at all. It is a constant challenge to live with lasting connection, keep promises, and choose the welfare of others over one's own. To do so is also frequently incompatible with, but ultimately more rewarding than, the pursuit of one's own gratification. Jack and Ennis repeatedly deceive their loved ones— including each other —and selfishly chase after their own fulfillment, and yet the movie has less sympathy for their responsibilities as employees, husbands, and fathers than it does for their affair.I believe that their affair is immoral, and would be still if between a man and a woman (of course, in that case it wouldn't be as notable a movie). While I sympathized with the characters and admired the artistry of the film, I am not moved to mourn the consequences of romantic folly. (For this reason, I also find movies like The Bridges of Madison County, The English Patient, and Titanic fundamentally flawed. ) Romance and sex are not the only components of love.Brokeback Mountain shows the futility of life lived in denial and deception, but assumes that embracing and affirming one's passion is by definition, if not without consequence, more laudable than obligation and restraint. That's an assumption I don't share.",5,8,45,22 January 2006
The Italian Job," Pulled Off
","An opposite-field single.  Gray keeps from overswinging a la Bay & Bruckheimer, going with the pitch he's served up.  This incarnation of `The Italian Job' doesn't have the cache, wit, or style of the latest `Ocean's 11', but then again it doesn't have delusions of grandeur either.  There's nary a scrap of fat on its bones, and the characters are drawn expressively and efficiently enough to keep it from being a soulless exercise.  But an exercise it is.It's an especially nice change to see Mr. Wahlberg appearing to have so good a time, looking so pleasant a guy; this is the wrong kind of movie to be gritting your teeth in, so he's smart to be playing it cool.  More 'Judy, Judy' here than he was in `The Truth About Charlie'- which is not to say that `The Italian Job', or his role or performance within, is worthy of Cary Grant.  For one, his biceps betray his effortlessness- at least fit the forearms into the regimen too, Marky. Sheesh!",6,0,0,2 June 2003
Wanted," who's pathetic and ordinary?
","Not only do the elemental, natural laws benefit us physically, they also benefit us dramatically: when a character jumps from a skyscraper, for instance, we know that he must fall. If the rules suddenly don't apply, we can't be surprised and delighted by the bending of them, because there are no rules to be bent. In ways both literal and figurative, the laws of nature keep our feet on the ground. Sometimes, as in The Matrix, the rules are cleverly rewritten. In contemporary action films, they're more often just ignored. I'm as willing to suspend my disbelief as the next moviegoer, but a few too many jumps from one skyscraper to another and I can bring myself to do little more than shrug. If these assassins can perform such feats of magic, why are they limited to knives and bullets? I can hear its defenders: 'It's only eye-candy.' If only. When the main character looks at the camera and tells me I'm a worthless human being, I take exception, and so should you. This is no Tyler Durden inside an everyman, it's a vapid action movie lecturing me about the purpose of my life. Rarely has a movie so explicitly held its audience in contempt.I'd be angrier if I thought Wanted had a clear, cogent thought in its head. Since it is dedicated only to the aesthetic of Cool, it doesn't; the final measure leaves the viewer unable to account for what he has seen, except to remark that it was sporting of the filmmakers to attempt to show him things he hasn't seen before. Like exploding rodents and the use of a human head as a gun silencer.But it isn't quite accurate to say that Wanted has a, um, wanton disregard for life because it disregards lots of things, including simple logic and the laws of physics. Wanted dispenses with anything that stands in the way of turbo-charged cinematic action. I suppose that's entertainment to some; to me, it's identical to every other testosterone-driven mediocrity that coats the screens. *This* is what is truly pathetic and ordinary.",3,3,8,26 July 2008
Life Is Beautiful," Think again
","(SPOILERS ahead!)'It's not supposed to be realistic! We already know how horrible the Holocaust was.'The above is a direct quote from another user comment. I beg to differ (what, so now we're going to show how hilarious and heartwarming it is?). No movie, or the sum of every documentary, reel of footage, essay, book, novel, etc. could possibly convey the horror of the Holocaust.The first half was moderately amusing, but I was moved neither to laughter or tears by any moment (and in retrospect the first half seems to have been calculated to engender goodwill for the second) in the film. I wanted to be affected by it, and fully expected to appreciate it, in no small part because it came highly recommended to me by a very good friend whose taste usually coincides with mine. But I cannot chalk this film up as a mere disappointment.The dramatist who attempts to muck around with the details of the Holocaust fights a particularly uphill battle, given how acquainted we are with it and its magnitude both in numbers and scope. That said, I have no qualms with dramatic license, provided that it is employed consciously and conscientiously. But 'Life Is Beautiful' is not only unsuccessful but willfully negligent in these respects. (For starters, during WWII Italian Jews remained in Italy...)Factual errors could be ignored had the film been set in a more surreal or fanciful context, but it isn't; details are handled in a slipshod fashion when they're handled at all. And so I couldn't ignore my incredulity at the 'hiding' of the child, that not a single inmate spoke German, etc. ad nauseam.Many times have I heard the protest 'I could never watch 'Schindler's List', I couldn't bear it.' And I respect that. But in the next breath, the same person will often be heard singing the praises of this movie, and that to me is disturbing. The portrayal of the camp conditions alone amounts to a sugarcoating of the Holocaust, making it easier for the viewer to watch; perhaps it SHOULD be difficult, don't you think? But not in Benigni's version- his character even dies off-screen. By pulling its punches, the film is neither as sad nor as funny as it wants to be. The 'hope' offered up in 'Life Is Beautiful' is really just of the standard Hollywood variety, will and imagination triumphing despite the most dire of circumstances. I don't have a problem with such sentiment, I just want a movie to *earn* it, and like so many popcorn pictures, 'Life Is Beautiful' doesn't succeed, despite its unlikely setting. My suspicion is that if the film had originated in Tinseltown, critics would not have been so kind and audiences not nearly so enraptured. You gotta hand it to Benigni, the conceit of the movie is a great ploy and he's got some chutzpah for even attempting it.Could redemption be found in the midst of such atrocities and suffering? I believe so, but the kind suggested in 'Life Is Beautiful' is false and fleeting, evaporating as soon as the kid stops fawning over the tank and wonders 'Where's dad?' (Some have proposed that this makes the film an absurdist masterpiece, but any irony is far from intended- hence the bland, affirming title, the smiling faces on the posters, and the sunny first half.) A father's sacrificial love makes for a more-than-worthy premise for a film, but it is taken to shallow lengths here.Perhaps this wouldn't be so damaging if Benigni had not decided to co-opt for his movie what is arguably the most despicable and well-documented event in human history. The examination and implications of an event like the Holocaust should never cease, but I don't hold out much hope for our ability to avoid more like it, not if 'Life Is Beautiful' and the overall reaction to it is indicative of our ability to prevent such monstrosities just by force of historical memory. How quickly we forget.(There were two things about the movie I liked: the transition in the greenhouse, and the relationship between Guido and his hoped-for, riddling savior.)I am impressed by Mr. Benigni's irrepressible optimism- impressed and annoyed, frankly -but he can't get by on charm this time.",4,5,12,3 July 2000
War of the Worlds," The Next Wave
","While not my favorite of Spielberg's films, I think it will prove to be one of the most lasting, far more so than Amistad or Hook or even Minority Report. The critical and public reaction to it has, for the most part, amazed me; for the part of critics, few had more than a couple of hours to write their reviews before publication, and for audiences, it is far from two hours' of escape, anything but Jaws-from-the-skies. It takes some time, and stomach, to digest. (Two of the more astute considerations are Jim Sheridan's and Ray Pride's). For my part:If the visitors of Close Encounters and E.T. can be easily construed as divine, the aliens in War of the Worlds are demons of a godless apocalypse. If the supernatural, then, is not benevolent, what remains (indeed, the first building we see destroyed is a church)? Sheer, random survival. This movie poses no solution, no comfort, no solace in anything but, as in the novel, the mysterious machinations of biology. While not philosophically rigorous, it contains more ideas and overt connections than are usually forgiven (or even noticed in) a summertime blockbuster even the humor is more complicated. Contrast the emergency- broadcast-system gag with the objects-in-mirror-are-closer-than-they-appear one in Jurassic Park; the latter is simple, release-valve irony, while the former is a multi-layered exposure of the uselessness of human measures. 'Worlds' contains many explicit allusions and references to Spielberg films, but is almost entirely devoid of his typically light touch, freely plundering his customary clichés. 'Think you're safe?' he's accusing. 'You're not.' The direct references to 9/11 and the present crises are surprising, even disconcerting in a commercial film, but they are far from glib or opportune; despite their presence in a sci-fi flick, they (and the movie itself) are quite serious. Unease at their inclusion comes more from their absence in popular culture; the question is why haven't they, nearly four years later, been invoked MORE often? Spielberg knows that they're further under our skin than we care to admit. War of the Worlds is the first creative, intentional response, in commercial film, to the new terrors under which we live. Its obligatory 'happy' ending seems an unfortunate concession to box-office, but doesn't arrive with fanfare, heroism, or even the arbitrary back-lit reunion scene. The only sure cause for celebration is survival. Perhaps no event in our culture has yet taken our 21st century fears so seriously and turned them back on us so unsparingly. War of the Worlds is not, to quote one viewer on the latest superhero suck-up, 'easy to enjoy and see again;' it is a horror movie, pure and simple and unforgiving, with as much to stir and indict an audience as it has to expose and fascinate.",9,2,6,11 July 2005
Man on Fire," Denzel en fuego
","Redemption via revenge. Starts cynical and unsentimental but loses its teeth along the way; this compromises its moral foundation, which in the setup threatened to be formidable. What promised to be a solid genre piece becomes a muddy, plodding mess. The whole enterprise, dragged under by weight of its delusions of grandeur, becomes as fractured as its editing is frenetic. Most amusingly, after 2+ hours of the capital as dangerous, seedy, corrupt, and terminally decadent, the first credit up is the quasi-apologetic 'MEXICO CITY: A TRULY GREAT PLACE' (or something to that extent).",5,11,20,30 September 2004
The Lion King," Yawns over roars
","The adulation this flick receives completely mystifies me.  Dramatically, musically and artistically, it's one of Disney's least distinguished animated entries.  What it DOES have for it is Disney's slickest blend of radio-ready pop songs, celebrity voices, mumbo-jumbo eco-politics, anemic plot, pre-stuffed animals, and slapstick buffoonery.  Commercial alchemy on this level is rare indeed, and try as it might the Mouse-House hasn't been able to top 'The Lion King' yet.  (As for the animation itself, it's impressive but far too grounded in realism.  Give me the lines and angles of '101 Dalmatians' any day.)Spun so neatly, 'The Lion King' is a cinematic confection- tasty as cotton candy and with just about as much texture.",5,1,18,18 August 2000
The Sixth Sense," Mine Is Tingling
","Even apart from its 'surprise' (just to brag, I wasn't fooled) -it's still a good little thriller- very aware of its (structural) limitations and mostly content to be what it is.  Studio films are rarely this efficient or focused.  And Osment is terrific, though it annoyed me to realize that, even without direction, he would have made a much, much better Anakin Skywalker (he was even the right age!!).The smaller moments, though, are what make the movie worthwhile for me- the school play (light years from any of the like scenes in the abysmal 'Simon Birch', for example), the couple in the jewelry store, the events at the wake.  Shyamalan does a good job of showing people relate in _pictures_ (true, a necessity afforded by the plot); it's so much easier, but not nearly so powerful, to let words do all the work. Great decision to shoot in old Philadelphia, too. (Side note: 'Wide Awake' was also a religious-themed film, albeit in a much different way, and I've read that as a child Shyamalan attended a Catholic school at his parents insistence, even though they were/are practicing Hindus.  As his career takes shape, I'll be curious to see how his background is reflected in his films.)It strikes me that the film has benefitted from its relative lack of publicity- one actually had to go looking for information to find out anything.  The less you know, the more the movie'll hit you.  This is a rare instance in which the studio's inability to recognize what they had actually increased the film's impact, not to mention its box-office receipts.That said, it's really just an overlong episode of 'The X-Files' with the 'heart' of 'Touched By An Angel'; theologically dubious and ultimately sentimental.  Is it any surprise that it's become such a success?",7,0,0,7 September 1999
