The Blair Witch Project," What's the problem?
","To me, the Blair Witch Project was something the horror genre may have needed: SOMETHING DIFFERENT!  I will say that BWP was not as scary as I thought it would be.  However, I still enjoyed it because it was something I hadn't seen before.  It was done as a documentary, therefore somewhat adding more authenticity to the film.  And although people thought this was cheesy, I believe that going into the movie thinking it was real made it extra creepy.  Fact is, there are people into witchcraft, and who's to say that something similar (notice I say 'similar') won't happen?  That's also what I think makes the movie so good.  Sure, the filming isn't the best.  The actors are unknown.  But that just makes them ordinary people.  This movie is most likely bashed because of its lack of special effects, blood, and gore.  (It made up for it in the language, however.)  But that makes the movie more authentic and, in my opinion, scarier in a sense.  It leaves you wondering what's going on.  It leaves you thinking of what COULD be happening.  It lets your imagination run wild.  That's what I liked about this film.  I think that once people get past the fact that BWP is NOT a bloodied up, visual effects slasher flick, they would enjoy this more...but that's just me.",Null,0,1,30 October 2000
A Nightmare on Elm Street," What ever you do...don't fall asleep watching this!
","A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET has to be one of the classic horror films of its time.  And personally, it's one of my favorites.  Enter Freddy Krueger, a mysterious man who creeps in and out of the shadows of our dreams.  He can make sleep for us one of the most horrifying events ever.  But it will be okay once we finally wake up right?  Well...not if he can help it.  A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET adds a whole new fear to dreaming.  It puts one question in people's minds: 'What happens if we die in our dreams?' NIGHTMARE faces that fear and introduces a new type of 'boogey-man' that can, in numerous ways, lead us to our demise.  What makes Freddy Krueger different from Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, or Leatherface? Freddy has no limitations.  In our dreams, practically anything can happen.  Freddy can take our worst fears and make them a reality in our sleep.  And, in a sense, Freddy Krueger is now a real character.  (How many of you have dreamed of Freddy after seeing this movie?  I have.)   That's what makes NIGHTMARE a classic horror film.",Null,0,0,30 October 2000
