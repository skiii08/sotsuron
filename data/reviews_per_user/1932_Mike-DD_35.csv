The Blair Witch Project," Headache-inducing
","Although I quite enjoyed this film with its 'innovative' first-persons filming style, I was disappointed at the end when there weren't any witches to be seen at all. All we can see throughout the whole movie were the three main actors, with spooky sounds and jerky footage of the 'scary' surroundings. While I admit that the thought of being caught alone by yourselves lost in the middle of some scary forest is scary, the film could do a bit better by maybe slipping in some footage of 'scary' objects like a fleeting glimpse of a white shawl floating or something. And the jerkiness of the movie gave me (and my friends)an immense headache and nausea during the 2nd half of the show, that didn't subside until about half hour after the show ended. While the big-screen effect of a theater is desirable, I'd advise most to watch it on video at home - that way, you can pause and rest for a while if you start getting a headache.",6,0,2,23 August 2000
Despicable Me 2," Another Excellent Animated Sequel
","The first film was about Gru falling in love with the children, turning a new leaf and becoming a good guy and a father to 3 girls. This is about him, now a good guy, falling in love with another woman and creating a 'complete' family. In the meantime, he uses his skills honed from his evil past to catch another villain.It is just as fun as the first movie. The animation is top-notch, as usual, and the story is both suitable and engaging for families and young children. But the other stars of the film, as with the first, are the minions. They are more frequently featured here, and many even take a turn as evil minions. It's so fun to see them in activities other than assisting Gru - having fun on the beach, in a 'bar', etc.The message is, as usual, about love and family - a father protecting his children, a wayward member who returns to the family fold, fighting for the one(s) you love...The music is much better than the first's, to me anyway. It is more upbeat and contemporary. I also enjoyed how some popular song lyrics were changed into gibberish when sung by the minions - that was so much fun!This is truly a family film that delights. Don't miss it!",8,0,0,27 March 2014
The Mask," Jim Carrey doing what he's best at
","Another movie which showcases Jim Carrey's ability to elicit laughs with comic antics and bodily contortions. Whether special effects were needed is questionable, given Carrey's apparent ability to twist and turn his body and face into all kinds of positions. Even disregarding Carrey's comical talent, this movie stands on its own. The special effects and dialogue, though crass and cheesy sometimes, are a big hit in this kind of movie. Add in Carrey's performance, and the whole show is a riot.",8,0,0,24 August 2000
Coraline," Very enjoyable animated version of a familiar story
","We all know the feeling we had when we were kids: our parents are lousy; if we had another set, they'd love us cos we're just so precious.Well, this isn't exactly like that, but the premise is similar. Coraline feels neglected by her parents, that they don't make time for her or listen to her, or give her what she wants. She crawls into an alternate universe where her Other parents treat her the way she thinks she should be - food she likes, clothes she likes, all the time and attention in the world.But as in all fairy tales (and it's a fairy tale if you think parents will just give you everything you want), there is a caveat. They aren't really the good 'Other' parents; there is a catch that I'll let you find out for yourself. It's both fun and disgusting at the same time.In the end of course, she finds out she really treasures her own real parents after all, warts and all. The process of finding that out, and a subplot of helping the other ghost children trapped there, is a visual and storytelling treat.I highly recommend this. I only wished I had caught the 3D version when it was out in the theatres - I had to watch this 2D and I had the nagging feeling I missed a 3d visual feast.",9,0,0,20 April 2014
Billy Elliot," Excellent British wit
","Another fine example of the British wit at work. Really enjoyed the conversation as much as the movie and the dancing itself. Dialogue's intelligent and worth listening to carefully. Choreography, while not the best, is still believable and enticing. Acting was almost perfect by all the actors involved. It's unbelievably hard to not to feel for Billy or the coal miners. Another top-notch British production.",10,0,0,22 March 2001
Spice World," Sing - don't act
","Girl-bands (or boy-bands for that matter) should just stick to what they know best - singing and making music videos, and this movie serves to prove my point. With their zero acting ability, the movie more than bored me. The only reason I (and my friends) continued watching was the concert and singing parts. Only then were they in their element. Should have rented a video of the concert. Cost the same and I get to see and hear more singing, and no acting at all.",2,2,5,20 August 2000
Rise of the Guardians," A movie that appeals to both kids and adults
","This is one of those rare animated (so-called) children's movies that will appeal to both kids and adults. At least *I* was totally captivated by it. You won't feel out of place watching this with your friends without kids in tow, though there'll probably be many around.The Boogeyman has come to threaten the whole world's children's belief in the 'Big 4' figures called Guardians here - Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and the Sandman, and it's up to a new reluctant and disillusioned guy, Jack Frost, to save them all. I loved how Santa's portrayed as Russian-like, the Easter Bunny is a militant were-rabbit- like giant with an Australian accent and the Sandman is a cute golden pudgy fellow who's apparently the most powerful of the 4. The characterisations of the tooth fairy and Jack Frost seemed appropriate to me.The story reminded me of Neil Gaiman's 'American Gods' - the Guardians derive their power and, to a large extent, their being, from the believing children. I think of it as a metaphor too - the world is a darker place without hope. And the adults and mature kids will find deeper meaning in some of the dialogue - Santa/Christmas being about wonder, Easter being about new life, etc.The humor employed was appropriate and well-done. Sure, there's the occasional physical humor, but there're also the funnily-biting insults and quick comebacks. I thought the animation was top-notch - not in terms of realism or its technical aspects, but in generating the appropriate atmosphere and mood of each scene.And yes, there are the touching moments. 'Jack, he sees you!' is one that almost brought tears to my eyes. I'm not a sappy person, but anyone who's experienced loneliness and ostracism before will understand the feeling.I really loved this film. It is one of the few films which managed to bring me back to my childhood, remembering the innocent years when I believed in fairies and Santa Claus, and now reminding me to keep wondering (as in awe, not puzzlement), believing, and hoping.",10,3,4,26 March 2014
Terminator Salvation," Good visuals, but better story telling needed
","It's rare that sequels can better their predecessors, and in this case, that remains true. Still, it has certain qualities that keep it from being a failure.The visuals are nicely done. The post-apocalyptic world is beautifully rendered in grayscale, imparting a sense of doom and gloom. The battles are well-choreographed, and the CG effects commendable. The attack drones are believable, and we've gotten used to the terminators.Acting's pretty good for a movie that's action-oriented. Christian Bale acquits himself well as the anguished and jaded John Connor, Sam Worthington puts in a commendable performance as the tortured and confused Marcus Wright, and Anton Yelchin is excellent as a young Kyle Reese caught in the middle of a war.Even though the action seldom lets up and the movie intersperses only short dialogue and development scenes between all the action sequences, I still felt there were some which weren't necessary as they did little for the plot. Why have a topless scene in the rain and introduce sexual tension at that moment? It did nothing for the movie. And some of the dialogue was so cheesy they belonged to the original Terminator movie. You also can't help but wonder at some of the unexplained logic lapses - like how an advanced Skynet can't intercept radio communications or take control of the human's machines. Or how the machines have such lousy aim even with advanced targeting systems and rapid-fire weapons. And I thought only movie humans delayed the death of their number one enemy.Despite all this, it is still an enjoyable ride as the story unfolds to its conclusion.",6,1,2,22 March 2014
Fast & Furious 6," Who needs realism with action like this?
","I didn't expect it, but Furious 6 is by far the best of the Fast and Furious franchise for me. The story was for the most part predictable but believable (the same way Mission Impossible, et al is believable), the characters are so familiar little development is needed, and the acting is passable. But the action in this film has been ramped up so much it's an adrenaline rush 80% of the time.Action in the Fast flicks have always been incredible, but here, it is several notches over that. After the movie, you simply cannot imagine how the stunts are done. All I did most of the time was sit slack-jawed watching all the vehicular action unfold on screen. And this time, there are more than just cars, and much, much more than just car racing.And as is the trend now, the film ends with a teaser for Fast 7. And yet another major action star is set to join the franchise. Can't wait!(5/10 for the story but 11/10 for the action, thus the 8/10 score I gave.)",9,1,3,19 March 2014
Over the Top," Not too bad for a Stallone movie
","You can't really say that this is one of Stallone's best work, since everyone will remember him as Rambo, insensitive macho he-man. But it is still cool to see him in a movie that is more sentiment than action once in a while. The arm-wrestling competition isn't really that great to watch at all, since you already know who is going to win even before the competition starts. There are some nice moments in the movie involving father and son, but sometimes can get quite contrived. Not something that you;d actually look for in the video store, but I just happened to see it on Superstation.",6,1,3,16 September 2000
Pacific Rim," Lives up to the hype - mostly
","There was a lot of hype before I watched this. For the most part, it was deserved, though I would have liked it to spend a little bit more time explaining why they could build such a high-tech machine yet couldn't make it work with one operator. I mean, even present-day tech can make pilotless machines, let alone machines operable by one man.Plot-wise, the story moves fast - a short background of the man-monster war, a quick overview of the Jaegar and its capabilities, then lots of action scenes. In terms of action, this movie does not disappoint. There are lots of action sequences, lots of machine-monster battles, and just a bit of psycho-talk to let the heart-rate rest for a while between battles. I didn't particularly care for the slow scenes in-between where the characters examine one another's motives - they didn't add much to the movie, but they didn't distract much from the main plot either.The Kaijus were for the main part credible. I do have some quibble about their origins though. While I can accept them evolving into intelligent creatures, I thought some of their capabilities were too far-out. I mean, an organic being which can generate their own EMP pulse?The acting was passable - for the most part, you could feel the characters' excitement and anxiety. Character development is scant, as expected from an action flick, but I went in expecting lots of epic battles, not character profiles anyway, so it wasn't a loss for me. Many would think me petty for saying this, but Hunnam's voice and tone here grated on me for some reason. And it's not his fault, but he has way too many clichéd phrases.The CG effects were commendable, since it is not easy making battles involving huge robots and monsters seem realistic enough for you to suspend disbelief. I am a little disappointed though that most of the major battle scenes are night or underwater scenes - so some of the action is lost in the darkness - lots of bright lights and explosions, but details are lost.If you're looking for an epic action movie, this one should feel the need just fine.",7,0,1,18 March 2014
Romeo + Juliet," R&J In A Modern Setting
","I sure enjoyed this adaptation of Romeo & Juliet. It was unsettling at first to see a modern setting and music score (especially since I've seen the traditional version in high school so many times for literature classes), but once I got used to it, it was actually quite innovative and stimulating.It took a bit of getting used to seeing actors in modern garb spout Shakespearean English, but the movie, while taking poetic license with the script, did stick to the basic premise of the play. Claire Danes as Juliet was a perfect casting in my view, what I'd expect a traditional Juliet to look like, although I thought DiCaprio looked just a tad too 'soft' to be Shakespeare Romeo.",10,0,1,19 August 2000
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Comically Serious
","One of Robin William's best films then and now. Though the movie is set during the Vietnam war, that does not tone down the comedy that Williams brings to it. Through it all, his character Cronauer manages to lift the spirits of the men at a time when everyone there thought no one's spirits could be lifted. His irreverent takes at anything from the weather to the war itself is simply hilarious and is Williams at his comical best. A definite must-see for anyone who seen the other serious war films and need one which shows you the lighter side of it.",10,0,0,17 August 2000
American Pie," Hilarious
","Even without referring to the 'pie' incident, this is one hilarious movie. Somehow, the acting and antics of the actors and actresses manage to convince me that they are 16 and not in their 20's. Though I couldn't remember doing all those things in the movie just to get sex, I can imagine what 'desperate' teenagers would do to get it. Some of the ways they thought of weren't available at my time (eg, web cam), but I was sure hoping they'd succeed. :) While you won't call this a great movie - it is after all a teen flick appealing to hormonal teenagers - it is still a great movie to watch and enjoy, especially, I guess, if you are a young couple.",8,0,0,21 August 2000
Man of Steel," Watch this for its entertainment value, nothing else.
","As a blockbuster, this works if you watch purely for its entertainment value, and not as an exact chronicle of Superman's origins and life on earth. A 2.5 hour movie will never do justice to a proper telling, no matter who the director or writer is.It starts off building the Krypton backstory, then a few modern-day incidents where he saves some people while having flashbacks of his troubles adjusting as a kid. Then comes the fun part when Superman is revealed and the battles begin not long after.The plot is pretty predictable, in the sense that you could almost always know what the particular reactions are going to be. In that sense, there are few surprises. The action is good but repetitive at times - Superman or Zod or someone else slamming into buildings or the ground. But there's enough of it and other action to keep you engaged. And I thought the scenes of destruction were rendered well enough to still be able to awe you somewhat.Not much acting skills seemed necessary here, though the actors still did a pretty decent job. Henry Cavill is an acceptable Superman, with just enough sensitivity imparted into the character. I thought Russell Crowe did an excellent job as Jor-El, while Amy Adams took some getting used to as Lois Lane.I did have some quibbles though - with Superman's desire to help the humans, he seems pretty blase flying/throwing Kryptonians through buildings and causing huge explosions and great destruction. And didn't seem to care either as demolished buildings start falling, potentially on people (I mean, there are still many of them standing around - I don't know why; Apocalypse had arrived and they were gawking?) Perhaps in the heat of battle, he didn't have time to care about collateral damage. Yet he had time to save the gunner. Maybe he could only see falling people. And Grand Central Station was almost empty of people in this crisis? I'd have thought it'd be packed more than usual. Where did all the people of Manhattan go to?But as I said before, if you watch this purely to be entertained, there is little likelihood you will be disappointed. The story's told pretty well, acting's decent, special effects aren't anything to crow about but the levels of action and destruction are acceptable.",7,0,3,19 March 2014
Armageddon," Runner-up in the 2 asteroid/comet movies
","Out of the 2 asteroid/comet movies out, this ranks as the lousier one. Deep Impact had a cast of more lovable characters whom we can actually 'bond' with during the movie, but with Armageddon, the only character we feel for is Liv Tyler's Grace Stampler. She puts in a pretty convincing performance of a daughter concerned about both her father's and husband-to-be's quest in space. I guess the ending was quite good, although you could almost sense who was gonna be the one to ??? (don't want to reveal the ending...). Quite enjoyable, but I still prefer Deep Impact.",8,1,2,23 August 2000
We're the Millers," One of the best comedies of the year
","A story about a fake family made up of desperate people going to score a deal. On the way, they meet obstacles then break up and of course make up again. I expected a fun movie. I just didn't expect it to be as good as it was.It's funny, there are the requisite gags (but this particular gag is awesome funny), the few unexpected twists or surprises were totally welcome. There are a few standout scenes - the kissing scene, the bitten-by-a-spider scene, and surprisingly, the sing/rap part was really engaging.The acting from the 4 main cast members are good, but personally, I felt the standout actor was Will Poulter. I only knew him from Son of Rambow and School of Comedy, so while I knew he played the dorky son, I didn't expect him to play the character that well. He truly stole the limelight from his more famous co-stars Jason Sudeikis, Jennifer Aniston and Emma Roberts. Kudos to him.Go watch this. It's not a family movie, but it makes for a great outing with the buds or even an adventurous date.",8,3,7,5 April 2014
Ender's Game," Don't watch with pre-conceived notions of how it should be done
","I've never read the books, only the Wikipedia article, so I watched this with little preconceived notions of how it should have been done. And I thought, as a movie, that it acquitted itself quite well amidst all the news and hype surrounding it.I found the movie story told well enough - children recruited for war and the dilemmas it posed, a colonel with a win-at-all-costs attitude and his independent protégé who disagreed. I read some comments which reviled the movie's pace, but I think it was meant to be that way, keeping in mind that the creator of Ender's Game resisted a film adaptation until he had control of the script. I conclude that the movie must have at least compared well enough with his vision for it.The visuals were well done, even if I had some problems with some of the exaggerated gestures used that distracted me from the battle screens. The battle scenes and views of the fleet were done epic-style, but I did wish there were more of it. I also wished the battle and fight scenes were longer - the rush didn't have much time grow before you're forced to the climax.The standout actors have to be Harrison Ford and Asa Butterfield. Ford is excellent in his portrayal of Colonel Graff - the no-nonsense commander who has seemingly no compassion, whose only goal is to win at any and all costs. Butterfield acquitted himself well in the role, but his emotions seem forced - you couldn't really see the battles in his mind unless they were spoken out loud. This may be a fault of the script - there isn't really a lot of time for character development considering the fast tempo of the film. What time was spent for development wasn't used effectively enough.The other actors in the movie performed a good job. The majority of the main cast are child actors, and they did well in roles which did not allow them to be children.If you don't come watching this hoping to see a 100% faithful adaptation of the book, you will be able to enjoy the movie for its story, its visuals and the acting.",7,0,1,21 March 2014
Frozen," Appeals to both girls and boys
","This is one of the best Disney animated films we've seen. There's a story that begins with the usual sadness, tension midway, suspense near the end, then climax with an ending that satisfies everyone. As with all Disney animated films, original music plays a huge part - and we loved most of them. They were catchy or solemn when needed, and got us more in the mood at that time than by visuals alone.Animation is top-notch - ice, ice-sculptures and other ice/water-based animations aren't the easiest to do, but it's done excellently here. Not perfect, but you'll be too engaged in the story to notice anyway.The film has a few surprises in store for you. Some of them you'd decode in a heartbeat if you've seen enough Disney films, others warm your heart. I loved it near the end when what you'd normally expect is actually something else - won't spoil it for you by even hinting at it.Don't be discouraged by expecting some sappy romance - this is really more a story about family and familial love than anything else. And Josh Gad is great as Olaf the Snowman! I love his character's enthusiasm (basically the only one that keeps his enthusiasm from start to end - it's so refreshing from the occasional despondency of the other characters) - wait till you hear his 'summer' song!The kids will love this (yes, even the teenagers), and so will the adults.",9,3,8,28 March 2014
Men in Black," Best alien comedy so far, but could be better
","This is so far the best alien comedy (not movie per se - that belongs to Alien), with good performances from both Smith and Jones. As the two main MIB, they forge a partnership which can sometimes border in the insane, but as the movie progresses, you can see how they complement each other. The aliens created for this movie are also pretty much what we expect aliens to be - gross disgusting creatures, at least the ones who claim roaches as their relatives. It springs some surprises along the way, and Will Smith is great at creating certain comic effects in this movie. But it could have been better if more thought were given to the dialogue and the plot was made tighter. While I have no grouse against the ending, it just felt a little anti-climactic after all that buildup.",7,1,1,24 August 2000
Mission: Impossible," Great stunts, but still needs improvement over the original
","Great stunts galore! And all that fantastic spying techniques and ways to steal secrets and espionage stuff. Certainly one of the better modern spy movies. But what it lacks is still some of the realism that is at least apparent in the original series. Too much stuff here is simply impossible to believe, like that helicopter in the tunnel. It makes for great special effects and stunt work, but instead of becoming a spy movie which is believable, it becomes one in which one has to suspend believe at times so as to follow the story to its conclusion.",8,11,22,24 August 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Twist-and-turning bungling-crooks movie
","The number of twists and turns in this movie rivals that of the snakiest road I once drove on. You never know how something is going to turn up, or what is going to turn up, and you end up moving a little slower than usual. I enjoyed this movie even more as I watched it a few times over the course of a year. It still never fails to entertain, no matter how many times you already know how something is going to happen, or not. A simply hilarious movie that should be irresistable to all.",10,0,0,26 August 2000
Psycho," A different kind of fear
","Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece does not instill fear in you like the modern horror flicks (using shock tactics), but instead subtly introduces it to you throughout the film. This might be because of the industry rules at that time as well, since violence that is too overt wasn't tolerated then. But only Hitchcock can use the rules then to construct a masterpiece, that even now, can cause that lingering fear to creep up on you.I enjoyed the Norman Bates portrayed by Perkins - he is the original and will always be the best Norman Bates there is. The use of 'scary' imagery - spooky house on  top of a hill sihouletted by lightning behind, etc...some call it crude, but in Hitchcock's hands, it is dynamite.Rent it if you've never watched the original (you haven't?!?!), you won't regret it.",10,1,3,17 August 2000
Zero Dark Thirty," Remember that this is a movie, not a documentary
","If you do so, you may be able to enjoy the movie better.Of course, not everything is accurate in the movie. Certain events seem to be over-dramatised. Sometimes, things happen in the movie that are actually very implausible in real life. And of course, a lot of facts or truths are incorporated into the story to lend credibility.Stop imagining this as a documentary on the search and death of OBL. See it as a dramatisation of the real story that incorporates fiction because we suspect no one really knows the entire truth, due mainly to the scope.You may not feel for many of the characters - the story isn't as character-driven as you may expect. But you may come feel that the characters all become insignificant in the grand scheme of things.And no matter your views on torture, you will come to realise real life cannot be supported by idealism alone, and may start to question yourself how staunch your beliefs are, and whether they will stand up to application in real life. It is easy to sit back, in the comfort of our homes, and moralise. I like this movie because it can help one feel the visceral impact of our own morals, wherever we may stand on them.",9,3,7,1 May 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Over-the-top campiness and histrionics make this fun
","I'm normally not a fan of movies employing over-the-top histrionics, but this is a well-done comedy where the campiness and histrionics serve to enhance rather than degrade the entertainment value.This is a movie about a woman trying to make it as an anchor in a male- dominated industry, in a station dominated by a team of male chauvinists. Yet it doesn't try to hit you over the head with Veronica's struggle to make it in a man's world. You'd think it'd be complicated because of the love story between Veronica and her male chauvinist lover and anchor-'boss' (who thinks she's joking about being an anchor), but the movie makes it simple and straightforward.Some of the scenes are incredibly non-believable, yet you enjoy them anyway. That's part of the charm of the show. Even the crude jokes aren't as offensive as you might think.This is no family show, but I feel even your girlfriends will enjoy this ( as long as they know you are not a male chauvinist ;) ).",8,0,0,15 April 2014
Monsters University," College - cartoon monster style, uniquely and well done
","I have to admit something: I prefer 'prequels' to sequels, and may have rated this a point higher than normal, but then again, I believe it fully deserved it. The one thing I like about a prequel is finding out how they became what they are now - the 'before they were famous' story.The animation is top-notch as is usual from Pixar. But I did feel the score isn't as good as it was in the original, but that may be due to this being a 'college' movie, and thus lots of marching-band type scoring.The story is excellent however. Sure, at times it's like a typical college movie - how the protagonists became best friends, the experiences that bonded them together, the hi-jinks and the one awesome event that defined their college experience. But it's not a typical setting (monsters, not people) and it's not a typical movie (animated effects vs real life), and that works in its favor, making this something unique and thoroughly enjoyable.Check out how the typical college experience has been adapted for monsters, see some of the other characters (who are in the original film ) when they were younger, enjoy the references to the original film.Adults will enjoy this, I believe, more than the kids (at least, I believe those with college experiences will). But the younger viewers will no doubt still enjoy the story and the action.",9,0,0,28 March 2014
Trainspotting," Shocking and riveting
","This ranks as one of the year's best movies. Those who have read my other posts will know that I am a big fan of Brit films. I didn't expect the movie to be quite so crass and sexual, and brought a squeamish religious girl to watch it on out first date!There is a lot of 'disgusting' imagery here, but all that adds up to a movie that is realistic in portraying what these addicts must be seeing and going through during their 'up' and 'down' times. It is refreshing to see a movie that is quite frank about these topics of drug abuse, yet is not preachy about it. Really humourous stuff, especially the thick Scottish accent, which makes it hard to follow at times (there are subtitles), but somehow enhances the enjoyment of the film. Fast-paced at times, slow-moving when it needs to be. Surely one to keep in the home video library.",10,0,0,21 August 2000
Thor: The Dark World," Beautiful photography
","Since the first film was based mostly on Earth, we never got to explore Asgard. Well, we get to do that here, and Asgard is breathtakingly beautiful. Looking in part like an ancient city, you get lost in the imagery especially during the battle scenes. The photography is done so beautifully you do not feel jarred seeing futuristic fighters amidst ancient-looking buildings and longboats that fly and shoot lasers. And the various panoramic scenes of a spaceship in the middle of London were well-done too.The fight scenes could have been choreographed better though - at times, I wondered why a technologically advanced race was still fighting with swords and shields while wearing non-functional capes when their defence systems shoot lasers and put up force fields. Asgard is supposed to be the ruling realm but its soldiers fight with swords and shields against laser guns and mini black holes? I'm also surprised its fortress is so easily overpowered - you'd have expected even stone walls and columns in Asgard to have a greater degree of resilience. If the fight scenes were better choreographed, I'd most likely be awed enough to enjoy them rather than think about them.I'm glad to see Heimdall having an expanded role in this film. I did not read the comics, so I was intrigued by the power and responsibility wielded by him, being supposedly able to even deny the King of Asgard entry into his realm. It's great to see him doing much more in this film other than guarding the Bifrost like in the last movie.Loki's banter is delightfully enjoyable as usual. And I especially enjoyed the short scene where he was changing his and Thor's forms so as to be 'less conspicuous'. Apart from the visuals, the story was engaging enough. The plot moves fast, keeping one engaged and interested till the end of the film. Some cheesy lines at the end of the film, but they were to be expected. All in all, a very pretty picture-story backed by a credible plot.",9,0,1,15 March 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," Does not trivialise teen romance/angst
","I thought this was going to be another sad story with a happy ending about a sappy teen romance with clichéd angst, so I didn't watch this till almost 2 years later.I am surprised at the depth of the movie though. A boy meets a girl at a show, they exchange letters about their respective problems, try to guide each other because they had no one else who could help guide and help them, and in the process fall in love. They run away, get caught, then run away again, get caught again. In that process, the people around them learn more about them, and learn to care about them more. The details of the 2 children's, especially the boy's, and the couple's daring actions, move people (including previously hostile scout mates) to help them find a solution, in different ways, to their problem of wanting to be together but being forced apart.The seasoned pros Willis, Norton, Murray and McDormand put on a great performance, but the child leads, especially Jared Gilman, impressed me the most. The acting may not be perfect but it was good, and considering his age, he conveyed the emotions needed better than expected.This may not be a movie that appeals to families, but I think it teaches the families that watch it one thing: communication and understanding. And again, the fact that this movie does not trivialise teen angst issues (eg, 'we've all been there before, it will pass', etc) puts it several notches above similar films in the same genre.Definitely recommended for watching on a lazy weekend afternoon.",9,1,2,3 May 2014
The Sixth Sense," Kid Wonder, Great Movie
","Haley Joel Osment is truly a boy wonder. His acting really made you feel scared, on top of all the scary visual scenes. I've only known a few kids that young who can pull off a movie role that required a class of acting not many adults can achieve, and to do it so well. Kudos, kid. You'll go far.Bruce Willis wasn't really the actor I had in mind for his role as a psychiatrist. I thought someone like Harrison Ford might be better. Nevertheless, Willis did put in a commendable performance, and because the movie was so riveting you hardly noticed his woodenness sometimes.Although this movie does not have spooks jumping out at you for shock effects, it still manages to put a kind of fear in you that cannot be described. The ghosts weren't really scary, but the setting for them to appear and the music that accompanied it, (and of course Osment's acting) made them something not feared in the normal sense, but feared cos no one wants to experience it at all. Then ending is superb, and I just hope no one spoils it for you cos it's just brilliant.",10,0,0,20 August 2000
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," It's Not Battle Royale Because It's Not Supposed To Be
","An earlier reviewer compared this to the Japanese cult favorite Battle Royale and decided it was almost junk. I beg to differ - the film needs to be evaluated on its own merits and its own story. Battle Royale is a single story about merciless, wanton and senseless violence and depravity when the aim was simply to be the last to survive - a kill- fest, where the innovative ways of killing serve to shock and titillate the audience but do little for the plot. The Hunger Games however, is about oppression, fighting back and revolution. The Games, though pivotal, are still part of a larger story.Compared to the first film, this one is definitely darker. The characters look even more despondent than ever, and if you thought there were few laughs in the first film, there is practically none in this. Even the brightly-lit scenes featuring cheering crowds and smiling hosts seemed dim, bleak and depressing. While enjoying the witty banter, you couldn't help but wait for the 'but...'. The feeling of doom and gloom persists from the start to the end of the film. It is not a bad thing though - it is not supposed to be a happy movie.Many details and subplots were understandably cut from the film adaptation, but none that were critical to the plot of the film. However, a lot of the peripheral action that were in the book is missing here, hence, though the story moves quickly enough, there is always the feeling that for an action-thriller, there aren't enough fights or explosions. The ones they movie do have aren't exciting or grand enough.But in terms of story-telling, the movie still works to move from the first film and prepare for the third. The seeds of revolution have been planted and watered, and we now prepare for the maturing and harvesting.Jennifer Lawrence didn't do as well here as in the last film, probably because most of the growing needed has been done previously. Josh Hutcherson though, put in a better performance. While he may previously be the injured lovestruck puppy dog, his maturing into a more complex character in this movie means he starts carrying more of the film.Emotionally, this movie affected me less than the last one. Maybe it's partly because I know what is coming, but that accounts for a very minor percentage. Mostly it's because the film is unable to engage your baser emotions - nothing that truly tugs at your heartstrings. The pervading gloom also seems to have sapped any ability to feel more despondent than you think you already are.It is still a movie that can be enjoyed though, and I did enjoy it enough. Hopefully the next film will provide for more emotional variance. If you don't feel for the characters, you won't care about the film.",7,111,161,16 March 2014
Cloud Atlas," The importance of one man's actions
","This is a movie best watched when you have at least 3-and-a-half hours to spare, since you'll need at least 30 mins to re-watch certain previous scenes to fully appreciate it, given the number of stories told and characters involved.But I liked the way the story unfolded, where each scene from each story was just the right length - long enough to move each story forward, yet short enough so you can still remember where each story left off.The movie had the impact of making me realise the importance of each person's actions, however minor they may seem, in impacting one's future actions as well as the future actions of others. I didn't read the book, so I don't know if this was the intention of the story.All the major characters were beautifully played, and you feel for even the most emotionless of them. That each actor had the same character type to play made following the story much easier. While I was initially hesitant to watch this due to the long play time (almost 3 hours for a dramatic and not an action movie), I didn't regret it.",8,4,6,3 May 2013
The Wedding Singer," Sandler the comic
","Adam Sandler was born to do comedy, not the wacky kind like Jim Carrey's, but the understandable kind and the type you can emphathize with. This movie has Sandler being quite the comic human that he is - the comedy as he goes through a breakup and then chases after Barrymore is true and not contrived. The comedy does not depend on gags or slapstick to achieve its humour; Sandler alone can carry this movie off, that's how good he is in this. Not his best work, but still one of the best.",9,0,1,22 August 2000
The Birds," Still the master after so long
","Alfred Hitchcock is still the master of the horror genre, no matter that cinematic effects have vastly improved and the technology available is a far cry from the 60's. The use of seemingly innocuous animals to strike fear into our hearts, intelligent and masterful use of the camera and suspense building, all build up to a superb film that cannot be surpassed even if the film were to be adapted and 'improved' with the technology today.",10,1,1,17 August 2000
Jurassic Park," The movie I watched it 13 times in a year
","This is simply one of the best movies ever made by Spielberg. The cinematic and special effects, the dialogue (not too complex but still manages to impart a sense of scientific grandeur), the acting (not exactly top-notch but well above average), but most of all, the dinosaurs. Never has one seen dinosaurs so big, terrifying, cute and real. The way these giant lizards move, eat, kill and even think was done so perfectly it almost seems like science fact than science fiction (I know it is science-based, but it is still a science fiction movie).I have to admit that the book was much better, that always happens when you adapt a book - most of the subtlety and intrigue has to make way so a film does not become too long. But it was still one of the best adaptations of a book ever made.Watch the movie, but read the book as well, then watch the movie again. You'll appreciate it so much more.",9,1,3,17 August 2000
