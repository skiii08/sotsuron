Blade Runner 2049," Blade runner 2 -049
",Ryan gosling fits his bladerunner shoes perfectly and portrays the emotions that are relevant as only he can e.g. drive. The cast all play there part very well incl joi(ana d armace) to Wallace(Jared leto) etc in short as no spoilers a must watch for any sci fi fan .. its a truly wonderful spectacle that leaves you wanting more.,9,2,7,4 September 2018
John Wick," Keanu does it again..
","Is he made for these films? Or them for him? Either way the director gets kudos for a wise choice to a guy that never lets you down.
As a compliment He has a cardboard way of acting that is unique,.with a heir of mystery to what he brings. So coupled by a top actor who shows perfect emotion when falling down, you get john wick..a pissed of slightly aging neo who is just as mucha badass. Then throw in some of the best backdrops to modern cinema, a great soundtrack and a very unique story!! All = 10/10",9,0,1,20 January 2019
Darkest Hour," A very rare film in this day and age..
","A very rare film in this day and age, one that got Gary Oldman the recognition he deserves. No spoilers so simply..
A masterpiece of a film from start to finish. based on the true story of Winston Churchill becoming prime minister at the height of world war 2. It's not a war movie per se.. it's a bit of everything & a joy to watch. If you want to extend the cinematic journey, watch Christopher Nolans Dunkirk straight after.",10,1,3,28 February 2019
Captain Marvel," Or supergirl?..
","The comparisons between captain marvel, although older, too superman/supergirl origins, are quite similar. But they tried i guess..Brie is awesome as C'marvel amongst an all star cast, unfortunately due to comparisons it will never fill the superman boots as no remake or comparative ever has, anyway..back to Marv-el, it's is not bad, but! Its the not marvel i know. which i was hoping for..I liked brie as CM & she is a good fit for the future of the avengers and its not a bad film, all in all, However i did expect alot more as a pre Avengers, End Game movie.",5,5,10,13 March 2019
Us," & Down the rabbit hole we go again..
","I like a 90s horror and was drawn in very early as it starts very promising, with intriguing parts, but my personal opinion is, it lost its way, relying on gratuitous gore & light humour & left me ultimately feeling nothing as too much was happening(over done), yes it has hidden cloning, year 86 mssgs that keep you relatively captivated. The acting from nyong'o was superb, a 10/10 in fact as she stole the show..... i wont compare it to get out, as thier simply on different levels one being very good! the other being very much mediocre. Its worth a watch of you like an evil dead type, body snatchers cult movie. 6/10",6,11,25,21 March 2019
Blade," Wallop!
","Yes you have just been smacked by a masterpiece! Its has everything! Great acting, originality, a top shelf cast & some of the best cinematic moments to date. Wesley snipes plays the badass blade as Downey jr plays iron man and that portrays flawlessly on the big screen. Dorff is excellent as frost the narcissistic sociopathical leader of a vamipre clan and the protagonist too a well balanced marvel classic.",8,0,0,21 January 2019
Superbad," One of the best..
",Comedies ever made! A non stop barrel of laughter i have not had since animal house. A brilliant film! encapsulating relationships at the end of college and the bucket list for such a time. Inlc some hilarious extras from the usual suspects(the police) and many others! That makes this one of the best comedies ever to hit the big screen.,9,1,1,5 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," What a mess
",ITS like Salvador dali directed it? What the?? Thors soundtrack is cool and the rest is at times amusing but generally all over the place & a huge downfall for hulk.,5,8,15,10 July 2019
Blade II," Bbbbbbbad!!!!
","It is a rarity indeed when the sequel is better than its awsome predecessor as is the case with blade 2..WOW! They bought it! And with abundance. A better cast then the original, a bigger budget & great script..your in for a treat!The protagonist luke goss from bros?(how!? Did this guy get so good at acting!) Is absolutely awesome as the villain you can emphasis with and the back & forth between him and blade is flawless.. so all the above blends into a cocktail of one of the best movies in many genres and a timeless classic.",9,0,0,21 January 2019
Suicide Squad," That's all she wrote..?
","I felt lost? What was the point and if so why so feeble? it ended like a series from charmed. This is a mass Hollywood potentially epic film, that kept falling short other than an awsome! Soundtrack..Margot Robbie deserves an honourable mention as the one person too really shine in her role.in a word messy",6,0,0,20 September 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Boring
",Not worth the franchise it's mediocre at best and one of the worst of the lot. The acting is abysmal the dialogue is like Swiss chess and the sword play is ???? Pathetic. So choreography is a no! Cast wow so so! & the rest is history thank... 2/10,2,8,15,13 January 2020
Bohemian Rhapsody," What a movie!
",A treat of a film! To remember why Queen always stole the show you are taken on a journey of freddies life from the early days to the highlights of his career incl the triles & tribulations but always a performer..one of the best!,10,2,2,17 January 2019
Bird Box," Here we go again..
","So another phycological m night type apocalyptic paranoid setting..the end.
Its not quite skyline or mist its a bit quiet place with a dash of ??pointlessness, and take what you want from it cause its definately not scary or psychological, as a matter of fact its very mediocre other than some good acting from malkovic & bullock as always, that aside its all been done before & done alot better!",4,1,2,17 January 2019
Split," Flawless..
","Just wonderful..no flaws and a joy to watch Mcavoy show his worth as the shy endearing Kevin and then some. Certainly an oscar worthy performance by jm in a year that gave the darkest hour, get out etc this i must say is one of the best films i hv seen in years. In an almost kubrick type fashion the cast is immaculate, fitting their roles too perfection ( other than the cameraman? ) that aside ;)A joy to watch as you get drawn into the different character's emotional rollercoaster while being gobsmacked by Mcavoys performance and a top shelf script. All in all ..A must watch!Bonus fact: the backdrop for this film is actually taken from the true story of the Cleveland abduction, of three girls being kept hostage in a similar manner, by the infamous serial killer Ariel Castro.",10,2,3,20 January 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Iron man & Cap A-
","What went wrong? Too much thrown into one lonnngggg film..(learn from justice league!) Emotions are everywhere so can not process who?what? where for a second? Thors fat, The hulk!? The HULK! does not throw one blow? Spider-Man is in it for 1minute etcccc.. so your stuck with the most boring of the marvel universe..Robinhood, black widow, iron man 2, the rabbit, what's her face cyborg woman & captain A- ..then fat Thor makes an ugly embarrasing scene as does professor hulk?? & a flying justin bebeir, a bit of poor humour to overlook the severe plot holes. One big action scene that was good if not too messy and snap..
Ps..The time travel is worst than back 2 the future part 3..an Anti climax and a Charitable 7/10.",7,5,10,28 April 2019
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," 'Officer.. its been a doozy of a day' ðŸ˜‚
","Possibly the funniest film ive ever seen! It has everything & the humour & characters are spot on..i happily stumbled along this one, on the television with out a clue to what it was, and within 20mins i was on the floor wetting myself, hysterically! but survived..just full on hilarity from the most endearing yet misunderstood duo you'll ever meet. Part 2 guys..pls!!!!",10,0,0,6 March 2019
Legend," Bravo!
","Finally! after the B movies ive had to endure in regards to the kray twins they've finally made a film worth reviewing. Well Tom hardy always delivers so his Reggie & Ronnie is flawless! Yes he plays both & you wouldn't belive it for a second. The rest of the cast are done to perfection with an all in all well put together film taken from the view of frances, reggies wife. Thus taking on a slightly different journey to its predecessor with the kemp twins, also a good watch but a very close second if not on par version of the krays escapades.. a bit of romance, comedy & a good gangster flick thats well worth a watch.",8,1,3,16 February 2019
The Lion King," Bland..
","Not for lack of visuals, but unfortunately thier is nothing to engage or emphasise with as it lacks massively in emotional content further lacking in that Disney magic..I personally think it's a poor take on a classic original, but no spoilers other than it's basically a nature programme, with poor A list voice overs.",4,78,147,19 July 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy," Brilliant.
","Awsome movie from originality to the epic soundtrack the cast are all flawless the humour is pin point I would happily say it's marvels best film ever made (wrote in 2019) Iron man, spidey 2, blade and this bad boy.",10,1,2,23 July 2019
The Dark Knight," One of the best films ever made.
","This side of batman through the eyes of Nolan crossing swords with the joker was nothing short of spectacular from start to finish. Cinematography is bang on as is the composition, ideology & then there's the acting! The whole cast are great but.. Yes that's right heath ledger & his immortal performance as the clown of crime is a once in a life time performance & deserved of all accolades. 10/10.",10,1,3,14 October 2019
Midsommar," What a pointless mess.
",Extremely psychedelic & that's about it! No composition other than pagan gore and pointless acting & weird noises to do????. The 3 stars are for Florence pugh who manages to hold up a very poor film if not for her captivating performance it's a 1.,3,8,12,24 September 2019
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Brilliant
","Awsome movie from originality to the epic soundtrack the cast are all flawless the humour is pin point I would happily say it's marvels best film ever made (wrote in 2019) Iron man, spidey 2, blade and this bad boy.",10,2,2,10 July 2019
Joker," Requiem of a broken man
","The perfect portrait of a decline to insanity'
& Joaquin Phoenix portrays this flawlessly in a performance of a lifetime.
Choreographed impeccably by Todd Phillips & is nothing short of breathtaking.
The cinematography & backdrop ideology of such an original film for such a complex character is only complimented by the superb soundtrack & acting. A hauntingly beautiful film & A Definate 10/10.
Edit: Bring on part 2 plssssss!. We all want it!.",10,415,711,1 October 2019
Man on Fire," Emotional..
","Due largely to denzels flawless performance coupled by an emotional show from Dakota fanning making their presence a little that similar to leon, which is a great mantel to hold.
This remake, of the same name has a unique modern twist that holds you too the screen with constant intrigue, red herrings and General excellently portayed cinematics, even if at times a little to much, it would not be the same with out that edge of your seat rawness. For what its worth i would advice giving this film a watch! without going in expecting something sensational & see where it takes you..enjoy.",10,3,4,9 February 2019
Bram Stoker's Dracula," Magnificent.
",Is the spectacle that is Bram stokers-Dracula. Based on part of the life of Vlad Tepesh at the height of London's economy boom leading to the most auspicious of encounters between the count & a clergy man thus leading on a cinematic spectacle to this day unsurpassed and some of the most engaging roles to hit the big screen mostly due to arguably the best depiction of Dracul to date by Gary oldman and a great cast in keannu Reeves & Winnona Ryder and ofcourse Anthony Hopkins as Van helsing. A must watch for anyone of age as it's a masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppala. 10/10,10,0,2,11 June 2019
WALLÂ·E," A special magical and beautiful movie..
",I loved it!! For myself its the best pixar film ever made and in my top 10 of all time greats..Thankyou so much for this magical gem. Initially it starts out relatively slow encapsulating Wall-Es slightly mundane life & them takes you on a fantastic journey that only seeing this amazing spectacle will give you a real idea of the gem this film is a SOLID! 10/10 & Bravo! .,10,0,0,6 March 2019
Black Panther," Should be better
",Not for lack of TRYING and it is undeniably a good film but such a iconic character needs to be a better film than the winter soldier movie.,7,0,2,10 July 2019
Blade Runner," A timeless masterpiece.
",If you want a futuristic fantasy visceral dream then look no further you found it! A dream with in a dream is the magic Ridley Scott encapsulated and adapted to the big screen & thankyou so much for doing so! One of the best films to ever be made with an all star flawless cast incl the cat & mouse between Harrison ford & rutguer & many other honerouble mentions..its basically a flawless rare gem and i strongly recommend giving the best sci-fi film ever made a watch..its a must & your welcome .,10,0,2,17 February 2019
300," Where do i start! ..
","Amazing, jaw dropping, a masterpiece of modern cinema.
The fascinating tale of the 300 underdogs taking on the mass army advancing too devour tiny Greece..
Gerard butler picks up the mantle of leonidas king of sparta & does so immaculately to this stylish take on the 300s last stand against the Persian hoard. The visuals are stunning, the acting coupled by a viscously memorable script is undeniably one of the all time greats in its genre. specifically fixing on the Spartan mind set of battle with no retreat no surrender being the catalyst of a very compelling masterpiece that keeps giving you more..the only disappointment was that it ended so soon.",10,4,5,20 January 2019
Green Book," A very special film..
","This Emotional and very enjoyable journey you are taken on, between the relationship of an Italian American and African American at the time of harsh segregation In the deep south. Played impeccably by Marheshala ali as the eccentric pianist extraordinaire(don Shirley) and Vigo morgentson as his Italian big hearted driver(tony lip)whilst watching thier relationship become a thing of magic from the rough to the heartwamring and too add it's based in a true story..A solid 10/10 and the best film I've seen in many years.",10,0,2,23 July 2019
Da 5 Bloods," What da?
","A poor blend of bad acting mismatch characters with no consistency at all. Unfortunately it's all over the place and very unbelievable.
That aside, Wanna make a point reboot do the right thing, now that was a spike lee joint!",2,26,50,13 June 2020
Pineapple Express," Hilarious!..
","Id happily go as far as to say the best movie ever made of type! Up in smoke, Friday etc are awsome and then this baddboyy came along like a new super hybrid. Its a hilariously well made comedy about the crazy day in the life of a dope dealer & his poor client. & lots of other characters (danny McBride was 10/10) & There chemistry between seth & franco is second to none, so hysterical & bang on! In a stoner sense of course. A solid 10/10 & bring on a part 2 plssss!",10,0,2,5 March 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Not mediocre, but Pure Madness at its best..
",Good ol maxy boy is back! And hes hungry!. this visceral beauty of the future in apocalyptic Australia with a backdrop like something from Metallica and then some is awsome!! The cinematography is phenomenal so good in fact that i forgot the highest end of acting between the two dear buddies charlize & Hardy who on screen are great together and perfect for this remake! Thats possibly better than the original(sorry!) Its a hard one so..10/10 best film of 2015 easily! & a must watch i also must add after seeing bloodfather with mel Gibson it would have been interesting if he regained the max mantel but Tommy boy hardy never lets u down.,10,0,2,15 February 2019
