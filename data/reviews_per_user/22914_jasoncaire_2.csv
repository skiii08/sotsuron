Deja Vu," moderately interesting
","it was OK, except having read Pastwatch: the Redemption of Christopher Columbus, the whole viewing the past, time travel and alternative history scenario is covered in that bookin fact it felt like the movie borrowed heavily from that maybe if I hadn't read the book, I would have liked the movie moreI also didn't like the fact that Denzel's character fell in love with the female character in the movie as this seemed unrealistic and obsessive and the happy Hollywood ending where everyone lives happily ever afterIf you want to explore the concept of time travel and alternative history try Pastwatch insteadJC",6,1,2,28 June 2007
The Simpsons Movie," entertaining on different levels but really plays like a long TV episode
","The movie was fun and packed with laughs particularly in the first 20 or so minutes and is easily one of the funnier Simpsons stories.The humor is easily aimed at teenagers and up although in Australia, the movie has been given a PG rating which I found quite surprising given some of the adult themes which are scattered throughout the movie.The storyline is interesting and implausible as you would expect, the only thing it really lacks is something to differentiate itself from the TV episodes. Its familiarity is something it relies upon heavily and it runs for 84 minutes which is slightly too long in the end.Enjoyable and entertaining, albeit familiar Simpsons formula.",6,42,140,18 July 2007
