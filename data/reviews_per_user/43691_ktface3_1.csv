Requiem for a Dream," a beautiful nightmare
","What happens to a dream deferred?Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore-- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over-- like a syrupy sweet?Maybe it just sags like a heavy load.Or does it explode?--'A Dream Deferred' by Langston Hughesthis is one to watch with a group. i couldn't possibly imagine watching this movie alone, because you end up craving human companionship by the end. the characters display a very human-like loneliness, one that i could feel even though i've never had to go through anything like they did. furthermore, the cinematography is entrancing, and while i was watching, i felt myself glued to the TV. after viewing it, i went and read the outside of the box. it explained that each of the characters were trying to fulfill their dreams of pure happiness. i feel like that was an excellent way to describe the hope that this movie starts out with, and that this premise is something everyone can relate to, even if everything ends up going awry for our characters. looking for something to get you good and depressed? this one is it.",9,1,1,26 June 2005
