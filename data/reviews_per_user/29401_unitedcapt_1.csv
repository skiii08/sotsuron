First Man," Abstract art; ruined.
","I kept waiting for the movie to start. It never did. The incessant background music over hushed tones and boring, clipped dialogue. This is what happens when somebody with an abstract view of the world tries to tell a simple story, and absolutely ruin it with 'artistic license'. Nobody talks like that, especially astronauts. I know astronauts. These people are how liberal arts/Hollywood types want them to be; running around in moody, dark, and complicated lives. The constant, weird background sounds and/or music is often so loud that you can't hear the lousy dialogue. If Armstrong was like that, he would never have been at NASA. Other scenes that seem to make no sense or have no meaning. Hard to imagine what actually got edited out; most of the movie deserved the floor. Sorry guys, you're trying too hard to just tell a simple story. Go see Apollo 13 and try again.",2,2,5,9 April 2019
