The Blair Witch Project," Whats all the hubbub, bub?
","My official review of the Blair witch Project.I watched it again yesterday and it is still three of the most annoying half wits i have ever seen roaming around a wood for 90 mins, before getting whacked by a tramp.Could someone explain to me why this film is sooooo amazing? I grant you it's a great use of the budget', but so what? If I came across this on late night channel 4, I would have thought O.K student film. Annoying but has potential'. When it is putting itself up with the big boys it gets judged on its comparative merits. Which are very few. I was glad all three protagonists were murdered. I had so little sympathy for their whiny antics I felt like doing it myself. The acting was lame (But it was a low budget'. So what? They were still rubbish) and the ending was an anticlimax (albeit relief) to say the least.I have to say, though, I don't hate this film as much as I did. When Blair Witch mania hit I had every student and wannabe film critic telling me I had to see it' The indie film of the century' this'll show the big studios'. My personal backlash was so savage I couldn't have a conversation with anyone about it without shouting Your wrong! Its rubbish and you are stupid!'. But now I am calmer. But those who like it are still stupid. And as for those who say its one of the scariest films I have ever seen'",2,3,6,22 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not bad. Gungans tie with the Ewoks for most annoying toy-line though.
","What can you say about episode 1 that has not been said before? Yes, we all hate Jar Jar. Yes, we would like to pistol whip Anakin. And yes, we all wondered how the hell a ten year old boy would manage to sort out Amidala to produce Luke and Leia.It is so difficult for me to give an opinion on the Phantom Menace. On the one hand, the fanboy in me wants to say Of course its brilliant. Its Star Wars!'. But the realist in me watches parts of it and thinks god that was lame'. Its like the cartoon devil and angel on your shoulder. I really wanted to like it. I watched it at the cinema and liked it. I walked out of the cinema still liking it. And for a few days after that I told all my friends how much I liked it. But slowly things started to drift in. Obi Wan sounded like a gay butler'. Anakin was utterly terrible'. WTF is a midi-chlorian?'. And so on. But its Star Wars' I kept telling myself. Over and Over.Now the angel and devil (or realist and fanboy) are, pretty much, at a stalemate. Yes large parts of it were horrible and very merchandisey. I am thinking of taking a court order out to prevent Lucas from directing Episode III. Some of the dialogue was terrible and the less said about the gungans the better. But on the other hand, it was great to see a fully trained Jedi in action (I nearly wet myself when they ran off quickly), Qui-Gon and Darth Maul were superb (although the death of maul was a waste and his lack of screen time was criminal) , the scenery and special effects were superb. And the story, for the most part, was pretty good. I liked the idea of the intergalactic machinations put into play by Darth Sidious.
At the end of the day, Phantom Menace is O.K. It could have done without several of the more stupid scenes (anyone who has seen the phantom edit knows what im talking about) and could have done with more scenes of the council, the Jedis kicking off and a bit more character exposition (with regard to Amidala, the Jedis, Maul and Sidious). So a stalemate. Decent film, nothing to write home about. But not half as bad as some make it out to be.",7,0,1,8 October 2002
Minority Report," Senior Spielberg Strikes Back
","************WARNING: CONTAINS ONE OR TWO SPOILERS************** It is hard to describe minority report. On the one hand it touches on brilliance, the design rationale, the cinematography and special effects are all second to none. The story is compelling and, although it is a long film, the action and story drag you along with it. The ideas and concepts it touches on are thought provoking and interestingly dealt with and the concept of the pre-cogs is an interesting one (although their creation/evolution was not dealt with as thoroughly as I would have liked, but then, I am a nerd for things like that!) On the other hand, however, it seems a fairly sterile affair. Tom Cruise elicits no real sympathy. The supporting characters are pretty nondescript and Agatha is a bit annoying, staggering around screaming like she just drank a bottle of scotch. And the dark nature of the film (the eye clamps, the ethical dilemma's, the fact that Cruise says the F word, even though it is rated '12' (a swearing first in a Spielberg film, I believe)  is repeatedly punctured by things like the 'comedy' spiders and the rolling eyeball jiggery pokery and there are one to many sugary sweet moments. I felt that we could have empathised with Andertons loss just as easily without as many flashbacks/holo-recreations. I would have liked Spielberg to have focussed slightly more on the pre-cogs. Maybe a flashback scene to the children's home or an establishing scene of the pre-crime division, showing its teething problems and how the pre-cogs fitted into the system or 'groomed' for the task. But like I said, I am a sucker for a back story. I enjoyed Minority report in spite of its flaws (although, in the broader sense of things these really were, in fact, fairly minor niggles). It is a solid, well made film and, although there is a certain lack of empathy for the main characters, I feel the story and concepts stand well on their own, driving the narrative forward and allowing the plot to evolve. I think it will stand the test of time and maintain a high position in the IMDB rankings, once the hype has died down and the true ratings emerge and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone. 4 out of five, 1 and ¾ thumbs up, ripe tomato or whatever.The only thing I couldn't work out about this film (He still had access to the building because the man in charge was setting him up, dummies) was that, if all the pre-cog children died, who was going to foresee murders around the country, when pre-crime went national? Correct me if I am wrong but weren't the pre-cogs borne out of the unrefined version of the drug, which has since been purified? They couldn't use the three existing pre-cogs as they appeared to have a range on their talents (only predicting crimes within the city). And if they did manage to get more pre-cogs, what would be the chances that they would be pretty lame (like the twins) and not oracle-like (like Agatha). I'm confused.",9,0,0,10 July 2002
Akira," Enduring. After the DVD release, as fresh as ever.
","I saw Akira when I was 12. I thought it was very cool. I have watched it pretty much once a year after that, understanding more and more each time (it was quite ambitious at 12 to try and 'get' something that I only just understand at 23!). And now finally I get it (maybe).When the new DVD double pack was announced I was as happy as a pig in s**t!! I wasn't disappointed. My favourite part of the new pack is the new dub. Most of my mates (and my girlfriend) have got the concentration span of a gnat and subsequently cant watch subs. The new dub is a significant improvement over the old one, making it easier to follow and removing some annoying voices.The film itself is a tribute to great writing. I love akira and always have. And watching it over the years I have appreciated it on many different levels. The visuals are marvellous and the soundtrack is exquisite. The visual revamp take years off it and it looks as fresh as ever.I sometimes wonder where it could all lead. What would have happened if Hollywood had dramatised it (After the success of LOTR, Sony may reconsider) or if (and this is my personal wish), a studio could animate a serial of otomos original mangas. That would probably be just about the best thing ever. After all, the story is obviously fleshed out and the character of akira is to good to be just a bit part energy being.Come on! You know you want to! Akira: The Series! Akira: The Movie!",9,0,3,1 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Chief Chirpa
","So its now been confirmed that ROTJ is the final Star Wars film (although im willing to bet the studios wont be able to resist trying to squeeze a few more golden eggs from the Star Wars Goose. With or without GL's consent). So what do we think of the end of the worlds greatest saga?
Well, the first thing that struck me was that Darth Vader is actually a bit of a pussy. One of the most dangerous men in the galaxy gets bested in a dual, has his hand cut off by a part time Jedi (two training sessions with yoda? Wow!) and dies after taking Sith lightning for half the time the said part time Jedi did. Although, he is Â‘More machine than man' so the lightning probably would have blown a fuse or two, so I can forgive him for that.
Seriously though, I think ROTJ will stand the test of time. Yes the cloying Ewoks are insanely irritating (it is quite funny when they get blown up. Beechawawa!) but the battle of Endor is good and the speeder bikes are cool. The whole Jabbas palace bit is very good. Everyone tricks their way in and gets caught out and the sarlaac pit monster sequence is great. Some of the dialogue is a bit clunky, but on the whole it is a slick and fast paced film which is never anything but thoroughly enjoyable. Looking at it now as a definite bookend, it is a little disappointing, but hey, what you gonna do?",7,0,1,8 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Please, let someone else direct episode 3........
","Grrrr. Its happened again. I have been to see a star wars prequel. I have come out of the cinema thinking 'that was amazing'. I have realised that quite large parts of it, in actual fact, suck. I did it with TPM and I am doing it now. Although I have to be fair. There were far more things which made my buttocks clench in TPM than AOTC.Ewan McGregor's accent didn't make him sound like a gay butler in this one. He was very good. The fantastic Temuera Morrison made a really good Jango Fett (although I cant see the expanded universe de-decapitating him as they did getting Boba out of the sarlacc). Christopher Lee is always good value, as is Samuel L (it would be interesting to compare their combined box office. SLJ is (or was. this factoid was true a few years ago and I cant see AOTC clones hurting it) the worlds biggest box office draw, in terms of combined gross of films). The Yoda battle was always going to be a crowd pleaser and it didn't disappoint. I am also pleased to see a bit more 'Jedi Lore' creeping in, with the Jedi Library and the likes. And what can I say about the final battle? I don't think I blinked for 20 minutes! And I also liked the noise those charges made when Jango Fett was chasing Obi Wan. And there was also a refreshing lack of Jar Jar, although history will have him down as the man who helped kick the whole thing off. Maybe he will be lynched in episode 3.However, Hayden Christiansen cannot act (how many people were auditioned? Where did they get them from?) and his scenes with amidala were very poorly written and acted (not by the lovely miss portman, though, poor cow). I wish I could get the ladies just by telling them over and over again that I liked them (jedi mind trick?). There was some needless CGI. The bit where anakin rode the cow thing was just terrible. The genosians still sound like gay japanese business men. There were several unnecessary scenes included and some necessary ones missing. The middle of the film was just a bit crap, especially as it was sandwiched between a good beginning and a fantastic end.All in all, the good outweighs the bad. I think out of the two prequels this will stand the test of time. But, unfortunately there are too many niggles for this film to be remembered as fondly as 'star wars' in 25 years.like I always say, George lucas may have crafted one of the best, most imaginative, enduring and downright fantastic alternate realities ever conceived, but he would do better turning over the directorial reigns to someone else.  Empire strikes back anyone?",8,1,1,3 October 2002
"Monsters, Inc."," The world is their lobster.
","I loved this film. It is visually fantastic, well written and very, very funny. The characters are fabulous and well conceived and the story is excellent.
I cant really find fault with it, to be honest. Certainly a worthy followup to the Toy Story's, even surpassing them in some aspects.Its a short but sweet review of, you guessed it, a short but sweet film.",9,0,1,10 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Not just good, its golden.
","I was a precocious brat. I had The Hobbit licked and was half way through the LOTR before I finished primary school. I grew up with these books; the world of middle earth sometimes seemed as familiar to me as the village I lived in. So when LOTR: FOTR came out I really couldn't wait. But on the other hand, adaptations have the habit of, well, sucking. A lot. Luckily Peter Jackson knew his Tolkein onions. He also seemed aware of the possible death threats he would receive from obsessive D+D players.As far as I am concerned Jackson has created something wonderful. He has breathed life into one of the worlds most enduring tales and done it so magically it just entrances you. Most three hour films start to feel like three hours by the end. My arse was going numb by the end of JFK and Titanic was overlong by 2 hours and accounts for three of the suckiest hours of my life. FOTR, however, grabs you by the throat straight away and doesn't let go until the credits roll. And when they did I sat back and wondered if it had really been three hours. Surely that was two, tops. But it wasn't. I was so engrossed, the time just flew.And in those three hours Jackson gives us some of the most spectacular vistas ever seen, some of the best action and special effects I have ever seen and, most importantly, one of the best stories ever told. It could have easily been different. He could have played to the studio. He could have re-jigged the story for modern audiences. He could have played it completely straight and included all the songs (so many it really would have been LOTR: the musical). He got it spot on. He kept the right parts, dropped the right parts and updated the language carefully. The result was a faithful interpretation, which kept the magic of the original, but did not alienate new comers to the story.I cannot praise FOTR highly enough. The only thing which will top it is the new extended version which I cant wait for. Oh, and the next two in the series. Roll on the Ents!",10,1,1,10 October 2002
Aliens," My personal fave of the Alien films
","Once a word that conjured up cinematic awe, it has now lost the sense of grandness it once had, through so-so sequels, merchandise, face offs against every super hero ever (even the green lantern). So. Here goes my review for the last great entry into the Alien Universe. Alien and Aliens. Two very different films by two very different directors. And all the better for it. Whereas the Tim Burton 'Batmans' were great, the total change in directorial style for the sequels killed the franchise dead and made it a laughing stock. Not so Aliens. Ridley Scotts and James Camerons entries into the Alien series couldn't be more different. But the one common factor is that they are both utterly superb (whereas Batman was brilliant and Batman forever sucked ass). As a personal preference I prefer Aliens. Its my kind of film. Thats not to say I don't like Alien. I love it. And I can fully appreciate the view of people who think that it is the best film in the series. But I just love the balls out action of Camerons creation. The film kicks off with Ripley coming out of hypersleep to discover shes spent 50 odd years in stasis. She is recovered and throughly grilled by 'the company' as to why she blew up a billion dollar spaceship. When she cant convince them that she did it to try and kill a crazy ass acid blooded alien they remove her flight license and have her shunting crates about. Then the call comes in that they have lost contact with a terraforming colony on the planet Ripley first encountered the Alien. She decides to go back to excorcise her ghosts. With a load of 'bad ass' marines. The action in Aliens is, while retaining some of the suspense of the first one, superb. Its amazing to learn that there were only a grand total of 6 Alien suits used throughout the whole film! The performances are uniformly good and the characters are all interesting, which is a testament to this not being a mindless action film. The DVD version comes with a pretty flawless transfer and a fabulous 5.1 soundtrack. The extras are a little thin on the ground, but hey. Whatcha gonna do?",8,1,3,20 February 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," more, more give us more!
","CTHD is one of those age-old films that you either love or hate. Personally, I love it. Not as much as some, but love it nonetheless.I am a massive fan of HK cinema. I love its dynamism and flair for the slightly insane. CTHD takes all the things I like about the genre and gives it a hollywood rub down. The production values and cinematography are breath taking. The story actually is enjoyable and the dialogue never really seems stunted. Although some would argue that these are exactly the reasons it is inferior to original HK cinema.The oft-discussed fight scenes are never less than spectacular, with Michele Yeoh really shining alongside Zhang Zi Yi. Although it does make your mouth water to imagine what the film would have been like if Woo Ping had Jet Li to work with as opposed to Chow Yun-Fat. Although I think Li would seem a bit young as opposed to Yun-Fat's almost regal portrayal of a battle weary master.My only real problem with the film is the loooong flashback sequence. It is the only part of the film which even approaches being dull. While I appreciate it sets up a lot of the story and fleshes out Jens character, It is a bit drawn out.I would recommend CTHD to almost anyone. It has heart, action and is aurally and visually stunning. I hope there are further releases based on the mythology of this film. The early adventures of Li Mu Bi and Yu Shu Lien would be fantastic (maybe Jet Li this time?) and a peek at the Wu Dan school would be pant wettingly brilliant. High hopes indeed.",10,1,2,20 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," brilliant
","Excited wasn't the word for this. I was giddy as a school girl (so to speak) and was looking forward to a cinematic treat. And I wasn't disappointed.Firstly I have to say a big thanks to new line for not giving us too many spoilers. I know us fans know what happens (hey, we can read!) but we don't know how it happens (if you follow me). For example, we had tantalising glimpses of Gollum in FOTR. But he was kept carefully under wraps. And for that, new line, I salute you. In the week leading up to the original MIB I had seen trailer upon trailer, music videos, making of's and every interview and clip you can think of. I had, essentially, seen every moment of that film. So the impact had been lost and my enjoyment dulled. Not so The Two Towers.As I went in blind, everything blew me away. Sure, the adverts gave us a few minutes of Helms Deep and a Bit of Eowyn here and there, but nothing major. Everything came to me fresh and kicked a lot of ass. Amazingly enough, the thrill was still there even on my second and third viewings. High praise indeed.With a few viewings it becomes obvious that PJ has captured the essence of the second book, while skilfully leaving out the things he could get away with. For example, the meeting of the Ents and all their songs are, quite frankly, dull and we are well rid of them. The pacing is superb. It never seems to drag and every scene is welcome. It was a hard job following the superb Fellowship but PJ has done us proud.Helms Deep, the centre piece of the film, is just enthralling. From the tear jerking scenes of young boys getting tooled up for war to the rousing sight of Gandalf leading the charge, we are assaulted by a bombastic mix of sound and sights. I can safely say, without hyperbole, that it is simply one of the most phenomenal scenes in cinematic history.  A review of Two Towers wouldn't be complete without a mention of the Gollum. The character is just brilliant. Retaining all the pitiable characteristics of the book. The inner conflict scene had me close to tears!The standard has now been set. The bar has been raised. Fellowship and The Two Towers stand head and shoulders above almost any film I have seen. The quality of them is awe inspiring. My problem now is waiting for the extended DVD. And Return of the King. And how hard is Legolas? He is just a killing machine!",10,0,0,20 February 2003
Men in Black II," MIB by numbers
","Funnily enough MIBII wasn't the crap-o-rama I was expecting. It sure isn't going to win any oscars, but it isn't as bad as its made out to be.There are a few decent gags in here. A few made me laugh out loud. They were usually the more understated ones as the big, obvious ones were a big lame (the michael jackson bit was a arse clenchingly unfunny).
The plot concerns some bad alien looking for something that was supposed to do something, which the MIB were supposed to have got rid of but never did. Ho hum. And the only way to do it is to rescue the 'buddy' formula that worked so well in the first film and ditch Linda Fiorentino as J's partner. In the most hideous way. We sit there wondering what happened to her for like 20 odd minutes and all we get is 'you cant keep neuralizing your partners, J' 'She wanted to go back to the morgue'. A single line. Poor woman.Speaking of poor women, J's new love interest, who may or may not be K's daughter, he doesn't seem to really give a crap, is in the film for a grand total of about 2 minutes. And she is the pivotal plot device.
Anyway, K makes a return at about the 40 odd minute mark which gives him about another 40 mins to get his thang back. This means TLJ's glowering and scowling like he just sniffed a turd for about 35 mins, before he mellows at the ending. He just does nothing. He spends 20 minutes claiming he isn't an MIB and then another 20 being boring. He seems to substitute deadpan for morose (acting like you do when you are a kid and forced to visit your gran) losing all the spark he and Will Smith had in the original. Speaking of Will Smith his character goes from Ultimate bad ass MIB agent to Ultimate Jackass MIB agent when K shows up, just to get the 'rookie' thing going. Which is anoying.All the ingredients are there from the original, but just don't click. There are too many plot holes, too much contradiction and not enough characterisation. Its like how George Lucas has forgotten what made star wars so good, Sonnenfield seems to have stuck to the blueprint but gone wrong somehow. Maybe it would have been better if he wasn't so fervent about his magic '90 minute mark' for films. If we had an extra 15 odd minutes it could have been so much different. Maybe he would have had time for a decent ending...Actually, reading back, I enjoyed this less than I thought I did. How strange.",5,0,0,20 February 2003
Die Hard," First and still the best
","What can you say about Die Hard that hasn't been said a million times before? How about 'its crap'? Well, the reason why that hasn't been repeated ad nauseum is because it blatantly isn't true.Die Hard is one of those rare genre defining films. The first time I saw it I was 9 and was totally blown away. I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.You know the drill by now. John McLane is out numbered (but never outgunned) by a group of terrorists in a high tech building. Cue much death and destruction before happy ending. It sounds so simple. Well, actually, it is. Die Hard perfected the formula of the action film, attempted by so many 80's films. Its actually a testament to Die Hard that they 'don't make em like they used to'.",9,1,1,20 February 2003
Army of Darkness," Army of Darkness=perfect post pub film.
","Army of Darkness is a perfect post pub film. There isnt much dialogue, so you can talk all the way through it, it is violent and, best of all it is incredibly funny. Ash's fight with himself is right up there with the fight he has with his hand in Evil Dead II.The special effects are a little raggedy around the edges (it was made just slightly too early, before CG was extensively used), but it is easy to overlook that through their sheer inventiveness.Basically, it sure aint high brow film making, but it is suitably low brow to be laugh out loud funny. And Bruce Campbell just kills me.",7,2,3,20 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," I think the other two jaded me.....
","I wanted this movie to rock me. I wanted it to blow me away...... but i just sat there picking holes in it.I love the original trilogy with all my heart. I could sit and watch them all day. They are magical films that contain a certain spark. A spark bright enough to allow you to overlook their imperfections.Not so the prequels.They have all been so cold and mechanical they have sucked whatever magic was in them away.For example, the film started with 'War!' and I hummed to myself 'What is it good for'. And it didn't get any better.The slapstick in the first scene annoyed me, general grevious being a coward annoyed me and the jedis practically giving anakin to the emperor annoyed me.I just kept picking holes while I should have been enjoying the culmination of nearly 30 years of film making.The ex-positional scene with Anakin and Palpatine. Palpatine states that one dark lord could influence Midichlorians (blech) to create life. And anakin, being a virgin birth, doesn't once think to say 'oh right. I wonder if he had anything to do with my mysterious origins......'.Things like that kept pulling me back from the immersion I usually give myself to in great films. I just kept getting jarred back to reality.Like I said, I think AOTC and TPM battered most of the goodwill I had out of me and left me cold and cynical.Its not all bad. Some scenes are great. But then they get spoiled by a huge honking lizard.........",6,1,3,16 June 2005
The Iron Giant," 'Lovely Stuff' - Shakin' Stevens
","For all my slam bang special effects action martial arts killing and maiming sensibilities, I cannot fault the Iron Giant.My girlfriend is 24 and she cries every time we watch it. And I cant think of a better recommendation than that.",9,1,1,20 November 2002
Signs," Much better than you've heard
","(Contains a couple of wee spoilers) Things happen by a grand design. So is the point of 'Signs'. Actually its about a few other things too, but hey? Whatcha gonna do? Signs is a bit different to your usual alien invaders schtick. It actually makes you think. There is no 'God bless America' style rousing speeches, no cornball 'welcome to earth' style heroics, no 'monument lasers' or any of the other crap that's become so prevalent in the 'alien invasion' sub genre. I don't think I have enjoyed an invasion film so much since 'Invaders from Mars'. Signs is a suspense building exercise first, UFO movie second, as a result we get to see all of one alien in the whole movie. And one weapon. I know this has dissapointed most people, but it was never the intention of the director to make a heroic 'humanities last stand' type movie. He intended to, and succeeded in, creating a character driven film about a reasonably average family trying to cope with extraordinary events. Its why they don't tool up on guns, steal a space ship and take the fight to them. Its why they hide in the basement and board up all the windows. The exposition of the alien invasion is very well handled. After a series of strange goings on Graham Hess tells his kids 'no more tv', as their imaginations are running away with them. Then Graham experiences things beyond imagination and states 'lets turn the t.v on'. Which plays a pivotal part in telling them and us just what is going on. Such as the utterly marvellous scene in which Merrill sees 'them' for the first time. I also like the directing style. He seems to thrive on the mid shot, capturing so much in the frame. I was also pleased to see wonderful moments of levity in the film which do genuinely make you laugh. At the end of the day, its pretty much a no brainer to criticise Signs. Blah blah blah stupid aliens cant work a doorknob, blah blah blah why corncircles? That's not very high tech for space-faring aliens, blah blah blah earth is 70 odd % water, blah blah blah blah blah. It is, on the other hand, harder to value this film for what it is. If you can't appreciate a movie without 200 CGI shots a minute and a 'God bless America' ending, don't watch this. You will only whine about the 'Stupid Aliens' and wonder why Graham Hess isnt capping ol' ET's ass with his M60.",8,0,1,20 February 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Groundbreaking doesnt do it justice
","The Film that started it all. Literally. Sequels, trilogies, merchandise, you name it. Star Wars (I refuse to call it A New Hope') has shaped the Hollywood we know today.Star Wars isn't a brilliant film. The plot isn't even particularly original. But what it is (or more specifically was) is a totally groundbreaking exercise in production techniques and values. Nothing like it had ever been seen before and as such, captured the imagination like nothing ever had or ever will again.Even by today's standards, the sets are lavish, the costumes are cool and the characters are just fantastic. You can see why literally everything that appears on screen for even a second has its own action figure. Chewie, the Stormtroopers, Greedo and all the others bristle with imagination and convincingly portray a galaxy far, far away' for the first time ever. Personally speaking, I don't think it has ever been surpassed in science fiction and probably never will. And that is why the franchise has been successful. It created a whole mythos, with the Jedi, successfully blending hi-tech with old style religions and prophecies. I don't think there will ever be a phenomenon like this again. And, although The Empire Strikes Back is technically a superior film, this remains, in my opinion, one of the biggest milestones in cinematic history. I mean, look at it! It was made in 1977! I know its been tinkered with but most films dont even look that good today.",Null,1,1,8 October 2002
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," What can you say?
","There is no real point commenting on this film so i dont know why i am bothering. Its like reviewing Air or Food. Everyone knows how good it is and why it will continue to be regarded as a classic piece of cinema for many years to come.One thing i will say, though, is that watching this again makes me wish Lucas had turned the reigns over to someone else to direct, at the very least, AOTC and maybe TPM as well. It is a masterpiece. I fully respect Lucas for the rich and varied world he has masterminded, well thought out characters and intricate plots, but this film is a harsh reminder of what others can do with his dream. I hope he watches ESB and learns a few lessons.",10,0,0,27 September 2002
Princess Mononoke," Oozes class from every pore
","This film has a serious pedigree. It really is a whos who of anime. And the icing on the cake was Neil Gaiman (of sandman fame) scripting the English language version.It is a beautiful story. One of love, ecology and honour. Admittedly when you think ecology it is usually followed by 'Zzzzzzzzz', but it really makes you consider our impact on the environment.I would recommend this to anyone. It is a fine example of the beauty and poignancy that japanese cinema can achieve. It is also a perfect film to show anyone who thinks all anime is, is exploding heads and be-tentacled rapists (albeit, that would seem to be one of the more popular genres in this country, leading to a paucity of releases which actually have a story). Actually, I will rephrase that. Mononke Hime is ALMOST the perfect film for everyone. Its just that at a few points I seems to go mad and overtly violent. Like when ashitaka shoots somebody's arm off with an arrow. It seems almost unnecessary and is starkly contrasted against the rest of the film. Although having said that, the story is deep and complex so kids wouldn't want to watch it any way.****/*****   You wont regret it.",Null,0,1,3 October 2002
