The Blair Witch Project," Two thumbs up..
","Someone finally figured out that we don't need guts ad gore to get our adrenaline pumping, it's the unknown, the wondering, and the what might be out there that terrifies me the most...it's what's left to the imagination....I have never seen anything like it, it absolutely is the first movie I have seen in I can't remember when, that leave images *especially the already infamous ending* racing through my mind, making me scared to go down the dark hall to the bathroom.  Finally someone got it right.It makes us think and makes us conjure up what we fear most, and does the best thing that only a film like this can do to a person, leaves us completely hanging and looking for that unknown shape in the dark...but only the open minded and the truly inquisitive in nature can appreciate this film to it's full extent, so let your imagination run free on this one, and you will truly be fooled into having one of the most frightening, real, movie going experiences of your life....",Null,0,0,7 August 1999
