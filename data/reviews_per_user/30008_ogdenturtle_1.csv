Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," What were they thinking?
","Might I make a suggestion? CUT Penelope Cruz, she was awful. Because of her, I didn't really like this one. I am a HUGE POTC fan, so that's saying a lot. I think you could make the best of all POTC movie if you used these people, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Similar to his character in Hesher), Russell Brand, Rob Zombie and Fergie. Penelope was so bad in this movie that I fell asleep watching it in the movie theater and I had to pay to see it again. But I will not ever watch this one again. The first three films were so amazing, well cast and intense that I fell in love with them and I have seen each of them 30 + times. But Penelope has ruined this one for me and if she is in the next one, I will just stop watching POTC all together.",Null,1,2,4 October 2011
