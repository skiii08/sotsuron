The Avengers," The mother of all superhero movies.
","When The Avengers first came out in May of 2012, I passed it up, figuring that it would be just another boring superhero movie, but when I sat down to watch this film, it completely amazed me with it's fantastic special effects, witty dialog, awesome action scenes and great performances.The film opens with a cool shot of the Tesseract and a chilling voice saying that the cube has awoken and the time is ripe to invade the Earth with Loki leading the Chitauri in an attack and only The Avengers can stop him from conquering the planet but at the same time, the team must learn to work together despite their differences.Now, I never read any Avengers comic books before I saw this film, but it is definitely a dream come true seeing Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow, The Hulk, Hawkeye and Captain America come together to save the world is something that we wanted to see ever since it was first teased in Iron Man back in 08'. This is clearly a movie made for fans of Marvel and Joss Whedon does such a great job with respecting the source material, handling all these egotistical superheroes with different personalities and giving them all an equal amount of screen time while making all the fans happy with this film and so far, the only other comic book movie directors who have been able to pull that off are Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn with the X-Men films.The way the characters interact and play off one another is done perfectly here and while there isn't a lot of character growth in The Avengers as that was what the set-up films were for, Joss does a wonderful job making the interactions between the lead characters feel more real. You might think that with so much going on that the movie would collapse under it's humongous expectations, but thanks to Whedon's directing and writing, the film works wonderfully. The dialog had me laughing my ass off more then a few times while I was watching the film The acting couldn't be better with each actor bringing their acting chops to the table and putting it to good use.I honesty can't see anyone else play Tony Stark/Iron Man other than Robert Downey Jr. He slips into the role so easily, allowing his charm and appeal to shire through and he has some of the best lines in the film. Chris Evans hardens himself in this film as Capitan America/Steve Rogers and truly owns the role in this film bringing a great deal of heart and genuineness to the role and the dialog between him and Stark teases later events in the MCU. Chris Hemsworth once again rocks it as Thor by being more honorable and less conceited not to mention having quite a few funny moments throughout the film. Scarlett Johansson is great as Black Window and proves that she is more than just a pretty face and kicks some serious ass during the battle scenes. The one character that didn't get enough screen time was Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, but thankfully, he isn't chucked aside and does a splendid job playing this character. Hawkeye is right up there with Legolas and Robin Hood as one of the best archers to ever adorn the movie screen. Being the most current actor to play The Hulk, Mark Ruffalo does a great job playing both the angry green giant and the nerdy Bruce Banner with incredible ease and while I do prefer Edward Norton as the Hulk, Mark is a fine replacement and during the film, the Hulk is at his most imposing in the final battle and the scene where he smashes Loki into the floor is just awesome. Samuel L. Jackson gets to stretch his legs a bit as Nick Fury in this film and he glides easily into the role. Clark Gregg returns as Agent Coulson, Cobie Smulders adds a nice touch as Agent Maria Hill and Stellen Skarsgard pops up again as Dr. Eric Selvig as does Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Pots, but Tom Hiddleson is the true star of this movie as Thor's villainous half-brother, Loki and one would think that a role like this would be difficult to play dealing with all of these strong personalities and overwhelming individuals, but Tom nails it and his performance shouldn't be ignored, because it's one of the movie's strong points and Hiddleston comes across as a scheming megalomaniac but without being cartoonish or over the top and he steals the movie every time he's on screen, but Tom also handles the comedy incredibly well with his exchange with Robert Downey Jr. being extremely funny.With a run time of just over 2 hours, the film has a great pace and never once did I get bored while I was watching it. The special effects are state of the art, the musical score by Alan Silvesteri works very well and the action is some of the best I've ever seen in any movie. No body feels cheated when it comes to the battle scenes and the final battle in New York is right up there with the battle of Helm's Deep and the assault on the Death Starr as one of the best on-screen battles ever and the climax delivers an earsplitting level of action that is breathtaking and awesome to behold. Also, be sure to stick around for an end credits scene which provides a nice little set up for future Marvel films.I went into this movie with pretty high expectations and all of them were met. While this movie isn't the best superhero film in my opinion, there is no doubt in my mind that The Avengers is a purely awesome film. It should be watched by any comic book film fan. So go give it a watch if you haven't already, you'll enjoy it.",10,3,7,13 April 2015
Blade Runner 2049," Sci-fi cinematic perfection.
","Given my deep-seated love for Ridley Scot's seminal '82 sci-fi noir classic, Blade Runner, I was over the moon when I heard a sequel was being made and when the first trailer dropped, I grew even more excited about seeing the movie, so I went to my local movie theater with a few friends and sat down to watch it. Once the film ended, I was left in awe and puzzlement at what I had just watched and after doing some deep thinking, I understood what the movie was doing and conveying to me. From it's themes and visual look to it's acting and musical score, Blade Runner 2049 is a wondrous work of modern sci-fi that doesn't pander to or take down to it's audience.The movie takes place in Los Angeles in the year 2049 and follows a replicant named K works for the Los Angeles police department as a officer or 'blade runner' who hunts down and murders replicants that have gone bad. After retiring a replicant named Sapper Morton, K discovers a box entombed under a tree. Inside are the remains of a women replicant who died during a C-section, showing that they can reproduce, something that is thought to have been impossible. K then visits his superior and informs her of his discovery, she is worried that this could lead to war between the two races and commands K to find and destroy the child to bury the truth Along the way, K pays a visit to the Wallace Corporation head office where the dead replicant is identified as Rachel, the romantic interest of former blade runner, Rick Deckard. Now, as K begins to put the pieces together, he must enlist the help of Deckard to assist him in uncovering the hidden truth before society falls apart.While my love for Blade Runner came from watching it several times over many years and a whole lot of understanding what the movie was saying to me and deep thinking on what certain things meant, I came to realize just how much of an artistic impactful Blade Runner had on the genre of sci-fi as a whole and how it altered filmmaking as we know it and due to that, the movie has been seen a masterwork of cinema which is why it's so important to watch the first movie before you watch Blade Runner 2049 not just because it'll be difficult to follow what's going on but also because of Blade Runner's importance and how it shapes 2049 and turns it into one of the best-made movies of the decade and one of the best sequels I've ever had the pleasure of watching.While this movie may not float ever moviegoers boat, it would be impossible for even a casual movie fan to not be blown away by what Denis Villeneuve has given us or how significant the film will become in the future even if some viewers will find the movie boring, lacking any action, witty dialog or bizarre aliens while others love the movie for what it is and what it's telling them. The movie is gloomy, perplexing, bleak, miserable, dismal and empty, set in a future where humanity is clinging on while on the brink of catastrophe so while the movie might be a bit depressing, it's so cleverly put together by Villeneuve and his team that the only other filmmaker that did something on that scale was Stanley Kubrick and given how many of his movies have been despised by so many when they were first released such as 2001: A Space Odyssey which is a perfect example of this as it has magnificent visuals, but it failed hard with a lot of moviegoers and professional critics back in '68, but Kubrick always did what he did best by establishing a second thought in the viewer's head as many left the theaters feeling baffled and even a bit down-beat, but the film sowed the seeds in people's minds that eventually grew over the years. The first Blade Runner archived this to perfection and Blade Runner 2049 is no different. The movie will definitely live on as one of the crowning achievements in the world of sci-fi movies and will continue to be explained, evaluated and talked about for decades to come.Now while the story does carry on from the first movie, it manages to stand on it's own two feet and tell it's own story that does directly link up with the first movie but doesn't rehash the plot of it instead opting for a genuine follow-up set within the same universe. Much like the first one, Blade Runner 2049 is a artistic film encased in a tomb of atmosphere and while several other movies have addressed the issue of what it means to be human and our humanity, there are only been a few that have been able to tackle the subject as well as Blade Runner 2049, but it doesn't stop there. When the viewer begins to explore the themes of both Blade Runner movies, they discover certain allegories, motifs and clear jabs at racism, sexism, exclusiveness and commercialism as well as the misuse of the world's natural resources and neglect of the environment, breach of a person's privacy, disregard for those around us, extortion of the police force and the corruption of power in our government. It's a terrifying sight of what we could become in the future, at our individuality, at our worries from prejudice to temporary insanity to fears that haven't even been named yet but the viewer may also find brilliance, artistic feelings, virtuousness, and the need for compassion and fond memories when watching the film, all that is lost like tears in the rain.The pacing of the movie may be slow but there's a reason for that so the viewer has time to take in all the eye candy and all the symbolism being fed to them while the music, sound and the visuals keeps you focused on what's going on onscreen. While the story of 2049 continues on from the first movie, it grants us a much more diversified glance at what's outside the metropolitan waste-cage and the clamp of overpopulation but there's no change to be found outside of the cities as it still feels like an empty and lonely place even without hordes of people. The bleak desert sands, the enraged ocean waters, the garbage piles of San Diego and the immoral ruins of Las Vegas certainly don't feel any better and yet you are pulled in by it all as your eyes take all the visual splendor one frame at a time. The attack on personal space, unchecked commercial advertising and decadence sticks to the viewer like tar and is set in a blatant comparison with an apparent loneliness on the outside, not enhanced nor inferior, and all connected with superb sounds. Both Blade Runner films feel like an on-going clash between flawlessness and faultiness: our battle to build an ideal world for ourselves leads to a world that is clearly flawed as this is a world created on precarious ground composed of natural, intellectual, scientific, and mechanical disgraces, the kinds we tend to not notch or pretend aren't there. Watch this movie and the viewer soon finds themselves covered by feelings that miss the mark or don't come out right: suffering a nervous breakdown, passing away, decaying, feeling damaged, scraped or kicked around are all feelings shown in the movie and reflect what we as human are and how the future will effect us.When it comes to the filmmaking side of things, Blade Runner 2049 is nothing short of majestic. Denis Villeneuve who also directed Arrival and Sicario goes above and beyond with this movie, giving the viewer a deeply thought-provoking and gorgeous film that carries on from what the first movie set up and improves on it in every single way, in fact, I would place Villeneuve right up with Nolan, Coppola, Kubrick and Spielberg in the near future. The screenplay by Michael Green and Hampton Fancher is superb and emotional in its execution while allowing the story to go in new areas but without losing sight of what made the first one so wonderful in the first place. The photography and the visual look of the movie is amazing thanks to Roger Deakins who has already left his creative mark on such movies as Shawshank Redemption, Skyfall and The Big Lebowski just to name a few. The various settings all look different and provides the exposition though the visuals rather than just dumping it on the audience and the cinematography is key to telling that aspect of the story as everything looks absolutely stunning from the drizzly city streets and the eerily dirty landscapes to the snowy locales yet they never like they're part of the actual movie but instead part of a bigger world. As for the visual effects, they are just as spectacular as a mix of both real and CGI effects was used to create the world of the futuristic Los Angeles and it works incredibly beautiful when paired with the excellent production design, it truly does show the time, effort and care that was put into making the effects look as believable as possible and they look absolutely fantastic when they are seen on screen. Much like what Vangelis did for the first Blade Runner in terms of the musical score, the score for Blade Runner 2049 is just as perfect if not superior thanks to the composing talents of Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch. Their gloomy yet amazingly heart-pounding score fittingly mirrors the themes and tracks that Vangelis used in the first movie while developing a soundtrack that has the complexities worthy of such a movie. In addition, while the musical score to the first movie can be repeated and listened to without having to see the movie, the score for 2049 is so thickly interlinked into the film that it's impossible to have the same replay mentality as the first one. The computerized and manufactured characteristics of the score builds on the wild shock of the human aspect on the Earth long before any of the visuals kick in. Another accomplishment in terms of the film's musical score is the creepy usage of a short but familiar fragment from Peter and The Wolf which adds to the dreariness and bleakness of the movie and disjointed songs by Sinatra and Elvis are just as frightening and exotic when set against the apocalyptic landscapes. Truly one of the clowning achievements of film scores in the last decade.When it comes to the acting, it",10,2,10,22 April 2018
The Incredible Hulk," Makes Ang Lee's Hulk look like Batman and Robin.
","When Ang Lee's version of the big green monster came out in the summer of '03, it smashed box office records and outdid all expectations and was soon on its way to becoming one of the grandest comic book films ever made, then came the bad word of mouth and by the next weekend the film had plummeted a massive 60% and was left thrashing in theaters and was only able to make a profit thanks to a worldwide opening. Marvel was left not knowing what to do as the movie's massive opening had shown a natural appeal to the film, yet Hulk fans obviously didn't enjoy what they were watching on screen. While Lee's film was splendid in its scale and motivations, it clearly wasn't a typical comic book action film and at the end of the day, most movie goers don't care for a two-and-a-half hour mental investigation when watching a Hulk movie, they want to see epic battle scenes and lots of smashing things, both of which the 2003 version of the Hulk failed to give audiences.Now, I never saw this film when it came out in the summer of '08, so much like Iron Man, I didn't know what I was going to see when I watched this movie; well fear not, this movie is miles better than then the '03 film in every way from the diction to the acting to the action.The film opens with General William 'Thunderbolt' Ross meeting with Bruce Banner about testing that will supposedly make people resistant to gamma radiation, but the test doesn't work and causes Banner to turn into the Hulk and go on the run from the military and Ross who now wants the Hulk weaponized. It then cuts to five years later with Banner working at a soda factory in Rio de Janeiro until Ross dispatches a SWART team to arrest Banner, but Bruce transforms into the Hulk, fights off the army and escapes. Once he reaches the US, Banner reunites with Betty Ross and now must contend with her father, the whole US army while battling the monster within.The story here is great, with a superb script thanks in no small part to Edward Norton, particularly when it comes to the dialog. Despite being somber, the movie does have humor sprinkled throughout, making plentiful references to the TV show and characters in the Marvel universe. The directing by Louis Leterrier is also great for this kind of summer action film, effectively providing both action and more personal scenes to the viewer and making the movie a cinematic answer to a well-oiled car: a expertly, fast-paced, action-filled film that doesn't talk down to its audience. The true heart is the movie is the emotional moments. It's apparent that Bruce has an anger issue. He's plagued and has some of the poorest luck of superhero in any comic book film and because of that, he has become his own worst enemy, leading him to try and find a cue for his gift and always failing at it. The romantic stuff works well too. In Ang Lee's film, we never see a lot of romance between Bruce and Betty mainly because the story never requires it, but here, Bruce and Betty have more time to share on screen and it is used to great effect because while Banner may be invulnerable, but underneath beats the heart of a man who can not be with the woman he loves due to the gift that has been bestowed upon him.One of the things that sets this film apart from the 03' film is its wonderful visual effects with this Hulk looking more updated, elegant and realistic as opposed to the 03' Hulk that looked more like Shrek. While there are those who might complain about Bruce's transformation into the Hulk being mostly done in the dark, it does prove to be effective in building expectations and amplifying tension as ton when Hulk finally shows up in full grandeur. The action set pieces are also fantastic and while there only three in the movie, they last quite a while and gives the viewer heart-stopping action with the battle between the army and the Hulk bringing spectacularly deafening mayhem and the final show down in New York City between The Hulk and the Abomination making your inner kid giggle with joy along with hearing the words 'Hulk Smash!' which is sure to spend a chill running down your back.As for the actors, they are just fantastic: Edward Norton plays a far superior Bruce Banner/Hulk than Eric Bana due to Edward being much more convincing as a scrawny, geeky scientist while also exemplifying the agony and fight his character must endure by always being on the run, hiding and trying to find cue for the monster within him. Liv Tyler does a great job playing Bruce's love interest, Betty Ross, capturing the unquestionable shame of a woman who can never be with the man she loves surprisingly well, not to mention she and Norton have great chemistry. William Hurt plays General Ross as a no-nonsense villain, representing a man preoccupied with controlling something even he doesn't understand. Tim Roth is unquestionably credible as Emil Blonksy, tottering on uselessness and is willing to sacrifice his soul for power. Tim Blake Nelson makes the character of Samuel Stern his own by filling him with an amusing amount of intelligent irresponsibility that flutters in the face of logic and common sense. Robert Downey Jr. even shows up at the end of the film to set up the future of the MCU. Lou Ferrigno also shows up as a cameo and provides the voice for the Hulk.All and all, I will say that The Incredible Hulk is fantastic and if Ang Lee's film disappointed you then be sure to give this one a watch, it's way better and a must see superhero movie.",10,2,3,22 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," An enjoyable pile of wasted thought.
","An enjoyable pile of wasted thought.In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. In 1998, my parents took me and my brother to see A Bug's Life and one of the trailers showing before the movie was a preview for a new Star Wars movie called Episode 1: The Phantom Menace and being the high fan of the series that I am, I was over the moon. I could not wait to see it and with every trailer, I saw of the movie, my excitement grew. So when we finally went to see it in the summer of 1999, I remember sitting back in my seat as the opening credits rolled and John Williams' score blasted in my face. Over the next two hours, I just gapped in wonderment or possibly boredom and by the time the movie ended, I was awestruck. I loved The Phantom Menace and I seem to remember that I saw it several more times over the course of the year but as I grew older, I began to hear Star Wars fans call the movie bad or unwatchable or that it didn't even feel like Star Wars and I was shocked at first and even a bit upset as I had never seen anything particularly wrong with it apart from its long-running time so I still held on to the film until I too began to adopt the same mindset as many of the other fans, However, in preparation for Star Wars: Episode 9 coming out later this year, I decided to rewatch the movie and see if I could at the very least find something to enjoy about it. After watching the film over the course of a few days, I came to the conclusion that The Phantom Menace is an enjoyable movie in terms of its visual effects, action, musical score and some of the acting but was seriously flawed in its attempts at humor, its bloated running time, its dialog and its unfocused story.The film begins with The Trade Federation ordering a blockade of the planet of Naboo. In response to this crisis, The Supreme Chancellor of the Senate sends two Jedi named Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to negotiate with the viceroy but upon learning who they are, the Federation tries to kill the Jedi. Both Jinn and Kenobi escape to the surface of the planet just as the Trade Federation begins their invasion. While on the planet, Qui-Gon rescues a Gungan named Jar Jar Brinks who leads the Jedi to the underwater city of Otoh Gunga where they are able to obtain transportation and a guide. Upon reaching the capital city of Naboo, the trio is able to rescue the queen named Padme Amidala from the Trade Federation and make their way to the royal starship and flee Naboo intending to head for the planet Coruscant. However, while trying to escape, their ship is damaged and the group is forced to land on the desert plant of Tatooine. While roaming the streets of Mos Espa looking for spare parts, they visit a shop run by Watto and his young slave, Anakin Skywalker. Qui-Gon feels a powerful presence of the Force within the boy and strongly believes that Anakin is the supposed Chosen One. Now, the group must find a way to get the parts they need for the ship as well as win Anakin's freedom while a dark figure looms in the shadows waiting to pounce.Given the amount of hype and high hopes the movie generated in the build-up to its release and how the original trilogy is still venerated to almost godly status, nothing less than the second coming was going to fail with both moviegoers and film critics. Now some people may think it's acceptable to say that The Phantom Menace failed to reach its goal of bringing Star Wars back on the big screen which I'm inclined to agree with. With that being said, some may feel a certain amount of affinity is towards the film is due, not enough to say that The Phantom Menace is somehow a great movie but just enough to contend that the reasonably basic and central failings of the film are hiding a few notable benefits. Now, by no means do these features make The Phantom Menace any better in my eyes, but they do make the end product a whole lot more interesting than what I saw on the screen in 1999. Now, given how much I adored The Phantom Menace as a kid, it is quite shocking how problematic the film is when I rewatched it but it's also interesting that the level of debate about the features that fans usually talk about are normally seen as crucial or critical issues. Often, it appears that these problems are simply skin-deep indicators of much more important and often bypassed issues. Much like any other film, there's always several easy targets for criticism that tend to eclipse level-headed discussions of the film.While The Phantom Menace does have a fair share of redeeming qualities, they just aren't enough to totally save the film even if some Star Wars fans tend to fixate their disdain on plot points or characters who may not deserve it. The most famous example of this is the character of Jar Jar Binks, the notorious comic relief character. Fans of Star Wars are always quick to judge Jar Jar as one of the film's major problems as he is pretty much a pointless character along for the ride as well as unwanted comic relief and while there's nothing wrong with having comical characters in a Star Wars movie so long as they serve the story, R2-D2 and C-3PO are the perfect example of this, Jar Jar's problem is that his moronic comical moments have nothing to balance them out. The way R2 and 3PO play off each other in the original trilogy feels natural because it plays out in the background of the larger story as well as enthralling the viewer on their own terms but with Jar Jar, his comedy is often so out in the open with his attempts to make the viewer laugh that it feels forced rather than engaging or funny. It feels like George is forcing Jar Jar into the movie at every possible opportunity by just having him tag along with the lead characters for no other purpose apart from using him as a comic punching bag and never once is it funny. There are many more problems that the character of Jar Jar Binks. Much like Skids and Mudflap from Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, Jar Jar is a terribly racist character, using any number of overdone jester troupes. He's labeled as a primeval life form and seems unable to speak English properly and instead speaks in an offensively bad Jamaican accent which would make Bob Marley roll in his grave but he's not the only insulting stereotypical character on display in The Phantom Menace as The Trade Federation Viceroy and his associates are obviously Asian stereotypes with the way they speak and their clothing while Watto with his love for money is an outdated and insulting portrayal of Jewish people.Another issue with The Phantom Menace is the poorly written characters and the non-existent arcs the characters have and what's even more upsetting is that Jar Jar is the most developed character in the film. Sure, Qui-Gon is an interesting character at certain points in The Phantom Menace but he has his own issues. There's simply no arcs for any of the lead heroes or villains in the film. Unlike the character development in the original trilogy with Luke or even Han Solo's growth from a space cowboy to a hero fighting for the common good, there's no growth for any of the characters in The Phantom Menace. Yeah, Padme tries to be the next version of Leia by chastising the good-for-nothing cad as Qui-Gon plays that role in the film, but she just isn't compelling and feels as charming as a tree stump not to mention there's no attraction between the two leads and the dialog that Lucas has written doesn't help them. Of course, The Phantom Menace also falters due to not having the roles of characters like Luke and Han to help drive the story along. I'm not discussing characters who are alike but rather story objectives that are alike. The character of Luke Skywalker gave us a window into an alien world of spiritualism in the original trilogy but in The Phantom Menace, we simply don't get that. As a matter of fact, all the wonder of the original Star Wars films now feels boring as if the characters just go with the flow in this movie There's also no formable supporting character like Han Solo although Qui-Gon does come close to being one. It's nigh impossible to discover an appealing rascal if one is a member of an elite class.Another issue here is that these compelling bits of hidden agendas are only able to casually hide the clear gap in the prequel trilogy's portrayal of Anakin Skywalker. A New Hope is still looked at as a prime example of the story point known as The Hero's Journey and has been lauded for its clarity when used in the film's storytelling which in turn makes it all the more infuriating that Lucas fails so badly here with telling the story. It's not just the main characters who don't any arcs but even the movie itself doesn't have one ether. The Phantom Menace ends with the blockade of Naboo ending and Anakin starting his Jedi training but there's no real finale. Attack of The Clones and Revenge of the Sith do fill in the gaps a little bit but what is the fallout of the blockade? Are the Republic and The Trade Federation still at war even though we clearly saw the viceroy get sent away in chains?! The viewer understands that there's some menacing person working within the Republic but we learn nothing else about it than what we were able to figure out in the original trilogy. In other words, if the first three Star Wars films were never made and we didn't know about Anakin Skywalker or that Palpatine was going to become Emperor, what would The Phantom Menace have accomplished in the end?It's quite curious that The Phantom Menace has such difficulties with its characters that referencing the first three Star Wars movies would seem almost blasphemous on the level",7,0,0,27 January 2019
Iron Man 3," Marvel's version of The Dark Knight Rises.
","After watching the first two Iron Man films and The Avengers, I thought that Iron Man 3 would be just more of the same with lots of action and not a lot of story. Man, was I wrong. Not only is this movie the best out of the Iron Man trilogy but it's also one of the best MCU movies period. From it's witting and humor to it's darker story and how it delves into the character of Tony Stark, Iron Man 3 is a truly phenomenal comic book movie.Following the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark has been suffering from PTSD and has been having nightmares as a result; meanwhile, America is under attack from a terrorist group led by The Mandarin and after Stark makes a threat to the fanatic on national TV, his entire world is destroyed and Tony must use his knowledge and inventiveness to rebuild his life and find those responsible.Rather then John Favreau directing this time, Shane Black takes over and brings a much darker tone to this film while managing to to juggle all the somber moments and the comical moments with ease while also showing us how we can create demons in our lives, but, we are also able to dig ourselves out of the messes that we create. I've heard a lot of people complaining that this film focuses too much on Stark and not enough on Iron Man, I personally like my superheroes to be more human and have depth to them, not just flying around in suits kicking ass all the time not to mention I loved seeing Tony step out of the suit and be a sincere person. The film does such an excellent job diving into Tony's psyche showing us the effects of the Battle of New York on Stark and how he's having a rough time handling all these new surprises like the presence of aliens and the fact that he's a superhero and is beginning to fear that without his suit, he's unable to protect those he loves from danger and as the movie moves along, he is required to use his brains and intellect to crush his opponents, and eventually, it is he who makes the suit not the other way around, echoing the worlds that Steve Rogers asked Tony in the Avengers that even without the armor, Tony is still Iron Man. I've also heard a lot of people complain about the Mandarin plot twist, personally I loved it and it worked really well because mostly because I went into the movie knowing almost nothing about what would happen so when the twist came at me, I was shocked but not in a negative way. The way the director and the writer had Killian produce a false extremist to frighten the whole country in order to lure interest away from himself but also to aid his own agenda is nothing short of mind-blowing and is easily one of the best plot twists since the I am your father twist from Empire Strikes Back.As with the first 2 movies, the cast is sport on: Gwyneth Paltrow is a fine contrast to RDJ as Pepper Potts, not to mention she gets to be in on the action rather than be a clichéd damsel in distress. Don Cheadle doesn't have a lot of screen time in the movie as Col. James Rhodes, but he still does a wonderful job and I loved how Black creates a Lethal Weapon type relationship between Rhodes and Stark. Jon Faverau is also wonderful as Happy Hogan. Guy Pearce is fabulous as Aldrich Killian and while he does come off as a little underwhelming at times, I found his performance quite threatening throughout the film. Even Ben Kingsley did a great job in this film, he is very intimidating when he's The Mandarin, but when it's revealed that he isn't the Afghan terrorist, Ben goes to town and he is clearly having a great time with the role, but it's Robert Downey Jr. who makes these movies worth watching. By now, Robert has become the personification of Tony Stark/Iron Man so much that I can't see any other actor playing this role but him. The persona that he injects into the character is perfect. The charisma, humor and charm that Downey brings to the role is a treat to watch and it adds an element to Iron Man that wouldn't be possible without him in the role.The visual effects are stunning, The musical score by Brian Tyler is truly fantastic by being much more foreboding then the previous Iron Man films, but is also much more musical, plus the main theme is a total joy to listen to. The humor is also wonderful and while a lot of people whined about that too, it makes the film a lot less dark and gloomy and more fun to watch particularly the banter between Stark and Harley Keener, and yet the humor never distracts from the more somber scenes and at the same time, always feels welcomed. While there isn't a lot of action in this movie when compared to the first two, there are some stand-out moments like a bold attack on Air Force 1 in mid-flight which leads to a thrilling action scene where Iron Man has to save several people floating in mid-air and fly them to safety. The other is at the end where we get to see all of Stark's suits in action.I will say that Iron Man 3 isn't the horrible movie all the nay-sayers have been labeling it as, I really loved this movie and the direction that it took with it's story and it's message. So, ignore the crybaby fanboys and give this movie a watch. It's certainly one of the best comic movies of the last few years.",10,14,22,28 April 2015
Star Trek," One of the few reboots that did what it needed to do.
","Growing up, I was never into Star Trek as I preferred the Star Wars films and it wasn't until I was older that my dad showed me a few episodes from the original 60s TV show did I become somewhat of a fan, but upon watching this reboot did I become a fan of Star Trek. From the visual effects to the acting and action, this movie just rocked! We open in the 23rd century where the Federation starship USS Kelvin is exploring an electric storm when a Romulan ship appears out of the storm and proceeds to assault the Kelvin. Captain Robau goes aboard to negotiate a ceasefire, but while on the other ship, Robau is killed by the ship's commander, Nero who resumes attacking the Kelvin. George Kirk manages to evacuate the ship's crew as well as his pregnant wife from the ship while he heads on a crash course with the Romulan ship and sacrifices his own life. 17 years later on the planet Vulcan, Spock is allowed to enroll in a Vulcan science academy, but enrolls in Starfleet instead. Kirk has become an irresponsible but bright young man; following a bar fight, James meets Captain Christopher Pike who urges him to join Star Fleet which Kirk does. After joining, Kirk is put on trial for cheating on the Kobayashi Meru test, but the trial is interrupted by a distress call from Vulcan. Now, Kirk and Spock must learn to work together and save the universe form the Romulans.Reinventing any movie franchise is never easy and Star Trek is no exception; however right when the movie starts, it becomes obvious that the old Star Trek timeline has been discontinued, many fans were unhappy with this but I think it gave the writers and Abrams a chance to give the franchise a breath of fresh air and while this isn't the Star Trek your parents grew up with, the film pays respect to the classic show, but it doesn't feel like a big tribute but rather flows with the whole legacy of Star Trek and the viewer doesn't need to have seen any of the other films in order to understand what is going on. The story feels fresh and new and provides a nice backstory for each member of the crew of the Enterprise and how they all come together not to mention each character is well-written and well-developed giving me a reason to care about them as the film progresses.The relationship between Kirk and Spock is fantastic and embodies the core presence in the movie. The two aren't friends when they first meet unlike in the TV show and frequently clash, but by the end, they do set aside their differences. The interactions between the main characters are far from embarrassing and each actor plays their part perfectly.Chris Pine is incredible as James T. Kirk, highlighting the arrogance and thoughtless of the character even better that Shatner and while Pine doesn't have the unusual speech display as William, you still see him as Kirk; there are even a few scenes where Chris resembles Shatner. The same can also be said for Zachary Quinto as Spock who is so convincing in the role that one can't help but be awestruck by his intelligence, his chilly and deliberate reason, and yet we do feel sympathy for him once he comes to grips with his human emotions and his scenes with Pine help us understand their loathing for each other. Karl Urban is perfect as Dr. Bones McCoy, conveying many of the same mannerisms DeForrest Kelly did in the original TV show from the way he speaks and his catch phrases to his brashness towards Spock make for an eerie similarity to Kelly's character. Anton Yelchin is delightful as Chekov and seems to be pulled straight out of the 60s show, complete with his inability to say the letter 'v' and his mathematical wizardry. Zoe Saldana as Uhura is fabulous and is scripted as a character with a brashness that shatters the norms of well-known Star Trek lore, not to mention she is a total bad-ass when it comes to the fighting. John Cho is a worthy successor to George Takei as Sulu, showing his prowess at the helm of the Enterprise and with a sword when in action. Simon Pegg is wonderful as Scotty, playing the high-spirited engineer with utmost gusto, running around the ship screaming like a crazy person. Eric Bana is truly frightening as Nero and skillfully plays the cruel, cold-hearted Romulan with little effort. Leonard Nemoy returns as Spock Prime which is a nice call-back to the original show and it truly is a joy to see him return to his iconic role when he gives the younger Spock advice on letting go of logic and allowing his emotions to dictate his actions.The visual and sound effects are truly something to write home about with all the sounds fitting the scenes they're used in while still retaining the classic Star Trek sounds with the beaming effect and the warp speed drive kicking in. The visual effects give a greater scoop and scale to space and the Federation and the design of the Enterprise is fabulous. The action is fast-paced and never lets up once during the entire film with the final shootout on the Romulan ship being the stand-out action scene for me.With JJ Abrams directing this movie, you can anticipate some edgy camera work along with some tasteful lens flairs which add to the practicality and greatness of the film and the camera-work shows a fine steadiness between being stable and being chaotic, and there are plenty of great camera movements in the movie. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is fantastic too.I really have no issues with this movie; it's a fun summer blockbuster that still feels like Star Trek and I highly recommend it.",10,1,3,21 July 2016
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Lords of the Rebellion.
","In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. After Revenge of the Sith came out, it seems that Star Wars as a film series was over. That was until 2012 when George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to the Walt Disney Company for 4 billion dollars and the studio announced that they would be making more films set in the Star Wars universe. One of these films would focus on a group of Rebels stealing the plans to the Death Star. When I first heard about the film, I was quite gritty about it and when the first teaser trailer for Rogue One: A Star Wars Story dropped in April of 2016, I was even more pumped to see it as it appeared that director Gareth Edwards would be taking a more serious approach to the series and give us something in the vein of Saving Private Ryan. Of course, when I did go see the film later that year, I was at first blown away by it but as I thought about it more and more, I began to love it less and upon rewatching it earlier this year in preparation for The Rise of Skywalker, my feelings on the film haven't really changed as while I find Rogue One: A Star Wars Story to be a highly enjoyable film thanks to its action scenes, acting and musical score, some elements of the film leave a lot to be desired in my eyes.The film opens with Imperial scientist Galen Erso hiding with his wife and daughter on the planet Lah'mu where Imperial weapons maker Orson Krennic finds him and begs him to help finish building the Empire's new superweapon, the Darth Star. Galen's wife is killed in the stand-off but his daughter, Jyn, escapes and is rescued by rebel extremist Saw Gerrera. We then cut to a defective Imperial cargo pilot named Bodi who is captured by Sal's extremist group of rebels on the desert planet of Jedha while carrying a message for Saw. Meanwhile, rebel intelligence officer Cassian Andor learns of the Death Star via another agent and rescues Jyn from an Imperial labor camp and brings her to the Rebel headquarters where Mon Mothma persuades Erso to aid in finding her father so that the Rebel Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Together with Andor and a reprogrammed Imperial droid named K-2SO, they head for Jedha. Now, the trio must find Galen, assemble a rag-tag team and steal the plans to the Death Star before it's too late.What's interesting about Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is how the film feels split between two frontiers. On one hand, it's a spectacular war film in the vein of Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down about a universe that is ensnared in disorder between a plucky rebel alliance and an evil imperial empire. Though the world of space fantasy, Rogue One is able to arouse the viewer with all sorts of fascinating ideas about the battle that is at the core of the Star Wars saga. What would a war in space look like in the 21st century? What is the viewpoint of this massive conflict from outside the cockpit of an X-Wing or the Millennium Falcon by those on the front lines or those people caught in the crossfire? These are just a few of the points that Rogue One focuses on as a war film that so happens to take place in the Star Wars universe.On the other hand, Rogue One does in some ways feel like a bunch of deleted scenes that intend to link the prequel films with the original Star Wars trilogy. The essential idea of Rogue One results in the stealing of the plans for the Death Star that move the plot of A New Hope which in theory should be enough to connect Rogue One to its parent. But much like Solo: A Star War Story, Rogue One feels the need to pepper the screen with various cameos and callbacks to previous Star Wars films in order to pander to the hard-core Star Wars fans. Much like Solo: A Star Wars Story, some of the Easter eggs and callbacks work in the film's favor but others just feel tacked on and don't add anything to the story at hand. So, Rogue One feels imprisoned in-between being a thrilling look at a familiar film series with a new perspective while at the same time feeling a bit too much like Star Wars fan fiction. It's no shock that the war angle of the movie is far more interesting than the fan fiction angle.The most compelling element of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is the bold promise of the entire film. With it not being a main chapter in the Star Wars saga, there's a feeling that Rogue One is able to have a bit of fun with one of the most beloved movie franchises ever put to screen. It can acquire the current framework that the previous Star Wars films have built and undo or question what has already been established. Think of a spy film set within the Star Wars universe starring Jyn, Cassian, and K2 or a heist movie on a grand scale. Envision seeing the Star Wars saga without the Jedi and Sith playing a central part in the story. That is the kind of film Rogue One is.Words can not explain how much Star Wars has become engrained into our culture since 1977 and the fact that most of us know the saga inside and out, even the most casual of moviegoers know of the iconic imagery and mythology that the saga has given us over the past 42 years. People who don't go to the movies that much sometimes hum the opening Star Wars theme like a Beatles song. Yoda and Darth Vader are the go-to for Star Wars imitations that are the easiest to read even if the impressions themselves may be awful. So the Star Wars saga is as much apart of our culture as Coca Cola and is something that lends itself to being tampered with. Unlike some people who think the saga should be preserved in glass and put on display, I have always felt that's room in the franchise for improvement and exploring new worlds and characters. Sure, the Star Wars films do invite moviegoers of all ages to admire and be wowed by pure wonder and ask questions but the true delight of watching the saga that George Lucas created is the ability with which a single line of dialog can lead to endless hours of discussion between moviegoers and fans alike. The universe of Star Wars is so vast and endless in scope and yet so flawlessly created. When watching a Star Wars film, it's always fun to picture yourself dancing below the raindrops of continuity or recalling images of a pop art depiction of 2001: A Space Odyssey to Star Wars.Certainly, that was perhaps the best part of the controversial plan by Disney to scarp the Expanded Universe and start over and by doing so, had erased several decades of novels, comics and video games that were built around the films. Now, it must be stressed that what has been tossed out of the new Star Wars canon doesn't mean that the books about Thrawn or Prince Xizor should cease to exist simply because Disney doesn't consider those stories part of their Star Wars universe. The stories are still there and the fans who love those stories can still love them and even Lucasfilm has been using elements of the EU in the more recent comics and TV shows so it's not like the EU has been snapped out of existence. As for me, while I did read some EU stories when I was younger, I never cared for it nor do I care for the new Star Wars canon mostly because I see them both as simply filling in the gaps before, between and after the films. When writing fan-fiction, the urge is to focus on building a universe from the inside instead of the outside as there's always a passion to link every important event or character to a slice of the continuity pie. Taking out all of the material that isn't considered to be apart of the canon allows the creative team to put their own stamp on certain events.There's a ton in Rogue One that works perfectly in that respect. There are quite a few points that Gareth Edwards seems content to set free of the assumptions of a big blockbuster film. Right when it starts, Rogue One gives us a multitude of considerable ritualistic shifts from various tropes found in the other Star Wars films. The opening score sounds much different than the John Williams fanfare that usually opens the other films and there's no title card or text scroll as well as on-screen captions that show the various planets rather than having them explained to us. These departures from what we're used to seeing in the other Star Wars films are small but still critical. Over the course of the first hour of the film, Edwards gives the viewer his own touch to the greater Star Wars universe. This is a film that is steadily rooted in the background characters with none of them being a chosen farm boy or princess but rather mere footnotes in the lager Star Wars universe. In this regard, Rogue One builds upon the storytelling choices that The Force Awakens had already established.At its finest, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story gives us a view of the Star Wars universe for the ground floor. The film includes all sorts of classic Star Wars icons but the scoop and scale are so much more massive than what we've seen before. These affairs and clashes seem to happen on multiple levels above the heads of our main characters. The Death Star and the threat it presents itself as are what drives the story with different forms and descriptions of the battle station have shown up in four of the seven Star Wars films, however, Rogue One still finds a way to make the superweapon look intimidating and epic at the same time. The film looks at the Death Star from the surface of Jedha. At one point in the film, the weapon appears over the surface of the planet like a moon while another time, the Death Star places itself as if it's eclipsing the sun. When it does fire its laser, the viewer doesn't see the destruction from the freezing vacuum of space but rather they see",9,2,2,30 October 2019
Iron Man 2," Summer entertainment at its finest
","After watching the first Iron Man and enjoying it, I thought that the second would be mediocre at best. Well, I can honestly say that didn't happen because I found Iron Man 2 be just as fun and action-packed as the first one.The film starts off very nicely, with recordings from the end of the first film where Tony Stark tells the media that he is the man in the iron suit. The scene then cuts to Russia where we're introduced to our villain, Ivan Vanko watching his father dying. It appears that his father, Anton used to work with Tony's father, Howard, and somewhere down the road, Howard seized Anton's ideas and booted him to the curb and for this, Ivan swears revenge on Stark. Meanwhile, the palladium core of Tony's arc reactor that keeps him alive is slowly killing him and he can't find an alternate. He begins to become increasingly irresponsible and downhearted about his looming demise, and decides not to tell anyone about his ailment and appoints Pepper Pots as the CEO of Stark Industries and employs Natalie Rushman as his personal assistant. While racing in the Monaco Grand Prix, Tony is attacked by Vanko, but is able to fight him off. Now, Stark must get his life back together, build a new reactor and stop Vanko.While most sequels try to up the ante, Iron Man 2 comes across as a brisk and harmless film that meanders along at an attractive clip, with emotional discomfort a distant thought which is very refreshing. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the total opposite of some other comic book films. For example, it's definitely not darker than the first Iron Man and also gives itself artistic freedom to extend on the impossible. Common sense simply does not work here and Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux have a lot of freedom with the chines of reality. While the first Iron Man was an origins story, the sequel had no lack of possible roads to take, so it decided to go with the characterization road and instead of developing its universe, the movie merely takes it's cast of characters and tosses them into circumstances grimmer than before, upping the stakes but at the same time echoing the spirit of the first one. The characters are well written, each quick conversation decided with a mature bleakness that differentiates from the illegitimate situations that the film features and while the movie could be labeled as a comedy, but the humor flows so perfectly that you get the sense that it would be out of the question to write this film and not have these characters joke with one another. There are a number of themes in this movie, the most notable one being one's legacy, of what we pass on when we pass away; the impact on those who follow us and how the consequences of past actions can ricochet down the line long after someone passes on.The visual effects in this film are fantastic with lots of explosions, ear-jolting sound effects, stunning camera techniques and cinematography to keep the audience focused. As for the action, there's only a few scenes, but they all bring a lot to the movie by bringing the viewer a ton of excitement and delight, especially the finale, a 30 minute visual feast for the eyes and senses of Iron Man and War Machine battling Whiplash and his drones, which left me hungry for more. The soundtrack is darker than the first film and has some outstanding tracks along with a great soundtrack with songs by Daft Punk, Queen, and AC/DC.The acting is incredible just as it was in the first film: Gwyneth Paltrow once again proves herself as Pepper Potts, bringing a lot of sadness to the role, but is by no means a damsel in distress, not to mention she and Downey have wonderful chemistry, Jon Favreau returns as Happy Hogan and gets to have more fun in the movie rather than just staying behind the camera, Sam Jackson pops up again as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Nick Fury sowing the seeds for later MCU films. Don Cheadle picks up right where Terrance Howard left off in the first Iron Man as Rhodey/ War Machine, stepping into the role with certainty and proves himself to be superior to Howard. Scarlett Johansson is awesome as Black Widow, proving she is more than capable of being in an action film and while she isn't on screen for much of the movie, her flight scene in the hall does leave an impact. The villains of the film as just as important as our heroes and they don't disappoint with Mickey Rourke adding a combination of a contrived show person, arrogant mastermind and an overpowering monster, while perfectly personifying Vanko's rude visage while Sam Rockwell is complete comic fodder as Tony's business rival, Justin Hammer. Rockwell kills it in this role and is a joy to watch, either when he's losing his temper with Vanko or awarding his own creations with childish enthusiasm. But the true heart and soul of Iron Man 2 comes from Robert Downey Jr. He is the mind, heart and spirit of the man in the iron suit which makes me think if the film was written especially for him. When it comes to Stark's vain personality and sarcasm, he also shines there too, providing us with a ton of great quips and laugh-out-lord moments and while Downey does portray a selfish, egotistical playboy; he is still a likable character. Much like the first one, RDJ is and will always be Iron Man.All and all, Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to the first film, proving us with more of what we loved with more action, humor, a killer soundtrack, stellar performances and a great story. Definitely give this film a watch, you'll have a blast.",10,3,4,23 February 2015
World War Z," Dumbed down and disappointing
","Back in the summer of 2013, I and a group of friends went to our local theater and we decided to see World War Z, I had seen a few trailers and it did look good, so I went in with an open mind. Needless to say, when I left the theater, I was massively disappointed. From its weak story and characters to its numerous plot holes, World War Z is a truly bad summer blockbuster.The film begins with a retired CIA agent named Gerry Lane living a peaceful life with his wife and kids when a zombie epidemic hits Philadelphia and forces the family to seek shelter in Newark, there Gerry's old CIA friend, General Umuntoi arranges their rescue, but the house is invaded by zombies and they barley manage to it make out and are then transferred to a carrier group anchored off New York City. Now, Gerry must travel the globe to find a cure and stop the zombie epidemic.Although I've never read the book that the movie is based off, I'm surprised the most fascinating elements of the book that weren't included in the movie were the exploration of how the zombie outbreak touches social and governmental foundations around the globe, but since Paramount and Marc Foster wanted to go for a more generic action movie, all the interesting ideas that the book had got tossed out the window and the PG-13 rating reflects that by throwing all the things that have become the trademarks of the zombie genre into something more watered down for family audiences and the action scenes that we do see in the movie are incredibly unsatisfying.I'm flabbergasted by how cheap the film looks considering the 190 million it took to make, but when you watch the movie, it's hard to tell where all that money went because the zombies look incredibly fake and given the movie's desire to stay away from blood and gore, the only features that divide these zombies from people are cloudy eyes, gray skin and an affinity for showing and snapping their teeth. These aren't the hungry for brains zombies that we see in many other zombie movies and when viewed from afar, it's difficult to tell the zombies from actual people but even later on when they are shown in their passive state, it really shows how little the filmmakers know about how zombies work. The lurching and shrieks are intended to be frightening; however they come across as more comical than anything else with their teeth clicking, head banging and jerking resulting in some unintentionally funny moments.Much like The Patriot, none of World War Z's characters are written well or have any complexities leaving us to not care if they live or die. Brad Pitt's character is a happy family man which is not only unoriginal but it fails to make him likable not to mention his marriage and daughters feel incredibly fake and ready-made that if Brad was ripped apart piece by piece by zombies in front of his family, it wouldn't have made any difference. The other characters are no better, just showing up when the plot requires they do or they serve no purpose to the overall story like a neurologist who does nothing but spout tasteless allegories about the weather or a group of soldiers devoid of any personality that it's impossible to feel any sympathy for them when they die. There are numerous plot-holes in the film too: Zombies are able to identify a fatal illness just by gazing at a person and will evade that person for unknown reasons which make no sense, if a doctor with years of therapeutic education can't be able to do that without extensive experimenting then how would a mindless zombie be able to figure it out and second, why in the hell would a zombie avoid an ill person? The World Health Organization in Wales has a baseball bat in its weapons vault, does Marc Forster not know where Wales is, and were there no cricket bats around? The cell phone battery is proclaimed dead, yet in a later scene, it's working again. Seriously, Foster, seriously?! When the team decides to regain the aliment samples, they don't give Brad any instructions about what containers have what inside, but evidently one container is full of stuff that could kill him instantly. Really, really?! Also, Brad has no combat skills, leadership skills nor is he a doctor in this movie so why is he being tasked with leading this mission when there are far more qualified men then him? It doesn't make any sense.Of course, I have to bring up the ending. Just when you think the plot can't get any worse, the film takes a down-hill slide in the last 40 minutes. We see Brad playing hide-and-seek with the zombies. There's absolutely no tension because the ending is declared 5 minutes into the scene, Brad goes to the part of the building that's crawling with zombies, get some aliment samples and return. They'll use one to contaminate themselves and see how the zombies will react. They of course don't, and Brad returns to his family and with a hollow speech about this isn't the end but only the beginning, one of the weakest movie endings ever in the history of cinema.Now, is there anything good in this incoherent mess of celluloid? Well, Brad Pitt is great in it and while I'll say that this isn't his best movie, he's in no way bad or even just run-of-the-mill, he's great for this kind of role and he pulls it off quite well even if his character wasn't interesting or likable. The other actors are trying, but the script doesn't allow them to be as good as they could have been. But outside of that, World War Z isn't worth your time. Go watch Dawn of the Dead or the Walking Dead instead.",2,4,7,23 January 2017
Zootopia," Disney just keeps getting better and better.
","Ever since they released The Princess and The Frog in 2009, Disney has been enjoying a new renaissance in animation resulting in films like Frozen and Big Hero 6, so when I heard that the House of Mouse were making a film about anthropomorphic animals, my curiously peaked and I went to see it just recently and I must say, this movie was fantastic, from it's beautiful animation and great voice acting to it's morals, everything work perfectly. Zootopia is a movie so well-timed and appropriate, it's almost shocking. At a time when madness, hatefulness, and paranoia have been implanted into the minds of the general public by those who should be battling against it, a movie like this comes along to help us rise above modest-minded claims and stereotypes of other people.The film takes place in the lively, varied world of Zootopia, a place where both predator and prey live in harmony, and are free to be whoever and whatever they choose. These are the reasons that draw Judy Hopps, a small town rabbit with dreams of becoming a police officer, something her parents fear because not only has there never been a rabbit police officer, but they also feel that Judy should keep her ambitions to selling carrots which is the last thing Judy has on her mind. Upon completing her police training, Judy is then pushed into the force with a lot of muscular animals. Her boss, Chief Bogo forces her to be a meter maid while the other cops handle the big cases in order to keep Judy in her place, until he tasks her with finding a missing otter within 48 hours. Judy then enlists the help of a fox named Nick Wilde after getting him to work with her. Together, they must work to find the missing otter, but uncover something far bigger.This movie wears it's meanings on its sleeves, but in not a way that sidetracks from or dilutes its main themes. Two of those being sexism and racism, characteristics of our society that are unlikely to disappear from the Earth, but should never be used as forces of hate. The writers have carefully built a world and within that world, filled it with a variety of animals, some branded as ideal while others are branded as the opponent that many are just waiting for to step out of line. When you watch the movie, it doesn't take a scientist or doctor to tell you that Judy Hopps represents woman while the predators represent minorities.The story is always well placed and connecting and is told with such vigor, magic and emotion that some watching the film will forget the story being a bit on the predicable side. Jared Bush and Paul Johnson have penned the film carefully, but to the point where ignoring the message just isn't an option and while countless other animated movies have preached the messages of loving your neighbor and tolerance, few have perfected it as well as Zootopia has. Not since Hunchback of Notre Dame has Disney dealt with such weighty themes, but deals with those themes with a light handle.Rather than staying with a smartly story-boarded, complex narrative, the writers had no issue having fun with the film, permitting Judy and Nick to wander without restrains in a giant city and allowing informal/situational humor to take it's course which is why we have a hysterical scene with three-toed sloths at the DMV as well as a wink-and you'll-miss-it pursuit scene between Judy Hopps and a weasel or a great Godfather parody scene. The movie isn't short on ideas nor is it short on get-up-and-go and the noteworthy thing is how the film goes at 100 miles an hour in every area and doesn't even come close to stopping by the end credits. The film also has some incredibly smart and humorous writing, cunningly pairing crafty references and clever humor along with honest emotions and heart without any embarrassing tone shifts along with the visual humor which is also a joy to behold.As for the animation in Zootopia, it's never looked better with vivid colors, beautifully designed backgrounds and lovingly drawn characters whose movements are fluid and never move in a robotic fashion. Some of the animation is very imaginative in its set pieces too. The musical score by Michael Giacchino is skillfully crafted and orchestrated, full of energy, and memorable and complements the movie nicely.The characters in Zootopia are all interesting and all have a purpose in the movie with interesting personalities, none of which feel lackluster, shoehorned in, irritating or pointless which is great to see in a Disney film. Judy Hopps is a perfect Disney role model for people, never giving up her dreams when talked down to by others, and is passionate about making the world a better place, not to mention the excellent job Ginnifer Goodwin does bringing Judy's voice to life. Jason Bateman is great as Nick Wilde who starts off as a jerk, but does have a back story much like Judy that gives him some development and makes Nick much more relatable, plus the chemistry between them is incredible to watch. Idris Elba is awesome as Chef Bogo; J.K Simmons rocks it as Mayor Lionheart, Maurice LaMarche's Mr. Big is a hilarious Mafia like Arctic shrew crime boss who steals every scene he's is; Nate Torrance is tremendously delightful as Officer Clawhauser right from the moment we are introduced to him. Flash, the three-toed sloth working at the DMV is also an extremely hilarious character voiced by Simpsons director Raymond S. Persi. Even Latino singer, Shakira provides her voice here and does a great job and her song 'Try 'Everything' helps to push the morals of the film pretty well.I can't say enough about how much I loved Zootopia, it's an absolutely flawless Disney animated film with something for everybody. Go see it now, you'll love it!",10,1,5,19 May 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," A nearly perfect sequel to an already great film.
","After seeing the first Star Trek film and loving it, I was excited to see Star Trek: Into Darkness and after watching it, I can say that while it does have problems, I still loved this film just as much as the first one due to the tone, visual effects, acting, and action.The film opens with Captain Kirk and Dr. Bones escaping hostile natives on the planet Nibiru, but they give away their presence to the natives and as a result, Kirk is removed from command of the Enterprise and Admiral Pike is put in command instead with Kirk being reduced to a commander and Spock is relocated to another ship. Afterwards, a Starfleet turncoat named John Harrison attacks the Section 31 building in London and soon after attacks Starfleet headquarters, killing Pike and several high-ranking officers. Admiral Alexander Marcus recalls Kirk and Spock to the Enterprise with orders to find and kill Harrison only to find out that Harrison is more than what he seems.When it comes to making a tentpole summer blockbuster like this, it doesn't need to have a lot of mind-numbing, grating trash; something Abrams, the writers and everyone else involved strived to give us a film that much like the first film feels renewed and persistently thrilling, but doesn't deviate from the story and characters. The Star Trek series has a wonderful legacy for the past 50 years and as a result, has had a massive impact on the science fiction genre and to just throw all that history and legacy away for something with all flash and no soul would be seen as a crime of sorts, but with Star Trek: Into Darkness; that is clearly not the case. Sure, once the film starts, there seems to be hardly any time to stop and slow down, but when it does take time to slow down just enough time for us to dig deeper into the characters' personas and what is happening aboard the Enterprise, making it easy to remain invested throughout the 2-hour run time which moves so much more quicker.The story does allow time for emotional things like the relationships between the characters such as Spock and Uhura, and the willingness to sacrifice one's life in order to save others. As with the first film, there is a fair amount of character development especially with Kirk learning to be more humble and what being a hero is all about and Spock is still battling with his human and Vulcan sides, but as the film progresses, he learns to be more in touch with his emotions and he and Kirk grow to appreciate each other better with Kirk learning how to obey and follow orders and Spock learns how to be expressive and reckless.The film also delves into the topic of the perils of a military leader with too much power, the dishonesty and clandestineness used by said leader, the extent he is willing to go, giving raise to the likelihood of a military dictator. The similarities between the state of the world today and what is presented in this movie makes for an interesting study such as the scene where Harrison is awakened or when Scotty protests the usage of unapproved torpedoes and accused of defying orders and although the viewer can concur that Scotty is right in his actions to provide aid in deterring the events of the film as they progress, even though he is aware that he will be arrested for disloyalty for his actions which raises the question of is there ever a time when betrayal is appropriate? Much like the first one, the visual and sound effects are fantastic with the same sounds the original 60s show used like the beaming effect and the sound of the warp drive while the visual effects give a far greater scoop to the world of Star Trek and showcases a variety of different planets that all differ in technology and culture and the effects really show that here. JJ adds more lens flares which add a nice dash of style to the final film.Of course, this film would be nothing without its actors and they all deliver here. Chris Pine once again nails it as Captain Kirk by coming into his own as a leader and yet retraining the womanizing, hot-headed, arrogant attitude that we have come to expect and love and has made the role of Captain Kirk his own. Zachary Quinto continues to knock it out of the park as Spock by being the ground for Kirk to stand upon and the interactions between Pine and Quinto is just perfect. Karl Urban is once again fantastic as Bones, channeling DeForest Kelly's habits and persona so perfectly as well as having some great one-liners. Anton Yelchin is wonderful as Chekov, John Cho continues to impress as Sulu, Zoe Saldana rocks it as Uhura and Simon Pegg has never been better as Scotty. Peter Weller puts in a great performance as Admiral Marcus and Alice Eve plays Carol Marcus very well. Of course, the true star of the movie is Benedict Cumberbatch as John Harrison/Khan and it goes without saying that he delivers in this movie. Cumberbatch is such an enthralling actor who recognizes how much screen time to chew up without coming across as silly and his cleverness and physical power make him more than a match for the Enterprise crew and his performance of vacant expressions and motionless eyes make for a truly chilling performance.Now, the movie does have its share of problems like at times, it does rip off Wrath of Khan in a few scenes and it really didn't make sense to just kill Kirk off and bring him back a scene later, but in spite of all that, I really did love this movie. It's certainly worth watching even you're not a fan of Star Trek.",10,3,9,3 December 2016
Spider-Man 2," The gold standard for a Marvel movie
","Now, I never saw Spiderman 2 in theaters as I didn't much care for comic book movies at that time, but earlier this year, I finally decided to watch it and see it for myself and lo and behold, I loved it. From it's solid directing and themes about choice to it's action scenes and performances, Spiderman 2 is a truly wonderful superhero movie.The movie begins with Peter Parker finding himself being torn between his duties as Spiderman and holding down a job. All the while he's failing in school, his aunt is facing eviction from her home and Peter has become alienated from Mary Jane as well as Harry Osborne. Harry funds a fusion experiment by scientist Otto Octavius, unfortunately the experiment goes haywire and kills Otto's wife causing him to go insane. Later on, Mary Jane getting engaged and Harry snapping at him causes Peter to suffer an emotional breakdown which also causes him to lose his powers and he quits being Spiderman. His life then begins to improve, but when Doctor Octopus remerges, Peter now must learn what it means to have great power and reasonability.When it comes to sequels, there are only a handful that are able to take what made the first one so great and amplify it to such a degree that it's able to surpass it's predecessor in every possible way, Spiderman 2 is one of those movies. Much like what Bryan Singer did with X-Men 2 or what Nolan did with The Dark Knight, Sam Raimi delivers to us a jewel of a superhero film, effortlessly matching if not improving on the first one in terms of story, character development and action. Unlike some sequels that tend to have a very poor plot that is often covered up by an overlord of action and poorly written characters that serve no purpose to the story, here we spend more time with Peter and see the strain that being Spiderman has put on his relationships with his friends and family, his job and his grades which further makes Peter all the more sympathetic and relatable, allowing us to care more about him and see him grow as a character while Dr. Octopus isn't a power-hungry villain just for the sake of it but rather a tragic villain who has lost everything he cares about which also makes him a much more relatable character. With the directorial freedom given to him, Sam Raimi is able to direct the movie with his usual eccentric style of directing and a personal touch that gives the film an extra layer of depth that permeates the film more so than the first one by using filming methods like having a certain scene cut to black save for the eyes of Spiderman's suit being used as a scene change or using the camera to accomplish a fading effect when showing us Doctor Octopus's continuing descent into madness and while such licenses taken may cause some to cry foul play, Raimi is able to find a way to incorporate them in such a way that makes it click. The action in Spider-Man 2 is truly fantastic and put the fight scenes in the first movie to shame in terms of momentum and exhilaration while it also looks a lot less cartoonish and more realistic and grounded but still maintain the same visual look the first one has. Raimi certainly knows how to direct action and Spiderman 2 shows that in a fantastic way, the battle in the bank is truly a masterstroke of pacing and energy while the battle on the train just might be one of the finest action scenes ever to be made for a superhero movie thanks to it's stakes, timing and emotional impact while the visual effects look seamless with Spidy swinging though New York while Doc Ock's tentacles allows the effects people to have some fun and while the arms are supposedly half CGI and half live action, they still look amazing. As with the first film, the cast is absolutory fantastic and everybody plays their role to perfection. James Franco is truly amazing as Harry Osborne, depicting him as a man filled with vengeance and trying to live up to what his father was yet we also see Harry conflicted when he unmasks Spiderman and sees Peter which makes for some great character moments and Franco does such a fantastic job conveying all of his emotional movements compellingly allowing the viewer to care about him more and showing his growth as an actor. Rosemary Harris continues to impress with her role as Aunt May by injecting a lot more sprit into her character and her pep talk to Peter is one of the most inspiring moments in any comic book movie while J.K. Simmons continues to steal every scene he's in as the hotheaded and self-centered J. Jonah Jameson while Kirsten Dunst is wonderful as Mary Jane and gives a great performance plus her and Toby have great chemistry that seems to seep off the screen. Much like Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Pratt, Maguire brings a level of good-heartiness, compassion and fearfulness to the role of Peter Parker and Spiderman, but his performance is most heart-wrenching during his moments of hesitation when he slows down and grasps what's going on around him, Maguire's performance truly shines but he also skillfully portrays both the nerdy heroic sides of the character with astonishing ease, easily one of the best superhero portrayals ever seen on screen. However, it's Alfred Molina as Doctor Otto Octavius who steals the movie in what could have been an over-the-top cartoonish performance but becomes a genuine and captivating performance thanks to Molina. By showing us a few scenes with Octavius and his wife, we see that he isn't nessacerly evil but rather determined to see his dream become a reality. Honestly, what else is there to say? Go watch Spiderman 2 now!",10,2,4,6 March 2018
Finding Nemo," Everything that a family film should be.
","Back in the summer of 03', my mom took me to see Finding Nemo and I remember being wowed by the animation, but now that I'm watching it again, I find myself loving the story, the humor and the morals so much more.The film opens with a glorious shot of the open ocean with two clownfish named Marlin and Coral appreciating their new home when a barracuda attacks them, knocking Marin out and eating Coral and almost all their eggs expect one that Marlin names Nemo. As the result of this traumatic event, Marin has become overprotective of his son and while on a school field trip, Nemo is kidnapped by scuba drivers. Marin then sets out to find his son, teaming up with a forgetful yet friendly blue tang named Dory. Along the way they encounter vegetarian sharks, a forest of jelly fish, chilled out sea turtles and hungry seagulls.The story in Finding Nemo uses the same blueprint Toy Story used, where two characters, one being tense and the other being naïve are hurled into a situation and are compelled to undertake this journey through a realm with animals that know a lot more than the humans in the movie are aware of.Pixar has always done a great job bringing complexly to each of their characters. They aren't made silly just for the sake of being silly. Their habits are often characteristic of an actual emotional disruption in their character. Marlin isn't portrayed as the nervous, restricting father just because the story demands it, we are shown the reason why he is that way in the opening scene. Dory isn't just the jokey sidekick just for the sake of comedy as we are provided a glance of the isolated, terrified character beneath her scales. The movie does give us a unique character in Dory by giving her short-term memory loss and while giving a cartoon character an actual disorder would seem dicey, the filmmakers encompassed it so well that it adds to the final film strengthening the relationships between our main characters. If Dory is the jokey sidekick than Marlin is the one who carries the film and as the film progressed, I was more curious about Marlin's fate and what he would learn. His continuous worrying makes perfect sense with his wife's passing and with his son missing, Marlin is mindful of the amount of endangerment he is in, but Dory is always there to offset Marlin's gloom.The animation here is gorgeous with the Pixar team really going out of their way to build an underwater world in this film with a vivid coral reef bursting with life while the sequences above the waves have a very photo-realistic look to them while the way the fish move and swim is incredibly realistic and stick to the actual displays of fish movement from Dory swimming in brief bursts to Marlin swimming with his tail, using his fins in an interchanging shape.The music is imaginative and has a little bit of a dreamlike feature to it like when Marlin loses sight of the boat or at the start of the movie.When it comes to themes, Finding Nemo has plenty and while some may see the film's theme as insubstantial, I found it to be quite touching. The themes of courage, friendship and letting your kids grow up all hit a nerve with us all because we all have been there at one point in our lives when we've faced the impossible or we've had to let someone go that we love and the film handles each of these themes brilliantly.When it comes to the voice acting, Finding Nemo definitely delivers in that area. Albert Brooks was destined to play Marlin, portraying him with the utmost sense of paranoia and sadness and yet is quite capable of showing love and compassion for his son when the scene calls for it. Ellen DeGeneres is a laugh riot as Dory, the idiot genus of the film and provides some of the best laughs, but also shows a lot of emotion throughout the film especially the scene where Marlin is about to leave and Dory pleads for him not to go because being around him helps her remember. The scene is heart-breaking and complex and Ellen plays it so well. Alexander Gould succeeds in bringing a lot of personality to the character of Nemo as the film progresses and he grows and learns about what he is capable of doing. Geoffrey Rush is a great addition to the cast as Nigel the pelican and is incredibly hilarious. Willem Defoe is awesome as Gill; giving Nemo the strength to stand on his own fins. Brad Garret is funny as Bloat, the pufferfish; Allison Jenny has some great lines as Peach the starfish, Austin Pendleton, Vicki Lewis and Joe Ranft all have their moments as Bubbles, Deb and Jacques. Bob Peterson is memorable as Mr. Ray. Director Andrew Stanton is awesome as the sea turtle, Crash with his chilled out mannerisms and relaxed way of speaking; it's difficult not to like him. When it comes to the humor, Finding Nemo has you covered while some family films have a tendency to have humor that only the kids will laugh at or won't get at all. A lot of the humor and jokes are cleverly done such as the group of sharks that resemble an Alcohol Anonymous group which adds some extra hilarity when Bruce catches a whiff of blood and the other two yell 'Intervention!', Dory attempting to speak whale or mistaking Marlin for her conscience make for some extremely laugh-out-loud moments.I really don't have anything more to that hasn't already been said about this movie. It's just perfect on every level. So, if you haven't seen this yet, go see it now. It's a true marvel and it might make you teary-eyed in a few scenes.",10,0,1,17 July 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," A guilty pleasure.
","Following the success of X-Men 3: The Last Stand, it was only a matter of time before 20th Century Fox would greenlight a spin-off movie featuring the X-Men's most popular character, Wolverine. With Gavin Hood who had already directed the Oscar-winning film, Tsotsi directing along with a script written by David Benioff and featuring the likes of Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber and Ryan Reynolds, X-Men Origins: Wolverine was shaping up to be a great movie. However, it was overseen by Fox chairman, Tom Rothman. Known for his dislike of genre movies, Rothman was determined to destroy Hood's vision at every turn. The two crashed continuously over the direction of the movie as Hood wanted a more dark and gloomy movie in line with the comics while Rothman wanted a fast-paced and kid-friendly film that would pull in high returns akin to the MCU. This got so bad that Hood apparently left the production of the film after Rothman repainted an entire set. With no one to finish shooting the movie, an unnamed ghost director was brought in, supposedly Richard Donner. The final film did perform well at the box office despite a workprint being leaked online but the critical and fan reactions were far from kind and the movie represents a dark spot on the resumes of all of those evolved. Now, my first exposure to X-Men Origins: Wolverine came when I first saw a few TV spots for it back in the spring of 09' and while I was impressed by what I saw, I decided to pass on seeing it as comic book movies weren't my thing back in those days. I didn't watch the film until late in 2016 in preparation for seeing Logan so I watched the movie and to my surprise, I didn't find it to be nearly as awful as some of the fans had labeled it as there were certain things I enjoyed like the action scenes and some of the acting, but the story, writing, characters, and tone left a lot to be desired in my eyes.The film starts in 1845 where we met young James Howlett who witnesses his supposed father being murdered by a groundskeeper. The angst caused by this activated Howlett's mutation where bone claws grow from the boy's knuckles and he straight-up kills the man only to have the groundskeeper reveal that he is James's biological father. Soon after, Howlett fees with the help of his half-brother, Victor Creed. The two spend the next century fighting in The Civil War, both World Wars and The Vietnam War where Victor is arrested for attempting to abuse a woman and he and James are thrown in jail. They are then approached by Major William Stryker and are offered membership in a mutant team. The two join the group for a few years but after seeing the group's as well as Victor's lack of compassion for human life, Logan quits the group and leaves. The film then skips ahead 6 years later where Wolverine now has a girlfriend and works as a logger. Later, Stryker approaches him and asks for his help in stopping Victor but Logan isn't interested until his girlfriend is killed. Now, Wolverine must find and kill Victor to avenge his girlfriend's death while Striker is working on a potently deadly experiment.With all the production troubles the movie was subjected to and how the final film was received by the general public and professional critics, X-Men Origins: Wolverine comes across as more of a haphazard attempt to tell the backstory of the most popular character in the entire X-men roster rather than trying to tell a compelling and complex story which should be the focal point of any movie but due to the various reshoots the film went through, it seems that what we got was very slapdash and poorly put together. Much like another superhero film released in 2009, Watchmen, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a film that comes along to surely pander to people who aren't familiar with the character or his source material. But in spite of that, the film, unlike Watchmen, feels the need to forgo it's source material and carelessly neuter and re-draw the context of who the character of Wolverine is with an icily dislike for what he stands for and instead opts to destroy one of the most authentically complex, revolutionary and terrifying superhero backstories since Batman into one of the most inferior kinds of watered-down, mundane and PG-rated money-making garbage ever to grace the silver screen.  At the very least, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a film that recognizes how pointless it really is as Wolverine's backstory has already been shown to us in the first two X-men films so none of the events that take place in X-Men Origins: Wolverine have any tangible sense of relevance on the character growth of Wolverine or the other characters for that matter. The viewer understands that by watching the film, everything Wolverine will attain will eventually be removed from his memory and forgotten about with the movie serving only as a mere action-packed memory which, even if something had presented itself and was worth speaking, it would have been fruitless to say anything regardless no matter how much one might want to. Those filmgoers or comic book fans looking for the moralistic and complex character arch that Bryan Singer gave Wolverine in the first two X-Men movies and Days of Future Past as well as what James Mangold did on The Wolverine and Logan or what Bret Ratner tried but failed to do on X-Men 3 will be severely let down by what X-Men Origins: Wolverine does to him. Though the movie takes place in the 70s and 80s as well as being a prequel to the first three X-Men films, it sadly doesn't give us the glimpse into that world in its foundational years. One would think that this new group of people evolving at this time in history and with the Civil Rights Moment going on at that, you would think that Hood, as well as Benioff and Woods and even Rothman, would want to explore that aspect of who the X-men and Wolverine represent. In lieu of that, however, the movie doesn't seem to any interest in exploring such lofty ideals. As a matter of fact, it appears that there have always been mutants in the previous X-men films, at best centered around the plethora of supporting metahumans, so it really doesn't make a lick of sense why the US and Canadian governments are all of a sudden alarm in the 20 years in the future. If anything, the metahuman population is declining rather than increasing. But to make such conclusions would be detracting as it is scathing to pick apart loads of little inconsistencies and moronic ideas that the writers and Tom Rothman injected into the finished movie or the incredibly lazy storytelling where the screenplay attempts to try and link X-Men Origins: Wolverine to the previous three X-Men movies much, in the same manner, the Star Wars prequels or the last previous James Bond film do in order to work rather than standing on its own. There's absolutely zero inspiration here in the screenwriting, no joy of life and no fun. Nothing here feels natural or emotional like in some of the other Marvel movies like Spiderman 2 or Avengers: Infinity War. The story simply isn't broad enough to ensure that it'll be taken purposefully, but it's also too nervous to be an all-out fun superhero movie due to the crashing tones set by Rothman's micromanaging. There's also nothing here to add to the character of Wolverine as what is interesting about him has already been explored in the last three movies as well as in Days of Future Past and the two later Wolverine films so this retelling of his backstory feels incredibly unnecessary and run-of-the-mill. It would be forgivable if the movie had tried to add something new to Logan's backstory to make it interesting but it sadly doesn't and all we're left with is a piss-poor origins story lacking any real character's for the viewer to care about or a compelling hero we can symphonize with. Of course, the film's problems don't stop there as even the CGI looks lazy and half-assed notably with Logan's claws which one would think that they would have been matured over the last three movies. They look like someone just colored them in, and feel like a vast departure from the visual effects that had been used back in 2002 for the first Spiderman film or the effects used in Dr. Strange. In a movie that almost recommends the viewer to suspend the notion of reality for even a simple story to function, it requires great effects to assure the viewer that a helicopter could be parked amongst some trees or that Wolverine is actually diving into some water. The effects here look so bad that they make the effects in Justice League look like Richard Donner's Superman. Also, given how the movie is only an hour and 59 minutes long, it does seem to not focus on Wolverine's origins for too long as after about 10 minutes of seeing James Howlett as a child, we are then thrown into a montage of him and Victor fighting in several wars. This just highlights again how paper-thin the plot and characters are. So far, we've had very little investment in the character of Wolverine and even less investment in Victor Creed. All we know about the two when we are first introduced to them is that Logan is traumatized due to him killing his father who we never saw him share many scenes with Logan let alone give us any reason to care for him getting skewered by his son and that Victor hates humans even though we never see him attack or try to kill any, we're just told that he hates them making his motives unclean throughout the entire film. Also poorly developed is Wolverine's relationship with his girlfriend and somehow becomes even less authentic by the end. In one scene that is supposed to develop Wolverine and Kayla's romantic relationship, all we get is some bizarre Native American myth about the moon which comes across as dull and randomly comical. Oh, and if this wasn't nonsensical enough, Kayla is, in fact, a mutant so she's mesmerizing Logan in order watch him for Striker, and she the forges her death so that Wolverine will then go aft",7,0,1,16 October 2018
Deadpool 2," Twice the Deadpool, twice the fun.
","Given how the post-credit scene at the end of the first Deadpool film teased a sequel, I honestly got quite gritty as given how much I adored the first Deadpool film, I couldn't wait to see it so once the trailers for Deadpool 2 dropped, I grew even more ecstatic to see the film but I ended up seeing Avengers: Infinity War instead. I didn't watch Deadpool 2 until a few months later and much like the first film, I absolutely loved it. From its strong direction and non-stop humor to its marvelous action scenes and top-notch acting, Deadpool 2 is another home run for comic book films as a whole.The film opens with Deadpool as known as Wade Wilson blowing himself up following a traumatic event. The film then fasts forwards two years where Wade fails to kill one of his targets and celebrates his anniversary with Vanessa where the two decide to start a family of their own. That night, the target that Wade failed to kill tracks him down and in the following shootout and kills Vanessa only to have Wade kill him in retaliation. Blaming himself for Vanessa's death, Wade blows himself up a few weeks later. Upon seeing a vision of her in the afterlife, Deadpool's various body parts are reassembled by Colossus and as a form of mending his broken heart, Deadpool agrees to join the X-men. Soon after, he, Colossus, and Negasonic Teenage Warhead respond to a faceoff between authorities and a mutant named Russell aka Firefist. After an incident where Deadpool kills one of the staff members, both he and Firefist are locked up in a prison for mutants. Meanwhile, a time-traveling cyborg more solid named Cable arrives from the future to kill Russell before he murders Cables' family. He then breaks into the jail and attacks Russell while Wade attempts to defend the boy but gets his ass handed to him. Wade then falls off a cliff and lands in a freezing lake, just before he dies, Wade has another vision of Vanessa which tells him to help Russell. Now, Deadpool must put his own team together to stop Cable from killing the boy.More to the point, the movie doesn't go for the humor over an adequate story rhythm unlike a movie like the 2016 Ghostbusters remake. Deadpool 2 never tries to alter its story just so it can throw in a few more jokes into the film just for the sake of it. The jokes are there to serve the plot, not to dominate it. Sure, the gags are hysterical, but they aren't practically callous or critical. There's never a feeling that the film is or always will be a deconstruction of superhero movies in that it really doesn't have anything interesting or thought-provoking to say about the genre unlike The Dark Knight or Captain America: Civil War apart from admitting that most moviegoers are genre-blind when it comes to comic book movies but Deadpool 2 doesn't need that to be a great movie. Not all superhero movies need to be deep and pretentious as the genre really doesn't lead itself to that area of filmmaking with a few exceptions but Deadpool 2's real purpose seems to just be a fun movie without the need to talk down to its audience. Understandably, this is never a problem in Deadpool 2. As a matter of fact, what's most astonishing about the movie, especially in this age of reboots, sequels, and remakes, is the respective ability with which the movie tells a basic story. For all the gags about genitals and pop culture, there's always quite a few scenes of genuine emotion that do work much like in Avengers: Infinity War as do the characters in both films. Easily the strongest point of the MCU are the characters and how they grow and develop over the course of the films, Deadpool 2 is the same way. The characters here are nicely fleshed out, their arcs and ambitions are clear to the viewer. Despite all the humor, there's a layer of attractive and compelling depth that's not hard to find if you look closely enough.Much like the first Deadpool movie, Deadpool 2 has been seen as a deconstruction of superhero movies as well as a comedic masterpiece and while that's a fair assessment to make of the movie, it's really a little bit of both to me. The movie feels most functional because it works so well as a basic and genuine comic book film with a whole lot more gore added in and just a pinch more self-alertness sprinkled in to give the film that extra kick. Of course, to say that Deadpool 2 isn't funny would be like saying Riders of the Lost Ark isn't an action classic or that Citizen Kane isn't one of the greatest films ever put to screen as the movie is an absolute laugh riot. Every joke that comes at the viewer is a gut-buster every time. Right when the opening scene starts up where they take jabs at director David Leitch as the guy who killed John Wick's dog in a jovial fashion, it's obvious that Deadpool 2 holds no pop culture subject sacred. During one action scene, Wade attacks Deadpool creator Rob Liefeld by saying he's a guy who can't draw feet, referencing Liefeld's erratic drawing style. Hugh Jackman gets a ton of jokes aimed at him throughout the course of the movie from Deadpool flipping the bird to the film Logan and how it's just cashing in on his R rating. Some of the other jokes aimed at Jackman include a wind-up toy with Wolverine impaled on a tree stake and a reference to Hugh's role in Les Miserables. Much like the first film, there are also some great visual jokes directed at the X-men such as when Wade claims to have never seen any of the team only to have a room full of them right behind him. It's a fantastic visual joke but also tires Deadpool's world back to that of the X-men nicely. Lastly, there are a ton of jokes directed at both the MCU and DCEU from the jabs at Batman V. Superman to Deadpool calling one of his teammates' Black Widow and calling Cable Thanos which were some of the best jokes in the film for me. Often, the set-ups for the jokes are even jokes themselves which makes the movie all the more fun. To add to that, the screenplay by Reese, Wernick and Reynolds is intelligent and funny as the dialog seems to carry all the action upon its shoulders and is laugh-out-loud comical as Deadpool's chain of thought speaking technique helpfully explains the films' events to the viewer not to mention the continuous fourth wall breaking that Deadpool is famous for makes the film have a very self-referential feeling to it, making it even funnier.Furthermore, there's no disagreeing that the strangeness of a comic book film turning a d-list X-Men villain called Black Tom Cassidy into a frequent gag with certain attention being given to the characters enduring comic book history. Deadpool 2 is certainly and clearly made by people who have actually read comic books or at the very least, understand them as opposed to making the film a total mockery of its source material like Fant4sic was. When Deadpool meets The Juggernaut, he specifically calls out the names of several comic books into his fanboy blubbering. Along with that, the movie never forgets that it is, in fact, an X-men sequel, not just inconsistency but also in its approach to the core themes of the X-men comics and how the film wears its progressiveness up its shirt shelves. There's a simple storytelling approach that Deadpool 2 uses in its acceptance of the eccentric hidden agenda from the offhand references to a strap-on to the remarkable moment of Deadpool accepting Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend, Yukio. Unlike other major Hollywood films, Deadpool 2 never makes its agenda the main focus of the film but uses it subtlety to assist the story at hand.There has been an argument that Deadpool 2 is the best X-men film to date and while I still think X-men: Days of Future Past, X-men: First Class, Logan, and the first two X-men films are far superior in terms of characters and themes, that's not to say that this film isn't great in its own right. This is most apparent in the way that the story discovers itself undoing around the Essex Home of Mutant Rehabilitation which is yet a further inside joke poking fun at the change of heart rehabilitation which also makes the joke even funnier. Upon seeing the film, it's also clear that both director David Leitch, as well as the production crew, have read the Deadpool comic books given the number of story nods from various X-men and Deadpool storylines which do make the film a bit more tongue and cheek than most other comic book films. Even the tiniest details allude to four-color developments. When Deadpool brings together his cutting-edge counter team to the X-men, the filmmakers are cautious to include clever references to the diverse incarnations of the superhero team known as X-Force which is refreshing as well as hilarious to see onscreen.Also, Deadpool 2 also works surprisingly well as an action film with a somewhat direct story and dependable characters with clear motivations. Given director David Leitch's background in codirecting the first two John Wick movies, it's hardly surprising that this guy knows how to shoot action scenes with his trademark bright and organized style that works wonders for the movie. As with the films in the MCU, the action setpieces in Deadpool 2 are loads of fun to watch and impressive given how bloated some action setpieces in certain superhero movies have gotten. The opening montage of Deadpool slicing, hacking and killing gangers and thugs all over the world is breathtaking to behold while the battle between Cable and Wade in the prison is nicely shot and nicely put together but the best action setpiece the movie gives us is the trunk chase where Domino and Deadpool are busy trying to drive a prison truck and battling Cable at the same time which makes for one of the best chase sequences in any action or comic book movie and what's even more wonderful is that although the viewer knows that the scene they are watching is all CGI but it does feel realistic in every possible way.The story and character arches in the film don't offer much in terms of surpr",10,2,4,8 January 2019
X-Men," A new dawn for comic book movies.
","When it comes to the X-men, I watched the 90s animated show, but I never read the comics as a kid, so when I sat down to watch the movie, I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, well I can say that X-men is a fantastic movie from it's themes about discrimination and bigotry to it's acting and it's faithfulness to the source material, in fact had it not been for this movie, the comic book movie renaissance may never have happened.The movie starts with a young Erik Lehnsherr is taken from his parents, inadvertently reveling his mutant abilities, later the Senate attempts to pass a registration act for mutants which deeply concerns Lehnsherr's former friend Charles Xavier, meanwhile Marie D'ancanto flees her home and arrives in Canada where she meets another mutant named Logan, the two are soon brought to Xavier's school and now must stick together to stop Magneto's evil plans.Unlike many of Marvel's and DC's heroes, X-men is a more socially and morally complex comic series about individualism and injustice as the heroes are not accepted and have to fight for a place in the world and unfortunately suffer because they're not only different but also possibly deadly. The bigotry that humans display towards these mutants provides an interesting metaphor for our own recent climate of political, ethnic, sexual and homophobic intolerance as well as the anxiety teens and young adults face as they seek their own place in the world. Some have equaled the battle between Magneto and Professor X to the clash between Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X while others have commented on mutants as badges for any persecuted group of people compelled to classify themselves whether they be minorities, LGBT, or gun owners. Even the narration at the beginning of the movie aptly captures the X-men's background as well as the deep-seating battles they will have to face.While many comic book movies open with sweeping credits and fabulous music, Bryan Singer decides to set this movie up a little different by showing us the horrors of the Holocaust which recalls several scenes from Schindler's List while Lehnsherr unleashing his power evokes the prom scene from Brian De Palma's Carrie and as far as movie intros go, the opening scene at Auschwitz grasps the viewer with its sadness and clearly, this appalling and gloomy scene isn't the traditional way to open a comic book movie not to mention the way the scene also shapes the villain's perception of mankind and allows the viewer to feel sympathetic for Magneto and realize that he isn't like Darth Vader or Norman Bates but rather a ill-guided radical who has seen the dark side of humankind and sees them as inferior making for a much more interesting comic book villain than what some comic book films try to do with their villains.As for the director, Bryan Singer, he deserves all the praise given to him over the years because apart from a few other directors, he has been able to make a truly great comic book film by giving each character, be them hero or villain, enough development to in order for us to care about them as well as addressing the themes that the comics touched on without preaching or hitting the audience over the head with it and a lot of that comes from the acute and insightful dialog from the screenplay by David Hayter and an unacknowledged Christopher McQuarrie whose fingerprints can be viewed throughout the movie like the argument between Senator Kelly and Jean Gray at the beginning of the movie is enlightened but it also sets up the events of the movie to come while the conversation between Erik and Charles towards the end of the movie interprets what a discussion between MLK Jr. and Malcolm X would should be like. The film is nearly perfect with it's editing and music as we move from scene to scene with every moment benefiting the scene and never overstaying it's welcome while the music by composer Michael Kerman is truly magical but also dark and foreboding at time, perfectly complementing the dark tone of the film. Unlike a lot of more recent superhero movies, there isn't a lot of action in the movie as it isn't the focal point but it's still impressive to watch and is more than fulfilling and incredibly elegant like the fight between Wolverine and Sabertooth in the snow or the final battle at the Stature of Liberty while the visual effects are also fantastic and seem to add to the film rather than distract from the viewing experience.As for the cast, they're all flawless, Ian Mckellen is outstanding as Magneto and what might have come across as a corny performance instead gives us a distinguished and authentically enraged villain as Ian appears to create layers of cruelty and discrimination within himself, making for a more sympathetic villain rather than a power-hungry madman and he could have easily made the movie his own. Famke Jessen is admirable as Jean Gray and brings a lot of deepness to what otherwise could have a poorly written character while James Marsden brings the overly firm Cyclops to life in a wonderful way, Rebecca Romjin brings a lethal edge to the shape-shifter Mystique while Halle Berry brings a certain believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Patrick Stewart was born to play Charles Xavier and gives a wonderful performance, conveying all the characteristics of a father figure and leader. Anna Paquin is perfect as Rouge, bringing a level of anxiety to her performance but also still managing to be a strong interesting character, but Hugh Jackman as Wolverine makes the movie and plays the character with every dose of hotheaded and depressing enthusiasm and it's a joy to see.There's really nothing more that can be said about X-men, it changed comic book movies and should be watched.",10,1,1,31 October 2017
Spider-Man 3," Unbalanced, cluttered and unfocused.
","Following the financial and critical success of Spiderman 2, director Sam Raimi sought to use the third movie to bring an end to Harry's Green Goblin arc that the first two films had set up as well as using Sandman and Vulture as the main villains for the movie but producer Avi Arad had other ideas. He began pressuring Sam to include Venom in the movie in order to set up for his own spin-off but Raimi was reluctant to do it due to him not being a fan of the character but Avi kept insisting until Raimi caved. In addition to that, Gwen Stacy was also shoehorned into the movie at the request of the studio and Harry's story arc was expanded to make him a supervillain. What started out as a more personal story that dealt with issues of forgiveness had quickly turned into a bloated and overcrowded story where Spider-Man was battling 5 separate villains as well as dealing with a mostly one-sided love triangle which resulted in a story that was compromised by having too many hands in the pot.Now, I never saw Spiderman 3 in theaters when it came out in 07' as I didn't watch many comic book movies at that time and given the backlash it received upon its release from the fans, I decided to stay well away from it, but early last year, I finally decided to watch it in preparation for Spiderman Homecoming and upon finishing the movie, I didn't think that it was as horrible as some of the fans were making it out to be as there are certain things I enjoyed like the action scenes and most of the acting, but the story, writing, characters, and tone left a lot to be desired in my eyes.The film starts off three years after the previous film where Peter Parker is finally about to propose to his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson. After attending her debut in a Broadway show, Peter and Mary-Jane go to a park and while stargazing, a meteor falls close by and a strange black liquid craws out and attaches it to Peter's moped. Meanwhile, convicted criminal Flint Marko escapes from jail and hides in his family's house only to be pursued by police into a testing site. On his way back to his apartment, Peter is attacked by a masked figure who reveals himself to be Harry but before he can kill Peter, Osborne is injured and develops amnesia as a result, causing him forgot that Peter is Spiderman. After learning that Marko was actually Uncle Ben's killer, the black symbiote bonds with Peter changing his outfit as well as his attitude and behavior. Now, with this new entity processing him, Peter begins to alienate his girlfriend as well as having to battle several new enemies and dealing with his own worst enemy: himself.Now given my love and admiration for Sam Raimi and what he did on the first 2 Spiderman movies, it's truly mind-boggling how many incompetent and moronic decisions he and the crew made when making the film or how there are so many little inconsistencies that could have been fixed before the movie was finished. Now, I'm well aware that not everything in the final film will be perfect nor am I looking for problems in the narrative but I do expect things to make sense and not leave the viewer confused or scratching their heads: why is Mary Jane being given 3rd billing in a Broadway show and why does she have the opening song? The symbiote leaps onto the back of the moped as Peter and Mary Jane leave and neither one of them bother to even look on the back of the damn bike? When Parker arrives at the apartment after dropping MJ off, where has the symbiote gone, did it turn invisible? After Parker leaves his aunt's apartment and is attacked by the New Goblin, where does the moped go? Does it hit something and burst into flames and where in the hell does the symbiote go, shouldn't it still be attached to the back of the bike? As Harry pursues Peter through a narrow alley, Peter shoots a piece of webbing between two buildings, how come when Harry does see the webbing why doesn't he just duck under it or cut it? How could anybody still be alive after taking the kind of fall that Harry just had and why is Peter still hanging around after Harry has been injured? Why isn't he running away in the other direction? When Marko climbs a fence to escape the police and ends up in a testing facility, there is clearly a sign that says keep out, why did he not stop to even read what the sign said? Why do the scientists inside the testing facility not even bother checking to see if that change in the silicon mass is really a bird? Why does Peter have a change of clothes when he arrives at the hospital, how did he get home to change and where's the moped? Why is Peter's apartment door still not fixed? When Mary Jane leaves Peter's apartment, the symbiote is seen climbing down a lampstand. How did it come to be there? Did it arrive with Mary Jane? Why does Spiderman leave after saving Gwen, he still has a crane to stop. How did Sandman learn how to fly? Why did Peter feel the need to kiss Gwen right in front of Mary Jane? The number of inconsistencies and incompetent decisions in this movie are nothing short of idiotic and it just ends up doing more damage to the movie.Not only does the movie suffer because of massive inconsistencies and plot holes, but unlike the first 2 movies where a straightforward tone of being fun at times but still maintaining a sense of seriousness worked so well, Spiderman 3 has a serious tone issue as it can't decide what it wants to be. Throughout the course of the movie, there'll be moments of fun then a serious scene will pop up causing the movie to grind to a halt resulting in an extremely jarring experience that just leaves the viewer confused and disappointed by the movie's end. Given the fact that Sam and his brother Ivan had a hand in writing the screenplay, it's no shock that these two shouldn't be writing any script as the dialog is cheesy in a lot of areas and down-right cringe-inducing at times, making the movie come across more like a soap opera rather than a comic book movie which shows just how in over their heads the Rami brothers were when helping Alan Sargent write the screenplay. Much like X-Men 3 and The Amazing Spiderman 2, Spiderman 3 also feels the need to throw so much into its 2 hour running time in order to try and please the fans which results in both the story at hand and the characters suffering due to the overstuffed narrative and the fact that there isn't enough time for each character to really shire unlike a movie like The Avengers nor does it allow any character growth resulting in the viewer having no investment in any of them as well as the movie having too many subplots that go nowhere. Sandman aka Flint Marko is a convicted felon whose motivations revolve around having a sick child and that's what compels him to steal which is supposed to make the viewer feel sympatric about his plight but it mostly just comes across as weak and melodramatic and fails to make us care about Marko or his daughter. Just because you give a character in a movie a child or a family doesn't make them sympathetic unless you take the time to make us fee for them, this kind of emotional heartstring pulling didn't work for The Patriot and it sure as hell doesn't work for Spiderman 3. Also infuriating is the recon of Sandman being Uncle Ben's killer. Now I do understand why Sam Raimi did this as he wanted to have the film's story be about Peter learning to forgive Sandman for murdering his uncle which is fair enough, but the way it's handled when Marko explains to Peter that he accidentally killed Uncle Ben comes across as forced and unearned as well as incredibly sappy rather than heartfelt and while the Martha scene from Batman V Superman is far more stupid, the scene in Spiderman 3 just feels like the ending of a cheesy soup opera rather than a genuine emotional finale. Much like Sandman getting a piss-poor character, Mary Jane Watson also gets a character assassination by going from a determined and career-driven woman in the first two movies to being a self-righteous and sobbing attention hog here. Since when was she ever interested in becoming a singer? In the first two movies, it was clear that MJ wanted to be an actress, but what was the reason for making her a singer? It makes no sense in the slightest. Not to mention the writers completely miss the point of who Mary Jane is as a character as she's a fun-loving, cheeky, high-spirited young woman who helps Peter to burst out of his nerdy shell and have fun while in the movie, the writing makes her come across as a whiny pre-madonna who bursts into tears just because of one bad review and doesn't even tell Peter that she was let go from the play for not being able to sing worth a damn and when Peter tries to give her some words of encouragement, she rebukes him and continues to whine about her career ending throughout the rest of the movie, hardly a character worth caring about. Thanks for that, Sam, Ivan and Alan. As for Harry Osborne, his arc is just as stupid and nonsensical as the other characters arcs in the movie. Besides becoming the next Green Goblin, Harry still wants revenge on Peter for supposedly killing his father in the first movie which could have been averted if Peter could have just explained what actually happened to Norman briefly back in the last movie rather than wait until now but what's even more stupid is how during the first battle between the two of them, Harry suffers a concussion resulting in him getting amnesia and yet doesn't remember the events prior to his accident, another example of how lazy the writing is here. After that, Harry is pretty much useless until he regains his memory in the most paretic way imaginable. Even more nonsensical is towards the end of the movie when Harry's butler tells him what really happened to his father causing Harry to go and help Peter even though Peter tried to kill him earlier in the movie and apparently Harry is perfectly forgiving of Parker and shows no sign of anger towards him.",7,1,2,25 June 2018
The Terminator," A movie that all modern sci-fi and horror films aspire to be like.
","Describing the 1984 classic, The Terminator is difficult for me because when I was young, I never saw it before due to being too young to watch it and so for a long time, it slipped under my viewing radar until late last year when I finally decided to give it a watch and after the end credits rolls, I was left in awe and wonderment at what I had just seen. From it's themes and dark and gritty feel to the directing and performances, The Terminator is truly a groundbreaker in terms of filmmaking.The film begins in the distant future where a nuclear holocaust has wiped out much of the human race and those who have survived are engaged in a brutal war with machines known as Terminators. In order to stop the human resistance from ever winning the war, a Terminator is sent back to 1984 to kill a young woman named Sarah Conner so her son will never lead the human race to victory. Unbeknownst to them, the resistance sends a lone solider named Kyle Reese back in time to the same year to protect Sara. Upon arriving, both Reese and the Terminator obtain clothing and weapons, meanwhile The Terminator deliberately begins murdering all women named Sara Conner. After looking her up in a telephone book, both men track Sara to a nightclub and once there, the Terminator almost kills her but Reese saves her and the two make a quick getaway while the Terminator pursues them. Now, Conner and Reese must do what they can to avoid this robotic killer while trying to reset the future. Upon viewing a couple movies by directors like Steven Spielberg or Stanley Kubrick, you begin to understand the way they approach certain elements of the film they're showing you, not just making the movie but also character interactions or small intricate details that help tell the story effectively. James Cameron is a fine example to use when describing this circumstance as he is a deeply talented director with a boundless disadvantage on what his filmmaking insight could be but with one high breakthrough with the Terminator and a whole other world opened for him. It's of little consequence if the director or writer doesn't makes sense of it, though some do such as Vincent Van Gogh who wrote about the creativeness he had passionately. Whichever way you choose to see it, when the movie viewing audience grasps a movie like The Terminator, the filmmaking world seems to alter as a film such as this shows both audiences and critics what can be done when a director puts his mind, heart and soul into a film and makes something truly special out of it. Cameron is an absolute force when it comes to filmmaking and a infamous perfectionist when it comes to telling stories, but all that paid off handsomely as the film maintains its rewatchability without coming across as pretentious while Cameron is a master of the small details like the police officer at his disk working on his form-filling with a small pencil and stops in the middle of a sentence to look up and see a car crashing though the front doors. Since James co-wrote the script, that makes the story even more intimate rather than just a solid achievement in directing as he apparently got his idea from a dream where he was being pursued by a mechanical skeleton with a bright red eye but I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron also drew inspiration from several episodes of the Outer Limits when coming up with ideas for the movie while the entire movie seems to always have an immediate, brutal atmospheric feel and a placid sensibleness which is distinctive of a bad dream which only seems to highten the tension and dread as the Terminator hunts down Sarah and Kyle and it seems there are only a few small moments in the film that allow the viewer to catch their breath not to mention never is there a scene that just feels like it's trying to pad out the running time nor does it dumb it's subject matter down to the lowest common denominator which also makes the film more approachable for the viewer.As for the filmmaking side of things, The Terminator certainly excels there too. The cinematography is to a very high standard with a dark, dirty and grungy look that makes the world Cameron has created feel much more lived in and believable while Stan Winston's stop-motion effects and Terminator endoskeleton is legendary in terms of their fluidity, movement and outright terror, but it's composer Brad Fiedel who deserves the most love: his pounding, techno-infused score is truly one of the finest film soundtracks of all time and perhaps even the best device Cameron has used in maintaining the movie's driving force. The score is astonishing, conflicting and grim all at the same time with a ceaseless bass line that keeps the movie appearing like it's not going to stop, not until the villain has be dealt with. One peculiar scene in the movie is a perfect representation of all these elements coming together under Cameron's masterful directing is the moment where both the Terminator and Kyle enter the Tech Noir club looking for Sarah. As the robot wanders though the place and advances towards the table where she is seated, the movie alternates into an unreal slow-mo as Conner drops a bottle on the floor and crouches to pick it long enough for the Terminator to forget her as he walks by. The 80s music now is faint due to the expansion of time as Brad's musical score comes into play, Sarah stands up and sees not the robot but Reese looking at her unaware that her pursuer is now circling back around and is nearly about to notice her but just when the slow-motion comes to its high point, Reese sees what Conner hasn't as the Terminator pulls a gun on her and is about to pull the trigger when Reese does the same and the viewer is suddenly thrown back into the here and now and all hell breaks loose. The amount of tension used in this one scene stays its course throughout the entirety of the movie which makes it one of cinema's most effective thrillers. Of course, the action in the Terminator shouldn't be overlooked as it's some of the finest out of any 80s action movie. The shoot out in the night club is a true masterstroke in terms of dread and tension as the Terminator and Reese duke it out and the robot takes the action up a level as he fires his gun as Kyle does the same. Once he's thrown though the glass, he gets up from the sidewalk and starts chasing Conner and Reese while the shoot-out at the police station is a perfect exercise in brutality as the robotic killing machine marches through the halls massacring everyone in sight while the scene of Sarah killing the Terminator is a benchmark of suspense and intensity. As for the cast, they're all fantastic: Linda Hamilton was born to play Sarah Conner, portraying her as a more grounded, naÃ¯ve and defenseless character here rather than the battle-hardened badass we see in T2, yet it doesn't seem too mind-boggling she becomes that as the movie progresses and we see her grow as a character and begin to see the warrior side of her emerge practically at the end when she crushes the Terminator plus the chemistry between her and Biehn is prefect and any scene of them together is always a treat to watch. Michael Biehn is absolutely fantastic as Kyle Reese, portraying him as a scrawny, thin and realistic hero, so much so that the minute he's introduced, it's difficult not to see his helplessness when you see the scars across his body when he comes out of the portal and when he battles the Terminator, he is outclassed which allows the viewer to see his weaknesses as a character as does his willingness to give up his own life for his cause shows just how hopeless his situation is, something Jai Courtney failed to do in Genisys. Lance Henriksen is wonderful in his role as the police sergeant as is Earl Boen and even Bill Paxton pops up in a small role, but it's Arnold Schwarzenegger as the titular villain who makes the movie so wonderful to watch. Even with his limited dialog, Arnie still is able to kick to tension up to 11 whenever he is on screen To declare that the Terminator had a foreboding presence on screen would be putting it mildly, he's absolutely terrifying as a villain due to his simple motivation of killing Sarah and nothing else which is what makes him such an effective villain and not your standard greedy bad guy with no motives we contently see now a days.Honestly, is there anything else that needs to be said about the Terminator that others haven't said already? It's a must see movie even if you're not a fan of sci-fi or horror. Go watch it now.",10,2,4,26 March 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A breath of fresh air for Marvel's prodigal son.
","Following the massive underperformance of the Amazing Spiderman 2 in 2014, Sony Pictures was in a difficult position as while the Spiderman films were still making good money at the box-office, something needed to be done to shake things up on the filmmaking side of things as the company had no intent to sell the Spiderman rights to Marvel due to their own financial problems but with fan support for Peter Parker to join the MCU growing louder, it became obvious that Sony would need help with the future of Spiderman on film. As it turned out, Marvel Studios was already willing to lead Sony a helping hand long before any of their shared universe plans could be put into motion. Due to their grip on the Spiderman merchandise, Disney was far more willing to promote the Spiderman films that Sony was making then they were with the X-Men and Fantastic 4 films 20th Century Fox were making at the time. Nevertheless, Marvel still had an interest in binging the webhead into their cinematic universe in order to provide a strong foundation for the MCU after the end of Phase 3. Despite being reluctant to work with Marvel, Sony head honchos Tom Rothman and Amy Pascal decided that a deal where Spiderman would appear in an MCU film in return for an MCU character making a camo in one of their Spiderman spin-off films would be perfect as this would allow Marvel Studios to produce a trio of Spiderman films for Sony all while allowing them to maintain creative control, marketing, and distribution as well as breathing new life back into the brand. However, a massive rift of corporate safety was about to force Sony to make a deal between them and Marvel.In December 2014, the Seth Rogan and James Franco buddy comedy The Interview was released and given that the film's plot dealt with the assassination of North Korean leader, Kim Jong-Un, it was deemed insulting by the North Korean government which led to a group of hackers called The Guardians of Peace taking action against Sony by stealing a large number of files from the company and even went so far as to threaten terrorist action if the film was released. While a wealth of information on Sony and its upcoming slate of films were leaked to the public, the most important impact of this was that the future of Spiderman on film was about to change. Once the information of Sony's discussions with Marvel about Spidy joining the greater MCU went pubic, fan support for Peter Parker appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe grew louder as more pressure was put on Sony to make a deal with Marvel Studios. In January of 2015, the higher-ups at Sony were interested in holding a meeting with the heads of Marvel Studios in order to have a clearer idea of where they wanted to go with their Spiderman films. Sony chairperson Amy Pascal suggested that Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige be invited to the meeting but once the Sony hack occurred, Kevin's presence at the meeting became a necessity in order to give the meeting a little more direction and to put more of a focus on bringing Spiderman into the MCU. In February of 2015, both Marvel and Sony announced that they would be sharing custody of Spiderman and while Sony Pictures would still retain the Spiderman film rights but they would be allowed to the MCU characters into the films they co-produced with Marvel Studios and maintain a certain degree of creative control while Marvel would be allowed to use Spiderman and his supporting cast in the MCU for 5 films starting with the character being rebooted within the confines of the cinematic universe but Sony would also be allowed to make solo films that wouldn't necessarily tie into the MCU thus allowing them to make their own stand-alone shared universe.Now, as someone who isn't a massive Spiderman fan, I was quite excited when I heard the news that a new Spiderman film would be apart of the MCU and upon seeing the trailer for Spiderman: Homecoming, I was pumped to see it so In July of 2017, I went to see it with a friend of mine and after watching the film, I can say that despite a few small issues, Spiderman Homecoming is a fantastic return to form for the character of Spiderman and while it does lack the strong cinematic punches the first two Sam Raimi films have, I still genuinely love this movie.The film begins following the aftermath of The Avengers where salvage worker Adrian Toombs and his team are cleaning up the left-overs from the Battle of New York but when the Department of Damage Control arrives and force Toombs and his gang out of business, Adrian decided to sell the Chitauri tech they've salvaged and use it in selling advanced weapons. We when fast forward 8 years later to Peter Parker after the events of Captain America: Civil War. After aiding Tony Stark in Germany, Peter continues his high-school education while also focusing on fighting crime in his neighborhood as Spiderman. However, while foiling a bank heist one night, Peter has a run-in with criminals using weapons Toombs sold them, and another night, Parker has a run-in with Adrian's gang as they sell weapons to local criminal Aaron Davis. n the ensuing fight, Peter is almost killed but is saved by Tony who warns him not to interfere with the gang. Now, Peter must prove his worth as an Avenger while also juggling his high-school and family life as Toombs threats everything Peter loves.In essence, Spiderman: Homecoming is basically two films that are efficiently set up by the title alone. In the plainest sense, it's basically a teen coming-of-age story that just happens to be set against the background of a Marvel superhero film. More than some other entries in the recent superhero film boom, Homecoming is very clearly a young adult film but not in the vein of Twilight or the Mortal Instruments. It's Spiderman if directed by John Hughes with all the clichÃ©s and customs of the genre as seen through the arch of a teen film. As such, the homecoming aspect refers to not only Peter Parker's place as a high school student but also signifies the character's return to the greater Marvel film universe. In a more symbolic sense, Spiderman: Homecoming is the story of bringing Peter Parker into the larger MCU that began with Iron Man back in 2008 but it also honors the deal forged between Sony and Marvel. Both sides of the film work to each other's advantage as the first half serve as a John Hughes Spiderman film while the other half serves as a nice tie-in to the Avengers and Captian America: Civil War. To add to that, The first Avengers film is very much a fixation for Spiderman: Homecoming as it's showing us that the first scene of the film doesn't focus on Peter Parker or Spiderman but rather the aftermath of the Battle of New York. The second shot the viewer sees is of Avengers Tower in it's ruined state along with a drawing that symbolizes Peter's longing to join the Avengers as well as reflecting Peter's dream of joining the likes of Iron Man and Thor and it is this fantasy that will challenge Peter later on in the film.Now, in all honesty, Spiderman's journey to the MCU is a long and difficult one. In the mid-1990s when Marvel Comics had filed for bankruptcy, they had no choice but to sell off the film rights to many of their most beloved characters to film studios. Sony got Spiderman and Ghost Rider while The X-men, Fantastic 4, and Daredevil were all stanched up by 20th Century Fox. In a lot of ways, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was built on the backs of a bunch of B and C list superheroes, characters that no film studio wanted, and that not a lot of people were familiar with. Basically, the success of Blade in 1998, Bryan Singer's X-men in 2000 and Sam Raimi's Spiderman in 2002 predate the MCU by a decade and showed that comic book films could be so much more than just campy action but once Iron Man was released in 2008, Marvel Studios soon become a force to reckoned with in the Hollywood landscape and after being bought by Disney in 2009, they went from being an underdog to being one of the biggest studios in Hollywood. This high-octane shift changed the superhero game so much that Marvel started grabbing the film and TV rights to unwanted characters like the Punisher and Daredevil and after the purchase of Fox's entertainment division in 2017, the X-Men and Fantastic Four. By the time Sony rebooted Spiderman in 2012, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was such a powerhouse in the world of cinema that where was even talk of having the Oscorp Tower show up in the first Avengers film but, it didn't pan out and Spiderman remained disconnected from the greater MCU for the time being.So following the underperformance of the second Amazing Spiderman film and the firing of Andrew Garfield, Sony was left with ether recasting the role of Peter Parker, rebooting the series again or working with Marvel Studios, and while many Sony executives wanted to keep Spiderman out of the MCU, coming for a shared custody agreement with Kevin Feige and the rest of the Marvel creative team was the best possible course of action both companies could have made as even if Sony had continued on with the own Spiderman shared universe, I feel that Sony would have over-saturated the market with Spiderman films and spin-offs which would have led to moviegoer fatigue and continuing diminishing returns on investments so I personally feel the deal between Marvel and Sony works both ways even if the temporary split between the two companies last year resulted in Spiderman almost being yanked out of the MCU but thankfully cooler heads prevailed and for the time being, Spiderman is back home at Marvel.Now, unlike what some Spiderman fans might claim, there's absolutely nothing wrong with having Spiderman join the larger MCU as it allows the filmmakers to create their own story that still fits within the confines of the world that has already been built for the Avengers and their associates. After all, ever since Spiderman's debut i",10,0,0,29 June 2020
Alien," Space never looked so scary.
","My experience with Ridley Scott's 1979 classic, Alien is limited as I never watched it as a kid mostly because I was far too young to even see it and given how slow paced it is, I would have probably been bored by it if I did watch it, but as I got older and began to hear other people comment on how excellent the film was, I felt compelled to give Alien a watch and lo and behold, I absolutely loved it. From it's glorious visual style and effects to its marvelous soundtrack and performances, Alien is everything that most modern horror movies wished they could be.The film opens with a massive mining spaceship called the Nostromo returning to Earth with its crew in status sleep. When the ship's computer known as 'Mother' detects a distress call from a nearby planet, it awakens the crew and they are ordered to investigate. They land on the planet and Captain Dallas along with Lambert and Kane head out to find where the distress call is coming from. They soon discover that the call is coming from a gigantic alien spaceship and enter into its depths. Meanwhile, back on board the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley attempts to translate the distress signal only to discover that it may be in fact a warning but can't send the information to the other crew member. Inside the ship, the other crewmembers discover the remains of a massive alien lifeform. Kane then descends into a chamber full of egg-like pods and when he touches one, a spider-like creature leaps out of the egg and attaches itself to Kane's face. Dallas and Lambert bring the unconscious crewmember back to the shuttle and order Ripley to let them aboard but she refuses, stating that everyone else would be at risk but science officer Ash violates her order and lets them in. He and Dallas then attempt to remove the facehugger from Kane's body but with every attempt, it's grip tightens on his face but eventually, the facehugger lets go and dies. Upon returning to the Nostromo, Kane awakens from his ordeal but doesn't remember anything apart from a dream involving smothering. Before they return to status for the remainder of their journey, the crew have their last meal together. All of a sudden, Kane begins to choke and convulses in pain before a petit alien busts out of his chest and runs off into the ships cooling ducts. Now, the crew must find a way to capture the alien and jettison it out into space.It's impossible to think that Alien was only Ridley Scott's second future film after 1977's The Duelists. The movie has the certainty of being made by a director who has decades of experience working within the genre and working with the most skillful filmmaking veterans, thus giving the film a rigorously gleaming grow to it, with an astonishing manner and craft. The movie has the look of an epic blockbuster but there's also no indication that the budget was ever compromised and there's very little to indicate that Fox tried to micromanage the production of Alien. It's difficult to imagine that Ridley's film ran into any of the same production problems Alien 3 was subject to because this movie holds everything in check so perfectly.It's almost absurd to play down the importance of Alien both as a film and a gift to both sci-fi and horror. It popularized Ridley Scott and his visual style. It showed people that sci-fi movies could still be embedded in ideas and analogies rather than go the route Star Wars had gone two years prior as well as frightening the living crap out of movie audiences, something that it still does 39 years later and something a horror movie like The Nun hasn't been able to do. Much like Scott's other seminal sci-fi masterpiece, Blade Runner which is both innovative and sentimental which drew upon and renewed the understandings of film noir, Alien is on one point a meeting of two different genres of horror movies. On one foot, the movie is a haunted house film, centered around a foundation that dates back to the 1920s with a building that is haunted by an entity or a creature, which in turn bears ill will for those who enter while on the other foot, the movie draws from the slasher genre popularized by Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in which a group of people is killed off one by one by an evil force of nature who then does battle with the final survivor.What Alien manages to do in one full swing is to deal with the central issue of both these film genres by a blend of ambiance and character development. The faults of many haunted house movies boil down to a basic idea: if being in the house is so horrifying, then why out leave? In Alien, there is simply no getting out. The Nostromo is a boundless maze of passages and cooling ducts with a creature that could be lurking anywhere, ready to pouch. The film is agonizingly suffocating, so much so that there is a point when the viewer finds themselves rapidly looking around each corner of the screen as the tension and fear begin to build. Additionally, the main issue of most slasher movies is that more times than not, the characters are so poorly written and paper-thin that the viewer has no investment in them. The principle reason people paid to see all the Halloween sequels was because of all the detailed and cheesy ways the characters were killed. Over its 40 year history, Halloween went from Michael Meyers being this unkillable incarnation of evil to being in a reality TV show and reduced to battling Busta Rhythms. Alien, however, takes its time to develop its characters in the movie's opening act. The first hour of the film is surreal and takes its time, from the unhurried Kubrickian camera shots of the Nostromo's hallways to the time jump of John Hurt waking from hypersleep to the mocking conversation about the food the crew is eating and the additional situation. Even after the facehugger attaches itself to Kane's face, the movie to its goals and keeps the character growth coming regardless of the situation. It adds to Brett and Paker's outcast position along with their loss of respect for Ripley, all of which become ever more important as the story continues to play out.Alien has often been described as the anti-2001: A Space Odyssey, the lower-class description of space set against the glistering white grandeur of Kubrick's ideas. This isn't surprising in the slightest as screenwriter Dan O'Bannon who also wrote John Carpenter's sci-fi film, Dark Star brings over a lot of elements from that movie and adds it to Alien. Rather than be a polished clean spaceship, The Nostromo instead is a grubby and dilapidated ship inhabited by hard-working men and women who don't care for many things apart from getting paid and getting home. Aspects of corporate suspicion and gender discrimination are key to the films' overall look and feel such as when Ash disobeys Ripley's orders to confine the other crew members and acts incredibly arrogant towards her when she remains him who's in charge while Lambert is the complete opposite of Ripley as she comes across as the typical screaming women archetype seen in many horror movies but she is still never the less an interesting character. All of this makes Alien feel like an early example of having a strong women character who isn't an overpowered and over-feminized much like more recent Hollywood blockbusters. As a matter of fact, it's really because of her grasping her femaleness that Ripley is able to defeat the alien. She decides to go back and save the cat even though the ship is about to explode and then undresses in the escape shuttle and basically becomes a sensualized object for a brief moment. Of course, this is the scene in the entire Alien franchise where Ripley feels the most womanlike but only after grasping a sense of femininity that she seems to have hidden for the majority of the movie. The company depicted in Alien with Ash as their ambassador, are snooty, selfish and indifferent to the lives of everyday people or even women. Those same people are the ones who end up saving the universe even if they have to risk their own lives in order to do it. Let's also take into consideration the character of Ash as because he is a robot, he is a flawless clone of a human, thus sowing the seeds for what Blade Runner would later do. Although he may not do certain things normal people do, Ash can still interact with the other members of the crew of the ship which in turn makes him all the more unaccepted than Ripley even is. There are no feelings of erotic slanting in his actions as the movie progresses much like the rest of the crew to a point that Ash seems almost loveless. However, once he starts glitching do his actions take on a more sensual approach. His body gestures during his conflict with Ripley no longer feels ordinary which given how Ash doesn't even act like a normal person but rather looks like he has blown a fuse. His bizarre actions start with his entrance into the Nostromo's navigation room. His mannerisms towards Ripley look disturbingly like a sexual violation, right down to his effort to suffocate her with a magazine so if this scene isn't some kind of Freudian declaration then I have no idea what is. All of a sudden, the character of Ash who has spent the majority of the film extroverted and informal becomes a passionate hunter in the same vein as the alien itself.The final test for all horror movies is whether or not the movie is even scary, and while Halloween still remains the most terrifying horror movie I've ever watched, Alien is still pretty damn close in terms of suspense and dread. A high part of this lies in the practical creation of the movie. Much like John Carpenter, Ridley Scott understands that authentic horror exists in the viewer's mind and that people aren't frightened by what they see but rather by what they think they see. By displaying so little of the alien until the very end of the film, Scott implants a seed of dread and terror into the viewer's mind, which continues to grow as the deaths be",10,0,1,19 November 2018
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Does everything that a sequel should do.
","After watching Captain America: The First Avenger, I wasn't sure where Marvel would take the character after that, well, sure enough, I sat down to watch Captain America: The Winter Solider and it didn't let me down one bit. Everything in this movie from the action to the characters to the story is so much better than the first one and rarely does that happen in a sequel.After the event of the Avengers, Steve Rogers has been living in Washington D.C., working for S.H.I.E.L.D. While on a counter-terrorism strike mission, Rogers sees Natasha Romanoff obtaining information from the ship's computers for director Nick Fury. Steve meets with Fury and is told about S.H.I.E.L.D's new project: three Helicarriers that are networked to satellites and are designed to destroy any threat to S.H.I.E.L.D. Turns out all is not what it seems at S.H.I.E.L.D and it's up to Captain America and Black Widow to fix things. Along the way, Rogers must face an old friend turned foe from the past.While Joe Johnson did a fantastic job directing the first Captain America, Anthony and Joe Russo do a much better job on this movie and while the movie might not be the complex movie ever made, it expends on the characters and gives them more depth especially with Steve Rogers where in the first one and in the Avengers, he is a John Wayne-type American telling people how things are done, while here he's in a ethical gray area and how he deals with it is the heart of the story. Working this development into a honorably complex movie means that Rogers never inquires what he believes nor does he challenge his basis, but he does challenge where he is and what his role must be. While the movie might out be the most innovative movie ever made, it certainly ups the ante with a darker tone which hearkens back to many 70s political thrillers and it's a very welcoming change that makes this movie stand apart from other superhero movies. There are several powerful scenes concerning paranoia, government control and information handling, echoing how our world has changed following 9/11 and yet it never feels overstuffed or intimidating.The action is incredible and is a step up from some of the other MCU films, from Cap's shield being used in all its splendor to the cinematography which is diverse and quick without having to resort to quick cuts and shaky cam while the phenomenal elevator fight are just some of the exceptional action set pieces and the action scenes with the Winter Solider always feel exciting and chilling at the same time. Throughout the movie, the action keeps changing from stealth operations, to car pursuits, to gun battles to hand to hand fights. Having the characters use their gifts as well as guns is a smart move as opposed to having them use their bran in every scene. Easily some of the best action I've ever seen in a comic book movie. The visual effects are also impressive, the musical score by Henry Jackson is effective and serves it's purpose and the script by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely is tightly written and has a little humor mixed in.Once again, the cast in Captain America: The Winter Solider is stellar in every way. Chris Evans once again nails it as Captain America, playing him with the utmost sincerity while also maintaining his nationalistic ideals even when he is left questioning where he stands in world, while still being a bad-ass when it comes the fights. Scarlett Johansson further develops the charm and character of Black Widow and shows us that she is capable of kicking major ass in the movie, while bringing a superb and active balance to the upfront and narrow mindset of Rogers even showing a bit of love for him but they still rely on each other. Samuel Jackson returns as Nick Fury and carries the role wonderfully while showing a more accessible and human side to himself. Frank Grillo brings Brock Rumlow to life in a believable way. Cobie Smulders is wonderful as always as Maria Hill. Emily Vancamp completely rocks as Agent 13. Robert Redford is a powerhouse as Alexander Peirce, portraying the prefect kind of villain that has plenty of satire and apathy that make him more than a match for our heroes while never venturing too far from the film's political themes but also doesn't come across as over-the-top makes for an incredibly memorable villain. Anthony Mackie is a welcome addition as Sam Wilson/Falcon, playing him much like a war vet and it's great to see him be used as a supporting character or unwanted comic relief. Sebastian Stan is truly terrifying as The Winter Solider/Bucky Barnes and he does an amazing job maintaining his own against his victims and those who stand in his way and his presence in any scene will send chills running down your spine. The relationship between him and Steve is handled brilliantly, showing how much Rogers still cares for Bucky and yet, he must stop him in order to save the world recalling the relationship between Anakin Skywaker and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Revenge of The Sith.I really don't have anything negative to say about this movie. It's engaging, fast-paced, has tons of action and great acting and has a nice mid-credits scene that sets up the next MCU movie. While Spider-Man 2 and X-men: Days of Future Past are now my favorite Marvel movies, Captain America: The Winter Solider is still one of my favorite Marvel comic book movies. Go watch Captain America: The Winter Solider if you haven't already. It's an awesome movie and should be viewed by anyone who is a comic book movie fan.",10,4,9,20 May 2015
Doctor Strange," The MCU goes psychedelic.
","Much like my exposure to Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr. Strange was always a character in Marvel's lineup that I never was familiar with as I never read any of his comic stories so when Marvel Studios announced a movie about the Sorcerer Supreme, I was mildly interested just because of how big of a fan I am of the MCU and the fact that Benedict Cumberbatch was going to be playing the lead so I went into the film with medium expectations and I came out stunned and amazed by what I watched. From it's mind-blowing visual effects and dazzling action set-pieces to its brilliant humor and acting, Dr. Strange is easily the trippiest and most interesting MCU movie I've ever watched.The movie opens in a secret complex where an evil sorcerer named Kaecilius and his followers sneak into the complex's library and steal a couple pages from a mystic book only to be chased out by the head sorcerer known as the Ancient One. We then cut to Dr. Steven Strange, a rich, admired and vain neurosurgeon who is injured in a car wreck which therefore costs him the usage of his hands, leaving him incapable of performing any kind of surgery. After nearly bleeding himself dry financially while trying to find a cure for his damaged hands, Steven hears about a mystic place in Nepal know as Kamar-Taj from a man who was able to regain the use of his legs. Desperate, Strange travels to Kamar-Taj only to be rejected at first but is taken in by Baron Mordo. The Ancient One displays her powers to Steven, showing him various other dimensions as well as the astral plane. Upon seeing this power, Strange begs to taught in the ways of mysticism but The Ancient One is hesitant to train him due to his ego and aspiration but eventually agrees to mentor him. Meanwhile, Kaecilius uses the stolen text pages to contract Dormammu from the Dark Dimension in order to aid him in his mission. Now, Strange along with Baron Mordo and The Ancient One must do battle with Kaecilius and Dormammu and pervert Earth from falling into chaos.Over the course of ten years, the MCU has gone from strength to strength in the matter of storytelling prowess, providing the directors and writers an opportunity to push against the typical and formulaic approach to movie-making in Hollywood by nurturing a resounding and exceptional creative and storytelling insights coupled with the guiding hand of a studio president whose vision for a shared universe is carefully planned out over the course of several decades which has lead to some of the greatest comic book movies of our time like The Avengers, Black Panther and Guardians of the Galaxy, movies that have been indisputably influenced not only by the filmmaking sentiments of their directors but also from what Kevin Feigie has done for the MCU and while some of these movie may not stack up to the comic book movies made by Richard Donner or Christopher Nolan, almost all of the MCU movies stand out from some of the other comic book movies of recent memory for their readiness to tell a familiar story from a different angle while some movies made in the Marvel camp like The Amazing Spiderman 2, X-Men 3, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, Spiderman 3 and Fant4sic fail due to their faithfulness to the studio's band of style and micromanagement no matter how hard the directors and writers try to make their vision stand out. Pretty much everything great about Thor: The Dark World was snuffed out and felt like it was being written and revised by a set of rules that were created to increase what made the first movie so great and implant them into a recognizable format. However, most of the MCU films have accomplished this through their grasp on Marvel Studio's distinct designs and awareness by working strongly within the confines and limits of what Fergie has sent up with the MCU but also accept the expectations dictated to them and thus play close to them. By doing so, the films adopt a certain balance and flexibility so much so that such a proven strategy when it comes to filmmaking has paid off time and again for these movies and allows the filmmakers to work their magic in creating a film that not only provides us with an escape from reality but also can give us a great story with characters we can be invested in along with giving us a movie that is fun to watch without feeling the need to be too artsy or snobbish and Dr. Strange is one such movie.Much like what the first Thor movie did with its emphasis on science and magic, Dr. Strange smartly decides to go a similar way with its story. There are never too many unexpected twists and turns that find their way into the story or the arrangement of the movie. The film unfurls precisely as the viewer would expect it to but this isn't always a bad thing. All the parts are there ready to be assembled and are ready to be added with the authenticity of a watch that Strange carries around with him as a relic and all the character archetypes are presented to the viewer even before we have a chance to get to know them and yet the movie never feels the need to bring down or curve these characters but rather it concentrates on improving them to a fine point and feeling the need to realize those points with the aid of a talented cast, glorious visual effects and a slight smirk on the movie's face. More so than that, the relevant directness of the movie's plot allows director Scott Derrickson to attach some rather mind-blowing action set-pieces and as well as some nifty visual composition and while some have whined that all the MCU look the same when it comes to their visual look and color palettes, I personally have never seen anything wrong as it always seems that every movie Marvel Studios makes always has a distinctive look that differentiates from the previous movies and Dr. Strange certainly has a unique look that makes it stand out from previous comic book films and feels like a breath of fresh air.Unlike some more recent comic book films that feel the need to take themselves much more seriously then they should, Dr. Strange actually seems like it's eager to embrace it's outlandish source material rather than run away from it and nowhere does that become more apparent then a scene where Strange does battle with some of Kaecilius's minions with some help from The Cloak of Levitation. A cape is an iconic piece of superhero iconography as both Superman and Thor have shown us and Dr. Strange turns the Cloak of Levitation into a character itself. Every time the cloak in onscreen, director Scott Derrickson can't get enough of it and rightfully so as the cloak is honestly fantastic even if it's just a prop much like the Magic Carpet in Aladdin. Some of the film's most enduring shots are centered around the cloak practically the final shot in the trailer where Strange is climbing the steps to the Sanctum Santorum is truly breath-taking. Despite how the cloak may feel like an inanimate object, it still has a personality all it's own. The instant that Stephan dons the cloak, he starts to become a more useful superhero. The movie makes the point obvious to the viewer that a lot of this is happening directly tied to the cloak itself. To add to that, the humor in Dr. Strange is some of the best in the MCU as every single joke in the movie is timed just right and never feels forced or unwanted but makes the viewer bust out laughing when the humor does come. The scene of Strange confining Kaecilius is particularly gut-busting as Strange grads a bizarre medieval-looking device that results in Kaecilius being caught in a compliant position as the gadget locks itself into place. The scene is a true testament to great humor as well as the power of great writing and comic timing.Like Thor before it, Dr. Strange can be revised as an insightfully quintessential superhero movie built from ideas floating through the artistic subconsciousness. The film feels very recognizable and not just because of its story arraignment but also because it feels very much like a Marvel movie from top to bottom. Steven Strange is pretty much characterized in the same way as Tony Stark was as he starts off as a vain and full-of-himself billionaire but though a life-threating accident and its aftermath, he vows to change and as a result becomes a better person and uses his newfound powers to protect the world and while this trend may seem clichéd and worn out to some, I felt that it fit the tone of the film perfectly and didn't dwell on the origin for too long as opposed to Frant4sic. Apart from drawing a lot of influence from Thor and Iron Man, the film adds in elements of the TV show House to its portrayal, a British actor speaking with an American accent playing a self-centered doctor who is aloof when it comes to people as well as a few touches of Dr. Who thrown in due to the movie's frequent captivation with time as well as a few tiny callbacks to Inception due to the exploitation of space and time. While the movie may not do any better than the movies it's referencing, it still is able to throw all these elements into a blender and mix them in a way that feels appealing and breathtaking in and of itself.As for the visual effects in Dr. Strange, they are just as spectacular as one might expect. With CGI improving all the time, certain shots and action set-pieces that would have been nigh to impractical a decade ago are now the standards for big-budget Hollywood movies and there's something that can be said about being able to see all these memorable comic book ideas being brought to life onscreen in an aspect that clearly delights in and holds fast to the more bizarre images and ideas of the world of Dr. Strange. When Stephan takes a journey through the multiverse, every area he passes through is realized to such a high degree of perfection that it's almost sensory overload just watch the entire scene but nonetheless, it's all so glorious that you simply can't take your eyes off of it and soak it all in for what it has to offer.

Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A 2-hour snooze fest.
","Following my viewing of The Phantom Menace in 1999, I eagerly waited for the next installment of George Lucas's epic sci-fi series, Star Wars to be unleashed upon the world and in November of 2001, I got my first taste of what that would be when I saw a teaser trailer for the newest Star Wars film called Attack of The Clones and my excitement level went through the roof. With every new trailer that dropped over the next few months, my eagerness to see the movie grew to the point that it was all I talked about so in May of 2002, me, my parents and my brother went to go see Attack of The Clones and after the end credits rolled, I was gobsmacked by what I had just watched. Much like The Phantom Menace before it, I simply adored Attack of The Clones and I remember watching it many more times. However, as I grew older I began to hear that the film was even worse than The Phantom Menace and I was taken aback as I loved the movie for what it was and had seen nothing wrong with it apart from it's long-winded run time but upon rewatching Attack of The Clones in preparation for seeing Episode 9 later this year, I found it to be a tedious and boring film when it came to the story, running time, dialog and the characters while I was entertained by the action, musical score and some of the acting.The film opens with Senator Padme Amidala arriving on Coruscant to vote on a motion that will create an army to aid the Jedi in a war against the Separatists but upon her arrival, she narrowly escapes an assassination attempt on her life. She is then placed under the protection of Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi and his 19-year-old apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. Later that night, the two Jedi stop another assassination attempt on Padme's life. After chasing the assassin through the traffic and lower levels of Coruscant and arrest her, but before they can get any further information about her, she is killed by a figure in Mandalorian armor. The Jedi Council then instructs Ob-Wan to track down the bounty hunter while Anakin is to escort Padme back to Naboo and protect her. Kenobi first visits an old friend for information on the dart that was pulled out of the assassin. After trying to find the location of the planet called Kamino in the Jedi Archives fails, Ob-Wan then finds the planet himself. While there, he discovers that an army of clones that have been created for the Republic. Meanwhile, on Naboo, Anakin and Padme begin to develop strong feelings for each other even though with her being a senator and him being a Jedi, having a romantic relationship is forbidden. Now, Padme and Anakin must keep their love for each other hidden while the galaxy descends further into conflict.Now some people may think it's acceptable to say that Attack of The Clones failed to reach its goal of improving on what The Phantom Menace was unable to do and that was to give the audience a great Star Wars film that wasn't going to bore them and that's pretty much what the movie did. Now given how George made such a mediocre and boring film with The Phantom Menace, one would think that he would have listened to the criticisms of the previous movie and made sure that Attack of The Clones wouldn't follow in the same footsteps. Boy was that not the case as for right when the movie opens, the viewer is bombarded with exposition about the Separatists, Count Dooku and how overwhelmed the Jedi are. Ok, how in the actual hell is an army going to help the Jedi deal with this problem, don't armies usually provide the opposite of what the Jedi do? From what I can tell, the Separatists aren't killing people or destroying things, they just want to leave the Republic because they see it as unfixable so why when is there a vote that will determine wether or not an army will fix the problem or having them aid the Jedi? And to add to that, are the Jedi saying that you either stay in the Republic or you die? What the hell kind of Jedi are these?! What are they protecting the Republic from? If Chancellor Palpatine didn't what the Republic to fall apart then maybe he should have set it up a lot better. What's even more moronic is the question Palpatine asks after that, will there be a war? A war over what?! Once again the Separatists aren't killing people or destroying things, they just want to leave the Republic.Also, why in the hell does Padme still have a decoy?! She's not the queen of Naboo anymore so why is this needed and who in their right mind would want to even kill her?! So right when the film starts, we are never told why or who would do this. Even when Anakin escorts Padme back to Naboo, the two of them do nothing but go for walks, have a picnic on the grass and have dull conversations so I dare ask what is the point of Anakin protecting her if all they're going to do is talk about things that have no impact on the story at hand or did the whole assassination subplot just vanish?! Good God, George, how much more inept can you be here?! This is not rocket science, it's basic plotting and storytelling! It just shows me how moronic Lucas is here when it comes to the writing on Attack of The Clones. Rather than have a boring romance between the two leads, it would have worked a lot better if Anakin was actually protecting Padme and have both of them narrowly escape several assassination attempts and from that do they begin to fall in love with each other rather than just jettisoning both of them into this dull love story.Another issue I have with Attack of The Clones is how poorly the romance between Anakin and Padme is handled. Now, I have no problem with a romantic subplot being in any film as long as the romance helps advance the story in some way such as in Titanic or Deadpool but how the love story in this movie is absolutely horrendous and there's really nothing to it here. George has taken what may have been an interesting romance between these two and made it boring as hell. Now, I'm well aware of those who have defended the relationship between Anakin and Padme and while that's understandable, I don't agree with these people as I feel that the romance in the movie lacks any sense of actual love or passion between our two heroes. Throughout the film, it's painfully obvious that both of them are completely wrong for each other while also trying to make a case for why they should be together, not to mention, none of this has to do with love. As for our two lovebirds, they're both dull as dishwater. Anakin has had 10 years to fantasize about Padme and to build up this image of her into something that isn't even tangible and he's infatuated with her as an embodiment of feminine excellence. With him wanting and caving women in his life, Anakin permits Padme to be that role in his mind which is understandable as she did show him love and concern after he left his mother so Anakin is used to seeing her as an elegant, matured and compassionate character. But the issue here is that his obsession for her doesn't go past that fantasy. He loves her simply because of the way she makes him feel, hell, he actually mentions to Obi-Wan earlier in the film that just being around her is stimulating but the actual Padme, what she embodies, her feelings on the galaxy, her hobbies, and interests, her feelings, ultimately don't mean anything to Anakin. He fumes at her effort to take charge of their situation while on Naboo by declaring that he is in charge of security which comes across as a bizarre and inept moment for Anakin and highlights how little he actually knows Padme. She is a former queen so she would know where the best places to hide are so through Anakin's petty whining, he reduces her to being a woman in jeopardy stereotype, chucking upon himself the role of protector rather than allowing her to accept him as that. This whole scene feels a bit snobbish and even a little sexist as Anakin assumes that he should be in charge rather than allow Padme to do what she needs to do.Likewise, he largely doesn't care about anything Padme says about politics or social ideology. When Anakin blunts out his real feelings on the government and how it should function and Padme calls him out on it sounding like a dictatorship and he responds by saying that it works then fakes his way out of the situation with a laugh as if he was only teasing her. Yeah, not the kind of guy one would like to have a relationship with. Of course, I know that he isn't so why this tiny bit of negligence? Well, he isn't enquiring his obsession with Padme by either overlooking or bypassing anything that might intimidate his romantic version of her. So rather than trying to discuss with Padme openly and talk to her candidly in order to see if the two of them are even remotely well-suited for each other rather than change subjects when things get embarrassing. In Anakin's mind, Padme is someone to win over, to make him feel in control, to bury his own mind restrictions as a Jedi. She is the lotion for his bruised ego and a mother figure to claim his uneasiness and self-loathing, not a person that he actually loves. Sure, all of this is clear enough but the larger question that remains is why does someone as refined and intelligent as Padme Amidala fall in love with this whiny egomaniac? The simple answer is she doesn't really love him either. Given what we already know about her, Padme is a character who grew up being a queen and who strived to make the galaxy a better place and is a career-orientated person who values her job over her personal life but when Anakin comes into her life, he compels her to think about herself and sure, he does it in the most uncouth way possible with his eerie goggling and all his droning on about dreaming about her along with all his teenage melodrama garbage about the kiss that he forced out of her becoming a scar if she doesn't give him what he wants.However, in the long run, he's telling her something she isn't used to hearing and compelling her to see herself as a sub",7,0,0,26 February 2019
Ant-Man," Feels more like a heist film rather than a superhero film.
","Having never read a single Ant Man comic as a kid, I went into my local theater speculating how Marvel would be able to make people care about a lesser-known Marvel character with mediocre abilities. Sure enough, Marvel keeps proving me wrong because Ant-Man really surprised me with its great writing and humor, fantastic action scenes, great performances and a really touching story about redemption. After watching it, After watching it, I don't think I've had as much fun watching a Marvel movie in the theater as much as Ant-Man.The movie begins in 1989 where inventor Hank Pym quits S.H.I.E.L.D. upon discovering that they have tried to reproduce his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Considering the technology to be too risky, Hank vows to keep it hidden for as long as he lives. We than cut to the present where Pym's daughter, Hope and his past apprentice, Darren Cross, have pushed Hank out of the company and Cross is close to finalizing a shrinking suit of his own. Meanwhile, well-meaning burglar Scott Lang is released from jail and moves in with an old cell-mate. While visiting his daughter unexpectedly, Scott is scolded by his ex-wife and her police husband-to-be for not paying child support. Soon after, Lang comments a robbery with a few friends where he breaks into a house, only to find what appears to be an old motorcycle suit, but when he tries it on, he discovers its true powers. It turns out that Hank Pym ticked Lang into stealing the suit and now, wants him to become the new Ant-Man in order to stop Cross from launching the Yellowjacket suit.I truly don't believe that there has ever been a superhero film where the lead character starts out as somebody who could usually be the villain and comes out as a hero in the end. This must've been a difficult achievement for the writers and the director to pull off and yet, they did just that and made Scott Lang so likable that you're cheering for him throughout the whole movie. In a nutshell, the idea of overcoming or submitting to your past is the thematic thread of the film as Scott desires to earn back his daughter's love by becoming a better man, while Hank Pym is attempting to rewire his relationship with Hope and come to terms with his wife's passing, and Hope and Darren are attempting to grapple with their own difficult feelings toward Pym's behavior towards them. Eventually, with each of the characters defined, it doesn't take the viewer long who conquers their past and who doesn't, but the fact that a comic book film contains such themes as redemption and making amends for your past mistakes as well as the risks of hate and envy adds a lot to the final film.The screenplay written by Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish, Adam McKay and Paul Rudd mixes all the elements of a Marvel film by throwing in action, comedy, and even some emotion and it's all written capably which serves the film well. The movie is overflowing with humor and even during the serious moments, there is at least some comedy to prevent things form getting too stale. These days, few movies are bold enough to be a little silly and have a fun time, but Ant-Man really excels at that and one can tell that the filmmakers knew the idea was ridiculous and they didn't care. The characters take the circumstances they're in seriously and have faith in their causes, but are also cracking jokes at every turn which does make a film a lot more light hearted than say Batman V Superman.The special effects are top-notch, particularly the scenes of Ant-Man shrinking and his interaction with the ants. The action scenes are stunning and very well done with the fight between Ant-Man and Falcon and the end battle between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket taking place in his daughter's room on a play area with a toy Thomas the Tank Engine track with our hero and villain having a massive fight in miniature that manages to be humorous, but also has the viewer feeling fearful and struggling to breathe. This movie is a different turn for Marvel in terms of the action and story and while it isn't epic or action-packed as The Avengers, it has a nice mixture of humor, story, touching moments, dangerous circumstances, stunning technical developments and a concluding fight.Much like Chris Pratt in Guardians of the Galaxy, Paul Rudd is incredibly likable as Scott Lang and fits into the role perfectly, dropping the archetypal Rudd jokes that we know and love, but is also capable of showing real emotion during the scenes with his daughter. Evangeline Lilly continues to show how tough she is in this film as her version of Hope Van Dyne is intense and definitely has attitude to boot. If another actor was to playing the role of Hank Pym, it could've been boring and moralistic, but Michal Douglas makes the character important and fascinating. His sense of humor is on point and has outstanding chemistry with the other actors. Corey Stool is pretty solid as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket and brings some depth to this evil scientist. Michael Pena, David Dastmalchian and T.I. all play a humorous group of crooks who provide extra humor to the movie, particularly towards the end of the film. Bobby Cannavale and Judy Greer play their roles well and Abby Fortson is cute as Lang's daughter. Even Anthony Mackie and Hayley Atwell show up as Falcon and Peggy Carter and give fine performances.I really enjoyed this movie a lot, it's funny, the actors all do a great job, it has great action and some very touching emotional scenes to boot. Make sure to stay after for two mid-credit scenes. Go see Ant-Man if you haven't already, it's one hell of a ride.",10,0,2,7 November 2015
Captain America: The First Avenger," The original American hero.
","Growing up, I was never into Captain America, nor did I ever read the comics, so when I sat down to watch this film, I had no clue how it was going to turn out. Was it going to be a great action film or a schlocky mess? Well, I will say that while Captain America didn't blow my mind like Iron Man, Thor or Guardians of the Galaxy did, I still found it to be a very entertaining and engaging movie, from it's 1940's theme to it's great acting and fantastic action scenes.The film starts off in the frozen Arctic where a Russian oil team discovers something strange buried in the ice. They call up the Americans who slice through the ice and find a large aircraft under the snow and uncover a round read, white, and blue shield with a star upon it. The scene then cuts to a Norwegian village in March of 1942 where Johann Schmidt aka Red Skull seizes a mysterious item known as the Tesseract which boasts limitless power. Meanwhile, over in America, the U.S. army deems draftee Steve Rogers unfit for military service due to innumerable health problems, but Rogers doesn't give up and soon gets picked as a test subject for a 'super solider' experiment and is injected with a unique serum. Following the experiment, Rogers emerges feeling taller and more robust but an undercover Hydra agent kills the doctor preforming the experiment and runs, but Steve chases and catches up with the agent but he takes a suicide pill before Rogers can get any information out of him. Now, Rogers dons the outfit of Captian America to order to take down Hydra's operations.Joe Johnston may not seem like the right man to direct a film like this, but given what he did on The Rocketeer, I can't think of a better director for the job. What he does is rather than make Captain America a dark, heavy superhero film like what Nolan did with Batman, he goes for a more fun call back to films like Riders of the Lost Ark, something the MCU has become so well known for and Captain America: The First Avenger sure doesn't hold back on it. The writing is truly fabulous with a mix of both humor and heart, the romance between Steve and Peggy feels natural, the pace of the movie is great and never once did it feel padded out or boring in any way nor did any of the humor. As with the other Marvel movies that I've seen so far, the casting is perfect. Chris Evans plays an excellent Captain America, bringing a lot of sincerity and heart to this character and he does it perfectly. During the first half of the film, Johnson slowly builds momentum to allow us time to get to know Rogers as a courageous little guy who suffers from the fury of bullies. This pitiful weakling through never lets anyone knock him down, and it's enjoyable to watch because Evans makes it look so genuine even with the computer effects. It's also very exhilarating to see a hero was isn't spending the whole movie moping around and play a true hero and rather than having Chris play Cap as a parody, the writers and the director take the character seriously and it pays off beautifully. Steve comes across as an incredibly interesting character, proving that the belief that an old-molded hero is lower to his anti-hero counterparts just isn't true. Hugo Weaving always plays a great villain and here, he is fantastic as the dark and menacing Red Skull. Tommy Lee Jones puts out a very convincing performance as Captain America's supervisor and even has a few humorous lines in the film. Haley Atwell is attractive, aggressive and just pain beautiful as Peggy Carter and the chemistry between her and Evens just trickles off the screen and makes for one of the MCU's best romances. Toby Jones is wonderful as a pitying, almost agreeable Arnim Zola. Stanly Tucci plays Dr. Erskine perfectly well and Dominic Cooper does a solid job playing Howard Stark as does Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes. Even Samuel Jackson makes a small cameo at the end of the movie teasing what is to come for the MCU.The visuals are fantastic and while they may not look realistic or look a bit too much like Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, they are still impressive with some great usages of immense lenses help to make the movie look far more realistic then something like Transformers that use a massive amount of CGI.The action in this film is fantastic with a lot of slow-motion shots being used to great effect during the battle scenes with some stand-out action scenes for me being the car chase, Rogers rescuing the prisoners, and the final showdown between Cap and Red Skull. The visual effects look pretty good and really work well when it comes to the action scenes and when it comes to the musical score, Alan Silvesteri kills it once again by giving us one of best superhero scores in recent years and it hits all the right points that it has to. All and all, I would say Captain America: The First Avenger is definitely a great action thrill ride with a lot of heart thrown in and should be watched by any comic book film fan. Go give it a watch if you haven't already, you'll enjoy it.",10,2,3,24 March 2015
The Thing," Terrifying in every possible way.
","When it comes to horror movies, I'm all about mood, atmosphere, a creepy soundtrack or an anonymous killer lurking in the background ready to strike which is why I was intrigued to watch John Carpenter's The Thing and I loved it thanks to it's usage of atmosphere and music, it's creature effects and it's likable characters. Upon watching this, I wish more horror movies like this were still being made rather then the CGI-heavy, jump-scare garbage we keep getting.The movie starts with a spacecraft crash-landing in Antarctica then cuts to 1982 where a Norwegian helicopter chases a dog to an American research base only to have one of the crew members drop a explosive device which destroys the chopper while the lone surviving member be shot by the base commander who then sends two other men over to the Norwegian base for answers only to find a burnt husk of buildings with human remains. Upon returning to their own base, their naturalist does an analysis on the body, discovering a normal set of human body parts. Meanwhile, another crew member cages one of the dogs when it suddenly morphs and starts attacking the other dogs. The men manage to flame broil the creature, but now they begin to grow suspicious of each other as the thing begins killing them one by one.With so many abysmal remakes of classic horror movies being released, John Carpenter's The Thing is a perfect example of a remake done right as it takes all the best features of the 1952 Howard Hawks' movie and from the original book and puts it's own spin on things and yet maintains the frozen landscapes of Antarctica as its backdrop which works perfectly for installing a profound sense of loneliness as well getting into the heads of the characters and deepening the feelings of anxiety and dread that encircle them. Throughout the entirely of the film, the viewer is always on high alert as the treason and danger never seem to let up even in the quiet scenes which makes it even more creepy and unsettling. Given how simple the story is, I feel that a lot of modern Hollywood writers could learn a thing or two from the Thing and through the plot is especially frightening, specifically when the viewer contemplates what might happen if the alien is able to find its way into our culture and other small details that make the movie so great. When one of the characters demolishes every mean that the group can use for communication or escape, leaving them entirely cut off from the outside world adds a lot more uneasiness and dread to the film and while the others don't resort to anything quite as drastic, the sense of distrust they have towards each other helps make scenes could have been mind-numbingly boring into moments of nail-biting and terrifying horror.In comparison to the original movie, the conflict comes from the basis that killing the alien becomes unimportant to finding out what it really is and in one of the twists of fate, the moment where the main hero is able to detect the alien doesn't mean the paranoia and fear are gone and the scene where Macready conducts a blood test to analyze who is really this creature is unrivaled in any other horror movie when it comes to nail-biting suspense. As for the creature itself, it comes across as a mystery as the viewer is never told or shown it's motives or even if it has any nor does it have a main form as it is able to clone itself which makes the tension even more unbearable and scary to watch.The Thing shows John Carpenter at the height of his directing prowess by creating a true feeling of uneasiness on such an agonizing level and so far, only Alien and Halloween have been able to generate the kind of tension that The Thing has been able to deliver. Right from the moment the alien appears, Carpenter turns the anxiety meter up to 11 and never lets up on the tension and fear and when the results are delivered, it is handed to you with a painful kick. John's directing and camera-work is nothing short of perfection here with rapid camera work and forceful shots which is aided by Dean Cundey's superb cinematography not to mention Ennio Morricone's haunting musical score. While some may argue that the movie's characters are flat and uninteresting and while I would say that this area of the movie isn't Carpenter's area of expertise, it still works to the film's benefit as we are given barely any details on the characters, it only makes the circumstances a lot more baffling as you are never sure who is really who they say they are.When a film tends to depend on visual effects, the movie usually suffers, however The Thing doesn't thanks to the talents of Rob Bottlin and while some see makeup effects as a branch of visual effects, there's no denying that Bottlin knocked it out of the park here by giving us some of the most impressive transmogrification effects in a horror movie with its vague designs, half-created human appearances glaringly balanced with wide sets of teeth, spider legs and durable tentacles. The creature effects here are absolutely fantastic and gut-churning, but aren't too gory or over-the-top unlike some other horror movies.As for the actors in The Thing, they all do a fine job and play their roles well but it's Kurt Russell and Keith David are the two actors who matter most. Kurt's low-key character of Macready is boundlessly watchable and more critically, realistic and Russell plays the boozy, courageous yet hesitant leader with zero difficulty while Keith David is wonderful as Childs. The final scene of the two sharing a bottle of whiskey is one of the most enduring endings in any movie.Definitely a movie worth seeking out.",10,1,3,26 November 2017
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," A sequel that surpasses the original in every possible way.
","Now, when it comes to me and Terminator 2: Judgment Day, I never saw it as a kid due to my age and it's subject matter never practically interesting me, but as I grew older, the movie certainly peaked my interest so last year, I decided it was time for me to watch it and once the end credits rolled, I was in utter shock at what I had watched and I absolutely loved it, from it's action and character moments to it's themes and acting, T2 is truly a gem of a sequel.The film starts with a bleak scene set in the future following a nuclear holocaust known as Judgment Day with some narration explaining how Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to the 90s to kill John Conner before he can become the savoir of the human race, but a reprogrammed Terminator is also sent back to protect John The two land in the present and obtain clothing and weapons and begin looking for Conner. After locating John at a video game arcade, both the Terminators find him and the T-800 engages the T-1000 and a chase commences. John and the T-800 escape and proceed to rescue John's mother, Sarah, from a mental hospital. Now, the trio just stop the T-1000 from carrying out his mission, destroy Cyberdyne and stop Judgment Day from happening.In the annals of sequels, there are only a few that have been able to take what made the first one so memorable and amplifies it to such a degree that it's able to be every bit great if not better than it's predecessor, Terminator 2 is one such film. Much like what Nicolas Meyers did with Wrath of Khan or what Denis Villeneuve did with Blade Runner 2049, James Cameron gives to us a true marvel of a movie that easily seems to outdo the first film where much like what he did with Aliens, Cameron simply takes the story from the first Terminator and makes it much more grander, multifaceted and thorough that it makes it damn near impossible for the following films in the series to even be what T2 has been able to do and they have mostly pale in comparison to what this movie has done. From start to finish, the movie is a masterstroke of film arrangement, with a series of scenes and sequences that seem to roll of one another like a domino set where every scene and every moment is put into motion and the story is always moving like a well-maintained car while Cameron beautifully handles everything without trying to cram too much stuff into the movie and slowing it down. While watching the movie, it becomes clear that James, being the genius filmmaker he is, was given a larger budget for the film and it really does show by contrasting the depressing opening scene in T2 with the first film's opening. James does the job effortlessly by showing the viewer a grim and desolate depiction of the future with such a intense level of skill that the whole scene has been craved into the mindset of a generation of movie-goers and it never fails to send a chill running down your spine. While the first Terminator was a straight-out sci-fi horror movie with a love story added in, T2 focuses on the importance and the difficulties of being a family as shown with Sarah being in a metal hospital and is unable to be there for her son and John searching for a father figure and finding one in the Terminator along with John teaching the T-800 how to be more human which remains the heart of the movie, in fact I wouldn't be surprised that The Iron Giant and Big Hero 6 drew inspiration from T2 in that respect. With that aspect of the movie in mind, a theme that flows though both Terminator movies is humans vs. technology as shown in the scene where Sarah Conner attempts to kill Miles Dyson as she doesn't bring into question ethics or morals showing how she is becoming more like a terminator but before she kills him, she comes to her senses and she sees what she's becoming. There's a moral tapestry that flows throughout the movie practically when John tells the T-800 that he just can't go around murdering people or when he's explaining why humans cry and curiously, it is John's teachings and the rebooting of his CPU that makes the Terminator more human and in the end, he realizes part of his humanity when he sees John crying and it makes his sacrifice all the more impactful and heartbreaking. A truly great hero in a movie is one who gives his life for a greater cause, something larger than his own life and while the T-800 could have lived, he decided to sacrifice himself for the future of human kind making him a true hero. Cameron chose to use this powerful moralistic issue in the film because he didn't want the Terminator murdering everybody and everything in his way, but rather weave this message into the story which many who watch the movie seem to overlook and it proves to be a very mystical feature of the movie and it makes the message of the movie all the more powerful. Of course, it wouldn't an action movie without action and Terminator 2: Judgment Day certainly delivers that in spades. Right from the moment the T-800 enters the bar and straight up hurls a man onto a hot stove, it's clear that the action isn't toned down like Die Hard 4 nor is it over-the top like Army of Darkness, rather it's the kind of action that always keeps you glued to the edge of your seat as you never know what will happen next and the movie has so many memorable action scenes from the wonderfully shot shoot-out in the hallway between the two terminators and the ensuing truck chase to the exhilarating and emotional climatic battle in a steel mill that few other action movies can even compete with it in terms of fast-paced action. While not all directors might be on James Cameron's level when it comes to filmmaking, that's a given, but any filmmaker who are looking at making action movies should take a careful look at the various other positives found in the filmmaking of Terminator 2: first off, not every action scene needs to be filmed with shaky cam or done in slow-motion in order to tell the viewer that the scene is impressive or critical as it can distracting for the viewer and takes them out of the moment. The cinematography in the film feels fresh and in depth where the viewer is able to see everything perfectly right down to the tiniest, most insignificant details, kudos to Adam Greenberg for that. The action scenes are cut to perfection with no jump cuts or messy editing to seems to be a trend in most action movies now a days. The visual effects are absolutely fantastic and still look just as revolutionary as they were back in '91 given how T2 was one of the big budget movies to use CGI, it just looks flawless as opposed to a lot of later big budget movies that have tired to used it but have mostly failed. The shots of the T-1000 changing are northing short of dazzling, masterful, and brilliant, particularly the moment of the T-1000 coming out of the ground or when the T-800 blasts the T-1000 to bits are the stand out moments in terms of visual effects mastery at work. Simply put, if Terminator 2 had never been made, we wouldn't have had the effects in Jurassic Park, The Matrix or Lord of The Rings. As for the musical score, it's truly a masterpiece of film composing as Brad Fiedel is able to outdo the score from the first movie The score for T2 is astonishing, conflicting and grim all at the same time with a ceaseless bass line that keeps the movie going with a relentless and pulsating drive that never seems to stop, even during the quiet moments plus the music at the opening of the movie is truly awesome in every single possible way as it gets kicks the film off on a musically high note. Not surprisingly, the film also a substantial amount of humor added in which does make the movie a bit more lighthearted than the first movie practically the scene where the T-800 is in a bar and takes a pair of sunglasses while Bad to the Bone is playing in the background, it's classic James Cameron humor at it's best.As for the cast of T2, they are all amazing in their roles and under Cameron's guiding hand, they give it their all. Linda Hamilton once again completely rocks it as Sarah Conner, going from a scared and naÃ¯ve heroine to a battled-hardened bad-ass with zero effect, but also willing to protect her son and even a bit crazy as seen when she attacks Miles Dyson and almost kills him but realizes the error of her ways which makes for some superb character development, something rarely seen these days in major action movies, but also maintains a surprising amount of defenselessness that makes Sarah such a captivating character and it's truly a shame that Hamilton hasn't been in other big character roles after T2, but at the very least, her performance as Sarah Conner demonstrates a strong woman hero who grows as a character and has an impact on the story at hand. Edward Furlong is down-right fantastic as John Conner playing a rebellious teen with ease but he's also capable of showing great emotional range as shown in the final scene as well as a fair amount of vulnerability, lovability, and intelligence while displaying sighs of the leader he will someday become. Easily one of the best child actor performances I've ever seen in a big budget movie which is rare. Robert Patrick as the T-1000 is the embodiment of what a truly great villain can be, he's restrained, stealthy, icy and determined with a cold dead look of anger on his face which always instills a sense of dread whenever he's on screen but his personality is also simple and effective in his motivations and seems natural when talking to people rather than a full-on robot which makes him all the more threateni, intimidating and such a great villain, but out of all the actors in the movie, none are as awesome as Arnold Schwarzenegger as the T-800 and was born to play this role and while some may say that he isn't the best actor out there, the role seems tailor made for him, but with Cameron's directing, Schwarzenegger is able to give a truly wonderful performance by coming across",10,1,4,11 April 2018
Spider-Man," The web-heads triumphant debut on the silver screen
","When I was a kid, Spiderman was always a character that I was aware of, but never much cared for apart from the 90s animated show, so when I went to see the movie in the summer of '02, I was pretty excited to see it and it didn't let me down. From it's superb direction and themes to it's acting and effects, Spiderman is a revolutionary movie in the superhero genre. The movie follows a high schooler named Peter Parker who is an outsider and can't bring himself to open up to his childhood crush, Mary Jane, but after being bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, Peter discovers that he has gained new abilities, but after his uncle is murdered, Peter decades to use his powers for good and learn what it means to have power and responsibility.One of the more difficult tasks with bringing a character like Spiderman to the big screen is to give the audience plenty of background information on the lead character in order for us to care about him because if there is too much focus on the heroes origin then it tends to slow the movie down but if the viewer is given too little then they won't connect with the hero. This is something Sam Raimi is able to hit the right notes with by setting up our hero in the few minutes of the movie as we see Peter as a nerdy outsider, allowing the viewer to get to know him better, while another part of the movie's charm is the grand and beautiful style added to it thanks to the bouncy and attentive directing from Sam and writer David Koepp's engaging dialog which allows the story to unfold and allows each character to develop as the movie progresses and while Koepp's script might have an out-of-date touch to it, it feels like Burton's Batman when it comes to format and dialog and can come across as a bit off-putting, it still adds to the movie's charms and makes it a lot more timeless. While Spiderman's origin is incredibly simple, it feels akin to Donner's Superman, telling the whole story of how the hero comes to be while Rami and Koepp approach the movie with a great deal of respect for the original 60s comic book by maintaining all the major elements of the story like the spider bite and Uncle Ben's murder but don't try to put their own spin on it, rather they adjust certain facts to apply to modern day and the end product is an enduring and touchingly inspiring origin perfectly suiting the character and Sam is able to get the tone of the movie just perfectly by letting the movie have a sense of fun, but never forgets the core message of the story and gives ample devotion to the serious stuff too.As for the look and feel of the film, Raimi takes great care to be as faithful to the world of Spiderman as possible and New York looks amazing, not even Batman's Gotham City bears a flawless harmony of elegance and reality that Raimi has made. Sam's trademark dynamic camera works fits this kind of movie perfectly and every single shot in the movie is full of momentum and a wonder to be hold. Sam's concept for Spiderman is also supported convincingly by some top-notch visual effects and action with Spidy swings though the Manhattan streets with agility and elegance and while some of the CGI is a bit wonky at times, the visual effects in the movie are flawless for the most part while Raimi provides us with plenty of entertaining battle scenes throughout the film, climaxing in a ferocious and grand face-off that's more extreme and primeval than most other action scenes in superhero movies. As with most comic book movies, Spiderman would be nothing without a stellar cast and it certainly delivers that in spades. Toby Maguire is an eye-opener as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Much like Robert Downey Jr. or Hugh Jackman, Maguire absolutely encompasses almost everything needed for Spiderman. He brings a good-heart-ed, timid, compassion to his performance but also skillfully portrays both the geeky side and heroic side of the character with remarkable ease while his enthusiastic looks assure the viewer that he looks like a teen, but even wearing the suit, Maguire exhibits a boyish boldness as well as a bit of innocence but nevertheless is fearless when he battles his foes, clearly Rami and Sony took a risk with Maguire and it pays off wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst is a believable Mary Jane and gives a wonderful performance plus the chemistry between her and Toby seems to ooze off the screen whenever they are together. James Franco is wonderful as Harry Osborn, bringing the character's conflicts with his father and his relationship with Peter to life in a wonderful way. Rosemary Harris is wonderful as Aunt May as is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons steals every scene he's in as the fiery and grumpy J. Jonah Jameson while on the other side of the coin is Willem Dafoe as the evil Green Goblin/ Norman Osborn. When he is Norman, Dafoe portrays a more fatherly figure to Peter while displaying sighs of what he will later become, but when he becomes insane, Willem fully grasps his madness and goes as over-the-top as one can go and uses a richer voice tone for Norman while using a hoarser voice and psychotic laugh for the Goblin without going too cartoonish but still maintaining a conniving and threatening persona that invokes dread throughout New York, truly one of the finest villains in all of comic book filmdom. If I did have an issue with the film, it would the Green Goblin suit as it does look like something out of Power Rangers, but apart from that, Spiderman is a truly fantastic comic book movie. Definitely one to watch.",10,0,0,11 November 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," Spiderman Begins
","Following the release of Spiderman 3, which was a major box office hit but was seen as a high letdown by most of the fan base, Sony Pictures and director Sam Raimi sent to work on making a fourth Spiderman film that would conclude Peter Parker's story arch as Sam felt he could right the wrongs of the previous film and give the fans the proper finale they wanted. However, Sony's meddling would sadly continue as producer Avi Arad and the other studio executives continued to pester Raimi with their own suggestions such as filming the movie in 3D and insisting on having Carriage in the movie. Things were made worse as Raimi hated every draft of the script that was given to him but that wasn't the only problem he had to deal with. Besides the non-stop meddling from Sony, another issue was the fact that the film's production was shaping up to be a mess despite the amount of talent involved as the film was being rushed for a 2011 release date with a lousy screenplay featuring a bleak story that would have divided audiences and the with the film being shot in 3D, that meant that Sam would have had to start shooting sooner in order for the film to be finished on time. With mounting pressure from the studio and the amount of work increasing on the film, Sam Raimi finally decided to jump ship and with no director, Spiderman 4 was canceled soon after. However, a plan was in place at Sony that would allow them to hold on to the Spiderman property until 2015. Screenwriter James Vanderbilt had already begun writing a treatment for a reboot of the character as Avi Arad wanted to do something akin to Batman Begins for Spiderman. Later on, Sony chairwoman Amy Pascal hired indie director Marc Webb to direct the film but Avi would insist that the film was an interquel likely dreading the hostile implications the term reboot had. Nevertheless, it appeared that Sony's reboot of the webhead paid off when the film was released in July of 2012. Despite some people complaining that the plot of The Amazing Spiderman was a carbon copy of the first Spiderman film from 2002, the film still did well with critics, audiences and the box-office.Now, my experience with The Amazing Spiderman is limited as I never saw the film in the theater when it first came out and given how I wasn't a big fan of comic book movies at the time, the film simply didn't interest me. However, a few years back, I decided to watch it in preparation for seeing Spiderman Homecoming and upon thinking back on The Amazing Spiderman, while there are things that I did enjoy about the movie such as the acting and the musical score, other elements like the story and characters left a lot to be desired in my eyes.The story opens with a young Peter Parker stumbling upon his father's research and seeing it burgled. Alarmed, Richard and Mary Parker gather up critical documents and take Peter to the home of his Aunt May and Uncle Ben and then depart. Years pass, and Peter now goes to high school where he catches the eye of Gwen Stacy. While at home, Peter uncovers his father's old documents and finds out that his father used to work with Dr. Curt Connors at a company known as Oscorp. Sneaking his way into the building, Peter creeps into a laboratory where he is bitten by a radioactive spider. On his way home, Peter gets into a fight with some thugs and discovers that he now has increased agility and strength. Now, with these newfound powers, Peter Parker dons a new identity to protect the city of New York as the hero Spiderman.The Amazing Spiderman feels like a mess of different ingredients into a pot, stir for 2 hours and yet it never comes close to other superhero films that came before it. While there are moments in the film that are great, they still pale in comparison to what Sam Raimi already did so perfectly with the first two Spiderman movies. No matter how hard Webb tries to make The Amazing Spiderman work as a film, there is just too much going on here for the story to find its' own footing. With the movie clocking in at 2-and-a-half hours, the movie feels like a superhero origins story and a separate adventure movie that isn't sure if it should tell Peter Parker's origin or just hustle through all the story points of one of the most recognizable superhero backstories in comics or if it's attempting to bring something much deeper to the table. When The Amazing Spiderman does get moving, it becomes a mildly entertaining film that tries to bring something new to the Spiderman mythos, but it still encounters the same identity crisis as Peter Parker and fails to find its' own style.One of the core ideas that dominate the story of The Amazing Spiderman is the concept of genetics being spliced together from different species to create something entirely new. In a way, the film feels like a gene splice of other movies as it seems that the writers and Avi Arad just took the gritty and grounded world of Batman Begins and the romance of Twilight and threw the two elements into the world that Sam Raimi had already built. Sure, The Amazing Spiderman does escape from a lot of the problems that the Twilight films had and replaces them with a slightly more cultured mindset. Now, comparing The Amazing Spiderman to Nolan's Batman Begins is an obvious flaw that the film has as Avi, Amy, and the other Sony executives clearly thought that making the film more dark and gritty would be beneficial to the story and their own coffers. However, it seems that they learned the wrong lessons from Nolan's Batman films as dark and gritty simply doesn't work for a character like Spiderman and the film's version of New York City reflects that. Sure, the three Spiderman films that Sam Raimi directed took place in New York too, but they were never set in a realistic version of the city. The first three Spiderman movies took place in a color-saturated version of New York that felt like a four-color painting brought to life. In contrast, The Amazing Spiderman's version of New York is ugly to look at. All the lighting has been turned way down and Spiderman now swings around at night. What is he, Batman now?! There's tons of polished glass and this version of New York City looks less like a thriving metropolitan area and more like an isolated place that has been disconnected from the rest of the world. It's a city of thieves and muggers, not street singers belting out catchy songs. Yeah, and people whined about Man of Steel being too much like Batman Begins in terms of tone.What's even darker is the character of Peter Parker. Now, I'm aware that in the comics, Peter was always portrayed as an orphan much like Bruce Wayne before him. Not that it's that big of a deal but the idea of Peter losing his parents at a young age means that he doesn't take the murder of Uncle Ben as personally as Bruce Wayne does as Peter just learned a lesson that he sometimes takes far too seriously. In The Amazing Spiderman, Peter is so distracted with finding out about his parents, uncovering his secret origin and attempt to find what happened to his mother and father. I've heard some people say this subplot does a decent job setting up his parents but I feel that since we never truly learn what Peter's parents are even doing and why they have to leave so suddenly, it does nothing for the overall story and just comes across as another meaningless subplot. The other issue with this plot point is that it weakens a lot of what Peter takes for granted. When people generally think about Spiderman, they think about a teenager taking care of his ill aunt, trying to pay his rent, continually gets kicked around by the world as he attempts to find his place in it. Unlike some other superheroes, Peter Parker is a blue-collar kid gifted with extraordinary abilities who has to juggle all the issues in his life, something that we saw in Spiderman: Homecoming that was done perfectly but here, we never really see this Peter Parker do that as he doesn't seem to have any motivations in the film. At first, it appears that he is attempting to find out what happened to his parents which doesn't go anywhere then half an hour later, he's now trying to control his new abilities in an ultimately pointless scene that does nothing for the story or the character. In the first Sam Raimi Spiderman film, Peter learned how to use and control his powers in a secure environment, not by beating the piss out of a few random thugs on a subway train. It's good to know that not one person even bothered to report that some teenager beat up 5 random hoodlums while climbing up a wall, but having Peter learn how to use his powers isn't enough as the film has to throw Uncle Ben getting shot in our faces again. However, this time, the film fails to make me care about Peter or Ben because Parker lets the felon go simply because he couldn't get chocolate milk. To get that angry all because he didn't have enough money for chocolate milk that Peter would allow a criminal to rob the store and get away is nothing short of the plan of three writers and a studio executive who simply do not understand the characters of Spiderman and Peter Parker and another reason why this incarnation of Peter Parker is unlikable and not worthy of any sympathy from me. So, ten minutes later, we see Peter looking for the criminal and trying to bring him to justice rather than allow the police to handle this and then after a while, the film loses interest in that subplot and jumps over to Dr. Curt Connors who has now become The Lizard. Does he have any character, any motivations, any personality? The writers, Arad, and Webb don't seem to know or care so why should I. The plot is such a disjointed mess that it's a miracle that I was able to even enjoy watching this movie but then again, at least The Amazing Spiderman wasn't boring like Batman V Superman or Frant4sic.Another big issue that the film makes is having Peter's powers become a gift. He gets bitten by a spider bearing a blueprint",7,0,2,5 June 2019
The Lego Movie," One of the most creative and refreshing movies of the decade.
","When I first saw the trailers for the Lego Movie, I scoffed at it, thinking that it would be nothing more than a gigantic toy commercial for Legos, but much to my surprise, when I sat down to watch it earlier this year, what I got was a thoroughly creative and fun movie that seemed to resonate more with adults than with kids.In a world populated by Lego figurines, the malicious Lord Business discovers a weapon known as the 'Kragle', but the wizard Vitruvius tries to stop him only to be left vision-less by Business's robots; he foretells of a being called 'the Special' will acquire a block known as the Piece of Resistance and stop the Kragle. Some years later, an ordinary construction worker named Emmett Brockowski encounters a woman named Wyldstyle at his job and while trying to follow her, falls into a pit and locates the Piece of Resistance, proceeds to touch it then wakes up with the piece fixed to his back, in the captivity of Bad Cop. Wyldstyle then saves Emmett, certain that he is the Special, takes him to meet Vitruvius in the Old West. Now, Emmett, Wyldstyle and the rest of the master builder community must untie in order to stop Lord Business from executing his plans.Given that the story does follow the Matrix in a lot of ways, it would seem like it would be retreading the plot of the 99' movie a bit too much, yet when you see the Lego world, everything in it feels original and hot off the press, something I wish more kids movies would do rather than rehash the same ideas over and over again and it seems that Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the two guys who gave us 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and the Jump Street films, and the writers really knocked out of the ballpark with this one.When it comes to the animation, The Lego Movie has some of the best seen in the last few years and is great enough to rival Disney or Pixar. Not only does it have the look of a beginners stop-motion movie with a high budget, but the magnitude of the detail and the imagination put into the animation is nothing short of amazing rather than just using some cheap CGI. At some points throughout the movie, there's simply so much going on that it's pushing overwhelming limits, yet if one is a careful observer, they might see that every single little item from the people to the sky are built in Lego pieces. The numerous ways the Lego world moves, crumbles, is built again, crumbles apart and changes is just a delight to see. The usage of items from the real world being used in the Lego universe is guaranteed to get a massive chuckle out of anyone watching the film, and the aftereffect is a movie that looks so unlike any other movie we've seen before.The script is a non-stop thrill ride of one sidesplitting gag after another not to mention the jokes often come at you so quickly that it's impossible to get them all the first time you watch the movie, and blink and you'll-overlook-it quips that litter the screen. No joke ever seems to overstay it's welcome or is overdone or overstated with some of the best jokes come from Emmett and well as from other characters throughout the film. One thing that the movies so expertly well is how it pokes fun at the whole prophecy story line that has been such a mainstay in big Hollywood movies and the way that they handle it is both hilarious and yet feels new. There are also quite a few pop culture references ranging from Star Wars to The Terminator and The Dark Knight sprinkled thought-out the movie too.The characters of the Lego Movie are a lot of fun to watch and the assemble cast is one of the best in an animated film since Toy Story: Chris Pratt is the prefect choice for Emmett, playing the eager and innocent sides of the character with ease, manages to be in incredibly funny often getting some of the movie's best jokes and also shows quite a lot of character growth as he learns how to think for himself rather then conform. While I'm not a big fan of Elizabeth Banks, she is awesome in this movie as Wyldstyle, hurling out plenty of sharp quips and kicking ass when she needs to, but she is also so much more than that by being more of a symbol of individually which is an interesting take on a female lead in this kind of movie and certainly better than having her hook up with Emmitt at the end. Morgan Freeman is always excellent is anything he's in and here, he brings the same wise-man vigor as Vitruvius while almost making fun of the other mentor roles he's played in other movies and is truly a delight to watch. Will Ferrell is completely devilish and threatening as Lord Business and yet is a complete laugh riot, channeling his Mugatu character from Zoolander with ease. Charlie Day is a joy as the Lego spaceman Benny, Nick Offerman is great as Metalbeard, Alison Brie is enchanting as Unikitty, Liam Neeson is down right hilarious as Good Cop/Bad Cop, but it's Will Arnett as Batman who steals the movie as there are simply too many times in the movie where he has a line of dialog that makes every intentional funny scene even more laugh-out-loud funny.I really don't have any negative things to say about the Lego movie, it's just superb with great characters, top-notch animation and voice acting, wonderful jokes, and one hell of a catchy song. Definitely a movie worth checking out.",10,1,2,23 May 2017
Aliens," All hail James Cameron.
","All hail James Cameron.Much like Alien, my experience with its 1986 sequel, Aliens is limited to non-existent as I never watched it growing up mostly because I was far too young to even see it even if I had wanted to. However, as I got older and began to hear other people comment on how excellent the film was, I felt compelled to give Aliens a watch and lo and behold, I absolutely loved it. From its solid direction and writing to it's wonderfully executed action and top-notch performances, Aliens is a movie that stands head and toes above its predecessor in every possible way.The film opens with Eileen Ripley drifting in space while in stasis for 57 years but is rescued by a deep-space salvage team and taken to a space station above Earth. While recovering, she learns that her daughter has passed away. Later on, she is questioned by her employers of the Weyland-Yutani Corporation as to why she destroyed The Nostromo. Ripley tries to explain what happened but the company don't believe her and revoke her pilot license. Meanwhile, on the planet LV-426, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation has established a terraforming colony but when contact with the settlement is lost, a representative named Carter Bruke asks Ripley for help. Ellen is reluctant is take part in the operation due to her previous encounter with the beasts but after Burke reassures her that the mission is to wipe the creatures out, she agrees. On board the USS Sulaco, Ripley meets the Colonial Marines along with the android Bishop who Ripley is at first hostile to due to her previous experience with Ash. The team soon descends down to the planet's surface and enter the compound where they find signs of a struggle but no bodies apart from a devastated young girl named Newt. The group then processes to the center of the compound where they find the settlers cocooned. After the marines kill a chestburster, the rest of the aliens emerge and attack the squad, killing several. When the inept Lieutenant Gorman panics, Ripley drives the transport into the hive to save the remaining marines. Now, the survivors must find a way to get off the planet before it's too late.In the world of moviemaking, creating the perfect sequel that is able to match the first one is never an easy task to pull off and every guideline that dictates such actions always has a number of exemptions to this rule. Empire Strikes Back had a different director working on the movie and it turned out fantastic, Evil Dead II was just the first movie with a bigger budget and more comedy while Terminator 2 was a much larger film with bigger action and a more human story then what the first Terminator was. Aliens go against all of those rules mostly with the rule of not amping up the action in an effort to have a majority draw. Having shown in The Terminator that he could handle both captivating sci-fi themes as well as nerve-racking tension, James Cameron was the right guy to carry the story set by Ridley Scott's 1979 classic upon his shoulders onwards and adjust it for the 1980s action crowd and while the movie is not as frightening nor as satisfying as Alien, it nevertheless endures as an appealing and smart action film that doesn't insult or talk down to its audience unlike action movies like Transformers: Age of Extinction or Robocop 3.Out of all of Cameron's films, there are several that are always battling each other for the top stop and while I will say that Terminator 2 is easily Cameron's best movie in terms of story and themes, Aliens is easily more accessible and easier to watch than other sci-fi movies like Avatar or Passengers. Disregarding the movie's place within a quintessential film series, Aliens serves as a practical handbook on how to adequately build a movie, from the screenplay to directing the action and everything else in between. It's difficult to see Aliens as anything less than a total cinematic achievement, no matter what standpoint you see the movie from. Cameron's choice to take the Alien series from horror to action seems a bit bewildering to those who haven't watched the first film. Nowadays, action movies like Skyscraper, A Good Day To Die Hard and the Fast and the Furious movies have become identified with idiotic and cheesy dialog, cardboard characters, redundant storytelling and horribly shot action scenes that it's now easy for audiences to forget the brilliance and improvements directors like Cameron, Spielberg, and McTiernan brought to the genre. As Dan O'Bannon said, taking the story Alien established and turning it into an action film was the best route to take the series. Had that not happened, the series would have become the next Halloween, creating more of the same unoriginal and unfrightening horror films lacking any of the passion or creativity that made the first film work so well.It's often be argued whether Alien or Aliens is the better film. In my personal opinion, I gravitate more towards Aliens due to its more accessible story and more fleshed-out characters but it's never an easy decision as both are perfect examples of two very different kinds of filmmaking as well as both films being notable enough to stand on their own as fairly stand-alone movies. While Alien and Aliens may share a lot of the same story points, visuals, and the same lead character, they are both entirely different movies from one another as Ridley Scott's Alien is a haunted house in space while James Cameron's Aliens is a futuristic war movie with elements of horror added in. While there are obvious spheres of overlapping from both films, there are also key contrasts too as both Scott and Cameron use horror differently. Ridley's version of Ellen Ripley is able to survive due to her rejecting the conformity of the womanlike trope of being the scream queen or the victim while Cameron's version of Ripley is able to destroy the alien queen by grasping her stand-in family with Newt being her daughter, Hicks being her husband and Bishop being the loving uncle.However, regardless of how fantastic the story is, it's also how Aliens is built up in terms of its pacing that make it so great. It would be fairly bad if one assumed that the attention given to the events unfolding as well as the mainstream appeal would mean that the world of Aliens and Ellen Ripley would be lacking any kind of development, but much like what Nolan did on Batman Begins or what Joss Whedon did on The Avengers, it takes almost an hour until the main action even gets going and yet, the viewer is never left feeling bored. Like Alien before it, Aliens takes its time setting up its surroundings as well as its characters. It doesn't rely on hitting the viewer over the head with explaining Ripley's backstory to us as the movie does a wonderful job showing us all the events that have taken place since the first film. Unlike a director like Roland Emmerich, James Cameron actually takes the time to build up and develop the cast of characters. Sure, the Marines may come across to some as generic but at the very least they feel like actual characters with a part to play in the movie rather just be irritating comic relief or just there to be used as cannon fodder for the plot's convenience unlike a movie such as The Patriot. The amount of detail and thought that went into creating the characters as well as building the world of the film is nothing short of astonishing and pays off handsomely by the time the final action set-piece rears its head. That is a testament to the airtight screenplay that Cameron wrote himself as well as throughout the film, Cameron arranges the scenarios that the characters find themselves in and the outcomes of those situations so beautifully, bringing in ideas like the damaged nuclear reactor and the motion trackers in intelligent ways long before they can give the viewer any sort of exciting finale.All this may feel like a standard storytelling approach that could apply to any movie, but I personally believe very few directors can pull this off as well as James Cameron can. Hell, it's one of the main reason why even casual moviegoers are able to be engrossed by Cameron's films so easily even more so than a Spielberg or a J.J. Abrams movie. It's his gift for incredible storytelling and quality filmmaking that have made films like Terminator 2: Judgment Day and True Lies connect with audiences and critics as well as earn high amounts of money. It's also because much like the Indiana Jones and Star Wars films, all of Cameron's films are completely approachable to a vast majority of people and demographics which again shows how gifted James Cameron is in all of those departments even if some of his films don't always have the amount of quality and passion behind them. In my personal opinion, Aliens is everything Avatar tried to be but failed at being. One of the best things about the film series is that each of the movies has it's own definite visual style while having a different director working on each movie. While Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection aren't held in high standards when it comes to the franchise, one can't disagree that all four movies have a quintessential visual style that compliments the director behind the camera even if the final film isn't up to par with what the first two movies are. Much like the beasts themselves, the films are flexible and sensible as well as being able to superbly imitating Fincher's or Scott's styles behind and in front of the camera.In the case of themes and messages, Aliens delivers a surprisingly complex moral on commercial greed and corruption, something Cameron would explore again in Avatar even though I personally feel that Aliens has a better handle on its messages more so than Cameron's later film does and doesn't rely on the standard 'white guy falls in love with a women from another culture and becomes part of that culture all while his fellow men wage war on the tribe.' troupe that both Avatar and Dances with Wolves",10,0,4,1 December 2018
Captain America: Civil War," Heroes will fall.
","Following my viewing of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I couldn't wait to see what lay in store for Steve Rodgers so when the first trailer for Captain America: Civil War dropped, I was ecstatic to see it given how big of a fan of the MCU I am. So in May of 2016, a friend and I went to go see it and I left the theater awestruck at what I had just witnessed and after rewatching it in preparation for Avengers: Infinity War, the movie still holds up albeit with a few small flaws. From its complex themes, incredible action and acting, Captain America: Civil War is another gold standard for the MCU and comic book movies in general.The film begins in 1991 where an indoctrinated Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier is sent to track down a car transporting cases of serum for super-soldiers. We then cut to one year following the events of Age of Ultron where Cap, Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow attempt to stop former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Brock Rumlow from pilfering a biologic weapon, only to have Rumlow blow himself up and in the process, the team accidentally kill several Wakadan citizens. Following this, US Secretary of State Thunderbolt Ross visits the Avengers in Upstate New York and tells them that in light of recent events involving superheroes and the collateral damage they've caused, the United Nations are preparing to pass the Sokovia Accords, which will place the team under UN control only to be used when the UN feels it is necessary. The team is split over this new turn of events. Tony Stark, having remembered what happened in Sokovia and his role in creating Ultron agrees to the accords while Steve is reluctant to sigh, having more faith in the superhero community rather than the government. But just before the accords are about to be approved at an embassy in Vienna, the building is bombed and Bucky is blamed. Among the dead is the King of Wakanda, T'Chaka whose son T'Challa swears vengeance on Barnes. Steve, now aware that his friend is still alive goes after Bucky but the two are apprehended and placed under arrest. Now, the Avengers must take decide who to stand with as Tony and Steve come closer and closer to waging war on each other while a villain determined to see the Avengers fall orchestrates a devious plot.Back in the 1940s, it was so much more simple to distinguish who was good and who was evil when watching a movie but now, it's become much more complicated when assessing the events that have happened in previous MCU movies. The threats the heroes must face in these films have become so unlike anything else in previous superhero movies and some of these calamities have been carried out unintentionally by those heroes who seek to only do good in the world only to bring death and ruin as shown by Captain America and his team. The discussions on how to react or handle such a powerful group of individuals let alone control them is certainly compelling and fascinating as there are both pros and cons to each sides' argument as Tony strictly believes that The Avengers need to be kept in check following the events of the previous movies which is also driven by his guilt over unleashing Ultron upon the world while Steve is far more hesitant to do so due to what he dealt with in Winter Soldier and is compelled by the belief of superheroes operating without the consent of the government which is an interesting and thought-provoking idea and it helps to build upon the friction that's existed between Stark and Rogers since the first Avengers movie not to mention this animosity between the two serves the story well and proves a solid foundation from which future films in the MCU sprout from.The way the characters are handled here is nothing short of perfect as The Russo Brothers along with screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFreely have taken the time to make sure that each character, be them hero or villain, has just the right amount of development as well as giving each a chance to have their moment on screen rather than have a vast amount of characters on screen at once thus making it impossible for the audience to really care about them, something X-Men 3 and Batman V. Superman did too much of and therefore, the audiences failed to care about the characters in those movies but with Captain America: Civil War, such is not the cause as I actually cared about all the characters and I understood most of their motivations clearly. When we first met Tony Stark at the start of the MCU, we saw him as an egocentric billionaire playboy who made weapons for the government but when he discovers that his weapons are being used for, Tony sees just how shady the government is and by Iron Man 2, he has come to distrust the government or any sort of authority. In the Avengers, he hacks a S.H.I.E.L.D computer system to discover defiled government files to which he says that an intelligence department that is scared of knowledge isn't a good organization. However, following the events of the first Avengers and Iron Man 3, Tony begins to feel like he's losing his grip on the Avengers which leads him to create Ultron which also leads to the death and devastation in Sokovia which in turn leads a character who never trusted the government now realize that he now needs to be put in check. Stark's whole character arc during the course of the MCU is him being more accountable and responsible for his actions so in light of that, is it really fair to assume that all other superheroes should be kept in check as a result of one man's blunder? As for Steve Rogers, the first Captain America movie give him a chance to be the hero he was meant to be while the Avengers provided him with an opportunity to prove himself in the modern world. Winter Solider gave him some much-needed character growth and showed us some of the tension going on within him that we never saw in the first two films. With Captain America: Civil War, the viewer sees Rogers at his most conflicted as he struggles even further with this new burden as well as showing a fair amount of new character growth that we have yet to see in the MCU. To add to that, Steve's enduring nature and desire of not wanting to concern anyone else with the conflict surrounding Bucky Barnes brings his character full circle. It's precisely what a person from the 1940s would do and what a person who is devoted to their friends would do 'until the end of the line.' The inner turmoil that Rogers faces along with his moralistic self-freedom combined with a never give up demeanor is what makes the character of Captain America so charismatic and engaging but also provides a solid foundation for the movie's major battle to be built on which makes for a more intriguing story rather than what Batman V. Superman tried to do. Now we come to Bucky Barnes aka The Winter Soldier who may seem like the villain of this whole predicament but as it turns out, he comes across more as a victim due to the brainwashing Hydra subjected him to. Out of all the characters in the MCU, Bucky has one of the best character arks. As the Captain America films progress, the viewer saw him mature from being a sidekick in the first to being an indoctrinated assassin/pawn to becoming something in-between here and while we see clues throughout the film that his story has yet to be concluded, it was wonderful to see Bucky be conflicted about his past coming back to haunt him and see his relationship with Rogers grow. The story he is given here borders on harrowing and since we've seen his story unfold over the course of the last two Captain America films, the viewer is also feeling the effects of Barnes' story. It isn't so much that Barnes is a tragic hero like Anakin Skywalker, but rather it's the effects of what he has done in the past and how they have changed him that his character ark so memorable here. As for the villain for the picture, Helmut Zemo, he is at once dangerous as he is being ambiguous in a way no other villain in a Marvel movie has ever been before, not to mention he accomplishes his motivations without the aid of any superpowers much like what The Joker did in The Dark Knight. Rather than feeling like your depthless and two-dimensional villain that is seen far too often in movies these days, Zemo actually feels like a fairly unassuming threat to the Avengers and while he's nowhere near the threat that Loki or Thanos pose, he still proves to be a major damaging force to the team. rather than be a villain obsessed by word domination or money, here he's a man overpowered by his own anger and his lust for vengeance and will stop at nothing until he gets it and thus makes him of the best villains in the whole of the MCU.The film also brings up interesting questions that are thought-provoking as well as serving the story at hand rather than do what Batman V. Superman did where those same ideas are bogged down with pretentious themes lacking any real-world consequences while Captain America: Civil War fully embraces it's themes and uses them to great effect not just for the purpose of telling a story but also to make the viewer think. How far should defensive methods be placed on those who mean well but cause considerable amounts of destruction? Who should be held responsible for the damage caused by superhumans? Do the disadvantages of having superheroes fighting to save those in need counterbalance the advantages? Can the world put their trust in The Avengers when they are under the control of the UN? What if the UN sends the team to a place where they have no interest in going or what if there's an issue in a country like Iran or North Korea that requires the Avengers' presence but the accords won't allow them to interfere? All these questions that the movie raises as well as the contrast in every facet of the story is what makes this movie so wonderful and gripping to watch. Throughout the movie, The viewer is torn between choosing which side to stand with and which ideas they support",10,0,1,5 September 2018
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Intelligent and refreshingly original.
","When it came to comedy in my younger days, I always watched movies that make me howl with laughter like Ace Ventura or Animal House, but when my parents recommended The Grand Budapest Hotel, I watched the trailer and it peaked my interest and I later watched it and absolutely adored it. From it's ingenious writing and glorious visuals to it's comedy and acting, this is what so many modern comedies aspire to be and yet always fail.The movie opens in modern day where a young woman reads from a book by an author who vacationed at a run-down hotel in the Republic of Zubrowka called The Grand Budapest Hotel in the 1960s where he encounters the owner named Moustafa who tells him the story of how he inherited the hotel. We are than again thirsted back to 1932 where the Grand Budapest's attendant, M. Gustave is busily attending to the desires of the hotel's rich customers as well as educating Moustafa who is the hotel's new lobby boy, but when a favorite client of his is killed under questionable conditions, he is framed for killing her and is placed under arrest but is able to escape. Now, Gustave and Zero must clear his name and reclaim what is rightfully his.While on the surface, the movie may seem like a zany comedy with a murder thrown in for good measure, it's actually a series of arranged events in which many people tell the story of M. Gustave over the years while the extraordinary intro hints at the boundless creativity of director Wes Anderson. Some viewers might think that it's pointless, but it does give a lot of background when the last title card shows up, summing up the reason for the time skip, but it doesn't let up as the movie is a comical multiple genre journey that never seems to slow down for a breather, but even when it gets to the tense moments, there's always a sense of cheeriness right up until the movie ends. Much like what Quentin Tarantino did with Inglorious Bastards with it's self-awareness and adjusting of history, it's hardly surprising that Wes Anderson added in references to WW II throughout the movie as it's based off of a few books by author Stefan Zweig which adds to the authenticity of the movie not to mention that throughout the movie, the war rushes our heroes and villains to carry out their motives rapidly in order to accomplish their various ambitions which adds to the authenticity of the movie.While the human characters are fascinating, The Grand Budapest Hotel feels like a character itself with its spectacular setting, the baths, the hallways, tall roofs, soft colors and identical carpets and walls all give the viewer a sense of grandeur and awe making the viewer feel like they are actually staying there while the visual landscape and photography is simply gorgeous and not only ingenious in approach but also beautiful in gorgeous and smooth editing not to mention the production design, the clothes, hair and make-up all justly earned their Oscar wins as they encompass a distinctively bright and enchanted aura to them while at the same time giving meaning to the gloomy aspect that mirrors the crime drama characteristics of the movie wonderfully. The musical score by Alexandre Desplat is also wonderful with its memorably compelling and captivating musical themes while the film's score crafts a whole new setting for the movie's characters to thrive in and the themes for the various characters are just as attention-grabbing. While the movie has an undercurrent of seriousness, it's still a laugh riot and there's pretty to chuckle at in the movie from Gustave's prison breakout scene to him and Zero fleeing across the snow. The characters are portrayed to such excessiveness that it's impossible not to be entertained by watching them in spite of the dangers they face, the witting too is marvelous with plenty of hilarious lines that are bound to make you laugh your head off more times than once during the movie.To make the movie complete, Anderson recruited one of the best ensemble casts for a comedy I've ever seen and everyone is perfect in their roles. Saoirse Ronan is wonderful as pastry chef Agatha, Tilda Swinton leaves a wonderful impression as Madame D and gives a fine performance, Jeff Goldblum is fantastic as a doomed attorney, Bill Murray is great in his role as is Owen Wilson, Edward Norton is great as the police chief, F. Murray Abraham is wonderful as the older Moustafa, Adrian Brody is awesome as Madame D's conniving son while Willem Defoe is perfect as the evil and brutal psychopath especially when he's standing in the shadows and endangers unsuspecting targets. Ralph Fiennes is fabulous as M. Gustave and brings his familiar endurance to this outlandishly bizarre character, but in a comical curve puts on a formal yet amusingly vulgar witty persona that is more than captivating and there's no absence of hilarious dialog coming from his mouth as he spouts passionate poetry, biting banter or distasteful fits of swearing, truly one of the finest comedic performances of the decade. Assisting in Ralph's crazy adventures is the inexperienced yet ever devoted Zero, perfectly acted by Tony Revolori who brings a dash of boyish zazz to the role as Zero learns his surroundings, but we do learn about his troubled past later on in the film not to mention the interaction between him and Fiennes is so heart-melting as it feels like a father-son relationship by the movie's end.Honestly, there's nothing else I can say about the Grand Budapest Hotel, it's a wonderful comedy that provides plenty of laugh-out-lord moments but still manages to stand above most other comedy movies by being intelligent with it's writing, characters and humor, so if you want a comedy movie that won't insult your intelligence than this is your movie.",10,3,4,22 October 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Days of Hollywood Past.
","Ever since watching Pulp Fiction in late 2017, I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino and his filmography. As a director, Quentin is nothing short of masterful in the realm of storytelling and as a writer, he's one of the best at writing dialogue and referencing pop culture in a way that sounds natural and helps the story rather than just trying to be trendy as well as his ability to writing flawed yet likable and charismatic characters as shown in Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill films. So, when I heard that Tarantino would be making a film about Hollywood in the late 1960s and would focus on the Charles Mason murders, I was pumped beyond belief so when I did see the film in August of this year, I came out a bit perplexed but happy by what I had seen. Despite a few small issues, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a masterclass in filmmaking and shows why Tarantino is one of the best directors working in Hollywood today.The film opens in early 1969 where Hollywood actor Rick Dalton, star of a 50s' western show, worries that his career may be ending and casting agent Marvin Schwarzs suggests that Dalton star in Spaghetti westerns but he refuses to do so. Rick's friend and stuntman, Cliff Booth serves as Dalton's driver due to his alcoholism resulting in numerous DUIs. Meanwhile, actress Sharon Tate and her husband Roman Polanski move in next to Dalton. Now, Dalton and Cliff must find a way to reinvent themselves as the Hollywood landscape changes before their eyes amongst a background of changing tastes and sinister people.Simply put, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is a fantasy, no question about it. The mystery at the heart of the film lies in reuniting both its adulthood as well as its innocence. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood has notably marketed as Tarantino's next to last film even though there's an awful lot of back and forth on that matter as well as being packed with a proper sadness. This sadness is reflected in a number of a different way, most apparently in the movie's 1969 setting. Here, Tarantino brings the Los Angeles of the late 1960s to life from the drive-in movie theaters and Old West film sets to celebrity parties at the Playboy Mansion. The majority of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood takes place over the course of one weekend in early 1969. The story gives us exact dates with a clear purpose as the film begins a mere 6 months before the Manson Murders occur. To some, these killings marked the end of the 60s along with the hippie culture and the hope and optimism that movement had fostered. As such, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like a countdown to the end of an era both for Hollywood and for the 60s as a whole. A lot of the film feels like a death march setting up an evitable end. When watching the movie, the viewer gets the sense that there is something sad happening within this world.There's no shortage of self-importance and narcissism in the claim that the 1960s ended simply because of a few savage murders in Hollywood that involved a couple of celebrities. Given how much of the mess the USA was in 1969, it's not really surprising as US troops were slogging it out in Vietnam and Nixon had just become president. Hell, Warren Beatty actually based the film Shampoo around the Manson victim Jay Sebring, and actually considered adding to his murder, however Beatty felt that this would portray a very selfish history of the late 60s and, instead built the film around the idea that celebrities were removed from what was actually happening in the world. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood only briefly explains any kind of reality outside of the glitz and glamor of Hollywood as there are some faint news reports of the chaos unfolding on the outside being heard through a car radio. Receiving a ride from Dalton's stunt man Cliff Booth, a young hippie complains that actors only mimic reality while people are dying out in the real world. Of course, this young lady is being a complete bigot as she's part of the Manson Family, a cult built around Charles Manson whose brutal actions were entrenched by his own failed attempt at stardom and whose crimes targeted celebrities while on a hunt for celebrity status.So there is a sense of fulfillment in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in the form of the same kind of self-praise that one would expect from a movie made Hollywood about Hollywood. Now, to be fair to Tarantino, the film is intelligent enough to wear its viewpoint on its sleeve and also remain shrewd enough to ever-so-slightly hide its romanticizing of history. Even more than that, Tarantino has a filmography that is largely rooted in virtuous anger and avenging bloodshed, so the kindness and sympathy of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels very much like an understandable end-of-career exercise in self-praise. Indeed, your opinion on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood will depend on the degree that you are able to handle Tarantino's style as there are a fair amount of people who aren't fans of his style of filmmaking or storytelling but in my case, I happen to love Quentin's style when it comes to story and characters. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is an astonishing work of kindness and understanding. Tarantino's gift for sympathy has always been something unnoticed by film audiences and critics alike, maybe because his sympathy tends to be in league with characters who have done terrible things to those who in turn have done terrible things to them in return. In Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, that sympathy feels a lot more hazy and philosophical. In its own right, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the most sincere Tarantino film since Jackie Brown.Of course, the big question with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is if the audience can or is able to connect with Tarantino's sympathy as most all the subjects of his sympathy are completely deserving of it. In the case of filmmaking, making your characters sympathetic and relatable is critical in getting the audience to care about them. If the viewer doesn't emphasize or care about the lead hero or what stakes he or she must face then in my opinion, the film has failed and no matter how hard the director and writer may try to make the viewer care about the protagonist, they won't be invested in the character or their journey if the lead isn't empathetic. Thankfully, Quentin Tarantino is a master of this as Once Upon a Time in Hollywood gives us one of the best lead heroes in any Tarantino film in the form of Rick Dalton. Dalton is portrayed as a has-been cowboy actor who feels out of place with the changing landscape of Hollywood in the late 60s and it is this pain that shows itself most prominently in a scene where Rick appears on a teen show but also in his distaste for hippies. Dalton drinks too much, is erratic in his behavior, too worried about his image as an actor and horribly out of tune with what is happening in Hollywood at this time. Early on in the film, casting agent Marvin Schwarzs suggests that Dalton should do Spaghetti westerns in order to keep his career afloat but Rick sees those as beneath his talent range and refuses. Even so, we can tell that Dalton is a good person at heart. He takes direction fairly easy, he sometimes falters in delivering his lines and feels bound by a foil of insecurity and practices his lines with the help of a tape recorder even if his drinking cleans that out of his mind.Now, compared to protagonists in other Tarantino movies, Rick Dalton isn't exactly the epitome of a perfect person but he isn't a terrible person either. Even more than that, he does try and he gets the job done. And given the fact that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood never seems to condemn Dalton. Some of the film's greatest moments are when we see Rick's fears show themselves in full force as an actor, capturing both his grasp on his current predicament as well as his dream of being something more than just an actor. As Rick purely comforts a young actress that he was never actually considered for Steve McQueen's role in The Great Escape, the viewer is allowed a peek into Rick's head to see a different version of the classic film. Dalton is the main driving force of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood but he isn't the only focal point for the movie's sympathy. Much has been said about how the film treats the character of Sharon Tate, most notably the film's habit of just focusing on her and not giving her much in the way of dialog but these objections are missing the point what Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is trying to do with the character of Tate. Sharon isn't really treated like a character here nor does the film try to make her out to be an emblem.Once Upon a Time in Hollywood never turns Sharon Tate into anything as stereotyped as a tragic symbol of classic Hollywood or the human manifestation of the late 60s nor does the movie never reduce Sharon to anything as lowbrow as what one might see in a Michael Bay film. There's a sense that the distance that the film is putting between itself and Tate is meant to respect her as a person rather than provoke newspaper gossip or rumors of any kind as well as avoiding overpowering her influence with Tarantino's creative voice. Instead, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood feels like an almost peaceful approach to the way it treats Sharon Tate and given what happened to her, it's for the best what the film and Tarantino do with her. The film plainly centers on Tate just being in the story rather than be the main focus of it. The majority of the film's story is disconnected from the Manson murders by a six-month gap so any time that it does spend with Sharon Tate is simply showing us a day in her life. Once Upon a Time in Hollywood doesn't treat Tate as a clone of Rick Dalton, declining to comment on the well-publicized issues that were troubling her at the time such as her battle to be taken seriously as an actress, the thought that she might consider retiring from acting and her problematic relationship with Ro",10,12,15,29 November 2019
X-Men: The Last Stand," A once great franchise takes a serious nosedive.
","Following the financial and critical success of X-men 2, Bryan Singer was keen on doing a third film that would conclude Jean Gray's transformation into the Dark Phoenix, unfortunately Fox CEO Tom Rothman would have none of it, given his hatred for comic book movies, Rothman sought to take over a year to hammer out a deal for Singer to direct the third movie while trying to micromanage the film as much as he could leading to a lot of stalling at Fox. Meanwhile, WB president Alan Horn was tempting Singer with the opportunity to work on Superman Returns for them which Singer agreed to and jumped ship on X-men 3 to go direct that movie instead which left Rothman shambling to find another director and eventually settling on Brett Ratner to direct and all the while rushing the production of the movie to meet its May 2006 release date.Now, I never saw X-men 3 in theaters in the summer of '06 given my disinterest in comic book movies at that time and given the backlash it revived upon its release from the fans, I stayed well away from it. However, in preparation for seeing Logan last year, I sat down to watch The Last Stand and after finishing the movie, I certainly didn't think it was as bad as some of the fans had made it out to because I definitely enjoyed aspects of it like the acting and the visual effects. However, I thought the story and characters left a lot to be desired. The movie opens with Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr meeting a young Jean Gray and invite her to join Xavier's school after being impressed with her powers. We then cut to 10 years later where a young boy named Warren Worthington is discovered to be a mutant and attempts to cut his wings off. We then cut to the present day where Worthington Labs has developed a vaccination that kills the X-gene and offers it to any mutant that wants it. While the cure appeals to some like Rouge, other mutants are alarmed by it which gives Magneto a reason to reform his Brotherhood of Mutants and oppose the cure. At the same time, Scott Summers is morning the loss of his fiancé, Jean Gray and travels to Alkali Lake where he sees Gray alive, but as they embrace, she kills him. Detecting trouble, Professor X spends Strom and Wolverine to investigate. Once they arrive, they find a lifeless Jean but no Scott. When the three return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains that when gave her life to save the team, she unintentionally freed an alternative personality known as the Dark Phoenix which Professor X had helped her suppressed but, once the personality reasserts itself, Jean goes psychotic. Now, The X-men must stop Magneto and his Brotherhood from waging their war all while confronting and stopping The Dark Phoenix from unleashing her true power upon the world. Given that Bryan Singer was off making Superman Returns, the directing duties fall on Brett Ratner and while he is a decent director, the tone feels off-putting as the movie feels more like a generic summer action movie with superheroes in it rather than a smart, thought-provoking comic book movie that the first two were not to mention Ratner comes off as incompetent and uninspired, feeling more like a hired gun Rothman used just to make the movie as opposed to someone like Singer who actually cared about the story and characters. Meanwhile, screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg, as well as Ratner, easily ignore or fail to address the many irritating plot threads in their own movie with one of the most blatant flaws being Xavier's death and while he certainly didn't deserve to get killed off, he absolutely brought it on himself. In spite of an incredibly weak dispute with Wolverine and hard-hitting yet flimsy allegations from Magneto, Charles never accepts any responsibility for his mistakes with Jean nor does he ever deal with any challenges and thus still imploring his pitiful protectiveness to a Jean Gray who is beyond saving at this point in the movie, he passes away with helpless determination and with no honor simply because he can't avoid his own arrogance and while his passing is heartbreaking, it would been so much better if Kinberg and Penn had made Professor X see the error of his ways. If Xavier's death wasn't stupid enough, his memorial and the following scenes are even worse. The memorial scene is short and mediocre while the very next scene has Hank McCoy suggesting that they close the school, an alternative Strom quickly dismisses. In the context of the moment, the viewer is supposed to feel enriched by this scene but instead feels deprived of what could be a powerful scene of the X-men mourning their fallen mentor and we are never able to truly feel the impact of Xavier's passing or to revel in his death but instead are just told that life will go on. Of course, if that wasn't moronic enough, even after watching Dark Phoenix kill his friend right in front of him, Magneto still carries out his plan even though Charles's death should have provoked him to at least rethink his whole agenda and while he doesn't take Charles's passing lightly, it still doesn't make any sense why he just decides to carry on with destroying the mutant cure nor does it make any sense why Juggernaut and Multiple Man just join Magneto's cause without even brothering to ask who he is or what his motivations are. Not to mention X-men 3 has some of the most incompetent writing I've ever seen in a superhero movie since Batman and Robin and it just makes me wonder how infinitely better the script could have been had Chris Claremont written it. As for the whole Dark Phoenix story arc, it's a complete and utter joke. Rather than have an alien consciousness process Jean, the writers, Ratner, and possibly Rothman decided to have it be a split personality in order to keep the tone of the movie more realistic which doesn't work at all as Gray returns with the powers of an insane demon rather than an invincible deity as well as it coming across as a severe misunderstanding of who Jean Gray is as a character. While her return is welcome, Jean is completely underused here and has absolutely no character and does nothing but stand around and to add insult to injury, she kills Cyclops approximately 10 minutes into the damn movie without any build-up. Now, I get that the movie isn't going to follow the comics note for note, but something that shouldn't have changed here is Jean's love for Scott and how it is though that that she is able to overpower the Phoenix Force and take her own life while in the movie, Jean just flat out kills Scott without giving it a second thought while when Wolverine tries to kill Jean in the comics, his love for her is what stops him from doing it yet in the film, the viewer is expected to be emotionally invested in the scene but given how Jean and Logan shared so little time together during all three X-men films and had no chemistry, it's impossible to feel anything for these two and even less then Wolverine does kill Jean which makes for a weak finale that lacks any strong emotional punches or moments. Thanks for that, Kinberg, Penn, and Ratner.Not only does the film feel the need to butcher one of the best X-men stories ever written but it also feels the need to throw so much into its 2 hour running time in order to try and please the fans but in doing that, the story and characters suffer as a vast majority of them aren't on screen long enough for the viewer to get to know or care about them. Much like what happened with Batman V Superman, Spiderman 3 and Amazing Spiderman 2, X-Men 3 becomes an overstuffed movie with too many subplots going on and not enough focus on the story at hand.  Rather than provide each hero and villain with at least some development or motivation, something Singer paid a lot of attention to on the first two films as did The Russo Brothers on Captain American: Civil War, Ratner and the writers feel the need to add in as many new mutants as possible without even trying to develop them as characters or their motivations as many of them are just in the movie for fan service rather than have any kind of importance to the overall story. Nightcrawler, one of the most intriguing characters in the film series, is absent from the movie with absolutely no explanation as to why he isn't there. Really, Kinberg and Penn, was an explanation for why Nightcrawler not being on the team anymore too much to provide?! Callisto is your stereotypical ghetto black woman with no personality, Multiple Man is completely useless as a character, Angel was focused on heavily in the marketing for the movie and was made out to be a big player but when he's in the actual movie, he does nothing, has no character and comes off as yet another pointless cameo for X-men fans to drool over. Rouge and Iceman have no development whatsoever here either as Rouge comes across as a wasted character who just wants to take the mutant cure so that Iceman will love her again which makes her out to be a self-pitying and selfish person rather than a fully fleshed out character. Iceman isn't really given much do ether, even if all the development that X-men 2 give him is still there as the writing makes him come across as a self-absorbed jerk who cheats on his girlfriend although he comes come into his own at the end of the move, it's sad to see such a great comic book hero like Iceman be given the treatment of not being able to really grow as a character due to incompetent directing and writing. As for Pyro, he's completely useless too and comes across as an arrogant know-it-all rather than a compelling villain and he doesn't even use his powers effectively, what a wasted opportunity. Mystique is completely wasted as well. Cyclops, who always seemed to get the short end of the stick in all three movies, is killed off ten minutes in with absolutely zero development or emotional impact which is made even more tragic because James Marsden was making Superman Returns at the same time so killing his character of",7,0,0,30 April 2018
Ghostbusters," A comedy that never seems to age.
","My first exposure to Ghostbusters happened when I was quite young and I do remember watching it a few times and rather enjoying it even if there were moments that scared the ever-loving crap out of me but as I got older, the film dropped out of my viewing radar until I decided to rewatch it last year and low and behold, it still holds up just as much as it did back in 1984. From it's ingenious mixture of horror and comedy to its perfect casting and catchy theme song, Ghostbusters easily stands head and shoulders above most of today's painfully unfunny comedies.The film starts with a ghost haunting an old library and freighting a librarian. Following this incident, three out-of-work parapsychologists named Peter Vankman, Raymond Stantz, and Egon Spengler, who have started their own business called Ghostbusters, are called in to investigate but are scared out of the library. Upon being fired from their jobs at a local university, the three move into an abandoned fire station and make it their base of operation. Meanwhile, a woman named Dana Barrett returns to her apartment and soon sees a carton of eggs cooking themselves on her countertop as an evil demonic spirit speaks the words 'Zuul'. Faced with the increased paranormal activity around New York City, the team hire another member named Winston Zeddmore but now they also must face an even greater threat then Dana is possessed by Zuul and prepares for the arrival of a Sumerian god known as Gozer and only the Ghostbusters can stop it.In light of the awful 2016 remake which felt more like an unintentional parody of a Ghostbusters movie, the original film still remains a high-water mark for comedies that deal with supernatural elements like Dogma, Young Frankenstein, and Beetlejuice. It's always been a hard nut to crack in terms of balancing the line between horror and comedy just right and while movies like Evil Dead II pulled this off perfectly, Ghostbusters remains the perfect cinematic model to use when it comes to approaching the area of supernatural comedy. Give how it was Dan Aykroyd who came up with the idea for a team of men traveling through time and different demotions hunting ghosts as well as writing the first outline for what the movie would later become, this idea is nothing short of interesting and original but when director Ivan Reitman got ahold of it, he told Dan to scale it back a notch and make it more grounded but nonetheless, it did provide a strong base for Reitman, Aykroyd, Harold Ramis as well as the rest of the cast to build upon and add in new ideas as they saw fit. Plus, the screenplay for the movie is a perfect example of how to do characters in a comedy without having them come across as painfully unfunny stereotypes or characters with no depth or personality. Over the course of the film, there are times where the character of Peter Vankman is doing things that any normal person would deem to be unappealing or downright offensive as shown in a scene where he deliberately gives a student a shock while carrying out a cognitive test. Now, does the scene make the viewer assume that Vankman is the kindest man on Earth? Not in the slightest. Does the moment make you believe that he is funny as all hell? Absolutely. Out of all of the characters in the movie, Vankman seems to be the one who grows the most as a person over the course of the story as he starts out as a flirting twit but once he meets Dana, he begins to change into a more bona fide and honorable character as well as having something worth fighting for ay the end of the film. As for the other Ghostbusters, they really don't get much in the way of development but with that being said, they really don't need any as they are flawless in their own right and have no reason to be developed. All four of the Ghostbusters are engaging, comical and serve the film's plot as they are needed. One thing this film does so much better than the remake was the handling of the character of Winston Zeddmore in that he isn't portrayed as a scientist but rather an average working-class guy who just needs a job which makes him a character anyone can relate to instead of a screaming African-American stereotype in the remake. Even the other side-characters like Janine Melnitz, Louis Tully, and Dana Barrett are great characters and they never feel like they overstay their welcome nor are they ever aggravating to the point of stupidity unlike some characters in recent comedy films. Something else that Ghostbusters does so it is making the lead characters the little guys who have to break the system and while the 2016 remake attempted to do the same thing, there it just felt automatically given to the 4 leads rather than have it be earned but in the '84 movie, that element of the story feels natural as the team really do feel like they are the underdogs as at first they all lose their jobs and are seen as deranged or hustlers by a large array of doubters. The '84 movie takes this idea even farther as by way of the character of Walter Peck: a pompous attorney for the EPA whose desire is to pull down the Ghostbusters at every turn and nearly achieves his goal. This idea not only provides the viewer a feeling that the team is doing battle against government officials and the order of things, it also gives the Ghostbusters some tangible blockades to conquer along with giving them the necessary character growth as a team. With the aid of Reitman and Ramis, Aykroyd grounded the movie's story in reality much in the same way Christopher Nolan would later do with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight so that not only do the Ghostbusters have to do battle with legislators, attorneys, and hotel supervisors while doing their job but also the world they inhabit looks real and lived-in rather than overly fanciful or dark and gritty. The romantic subplot between Peter and Dana is nicely handled as both characters have wonderful chemistry with each other and the romance never feels like it's just there for the sake of the plot not to mention Dana actually speaks like and acts like a real single woman in New York City which makes her character all the more likable and enduring and we understand why Peter is fond of her which is more than I can say for the overly-feminized and unlikable characters Paul Feig and Katie Dippold gave us in the remake. The romance between Vankman and Dana adds another grounded and adult aspect to the movie. Throughout the course of any action or action-comedy film, it's always a total blast to see the heroes having to something they shouldn't do in order to defeat the villain and save the day. Much like the air tanks in Jaws or Dr. Strange's plan in Avengers: Infinity War, the ex machine that will destroy Gozer is implied earlier in the movie. Not only is it essential to put your characters in a no-win scenario, but it's also a great innovation to have them win by shattering the rules. The crossing the streams idea isn't just a convenient resolution to the film's climax but it also adds to the movie's motifs of identity and anti- absolutism that run throughout the film. This is one of the many reasons why the original Ghostbusters is still seen as a beloved classic while the 2016 remake will likely continue to ridiculed and hated for years to come. Even though Dan Aykroyd required other people to help him get the story more grounded and less out there but simply put, there would have been no Ghostbusters if it wasn't for Dan and his zeal for the supernatural. The original movie never once demoralizes its ghostly aspects. Even those characters who are shown to be total cynics are soon convicted otherwise. The movie takes it's lore passionately and much of the movie's humor comes from how the characters respond to the eerie circumstances instead of the situations themselves. The Ghostbusters is in no way a camp movie but rather a supernatural comedy in the vain of what Tim Burton or Mel Brooks do with their films where the reaction is just as important as what we're seeing on screen. Even the arrival of the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man at the end battle is more of a joke about Ray's childhood naivetÃ© being used against the team. The film was realized by a man who wasn't just fascinated by the paranormal but also had a great level of admiration for it as well. Regardless of whatever idea a movie has, no matter how outlandish or far-fetched, the more genuine it'll be if you put the effect into your film's screenplay and make that idea come alive, then the more convincing your movie will be to the audience and the more they'll respond to it. Unlike some modern-day blockbusters who feel like they need to be dull and grandiose in order to give the impression that they're somehow deep and thought-provoking films like Batman V. Superman and therefore lacking in any sense of fun or excitement, Ghostbusters is both a hilarious and entertaining film about the supernatural world that is able to work without having to talk down to it's audience. The action set pieces of the team catching Slimer in the hotel and the scene of them battling Gozer and the Stay-Puff Marshmallow Man are all perfectly executed to a high standard and looks incredibly real as well as a lot of fun to watch instead of the giant CGI eyesore action set piece that the 2016 movie gave us. As for the visual effects, they may look cheesy by today's standards but they still work in the movie's favor when working with the more comical style as well as being compatible with the overall story. There are even some genuinely frightening moments in keeping with the horror aspects of the film such as the stop-motion Terror Dogs or the scene of Dana being processed by Zuul and while the scares are few and far between, they still work wonderfully well. The soundtrack for Ghostbusters is composed by the great Elmer Bernstein and it's easily one of the best soundtracks for a comedy movie I've ever heard.

The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Too many hands in the pot.
","Following the release of the first Amazing Spiderman film in the summer of 2012, it was no surprise that Sony Pictures, producer Avi Arad and director Marc Webb began working on a sequel and given the strong box-office numbers the film pulled in, it showed that the webhead could stand on his own as a film property, independent from the greater Marvel universe. With this temporary success in mind, Sony made it evident that they had no plans to let Spiderman join the MCU thus while The Amazing Spiderman 2 was being made, Sony revealed release dates for two sequels with the intention supposedly being to move forward with a direct storyline akin to what Sam Raimi did with his Spiderman films. However, the plan changed yet again when Sony decided that the shared universe format that had worked so well for The Avengers would be applied to Spiderman and that The Amazing Spiderman 2 and its two sequels would be used as a starting point for various spin-offs. Thanks to the sudden shift from a contained story to a shared universe, director Marc Webb had his job cut out from him as The Amazing Spiderman 2 had a lot more to live to by the studio executives at Sony. Webb however, wanted to focus more on the plot point of Peter's parents but Sony wasn't playing ball here as they continuously twisted the script to tease more sequels and spin-offs which came at the cost of developing the story and its characters. Even Sony's CEO, Kaz Hirai supposedly had a hand in editing the film despite not having any experience in the field. The film was subject to a fair amount of behind-the scenes-middling from Sony and when the film opened on May 2nd, 2014, it was met with severely mixed reviews from both critics and audiences and was the lowest-grossing film out of the entire Spiderman filmography up to that point.Now, much like the first Amazing Spiderman film, my experience with The Amazing Spiderman 2 when it first came out is limited as comic book movies weren't my thing at the time so I never saw it in theaters. However, in early 2017 in preparation for seeing Spiderman: Homecoming, I decided to finally give the film a watch and much like the first film, there were elements that I enjoyed such as the acting and the musical score but many other aspects of the movie such as the story and characters left a lot to be desired in my eyes.The movie begins with Oscorp scientist, Richard Parker recording a message explaining his reasons for going into hiding. Later on, Richard and his wife, Mary are flying on a private jet when the two of them are attacked by an assassin and die in the ensuing plane crash. Years later, Richard's son, Peter Parker now fights crime in New York City as the hero Spiderman. After chasing a truck full of plutonium and apprehending the driver, Peter is able to make it just in time for his high-school graduation. While there, Peter breaks up with girlfriend, Gwen Stacy. Peter's childhood friend, Harry Osborne returns to New York to visit his dying father, Norman and upon his passing, Harry is named the new CEO of Oscorp. While working late one night, Oscorp employee, Max Dillon accidentally shocks himself and falls into a tank of electric eels and he becomes a supervillain. Now, with this new threat to face, Peter Parker now must don the mask to protect those he loves as more secrets about his own past resurface while more enemies begin to tear at Peter's world as it starts to crumble.
What is so unremarkable about The Amazing Spiderman 2 is how much it tries to feel like a comic book even if it isn't even close to having that kind of feel. Not that it's based on any of the Spiderman comic books themselves, even though there are numerous call-backs to memorable moments in the Spiderman mythos, even right down to the suit being pulled straight out of the comic pages rather than looking like a basketball like it did in the first Amazing Spiderman film. It isn't that Marc Webb is attempting to recreate the look and feel of a comic book as this isn't Ang Lee's Hulk or Into The Spiderverse, but instead, it again feels like Avi Arad and Sony bulling Webb at every turn to the point that Webb simply doesn't feel comfortable here as The Amazing Spiderman 2 feels more like a movie made by a committee rather than a movie with a story and characters the audience can be invested in and root for.Take all the blatant problems that the first Amazing Spiderman film had such as the plethora of set-up and subplots that go absolutely nowhere, the cringe-inducing plot advancements, the moronic subplot of Peter learning about his parents' past that does nothing for the story at hand and absolutely head-scratching details like how a high-school student is given access to classified corporate files or knowing how to restart a power plant and turns it all up to 11. Add to that, numerous plot points that are never brought up again, an overstuffed story with too many plot threads, an incompetent script, Sony breathing down Marc Webb's neck at every waking moment and a movie spending more time on starting a shared universe rather than focusing on the story that it should be telling and you're left with one fundamentally flawed film. Sure the film tries to tell its own story, but thanks to Sony micro-managing it to hell and back and a lackluster script curiosity of Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Kevin Pinkner, the story here just feel weighed down by too much focus on making the film something that it shouldn't be.At one point in the play, The History Boys, one of the characters says that history is just one thing after another. One can only envisage that Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and the editors of The Amazing Spiderman 2 might have that saying framed and on their desks, because it would seem that is their method of building a story is just to throw in one thing after another with no rhythm or reason to it. One could make the point that the scenes themselves are decently put together, but the various sub-plots and the various tones never really come together in a harmonious way but rather feel like they're fighting each other for attention and just clash continuously with nothing ever adding up with what the story wants to tell. Ultimately, it's fruitless in the end because when you get down to the core, The Amazing Spiderman 2 isn't really about anything. When it comes to the world of superhero movies, I adore ones that have great characters and that are able to tell a compelling story as well as provide an escape from real life, something that almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have been able to do and this is true with many other superhero films. However, with The Amazing Spiderman 2, that is clearly not the case as the movie is more focused on setting up future films in Sony's shared Spiderman universe, only on occasion delivering on some kind of theme, but never consistently enough that it can fill the bare space at the film's heart. Once again, the beat of the film is so chopped up and broken that maybe there was a more consistent version of the film that was left on the cutting room floor, but I'm quite sure that much like Josh Trank's supposed original of Fant4sic, we'll probably never see that cut of The Amazing Spiderman 2 thanks to incompetent editing and Sony's typical meddling.There's something that can be said for using at least one movie in a franchise to set up your potential shared universe as both the Mummy reboot and Batman V. Superman attempted and failed to do just that and this is an issue that many films like them have suffered from as they try in desperation to ride the coattails of what The Avengers had already done so perfectly, but the clumsy way that Sony tried to achieve the world building in The Amazing Spiderman 2 makes the shared universe building in Iron Man 2 look certainly delicate by comparison. Now, if a movie can create a world from the ground up and make it feel organic and lived-in, then that's perfectly fine. Hell, this is something many big movies have tried to do since the release of Star Wars and for the most part, almost all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films have even been able to pull off the perfect balance between including easter eggs for fans of the comics and also letting the films be their own thing. But in The Amazing Spiderman 2, Sony executives and Avi Arad feel the need to throw everything and the kitchen sink into the movie. Given how the character of Electro feels more like a side note rather than having an actual purpose in the film and Harry Osborne only becomes the Green Goblin towards the end of the film much like Venom did in Spiderman 3, the story in the film like it's trying to fire on all cylinders, rushing towards a third Amazing Spiderman film where Sony, the writers, Avi and even Marc Webb would have said that is where all the cool stuff will happen rather than focusing on what is happening in the movie itself and there's an even bigger problem even if Webb had made a third Amazing Spiderman film. By associating the creation of the villains along with Spiderman to Oscorp and Harry, the possibilities that the shared universe has are made small and trivial. Sony attempting to develop numerous films from the Spiderman cannon already felt like complete insanity and given how underwhelming The Amazing Spiderman 2 was, the further projects that Sony has lined up after Venom doesn't make me feel any more optimistic about what they may unleash upon us particularly now that Spiderman has been yanked out of the MCU.One of the best things that divides the character of Spiderman from many of the other Marvel and DC superheroes is his blue-collar everyman quality. He's not a super-soldier, a billionaire in a high-tech suit of armor or a razor-clawed mutant with a healing factor, he's just an everyday nerdy kid who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time but ueses his powers for good simply because that's the kind of person he is.

Guardians of the Galaxy," Star Wars meets the Avengers.
","Having never even heard of the Guardians of the Galaxy before let alone read any of their comics, I had no idea what I was going to see when I sat down to watch this movie, now I can say that Guardians of the Galaxy is an outstanding comic book movie with its great characters, awesome action scenes, hilarious dialog, kick-ass soundtrack and some potent emotional moments.The film opens with an emotional punch to the gut where a young boy named Peter Quill watches his mother pass away from cancer. Overcome by grief, Quill runs out of the hospital, sobbing when all of a sudden, a group of space pirates appear and abduct Peter. We then cut to 26 years where Quill takes an orb from a planet and is pursued by an outranked agent of the evil Kree warlord Ronan. Upon learning about Quill's theft, Yondu Udonta puts a price on Quill's head while Ronan sends his personal assassin, Gamora to retrieve the orb. Following a scuffle on the planet Xandar with a talking raccoon named Rocket and a walking tree named Groot, the four find themselves in prison where they meet an alien named Drax The Destroyer. Now, the group must learn to stand together and save the universe from Ronan.Unlike other comic book films that approach this kind of situation with a sense of pressure, the characters in Guardians of the Galaxy don't seem to care immediately about the whole saving the world aspect that seems to form the bedrock for other superhero movies, but's that not to say that they don't care about what is happening or what's at risk, it's just the movie focuses more attention on the eccentric atmosphere that it has created and setting up the characters by having them not be heroes at first but common criminals who have lost something or everything only to pull together as a team in the end, not to mention the script by James Gunn and Nicole Perlman is absolutely wonderful and allows each one of the Guardians to have enough time on screen for the audience to get to know them and to sympathize with them as well as incorporating humor into the movie and there were many times throughout the movie were I was wasn't laughing my ass off at some kind of joke or one-liner that a character said with Starlord and Rocket getting the best laughs from me. Also, the comedy is used in reflecting the Earth culture of Starlord which often presents itself in comical fashion where the other characters have no understanding of what it means which makes it even more funny, but even with all the comedy, the movie still does have a fair amount of emotional scenes that keep it grounded with the gut-wrenching opening scene of Peter's mother dying and Groot sacrificing himself are some of the best emotional scenes I've seen in any comic book movie. As for the effects side of things, the movie has some of the best visual effects out of any modern day sci-fi movie, The CGI looks incredibly realistic while the art direction flourishes in every CGI environment created as well as the action which seems be just around the corner throughout the course of the film and it keeps you on the edge of your seat with the final battle on Xandar and the prison escape are the stand-out action sequences in this movie. The music is also fantastic and had songs like 'Hooked on A Feeling' or 'Cherrybomb' not been there then the movie wouldn't have been as good. The songs bring an air of cheerfulness to the movie and thus make it more fun while allowing us a closer look at Peter Quill's character and where he came from. When it comes to the acting, each actor plays their part to perfection. Chris Pratt is awesome as Peter Quill/Starlord, playing the Han Solo of Marvel as well as being an absolute bad-ass at everything he does, but at same time, being a likable character and incredibly hilarious. The scene of Quill dancing to Redbone's 'Come and Get your Love' is one of the best character introductions I've ever seen in any movie. Zoe Saldana as Gamora is one of the best female action heroes in film, she kicks serious ass in the action scenes, is funny when it is called for, and she looks incredibly hot in the film. Dave Bautista is also awesome as Drax the Destroyer with him always taking things too accurate and thus his actions and exchanges with the other Guardians make for some of the most comical moments in the movie, however it's Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as Groot who steal the show in my opinion. Bradley completely nails the voice of this character and Rocket is hysterical, bad-ass, and really carries the emotional scenes well. He's the Marvel version of Ash Williams, but much more sarcastic and funny. Groot may just be the coolest talking tree in all of film and each time he says 'I am Groot', which one might think would get annoying, becomes even funnier every time he says it, but when it comes to the emotional moments, he really shines. I've heard a lot of people didn't like Ronan the Accuser, however I see him as a very menacing villain and Lee Price does a great job playing a tyrannical space dictator. Michael Rooker is awesome as Yondu, Karen Gillian is fantastic as Nebula, Glenn Close and John C. Riley are both great in their roles and Bencio del Toro is wonderful in the role of the Collector.I really don't have any issues with this movie. It's funny, it's engaging, it's emotional, it's got great action, great characters, great effects and a killer soundtrack. Do yourself a favor and go watch Guardians of the Galaxy, it's a total blast.",10,1,4,26 May 2015
The Evil Dead," A landmark for horror movies.
","Now, I'm not the biggest fan of horror movies, so when I sat down to view the first Evil Dead movie, I didn't know if I would even like a film about scary things in the woods, demon possession and a B-list actor, but much like a lot of movies I've watched, Evil Dead totally surprised me with it's use of atmosphere, horror, music and of course Bruce Campbell. After viewing this, it's become one of my favorite horror films period.The film starts with five collage students heading to a remote cabin in rural Tennessee for a vacation. While there, one of the kids hears a feeble satanic voice calling her to join them then her hand becomes controlled and she draws a book with an evil face on it but isn't sure what to do about it, so she doesn't mention it to any of the others. Later on, the door to the cellar strangely opens, compelling two of the kids to venture down and examine it, while down there, they find a Sumerian chronicle of the Egyptian Book of the Dead. While listening to a tape recorder that was found with the book, the voice of the archaeologist a cycle of chants that awaken a strange devilish creature that possesses one of the students. Now it's up to a remaining students to battle the entity while trying to not get possessed themselves and keeping their sanity.Sam Raimi was able to take a budget of 350,000 dollars that would seem small compared to the Hammer horror movies and has given us a truly great horror film that wears it's rating like a token of integrity and shows no mercy or takes no hostages. Evil Dead is still a film that is able to hold it's own despite the film being branded a 'video nasty' over in the UK due to the overabundance of gore and blood, and yet one can't disagree how much influence Evil Dead had on the horror film genre, and while it's not difficult to view things in the movie like trailing shots, the extreme amounts of carnage and the house in the forest location and call it noticeable and quintessential, it's easy to overlook that all of these clichés that have become so associated with horror films over the last few decades arose because of this movie and while that's not to say that the movie isn't silly or over-the-top because it certainly shows that, it's equally amazing when you are aware of the confines the movie was filmed under.Sam's camera work here is nothing short of perfect. By means of rapid camera work and forceful shots, he made a creepy world which is difficult to stare at but too thrilling to not glace at and his way of filming is distinctive which is apparent in the opening scene where the camera produces so much ambiance to make the viewer start nibbling their nails in anxiety of what will happen next. It's one of the best opening shots in film history and dripping with atmosphere. Another incredible shot is when the shadows from the trees begin to pursue the characters and are hitting everything in their path, truly one of the best sequences in any horror movie.Even with it's small price tag, the movie is astonishingly polished on a technological stage, and while the visual effects do come across as outdated and ridiculous, they were made on the cheap when set side by side with modern blockbusters and yet I haven't seen any major Hollywood movie where demons fall apart both externally and internally, bits of body tissue drying up, skulls blowing up, blood spewing everywhere, demons gnawing their hands off and faces rattled with shotgun ammo like darts on a dartboard. The film also works because of it's own self-awareness of that fact that it's a low-budget zombie picture, and yet doesn't take itself very seriously and doesn't think the viewer should either. The film is supposed to be a little on the campy and cheesy side and yet scary and haunting at the same time and there are times in the movie is poking fun at itself and the horror genre too.Of course, a great horror movies are nothing without great characters and the actors who bring them to life and Evil Dead has the best of both. Ellen Sandwess might be dull-looking but she still does well in the part particularly when she gets taken over by a demon. Hal Delrich, Betsy Baker, and Sarah York all play their parts well, but the reason to watch this movie is for Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams. Bruce was born to play this role and he isn't played up as the clichéd Hollywood strong man or the James Bond type hero, but rather playing a regular man who is just as scared as the viewer at what's going on around him. His performance in this movie is what has made him such a hero amongst the cult movie crowd. Bruce portrays the character of Ash with such a comedic brilliance and yet is incredibly benevolent, rather than the toughed bad-ass that we see him become in the second and third movies, while oozing swagger and charisma with unquestionable bravado. His growth as a character is also well done here where Ash starts out as a timid coward and as the film moves along, he becomes a shotgun-holding demon killer by the end. Simply put, Bruce Campbell will always be Ash, no questions asked.Honestly, there really isn't much else I can add to what has already been said about The Evil Dead. It's a timeless horror classic that broke a lot of new ground for the genre which continues to be felt to this day, so if you haven't already seen this, then go out and watch it, you won't regret it!",10,1,3,16 July 2017
Avengers: Age of Ultron," A purely awesome film.
","After seeing the first Avengers and having loved it, I couldn't wait to see Avengers: Age of Ultron and upon seeing the teaser trailer, my expectations for this film shot through the roof and when I sat down to watch the movie in the theater with a few friends, it surpassed most of my expectations while there were a few things that could have been done better.The film opens with The Avengers engaged with Hydra forces lead by Wolfgang von Strucker. While attacking the base, the team encounters two of von Strucker's test subjects, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and arrest von Strucker, while Tony Stark recovers Loki's scepter. Stark and Bruce Banner discover an A.I. within the scepter and use it to finish Tony's world protection plan called 'Ultron'. Unfortunately, once Ultron is created, he comes to believe that the human race must be wiped off the face of the earth in order to save it. He then attacks the Avengers at their base and escapes with the scepter, begins to build an army of drones and recruits the Miximoff twins. Now, it's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before he can fulfill his plan.Joss Whedon had a lot to live up to with this movie and he managed to pack an awful lot into a two and a half hour film and juggles the humor, action and drama very well. Not a single moment in the movie felt wasted and every scene adds to the overall film. The characters also seem much more developed and Joss does a fantastic job digging deeper into each hero's psyche and making each one relatable. Whedon also keeps the tone dark yet the movie does have some light moments and it gave me exactly what I wanted from a superhero movie.Right from the start, the film chucks the team right into some deafening action, pulling us into a whirlwind of dangerous and visually unstoppable action scenes that allow every smash, punch, flash of light and battle to essentially become near-incredible forms of eye-crushing sights and it's when our heroes go into combat that the movie overwhelms our famished eyes and maintains complete control over the viewer's interest, allowing the impressed viewers to follow the visual spectacle as it reaches beyond the audience's mind. I could go on and on about the battle between Iron Man in the Hulk Buster suit and a rampaging Hulk because it's just so damn awesome and the final showdown between The Avengers and Ultron's army almost tops the battle in the first film. The visual effects are great and serve a huge purpose when the action is taking place. The musical score by Danny Elfman and Brian Taylor fits the film perfectly and gives it life.As with the first film, the way the characters interact and play off one another works very well here and not one word of dialog didn't work. The humor couldn't have been better and I found myself laughing my ass off more than once during the course of this movie. The acting is also top-notch with each actor bringing their A game when playing these characters.Robert Downey Jr. never fails to astonish me as Iron Man/Tony Stark in these movies. From his intelligence and skill to his billionaire playboy personality and humor, Downey has perfected the role and made it his own. Chris Evans once again shires as Steve Rogers/Captain America, bringing a real sense of morality and bravery to the role and the argument between Rogers and Stark sows the seeds for Captain America: Civil War. Scarlett Johansson once again is awesome as Black Widow and keeps on proving that women are just as capable of kicking ass as guys are and it was great to see a little of her back-story in the movie. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor, throwing out some really funny lines throughout the movie as well as being a total bad ass in the battle scenes. Mark Ruffalo rocks it again as Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk, juggling the nerdy scientist and the raging green monster extremely well and still manages to be quite humorous at times. One complaint that I had with the first Avengers film was Hawkeye not getting enough time on screen, but thankfully, there's more of him here; Jeremy Renner is terrific in the role, gets a chance to develop the character more and is a total boss in the action scenes. To overlook the new characters in AOU, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision, would be unjust because all three play their roles very well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is good as Quicksilver, capturing the arrogance of the Quicksilver from the comics perfectly, but while I did like Johnson; Evan Peters is and will always be the definitive Quicksilver. Elisabeth Olsen plays the role of Scarlet Witch very well and really comes into her own in the final battle. Paul Bettany is great as Vision. Sam Jackson kills it again as Nick Fury. Anthony Mackie shows up as Falcon and kicks plenty of ass as does Don Cheadle as War Machine. James Spader was born to voice the character of Ultron by being crafty, hilarious, and menacing and portrays both sides of Ultron to perfection.Now, this film isn't entirely perfect, Ultron is extremely underdeveloped and comes across as a whiny villain and not a major threat to the Avengers. The Black Widow-Hulk romance felt out of place and serve no purpose to the overall story and the set-ups for Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok felt shoehorned in and didn't add anything to the movie.Yet, I still enjoyed this movie, it's action-packed, has some strong emotional moments, the score is great, the actors all give top-notch performances, and the post-credits stinger sets up the rest of the MCU nicely. So, do yourself a favor and watch Avengers: Age of Ultron, you'll have a blast watching it.",10,2,7,25 October 2015
2001: A Space Odyssey," The granddaddy of modern science-fiction films.
","When it comes to my experience with Stanly Kubrick's seminal sci-fi game changer, 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's sadly quite limited as I never watched the movie growing up and even if I had, I would have been bored to tears given the movie's glacial pace and it's complex themes about technology so for the longest time, 2001: A Space Odyssey was always a film that passed under my viewing radar until my dad showed it to me and while the visuals impressed me, I was less than impressed by the story. However, late last year, I rewatched it again with my dad and this time, I came to see it for what it is. From its thought-provoking themes and lavish visuals to it's acting and captivating musical score, 2001: A Space Odyssey is a triumph of not only filmmaking but also of visual storytelling. Without it, the world of science-fiction cinema would look very different and we wouldn't have films like Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, or Interstellar.The film opens millions of years ago in Africa as a tribe of human-like apes are chased from their water hole by an enemy tribal. They wake up to see a high black monolith has appeared before them. With the item influencing their actions, the group learns how to use bones as weapons and drive the other tribe away. We then cut to millions of years later where a man named Heywood Floyd is flying to a massive space station above Earth on his way to a US outpost on the Moon. While there, he blocks questions from his friends about claims of a strange item found in a nearby crater. Floyd then travels in a Moonbus to the item. From there, the story keeps jumping ahead in time, showing us various sequences of mankind as he becomes more and more dependent on technology.As an unsurpassed milestone in cinematic history with the likes of Citizen Kane and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, 2001: A Space Odyssey has not only broken the genre traditions of many other sci-fi films, but has also given the world of film a whole new meaning by bypassing spoken delaying, but in no way does that mean that the film breaks all interpretation and debate. From its splendid ideas about the future to its aspiring execution, 2001: A Space Odyssey isn't a film that is focused on entertaining us with epic space battles and witty banter like Star Wars but rather to leave the viewer in wonder and to make them think. It's a movie that stays with you long after the end credits finish rolling, unlike some more recent films. What the viewer must grasp while watching 2001: A Space Odyssey is that it's not the kind of film where one understands what's going on nor does the film require flashy visual effects to keep the viewer's attention but as Kubrick put it, the film is supposed to an extremely individualistic viewing experience that reaches out to the viewer and project an inward feeling of awareness. To put that into terms, the film is more about discovering the more logical and precise areas of humankind while also being a game changer on both a visionary and technological level of filmmaking which makes for one hell of an felt, but to also excel in transporting the viewer to another world entirely through the magic of 2001: A Space Odyssey, that is pure artistic genius in its highest form.Then 2001: A Space Odyssey was first released in 1968, it split moviegoers right down the line much in the same way films like Blade Runner and Star Wars: The Last Jedi would later do. People walking out of the film were common as many were simply baffled by the film's ultimate meaning and it's story and while it's completely clear why many at first hated or were left confused by what 2001: A Space Odyssey was presenting to them, Kubrick always did what he did best by establishing a second thought in the viewer's head as many left the theaters feeling baffled and even a bit downbeat, but the film sowed the seeds in people's minds that eventually grew over the years. In the late 60s when space exploration and alien life were the hot topics of the day, moviegoers whet into 2001: A Space Odyssey wanting answers. Will mankind ever reach the Moon? What does the future hold for us as a species? Are we alone in the universe? To their shock, 2001: A Space Odyssey did the exact opposite by leaving the viewer with even more questions to be answered rather than the other way around.One thing that makes 2001: A Space Odyssey stand out from various other science-fiction films is its surprising lack of dialog. Earlier versions of the film included much more but Kubrick cut a lot of it out of the final cut. What's left over is what Stanly intended to use in telling his story. 2001: A Space Odyssey is a film that goes out of the way to show us things happening on-screen in a visual way. The film lets the viewer figure out the message of the film on their own rather than beating the moral into our heads as well as conveying its topical and rational ideas wholly through the filmmaking elements of picture and sound rather than clunky dialog. I only wish this kind of visual storytelling would be applied to movies like Terminator Genisys. When there is spoken dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's repetitive, uninteresting and all but insignificant to the film's story. During the scene of the shuttle flying to the Clavius base, the dialog is boring small-talk while Heywood Floyd's conversation while flying to the Moon is just as dull and pointless so much so that the musical score completely drowns out the conversation. Without hesitation, the dialog in 2001: A Space Odyssey is the least important thing in the overall story that we are being shown onscreen. This is most clearly seen at the beginning and the end of the film, each of which are spend out over a 20 minute period without any spoken dialog in sight. The movie is flanked by a single-minded disregard for dialog as if Stanly Kubrick is telling us to just watch and not be overloaded with dialog. Both scenes show the most vital story beat in the movie: the strange monolith by some means propels mankind's evolution forward drastically, first from ape to human, then from man to star child. This kind of evolution is visually stripped of spoken words, as Kubrick encourages us in different ways.Unlike some other sci-fi film scores, the music for 2001: A Space Odyssey is all classical, picked especially for the movie and repeated frequently. Kubrick delves into each piece of music to find vivid significance and even learns on these tracks to draw from their cinematic power. The main classical themes for the film are Also Sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss, The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss and a few harmonious tracks from Gyorgy Ligeti. The track Also Sprach Zarathustra has become as synonymous with motivational and phenomenal moments as John Williams' music has become with opening film scores. The section of the score used by Kubrick is the beginning fanfare of the score titled Sunrise. Particularly, Strauss's musical piece hints to Fredrick Nietzsche's abstract essay of the same name that deals with ideas such as mankind's rise to something greater than themselves as well as monumental philosophical questions as well. Both questions are right at home in 2001: A Space Odyssey, where both Hal 9000 and the star child can be seen as a superman as well as the theme of the world riddle type question of life's meaning, the leadership of mankind, and the essence of the universe. Kubrick using this piece of music is the perfect way to convey the messages of 2001: A Space Odyssey without the need to explain it to the viewer. Likewise, Stanly also uses The Blue Danube waltz by Johann Strauss to relay a completely unattached idea but it's much more simple as in space, there's nowhere else to go but in circles. Indeed, space is all about rotating around massive celestial bodies, and 2001: A Space Odyssey shows the viewer this continuously throughout the film. The Blue Danube can be heard in its complete form during the course of the film. the first two-thirds play from the entrance of the weapons satellite to Dr. Floyd arriving at the space station and the last third plays as he approaches the Moon. Using such a lofty piece of music to show outer space travel as being stylish, fantastic and like being in a never-ending dance is a brilliant move by Kubrick as it not only shows us how far technology has come in the past 40 years but also how the regulars onboard the space fight view it with a feeling of indifference much like how we view air travel today. Lastly, there are several musical pieces from Gyorgy Ligeti that also help shape the film and its story. All these musical segments share familiar merits, and appear in 2001: A Space Odyssey as a musical topic to guide the Monolith and Stargate sequences. Displaying thick layers of sound qualities rather than using more classic melodies, these musical moments stand up to traditional meaning and show us the mysterious nature of the Monolith, its power, its beginnings, and the beings who created it. Kubrick uses these musical setpieces in the film because each track commutates an unattached look at the film's various themes without the need for dialog. Zarathustra presents the philosophical questions of the film while The Blue Danube transforms space travel into a graceful dance while Ligeti encourages us to find the actuality of a mysterious force without leaving so much as a hint. Kubrick's usage of music in 2001: A Space Odyssey is nothing short of fantastic as it not only helps tell the story but also provided a foundation for film composers like John Williams and Vangelis to build upon in later years. Simply put, without the music of 2001: A Space Odyssey, sci-fi movie scores would look and sound completely different.Another well-defined aspect of 2001: A Space Odyssey lies in the austerity of its soundtrack. Throughout the film, Stanly Kubrick abandons intricate mixes and discord in favor of the most basic of ideas. When the film starts, it's",10,3,4,22 May 2019
Pulp Fiction," A solid accomplishment of filmmaking.
","For a long time, Pulp Fiction was always a movie that never appealed to me as given it's gore and blatant language, I stayed away from it but after a friend had recommend it to me, I decided to finally watch it and let me tell you, it certainly deserves all the praise it's gotten. From it's graphic violence and slick directing to it's talented cast and kick-ass soundtrack, Pulp Fiction is one of the crown jewels of cinema history.As the movie's story isn't told in chronological order, the three main stories continually interconnect with each other starting with two hit-men named Vincent and Julies appearing at an apartment complex to commandeer a briefcase for their boss Marcellus Wallace and murder a man named Brett and one of his assistants. They then deliver the case to Marcellus only to be kept waiting while Wallace brides a boxer named Butch to be intentionally knocked out during his upcoming match. What follows is a series of events from Vincent taking Marcellus's wife on a date to Marcellus and Butch being held hostage by a pawnshop owner.One of the first scenes of the movie are Vincent and Julies taking about what a Big Mac in France is called, the scene is humorous and has a certain charm to it but it also makes these two hit-men look a bit too ordinary. If the viewer didn't realize, they would think that these two are just talking on their way to work, but what's interesting is that their discussion has no importance to the outcome of the movie and yet without scenes like this, Pulp Fiction would never have been the movie that it is today. One gets the sense that Tarantino threw whatever he wanted into the film and yet in some way, the finished movie isn't just consistent but amazingly rough around the edges.As the movie doesn't follow a single narrative, some people will have problems keeping up with the story and who's backstabbing who, but the movie works a lot better if you pay close attention to what is happening and see it as a dark comedy disguised as a crime drama. Each of the stories in the movie start with a circumstance that could have been developed for any run-of the-mill crime movie, but something always manages to go awry, some tiny sudden calamity which effects the entire case and causes it to crumble, driving the frenzied characters to bizarre methods. Tarantino's creativeness comes from a capability to focus on insignificant details and accompany them wherever they might go, even if they divert the story away from predictable story changes.It's no surprise that fans of the movie have spent arguing about what's in the suitcase, which leads to them delving deeper into the film more than Tarantino anticipated. The movie is so wonderfully arranged with a lot of amazing details, many of them you won't even see on your first viewing so the film seems to be bawling for deep analysis, but there isn't anything to really analyze, as the name of the film implies, it's an accomplishment in craft and method and a distinguished and arranged one at that. Perhaps no other movie script will ever find a superior role for detours as the entire movie seems to involve them at every turn. No character speaks a line of dialog in a sincere way as Julies does in one of the final scenes of the movie where he could just tell the couple robbing a restaurant that they should just stay clam and no one will be injured which would be a typical line of dialog from your standard action or crime movie, but rather than do that, Jules goes out on a limb about what Fonzie is then asks the robber to get his wallet. Tarantino relishes every phrase uttered by his characters, discovering a promising joke in every conversation and fortifying it with crafty mainstream culture mentions, but the dialog isn't just funny; it's packed with insightful reflections on human conduct or people's religious views. Mia Wallace's comment to Vincent about reveling in the silence or Julies reciting Ezekiel 25.17 are the best examples of this and out of all the scripts to come out of Hollywood, Pulp Fiction is truly one of the best.The film is also shot wonderfully with no shortage of bright colors, amazing camcorder shots and fantastic camera angles, the soundtrack is also amazing with a great mix of classic songs ranging from Dusty Springfield's 'Son of a Preacher Man' and Al Green's 'Let's Stay Together' to Neil Diamond's 'Girl, You'll be a Woman Soon' which help to make it a truly unique movie but also makes it more fun to watch.for a film of this magnitude to work, the cast had to be perfect for the roles and they certainly deliver on that. Uma Thurman is wonderful as Mia Wallace nailing the sharp dialog with ease, Bruce Willis provides a dynamic performance as the boxer Butch as does Maria De Mederios as Butch's girlfriend. Ving Rhams plays mob boss Marcellus Wallace in true style. Eric Scholtz is great as the drug dealer Lance, Christopher Waken pops up in a flash from the past scene and gives a fine performance even if his time on screen isn't very much and even director Quentin Tarantino shows up in a short cameo. John Travolta's performance as Vincent Vega is truly a sight to see as he puts a new coat of paint on the role of the hit-man and makes it his own with just the right amount of elegance and charm, while Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Jules with his undercurrent of evilness, showing an attitude of vicious anger and is still to maintain his cool even when facing death.There isn't much else I can say about Pulp Faction except to go watch it if you haven't already.",10,0,1,2 October 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Hooked on a feelin'
","Following my viewing of the first Guardians of the Galaxy film back in early 2015, I eagerly awaited the return of the galaxy's coolest band of misfits so once I heard that James Gunn was going to be bringing us a sequel to the 2014 space fantasy, I got pretty gritty as I adored the first film and once the first trailer dropped, I was over the moon. I couldn't wait to see it so in May of 2017, I went to my local movie theater with a friend and after 2 hours, I came out of the movie overjoyed and even a bit sad at what I had seen. From it's themes and action to its fantastic soundtrack and performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not only a non-stop cosmic thrill ride but also one of the most personal films in the MCU that I've seen yet.The film begins on Earth in the year 1980 where a young woman named Meredith Quill driving with her boyfriend. He then takes her to a place in the woods where he shows her an alien seedling he planted. We then jump forward 38 years later to The Guardians of the Galaxy protecting a batch of precious batteries for an alien race called The Sovereign in return for Gamora's sister Nebula but after Rocket Raccoon steals some of the batteries, The Sovereign attack the Guardians with a fleet of drones but are destroyed by an unknown force and the team crash-lands on a planet where the mysterious force reviles itself to be Peter Quill's father, Ego the Living Planet. The Guardians then travel with Ego and his assistant Mantis to his home planet while The Sovereign hires Yondu Udanta to track down The Guardians. Now, Peter Quill must choose between his real father and unleash his true power or remain with the team all while other forces conspire to bring down them down.Part of what made the first Guardians of the Galaxy film work so well was its regression from what a typical sci-fi film is usually seen as. Director James Gunn and writer Nicole Perlman gave us a masterfully crafted homage to 80s nostalgia by rooting it in a lead hero in form of Peter Quill who found himself taken away from everything he ever knew on Earth after watching his mother die. Some superhero movies work wonders when they are homages or as a tool to deliver a more human experience to the viewer such as Spiderman 2 or Iron Man 3. Guardians of the Galaxy is the story of a young boy who is taken from a life on Earth to being a tool for a band of pirates and though that, the character of Star-Lord is forged and in the first film, he starts out as a thief only out for monetary gain but upon meeting Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket, he learns what it means to be a team leader and in this movie, Peter learns what it means to be apart of a family and what family truly means.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 works not only as a sequel to the first movie but also as a further exploration of the cosmic side of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If the first Guardians of the Galaxy explored Peter dealing with the death of his mother, this film deals with his relationship with his distant father. As with the first film, this one is slathered from top to bottom with 80s nostalgic callbacks as there's even a point in the film where Quill and Gamora mention David Hasselhoff. It's impossible to tell wither Star-Lord is dealing with Ego or someone else entirely. In terms of story, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as direct as a superhero movie can be with various character and thematic arches but the film remains focused on its core story relating to the relationship between Peter, Ego, and Yondu and while the film may not be delicate about its message, at the very least, it isn't beating you over the head every 5 minutes with its moral unlike Avatar did with its moral and while this formula has been explored numerous times in other movies from Mary Poppins and Terminator 2 to Hook and The Incredibles, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is notable for how it approaches this subject. The themes of family and fatherhood dominate the film and dive its story. For example, the film compares the themes of family and desire by asking us what makes a family and what price must be paid for the sake of family unity. It's about maintaining a balance between work and family and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 even makes a subtle conclusion that when we are pursuing monetary gain, we are also pursuing family as well.Throughout the course of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, each character goes through their own family conflicts thus allowing them to grow as characters. Peter Quill's ach in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is him coming to terms with his actual father and the Guardians themselves. At the start of the film, Peter is asked by the Sovereign what his heritage is, we see him being uncertain as he never knew his father which is a contrast to The Sovereign who have hereditarily engineered their children to be flawless in every single way. Though this scene, the viewer can see how Star-Lord is different as he never knew the love of a father and this makes him unsure of who he really is and where he fits in. The scene is also a fine example of how to state the theme of your movie but without beating it into the viewer's brain. As for Gamora, her sister is literality her enemy and she claims that she doesn't care about Nebula or Peter Quill when in reality she does. Given how Gamora's on father is a murderous super villain, she's happy with things the way they are as opposed to Peter who is looking to make a family with her as she doesn't want to get hurt or feeling vulnerable. That's how Gamora gets by in these movies. As a matter of fact, she sees the Guardians as her new family and wants it to stay that way hence why she's angry when Ego first shows up in Peter's life. Again, this is spoken when she says to Quill that he already has a family. Gamora's echoing is exceptionally upsetting as she comes from a broken family herself given how Thanos killed her family and took her in as his own and she doesn't understand how to connect with anyone else because of what Thanos did to her and Nebula. Her whole character arc is about keeping her new adopted family in the form of the Guardians of the Galaxy together while also opening up to Peter Quill's advances and making her own family with him as well as facing her own kin in the form of Nebula. As for Rocket Raccoon, his arc in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is that much like the first film, he acts like nobody cares about him and keep pushing the other Guardians away at every opportunity because he's horrified of being apart of a family and given his origin of being a genetically altered raccoon still haunts him so he's made it his goal to prove that he is the best out of the team. This is the first taste the viewer gets of the theme of desire over family as Rocket tries to one-up everyone else on the team but in doing so, he further damages his relationship with the other Guardians. He also uses zeal erratically such as stealing the batteries from The Sovereign just to spite the rest of the Guardians and to fend off any notion of family as that worries him.Nebula says that she's out to kill Gamora as well as Thanos for the pain he put her through by making Nebula fight Gamora and replacing parts of Nebula's body with parts of machinery whenever Gamora beat her in battle, but Nebula can't kill Thanos so killing Gamora will do nicely. She feels second-rate, so she's out to show that she is better than Gamora in every possible way, but this has nothing to do with ambition but rather revenge. It's primeval and shows Nebula's desperate need for a family even more so than Rocket's need for the same thing. As for Yondu Udanta, Peter Quill's adopted father, his fantastic character introduction of him visiting a robotic call girl and all the while the experience leaves him feeling empty and then having a confrontation with his Ravager clan who declare that Yondu broke the code by keeping Peter Quill alive and child trafficking. Much like the other characters in the film, Yondu has his own issues with his Ravager family as they have a moral code and due to Udanta breaking it, they shun him. It's a wonderful depiction of a character torn between two awful choices, losing Peter or losing his clan. It's a fine example of how we all have different groups of family and sometimes we are forced to choose between one or the other and for Yondu, he doesn't have a choice here as he doesn't have a family to speak of and he saw a chance to have a family with Quill and he chooses that over his clan and while Yondu may say to the Ravagers that he doesn't care what they say, it still hunts him nonetheless. So when The Sovereign hire him to capture the Guardians of the Galaxy, he agrees and goes after his adopted son. As for Drax, he may have the least developed family arc in the film but he still acts improperly with everyone else in the movie which the other characters just accept it. He's not trying to drive the rest of the Guardians away unlike Rocket is but receives them. As clumsy and inept as he is, Drax is absolute that a family is a unit. His desire for a more personal family isn't really shown to us as Drax is straightforward about everything but he does remain hidden when it comes to his emotions which do come out later on in the film. With Baby Groot, he's everyone's kid. No matter what the Guardians are doing, wither fighting some high monster or repairing their ship, he is always there with one of the team looking after him and protecting him. He's the genuine glue that keeps the Guardians of the Galaxy together and he is what makes them a family. While Baby Groot may only have a small character arc in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, he nonetheless is the emotional heart of the story and the team. He is what makes the Guardians of the Galaxy the team that it is so he does give them a reason to work together, accept each other and get along with one another all for the sake of Baby Groot.

Thor," All hail the God of Thunder.
","Having never read a single Thor comic when I was younger, I didn't know what to think of Thor when I sat down to watch it. Well, I will say that Thor is a great movie from its impressive visual design to its acting and even has a little Shakespearean drama thrown in for good mention. Our story starts off well, first with Natalie Portman clobbering Thor with her car then the film cuts to 965 A.D. where the Asgardian king Odin does battle with the Frost Giants and their king, Laufey, defeats them and seizes the Casket of Ancient Winters. In the present day, Odin's son Thor is about to become king when the ceremony is rudely interrupted by the Frost Giants trying to recover the Casket. Against his father's orders, Thor, Loki and a few friends journey to Jotuhnheim to challenge Laufey. A fight breaks out between the Asgardians and the Frost Giants resulting in Odin having to saving their hides. For his son's overconfidence, Odin strips Thor of his powers and exiles him to Earth when Thor meets Dr. Jane Foster, Darcy Lewis and Dr. Erik Selvig. Meanwhile, Loki seizes the throne, while Thor learns to become more human and begins to develop a romantic attraction to Jane, but Thor must prove himself worthy in order to return home and stop Loki's devious plans. Like other Marvel films before it, Thor show that in the right hands, a comic book film that may seem stupid can have secret complexities when it's put in the right directorial hands. Any discord I would have had with Kenneth Branagh being the director seemed to vanish in the first 30 minutes of the movie. This is a brave and dicey move for a director who is known for showing the theatrics and details of Shakespearean dialog to the silver screen to tackle a superhero film meant for general movie goers. Adding to the film are the Shakespearean undercurrents of disloyalty and sacrifice, not to mention Branagh bringing a bit of realistic feeling to the magical setting. It's also fair to say that Branagh understands the character of Thor and while his version of Thor differs from the comics, he still gets the main points down pretty well, much like how Christopher Nolan handled Batman. When it comes to the humor, it doesn't feel overdone and provides us with a great change between what is going on in Asgard and Earth. Out of all the MCU films I've seen thus far, Thor got to be one of the most visually stunning, the effects and production design is eye-popping; Asgard just might be one of the most astonishing landscapes I've ever seen. I had to strain my eyes, attempting to take in all the elements in, but visuals can't sell a big summer movie without action and the movie gives us some great fight sequences. The battle on Jotuhnheim is fantastic, with Thor and his buddies showing off some awesome moves, the fight at the S.H.I.E.L.D. compound is realistic and thrilling, while the showdown between Thor and the Destroyer is another mind-blowing action scene. The musical score is also great with Patrick Doyle providing us with some unforgettable tunes that enhance our viewing of the movie.The sibling conflict here is handled perfectly and is a powerful driving force during the film and is fully understood by the actors. Thor does show love for Loki, but there is an absence of understanding along with jealousy and loathing. Loki is far from being a one-dimensional cartoony villain but instead being a more likable villain who admires his father but also hates him. As for the cast, they're all perfect. Chris Hemsworth exemplifies the personality of Thor perfectly, projecting Thor's journey from an egoistical warrior to a more humble, understanding person with ease along with humor, fighting, and love all being embraced in his performance flawlessly. Natalie Portman is enchanting and magnetic as Jane Foster; the scenes of her and Hemsworth together just seep chemistry while her scenes with Stellan Skarsgard and Kat Dennings excel with a great sense of friendship. Tom Hiddleson steals the film whenever he is on screen as the sliding, scheming yet strangely sensitive Loki; this is a perfectly dense part, and Tom never misses a beat while playing the character. Anthony Hopkins, rather than hamming it up, bring a great seriousness to the role of Odin by being threatening, yet wise and tried from his years of knowledge and learning, The sequences between him, Hemsworth and Hiddleson are wonderful, with each actor bringing all their talent to the table and accomplishing it beyond anyone's hopes. Jamie Alexander, Ray Stevenson, Tadanobu Asano and Josh Dallas are all good in their respective roles. Renee Russo gets a few brief appearances here and there as Frigga. Idris Elba is awesome as Heimdal and is a force to be reckoned with. Clark Gregg shows up as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson and has a bigger role to play here. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Dr. Selvig. Even Samuel Jackson and Jeremey Renner show up briefly, teasing future MCU films. The only actor that I disliked was Kat Dennings as Darcy as she came across as annoying and pointless to the overall plot of the movie. Now, I do have some problems with this film: the romance between Thor and Jane feels a little rushed into the story at break-nick speed and is given no room to develop into a much deeper love story. My other issue is how when Thor comes to Earth, he changes from being an egocentric warrior to being a more compassionate person within a matter of days, something I think could have been explored much more deeply. Outside of those problems, I really enjoyed Thor and you're a fan of comic book films, Give this film a watch, it'll knock your socks off.",10,2,4,6 March 2015
The Departed," One of the best crime dramas in the history of film.
","When The Departed hit theaters in 06', I passed on seeing it, because I wasn't into serious dramatic films. Well, times have changed as The Departed has got to be one of the finest crime dramas in the history of film. From its directing and soundtrack to its acting, this is filmmaking at its best. The film begins with Francis 'Frank' Costello introducing young Colin Sullivan to the world of structured crime in Boston. Over the years, Costello coaches Sullivan to be a mole within the Massachusetts State Police, until Colin is allowed into the Special Investigations Unit. Meanwhile, Billy Costigan is hired by Captain Queenan and Sergeant Dignam to go undercover and infiltrate the mod as his family connections make him an ideal choice. He leaves the academy and spends time in jail to increase his trustworthiness. Both Sullivan and Costigan settle into their particular organization, and Colin starts a romance with a police psychiatrist which Costigan is also having a relationship with her. Soon both of them find who the other one is and are told by their respected group to find the 'rat' in their ranks. What follows is a bunch of double-crossings, murders, lies, and backstabbing. While this film is a remake of the Hong Kong film, Internal Affairs, moving the location to Boston allows director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter William Monahan to guarantee that The Departed isn't a rehash of its Chinese predecessor by making the film longer and introducing a few new characters and subplots, but the most critical difference is the portrayal of the crime underworld: whereas Internal Affairs is polished without being extreme, while Scorsese's film includes very colorful language, typical in all his films, and lots of blood, plus the finale of the movie proves to be extremely appalling, but none of the scenes ever extend into the overly sickening levels of Casino's head in a trap scene, but in classic Scorsese fashion, the film remains bluntly gory. It's always a treat to watch a movie where Scorsese projects and analyzes a crime drama with such splendid skillfulness and commitment. For example, the well-written and fantastically shot scene where Costello lures Colin into the world of crime by giving him comic books and groceries is a straightforward portrayal of how the innocent become the naÃ¯ve and Scorsese works miracles by giving the scene a little tangy twist by adding in a little dark humor. It's significant how a Hong Kong crime film could be carried over into an American setting with such clever care and William Monahan writes so perfectly, giving each character enough time to develop on screen until you come to care about that character. The story loosens with an honest indifference to anything that is unimportant to the overall story, and Editor Thelma Schoonmaker edits and trims the movie outstandingly to keep it full of tension. The movie constantly throws pot twist after plot twist at the viewer to the point where the person watching the movie is unable to keep up with who is back-stabbing or lying to who, but it's all done so effortlessly that one just goes along with it. As with all of Scorsese's films, the acting is just perfect. Mark Walberg is fantastic as Sergeant Dignam, stealing every scene he's in with his foul mouth, bad cop attitude and Bostonian accent. Alec Baldwin is perfect as the wise-cracking, crude, yet effective role as the police chef. Martin Sheen is also great as Captain Queenan, providing much of the fatherly wisdom throughout the course of this film. Vera Farmiga is great as Mdolyn Madden, providing the love interest for both our lead characters, but actually adds something to the story. Jack Nicholson is on top form in this film as Frank Costello, walking the line between normality, parenthood, family and psychopathic killer with ease. Whenever Nicholson is on screen, it's impossible for you to relax. He builds tension in every scene he's in with each look and motion, acting likes a pit viper ready to strike. Leonardo DiCaprio excels here as Billy Costigan and is simply mesmerizing whenever he is on screen, causing you to care about him, allowing us to sympathize with him due to the psychological and bodily pain he must endure and shows us how it would feel to be wedged into a network of unfamiliar but relentless danger, while at the same time, he's attempting to find his way with whatever clues he is able to find. DiCaprio may have been loathed for his pretty boy looks, but he has become an accomplished and adaptable actor and The Departed allows him to showcase more of his acting greatness. Matt Damon also delivers a brilliant performance as Colin Sullivan, having great assurance in himself as well as Scorsese putting Matt's traits into a character that isn't compassionate in the slightest, something Damon did in Syriana, but takes it to a greater level in this film. We don't really feel for Damon, and you desire to see him get captured, yet at the same time he's not a typical cardboard villain, and Matt does an incredible job showing us a man who has lost his ethical compass, but is still tore about his twin personalities regardless, and isn't content about the brewing conflict. He is an obsessive liar, but is openly hurt when his untruthfulness affects his relationship with his girlfriend. I can honestly say that The Departed is a perfect film in every level, and while some viewers may find the plot confusing and the whole who is back-stabbing who hard to follow, this film is still worth watching. It's well paced, has great suspense, brilliant acting, tight editing, a killer soundtrack and is shot wonderfully. So do yourself a favor and go watch this film, it's the true definition of a masterpiece.",10,0,2,20 June 2016
The Wolf of Wall Street," Excess to the extreme.
","My first exposure to The Wolf of Wall Street came when I saw a trailer for the film attached to World War Z and while I certainly thought the movie looked interesting, I wasn't sold on it due to the content I was seeing so I avoided the movie when it first came out and didn't watch it until earlier this year and while I was taken aback by the sheer amount of explicit content in a few scenes, I absolutely loved the movie. From it's solid directing and fast-paced humor to its incredible acting and story, The Wolf of Wall Street is another cinematic home run for Martin Scorsese.The film starts in 1987 where a young man named Jordan Belfort gets a job working as a stockbroker for a stock company called L.F. Rothschild where he is hired to work under Mark Hanna who introduces Jordan to the drug and sex-fueled broker culture and plants the idea in Jordan's head that making money for one's self is a stockbroker's ultimate goal and that enough is never enough. With these words in mind, Belfort goes to work but following Black Monday, his career is terminated and gets a job at a small brokerage firm company. Thanks to his combative pitching style, Jordan begins to profit but soon forms his own investment broker company with a few friends called Stratton Oakmont. After posting an ad, hundreds of young brokers come flocking to Belfort's company. As a result of the business profiting, Jordan and his entourage profit handsomely from it and soon descend into a life of drugs and women with Jordan even cheating on his own wife. Meanwhile, the FBI and the SEC begin investigating Belfort's firm and start to clamp down on the corporation which leads Jordan to try and find a way to keep his firm and his money from collapsing while also dealing with his own personal issues.Given the unsubtle condemnation of the Wall Street stockbroker approach and lifestyle in Oliver Stone's 1987 movie, Wall Street, it would seem to clarify the basis of The Wolf of Wall Street, a movie that makes all of Oliver Stone's most barbarous neutering of the overindulgence on the stock exchange look like a walk in the park by comparison. Truly, the movie all but instantly endorses this in an early scene where an editorial is advertising a colossal uptick in job applications at Jordan's firm. So, with the need for the movie to go much more larger and colossal in terms of showing the decline of a character like Belfort, the movie shows him literally snorting cocaine out the body of a women and yet by some means continues to go downhill further and further until he is waist-deep in self-indulgence and extravagance. Despite the movie feeling endlessly long and overly bouncy sometimes, it's also a film that is grueling as well as intoxicating to watch and while it may feel less like an organized story and more like an almost three-hour decadence agenda, it still nonetheless carries it's own cinematic weight and gives the viewer a masterpiece of storytelling and character drama not seen since The Godfather. Martin Scorsese is easily one of the greatest directors still working today and The Wolf of Wall Street just keeps on showing us why he is such an incredible director and storyteller with an almost absurd amount of excitement and passion for the art of filmmaking. In a lot of ways, The Wolf of Wall Street feels like something of a follow-up to two of his most beloved and acclaimed movies, Casino and Goodfellas even though the movie takes place in its own universe and Jordan Belfort is a professional convict who does more harm with a pen than a gun in the film. Despite that, all three movies survive as Martin's own disembowelment of the cynicism of the American Dream and much like Goodfellas, The Wolf of Wall Street grants the viewer entry into a symbolically glittering world. Much like the casinos of Las Vegas in Casino or the Irish Mob of Boston in The Departed, Wall Street is depicted as a bona fide playground for those people with no moral high ground. Sex, drugs, and money are all here and are frequently shown on screen, sometimes even in the same scene which can be a bit unsettling for some viewers but is necessary to progress the story and the characters. Much like several of his other movies, Scorsese feels less concerned with the methods Belfort makes his money and more with how money and power can corrupt a person no matter their social background. Early on in the film, some of the characters are having a conversation about tossing short people at targets for their own delight and going through what can or can't be done in terms of entertainment. Selfishness and fraud are depicted here as wide-ranging and irresistible as Jordan's decadence is nothing short of outlandish but it also encompasses every single last inch of his company so much so that there have to be sighs in the bathrooms outlawing lovemaking and even Belfort's butler gets dragged into the cycle of sex, drugs and cash driving home the point that even the most cultured people can become contaminated by power and greed. Of course, the movie is quite honest about it's leading character, Jordan Belfort who may seem like your typical lawbreaker and scam artist but is also an erratic storyteller. The film engages interest to this continuously, most noticeably in the contrast between his interpretation of a drug-hazed drive home and what actually happened along with the ramifications of that drive. In lieu of presenting an accurate and fair depiction of Jordan's behavior, the movie cleverly allows him to give his own account of what is happening onscreen. As such, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Belfort small apologetic moments sprinkled within his flashes of harshness, antipathy, sexism, anger, and cold-bloodiness. Easily one of the best film characters ever to grace the silver screen. While The Wolf of Wall Street may feel like a heavenly accomplice to some of Scorsese's earlier movies, it's obvious with this movie and later with Silence that Martin has matured greatly as a filmmaker and a storyteller. This movie, however, feels more like a bigger step for Scorsese and company as well as a much more adventurous and unproven with Scorsese continuously pulling the viewer's leg with how phony the movie really is. Masterfully aided by Terrence Winters' wonderful screenplay, Martin crafts a hazy impression of hyper-reality around the movie's events, making it feel like something in a drug-fueled fog. Of course, Scorsese constantly pulls the viewer's attention to the fact that the movie they're watching is, in fact, a movie as the aspect ratio always seems to continuously alter as the film progresses as even the boundaries of the screen change from scene to scene which fits with the story that the film is trying to show us. Marketing also plays a high part in The Wolf of Wall Street such as when Belfort fills the viewer on the facts surrounding a crazy money laundering scam or when the FBI arrest Jordan while he's filming a commercial but the agents don't stop with just apprehending Belfort as they also process to directly interrupt the entire shot-on-camera scene making for easily one of finest apprehension scenes in film history. It's also one of the boldest and divisive storytelling ideas in the movie. Also effective in the story that The Wolf of Wall Street is telling is how Scorsese grants Dicaprio free rein over the movie's plot. At one point, Belfort's voice-over straightens out the movie over the color of his car, giving the viewer an awareness of Jordan's preferences in telling his own story through the narration rather than just explaining what is happening to us as the movie certain enough to let Belfort to show us his story unfolding on the screen rather than just dumping explanation dialog on us like some other movies have a tendency to do. At its heart, The Wolf of Wall Street is in essence penned as a cavalier endeavor at self-defense by a calculating maniac as he goes through various stages of decadence and self-indulgence as well as having to deal with the government breathing down his neck at every turn. Unlike directors like Paul Feig or Michael Bay who often insult the viewer's intelligence, Martin Scorsese trusts us enough to allow us to use our brains in order to realize that Jordan can't be trusted which might seem like a massive jump for a movie director of Scorsese's caliber but taking into account the movie has generated debates about how it portrays Belfort much like how Pulp Faction has kindled similar disputes, it would seem that Martin has misjudged filmgoers and, yet the movie never once makes any sort of sympathy pea for Jordan or even paste a convenient moralistic accusation over the end credits as it simply isn't essential for what the film is showing us. Any person watching the movie who can't even use their brain to figure out how disgraceful Jordan is, regardless of his efforts to justify his behavior, would have to be very improbable to be convinced by a corny afterthought or a condescending honest condemnation. The film is continuously harsh in its judgment of Jordan, so much so that the FBI agent that is questioning him seems to find Belfort notably repulsive due to there being no justification for his extreme excess as Jordan wasn't born into this lifestyle but rather chose to live it which in turn makes the story all the more complex and compelling. Given how the film is adapted from the book by the same name, The Wolf of Wall Street gives Jordan the freedom to create his own protection. During a pep talk scene, Belfort discusses to his employees how he gave a struggling single mother money to help her family and while the movie counts on the viewer to consider that this is a self-directed act of generosity as a counteract against his sexist demeanor over the course of the film. Jordan's firmness that he will do anything to ensure his families' safety is counterbalanced by disregard and irresponsibility and his esteem for allegiance is",10,3,6,8 October 2018
Army of Darkness," Hail to Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi, baby.
","Following my viewing of Evil Dead II, I was so pumped to watch the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise and sure enough, it didn't let me down. From start to it's ending, Army of Darkness is a non-stop fun ride, packed with great humor, a haunting score, solid directing and Bruce Campbell.Picking up where the end of the second movie left off, Ash Williams is sucked though a portal and finds himself in medieval England where he is enslaved by a local lord and is led to a castle where he is tossed into a pit and kills a Deadite and begins to form a relationship with one of maidens at the castle, but still wants to return to his own time. With the assistance of the castle's wise man, Ash learns that only the Book of the Dead has the power to spend him back, so Ash gallops off to retrieve the book, only to unleash the evil upon the people when he doesn't utter the correct worlds. Now, Ash and the remaining castle defenders must stop the Evil Dead before it destroys them.When the first Evil Dead movie came out in 1981, it changed the horror genre forever and six years later, Sam gave us a sequel that was even better than the first one, now with Army of Darkness, Raimi has given us the ultimate cult horror movie and while some trilogies fail with producing a great third movie, such is not the case here as Army of Darkness is able to be a fine sequel without having to throw the quality of the first two movies out the window.As with the first two, the budget is quite small at around 11 million and yet the movie still is able to build a frightening and exciting fantasy domain with impressive sets like the castle, an old windmill and a graveyard which do look fantastic as do the visual effects, showing the same level of effort and passion Sam and the crew put into the other movies and they still hold up wonderfully to this day with a mix of prosthetics, make-up, masks, and blue-screen which help make the world come alive as does the make-up on Evil Ash which is also impressively done, but when it comes to the effects in the film, nothing beats the stop-motion skeleton army which seem to have been lifted straight out of a Ray Harryhausen movie. With the budget being 10 million easily being viewed on the screen, Sam and the crew clearly had to be more imaginative and the results look incredibly real and intimidating and are able to produce a creepy and valid ambiance that is rarely seen in today's horror films.The directing here in again top-notch. Sam Raimi continues to use his trademark peppy and unconventional style when filming Army of Darkness and it works a treat. One of the reasons I admire his films so much is because of Sam's unbridled ability and readiness to put the viewer's amusement center stage, not to mention his camera work here is nothing short of perfection here, making great use of fast-moving cuts and shots, while the score by Joseph Loduca and Danny Elfman is creepy and unsettling and compliments the movie nicely and Bill Pope's cinematography is simply beautiful to behold.While Evil Dead 2 managed to balance the horror and comedy beautifully, Army of Darkness does add a lot more humor to the mix and while that will turn some people away from it, I feel that it works in the movie's favor. The scene of Ash forgetting which words he needs to recite when retrieving the Necromoicon and alternately hiccups on the last word and the outcome is him being eye-poked by a bunch of skeletons is truly hilarious or when he attempts to take a false version of the Book of the Dead only to be almost engulfed by a vortex or when Evil Ash has a shotgun pointed up his nose but the scene that had me laughing my head off the most during the course of the movie is where after the evil has chased Ash into an abandoned windmill then is attacked by numerous tiny villainous clones of himself that come out of a shattered mirror and they proceed to attack him by ramming a fork into his back and one jumps down his throat, truly one of the best scenes in the whole trilogy that'll have you in stitches the whole time.As with Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, all the cast in Army of Darkness play their parts well. Marcus Gilbert is incredibly straight laced as Lord Arthur, providing a candid contrast to Ash's tomfoolery while Ian Abercrombie brings a certain charm to the role of Arthur's wise man as does Embeth Davidtz as Shelia, the women who catches Ash's eye. Richard Grove rounds out the cast perfectly as Lord Henry and even Bridget Fonda and Sam's brother Ted Raimi have some memorable moments, but as with the last two films, Bruce Campbell is the reason to watch this movie. I can't say it enough how Bruce is and will always be Ash Williams, no questions asked. From starting out as a frightened pansy in the first film to being a demon slaying bad-ass, his character has matured as the movies were made and here, he is in his element as your ordinary American Joe with his shotgun, cocky attitude and one-liners, but still manages to maintain the same level of swagger and charisma that he had in the first two movies as well as continuing to give us tons of awesome physical comedy as well as showing us insensitive weakness, over-the-top scene chewing, and irregular bravery.Go watch Army of Darkness if you haven't seen it already, I can't recommend it enough.",10,1,1,14 August 2017
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The home stretch.
","After watching Attack on the Clones, I was even more excited about the prospect of a third Star Wars movie coming out so when I went to see The Incredibles in November of 2004, I saw a short teaser for the final chapter of George Lucas's prequel trilogy, Star Wars: Episode 3, Revenge of The Sith. After seeing the trailer, I was over the moon, I was so pumped to see this movie and it was all I could think about for the next few months so once May 2005 came, my dad and I went to see the film and after 2 hours, I walked out of my local movie theater in awe of what I had just watched. Once the film came out on DVD later that year, my brother and I got the movie for Christmas and over the next few years, we watched it quite a few times. However, as I grew older and began to see the prequels in a different light, I came to see Revenge of The Sith as the only great film out of the entire prequel trilogy but in preparation for seeing Episode 9 later this year, I decided to rewatch it and lo and behold, I actually still think that despite a quite a few glaring problems, Revenge of The Sith is the best film in the entire Star Wars prequel trilogy due to it's actual effort to tell a great story rather than just be a bore fest like Attack of The Clones and Phantom Menace.The film opens with Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker leading a rescue mission to save Chancellor Palpatine from the cyborg General Grievous while a massive space battle erupts over Coruscant. Upon landing on Grievous' ship, the two Jedi locate Palpatine and duel Count Dooku whom Anakin kills The three then attempt to escape but are again captured by General Grievous but due to a diversion by R2-D2, Obi-Wan and Anakin are able to corner him but before they can attack him, Grievous makes his get-away. Anakin is able to land the war-wrecked ship on Coruscant. Anakin then reunites with his wife, Padme Amidala who then tells her husband that she's pregnant. While happy at first, Anakin then begins to have nightmares of Padme dying in childbirth. Upon discussing the issue of his wife's death with Yoda, Anakin is then summoned to Palpatine's office where the chancellor appoints Anakin to the Jedi Council as his personal representative but the Council refuse to make him a master and give Anakin a mission to spy on Palpatine, causing him to lose his faith in the Jedi Order. While visiting Palpatine at the opera house, the chancellor tempts Anakin with a story about a Sith Lord who could save people from death. Now, Anakin is torn between learning this new knowledge in order to save his wife or remain with the Jedi all while Palpatine continually twists Anakin's mind and feeds his fear.The day of May 19th, 2005 was not a simple day for Star Wars fans as it was a day where all the pieces of the previous films would fall into place, thus closing the book on more than 28 years of movie history and lore. Fans of the series had wondered and debated about it, there had been books and stories written about it along with facts gathered and everything else for the sake of one film series that will always remain in the hearts of its fans. It's something that Star Wars has always had from its beginnings in 1977 to where it is today and regardless of how some fans may feel about the series, the saga will continue to live on in one form or another. Possibly, every person who left their local movie theater could never show or even speak about what they saw over those two hours. Happiness, anguish, teary-eyed, pure shock, mournfully leaving the theater, getting back in line to see the movie again. All these are natural when watching a film on the big screen but for some, watching Revenge of The Sith was an experience much like seeing The Force Awakens would be 10 years later.Given how mediocre the last two prequel films had been and how this was the last move in the Star Wars saga at the time, it's not shocking that some people consider Revenge of The Sith to be the definitive chapter of the saga that Lucas created and while I consider Empire Strikes Back to be the definitive film in the series, Episode III is easily the most extreme and heavy of the prequels. It pierces every organ in the body, not permitting any air to enter the lungs, and touches hearts and souls alike. As the viewer can only watch the film play out on the screen, we are the onlookers but we can also sympathize with what the characters are going through and at some point during the movie, there's only a doom sigh as the film tells us that there is no way out. Of course, given that this is the third film in the series, it's a lot more painful and tragic than most of the other Star Wars films. Here, the Republic falls apart like a rank of baby-back ribs and turns into an empire while the Jedi Order is destroyed at the hands of their clone troopers and the face of a once noble Jedi is reduced to hiding behind a black mask and all of this encourages fear, the fear of despair and that's when the viewer begins to bit by bit understand that all of this is just part of the larger plan from the Jedi to the Emperor himself, everyone is nothing more but a chess piece in a game bigger than themselves and every word that is spoken by each character becomes a key to a much bigger puzzle that attends to the Empire and before you realize what's happening, it's already too late.As the former student of the Light Side whispers to the Dark Lord of The Sith with anguish and commitment, he asks that he help him save his wife's life. At this moment, the hero we know as Anakin Skywalker ceases to be along with the Republic, the Jedi, and his own wife thus giving birth to Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith and the future terror of the galaxy who instills dread and panic in every living being, being driven by loathing and pain and in the eyes of something such as love is shown and the most horrific thing is that it is unavoidable. As the Jedi continue to dig themselves into a hole, the Sith are waiting for them. This is what war feels like and what pain feels like. Order 66, the clone army, The Jedi, Padme, Anakin; everything comes together here in this climatic roller coaster ride. By themselves, these issues aren't important at first glance but when they are seen together, they create a much more chaotic and problematic situation. In the span of one hour, we see everything that the galaxy has been building for centuries totally destroyed and therefore, the viewer sees both the Light and the Dark Sides come together in this battle along with the differences of each of the opposing players. Good and evil, the Jedi and the Sith, Obi-Wan, and Anakin, Yoda and Palpatine, Anakin and Padme, the Republic and The Empire. All of these various plot threads come together almost seamlessly in this epic conclusion in a way that never feels forced upon the viewer.Another aspect of the prequel films that Revenge of The Sith improves upon is by serving as a link between these movies and Episodes 4, 5 and 6 as here, we finally see the character of Anakin Skywalker fall to the dark side of the Force and how he becomes the most badass villain in all of film history, Darth Vader. On top of delivering on what was previously shown in Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith also has the massive task of showing us how the Clone Wars ended, how a vile Empire rose from the ashes of a self-governing Republic as well as how characters like Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan found themselves by the time A New Hope begins . Now, with all these tremendous character arches and plot trends, it's a wonder that George Lucas even made this all work but somehow, all these plot beats and loose ends manage to work well and tie up all the loose ends from the previous two prequel films without straying far from the main focus of the story: Anakin being tempted by Palpatine as well as Anakin turning his back on everything he loves and becoming something else entirely. Upon seeing visions of his wife dying while given birth, Anakin becomes desperate to save her and rather expect that death is beyond his control, he confides in Palpatine and it's from there that he begins to plant the last few seeds of dissent in Anakin's mind and convinces him that the Jedi don't respect him and that in order to understand the true power of the Force, Anakin must embrace a larger view of it which in turn makes him question his loyalty towards the Jedi even more and thus he gives in to his fear of loss and turns to the dark side.This kind of manipulation is effective not only for the sake of the story but also for the sake of the character of Anakin and while I still find him a bit bratty and whiny here, it's easy to have at least some sympathy for Anakin here as we see everything he ever loved or cared about being taken away from him simply because of his own lust for control and power to make things the way he wants them which is a far cry from the arrogant teenager we saw him as in Attack of The Clones. At least George is trying to make us care about Anakin and how his actions affect not only those he loves but also the galaxy as a whole. The whole temptation of Anakin works so perfectly in the film and when the seeds of deception are embedded in his head, there's no turning back for our hero. It also helps that despite my strong dislike for The Phantom Menace and Attack of The Clones, I do understand what George wanted to do with the character of Anakin and how he wanted to show how a good person turns evil but sadly, the way that George chose to tell the story of Anakin's fall wasn't the best choice and left me caring very little about Anakin's journey but with Revenge of the Sith turned that around and allows us to focus our attention on the moment in the film where the camel's back breaks. Anakin's last descent into darkness shot alongside the Empire's rise to power is a masterclass in visual storytelling. The way that Palpatine seduces Anak",10,0,0,31 March 2019
Halloween," A game changer for horror movies
","When it comes to the horror genre, Halloween was always a movie that seemed to pass me by, but I decided to give it a watch for the month of October and I absolutely loved it! From it's haunting score and brilliant lighting to it's genuinely frightening killer, Halloween is a true masterpiece of horror and without it, the slasher genre wound never have existed.The movie opens in 1963 where a 6 year old boy named Michael Meyers murders his sister in cold blood. We then cut to 21 years later where Michael's doctor, Sam Loomis appears at the sanatarium where Meyers is been held to take him to court, but before he can do that, Michael nicks the car and speeds off towards Haddonfield while Loomis chases after him. Soon after arriving home, Meyers starts following high school student Laurie Strode and she starts to notch him following her, but her friends laugh at her worries while Loomis meets with the town sheriff and warns him about the danger the town is in. Now, Loomis must stop Meyers from killing again while at the same time Laurie is completely unaware of the danger that is approaching her.Much like what Sam Raimi did with the first Evil Dead movie, John Carpenter was able to take a tiny budget of 320,000 dollars and frightened the living hell out of an entire generation of film-watchers and was able to demonstrate that a great horror film doesn't need a high budget or a lot of blood and gore in order to arouse a sense of dread in it's audience and sometimes the finest aspect of horror isn't what happens but what is going to happen like what is that shadow that passed by the window or what is that commotion coming from upstairs? Carpenter understands how to use these elements to scare the viewer and he uses every factor of classic horror that a director can use and he may have included some of his own ideas into the final product, something I wish more horror directors would use these days rather than just using the same clichéd horror tropes to provoke a frightening reaction from the audience and it just isn't scary. The viewer isn't going to be scared by jump-scares and a huge CGI monster that bounces out of a wall time after time, rather it's the occasions where the murderer is hiding somewhere, but the viewer just never knows where he'll pop up next that scares people and Halloween certainly accomplishes that in a way that few horror movies can even attempt to do while also being set in a suburban neighborhood rather in out in the woods makes for a much more accessible setting for a slasher movie implying that something like this could happen anywhere. What Carpenter also does with Halloween is he takes an incredibly eerie film score, misleading lighting tactics and yet was still able to create a truly masterful piece of horror film history.One scene is a perfect representation of this and it's where one of the girls is on her way to get her boyfriend and she tries to unlock the car door only to recognize that she forgot her car keys in the house, she fetches them and returns to the car and unwittingly opens it on her own and while the viewer is able to understand what's happening but the character doesn't have a clue about what is happening so when she does sit down, she sees that the car windows are muddled up. She's confused by this and attempts to brush it off, then Meyers attacks like a pit viper from the back seat. This scene is absolutely fantastic simply because of how it pays close attention to detail as the audience knows what's going to take place but the victim is completely clueless which makes it all the more scary when Michael attacks, but it's also the insightful conclusions John Carpenter made with this movie that have scared film-goers since 1978.To heighten the sense of dread and terror, Halloween makes use of fuzzy imagery of the murderer loitering in the background, the shadows darkly drift over a wall, rooms illuminated only in darkness, a disturbing story of a boy who killed his own sister and a dangerous and ruthless murderer. Any future horror filmmaker should make a point to watch and analyze Halloween as this movie is the archetype for horror films are all about, hell even Carpenter sought to emulate Alfred Hitchcock with this movie so there's no reason why future horror film directors won't look to Halloween for inspiration. John's camera work is nothing short of perfect but also remains incredibly creepy while continuing to remain erratic throughout the course of the movie and of course, the musical score to Halloween is perfect in every possible way with the central theme being identifiable right when the movie starts and is a memorably cinematic film score that crushes any other opposing horror movie score with it's foot.Of course, a movie like Halloween would be nothing without great characters and the actors who bring them to life and it's got both. Nancy Keys and PJ Soles do a fine job as the everyday teenyboppers who quickly meet their doom at the hands of Meyers, Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are believable as the two kids, but It's Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis who are the stars. Jamie comes across as a hardy yet likable lead and as the movie progresses, you are behind her and don't want to see her get killed. Curtis was born to play this role and she pulls it off with zero difficulty while Donald Pleasance is outstanding as Dr. Loomis, bringing a cool and reserved but occasionally eerie feeling to this character.Honestly, what else is there to say about Halloween that hasn't been said already. Go see it for yourself.",10,0,1,18 October 2017
Fifty Shades of Grey," Half my brain is missing thanks to this movie.
","When it comes to the best selling book, 50 Shades of Gray, I was never familiar with it nor did I ever read it, I only became aware of the movie after I saw a trailer of it and I had no interest in seeing it due to it's content. So late last year, I plucked up courage and sat down to watch 50 Shades of Gray and I absolutely despised it. From it's piss-poor writing and uncomfortable sex scenes to it's god-awful acting, this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.The story begins with a collage girl named Anastasia Steele who goes to interview billionaire Christian Gray when her roommate is unable to go. Upon arriving at his office, Anastasia fumbles her way though the interview but Gray takes a shine to her. After she leaves, he stakes her at her job and soon begins to shower her with gifts and she attends a photo-shoot with him. Later on, Gray attempts to get Ana to sigh an agreement to stop her from telling anyone about their love affair and tells her that he only has relationships that involve bondage defined by a contract. What follows in Ana being Gray's sex slave while Christian's more interesting side comes into play.This day in age, some people no longer understand what acceptable or excellent is but instead settling on uninspired and consider that great and the benchmark for what movies and filmmaking should be and it sadly seems that even something as wretched and foul as 50 Shades of Garbage can't even be considered dull but rather just laughably bad as there are people who have praised this movie for the actors and for being so romantic, something I clearly didn't see. While I have never read the book, it seems that a lot of people who have read it hated it as in order for the reader to like it, they needed to use their intelligence. The successfulness of the book is established in its fictional viewpoints and while imagination can provide a person with certain feelings than most other things, the movie certainly doesn't live up to what it promises even for the most idiotic minds, let alone somebody with a wildly gifted mind. The only desire the movie will grant you is how quick you can rush out of the theater or how fast you can turn off your TV.As somebody who against sexual abuse including BDSM, every time Christian and Ana are on screen making love, it made me groan in pain and was gut-wrenching to watch. The failure of the screenwriter to develop the sexual relationship between these two is nothing short of appalling and while Christian may appear to be every woman's dream man but instead molests a young woman simply because he had issues with his own mother and is committed to using abuse to get what he wants rather than actually having a relationship with Ana who seems to have no sexual fondness until she meets Christian and yet willfully goes along with anything he asks her to do even if it means her getting abused just shows me how sick and perverted this movie truly is.If you read an actual romance book like Outlander, the lead is somber and disturbed for reasons that have significance and ability and is someone who commands admiration, not expect it just because they're a rich playboy and who has already shown themselves in ways that consist of pain, blood and jeopardy, not by pushing women to have sex with him though bullying tactics. How E.L. James was able to take a moronic Twilight fan fiction and turn that into a best selling series then into a movie franchise is beyond me. A 26 year old tycoon and a shy collage girl who feels the need to say oh my every few minutes, seriously?! Is this what writing from a woman's perspective has become?! Great job on that one, Kelly Marcel. Of course, there have been people who have watched the movie or read the book who have disregarded that throughout the movie, there is molestation, non consensual lovemaking and lots of physical, spoken and emotional abuse where Christian beats, spanks, hits and bullies Ana and he even controls every aspect of her life from the food she eats to how long she sleeps and yet shows not even a crumb of love for her. What kind of person would do something like that?! In fact, I would so far to call Christian and Ana just might be the worst on-screen couple since Edward and Bella.As for the script, it's a complete joke, something that would have been laughed off the Lifetime Channel. The dialog is easily the worst I've ever heard spoken in a feature film. In fact, the movie seems to be adrift in whatever time period it is as there are times throughout the movie where certain words are used in a certain way that is intended to come across as edgy and outrageous but it instead comes across as pathetic while the character growth is non-existent which is made even more laughable because the two leads have zero on-screen chemistry which left me not caring about either one of them nor are they interesting in any capacity. Yeah, Gray's taste in women may be seen as appealing to some but it comes across as repulsive. For the viewer to become attached to a lead in a movie, it has to be because he or she is charismatic or has a backstory that is interesting or makes us feel for them, things Bela Lugosi in Dracula has because people find him compelling and not because of him being a vampire but because he's a man with a past along with actual individuality and charm while Christian Gray is a bland and blank slate devoid of any personality or charisma.The performances are just as bad, but not even Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett could have worked with such horrible dialog, and while Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dorian are god-awful in their roles, a lot of that can be attested to director Sam Taylor-Johnson's lifeless directing and the fact that the two leads didn't like working with each other. Dakota is far from convincing as Anastasia and comes across as a vapid and weak woman who needs a man to be with her at all times and Johnson fails at playing the part while Dorian comes across as an overbearing, creepy and unlikable moron who can't seem to be able to smile throughout the entirety of the film but instead uses the same idiotic, overly-somber facial movements for the duration of the movie. All the supporting characters are equally pointless and uninteresting.The one great thing about this mess of celluloid is the photography and aerial shots; they look spectacular particularly the in-fight shots of Seattle or when Ana and Christian are flying, but apart from that, 50 Shades of Gray is not worth watching, I beg you, please do not go see this movie. Your brain and soul will thank you for it. In fact, watching paint dry would be more entertaining then watching this movie.",1,1,3,7 March 2018
Iron Man," Marvel's second golden age begins here.
","Having never read the Iron Man comics as a kid and having never seen this film when it first came out in '08, I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch it. Would it be dark and complex, overly campy or a fun action romp? Well, I can say Iron Man totally blew me away from its action and visual effects to its acting and writing. After watching this, it's hard to imagine what the MCU would have been without this movie.We start off in the deserts of Afghanistan where a military convoy is escorting millionaire playboy Tony Stark to show off his new 'Jericho' missile. The convoy is then attacked and Tony is significantly wounded by one of his own weapons. Tony is then captured and imprisoned by a terrorist organization called the Ten Rings. Stark discovers that an electromagnet has been embedded into his chest to prevent shrapnel from reaching his heart and killing him. The Ten Rings Leader Raza then offers Tony his freedom in return for Tony building a Jericho missile for the group, but Stark has no intention of keeping his word. With the help of fellow inmate, Yinsen, Tony builds an arc reactor to charge the electromagnet and a suit of armor. Following his escape from the cave and returning home, Stark shows up at a press meeting and announces that his company will no longer make weapons after what he witnessed earlier in the film. He also builds an enhanced version of the suit plus a new arc reactor. Now, Tony must fight his inner demons as well as putting his talents to making the world better.While superhero films have become an everyday factor in the summer blockbuster season, one question always comes up: how does one make a comic book film stand out in the middle of so much superhero completion while remaining faithful to the comics? It seems John Favreau has that covered. Right from the opening chords of 'Back in Black' it becomes obvious that Iron Man is a different kind of superhero movie. Rather than go the Christopher Nolan route by making the movie as darker and grittier than its source material ever needed to be, Favreau isn't afraid to welcome a much needed sense of fun without diverting into outright silliness. In the process, Iron Man essays an outstanding balance between welcoming every entertaining element while preserving the seriousness and difficulty of the origin story and the characters. Also by modernizing Tony's backstory from Vietnam to Afghanistan, the movie adds a touch of political tragedy, making a few tongue in cheek remarks about the US military in the process.The script is one of the things that really sell this film, with a string of intelligently written lines, a far cry from some of the more overused Hollywood writing that could've been thought by your ordinary six year old. Robert Altman's influence on the script leads to several humorous ad-libbing on top of the written material.Favreau doesn't hold back when it comes to the action and the visual effects, resulting in some enthralling action set pieces such as a fight in an Afghan village and a final show down between Iron Man and Iron Monger, not to mention some truly edgy scenes as well as the adrenaline pumping scene of Stark testing his Mark 1 armor during his escape. The special effects are flawless and are carried out perfectly without overwhelming the movie's overall story. Iron Man's armor looks stunning, a clinking mass of machinery that come together with a heart beating exterior. The same can also be said for the musical score which delivers some aptly heroic themes.Of course, this movie wouldn't be half the movie it is without its cast and what a cast: Gwyneth Paltrow is surprisingly believable as Pepper Potts, her charm and cool comebacks easily being an excellent foil to Tony's livewire performance and brings some serious-minded glow of sexual tightness and interaction between her and Tony. Jeff Bridges molds his normal laid-back look into a wickedly conniving businessperson hiding his self-centered dealings under a façade of decency and while it was interesting to see Bridges play a villain, he did a great job, Terrence Howard provides an appropriately brisk aroma of self-respect as Tony's friend, James Rhodes, enhancing his performance with just the perfect amount of deadpan delivery, but the real star here is Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man. I can't praise his performance enough as he is the key element to making Iron Man stand out amongst other comic book films. Easily the best performance in his career, Downey fluently makes every single inch of Tony his own and puts an unconventional spin on the character through his wisecracking, smart mouthed dynamism while still staying true to Stark's character, even making the shift from an arrogant playboy to a humanitarian wearing an iron suit possible through his personality and his shining, zealous strength. There are some obvious parallels between Tony and RDJ's personal lives when it comes to the excess and women. Downey plays a bit of a double-faced role here as Stark and Iron Man, on one hand being his lavish self whose duty is the maintenance of his father's company vs his own mission to become a better person. The dialog given to Robert in every scene is full of one-liners finished in quick time. To say that RDJ was born to play this role is an understatement; he is and will always be Iron Man. Even Samuel Jackson has a brief appearance as S.H.I.E.L.D agent, Nick Fury who sets the scene for later events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Iron Man is a perfect superhero movie. I really don't have any issues with it, it just rocks all around. So do yourselves a favor and give this film a watch, you'll enjoy it.",10,2,3,9 February 2015
Blade Runner," A rare gem in the sci-fi movie genre.
","When I was growing up, Blade Runner was never a sci-fi movie that really interested me as it just bored me to tears but as I got older and watched it more, I began to see it for what it is and it's become one of my favorite movies ever. From it's themes and visuals to it's acting and stellar musical score, Blade Runner is a true gem of a sci-fi movie.Set in the future of 2019 Los Angeles, the story follows a retried cop or 'blade runner' named Rick Deckard who is apprehended by a fellow police officer and brought before his former supervisor and is briefed that four androids have appeared on Earth illegally in order to enhance their lives. Following this, Rick goes to the Tyrell Corporation and meets its founder, Eldon Tyrell and his associate Rachael and performs a test on her to see if she is a replicant or not. Events then continue to pan out as Deckard continues to pursue the replicants while the replicants continue to seek out Tyrell to get him to give them more life.While many critics and film-goers have considered Blade Runner to be one of the best sci-fi films ever put to screen, the movie isn't your typical sci-fi romp and it does call for the viewer to pay close attention to what's going on and to use their brain and have appreciation for what is happening in order to understand what the film is conveying. As Blade Runner is a film that focuses on ideas rather than the familiar sci-fi spacecraft fights, high-tech devices, bizarre aliens or witty dialog, some people will have an issue with those not being in the movie, but it still certifies itself as a science fiction movie in its observation of technology's effects on our civilization, our journey as a species, and the very spirit of mankind itself. These subjects are arranged against an underlying investigation plot that advances nonchalantly but gently builds to a fitting conclusion as the observer is engrossed in the visuals and look of the movie. One complaint I've heard about the movie is that Deckard and the replicants are incredibly weak in terms of character evolution, but as this is a more confined and deep-thinking film, the main individuals are used as tools to reflect the motifs in the movie. Every main lead in the film mirrors a characteristic of humankind and yet they miss other characteristics for each one is shattered in ways that echo the fractured world in which they dwell in and were built. As for the movie's themes, they're some of the best in any sci-fi film like de-humanizing of the population though a culture fashioned by technology and capitalist overkill, the parts of the maker and his design, the shared slavery and character switching, emotion, thought, ambition, passion, malice, prowess over nature and the cosmos, death, demise, individuality, self-realization and the meaning of life itself.Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker and Blade Runner is the film that shows his directing talents in the best way and like Stanley Kubrick before him, Scott understands just how to illuminate a scene and the usage of fog machines and fans along with anything that alters light is what gives Blade Runner it's noir look and feel while leaving hints throughout the film to the most important question concerning Deckard and wither or not he is a replicant. The visual effects are absolutely outstanding with the incredibly detailed miniatures and matte paintings along with the plumes of fire and the flying cars make the world of Los Angeles come to life and it's clear that the effects people put their time and money into making the visuals and effects look as top-notch as possible and it works a treat. Easily one of the most gorgeous sci-fi movies ever put to screen. Apart from the visual effects, the other outstanding element that makes Blade Runner stand on it's own is the fantastic musical score by Vangelis. The approach he uses when composing is incredibly distinctive and the music is moving is every scene that it's used in. The movie's soundtrack flawlessly adds to the futuristic setting ad even aids in building the vibe of it's world. Some films like Star Wars or Jaws owe some of their achievements to their composers, but with Blade Runner being such a unique movie in terms of visuals and story, it still would have still been an awesome movie even with a contrasting musical score, but all the same, it's certainly one of the finest movie soundtracks ever composed.When it comes to the acting, it's absolutely flawless and some of the best of any sci-fi movie. Sean Young is wonderful as the experiment replicant Rachel, giving us a conventional yet compelling performance and it's a treat to watch. Daryl Hannah is great as Pris as is Joanna Cassidy as Zhora. Edward James Olmos is fantastic as Officer Gaff as is M. Emmett Walsh as Bryant, but it's Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who are the stars of the film. Harrison is excellent in Blade Runner, playing a much more somber character than what he played in Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but it still makes for one hell of a performance. Ford speaks every word with a aura of coolness and effectiveness as well as maintaining a hard-edged yet sensitive appearance as Deckard. Rutger Hauer is on top form as the villainous Roy Batty and completely steals all the scenes he's in, especially with his speech at the end which is truly moving.Now I do have an issue with the movie and it's the romance between Deckard and Rachel, it just comes across as tracked on and weak, but aside form that, Blade Runner is a true sci-fi classic that changed the way we saw sci-fi and what the future could be. Definitely a movie worth watching.",10,2,4,10 October 2017
X2: X-Men United," The Empire Strikes Back of the X-men films
","Having already seen the first X-men movie and loved it, I couldn't wait to watch the follow-up, X-Men 2 and it didn't let me down. From it's themes and action scenes to the acting and direction, X-men 2 is a superior sequel to the first one in almost every possible way.The movie begins with a indoctrinated mutant named Nightcrawler breaking into the White House and tries to kill the president but is unable to and flees. In the meantime, Wolverine journeys to an old army base in Canada to find evidence about his past but discovers nothing. Professor X locates Nightcrawler and sends Jean Gray and Strom to find him, while William Stryker gets permission from the president to examine the X Mansion for it's mutant ties. Stryker's forces than attack the mansion and abduct several students while Wolverine and a few other mutants are able to escape while Professor X and Cyclops are also captured. Now, the remaining X-men and Magneto must unite to save the professor and stop Stryker from executing his plans of destroying all of mutant kind.With sequels, remakes and reboots being the main summer blockbusters these days, it's becoming harder and harder to find an action movie that has the capability to grasp your mind and engage your concentration so rigidly and doesn't let go until the film ends, X-Men 2 is one such movie. Usually, there are only a handful of movies where the follow-up is able to take all the previous elements from the first movie, effectively toss out anything that doesn't work and goes on to not only smash people's doubts or any kind of excitement for the movie but also utterly revalues and enhances the genre's credibility like The Dark Knight or Terminator 2. Given how the X-men feel more political and emotional than most other superheroes, the main aspects of the story lie with the characters and their battles for acceptance, their thoughts on how the world sees them, their relationships with each other, and how they all play a part in the story at hand while at the films core lies something a lot of modern action movies lack: heart.But it's also thanks to director Brian Singer's obviously endless capabilities to accurately portray the authentic essence of the comics in a way that only a few directors have been able to do. Singly, wither they be hero, villain or as a team, Brian has managed to touch upon the emotional center of the comics and bring all these heroes and villains together in a movie that has no need for epic battles or witty dialog, but instead focuses on the lost arts of character development and interaction. Now, that's not saying that Singer follows the comics note for note as he does change things, but doesn't destroy it like what Josh Trank did to Fant4stic and while Brian's version of the X-men allows the viewer to appreciate that any changes made to the team are for the better like how skillfully Singer handles the character of Jean Gray and her hidden abilities as he reinterprets this variation by still bestowing her this power but using it to develop Jean as a character and allows the viewer to see the abilities she has and at the same time, Singer treats her along with the viewing audience and the fans with the utmost admiration while another fine case in Singer's abilities of character analysis is taking a villain like William Stryker who was a religious fanatic in the comics and turning him into a more dangerous bigot who still retrains some of his original holier-than-thou attitude but making Stryker a military man makes him even more ruthless and evil allowing Singer to give us a more complex and developed villain with a clear-cut plan and by adding in important sub-plots and characters that are used effectively make the movie what it is.The movie's screenplay is able to juggle it's vast amount of characters without feeling too rushed as it gives each hero and villain a decent amount of development as well as has a change to have their moment without the movie feeling too cumbersome while there are plenty of Easter eggs for fans of the comics that don't endanger the course of the story. The movie also has a lot more smooth action scenes than the first one including Nightcrawler's spectacular attack on the White House and Wolverine slicing and dicing Stryker's men during the attack on the X mansion while John Ottman gives us some incredible and catchy themes that complement the movie while the editing and cinematography are to a high level.Of course, the movie would be nothing without it's cast and it delivers that on a silver platter. Ian McKellan continues to show his acting credibility as Magneto and he doesn't hold back when it comes to the malice and warmongering, yet brings a level of class to the character as does Patrick Stewart as Professor X by conveying a relaxed grace as well as all the characteristics of a father figure and leader while Halle Berry brings the usual believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Anna Paquin is back as Rouge and gives a fantastic performance as does James Marsden as Cyclops, even if he's given little to do, Rebecca Romjin once again brings a dangerous edge to Mystique. Shawn Ashmore is believable as Iceman, showing great emotional range while being very likable. Aaron Stanford is great as Pyro, Famkie Jensen is again fantastic as Jean Grey and is given quite a lot of development which makes her all the more relatable. Allan Cummings is fantastic as Nightcrawler while Brian Cox plays a wonderfully menacing William Stryker. Hugh Jackman once again kills it as Wolverine and has completely made the role his own from the action scenes to the emotional moments.Go watch this movie, it's truly awesome.",10,2,3,5 December 2017
Thor: The Dark World," One of the most surprising movies I've ever watched.
","After seeing the first Thor movie, I wasn't sure how I would like this film because the first film completely blew my mind, so I thought that Thor: The Dark World wasn't going to be as good. Clearly, that wasn't the case because I found Thor: The Dark World to be an action-packed thrill ride with a lot of humor and action, but there were a few minor issues that held it back from being as good as the first one.The film opens with an backstory about The Dark Elves and their leader, Malekith who seeks to plunge the universe into everlasting darkness by using a weapon called the Aether, but before he can carry out his plan, Odin's father, Bor, invades the Elves' home world, takes the Ather and seals it deep within the earth. We then cut to the present day where Loki is thrown in jail for his war crimes in The Avengers, while Thor is busy cleaning up the mess his half-brother has cased. Meanwhile, Dr. Jane Foster is transported to another world and is processed by the it, spending Thor to come to Earth for Jane, but Malekith has sensed the Aether and comes to Asgard looking for it, and Thor now must protect Jane and The Aether from him.The change in directors provides a nice change of pace with Alan Taylor replacing Kenneth Branagh and typically, a change in directors proves to be a severe disadvantage to the movie like Brian Singer leaving X-men 3 and having Bertt Ratner direct, but not in this case. Taylor gives this film a feeling of depth and a much more epic size and scoop to it than the first film had and made it much more darker, but at the same time, more humorous.Now, one might think that injecting Nose mythology with sci-fi would sound like a ludicrous idea but the way that it's added into the story really does make the movie better. The visuals, production design, costumes and overall look of the movie is fantastic and Asgard seems a lot more tangible than the first movie and we get a much larger look at the place plus we get to see other places in the 9 Realms with Svartalfheim being a deserted wilderness. While the first Thor movie certainly had some bad-ass fight sequences, I feel that Thor: The Dark World ups the ante when it comes to the action and getting to see more of Thor using Mjolnir is always wonderful to watch with the two stand-out action scenes are the battle on Vanaheim and the showdown between Thor and Malekith. The humor makes this movie much more enjoyable to watch and it's just hilarious like when Loki, Thor, and Jane are flying a spaceship out of Asgard and Thor is constantly crashing into things or when Jane slaps Loki over the events in New York.As with all the MCU l films that I've seen already, almost all the cast in Thor: The Dark World hit the mark and seem to wear their roles like a well-made outfit: It's pretty clear that Chris Hemsworth has really matured into the character of Thor by being less arrogant and more humble but still maintaining the same level of charm and charisma he did in the first one and virtually dominates the screen. Much like Robert Downey Jr. always being Iron Man or Chris Evans always being Captain America, Hemsworth is and will always be Thor, no questions asked. Tom Hiddleson once again brings his A game when playing Loki conveying a performance that allows the viewer to see what is one of the best written movie anti-heroes ever. What makes Loki such a wonderful character is how torn he is between what his heart says and his lust for power, consistently trying to hold back the attacks of despair buzzing inside him. Continually withdrawn and devious, Hiddleson plays Loki in a way that's oddly fascinating and even though he's scheming and untrustworthy, the pain and suffering he goes though tugs at the heartstrings yet you can't help but love him, plus the scene where he's stabbed and lays dying in Thor's arms is truly one of the most emotional moments in the whole MCU. Natalie Portman returns as Dr. Jane Foster and is just as charming and attractive as he was in the first movie and the chemistry between her and Hemsworth just radiates whenever they are together on screen. Renee Russo gets to have more screen time in this film as Frigga and puts in a pretty solid performance. Anthony Hopkins is and will always be Odin and plays the role perfectly in this movie, playing the old knowledgeable father, but at the same time, being serious when need be. Jamie Alexander, Zachary Levi, Ray Stevenson and Tadanobu Asano are all good in their roles. Christopher Eccleston is effective as Malekith, but I do feel he could have been more fleshed out as a villain and his motivation left a lot to be desired. I never liked Kat Dennings as Darcy in the first film and I still found her to be even more annoying in this film. As for Stellen Skarsgard, he does overact a tad too much here, but it's not a major problem.On the whole though, I liked Thor: The Dark World just as much as the first one. It improved on a couple of things from the first film and added a much darker story. Throw in some great action scenes, some nice romantic moments, awesome visuals and great performances and you have one awesome Marvel film. I will recommend this movie to any Marvel fan or anyone who likes comic book films and be sure to stick around for not one, but two mid-credit scenes at the end of the movie.",9,0,1,11 May 2015
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A cinematic trendsetter
","In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me and my love of film as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. When I was growing up, the first film in the Star Wars saga: A New Hope was never my favorite as I always preferred Return of the Jedi over it but in more recent years after watching the film more times when I even care to count, I began to see the film more for what it was and still is as Star Wars: A New Hope is still to this day a classic thanks to its story, characters, and storytelling motifs. Simply put, Hollywood and the filmmaking landscape would look very different without this film.The movie opens with a massive Star Destroyer pursuing a Rebel blockade runner as the rebels feel with stolen plans to the Empire's newest weapon. Try as they might, the rebel ship is captured by the Imperials under the command of the Sith Lord, Darth Vader. In a last-ditch effort to save the plans, Princess Leia hides them in the memory banks of the droid R2-D2 before she is captured. R2 and his counterpart C-3PO flee the ship in an escape pod to the desert planet called Tatooine. Upon their landing, the pair separate and are captured by Jawa traders who then sell the droids off to moisture farmers Owen and Beru Lars and their step-nephew Luke Skywalker. While cleaning R2, Luke stumbles across Leia's message to the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi and tells his aunt and uncle of what he has discovered. They tell him to ignore the message but Luke feels that Owen and Beru are hiding something from him. Upon discovering that R2-D2 has run away to find Obi-Wan, Luke and C-3PO leave the next morning to find him. After being attacked by a band of Tuskan Riders, Luke is saved by Obi-Wan who takes the trio to his hut and tells Luke of his days as a Jedi and gives Luke his father's lightsaber. Upon hearing Leia's message, Obi-Wan tries to convince Luke to join him but Luke refuses, not wanting to disappoint his uncle. Later on, Luke returns home and sees the charred corpses of his aunt and uncle and decides to join Obi-Wan and learn the ways of the Jedi. The four travel to Mos Eisley where they meet smuggler Han Solo who agrees to take them to Alderaan. Meanwhile, The Empire, eager to test the firepower of their new superweapon, destroy the planet. When the Millennium Falcon reaches the location of where Alderaan is supposed to be, the team discovers that the planet has been totally destroyed. Off in the distance, they see what appears to be a small moon but it's not and is in fact The Death Star. The ship attempts to turn around but is caught in the space station's tractor beam and can't escape. Now, the team must find the princess and get the plans to the Rebel Alliance before it's too late.Now, Star Wars: A New Hope is a glorious, world-spanning heroic blockbuster even though some may see it as a galactic fairy tale or an old samurai story or even an action-adventure film. Even since A New Hope came out in 1977, moviegoers and film critics alike have twisted themselves in all kinds of directions trying to explain the appeal of Star Wars by referencing several different genres of film. There's no one quite as accomplished at doing this than George Lucas, who has compared his space fantasy to a Spaghetti Western, an Arthurian quest, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Lawrence of Arabia, Flash Gordon and even the James Bond franchise and even that series had been going on before the first Star Wars was even filmed. Steer through this asteroid field of various elements, and what you have at the very heart of the Star Wars universe is a straightforward, playful subgenre: space fantasy. Space fantasy is to science fiction as what Luke Skywalker is to Darth Vader. Lucas came a lot closer to traditional science fiction with his first film, THX 1133 and soon rejected it for it being too realistic and too depressing. In the realm of science fiction, it's merely a projection of what we think the future might be like. The basis of technology and it's impact on our society is the focus there. Sure, there's some effort to stick to the tangible laws of the universe as it is fiction that just happens to be about science whereas space fantasy is basically a fairy tale in space. Science fiction reflects our world while space fantasy surpasses our world. It's more nostalgic and intimate and more adventurous, taking machinery and using it as a mere starting point as well as casting aside all the rules of physics in favor of fun. Of course, it would be Edgar Rice Burroughs' seminal 1912 pulp comic A Princess of Mars which would, in turn, lay the groundwork for Star Wars to later build upon as it's lead hero, John Carter is often sighted as being the first superhero and a model for the character of Luke Skywalker. Of course, John Carter of Mars isn't the only space fantasy epic to inspire Star Wars as the works of Leigh Brackett, many of the early pulp magazines, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon were all massive influences on the film as well as they gave Lucas not only ideas for crafting his space epic from the idea of the lightsaber to the visual identity of the Star Wars saga, but also aided George when he was coming up with the blueprint for the story and characters.When he was adapting THX 1138, George Lucas had the word 'Force' echoing in his head and while he would cut the idea from THX: 1138, the idea still hung around in his mind, crying out to be developed as an idea for a future movie. George's goal here wasn't to add a new religious belief but to merely broil other spiritual beliefs down to their purest essence. In A New Hope, the idea of the Force is so fundamental a concept as to be globally enticing: a faith for the nonspiritual age simply because it's so lacking in detail. Anyone can add their own layer of meaning to it. In one scene in Star Wars: A New Hope, Obi-Wan explains the concept of the Force to Luke Skywalker in just a few well-picked words and in this sentence, the Force is summed up as a binding, mystical energy field created by all living beings. Besides what Kenobi tells us, the Force is still largely a riddle. The viewer learns throughout the film that it has a powerful grip on those who are weak-minded and that there is also a Dark Side of the Force that consumed Darth Vader and that Vader feels that the Force is far more powerful than any kind of technology and that he uses it to choke people. Luke is trained to let go of his understand and reach out with his feelings and that the Force will always be with him while Han Solo sees the Force as a corny religion and not a good replacement for a nice blaster, but later wishes for the Force to be with Luke. Obi-Wan vanishes once Vader's lightsaber kills him, prompting moviegoers to assume that it had something to do with the Force, but this was never explained in the next five films in the saga. Luke is able to destroy the Death Star because he turns off his targeting computer and uses the Force to win the battle and that's pretty much all George wrote for the first Star Wars film in terms of explaining the Force and what it is. Sure, this was expanded upon in Empire Strikes Back by Yoda but again, we aren't told very much about the Force and while later attempts to build upon that always felt out of keeping with the film's space fantasy origins. The instant Lucas decided to add any kind of logical or accurate explanation to the knowledge of the Force in the form of the outrageous minichlorians into The Phantom Menace caused many a Star Wars fan to revolt even though if one digs a bit deeper, they would discover that Lucas had been talking about minichlorians as early as 1977 but to me, the Force is better left as a mystery rather than having an explanation dumped on me. If one wants to see the Force in reality, one only has to look at religion and art rather than science. The Force can be seen as a Navajo prayer, a Buddhist meditation chat or a Christian hymn yet it is all of these things and none of them as anyone can see what they wish to see in it. I personally see the Force as a mystical binding energy field that flows through every living thing even if the Force may not exist in the world.As George Lucas prepared to outline plans for his space fantasy epic, he wasn't the only one. At that time, other filmmakers were conjuring up film projects that were similar. Much like THX 1138 wasn't exactly the first post-apocalyptic film in the early 70s', Star Wars: A New Hope was merely one of a bunch of space fairy tale films. The starting point for Star Wars came in the form of Stanly Kubrick's 10 million dollar science-fiction game changer 2001: A Space Odyssey that didn't click with moviegoers when it first came out but it did click with many filmmakers like John Carpenter and Steven Spielberg as they began to look for the next science fiction hit, something that would become the next 2001. Lucas's victory in this field was by no means a sure thing as it seemed that in the early 1970s, many science fiction films dealt with post-apocalyptic societies and death and destruction which often resulted in many of these films such as Silent Running often bombing at the box office so, with Star Wars, George set out to make a film that would not only different from many of the other end of the world science fiction films but would also usher in a sense of fun and optimism for space and its' possible future.Now, one might ask when making a film as iconic and beloved as Star Wars, how you build a film universe from the ground up? George was asking himself that very question when writing the screenplay for A New Hope in 1973 as he had done something more vague with THX 1138 but by doing that film, Lucas wasn't really tel",10,0,0,31 January 2020
Deadpool," A superhero movie unlike any other.
","When it comes to The Merc with a Mouth, I never read a single one of his comic when I was younger nor did I ever seen Deadpool's first cinematic outing in X-Men Origins: Wolverine so when I heard a Deadpool movie was being made, my interest was peaked so I went to my local theater in February of 2016, watched the movie and I absolutely loved it. From its great writing and humor and awesome action scenes to its brilliant casting, Deadpool is a truly awesome comic book movie that is never afraid to take advantage of its off-the-wall craziness and meta humor and use them to its advantage rather than go dark and gritty.The film begins with an action scene with Deadpool in action and then cuts back to two years before where Wade Wilson, a mercenary for hire meets a prostitute named Vanessa and they soon become lovingly committed. One year later, Wilson pops the question to Vanessa and she says yes, but Wade abruptly collapses and is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Later on, a recruiter from a top-secret program approaches Wade and offers him a chance to cure his cancer, Wilson at first refuses, but decides to undergo the treatment. At a laboratory, he encounters Ajax and Angel Dust who inject him with a serum that will rouse any dormant mutant genes and expose him to weeks of torture and pain to trigger the genes but without any success. Afterward, Wilson mocks Ajax, resulting in him being put into an airtight chamber that puts Wade on the edge of suffocation. After Ajax reveals his true motives to him, Wade attacks Ajax and is subjugated, impaled and left to burn to death. Now, with a disfigured face and revenge on his mind, Wilson adopts the name Deadpool and must find and kill Ajax and save his girlfriend.Tim Miller manages to pull off the impossible with Deadpool: a movie essentially built on fanservice that doesn't pander to or talk down to the fans in any way because Miller is shrewd enough to understand that Deadpool is so much more than just one-liners and gore and sure the story can come across as a bit shallow and unreal but much like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, the real heart of the movie lies in the emotional and character rhythms which are delivered in spades by Miller and the writers. The way the film tells it's story and roots itself in actual pain is compelling and Miller is never afraid to show it by lingering on the tangible and tear-jerking agony of Wade's cancer and the effect it has on his relationship with Vanessa as well as the multilayered torment he puts himself through in order to cure himself by a genetic mutation program which gives him his abilities and turns him into the man we know and love. Yet, underneath all the katanas and meta humor, the movie is really a love story that never seems to devise from that and unlike certain other comic book or even action movies where the token love interest always seems to be thrown in just for the hero to save, the romance between Wade and Vanessa feels natural and real rather than tacked on which is always wonderful to see not to mention the two have wonderful chemistry making the scenes they are in together feel all the more real. The storytelling here is creative by chucking us into an action scene then cuts back and forth in excellent and surprising ways to tell the story of this crazy but oddly likable antihero. Usually, flashbacks and fast-forwards can get tiresome, but then they're done right, they can help make a simple story feel new and thrilling. Given how beloved Deadpool is such a beloved Marvel character, making this movie was a massive risk much like Guardians of the Galaxy but with the right director, writers, cast and crew, the film works so perfectly that it's impossible to see the movie working any other way.The humor in Deadpool is one of the reasons this film works so well with lots of in-humor, references to films like Taken and Robocop, visual jokes, and vulgar jokes that never come across as too raunchy, unlike other modern comedies. There also are some hilarious jabs at Reynolds' previous outing as Deadpool in X-Men Origins: Wolverine like when Ajax threatens to sew Wade's mouth shut or when Wilson says not to make the suit green or animated which is a nice jab at Green Lantern. One of my favorite jokes is when Colossus is taking Deadpool to meet with Professor X and he asks him if James McAvoy or Patrick Stewart is the most recent professor at the institution. Watching Deadpool as well as Wade Wilson cuss like there's no tomorrow, take jabs at other superhero movies among many other comical subjects as well as kill multiple henchmen is nothing short of exciting and always leaves the viewer with a high smile on their face. Every single joke in this movie works and not once did the humor not make me laugh my ass off. Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick knocked it out of the park when it comes to the humor and the writing. The music here is fantastic, ranging from Salt and Pepa to Chicago. It makes perfect sense that Deadpool's theme song is DMX or at least it feel like it should be his theme until Careless Whisper by George Michael kicks in which feels like the writers took a page from Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of using certain songs to fit whatever mode the director wants, something Suicide Squad could learn a thing or two from when it comes to using songs that don't fit the scene. When compared to most other big superhero movies when it comes to action setpieces, Deadpool doesn't have much to show for it due to it's tiny budget but that doesn't mean the action scenes aren't exciting plus seeing fight scenes be kept to a minimum is a stroke of luck in a movie like this, especially when so many action movies nowadays are being destroyed by awful shaky cam rather than use polished and balanced shots with one of the worst offenders being Taken 3 but thankfully, Deadpool doesn't suffer from that trend as the action shots always feel clean and smooth but we're never left hanging when it comes to the fight scenes as the action is quick, ultra-gory and extremely stylish with the opening scene of Deadpool slicing and dicing guys like sashimi and the counting down the bullets scene is joys to watch and the final fight between Deadpool and Ajax is outstanding in every possible way. Tim Miller and cinematographer Ke Seng do a fantastic job crafting efficient and great-looking action scenes that seem to evoke Tarantino's Kill Bill in terms of goriness and style.As for the casting, it' all around fantastic to the point that it's impossible to see these actors play any other role in any other movie. Apart from Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Chris Pratt and Robert Downey Jr. and several others, Ryan Reynolds has proven himself to be one of the finest casting choices for a comic book superhero and Deadpool is the jewel in the crown as Reynolds' obsession for this character gives us a career-defining performance that is instilled with a talent of making even the most crass phrase shine with spirited charisma more so than most other comic book actors. Reynolds makes every single beat of madcap humor, furious rage and pain come so natural that there's an eerie feeling of his Deadpool being lifted straight out of a comic book, playing the role of Wade Wilson and Deadpool as a cross between Peter Vankman from Ghostbusters, James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard and nailing it every single time . Morena Baccarin is perfect as Vanessa, matching Reynolds in delightful crankiness, steering just shy of hot, fanatic-pixie-fantasy-sweetheart typecasting by maintaining just the perfect amount of insane, as well as being a lot better developed than other comic book love interests without being the clichéd damsel in distress or being a token love interest. T.J. Miller is reliably hilarious as Wade's friend, Weasel and steals every scene he's in. Ed Skerin brings plenty of arrogant, muscular cruelty to Ajax which makes him feel a lot less generic than most other action movie villains while Gina Carano works well as Angel Dust. Leslie Uggams is deliciously amusing as Blind Al. Stefan Kapicic and Brianna Hildebrand bring their A game as Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead, allowing for a ton of humorous banter and help keep the action bouncing all the way to the end.Honestly, what else is there to say about Deadpool that other people haven't said already, It's just an all-out funny and action-packed movie that does something different from the traditional superhero movie formula and turns it on its head. Little word of advance, this film is not for kids or anyone who is easily offended, Deadpool is a hard R movie and wears it like a badge of honor so avoid showing this movie to little kids. Also, be sure to stick around for a post-credits stinger that just might get you feeling a little gritty. So go see this movie if you haven't already, you'll have a hell of a time watching it.",10,4,15,15 March 2016
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Violent, gory and just plain fun.
","For someone who has never even heard of the Kingsman comic let alone seen the movie, I was unsure about what I would get when I sat down to watch Kingsman: The Secret Service. Well, mark my words when I say that this movie straight up rocks! From it's fast-paced action and wit to it's homages and mockery of the spy movie genre, this is everything that the modern James Bond movies wished they could be.The movie begins in 1997 where a secret agent named Lee Unwin loses his life to protect his team during a raid. After that, the squad leader Harry Hart gives a medal to the Unwin's widow and her son. 17 years later, a professor is abducted by humanitarian Richmond Valentine while one of Hart's fellow agents code-named 'Lancelot' tries a rescue only to be killed by Valentine's henchwoman. We then cut to Garry 'Eggsy' Unwin living with his mother and stepfather and while he is an smart and gifted young man, he lives the life of a common theft. After being arrested for car theft, Garry is freed and seeing potential in the boy, Hart takes him under his wing to become a Kingman. Now, Eggsy must complete his training and stop Valentine from ending humanity.With the overabundance of comic book films in the last few years, some have fallen into the pit of trying to be too somber or brooding, however where Matthew Vaughn's foresight rests on and what his previous comic-book movies have proved so far is that they walk a fine line to where the tension and solemn character moments conclude and the parody and comedy take over, leaving a distinctive action film that manages to stand out from the watered-down bloodless action films that keep getting released. Kingsman is a movie that's completely unmatched and its own thing while wholly adopting its English cultural roots, even the marketing for the movie takes cues from the Bond films. As Kingsman is an out of the ordinary movie, it works within the context of the spy movie genre by itself but also it takes jabs at spy movies and their clichés that it could be seen as a comedy/spoof much like the Austin Powers films, but personally I see the movie as a complimentary tribute to the genre. The best example of this in the movie is during the cabin fight sequence where there is a jug of whiskey, several men are killed and not a drop of whiskey has been spilled and then Lancelot shoots his fingers at the past and say that they are the future, a perfect homage to the genre. Also, Kingsman mixes the appeal of spy films such as the bizarre gadgets, the exaggerated villain, and the aristocratic spy with new ideas and it does so perfectly while also breathing new life into a genre that has gotten way too serious over the last few years and it's so energizing to watch a movie that isn't nervous to have some fun or make some jokes as opposed to some recent action movies.The way the film is shot is some of the finest I've seen in any action movie and the cinematography is truly eloquent but without the quick cuts and shaky cam that continue to plague modern action films and is mostly done in one shot which gives the movie a bit of fluidity. Of course a great spy movie is nothing without a lot of gory action and Kingsman delivers that in spades and the over-the top violence is one of the movie's largest selling points, now I personally don't care for extreme violence in movies just for the sake of having it, but seeing somebody be killed in a movie without showing any blood or the ramifications of that action is an insult to the viewer and it dilutes their joy when watching the movie. Thankfully, Kingsman doesn't suffer from that which allows Vaughn to go all out with the action and gore and while there are plenty of stand-out action set pieces throughout the film such as a fight in a pub where Harry Hart knocks out several guys with an umbrella or at the end when Eggsy takes on Valentine's henchwoman, the crown jewel of the movie's action scenes is a scene where Harry is in a church where everything breaks loose and people go crazy and shooting commences, easily one of the most perfectly composed action set pieces in any action or comic book movie.Of course, a film of this caliber wouldn't have been as good had it not had a cast of great actors to play these characters, but Kingsman delivers that in spades and every actor plays their role to perfection. Sofia Boutella is deadly and outrageously exciting as the iron leg wearing henchwoman Gazelle. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as the villainous Richmond Valentine and has the right amount of stagecraft to him and yet manages to be quite witty at the same time with his lisp and loathing for blood. Mark Strong is engaging and reliable as Merlin and makes the role even better with his Scottish accent. Sophie Cookson is wonderful as Roxy, however it's Taron Egerton who is the breakout star of the movie and he is incredibly appealing, enduring and downright hilarious and yet still stays true to who his character is and has jokes for every circumstance, but Collin Firth nearly steals the entire movie as Harry Hart which given his knack for playing serious roles, would come across strange but Firth is so wonderful as a cultured spy and it's so energizing and enjoyable to see Collin step out of his serious acting shoes and play a more vibrant character and rounding out the cast is the always wonderful Michael Cane as Arthur.I can't praise Kingsman enough, it's just a total blast to watch. Go watch it already!",10,1,2,2 September 2017
Jurassic Park," Life has found a way.
","In the summer of 1993 when Jurassic Park came out, I was keen on seeing it due to the movie being about dinosaurs but due to my young age, I wasn't able to watch it until it came out on VHS a year later and when I first watched it, I was left mesmerized and terrified by what I had seen. As I grew older and rewatched it more often, I began to see the movie in a different light and having recently rewatched it in preparation for Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the movie still holds after 25 years. From it's interesting premise and themes to its ground-breaking visual effects and incredible performances, Jurassic Park is a prime example of how to do a summer blockbuster right.The film opens on the island of Isla Nublar where a team is overseeing the delivery of a Velociraptor to be included in the new dinosaur theme park called Jurassic Park. However, the raptor is highly aggressive and kills one of the park employees. Following the accident, the park's investors demand that expect to visit the park in order to certify it as safe. They invite a chaos theorist named Ian Malcolm while the park's founder, John Hammond invites paleontologist Alan Grant and paleobotanist Ellie Sattler to endorse the park. Upon arriving on the island, the group is mesmerized when they see a Brachiosaurus and a group of Parasaurolophus. They are then taken to the visitors' center where they are shown a brief video explaining the process of cloning the dinosaurs which were done using fossilized mosquitos preserved in tree sap with the DNA of frogs added in. Grant, Sattler, and Malcolm all have serious doubts about the safety of the park and the ethical problems of having dinosaurs thrown into the 20th century and discuss it with Hammond but their words fall on deaf ears. The group is then joined by Hammond's grandkids for an afternoon tour of the park, however, the tour doesn't go as intended as the dinosaurs fail to appear. The tour is then cut short by a tropical storm during which a computer programmer named Denis Nedry, who has been paid off by a business rival of Hammonds to pilfer dinosaur embryos, shuts down the park's security system and escapes. With the power out, the tour vehicles stall next to the now insecure T-Rex paddock.Given Steven Spielberg's prowess in the film community and being the father of the summer blockbuster, It's not surprising that Jurassic Park is a cinematic sightpost for him as the audience is given a sense of wonder and dread few modern summer blockbusters can provide us with nowadays, so much so that the franchise has been be going strong for the last 25 years and shows no sigh of slowing down. On the outside, Jurassic Park may seem like a cross between Westworld and Frankenstein but if one looks under the outer layers they'll find a cautioning tale of the dangers of trying to control nature and the consequences of doing so. It's a modern reciting of Frankenstein's monster but rather than focusing on a misjudged individual, the characters are confronted by a zoo of prehistoric monsters. The themes of mankind's overreliance on technology and trying to control nature are nothing new in the world of entertainment as they're been used countless times but the way the movie handles these themes is so well done and never once do the morals of the film feel forced nor does the movie feel the need to beat the viewer over the head with it's message every 5 minutes unlike some other films. A prime example of this is how Michael Crichton always seems to take delight in certain themes in his novels and that is clearly visible in Jurassic Park as he and David Koepp reveal the movie as a captivating, frantically wide-ranging narrative on the capabilities as well as the follies of technology as well as mankind's attempts to control nature as perfectly shown by Dr. Ian Malcolm, who besides being the best character in the movie, he is not fooled by Hammond's park and remains suspicious of the lawless environment of this industrialized El Dorado when he goes on the tour and again comments on functional mathematics as an aid for demonstrating how flawless images have a way of falling once they deal with reality which sums up the themes of the movie so wonderfully without the need to hit the audience over the head and actually serves the plot of the movie well.In a sense, the plot of the film seems made-to-order for the genius of a director who can own most other directors in the world of filmmaking and storytelling by blending the suspense of Jaws with the newfangled morals of ET and Close Encounters of the Third Kind as well as the idea of coning the dinosaurs and you have a recipe for a fantastic movie. While a few crucial scenes in the film certainly equal the terror factor that Jaws had, the major contrast with Jurassic Park is that the dinosaurs walk all over the human characters both directly and allegorically while the characters are also believably sympathetic as well as charmingly unique as they all have a part to play in the movie to the point that they never feel like the typical cardboard cut-outs you see in so many modern blockbusters, but nevertheless the dinosaurs still rule Jurassic Park in every possible way. One of the issues with Crichton's novel is a failure to create engaging characters that the reader can identify with as the book is populated by an identical assortment of contemptuous, cold lingo-uttering nobodies and mustache-curling villains, it's near impossible to give a care about which characters live or die. Such is not the case in the movie as Spielberg and writer David Koepp have given each character enough development for the viewer to be invested in them and along they may not be the deepest or complex of movie characters, the characters of Jurassic Park are likeable, funny, and approachable unlike a film like Jurassic Park 3 or Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom where the characters are paper thin and feel more like cardboard cut-outs. Directing the dinosaur's rampages is one of Spielberg's specialties and a film viewer's dream come true. As the film progresses, it becomes more and more clear that Spielberg is a master of using terror and dread to the movie's advantage with every roar and shiver that hints at what is coming. A perfect example of this method is where Malcolm looks down at a T-Rex footprint and sees the water ripple and tremble to make for a truly bone-chilling scene. Steven also relishes the usage of creating iconic moments in the film such as an astounding scene where a pair of merciless velociraptors hunts Hammond's two grandkids through the visitor center's kitchen. Sure, any director can shoot an action scene or show us an epic battle between two armies but it takes a special kind of director like Spielberg to show us just how a few pots and pans can go flying at the thud of a velociraptor's tailor how the kids deceive their devious attackers simply by using an elusion to their advantage. In watching such a masterly done scene, it also helps to see the bigger picture and put things into the proper context. No other director could have been able to convince an audience that there are marauding dinosaurs in a kitchen the way Spielberg can, making the scene a high watermark for his career as a director and storyteller. But if the movie has a standout scene that demonstrates all of Steven's talents in front of and behind the camera, it would be the scene where the T-Rex investigates and pulverizes a Jeep with Hammond's two grandkids inside. It's easily one of the most intoxicating scenes ever put on film and is bleakly insightful along with being justly frightening regardless if you're 5 or 25. When it comes to the more violent and gory aspects of the movie, Spielberg tends to leave out a lot and allows the viewer to come up with their own conclusions. When it's time to actually show a death or blood in the movie, Steven cleverly bypasses the glaring carnage by getting a better shiver out of the audience by showing a goat or a cow being left near one of these hungry prehistoric beasts and quickly disappear. In order to make the velociraptors a more menacing introduction in the movie's opening scene, he begins the scene with a character whose upper body remains in focus while the rest of his torso is being dragged away off-screen much like what happened in Jaws. Such uneasy and horrendous achievements are linked by a simple story of survival as our heroes try to stay alive while avoiding the dinosaurs. In the hands of another director or writer, this would come across as cheap sentiment or forced emotional melodrama but with Spielberg, it never feels dumbed down anything for this movie and always aims for the highest standards of horror and thrills.Given Jurassic Park's impact on the filmmaking world in terms of pioneering computerized visual effects, it's not surprising that the movie blew audiences away the first time they saw the movie and the industry was changed forever as GCI was now a tool to be used and to be exploited. While CGI had been used before in The Abyss and Terminator 2, it had only in small doses and had never been used to show photorealistic visual effects, Jurassic Park changed all that. By using different kinds of effects for each dinosaur or scene to produce the best effect possible. Along with Denis Murren and his team at ILM and Phil Tippet's amazing stop-motion effects, the effects team were able to create dinosaurs that looked realistic rather than cartoonish or fake. The animatronics for the T-Rex, Brachiosaurus, and Triceratops look so life-like when they appear on-screen thanks to Stan Winston and his team who proved far more helpful to the finished movie than the CGI as their animatronics give the dinosaurs a level of believability that the CGI could never have done. Seeing the Triceratops on screen for the first time feels like a living, breathing animal while the raptor surprising Ellie makes them feel that much more threating and compe",10,1,1,31 July 2018
Evil Dead II," The prefect mix of horror and comedy.
","Now, I wasn't super-pumped about watching the first Evil Dead film, but it turned out to be pretty awesome thanks to it's atmosphere, Bruce Campbell, and it's usage of music, so by the time I watched Evil Dead 2, I was completely engrossed in this series and where it was going. As with the first film, Evil Dead II is a total blast from it's usage of comedy and scariness to Bruce Campbell and it's music.The movie kicks off with Ash Williams and his girlfriend, Linda going taking a trip to a supposedly vacant cabin in a forest. During their stay, Ash listens to a recording of the former resident, an archaeologist quoting segments from The Book of The Dead which awakens an malicious force that murders and then takes control of Linda who proceeds to attack Ash, compelling him to behead her and entomb her. Ash is then taken over by a demon, but when morning comes, the evil flees and Ash returns to normal and tries to leave but the only way out has been demolished. Meanwhile, the professor's daughter and her research colleague return with more pages from the book, only to discover that the bridge to the cabin is gone so they enroll the help of two locals who show them an alternative route, but once they arrive they find Ash battling the demons all while trying to keep his head straight, now the five of them must destroy the evil before it's too late.If The Evil Dead introduced us to the talents of Raimi and Campbell then this movie is the film that shows us the first one wasn't just some one-hit marvel and while the story of Evil Dead 2 is identical to the first one, the second one buries it's precursor in the dirt, it's better in every single area. As with the first movie, the low budget is clearly shown but it's the love of the craft from all the people that worked on this movie and who withstood unfavorable filming conditions and limited finances to give us something truly wonderful. Sam Raimi and the crew clearly had a objective to push the envelope of filmmaking as far as it would go without veering off a cliff; of course, the concept of people being trapped in a far-flung locale and being killed off one by one isn't that new of an idea given how the first Evil Dead movie invented it and has become a mainstay in horror films to this day, the way that it's filmed and written that makes this film such a classic.The violence of Evil Dead 2 is even more gruesome and bloody than it was in the first one with tons of be-headings, people getting stabbed with things, bodies being ripped in two, and lots of blood and goo everywhere and while it may seem incredibly disgusting, it's all done with a signature zany manner that makes all this gore a lot less winching and more hilarious like when a character is pulled into the cellar and a tsunami or blood comes pouring out.While the first one was more of a straight-on gore fest with some dark comedy thrown in, the sequel ups the ante when it comes to the humor like when Ash battles with his possessed hand which leads to something straight out of an episode of The Three Stooges with the hand repeatedly punching Ash, bashing plates on his head, and ending with Ash cuts his possessed hand off with a chainsaw making for one entertaining scene but the first half on the film then wraps up with one of the most hysterical moments I've ever seen on film in which parts of the inside of the cabin start to wiggle and clatter with evil vibes and in the space of a captivating minute, no more than 8 diverse laughing outbreaks, even Ash and the furniture, fill the place, this dreadfully tricky scene will certainly make the viewer feel a bit thrilled after it ends and even if the jokes scattered throughout the film fail to keep you howling with laughter rather than shrieking in horror, the movie's tiny budget will make sure that nothing will direct you to run out of the room screaming your head off.Having more money at their disposal, the visual effects look a lot better then the first one although by today's effects values, some people will find them laughably terrible, but in my honest opinion, the inventiveness that Sam and the crew put into the effects still looks wonderful today with a delightful mix of old-school make-up, masks, scary monsters, the usage of stop-motion, blue screen, and models which runs the complete range of practical effects needed to bring the world of the Evil Dead to life. The scene where Linda's headless corpse rises from her grave and then waltzes around is a perfect example of old stop-motion and while it does look a tad corny, it's still extremely creepy to watch, certainty better then the cheap CGI used in the Ring 2.When it comes to the actors in the movie, they all play their parts well but It's truly Bruce Campbell who makes the movie such a treat to watch. As with the first one, Bruce isn't playing the strong-armed hero or a super intelligent spy, but rather an normal guy who becomes a hardened bad-ass and goes into battle against the undead and yet completely steals the whole movie with spells of first-rate zaniness, insensitive weakness, over-the-top scene chewing, and irregular bravery, making him one of the coolest movie heroes ever to grace the big screen, the scenes of him battling the demons are pure cheese.Go see this movie at all costs, you will not regret it. It's gory, extremely quotable, and just down-right fun.",10,2,3,25 July 2017
