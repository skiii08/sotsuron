The Sound of Music," Read the book - the movie is hogwash.
","possible spoiler.I love old musicals, and I love the music in Sound of Music. And there's nothing wrong with the acting. But the movie is basically garbage. Maria Von Trapp wanted to sue the producers but found she had sold away this right. She loved the broadway play, but the movie completely distorted the facts of her life and her autobiography. Her husband was actually a gentle, loving father and husband, for starters. And the ending is a complete Hollywood fiction. The family actually left for America on a steamship with a contract for the family to tour the country giving performances. So much for dad Von Trapp despising singing. Christopher Plummer referred to it as 'The Sound of Treacle.' It's a great movie for children. But these adults who go gaga over it really should read Maria Von Trapp's autobiographies (in two volumes). The true story is much more interesting, and a much more inspiring testament to faith and fate.",4,25,63,23 November 2000
Seven Years in Tibet," A fictionalized historical drama
","Seven Years in Tibet is to the true story what the Sound of Music is to Maria Von Trapp's autobiography. Maria writes in the second volume of her autobiography that she wanted to sue the film makers, and I wonder whether Heinrich feels the same. I thought it was an excellent film that did a great job of conveying accurately what Lhasa looks like, having earlier seen a book of photographs from British expeditions around 1910. And I am glad it generated some sympathy for the plight of the Tibetans. But having since read Heinrich's autobiography, it appears that virtually every event in the movie was made up, including the business with the watch. I don't understand why, because the true story was fascinating, with lots of drama.  What is wrong with the minds and egos of people in Hollywood? If they want to completely distort the original facts, don't call it non-fiction.",6,122,155,23 November 2000
Titanic," Soon to be a major comic book.
","Annoying, cloying script. I don't think I could ever stomach seeing this movie again. The characters and script seem to have been based on a comic book. The cinematography is pretty good, though. Watch it with the sound off.",3,2,3,23 November 2000
