Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Change of heart
","I saw Star Wars Episode I for the last time on 12:01 Wednesday morning. I came out of the theater disappointed. I decided to go see it again from a different perspective - that of someone going to see the film on it's own merits, and not comparing it to the other three Star Wars films, and not from being the Star Wars fanatic that I am.After leaving the theater for the second time, I was very happy with the movie. I'm not sure why I was not happy with the movie the first time - the movie was not what I thought it was going to be. This is not a bad thing, just not what I expected.Not to say there were parts of the movie I did not like. I still wish Darth Maul would have been in the movie for more than 15 minutes, and that Jar Jar Binks would have been thrown in a meat grinder, but overall, the second time is a charm.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A good movie, but not great
","After 16 years of waiting, I must admit (and I don't like to) that I was disappointed. But I think my expectations were not only too high, but my idea of what the movie was like was far different than what it turned out to be.Good Points Darth Maul (all 15 minutes he is actually shown) Lightsabers - every time the Jedi pulled them out, it was a good scene Scenery and special effects were fantasticCriticisms Jar Jar Binks - WAY too much of this guy. For me, he ruined the atmosphere. He was there for comic relief. Humor - while in Episodes 4,5, and 6, the humorous moments seemed natural and genuine, in Episode 1, they seemed forced. Too much slapstick. Stereotypical characters - it seemed every alien had a human like accent. The Trade Federation sounded Asian, the race of whatever they were (Jar Jar's race) sounded Jamaican, and the blue flying thing that owned Anakin sounded a little Italian",7,0,1,19 May 1999
