The Rock," How did a wimpy geek like Nick Cage get invited to this party?
","Sean Connery must have the patience of Job. He has spent 30 years in isolation on account of secrets he knows and skills he possesses. He has even successfully escaped from Alcatraz...something that general knowledge states could not be done. After all of this, the ones who have screwed him around turn out to be the ones who need him most when the island is taken over by dis-gruntled soldiers and a past General of the Viet Nam war who have taken 81 hostages. Nick Cage is called in as a chem-weapons expert. He knows that field, but knows little else, as he has never seen combat, and it has been years since he had any weapons training. There's no problem for an audience to adjust their radar to see Connery in a cloak and dagger situation...and one that has high energy. But...with Nick Cage..he seems to be cast some what over his head and out of his element. There is some measure of a modern day 'Horatio Alger' character to his performance, but to my view the film could have been made without him, or his role could have been reduced. He actually bogs things down because he needs to be rescued a bit too often. And Cage is not the only problem with this film. The twists and turns of this plot defy reality at some points. There are a few entertaining and exciting moments in the film, but these are outweighed by the gaps in credibility of the plot and of some of the characters, especially the General who changes co-ordinates on a weapon of destruction, and claims he was only bluffing, and tries to call off the whole incident. Of course, the people that he has recruited are PO'd to a fare-thee-well. But, plot dysfunctions such as this take the steam out of the sails of the film, and it's hard to take the film seriously. That would be enough to chase off the critical thinkers, but not enough to turn off the thrill-seekers who want to be entertained...and that's probably the only reason this piece of celluloid has any legs at all. Because the film has mostly entertainment value of a destructive sort and does not seek to engage the audience, it fails to deliver. I have given it 5 stars, which I consider to be quite generous. I cannot recommend it, and I would not care to watch it again.",5,2,4,8 August 2010
Scarface," Good...but not Great....
","This is a good film...not a great one. Pacino always delivers, but he does not out-do what he gave us in 'Godfather II' or 'Dog Day Afternoon', or even 'Carlito's Way'. The violence is graphic, the language unbearable, but the characters are predictable. There are a few terrific performances aside from Pacino...a 'pre-Amadeus' F. Murray Abraham delivers well as the ill-fated Omar Suarez, Miriam Colon steals the scene from Pacino as the Mama filled with pride, and angry as she sees her son's descent into the nether-world of drugs and crime. It's what I wish Beryl Mercer would have said and done with Cagney in The 'Public Enemy'. This film is a difficult watch because it travels forth in almost real-time, and if you miss a little...you miss a lot. It is not for kids. Also, while the film was dedicated to Hawks and Hecht, I don't think the contribution of Seton I. Miller to the original screen-play should be overlooked. Miller had more screen plays to his credit that showcased hard boiled prison criminals than did Hecht, and no doubt Miller made the 1932 film sizzle as it did.",6,0,2,24 June 2011
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," And I Thought I Knew What Crazy Was !!!!!
","Borat is complete insanity. It is intensely funny by way of the appearance of crudity...not of polish. He is an un-sophisticated, backwards character who means well, but always manages to screw things up just the same. The policy of the comedy is essentially 'no holds barred...nothing is sacred...and no one is safe or immune'. He exposes prejudices, phobias, racial attitudes, sexist attitudes...he just brings it all out into the open while you stare at the screen in utter dis-belief at what you have just seen, heard, or experienced. It is all cleverly orchestrated by Sasha Baron Cohen and his co-horts, and many a public figure has been suckered into falling for his gags and his persona. The movie...even the DVD...looks homemade, and the look is the look of film from the 60s or 70s...but the comedy is current, up to date, and you will need to fasten your seat belt...it's all funny and all fun, but it's bound to make people uncomfortable, and the secret is...that's exactly what the creator of Borat set out to do. The hand of Jay Roach, director of the Austin Powers trilogy, can be felt here and there in the production. Not for the feint of heart or the easily offended. But if you're a gambler, give Borat a try. It's guaranteed to offend and entertain.",7,0,1,16 August 2010
Meet the Parents," Hard to warm up to it.....
","Frankly, I did not find the film to be very funny or entertaining. It seems that the measure of a film now-a-days is not how much it entertains, but how well it does at the box office. Some pretty lousy films have done well with ticket sales, while some other films have had something to say, but have fallen short of the dollar mark. This was an OK film, but not one that I would call a 'must see' movie. And then, for it to spawn a sequel is beyond all belief. I tried to give the movie a fair watching--after all, I assumed that with De Niro on the screen there would be much there to watch--but I kept finding myself mouthing off the words of the kids in the back seat of the van ...' are we there yet??' De Niro has a broad spectrum, a big range for his acting talents. But he is an extraordinary actor who, it seems, falls flat on his face when he is not cast as an extraordinary character. It was awfully big of him to take the role of the father, but it felt more like casting Humphrey Bogart as an extra. And as for Ben Stiller...he still has a ways to go to establish a screen persona. His character was somewhat nebulous...though he did well at defining how vulnerable the character was. Comparing Stiller to De Niro, or even to his father, Jerry, is something of an unfair comparison, but he has yet to come up with that defining character or characteristic. The situations are stretched somewhat out of proportion, and Jay Roach's direction works far better with Mike Myers, where reckless abandon of plot and characters are the rule and not the exception. Based on what I saw in this film, I am in no hurry to see 'The Fockers'. I only recommend this film if you have nothing better to do.",5,5,10,1 July 2010
Chicken Run," Did NOT enjoy it....
","As stop action animation goes, 'Chicken Run' was something of a letdown. The characters needed more development, the story line was somewhat predictable, and it did not flow very smoothly. I watched it during a marathon viewing of old VHS tapes I ran across, and it pales in comparison to the classic Disney works, Don Bluth, and others. Plus, it had traces of 'Animal Farm' scattered throughout the story and, indeed, in the final frames, there are characters who make mention of starting a 'chicken farm'. I did not find it very entertaining or even engaging. It was a difficult watch...and, after only one viewing, I easily determined I would NOT want to watch it again.",4,2,5,1 April 2010
Romeo + Juliet," Worse than 'Plan 9 From Outer Space'....
","I understand the basic motive of the producers of this thing-a-ma-bob, based on the work of Shakespeare, who based his upon other works of the period. It was a grand effort, but it fails miserably. To update this classic story to modern, hip-hop times and still keep the Elizabethan English in the script is a sort of a death warrant in and of itself. It is clumsy, corny, and a bit superfluous. It stumbles over its own two left feet. I suffered through one viewing of it, praying that it would soon be over. After what felt like an eternity, it finally was over. I would never want to sit through this movie again. It lacked character, substance, and credibility. Plus, there is a great deal of otherwise terrific talent wasted along the way. Brian Dennehy and Paul Sorvino would be worth the price of admission alone, were it another, more credible vehicle. But they come off looking like fools in this play in search of an identity for itself. Leonardo does the best he can to make this thing work, but...terrific actor that he is...he simply does not have the depth to pull this one off. The direction was fast paced and intense, and that was one of the problems with it. The actors had no real opportunity to let the characters come to life and to allow the script to breathe. The result...it moves at too quick a pace, it never quite settles in, and the actors sound as if they are reciting their lines, as opposed to allowing the lines to be delivered at a credible, believable pace. The modernization of the story is also a sore point. To bring this story into the age of greed and moral degradation tends to over shadow the point...that this is a story of love and of just plain rivalry between two families that do not see eye to eye. Romeo and Juliet pay the price for the foolish attitudes of their families, a situation that rings as clear to-day as it did way back in the days of old. The producers wanted to take the story a step beyond 'West Side Story', which was also a variation on the Romeo/Juliet tragedy...but it failed in this modern day translation. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' was badly done because it had virtually no budget, and dealt with the death of a principal cast member during filming. This one had the budget, but it was still badly done, badly written, and badly executed. Maybe another production company will undertake the mantle and do a more respectable job.",3,1,1,12 September 2010
Meet Joe Black," Could Have Been Better....
","This movie, an up-dated version of the classic film 'Death Takes A Holiday' from the 30s, which starred Fredric March, is devoid of any real philosophical or moral qualities. It is filmed, or so it appears, purely for the entertainment value. That, in itself, is not bad, but because of the lack of true focus and insight on the part of the director, the film suffers tremendously. Here, Brad Pitt plays the part of 'Death'...but, really, at this point of time in cinematic history, no one is afraid of him. Not really. And though Pitt is an excellent actor, he is not able to pull off an authoritative performance, one that demands fear from those he encounters because of Death's cold finality, and because of the ensuing questions as to the afterlife and what one's fate could possibly be in that afterlife. I would not expect the director to give us a 'shot-by-shot' repeat of the original...as did some unfortunate director who gave us a needless play-by-play of 'Psycho' some years back...but there were opportunities that were missed to make this a film above the cut. And any film with Anthony Hopkins has that possibility. Talent is wasted in this one, as are opportunities to make the picture rise above the fray by mere virtue of situational possibilities that could have gone in virtually any direction...but which failed to do so. First, I feel it was a mistake to make the main character one who has lived a fairly charmed and privileged life, who does not struggle with moral and philosophical issues on a 'hand to mouth' basis daily. Where is the redemptive value in inspecting the life of someone who flies into Manhattan in his own helicopter to a private helipad, to go to his office in the midst of Wall Street to a board meeting on the top floors of some corporate structure to a meeting with his board of directors? I don't see much --if any-- redemptive value there. Second, it seems that a role reversal might have served this movie well. Brad Pitt--at this time--did not have the authoritative presence that such a terrifying spectre as death should possess. People are very much afraid of death...the fear of the unknown. But clearly, the presence of death in non-threatening form is incredible waste, and its meaning is lost on both the performers and the audience if it fails to score and make its deadly presence known and felt. This was a true failing. Hopkins could have done this, and, indeed, he has done it before...Hannibal Lector is one of the classic movie villains, and Hopkins gave Lector that life and presence. One of the missed opportunities was witnessed in the boardroom when Drew--a very arrogant character--demanded to know just who Joe Black was and why he seemed to have a strangle-hold on Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish. The way the scene was handled, without giving away the identity and purpose of Joe Black was, at that critical moment, a big letdown...almost an act of cinematic cowardice on the part of the director. It really took the steam out of the sails. Plus...that character needed to be brought down a few notches, and Death would have been the ideal one to accomplish this...but it never really happened to my satisfaction. It was one of the most dis-appointing moments of the movie, a real low. This movie had the potential to be something far more than what it wound up being. Maybe someone might try it again, and there may be something of a more fluid flow of ideas...but the writers got stuck in the mud...the direction was wooden, stoic, not multi-directional and all encompassing. Because of this, the film implodes under the weight of its own imperfections. I really wanted to like this movie..and I expected more. I cannot recommend it very highly...and I would advise a watching of the Fredric March version to get a real feel of what is going on before you tread the murky waters of 'Meet Joe Black'.",5,1,3,22 July 2010
Pocahontas," Not as bad as I expected....
","Disney films such as 'The Hunchback' and 'Pocahontas' are films I did not want to watch because I already knew--or at least sensed--that the historical context was going to be bent somewhat out of shape. I have not yet seen the Hunchback, but Pocahontas is an attempt to put a new suit of clothes on an old story. An attempt was made by the writers to at least put on the table the differing points of view of the arrival of Whites from both perspectives...the conqueror and the soon to be vanquished. Though conflict in this instance was averted, the Natives were going to ultimately be the big losers and, as if that weren't enough, within several years of the date of this story--1607--Jamestown would become the point of entry for African slaves, brought over as cargo to till the soil and build the new land under the rule of cat-o-nine-tails. But, Pocahontas deals with only a small fraction of time. Despite my mis-givings, I have to say the story-line was not overly bad, and I was amazed at the excellent quality of the film score. However, one cannot help but feel sorry for the Natives because, with the invaders cast as guys that were not all that bad, the indigenous peoples have a hand in bringing about their own downfall by accepting those who had lust for the land and for its riches without regard to the lives and well being of those who were already on the land and who had been there for millenia. If one is able to get past the facts, they may be able to get some enjoyment from this film. And I can only recommend this film to those who can cast aside their feelings for a time in order to watch it.",5,0,1,8 May 2010
Goodfellas," You gotta see it.....
","When 'Goodfellas' was in theatrical release, I did not see it. I was having a fit of 'cinematic malaise'...there simply were not a whole heck of a lot of good flicks coming out during that time, and the slew of street thug movies actually made it somewhat dangerous to venture out into theaters in some cities. A lot of us said 'to hell with it' and decided to concentrate on our own VHS collections and catch up on films when they became available for rent or purchase. Consequently, I did not see 'Goodfellas' until 1999. I'd heard about the film, and I must say my own legs were not long enough to kick myself in the rear for waiting so long to see it. And this was just one of the films I had to catch up with...there were a number of others. I did not think that this film could top most of the other mob-type films that had already been made. I was wrong. The film was engrossing form the outset. Joe Pesci was loud and scary...and Paul Sorvino was relatively quiet and scary...in a way that was more menacing and perhaps more disturbing than Pesci...which was acting that took quite a bit of doing. I was rather roughed up at some of the language and the racial references...it took me a while to reconcile this...they were products of the times. One thing that caught my eye--and ear--was that Scorsese kept the imagery in a kind of 1960s mode. No long sideburns or long haircuts. No dog-eared shirts...no wide neck-ties or lapels. This hurt the film from a standpoint of making it flow with time...but the performances and the characters help to overcome this.The story is very well told, and Scorsese does it masterfully. One can see that he had a direct influence on Tarantino, especially when the film opens with the murder of a 'made man' in the mob...a story that we return to much later in the film. Tarantino borrowed that style and essentially made it his own. Pesci re-defined the definition of a madman in a screen performance of a character who did not live to the end of the film...but yet will not die. Sorvinos broad range has seen him playing such diverse characters as Bible-thumping fundamentalist ministers...even a rape victim. But his stature as a tough guy is secure...one glance from those steely eyes can penetrate the audience, and you can see Perdition itself through it all. Bob De Niro plays, of all things, a character who is only half-Italian, which would dis-qualify him from becoming a 'made man' for the mob no matter what he does. His, too, is a very broad spectrum. I have a few reservations about recommending the film 100%. It is very realistic, very graphic and very violent. But, seldom is the truth a very pretty thing to look at. See Goodfellas...if you haven;t already. If you have...see it again. It is part of my collection now.",9,0,0,30 July 2010
