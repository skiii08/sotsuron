Sucker Punch," Chicks, guns, explosions and warriors... Well, it sounded good...
","There is no denying that Zack Snyder is a very visionary director. If anyone has seen his graphic novel styled movies 300 and Watchmen, it's clear to see where his profession is. To dazzle the eyes of his viewers which he does incredibly well every time. But his story telling is where things begin to flop. Yes, the visuals in Sucker Punch are amazing. We have sword wielding, guns blasting, explosions going off, great big fire breathing dragons, planes in the sky, battlefields, chicks slaying stuff everywhere, but do I see a story anywhere? Beyond all that marvellous CGI, surely there must be a story? No, there isn't. Even the makers of this film got lost in the wonders of the pointless action that kept getting rammed down our throats to a point where it just became BORING. Sure, seeing chicks smash crap up and slay bad guys is fun at first, but after a while it gets to repetitive that gets you asking: 'Okay, can we see some story now?'Sucker Punch revolves around the character Babydoll, who accidentally shoots and kills her sister when in self defence of her abusive step father. She is sent to a mental institution for girls, where she is joined by her 'comrades' Sweet Pea, Amber, Blondie, and Rocket. Although the place is meant to be a mental institution, it seems more like a strip club the way the girls are treated by the man who runs the place. The acting of the five girls are very bland, all the lines are said with no emotion and they all just seem very wooden acted and two dimensional. Sure, they pull it off in the battles and action scenes, because all they have to do is scream and shoot things and blow things up which, let's be honest, even the worst actors can do. Even Emily Browning, who did a great role in A Series of Unfortunate Events, was sadly a disappointment in this.Now, Babydoll has no intention of staying in the institution. She dreams up a pretend world filled with dragons and warriors and Nazi zombies, where she is told she has to collect four items so she can escape the institution. Seeing as all the action takes place in their crazy messed up heads, I can't see how any of it matters to us. Sure, seeing Emily Browning battle three massive Samurai Warriors is fun and exciting at first, but then we drift further and further from the real world and more into this dream world that a ten year old would create if he was bored in math class. We've all been there.Yes, all the girls are insane, why else would they imagine all the battle sequences that happen so repeatedly? But Sucker Punch, believe it or not, started out promising, for about 10 minutes. It had to potential to actually be a good movie, but the more and more action sequences and CGI they throw into one scene, the storyline just gets thinner and thinner and eventually disappears where we don't care what happens to the characters anymore. Sucker Punch will, without doubt, dazzle you with its visuals and mindless action. It could be fun with a bunch of mates, if all you want to see is chicks and robots and dragons with some booze. But if you're after a serious story with well developed characters and a storyline that stays strong all the way through, then I'd give it a miss.CGI sequences= Stunning, 10/10Story and characters= 3/10",5,0,2,17 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Not So Amazing Spider Man
","As a long time fan of the Spider Man movies and comic books alike, I was eagerly awaiting to see this reboot. I had high hopes for the film as being a fan of Marc Webb's work also. I was sure that the film was in good hands. So as I sat in the cinema with my buddies waiting for the film to begin, I was expecting a reboot to show us more about Peter's parents and a better back story. And boy, was I disappointed. The Sam Raimi films had fantastic action, humour, heart and soul, which this film showed a great lack off. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was! What we get out of this movie is barely any action and A lot of romance, Parker constantly unmasking himself (I thought the whole point of Spider Mans secret identity was to, I don't know, KEEP IT A SECRET?) We had the Lizard, which had to be the most disappointing villain in super hero movie history, and the fact that it didn't follow much from the comic books at all. The casting was alright enough, Emma Stone made a decent enough Gwen Stacey, and I hope that she will break into her character more in the sequels. Andrew Garfield didn't suit Spider Man at all. He didn't look nerdy like Toby Maguire did in the originals and I didn't really see him portray the character as he should have done. Plus, Peter Parker never used to skateboard, did he? No, I didn't think so. Sally Field as Aunt May didn't work at all, and Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben actually turned out okay... Even though he was in 3 scenes total... The trio of Toby, Kirsten and James made a better cast then this lot. Plus, the lack of Harry and J Jonah Jameson was defiantly missed.Now, back when I mentioned that the Raimi trilogy had heart and soul, it was a shock to see that this film had very little of it. When Uncle Ben died in the 2002 movie, it was a really sad scene, because you actually cared about him, and it tugged our heart strings (or at least mine) to see Uncle Ben die. And that Peter showed genuine sadness and heart ache after Uncle Ben's death. With this, Uncle Ben is killed and it's sad for all about two minutes. Peter showed no sadness or emotion after his Uncles death, and the goodbye scene as Peter watches him die just seems awkward and the two didn't really connect all that well. The Lizard however, seemed like a suitable villain to start this re- booted series of. The Lizard is an interesting character, and this movie could have handled it really well, except it didn't. The Lizard looked like a Godzilla rip off and there seemed to be no humanity in the character at all. Shouldn't it have shown a tormented Dr. Curt Conner's as he is going through these changes? And after the big fight at the end, the Lizards story is quickly wrapped up by a news report saying he was arrested. Now, in the end of every Sam Raimi Spider Man, there was humanity in each of the villains before they died/ or left. The Green Goblin showed his human side to Peter when they were both unmasked, right before his glider impaled him; Doc Ock showed that he still had goodness in him by sacrificing himself to save the city; and also, Sandman even had a moment with Peter that showed his still had goodness in him. The Lizard? Oh no, they just made him a ridiculous dinosaur for Spider Man to fight and defeat. Also, why the hell did they make Gwen Stacey know Peter is Spider Man in this film? Gwen Stacey NEVER knew who Spider Man was in the comics, as she blamed Spider Man for the death of her father. With this movie they screwed all that up and made Gwen a more ballsy character than she should have been. And why were there so many spiders??? There was meant to be ONE special spider that bites Peter, not God knows how many that were shown. Plus, I'm pretty sure if you get shot in the leg you CANT keep running.The only redeeming factor in this movie was Spider Man had a great sense of humour, and the web slinging scenes (beside the last one) were also well done. Not a fan of the new suit though. In summary, The Amazing Spider Man was a big disappointment. I'm still standing by the Raimi originals, and I hope that they make an improvement with The Amazing Spider Man 2.",4,5,11,16 August 2012
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Scott Pilgrim VS my review...
","Scott Pilgrim VS The World, based off the Oni Press graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O Malley, has had a mix of opinions. Some people love it; however, other people completely hate it. When I first watched it, I didn't view it with a critical mind, so my verdict on it was that it was awesome. Having watched it again with a critical mind, I'm starting to think: Was it really that awesome? The graphic novels were great, but the 6 books had so much in them, character wise and story wise that seemed way too much to pack into one film. But, with the bad points in the film, it has its up sides. Edgar Wright did a great job at staying true to the source material. A lot of the scenes in the movie looked just like they did in the books, and the comic effects that came on screen made us feel like we were watching a moving graphic novel. The casting also helped a lot also, as most all the actors looked very similar to the comic's characters. Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winsted defiantly suited the roles, especially Jason Schwartzman, who made a great Gideon. Another good thing was that it had the same quirky humour that the books had, and I found myself laughing at what was funny in the graphic novels. But the films flaws are what brings it down from being as good as the books. The thing with the 6 books was, it had A lot going on. There's a lot of characters' that have their own back-stories, ranging from the evil ex-boyfriends to Scott's fellow band members and friends, and I felt that pretty much none of them were explored enough in this film.The whole back story between Scott and Kim was briefly mentioned but not fully explored; the Envy Adams story was also brought up, but only left us asking what happened between them in the first place? The ex boyfriends had very little screen time each, and although that is the case in the books, at least the books explained a little more about them. Mathew Patel had his story explained, but then we are given the same cheesy singing scene that was one of the first books low points. The Twins were completely wasted due to neither of them having any lines to say, and there was no real confrontation between Ramona and Todd and how Todd is, basically, a cheating scumbag. The relationship between Scott and Ramona didn't work at all. It took 6 books to develop the love story and the conflicts between them, but, like a lot of other factors in this film, that part seemed rushed through also. Ramona had the same habit she had in the books, she was quite the confusing character whose personality goes from annoying to very annoying after some time. I didn't buy the romance between Scott and Ramona either, and even towards the end when it's all over, I still don't see how they manage to make the relationship work together. Everything seemed to be summed up within a few minutes that leaves us asking things like: 'Wait, what happened between those two?' or 'Well that got summed up a bit quick' or even 'They have TOTALLY missed that part out!'. Understandable, movies can go down a different route from their source material, but this movie tried to fit everything in that resulted in it being quite a mess of a film. And Ramona had the same habit she had in the books: She was quite the confusing character whose personality go very annoying after some time. Whereas the films CGI was often quite decent, some fighting scenes were a little glitchy. I'm not too sure if that was their intention to make fight scenes glitchy like a video game, but I don't think the whole video game effect appealed to me. Another thing that I'm unsure of is, are these characters' actually in a video game? The lives, the fighting and the sound effects, is it set in the real world or an actual video game world? Whereas in the books Bryan managed to get away with it, for a film it doesn't work all that well. The verdict is, Scott Pilgrim VS the World is an enjoyable film if you don't pay too much attention to details. However if its details and a proper structured story you are after, I doubt that you will enjoy it.",6,1,2,22 August 2012
