Walk the Line," One of the best I've seen in years
","I cannot say enough about this movie! While watching Joaquin Phoenix play this role, you forget that it's him. He really becomes the character with such amazing skill. His singing gave me chills - you really can't believe it's him and not a dub of Johnny Cash. His range is astounding, being able to go from high to the really low notes Cash is so famous for - without breaking or sounding sour. You walk out of the movie knowing that he's the Oscar winner this year - there can be no question. And Reese... that girl just continues to build herself in my eyes as one of the great actresses of our time. For those who think all she's good for is eye candy or a romantic comedy, you are dead wrong. And in my opinion, her singing was even better than the woman she portrayed. This was an explosive relationship, and the two of them pulled it off perfectly.",10,2,4,5 December 2005
