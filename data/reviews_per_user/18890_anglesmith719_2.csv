Men in Black 3," I loved it
","The review really tries to drive home the suspense for the secrets and well they should! This is the best movie in the trilogy. It might be a little wordier then the other two, but everyone in my office at DISH agrees that it was necessary. This is the movie that ties up all the loose ends left in its predecessors. And to top it off it was hilarious enough to leave the wife, kids, and even myself laughing all Friday night. When we were using the Redbox, which only has a handful of movies, it was always a challenge to find something for the entire family. But now that we have over 100,000 different selections through Blockbuster @Home from DISH, I have not seen one person disappointed face on a movie night in months.",9,0,2,14 December 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man Is Truly Amazing!
","The newest adaptation of the Spider-Man story, although a bit early, is arguably the best one yet. The guys in my office at DISH think that was due to the fact that the script stays a lot closer to the original Spider-Man comics plot, but I think it was because we were giving more information about the disappearance of Peter's parents. Also the writers made a bold move to have Peter spend more time in high school and I am positive that that is going to pay off in the long run. I never have time to stop at the Redbox down the street to grab movies, but since I started renting from Blockbuster at Home through DISH the discs are already waiting in my mailbox when I get off work and this was an awesome first choice.",Null,3,6,24 November 2012
