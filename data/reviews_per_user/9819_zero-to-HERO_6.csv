Blade Runner 2049," Blade Runner 2049: A Sci-Fi Sequel With A Lot Of Character!
","The year is 2049 and the replicants are wiser and more lifelike than ever before. Let's begin with the cast which was nothing short of a perfect selection process. 'K' played by Ryan Gosling played the perfect replicant/detective aka a Blade Runner in what seemingly looked to be a futuristic post apocalyptic world full of Nomad-like characters, both on the Replicant & Human side. A very complex character to fill that seemed more human than replicant. To be blunt, Ryan's performance was basically a home run - end of story there. His superior, Lieutenant Joshie played by Robin Wright, took me a short while to get accustomed too for that role but it didn't take long for me to realize that she was terrific for the part. As for Jared Leto who plays Niander Wallace, the proud new owner of Tyrell Corp, let's just say he did a far better role playing Niander, than he did as The Joker in Suicide Squad. I found he had more depth as Niander and although he portrayed a different kind of dark character (than when he played Joker), he was able to pull off this role quite nicely. Which brings me to Niander's primary trusted henchman, in this case woman, and going by the name of Luv, played by Sylvia Hoek, really made you love to hate this character. At first I felt a tiny bit of sympathy for her but as the movie progressed that sympathy turned to hate - in a positive manner. Simply because she played the part meticulously, especially for the type of replicant she was suppose to portray. And speaking of sidekicks Ana de Armas who plays Joi, a new type of tech or hologram that was more of a friend/love interest to Ryan Goslings character 'K' - as weird as that sounds. The two worked very well together and Ana's performance was nothing short of spectacular. Most movies I find overuse CGI unnecessarily, and even for the caliber of a sci-fi movie that this was supposed to be, you'd think it might be overdone, yet somehow this movie used CGI exactly where it was needed. That been said the scenery and cinematography was done just right, it mimicked the same world from the original Blade Runner with a right amount of modernization to make you think this is what the world would look like roughly thirty years later. The only negatives I found in this film is I found it dragged just a little bit, and the sound/score was a little too overdone. Otherwise overall the good by far outshines the bad. This was a solid sci-fi flick that had a lot of elements. From having a futuristic detective feel to it, to an appropriate amount of action, to a zestful of character, to even making you second guess some issues in regards to moral factors. This film had everything it needed and more to not only be a very likable film, but a total win as a sequel.",9,4,13,7 October 2017
Aquaman," AQUAMAN & WONDER WOMAN SAVE THE DCEU!
","It looks as though the DCEU has some hope! Between the success Wonder Woman had and now Aquaman, there is some light at the end of the tunnel after all. The DCEU now has room to restructure their semi folly flicks/runs via the Justice League & Suicide Squad. Or does it? The reason why I say this is that it looks as though the DCEU movieverse does better with their standalone character driven films than it does when they're relayed as a team. Perhaps it was a matter of bad timing. I humbly think they should have introduced their primary standalone character films first before rushing in team collaborated feature films. Trying to catch up with marvel seemed to have been the plan, the folly there was marvel has been good at their movieverse craft for quite some time now. DC should have just paced themselves one character at a time.But enough of the loom and gloom, this was supposed to be a positive review and thus it shall be. To be frank I didn't expect the film to be as good as it was. And admittedly had my doubts and reservations. Don't get me wrong I thought it was going to be fun but fun in a goofy way (not that I was expecting the whole thing to be goofy, just more so than not). But to my surprise there was less goofiness and more straight up fun. Not only that, but there were dark yet mystical elements to the film as well, supplemented with a dash of wittiness and character. Albeit the style that was presented in this film wasn't over the top, nor was it lowly either, but in my humble opinion, done just right (from a comic book world perspective). From the telling tale of Arthur Curry (Aquaman) to the general creation and lore of the world around him, I really didn't want it to end and yearned for more. And it made me feel like that slightly more so than when I watched Wonder Woman (as much as I also greatly appreciated that film).Now it's no secret that to portray Atlantis properly, there would have to be some heavy CGI. And I will say it was done just right - considering current CGI technologies (plus budget allowance). The architecture presented both modern Atlantis and old sectors as well. To describe the way it was done would be harder said than seen. The rich textures and lush colors at so many turns, let alone the style of structures utilized created a mythical magic about Atlantis unlike seen before, part of which included Atlantean technological advancements. Of course I did see some areas that I thought needed more attention to detail, but my overall admiration of what was presented far outweighed my nitpickiness. The only real way to describe what Atlantis is like in this movie is to go see it yourself.The actors did an admirable job! As someone who reads Aquaman comics, I had a tough time seeing Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Let's face it, Arthur from the comics and Arthur in this film look very different. And although I've been a fan of Jason Momoa's roles in both Stargate Atlantis (no pun intended) and Game of Thrones - I just couldn't visualize Jason hitting the mark as Aquaman. And to my surprise he did just that, especially as a DCEU extension of the character, he did a fantastic job! Just as Arthur, Jason delivered a bold, conflicted and sometimes misunderstood Aquaman, whilst showing us a prideful 'not easy to uncover' loving side as well.The supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do & quite the impressive cast it was. Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Willem Dafoe as Nuidis Vulko, Amber Heard as Mera, and even Dolph Lungren as King Nereus and more... Sometimes it's not the actors alone who make or break a film no matter who the actor/actress is, oftentimes it's the synergy of how the characters coalesce to one another that's an integral part of the process. Hence is why I reiterate this supporting cast was solid enough to do what they had to do and delivered a successful Aquaman film.I must admit, when I see non comic book readers critique a comic book film, it makes me cringe (not always but a fair amount of times). Which is why in my humble opinion when seeing a Superhero film, don't rely on such critics too much, and sometimes this includes comic book reader critics too. Go in with an open mind and judge for yourself the world that's being presented to you. A comic book movieverse is one of those rare exceptions where relying on your own critiquing is a much better way of validating your liking or disliking of any one of these films over other critics themselves.As for me, I really relished this film. It had all the elements required to portray Aquaman and the world around him. From the storytelling and the lore presented to the characters themselves and the laid out visuals. Go see it, and lean on your own genuine open minded critiquing when you do see it.",9,15,32,4 January 2019
Suicide Squad," Be careful Reading Reviews From Non Comic Book Readers. Suicide Squad Is a Prime Example!
","Like with so many Superhero setting movies, I've noticed that there is a fair amount of supposed critics that rate these movies knowing nothing about the comic origins, including some of the canons of these great Characters. I wish these same critics would stop rating Superhero movies because they are giving it an unfair review with their murky at best knowledge (and I'm sure not all fall in this bracket but a fair amount do). I'd rather listen to comic reader's points of view when it comes to Superheroes and Supervillains coming to the big screen. That been said I'm not saying if you don't read comics and graphic novels not to go see these movies, all I'm trying to relay is if your reading reviews, try to focus from people who know these worlds and these characters over people who review almost everything just for the sake of conforming with current movie trends.And onto my quick burst review: As a comic reader myself I've decided to separate the Characters in the Suicide Squad from 'A' rated Superheroes/ Supervillains. You've got to remember that the characters in Suicide Squad are 'B' rated Characters (sometimes even 'C' rated). If you could do that then you will enjoy the movie more. For me it was a terrific ride full of action, a bit of comedy, and with a decent Character background story.The scenery was dark yet luminous which was perfect for this type of movie. All the actors and actresses played their parts quite nicely. From Killer Croc (played by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) to Captain Boomerang (played by Jai Courtney), and El Diablo (played by Jay Hernandez). The Enchantress/Witch was supposed to be creepy and mysterious and Cara Delevingne delivered just that! And best of all were Will Smith as Deadshot and Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. You feel for Deadshot because you see what makes him tick and his background story bridges a bit of emotion with captivating intrigue. When it came to Harley Quinn, I didn't see how the Suicide Squad team could have valued anything from Harley Quinn's abilities (but of course they found a way to mix her in with the team). This I base on the type of mission the cast was given to undergo in this movie (I don't want to give any spoilers so you'll have to see the movie to see what I mean). That been said how Margot Robbie portrayed Harley Quinn as the actual standalone Character was done close to perfection! And as a Harley Quinn fan that was good enough for me!I found myself with conflicting viewpoints with Jarod Leto's rendition of the Joker. It almost felt like he tried to mimic and/or add Heath Ledger's Jokers antics into his Joker - for me a tattoo punk/gangster looking Joker to use those Characteristics (if that was the case) didn't really work for me. I can't really say that he was a poor adaptation of the Joker either, but I will say there was a lot of room for improvement - in correlation to the style and type of this Joker they tried to portray in this flick.Final verdict: As mentioned at the beginning of this review, the key point here is if you can recognize that these zany misfits called the Suicide Squad are not classified as 'A' list status Superheroes and should not be compared to them, then it's quite probable that you will enjoy this film, and to be fair that's how this movie should be looked at/reviewed. Would I recommend this movie? Yes I would, especially if you go into the movie not expecting empyrean like Superhero statuses. And finally, I would like to stress that if they decide to develop another installment of Suicide Squad that it really should be an R- rated film. Then it would truly be Suicide Squad personified.",6,1,2,5 August 2016
Baby Driver," A Bracing Thrill Ride!
","Yes it was a heist plotted movie, that's no secret - but what separates this movie from some other heist flicks is it actually has an equal amount of character as it does action. I'm quite good at spotting predictable moments but this movie didn't have many of those (if any), which was nice for a change. In short, basically it was like Fast & The Furious, except it was good!",10,12,21,18 July 2017
Justice League," The Expectations Were Zero, But It Turns Out It Was A HERO of Superhero Film After All!
","Although I am quite the DC fan, I will admit that I didn't have high hopes & was expecting to give this film a 6/10 (tops). But overall I now give it a solid 7.5/10. Storyline/writing was fair, CGI looked complex but was integrated nicely (considering this type of movie is highly meant to be CGI filled), and the Characters were presented unconventionally conceivable (for a Superhero film). To me this first movie seemed to be more of a Character/Team development bonding task of sorts. I know it got poor to mediocre early reviews, but I've noticed most of the (poor rated) reviewers are non 'comic book readers'. Just go in not expecting much (kind of what I did) and you just may enjoy it.",7,1,5,17 November 2017
Wonder Woman," Easily The Best DCEU Film To Date! Simply 'Wondrous'!
","As someone who's followed Wonder Woman since Lynda Carter graced the role of the iconic Character in the 1970's to the current modern rendition via the comic books, Wonder Woman has always captivated my curiosity. However it wasn't all that easy for this character to become the iconic figure she is today. Sexism (at least in regards to Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman), has come a long way. And after years of overcoming such hurdles - here we are, the unthinkable became a reality and Wonder Woman has finally arrived in her own major motion picture.Although I was quite delighted that there was finally going to be a Wonder Woman on the big screen, I will admit I was quite skeptical at first of Gal Gadot playing the part (absolutely and 100% nothing personal), and I laid open that if I were wrong about this conclusion that I would admit I was erroneous via my skepticism. A part of me thought 'if this rarity of Wonder Woman on the big screen gets screwed up, it won't be given another chance in a very long time'. I now understand why they went for a slightly more slender look - there was a fair bit of backlash with that decision due to the fact that when most people think Wonder Woman, the first thing that comes to mind is her immeasurable strength, but many of us forget how immensely swift and agile she can be. Thus this is why Gal Gadot's appearance and/or how she was portrayed complimented the best of both worlds, and is why it really seemed to have worked in this film. That been said my congratulations to Gal Gadot, Patty Jenkins and Zack Snyder. The film was absolutely extraordinary, and my uncertainties can finally be put to rest. As for Chris Pine playing the role of Steve Trevor. Hey it's Chris Pine were talking about... of course he pulled off the part splendidly! The rest of the cast was meritable and they complimented one another quite fittingly.Finale Verdict: What made this picture work was how everything seemed to have flowed in near perfect harmony, from screen writing and production, to cast and crew - the end result was nothing short of spectacular. What intrigued me most was they took classic Wonder Woman Lore, and still managed to fuse modernized mythos into the story. The beauty about this Superhero film in particular is whether you're a Wonder Woman comic reader or not, this motion picture delivers for both readers and non readers alike. Although I had a couple minor qualms, they were so minuscule that they aren't even worth mentioning. Not only is Wonder Woman an inspiration to women and girls around the world, but men and boys alike. So go out and see this 'Wonder' on the big screen, you won't regret it!",9,12,25,4 June 2017
