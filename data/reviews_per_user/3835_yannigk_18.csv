Men in Black 3," Highly entertaining show
","It's been so long since the last movie came out, I basically forgot all the storyline. However, this did not matter, as the story is basically a new one (of course you have to know what the neurolyzer does).Josh Brolin was an excellent choice. As the young K, he owns it. He's suave and slick, and yet as charismatic as Tommy Lee Jones. I hope to see more of him as an agent in black.Will Smith is as entertaining as he could be. It's good to see both him and Josh banter back and forth.I saw this in 3D and although the glasses in my cinema sucked (it was the small type, with slight color run if I tilt my head), the time travel sequence was exciting! I had to hold my breath at some point before breathing again. The sequences with the unicorn guy showing probable futures were also interesting.Only a small thing that I didn't like: the last plot twist. (SPOILER) Why didn't Will Smith just jump back in time to kill young Brutus like he did when killing old Brutus? Of course the filmmakers did point out 'where there is death, there will be death'. But still, he could've saved his own father.And why K start singing 'Empire State of Mind' in the end baffled me.But overall this is a highly entertaining movie, recommended for a weekend fun!!",8,0,4,13 June 2012
Mission: Impossible III," Impossible is Nothing
","So I stole that line from Adidas, big deal.Yes, I have just watched M:I 3, a type of action movie I haven't seen since the likes of Speed. (I'm not including King Kong and The Interpreter because they don't have secret agents in them, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith is more of a romantic comedy action movie, so.. ) The story is straight-forward. But not AS straight as M:I 2, I have to say, that one sucked.. even if I like John Woo. Story-wise it's almost like M:I 1.But the action! The action is GOOD. Good as in NON-STOP action, (and here I play the mission impossible song, bum bum, bada, bum bum, bada bum), just like Speed. With small breaks in-between just to show enough relationships between characters and the characters themselves.Some of the actions, such as the hanging flat off the wire thing, or the 'talk, or your girlfriend dies' trick, or the 'Chinese' girl (Maggie Q) doing a 'prayer' in Chinese (that one didn't work coz her Chinese actually sucked), or the trick of using a fake person under the rubber-mask just to scare ppl off (ok I'm talking too much here)... they're all just classics (a.k.a. old), but hey, some of them work anyway! And when they don't, who cares! The action, I give them 5 stars.Now go buy the cinema tickets and watch. NOW.",8,1,3,9 May 2006
Skyfall," Best Bond movie yet
","This is by far the best Bond movie yet. I don't even like Daniel Craig to start with, but he delivers so well. The script is very well written, delving into Bond's past, his insecurities & fears. There's not a moment where I felt bored in the movie.Characters were great: Judi Dench's M is impeccable, as always. Ben Whishaw & Finnes were also top-notch. Javier Bardem is going to be one of the best villains in movie history. He's creepy and annoying and cruel and unpredictable. I also have to applaud Berenice Marlohe, one of the Bond girls in the film. Her subtle but emotional performance is way beyond any other Bond girls before her. I would love to see her films more! This is the only Bond movie where I actually felt that all the characters had depth and purpose, and made me feel attached to each of them.Action-wise is definitely nice too. Unlike previous Bond movies (I'm referring to pre-Daniel Craig films) I always thought Mission Impossible's Ethan Hawke was the better spy, but now James Bond is just badass.What I love the most is the cinematography. It is beautifully crafted, with many scenes involving silhouettes. You'd have to see it to understand just how beautiful the colors are when projected on screen.Adele's theme music is also great, combined with again the best opening titles as of yet. Just the opening titles itself was worth the ticket (probably also because i'm an animator)! It's a fascinating combination of 3D and 2D, story symbols, and classic Bond colors/themes.",8,0,6,1 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Depp is great, CG is *almost* flawless, but it could be shorter
","Yes, I'm a late boomer in the pirates legacy. It's been open since Aug 3 and I only got to see it tonight. I think everybody must've seen it, but for those who haven't, go see it before you miss it.I never liked Johnny Depp the way everybody did. His type.. his looks... he's just not my cup of tea! I mean, yes, he's funny and witty and enchanting and has that charisma not all actors have but... what did I say about not liking him again? Wait, SCRAP that. I love him as Capt. Jack Sparrow! Aye aye, Captain! The movie, at 153 mins, could've been shorter though. I was sitting through the action packed sequences, and midway through I had to shift butt cheeks (ooh.. i'm getting better at this review thing~!).Love it when Jack Sparrow got into the satay form, meat between exotic fruits, trying to 'roll' away from the cannibalistic tribe. Love it when William Tucker (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley) kiss Jack Sparrow. Oh!!! The heartbreak! Love to see Jack Sparrow running funnily across the beach. Sounds clich√©, huh, but Depp just has this weird chemistry (and body language) to make the scene plain funny.OH and the CG!! OMG!!! Those are the best tentacles I've ever seen stuck on a man's face!!! Sheesh! How the heck did they do it?!?!! Did Bill Nighy wore a mask during production and then the tentacles added on in the computer? (If you read the trivia, it's: Yes, he did.) And I love the new Disney logo! Very pretty!! (That's what they get for buying Pixar down)",7,0,3,14 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Excellent adventure film!!
","If you were like me, a bit disappointed with Spiderman 3, you wouldn't be disappointed again. Pirates 3 was amazing - amazing CG, amazing complicated story that got me confused for a while, and amazing adventures. It's a classic Disney adventure film that will probably stun you the way Indiana Jones did. Just... wow.. The fights were long at times, but the camera work is so busy, makes you see something new in every other shot. There's action everywhere, and i mean EVERYwhere.. on the ship, off the ship, in the sea, in the air..Johnny Depp is gooooooooooooood.. i like him in this movie.. (i know lots of ppl would like him in any movie, but here, i like him best..) Chow yun-fat came out earlier than expected.. right at the start of the film (and left early, for that matter), the octopus guy.. Davy Jones.. man, i still don't get how they do his tentacles.. Orlando Bloom... he looks better with white hair (LOTR) haha.. well.. he looked better at the end of the movie where he wore a bandanna.. haha.. and Keira is too skinny and boyish.. hmph..The story plots is intertwined in such a complete mess, and yet i can't find any plot holes (or maybe i was too busy watching all the action i didn't have time to think of any).. it's not like any of those easier to watch adventure films like tomb raider, with only one storyline.. it goes back and forth, without the need of flashbacks! Amazing editing.. i wouldn't know how to edit the whole thing if i was given all that footage.. Just... really worth the price! even if they add HK$15 to the tickets!!! Better than spiderman 3 for sure..",8,2,4,23 May 2007
Spider-Man: Homecoming," A fun teenage coming-of-age movie
","I think I might've put my expectations a bit too high, the film feels a bit standard for marvel. It is up to par with Dr. Strange, for example, but not as memorable as.. er.. I guess Marvel's standards are pretty high. This one feels more down to earth. Spiderman fights his villains on his own, and so isn't bogged down by the large scale and heaviness of films like the Avengers. I particularly liked the opening scene with Peter Parker making a little video diary, with some scenes from Civil War in it. Totally what a 15 yo teenager would do. Tom Holland, as he did in his appearance in Civil War, is the perfect Spider-Man (and I'm a Tobey's version fan), and Tony Stark makes a pretty good mentor/father figure. I like that they only mentioned the fact that Peter lost his uncle just recently (we don't really need another spider bite and uncle death story). I wish there were more Aunt May scenes.Even though the general feel of the film is upbeat, I have to say that Tom delivered his rare emotional scenes perfectly. You feel his loss when he fails to be what he wanted to be. He reminded me of his excellent work in 'The Impossible' (must watch). The changes in this version of spidey takes him to a completely different universe. He still lags in school due to his 'other' responsibilities. But now he's the smart science nerd with his smart IT nerd friend, not the reporter-to-be kind of Peter Parker (I still remember Tobey's Peter taking pictures of MJ when he got bit). His suit and abilities are a bit different and mostly made by Stark, and I think spidey fans didn't like that idea. And I'm not sure I like the in-suit AI either (even though she sounds so soothing... it was Jennifer Connely's voice). But on the other hand it was pretty cool to see the different web effects the suit enabled him. Michael Keaton as the Birdma.. I mean Vulture.. he's menacing and vicious when he needs to be. Excellent play between him and Peter Parker. It's good. Fun, light, with some emotions interspersed throughout. The only bad thing.. well.. it's every other marvel standalone movie (well that's not bad actually because most of them are good too) and I guess we've seen those before.",7,3,7,10 July 2017
Nightcrawler," Intense thrilling psycho drama
","I kinda regret not seeing this in the cinema.Nightcrawler is an excellent disturbing drama thriller. The twisted story is not as twisted as Gone Girl, but it's close.Everything is driven by Gyllenhaal's character, Louis Bloom, need to succeed. His is an intense and disturbed character who at the start of the movie seems to mean well. He needed the money, it seemed, and figured out ways to find some. Since normal route didn't work (ie. he applied for a job after selling stolen wires, and the boss of the company made it clear he would never hire thieves) he found a better way of making money by becoming a news cameraman (with no moral ethic in mind).His sickness/psychotic madness is slowly revealed when he wants more and more, without us ever be able to think ahead of him, and he will stop at nothing.It's scary. Gyllenhaal himself is transformed into this nerdy*/autistic*/socially depraved man with eloquent talking. He charms and yet you feel uneasy around him. He can convince anyone to do his liking and you won't even see it coming. He's determined to get what he wants. We root for him, and then hate him, and then be appalled by what he did.*I don't really know how to describe his condition.. sorry if it was way too far from what he is.The intensity translates well into the movie. Pacing, camera work, banter between characters. It's a movie that is definitely worth your while.",8,0,1,18 March 2015
Baby Driver," Best movie of the year
","I haven't felt this good coming out of a movie screening in a long time.This movie spells F-U-N.Fun characters, sure most of them are clich√©, and it is deliberate! Just look at their nicknames: Doc (the mastermind), Buddy (the friendly muscle), Darling (the bubblegum-popping fierce gal), Baby (literally babyface kid), and Bats (the crazy one).This is played so perfectly to a point.Fun chase scenes. Familiar? Maybe, we've seen enough Furious movies. Smart? Most of the time. Fun? Absolutely.Fun romance. Ain't nothing more fun than an innocent teenage first date with a flirtatious (on both sides) counterpart in a laundromat. And they didn't even have to cheapen it with a sex scene. What a breath of fresh air there. Fun heist plot. It's almost like a different version of Ocean's eleven.Fun banter. A lot of pop cultural references. That Mike Myers joke is gold.Fun choreography. If you liked the opening sequence, it is followed by a fun MTV style of a character lip syncing and dancing timed perfectly to the lyrics of song - playing in Baby's headphones - literally written on the walls.Fun style. I am a sucker for 50s stuff - classic diner, classic mix tapes (well.. more 80s in that sense), classic cars, and a long drive to the west.Fun music. All I want to do now is to download the whole OST album. They stretched the final showdown a little bit but they nailed the ending. I leave the room a satisfied customer.Don't know if this is an actual easter egg: The disguise outfit that Baby took from the shop, ie. blue baseball cap and denim jacket, is the same outfit that Ryan Gosling's driver (in 'Drive') wears when escaping police pursuit.",10,1,5,25 August 2017
Over the Hedge," Truckloads of fun!
","It's a really good animation movie. Of course, not as good as Cars, but definitely better than Madagascar (I tell you, that was sh*t). Still definite is that it worths the price of the cinema ticket. The characters are C-U-T-E! Especially Sammy. Too bad I watched the Cantonese version because I think the lines would be much funnier if they were in English.The story could be better, it's a bit simple. But hey, it's cartoon, what do you expect? It's definitely whole load of fun. And funny, too.Best bits: When RJ warns the animals of the traps, 'here, here, here, here, here, here and here.. and here, here, here, here, here....' Also when Sammy gets high on caffeine and the world just simply.. Stops",8,0,0,14 August 2006
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," Almost the best in the MI franchise
","The best was obviously the first, and this one comes really close because of the existence of Ilsa Faust, the Femme Fatale. Really, Ethan Hunt could use a female accomplice that can fight her own.The action is as crazy as Tom Cruise could go for, putting my butt at the edge of the seat most of the time, and humor provided by Benji was just enough to neutralize the adrenaline-driven ride.The music for this particular episode was excellent, as it incorporates most of the original soundtrack from the TV show, including the 'Mission accomplished' soundtrack and others which titles i know not of. But, you will definitely recognize the melody when you hear it mixed into the various soundtracks in the movie.Ilsa Faust even has her own theme song based on Turandot, and made her the classic female character, reminding me of Ingrid Bergman.The only thing I wasn't happy about: the disavowed IMF. Again? Can't the IMF have a better leader and get normal jobs like the CIA or the MI6? I hope the next MI franchise doesn't put IMF as disavowed organization again.If you're looking for thrilling action, this movie is the one to go to this year.",9,0,4,8 September 2015
She's the Man," Hilarious chick-flick worth a watch
","I loved this movie. Even though I came out the cinema not remembering why I laughed so much, but I did laugh a lot. The dialogs are natural and flow well, and the boys' reactions to the girl (Viola) pretending to be a boy is just hilarious to watch. Especially in the tampons scenes.The script is well written as we see the plot falling into place before the climax scene. So what if we'd already guess what's going to happen in the end? It's fun to watch anyway.I recommend it to anyone who wants to have good fun in the cinema because it'll definitely make you laugh.",9,1,2,24 June 2006
Dunkirk," Intense film with excellent performances, but not his best
","Dunkirk: Based on real life events in Dunkirk France in 1940, 300,000 English soldiers were stranded on the beach awaiting help. Meanwhile, the French army (allies) blocks Nazi advancements and both the English and the French soldiers are running out of time and must get out of the beach, or be 'sitting ducks'. In terms of story, there's nothing to spoil, really, but in the case you don't like reading up about movies at any cost, well.. there would be some minor spoiler ahead. Dunkirk is a war movie. But more that that, it is a survival movie. There isn't much plot twist or clever reveals like the typical Nolan film. It is simply about men trying to survive, help, or fight the enemy. It's a short and efficient film (only 78 pages of script). There isn't any excessive blood or gore or blown up body parts, no soldiers praying or crying in vain. There is just surviving and escaping death. And death did not come in the form of evil German soldiers. I mean, fact dictates that the German soldiers were trying to kill them, but you see them as planes, unseen bullets, bombs, torpedoes. You don't actually see an actual German soldier. That is not to say that this film is not clever. Nolan's storytelling technique is still there with intertwining stories that meshes at the end. With little dialogue, the film expects you to pay attention and understand what is happening without too much exposition. If you think that Nolan films are sterile or devoid of emotions, in this film the choice is made on purpose. Not because there aren't any emotion, but because the emotions stirred in the audience is not manipulated by actors emoting sadness with tears or using sad music. You feel it as you see the things happening on screen. You worry, you fear, you find hope, lose hope, together with the characters. This is not a melodramatic film trying to make you cry. This movie was filmed in IMAX and if you're not watching it on IMAX at least watch it in a big screen. Aerial shots looked amazing, especially when your eyes are set on the plane body chasing and shooting down enemy bomber planes. I saw this in an IMAX cinema, and again the visuals looks amazing, but the score needs a mention. Hans Zimmer is again composing for Nolan, and this time there's no melody that you hum to by the end. But the tension is built by this pulsing music that feels like either bombs falling or loud heartbeats of the soldiers when enemy planes are passing.. honestly I can't quite tell them apart anymore, and also because the bass in my cinema is too loud. The screen actually jittered on loud tones. So the loud sound works well in most cases, but in a few cases the over bearing bass kind of ruined the visuals. However I think on a better calibrated cinema you won't see this happen. Another note was also the fact that I was looking forward to seeing Harry Styles in this film √∞≈∏Àú‚Ä† I'm not a particularly big fan of his or One Direction, I just thought he has a good expressive actor face and I wanted to see him in a movie. I expected him to die within two minutes (coz cameo roles work like that) but he got more screen time than I expected and his character reveal is unexpected too. The main character, well.. the first character we root for anyway, I don't know what his name is but he's beautiful! I mean, his facial features are so prominent and just.. gorgeous. Hope to see this young actor in more movies. And Tom Hardy as a pilot.... my gosh there was one shot where I could feel everything through his eyes only, at one point he changed his face from comfort to worry, through micro expression of his eyes.....! because the rest of his face was covered with his pilot mask. That's how good he was √∞≈∏Àú¬±The other pilot is played by a lad named Jack Lowden, a younger and handsomer version of Simon Pegg √∞≈∏Àú‚Äö sorryMy only complaint: (MAJOR SPOILER) it's a bit too nice a bow tied at the end. I guess I was expecting a Saving Private Ryan-sort of film where everybody is dirty and downtrodden and hopeless and dying. (END SPOILER)Conclusion: enjoyable movie, thrilling and filled with tension. Not my favourite Nolan film, but a good film nevertheless. Everybody was clapping by the end. 8/10",8,0,8,18 July 2017
Cars," Oscar winner
","Cars, like Toy Story, or A Bug's Life, or Finding Nemo, is just basically an Oscar winner. The animation is perfect (perfect to the little nibbles of dust). The story is classic and flawless. The emotions are definitely there. The Colors are oh-so-Techni! Owen Wilson is great as Lightning's voice artist (I recognized his familiar voice, not consciously knowing that it was him, although I think I did see his name somewhere before). There's a moral in the story. There are emotional moments. Funny moments. Romantic moments. Thrilling moments.Basically, the Oscar winning animation feature of the year. Most probably. 99%.Best bits: the little car-flies (no, not cars flying, but bugs, little car-bugs flying). OH, and the ending trailer when the cars watch The Toy Car Story, A Car Bug's Life, Monster Cars.. and the truck Mack goes, 'hey, that voice artist is good! Wait a minute here, they used the same voice artist over and over again!' Of course, that voice artist also did Mack's voice. LOL.",8,4,6,17 July 2006
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Joss Whedon is a genius
","Assembling 6 avengers, plus Nick Fury, was a tough feat in the first one. How Joss manages to outdo himself by adding everybody.. And I mean EVERYBODY even if they only had a short screen time.. Into a 2.5hrs movie is beyond me. People take for granted good scripts. Having more than 5 strong characters to talk or have a funny banter is just plain crazy. Add action, explosions, backstories, humor, wit, in a coherent and cohesive way without letting the audience lose the train of thought is simply an amazing feat. The dialogues are amazingly clever. By clever I mean they dumb it down enough for non comic readers to pick up where things were and St the same time assumes the audience are intelligent enough to 'get it'. The conversation between Banner and Romanoff was deep and the build up was all between the lines. Everything is implied and never in your face (except after you already got it).The film runs slightly on the long side, but I can't think of how it could be shorter. Everything builds up just enough for the finale. And the last 30minutes after the creation of Vision made it all worth it. If you haven't seen it you should, because this is the biggest most marvellous mega jumbo huge blockbuster of the year. Just look at the destruction! I have no idea how they are going to top this. SPOILERS/RANT BELOWThe humor! Oh! Iron man saying that high pitched sorry was hilarious! The deaths (including Romanoff lost chances) made me scream 'Nooooooooooooo!' inside. Each had their own build up very well written and shown so that we care a lot when they died. Anyone else sad when Jarvis, the computer programme, died? NooooooAnd Vision. Well what a vision! I need to rewatch this.",8,4,10,26 April 2015
The Da Vinci Code," Book is better.. as always..
","If you haven't read the book, go watch the movie. If you have read the book, go watch the movie anyway.The movie itself is good, but maybe because I've read the book (and thus know who the real bad guys are..) I couldn't enjoy it as much as someone who spent 2 hours thinking 'who the hell is the bad guy really?'. But then, the action is good.. surprises.. codes (in real pictures.. i love the part when Teabing explains about the Last Supper painting, you don't get that many pictures from a book).BUT, books will always be better than movies. As I expected, lots of details got omitted. Even though they did use flashbacks to explain history or past events, even though Tom Hanks talks 70% of the time.. there just ain't enough time to tell them all. As a book reader, though, I get to know *more* than other non-book readers do ;).So, watch the movie, then read the book. Or, just do one of them, Co once you know who the bad guy is then.. well.. you know.",7,0,1,24 May 2006
Wonder Woman," A light at the end of the tunnel?
","After the disappointments of Man of Steel, BvS, Suicide Squad.. I still had my hopes up for Wonder Woman, because she was the only thing that made BvS bearable!And finally this movie made it. It is a simple origins story, but that is beside the point. Gal Gadot brings to it a simple innocence and 'clean slate' sort of feel to the whole DCEU. For once, this hero had no excess baggage and just wanted to do the right thing.There's a lot other positive things that can be said about WW, but mainly the fact that we finally get a female superhero as the lead, in her own solo film, and what a good film it is, who is not seen as the sexy character, or the stupid 'i don't know how the world works' character, or one who needs help from her man (although she did get help, it wasn't because she needed it, it was because the world needed it). Thank you Patty Jenkins. Thank you for bringing us a strong independent woman, not afraid of bullies, or emotions!",8,3,10,21 June 2017
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Overall an entertaining film, with bits of random (unfunny) jokes thrown in.
","I had high hopes for it. The trailers promised a fun entertaining spy story that takes modern Bond's seriousness, and adds a bit of Austin Powers' silly humor.The fighting were fun and entertaining. Sharp, crisp, quick, and clean. The kingsman showed what it was to be a level above the others. Everybody did great. EDIT: I just found out I've missed a whole sequence of in-church fighting due to Indonesian censorship. Bummer.The evil plot: out of this world, and yet.. understandable. Sam L. Jackson was spot on with his delivery and the reasoning behind his evil deeds. And he was scared of blood.The downside: some of the jokes were... well.. unfunny, especially at the end with the *SPOILER ALERT* head explosions and butt f***. The explosions were done as a joke, with every head blowing up in sync and Technicolor to match the fireworks music. I kinda cringed at this.The offer from Princess Tilde was completely out of the blue. And the fact that young agent Eggsy accepted enthusiastically was very uncharacteristic of the young lead character. I mean, he had the best character and personality among all other cadets and him jumping at this odd chance is very.. unlike him.Basically the whole thing started off great (save for the cutting in half, I was a bit shocked, but.. I could live with that) and then there was a few shockers in the middle, and by the end it gets a bit random. Although, overall it was an entertaining film.Bottom line: I should like it more, but I probably had too high an expectation.",7,2,10,24 February 2015
Happy Feet," Amazing CG
","The story about a little penguin who can't sing but can tap dance is pretty good up to the last half hour. And normal. The little penguin Mumble is sooo cute. And the tap dancing is just so cute I don't know why the other penguins don't get it. The ending is a bit weird but..But the graphics! The whole thing is just crazy! The snow, the rocks, the fur, the wet fur, the melting ice, the wind, the snowflakes, the sunlight, the setting-sunlight, the water, the ice, the snow on the ice, and the snow the penguins tap on! Crazy!! Crazy!!!! And I'm saying this from a CG animator's point of view.The final half hour was like a dream (in a good and bad way). They actually have real humans in it! The direction of the story about Mumble going into the human world was weird in a way, but I think they did it just because they could! A lot of parts I seriously lost track of which human shots were real and which were computer animated. If the reason why they lead the story to human world is because they could do great mixing of CG and real live action, well.. they did a wonderful job.Definitely worth watching on the big screen. Even if it's just for the visuals.",7,0,0,27 December 2006
