10 Cloverfield Lane," Genre breaking
","Let's just put Fallout, Doomsday Preppers, Aliens and Das experiment in one movie is what the directors must have thought and it works. That's the only way to describe this movie without telling too much about the story. I don't think more should be spoiled about this innovative movie.",8,0,1,6 June 2017
Gone Girl," The defining of Mystery
","I'd like to start off with saying that I can understand the people that rate the movie with a 1, It's ridiculously harsh though. I think those are the people that rate a restaurant with a 1 when they see a hair in their soup. That hair in this movie is a lack of realism for some. Yes, you might say that some parts leave questions about how realistic it is, but that's not what this movie is about and not what the movie should be aiming for. It's about a journey for the viewers, to see what's going to happen next, you should let yourself go and see how a story about insanity is going to unfold. The story is thrilling, even though you might have a clue what would happen in advance, you still long for more, since surprises will follow. With two main characters that try to outsmart each other until the very end of the movie.Just lose yourself in the mystery that's going to unfold, as seen by the reviews, some people can and some people cannot. There's my two cents.",10,1,1,8 June 2017
