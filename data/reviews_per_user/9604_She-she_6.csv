Requiem for a Dream," DO NOT BE FOOLED, this movie is terrible.
","This movie takes drug addiction and turns it into a joke, but its not funny, and its not truthful. After watching this movie I wanted to vomit, but that did not make me feel the movie had accomplished anything. 'Trainspotting' was the first in your face drug movie and it handles the subject with much more candor, wit, charm, and truth. The characters in Requiem For A Dream do not stay with you, all you learn about it their stupidity, not their lives. The interesting Direction and visual storytelling cannot replace powerful characters or a half-decent story. Do not be fooled, this movie is terrible.",1,12,26,29 January 2002
Memento," Memento delivers more than what we expect from a film.
","The most thought provoking film I've seen in a long time. This movie was amazing because it was entertaining AND insightful. Christopher Nolan weaves an intriguing provocative story, which Guy pierce performs brilliantly. Funny, touching, and thoughtful.  Unlike so many of the movies in Hollywood, Memento forces you to engage, to ask questions, to wonder, to be confused, and to walk out of the theater wishing you know just a little bit more. See this movie and be entertained and invigorated.",10,0,1,17 March 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," This movie is an instant classic!
","Full of fabulous comedy, epic battles, and plenty of twists and turns, this movie was well above my expectations: it was amazing! Johnny Depp is brilliant as always, perfectly cast as the witty pirate. The plot was exciting and kept me guessing until the very end. I can't wait to buy the dvd. You'll want to watch it over and over again. This is not a summer movie that will be forgotten when the season is over, but is the summer blockbuster we've all been waiting for.",10,0,1,15 July 2003
Once," Just saw it after dying to see it at Sundance - Wonderful Music, Even Better Story!
","After hearing about this movie while at Sundance, I was sad I wouldn't get a chance to see it.Luckily it's gotten distribution!!! I just saw an advance screening in LA, and it's a wonderful movie with strong performances by both the main characters who are terrific musicians.If you've ever wondered if a movie could capture the true essence of performance, the awe of listening to something amazing and feeling it move you, it's here! This isn't a hackneyed musical with clich√©s, but a carefully captured story that feels more true than any other romance I've seen unfold.Go see it!",9,117,144,15 May 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Best Charlie Kaufman Movie Yet!
","This movie is a must see. It's the best movie I have seen in a while. It has the exciting plot of Memento, the heart of a fantastic Drama, wonderful comedy moments, and really spectacular acting. I went in expecting an interesting movie, something exciting that would make me think, and what I got was a fantastic film. Jim Carrey gives a subtle wonderful performance, and Kate Winslet is the most captivating romantic heroine ever. Gondry gets beautiful moments out of every scene, and Elijah Wood is refreshing as a dopey character for once. I personally am tired of him always being so cutesy. I'm not one to go into the particulars, but I want to stress that this movie is a perfect combination of thought and feeling. It manages to break your heart, inspire you, make you laugh, and surprise you all at the same time, and it is a very very difficult thing to accomplish that in a film. Go see it, go support wonderful film making. It's entertainment at it's best.",10,0,1,2 April 2004
Signs," It was going so well
","Signs starts off strong. It is a chilling movie, very suspenseful and scary. And then all of the interesting and though-provoking scream-inducing action and plot steps aside for a cheesy wraps up too nicely ending. It was so frustrating to feel so let down, when prior to the terrible ending I thought I was watching the best movie of the summer.",7,0,1,14 August 2002
